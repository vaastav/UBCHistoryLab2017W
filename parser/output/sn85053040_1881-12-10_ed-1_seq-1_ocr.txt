But w hat is of more interest to the people of this Territory, we are credibly informed that lie is a pro nounced enemy of polygamy and all other denominational, "cussednesses" ol Mor gi> of litt The Campbell Cannon case which is ex citing much interest throughout the coun try, and especially in territories inflicted with Polygamy, is arranged as follows by a Washington special: Mr. McPherson, prospective Clerk of the next House, is given as authority for the statement that probably the names of Delegates will not •be called tilt alter the House is organized. It is then probable that when Cannon's name is called, he will be objected to by Page of California, Ilaskell of Kansas, or some Other Western men. This will bring up the question who is entitled prima facia, to the seat, Campbell, who has the Governor's certificate, or Cannon, who has been placed on the rolls by the clerk? The precedent was established in the Forty Second Congress, when Cannon himself had the certificate, and Ids right to be sworn in, was challenged by George R. Maxwell, his contestant. Cox mid Potter of New York, and Hoar, ot Massachusetts, May• nardjof Tennessee, andjothers insisted that as Cannon had the certificate of election from the Governor of the Territory, he must be sworn in, and It a as done accord ingly. Eastf.rn Journalists are waking up to the urgent needs of the Mormon question The Chicago Inter-Ocean lias the follow ing appeal to Cotigress ill behalf ot this and neighboring Territories : "The quiet but persistent work of the Mormon missionaries planting their colo nies upon the best Territory of the regions beyond Utah should not escape the atten tion of statesmen or the public. They openly boast that they can control the bal lots of three of the Territories now. 1 lie crime of polygamy enlarges with each day. The coming congress can take effective ac tion on no subject which will meet with more unqualified approval than this. Nor should it he any half-way measure; polvg amv is a crime, and should be suppressed There is no reason why a Mormon, steeped in crime that would consign him to the penitentiarv of any Slate in the Union, should hold a seat in Congress and make laws for honest citizens. The time has arrived to ob'iterate polygamy, and legis lators who are too cowardly to do it should be invited to the rear. Legislators do not go much in advance ol the expressed public sentiment, und this public sentiment lias quietly allowed Utah Territory to be dis graced. Will it be quiet and allow Ari zona, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming to suffer a like fate? Unless Government In terferes, they will share the fate of Utah. The cry that Mormonism will die out, or is dying out, is a delusion. The devil and l.is work has thus fur in history proved a lively corpse." The Americans in Paris are moving to raise funds for the Garfield monument Six hundred Irish tenants have decided not to pay their rents except at a reduc tion of twenty per cent.

DILLON, BEAVERHEAD COUNTY, M- T. SATURDAY DEC. 10, 1881. No. 43. —______ i Hnyopsls of the President's Message. Washington, Dec. 6th __ To the Senate and House of lit fresentatives of the United States: An appalling calamity has be fallen the American people since*their cho sen Repiescntativcs last met in the halls where you are now assembled. We might else recall with unulloyed content the pros perity witli which, throughout the year, the Nation has been blessed. Its harvests have been plenteous, its varied industries have thriven, the health of its pi ople has been preserved. It has maintained with foreign gi> eminent* the undisturbed relations of UM.itv and peace. For these manifestations of Ills favor, we owe to Him w ho holds our destiny in His hands the ti ibute of our grateful devotions. foreign relations. Save for the correspondence to which 1 shall hereafter refer. In relation It > the pro posed canal across the Isihmus of Panama, litt to a at 17, un his ittle has occurred worth mention in the diplomatic relations of tiie countries. Burly in the year the Fortune Bay dnims'were satisfactorily paid by the Brit ish Government paving in the sum of £15, 000, most of w hich has already been dis tributed. As to the terms of* settlement, including compensation for injuries suffer ed bv our fishermen at A »pee Bay, there lias been retained from the gross award a sum which is deemed adequate for these claims. No new questions respecting the status of our naturalized citizens in Germany have arisen during the year and causes of complaint, especially* in Alsace and Lor raine, have practicallv ceased, through the liberal action of the Imperial Government in accepting our often expressed views on the subject. The application of the treaty of 1868 to the lately acquired Rheinisli province has received very earnest attention. A definite and lu.-ting agreement on till» point is confidently* expected. The participation of the desesndents of Baron Von Steuben in the Yorktown fes tivities and of their consequent reception bv their American kinsmen, strikingly evinced tiie tie» of good will which unite tiie German people and our own. Our intercourse yvith Spain lias been friendly. An agreement concluded in February last fixes a term for the labors for the Spanish and American Claims Com mission. The Spanish Government lias been requested to pay tiie late awards of the Commission nud will.it is believed, ac cede to tiie request as promptly and cour teously as on to nier occasion». By recent legislation onerous rules have been imposed upon American shipping in Spanish* and Colonial ports for slight irrégularité manifest. It is desirable that our cordial relations with Russia should be strengthened by proper engagements, assuring to peaceable Americans who visit tiie Empire the ton sidération which i» due them as citizens o a friendly State. This is especially need ful with respect to American Israelite whose classification with the Hebrew has evoked energetic remonstrances from till Government As is natural with contlglnus Stales hav ing like aims of advancement and develop ment, the friendship of the United States and Mexico has been constantly maintain ed. The Government lias lo»t no occasion of encouraging the Mexican Government to a beneficial realization of the mutual ad vantages which will result from more in timate commercial interchange and from the opening of the rich interior of Mexico to railroad enterprise. I deem it important that means be provided to repress the law - lessness unfortunately* so common on the frontier and to suppress the foray s of the 1 enervation Indiuns on either side of the Rio Grande. In regard to the Inter-Oceanic canal the President says : The question growing out of the propos ed inter-oceanic water wav across the Isth mus of Panama are of grave national im portance. This Government has not been undutiful in tilt solemn obligations im posed up>'n It by its compact of 1S46 yvith Colombia as the.independent and sovereign mistress ol the territory crossed by the ca nal and lias sought to render them effect!, e bv fresh engagements yvith tiie Colombian Republic looking to their practical execu tion. The King of the .Sandwich Islands on the course ot his homew ard return alter journeying around the world has lately visited'this country. While our relations yvith that Kingdom are friendly, this Gov ernment has viewed with concern the efforts to seek replenishment of the di minishing population of the Island from outward sources to a degree which may impair their native sovereignity and inde pendence In which the United States was first to testify a lively interest. 

YORKTOWN CELEBRATION In relation to the Yorktown Celebration the Presidend savs: The presence of reh resentatives of the French Republic, the decendants of Lafayette and his gallant compatriots, who were our allies in the Revolution, has served to strengthen the spirit of good will which has alway isled between the two Nations. 

BI-METALLIC CONFERENCE No agroee nient was entered into by the Ui-Metallic Conference held last summer at Paris, but a valuable interchange of views yvas had and tiie conference will be reneyved next year. THE SILVER QUESTION. Upon this important subject to the people of silver producing States and Territories the President says: I approve tiie recom mendations of tiie Secretary of the Treas ury* that provision be made.for tiie early retirement of silver certificates and tliut the act requiring their issue Ik* repealed They were issued in pursuance of the poli cy of the Government to maintain silver at near the gold standard and were according ly made receivable for all customs, taxes and public dues. About f/.,ono.ouo of them are now* outstanding. They formed an unnecessary addition to the paper cur rency and a sufficient amount which may be readilv supplied by the National Banks in accordance with the act of February 28 1S7S. The Treasury Department- ha» monthly caused at least 2,000,000 in value of silver bullion to be coined into standard silver dollars, 102.000,000 of these dollars have already* been coined while only about 34.000,000 are in circulation. * For the reusons which he specified 1 concur in the Secretary 's|recommemla tion. that the provision for coinage ot a fixed amount each month U* repealed and heuraftrr only so much be coined as shall he necessary to supply the demand. _ 1 lie Secretary* advises that the issue ot gold certificates should not for the present be re sumed, and suggests that the National Banks niav properly be forbidden by layv to retire their currency except upon reasonable notice of their intention to do of 1 a lie by do Such legislation would seem to he justified bv the recent action of hunks on the occasion referred to in the Secretary 's report. 

FRACTIONAL CURRENCY. Of the fifteen millions of fractional cur rency still outstanding, only about eighty thousand has been redeemed during the past vear. The suggestion that this amount may properly- be dropped fi rm fu ture statements of the public debt seems worry of approval. i lls: PUBLIC DEBT. Tiie President, after giving an immense arrav of figures relative to the financial condition of the country, sums up as fol lows: It is estimated that even it the an nual receipts and expenditures should con tinue as at present, the entire debt would be paid in ten y eats. In view, however, of the heavy load of taxation which our people have already borne, yve may well consider it is not the part of wisdom' to re duce the revenues, even if we delay a little the payment of the debt. the army. The Secretary of War recommends the legislation necessary to increase the num ber of enlisted men to thirty thousand, the maximum allowed by law. ' This he deems necessary _ to maintain quietness on our ever shifting frontier: to preserve peace and suppress disorder and marauding in new settlements; to protect settlers and their property against Indians and against tiie encroachments of intruders, and to en able peaceable emigrants to establish homes in the most remote parts of our country*. THE 

BEASTLY INIQUITY. For many years the Executive, in ids annual message to Congress, has alluded to the necessity of stringent, legislation for the suppression of polygamy in the Terri tories, especially in 'Utah.' The exist ing statutes for the punishment'of the odious crime, so revolting to the moral, re ligious sense of Christianity, has been per sistently and contemptuously violated ever since its enactment. Indeed, in spite of commendable efiorts on the part of the authorities who represent the United States in that Territory, the law has in very rare instances been enforced and for a cause to which reference will presently Ik* made, is practically* a dead letter. The fact that the adherents of the Mor mon Church, which rests upon polygamy as its corner stone, have recently been peo pling, in large numbers, Idaho, Arizona, and other of our Western Territories, is well calculated to excite the liveliest inter est ami apprehension. It imposes upon Congress and the Executive the duty of arraying against this barborious system all the power yvliich under the Constitution and law, they cun yvield for its destruction. Reference has been already made to the obstacles which the United States officers have encountered in their efiorts to punish violations of layv. Prominent among the obstacles i* the difficulty of procuring legal evidence sufficient to warrant a com letton, even in the case of the most uolui ion» of fenders. Your attention is called to the m en; . tion of the Supreme Court of tin: United States explaining its judgement of the re versal in the ease of Miles who had been convicted of Bigamy in Utah. The Court refers to the fact that the secresy attending the celebration of marriage in that Terri tory makes that part of polygamy very difficult, nod the propriety is suggested of modifying that layv of evidence, which now makes a wife Incompetent to testily against her husband. The suggestion is ap proved. I recommend, also, the passing of an act providing that in the Territories of these United States, the fact that a woman has been married to a person charged w ith big amy shall not disqualify her as witness up on Itis trial for that offense. I further recommend legislation bv which any person solemnizing a marriage in any of the Territories shall lie required, under stringent penalties for neglect or re fusal, to file a certficnte of such marriage in the Supreme Court of the Territory, un less Congress may devise other practical measures for obviating the difficulties which have hitherto attended the efiorts to suppress the iniquity. 1 assure you of mv determined purpose to co operate with you in nnv lawful and discreet measures which may be proposed to that end. UI ITEAl'S TRIAL. Judge Lawrence, First Comptroller of the Treasury, who took a square look at Guiteau from the Judge's bench, says of tin- prisoner» head : it is almost Hat on top from forehead to crown, which rises prominently and almost from the nape of the neck. This if I un derstand anything of prenologv, indicates sanitv, self-conceit, tiie latter strongly de veloped. I have not, he adds "studied the evidece submitted in the case, but it shows Guiteau to have had a distinct idea of tiie enormity of his crime then it will appear that the only motive for it was that lie fell aggrieved over his treatment in the matter of tiie Paris consulate. His self-conceit yvas hurt, and he wanted revenge; and this should not lie considened insanity*. It is the opinion of one of the Govern ment experts that the putting of Guiteau on the witness statid was the first serious mis take Seovlile had made. "It is," said the gentleman, "rapidly* clearing my mind of troubles as to tiie prisoner's responsibility. It presents altogether a new phase ot the case. The cross examination lia» been so far, one of the most remarkable I ever lis tened to, or read. I think it has already done more to satisfy experts of the assas sins's responsibility at the time he commit ted the crime, than anything else yvliich has been brought to our attention. It gives us a better insight into the man's mental condition than we have before ob tained." Judge Porter having elicited from Gui teàu the assurance he had not read much atsiut Napoleon, asked him, if in saying the President's nomination was an act of God, lii» election was an act of God, hi» re moval yvas an act of find, he didn't have Napoleon's bulletins in his mind. Appar ently gratified Guiteau said, that's the way I express mv'elf in sharp sentences. If vou want a specimen look through my book. Porter —1 think you have a remarkable power of brain and whatever vour brother in-law may think, I appreciate your abili ty. Prisoner—I thank you for you good opinion. Porter—I think that'» the opinion of every juror. Prisoner—I take mv chance before this Court and Jury on the fact that Jliety in spired the act. Guiteau left the witness stand last Satur day afternoon after his three days' siege. A broken man he was, tired out. haggard. faded, disgusted, sullen, ugly, and there seemed to be alxiut him an evident feeling that judge Porter, the terrible cross-exam iner, had despite his cunning theories and his persistance in them shown Hint the in spiration theory was simply a part of the defense planned long before the malice of Guiteau brought him to tiie river's hank to fire at the marsh reeds for targets. Do you feci any- remorse, was the last question which Judge Porter asked. After having been pressed earnestly upon this point for some moments tiie prisoner answered sul lenly and desperately. I have felt re morse of course, as far as my personal feel ings are concerned. Judge Porter, quick as lightning and dramatically said, that will do, prisoner: your cross-examination is closed. Guiteau, yvriihing under the tre mendous force of Judge Porter's question, saw the terrible effect of his confession. During nil these months one part of hi» de fense has been to insist to all lie never had, had a single sentiment of remorse. Dur ing the cross-examination he said a dozen times, to Judge Porter's questions, his niirnl was a blank upon that subject. To all tin ex verts who called upon him; that hi mind, unon that * suVject. was blank. Yet at the close of the last day's rigid cross-ex amination tiie prisoner admitted that which seemed to bring sadness to his relatives, and caused a sensation in Court, lie had killed the President and suffered remorse. $ orresffaifiletfre . 

WASHINGTON" LETTER [From our regular Corrrsponclcnt.| Washington, Dec. ist, 1SS1. It of If of There is life enough about Washington now. The clans have )>een gathering rap idly for some days and buzzings are heard yvliich indicate the renewal of hostilities on Capital hill. The chaotic condition to which vacation, neglect, dust and aband onment reduced even the grandeur under the Capital dome, has suddenly disappeared and new life has taken possession of the corridors «o long deserted save by the look er-on. During the past week employees have been dusting and brushing, and new Congressmen strolling here and there fa miliarizing themselves with the various wavs and by-way» of the building which they expect to make tremble with the thunders of their eloquence. The attend ant retinue of clerks and assistants are in their places and stranger», office-seekers and loungers are pyervwherc. Every thing lias been put in apple-pie order, l'he Senate chamber is as complete and tidy as a lady's parlor—warm, nice, dry, cheery comfortable— und the Hall of Representa tives is scarcely anything behind: all is us elegant as for a bridal party. The renewal ol activity is not confined to the abodes of Congress. It is everywhere about the citv—the hotels, the b ending houses and all p'aces of resort. Congress makes Washing ton. For several months, except at the time of President Garfield's lurteT.iij'tfiie trite! lorriJor» have been de serted and lonesome places; now Urey arc thronged da\ and night and one only has to visit tiie different headquarters to meet hundreds ot familiar faces that do not be long here, and in see groups of office-seek ers, Congressman and lobbyists, button holing each other for dear life. One even ing w hile the speakership* contest was at its zenith of imccrtujntv 1 saw in the lobby of a pmminent hotel at otic time three candidates for Speaker two for Clerk of the Hon e, one for Sergeant at-Anns and about twenty-live aspirants for lesser posi tions. There were also two ex-governors and several ex-congressmen aiding the can didates in their attacks oil the poor unsus pecting inemiicrs-eleet, of whom a goodly number were in the crowd. The Con gressmun is an important personage at such a time, and when it is all over and everything settled he must feel lonesome— as though lie had lost his best friend. President Arthur lias at last gone into the Whitt House to live. Everything is as neat and bright as a new pin since the old house has been fixed up. The Presi dent t\iii occupy fora sleeping-chamber u loom that ha.» rarelv been used for that pur pose by tiis predecesssors, though Gen. Grant occupied it for a short time. It is very spacious, measuring alxiut thirty by twenty feet, and is over the private dining room.' It is fully as large as the Red Par lor down stairs. During Gen. Grant's two term» this room was known as "Mi»s Nel lie's room," being that usually occupied by his only daughter. The chamber is on the north side ol the house and with the smal ler room adjoining occupies the nortl west corner. The sun never shines on the large room. The small one will be so to speak, tiie President's Ixmdior and com munis ateswith the larger one by a mahog any dno>\ The q gestion that has lately agitated our society circles is, "what lady will 'preside' nt the While House, and as sist at receptions, etc?" But it has been settled by the Piesident, who says that the wife of a member of his Cabinet—whose 'lame is not yet made public—will assist him in dispensing the hospitalities of the Executive Slansion. In fact lie expect» all indies of his Cabinet to come to the rescue in doing the honors. His married sister has cares enough of her own and tiie un married one is not physically able to per form the duties. There will be none hut formal entertainments given at the man »ion tliis winter—tliat is to say dinner par ties and public evening receptions. No one w ill lie there on whom tiie Indies can call sociably as they have been in tiie habit of doing heretofore. Dom Pkiiko.
