HAWK. CMIMB. Last Tuesday thc body of a young girl wa; found in the take, The next day several pee- sons ulentiUed the body as that ot a daughter of a railroad engineer, Deli ll;iwes. Mawi lived in the suburbs of the city with a wifi and several eiitldren. Hawes left town Monday, officers went to the house, but found It closed and the family gone. Tb ,1 evening a negro woman Informed the eorone that lust Saturday Hawes left this girl tn her charge for a few dnys. Monday night about 8 o'clock he called and tooli tho g rl aw-ay, saying that be was goin' to jdace be tn a convent ui Montgomery. Those who bnew tho Hawes family bel.eved that the mother, too, had beoa murdered and the body concealed. The couple had ' een divorced and he had taken one child, ahoy, from the mother and sent htm to a brother tn Atlanta. Monday Hawes married m Col'imbos, M ss and was passing through here w ith his second wife on his way to Augusta, On., when he was arrested, lie wus a little agitated at tlrst, but when closely quest oned at tho jail and told that one of his children had been murdered he seemed apparently unconcerned, and said that he had lett May and unother little girl some davs a0 with her mother, and that all of them hud already gone to tho mothers relativei somewhere in Maine, AH the weeli circumstances have teen com Ing to light tending to prove Hawos as the murderer of the g it, and that h had also killed her tnotli-T. It was proven bv several w.tnesses that Hawes went to Lust lal.t with t lie little g.rl about 7 o'clock Mou day night, nnd returned alone about fto'clocli. The girl's body was found In the lako uexl morning, Hawes protested his innocence, but has not ottempted to prove an alibi. It Is non- learned beyond doubt that ilawes was not di vorced troip his llrst w fe, and, lii a note writ ten to Ids young bride, ho odmits that he do. ee ved her about his children and his llrst wife. The negrt-'s Funny Bryant, with whom Hawes left his wifo and daughter, wns nrrested ns an accomplice in tlio crime, as was also Albert Patterson, who had been living with her. Iloth told confining stories. At 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon the startling announcement was made that tho foully mur dered and mut lated tody of the missing mother, Mrs. Minma h. Hawes, had been found in the lako at I. nko View, a suburban resort, and half a mile only from Kast lake, wiieri tho body of her daughter. May was recovered. . In . hall an hour thousands of men, women nnd children lain ied forward to thc lake. The snpicion gained ground early In the day Unit perhaps the body had been secreted there, as it was only nbout si yards' from Hawes' home. About 11 o'clock four determined men set to work to drair tho lako with grappllng hoolis. About 1 o'clock one of tho hooks struck t heavy, yielding substance, and loon the mu. turned corpse lay' on tho bonk. The com. bleed strength of lhe four men was required to land :t. The body was weighted Hewn with heavy nieces or "nsh-plale" rail road Iron tied umund the ueck mid waist ol the murdered woman. , Blie was completely clad, and about hor waist and neck were tied heavy scarlet cords known to have been at tlio Hawos residence, to which were attached en iron pieces weighing about ten rounds each. The hack ol tho deatl woman a . skull told the horriblo lorv ol the ' tragedy. It hail been rrnshed In with some blunt Instru. meat, presumably an axe. The entire occipital Iwne was crushed In and there was a gaping cavity that was only halt concealed by her heavy hair. Her right hand win ba uy smnnea across the back, as If Injured In o struggle for lite, and the annoarance of the face and hands tndlrnted thai tho body baa been ta the water wtsrnl risvs. The body, ns soon as found, wai taken to tho shore and laid out with the iron weights which had held It to tho bottom still attached. As ha hml. I, iv on I the bank the crowd of curious and Indignant ' spectators which withered around was momentarily in creased until It swelled into a mrging multi tude. The feeling of horror, indignation anu ri. increased with each moment until It threatened to become a frenxy. Fierce threats of yengoanco were heard on all sides Strong men almost cried in tho Intensity ot thc. r ex citement. Meanwhile the search for tho body of a sec ond child wont on. but up to a lato hour it had not been found. That It was thrown Into the a with its mother, however, is now a cer tainty, and its llnding Is only a queition of a short time.
