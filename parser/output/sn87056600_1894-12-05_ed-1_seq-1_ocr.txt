The following is the president's message, which was trans mitted to congress today: The assemblage, within the nation's leg islative halls of those charged with the duty of making laws for the benefit of a generous ami free people, impressively sug gests the exacting obligation and inexorable responsibility involved in their ta9k. At the threshold of such labor, now to be un dertaken by the congress of the United States, and in the discharge of an executive duty en J' lined by the constitution.

SCHEME hering to a firm, but just foreign policy, free ! - ,the ,Uni .f '425'0 from en or ambitious national schemes j y 0 and characterized by honesty. agvS prowing out of the controversy as During the past year pursuant to a law ; to fur seals in Bering !ea, or the pelz et congress, commissioners were app"infed ure of British vessels engaged in taking to the Antwerp industrial exposition, i -hough the participation of American ex- ! ... . ., . . . . , , ibitors fell far short of completely illus- Th hibi trating our national ingenuity and industrial . achievements, yet it was quite creditable in the brief time allowed for preparation. I have endeavored to impress upor the Belgian government the needlessnesa and positive harmfulness of Its restrictions upon the importation of certain of our food products, and have strongly urged that the rigid supervision and inspection under our laws are amply sufficient to pre vent the expor'ation from this 'country cf diseased cattle and unwholesome meat. The termination of the civil war In Bra zil has been followed by the general preva lence of peace and order. It appearing at an early stage of the insurrection that Its course would call for unusual watchful ness on the part cf this government, our naval force in the harbor of Rio de Janeiro was strengthened. This precaution, I am satisfied, tended to restrict the issue t a simple trial cf strength between the Bra zilian government and the insurgents, and to avert complications, which at times teemed Imminent. Our firm attitude of neutrality wa3 maintained to the end. The Insurgents received1 ti encouragement of eventual asylum from our commanders, and such opposition as they encountered was for the protection of our commerce and wa3 clearly Justified by public law. A serious tension of relations having arisen at the close of the war between Brazil and Portugal by reason of the escape of the insurgent admiral. Da Gama. and his fol lowers, the friendly offices of our repre sentatives to those countries were exerted for the protection of the subjects of either within the territory of the other. Although the government of Brazil was duly noti fied that the commercial arrangements ex isting between the United States and that country, based on the third section of the tariff act of 1S90, was abrogated on Aug. 2S. ISt. by the taking effect of the tariff law now In force, that government subse quently notified us of its intention to ter minate such arrangement on the first day of January, 1S93, in the cxercls-3 of the right reserved in the agreement between the two countries. I Invite attention to the correspondence between the secretary of state and the Brazilian minister on this subject. The commission organized under the convention which we hid entered Into with Chili for the settlement of the outstanding Ulms agiinst the other adjourned at the i l l uf the period stipulated for its con tinuance, leaving undetermined a number cf American cases, which had been duly presented. These claims are not barred, ami negotiations are in progress for their submission to a new tribunal. THE WAIl IX THE EAST. rteanona for Thla Government's Diplo matic Advances. On the 17th of March last a new treaty j with China, In further regulation of em igration, was signed at Washington, and on Aug. 13 it received the sanction of the senate. Ratification on tha part of China and formal exchange are awaited to give effect to this mutually beneficial convention. A gratifying recognition of the uniform 1 Impartiality of this country toward all foreign states was manifested by the co incident request of the Chines and Jap aneso governments that the agents of the Unit-d States shjuld. within proper limits, an rd protection to the subjects of the other during the suspension of diplomatic relations, due to a state of war. This deli rate office was accepted, and a misappre hension which gave rise to th? belief that In affording this kindly unofficial protec tion, our agents would exercise the earn- authority which the withdrawing agents of the belligerents had exercised, was pr inaptly corrected. Although the war 1) twen China and Japan endangers no policy of the United States, It deserves our gravest consideration, by reason of its clMturbanea of our growing commercial inter?: in the two countries, and the In- ! rend dangers which may reäult to our; c;tlz 'ns domiciled or sojourning in the in- ! tcr.or of China. i Aeibg un.hr a stipulation in our treaty wi h Corea (the first concluded with a west- ' tm power) I felt constrained at the begin ning of the controversy to tender our good To keep up with tho times you cannot afford to be without Harper's Weekly. Oaly 11 a year- offices to induce an amicable arrangement of the initial difficulty grow in? out of the Japanese demand for administrative re- forms in Corea. but the unhappy precipita tion of actual hostilities defeated this kindly purpose. Deploring tha destructive war be tween the two must powerful of the east ern nations and anxious that our commercial interests in those countries may be pre- served, and that the safety of our citizens there hall not be Jeopardized. I would m: hesitate to heed any intimation that our friendly aid for the honorable termination of hostilities would be acceptable to both belligerents. A convention has been finally concluded for the settlement by arbitration of the prolonged dispute with Ecuador, growing out of the proceedings against Emib Santos, a naturalized citizen of ths United States. Our relations with the republic of France continue to be such as should exist between nations so long bound together by friendly sympathy and similarity in their form of government The recent cruel assassination of the president of this sister republic called forth such universal expressions of sorrow and condolence from our people and govern ment as to leave no doubt of the depth and sincerity of our attachment. The resolu tions passed by the senate and house of rep resentatives on the occasion have been com municated to the widow of President Car not. Acting- upon the reported discovery of Texas fever in cargoes of American cattle, tha German prohibition against importations of live stock and fresh meats from this country has been revived. It is hoped that ' Germany will soon became convinced that this inhibition is as needless as it is harm- ; ful to mutual interests. The German government has protested against that provision of the customs tariff act, which impesfcs a discriminating duty of : one-tenth of one cent a pound on sugars com- i ing from countries paying an export bounty I thereon, claiming that the exaction of such duty is in contravention of articles 5 and $ ; of the treaty of 1828 with Prussia. In the i interests of the commerce of both countries, and to avoid even the accusation of treaty i . , i l Ä. I violation, a rt'commenn me repeal ui tu much of the statute as imposes that duty, and I invite attention to tho accompanying report of tha s-ecretary cf state, containing a discussion of the questions raised by the German protests. Ilerlnjr Sea Arbitration. Early in the present year an agree ment was reached with Great Britain, concerning instructions to be given to the naval commanders of the two gov ernment in Bering sea, and the contig uous North Pacific ocean, for the guid ance in the execution of the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration, and the enforcement cf the regulations therein i prescribed, for the protection of eeal life in the waters mentioned. An under standing has also been reached for the seal In those waters. The award and flnJin 9C. thf arl; tribunal to , extent, determined the facts and n which thf clairm shj. a great prinel- nle r.non nrhich 1he claims should be adjusted, and they have been subjected by both governments to a thorough ex amination upon the principles as well as the facts which they involve. I am con vinced that a settlement upon the terms mentioned would be an equitable and advantageous one, nnd I recommend that provision be made for the rrompt payment of the stated sum. Thus far, only Franco and Portugal have signified their willingness to adhere to the regula tions established under the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration. Prelim inary survey of the Alaskan boundary and a preparatory examination of the question of protection of food fish In the contiguous waters of the United States and the Dominion of Canada are in progress. The boundary of British Guiana Ptlll remains in dispute between Great Brit ain and Venezuela, Believing that its early settlement on some Just basis, alike honorable to both parties, Ls In the line of our established policy to remove from this hemisphere all causes of differ ence with powers beyond the sea, I shall renew tho efforts heretofore made to bring about a restoration of diplomatic relations between the disputants, and to induce a reference to arbitration, a resort which Gerat Britain so conspicu ously favors In principle and respects in practice, and which is earnestly sought Ly her weaker adversary. Hawaii KecoRTileiI. .Since communicating the voluminous correspondence In regard to Hawaii, and the action taken by the senate and house of representatives on certain ques tions submitted to the Judgment and wider discretion of congress, the organization of a government In place of the provisional arrangement which followed the deposition of the queen, has been announced with evidence of its effective operation. The recognition usual im such cases has been accorded to the new government. Under our present treaties cf extradi tion with Italy, miscarriages of Justice have occurred, owing to the refusal of that government to surrender Its own subjects. Thus far our efforts to negotiate an amended convention obviating this diffi culty have been unavailing. Apart from the war in which the Island empire is engaged, Japan attracts Increas ing attention In this country by her evi dent desire to cultivate more lib?ral inter course with u" and to seek our kindly aid In furtherance or her laudable desire for complete autonomy In her domestic affairs and full equality in the family of nations. The Japanese empire of today is no longer the Japan of the past, and our relations with this progressive nation should noil be less broad and liberal than those with other powers. Relations Trlth Mexico. Good will, fostered by many interests In common, has marked our relations with our nearest southern neighbor. Peace be ing restored along her northern frontier, Mexico has asked the punishment of the lata disturbers of hdr tranquility. There ought to be a new treaty of commerce and navigation with that country to take the place of the one which terminated thirteen years ago. The friendliness of the Intercourse between the two countries Ls attested by the fact that during this long period the commerce of each has steadily increased under the rule of, mutual con sideration, being neither stimulated by conventional arrangements nor retarded by jealous rivalries or selfish distrust. An indemnity tennerea Dy Jiexico as a gracious act, for the murder, In 1S87, of Leon Baldwin, an American citizen, by a band of marauders In Durango, has been accepted, and is being paid In In stallments. The problem of the storage and use of the waters of the Rio Grande for irrigation should be olved by appro priate concurrent action of the two in terested countries. Rising In the Colo rado hight. the stream flows intermit tently, yielding little water during- the dry months to the Irrigation channels al ready constructed along Its course. This scarcity Is often severely felt In the re gions where the river forms a common boundary. Moreover. the freauent chane-es In its course, through level sand.?, often raise embarrassing questions of ter ritorial Jurisdiction. THE 

HLVEFIELDS ISCIDEXT. MrrRBA Has Illsjhtfnl Domain Over the Slosqulto Strip. Prominent among the questions of the year was the Blueflelda incident. In what Is known as the Mosquito Indian atrip, i A fifty-two-week feast Is provided by j Harper's Young People for 12 a yea.. bordering on the Atlantic ocean and within the jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of ISfiO, between Great Britain and Nicaragua, the former government ex- , pressly recognized the sovereignty of the 1 latter over the strip, and a limited form ! of self-government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians, to be exercised accord- t lng to their customs, for themselves and j other dwellers within its limits. The bo- i called native government, which grew to ' be largely made up of aliens, for many years disputed the sovereignty of Nicaragua over the strip, and claimed the right to maintain therein a practically In- ' dependent municipal government. Early In the past year efforts of Nicaragua to I maintain sovereignty over the Mosquito j territory led to perious disturbances, cul minating in tne suppression or me native government, and the attempted substitu tion of an impracticable composite admin istration, in which Nicaragua and alien residents were to participate. Failure was followed by an insurrection which, for a time, subverted Nlcaraguan rule, expell ing her officers and restoring the old or ganization. This, Sn turn, gave place to the existing government, established and upheld by Xleararua. Although the lier interests arrayed against Nicaragua ira thee transactions have been largely American, and the commerce of that region for some time has been, and still chiefly controlled by our citizens, we cannot, for that reason, challenge the rightful sovereign ty of Nicaragua over this Important part of her domain. For some months one, and during part of the time two, of our naval ships have been stationed at Blue- fieLI for the protection of all legitimate interests of our citizens. In September last the government at Managua expelled from its territory twelve or more for eigners, including two Americans, for al leged participation in the seditions or revolutionary movements against the re public at lllueflelds already mentioned, but through the earnest remonstrance of thla government the two Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful management of their business. Our naval commanders at the scene of these dis turbances, by their constant exhibition of firmness and good judgment, contributed largely to tho prevention of more serious consequences and to the restoration of quiet and order. I regret that In the midst of these occurences there happened a most grave and irritating failure of Nicaraguan Justice. An American citi zen named Wilson, residing at Rama, in the Mosquito territory', was murdered by one Arguello, the acting governor of the town. After some delay, the murderer was arrested, but so insecurely confined or guarded that he escaped, and notwith standing our repeated demand?, It is claimed that his recapture has been Im possible by reason of his flight teyond Nicaraguan justice. The Nicaraguan authoris, having given notice of forfelt- ure of their - cone the canal con pany on groui.ds, cnnlcal and not embraced in tn tave recv.iK'd from that position Peru. I regret to ymptoms of domestic disturban Kobnbly to the elowness of her rei jti from the distresses of the war Weakened facing lnter- In resources, her difflcul national obligations Invite r kindly sym pathy and justify our forbearance in press ing long pending claims. I have felt con- strainea to cesiiry inia synipa.iny, in con nection with certain demand3 urgently preferred by other powers. Death of the Csar. The recent death of the czar of Russia called forth appropriate expressions of sor row and sympathy on the part of our government with his bereaved family and the Russian people. As a further demon stration of respect and friendship, our min ister at St. Petersburg was directed to represent our government at the funeral ceremonies. The sealing Interests of Rus sia In Bering sea are second only to our own. A modus vivendi has, therefore, been concluded with the Imperial govern ment restrictive of poaching on the Rus sian rookeries, and of sealing In waters which were not comprehended In the pro tected ara defined In the Paris award. Occasion has been found to urge upon the Russian government equality of treatment for our great life insurance companies whose operations have been extended throughout Europe. Admitting, as we do, foreign corporations to transact business in the United Stales, we naturally expect no less tolerance f or our own in the ample fields of competition abroad. But few cases of interference with nat uralized citizens returning to Russia have been reported during the current year. One Krzeminskl was arretted last sum mer in a Polish province on a reported charge of unpermitted renunciation of Rus sian allegiance, but It transpired that the proceedings originated In alleged malfea sance committed by Krzeminskl while an imperial official a number of years ago. Efforts for his release, which promised to be successful, were in progress when his death was reported. Tho government of Salvador, having beert overthrown by an abrupt popular outbreak, certain of Its military and civil officers, while hotly pursued by Infuriated Insurgents, sought refuge on board the United States warship Bennington, then lying in a Salvadorean port. Although the practice of asylum is not favored by this government, yet in view of the immi nent peril which threatened the fugitives, and solely from considerations of human ity, they were afforded shelter by our naval commander, and, when afterward demand ed, under our treaty of extradition with Salvador for trial on charges of murder, arson and robbery, I directed that such of them as had not voluntarily left the shrp be conveyed to one of our nearest ports, where a hearing could be had before a Judicial officer, In compliance with the terms of the treaty. On their arrival at San Francisco such a proceeding was promptly instituted before the United States district judge, who held tha: the acts constituting the alleged offenses were political and discharged all the accused except one Cienfuegos, who was held for an attempt at murder. Thereupon I was constrained to direct his release for the reason that an attempt to murder was not one of the crimes charged against him upon which his surrender to the Sal vadorean authorities had been demanded. Unreasonable and unjust fines Imposed by Spain on the vessels and commerce of the United States have demanded, from time to time, during the last twenty years, earnest remonstrance upon the part of our government. In the immediate past ex orbitant penalties have been Imposed upon our vessels and goods by customs authorities of Cuba and Porto Rico for clerical errors of the most trifling char acter In the manifests or bills of lading. In somo cases fines amounting' to thou sands of dollars have been levied upon cargoes, or the carrying vessels, when the goods In question were entitled to free entry. Fines have been exacted even when the error has been detected and the Spanish authorities notified before the ar rival of the goods in port. ThLs con duct is In strange contrast with the con siderate and liberal treatment extended Spanish vessels and cargoes in our ports In like cases. No satisfactory settlement of these vexatious questions has yet been raehpd. The Mora case, referred to In my last annual message, remains unsettled. From the diplomatic correspondence on this sub ject, which has been laid before the senate, It will be seen that this government has offered to conclude . convention with Spain for disposal by arbitration of out standing claims between the two countries, except the Mora claim, which, having been long ago adjusted, now only awaits pay ment as stipulated, and, of course, it could not be Included In the proposed con vention. It was hoped that this offer would remove parliamentary obstacles encoun tered by the Spanish government In pro viding payment of the Mora Indemnity. I regret to say that no definite reply to Harper's Bazar gives correct Informa tion about fashions for everybody, for $4 1 a year. SI t i 1 f ri.V thls offer has yet been made, end all efforts to secure payment of this settled claim have been unavailing. 

TIRKEY AXD THE ARMENIANS. The I'nlted taten Intereatea In See ing AYronjf Hlnhtetl. In my last annual message I adverted ta the claim on the part of Turkey of the right to expel as persona undesirable and dan gerous, Armenians naturalized in the United States, and returning to Turkish Jurisdic tion. Numerous questions in this relation have arisen.. While this government ac-qui-soea in the asserted right of expulsion, it will not consent that Armenians may be imprisoned or otherwise punished for no other rexson than having American citizen ship. Three of the assailants of Mis3 Mel ton, an American teacher in Mosul, have been convicted by the Ottoman courts, and I am advised that an appeal against the ac quittal of the remaining five has been taken by the Turkish prosecuting officer. A convention haa been concluded with Venezuela for tha arbitration of a long-disputed claim, growing out of the seizure of certain vessels, the property of citizens of the United States. Although signed, th? treaty of extradition with Venezuela is not yet in force, owing to the insistence of that government, that when surrendered, its citi zens shall ia no case be liable to capital punishment The rules for uie prevention of collisions at sea, which were framed by the maritime conference held in this city in 1S89, having been concurrently incorporated in the statutes of the United States and Great Britain, have been announced to take effect March 1. lsaü. and invitations have been extended to all maritime nations to adhere to them. Favorable responses have thus far been received from Austria, France, Portugal, Spain and Sweden In my lasa annual message I referred briefly to tha unsatisfactory etate of af fairs In Samoa, under the operation of the Berlin treaty, a3 signally Illustrating tho impolicy of entagllng alliances with for eign powers; and on May 9. 1SD t. in re sponse to a resolution of the senite, I sent a special message and documents to that body on the same subject, which em phasized my previously expressed opin ions. Later occurrsnces, thu correspond ence in regird to which will be laid be fore congress, further demonstrate that tha government which was devised by the three powers, and forced upon the Sa moans against their hostility ein be main tained only by the continued presence of foreign military force, and at no small sacrifice of life and treasure. The sup pression of the Mataafa Insurrection by the powers, and the subsequent banish ment of the leader and eleven other chiefs, as recited in my last message, did not bring lasting peace to the islands. For midable uprisings continued, and finally a rebellion broke out " In the capital Island, Upda, headed In Anna, the western dis trict, by the younger Tamasese, and in Atua, the eastern district, by other leid ers. The insurgents ravaged the country and fouerht the . Government troojs up to the very doors" (if Apla. The king again appealed to th yovers for help, and the British and Germar, naval forces reduced the Atuans to aprarent subjection, not, however, without considerable loss to the natives. A few days later, Tamasese and his adherents, fea'lng the ships and the marines, professed submission. Kejwrts received from our agents at Apia do not justify the belief that the peace thus brought about will be of long duration. It ia thtir conviction that the natives are at heart hostile to the present government: that.jach of them as pro fessed loyalty to it did so from fear of the powers, and that it would speedily go to pieces if the worships were withdrawn. It reporting to his j?overnment on the un satisfactory situation since the suppression of the late revolt by foreign armed forces, the German consuKat Apia stated: "That peace will be lastty? is hardly to be pre sumed. The lesson given by firing on Atua was not sufficiently sharp and incis ive to leave a lasting Impression on the forgetful Samoan lemperament In fact, conditions are exis ing which show that peace will not last, und is not seriously In tended. Malietoa, the king, and his chiefs are convinced that the departure of the warships will be a signal for a renewal of war. The circumstances that the repre sentatives of the villages of all the dis tricts which were opposed to the gov ernment have alrvady withdrawn to Atua to hold meetings and that both Atua and Aana have forbidden Inhabitants of those districts which fought on the side of the government to return to their villages, and have already partly burned down the latter, indicates that a real conciliation of the parties is still far off." In a note of the 10th ultimo. Inclosing a copy of .that report for the Information of this govern ment, the German ambassador said: "The contents of the reports awakened the im perial government's apprehension that un der existing circumstances the peace con cluded with the rebels will afford no as surance of the lasting restoration of tran quility in the islands." The present government utterly failed to correct, if, indeed, It has not aggra vated, the very evils it was Intended to prevent. It has not stimulated our com merce with the islands. Our participa tion in its establishment, against the wishes of the natives, was in plain defi ance of tho conservative teachings and warnings of the wise and patriotic men who laid the foundations of our free in stitutions, and I invite an expression of the Judgment of congress on the pro priety of steps being taken by this gov ernment looking to the withdrawal from its engagements with the other powere on some reasonable terms, not prejudicial of any of our existing rights. 

OPEIIATIOXS OF THE TREASURY. Receipt nnd Expenditures for the Yenr National Hanks. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources of revenue, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1S94, amounted to $372,S02, 498.29. and its expenditures to $442,C05,-7-.S.S7. leaving a deficit of $69,80.1,200.53.

The amount of bounty paid from July 1, 1894, to Aui 2S, 1S94, the tLm when further payments ceas?d by operation of law, was $366 .185.84. Th total expenses incurred In th? pxvment of the bounty upon sugar during the fiscal year wa3 $130.140.83. It is estimated that upon thi basis of the present revenue laws the reeeipts of tha government during the current fiscal year, ending June 3J. 1S95, will hi $424. 427,748.44. and its expenditures $144.427, 7K.44. resulting In a deficit of $20.0o0.000.

From the report of the secretary of war it appears that the strength of the army on Sept 30, 1S94, was 2,135 officers and 25,750 enlisted men. Although this hi apparently a very slight decrease com pared with the previous year, the actual effective force has been increased to the equivalent of nearly two regiments, through th- reorganization of the system of recruiting, and the consequent release to regimental duty of the large force of men hitherto serving at the recruiting de partments. The abulition of these de partments. It is predicted, will further more effect an annual reduction approxi mating $250,000 in the direct expenditures, besides promoting generally the health, morality and discipline of the troops. The execution of the policy of concen trating the army at important centers of population and transportation, fore shadowed in the last annual report of the secretary, has resulted in the abandon ment of fifteen of the smaller posts, which was effected under a plan which assembles organizations of the same regiments, hitherto widely separated. ThLs renders our small forces more read ily effective for uny service which they may be called upon to perform, increases the extent of the territory under protec tion, without diminishing the security heretofore afforded to any locality, and improves tho discipline, training and vprit de corps of the army, besides con siderably decreasing the cost cf its main tenance. Though the force3 of the de partment of the East have been some what increased, more than three-fourths of the army is still stationed west of the Mississippi. This carefully matured pol icy, which secures the best and greatest service in the Interests of the general wel fare from the small force comprising our regular army, should not be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the creation of new and unnecessary posts, through acts of con gress to gratify the ambitions or interests of localities. While the maximum legal strength of the army is 25,eOO men, the effective strength through various causes is but little over 20,000 men. The purpose of congress does not, therefore, seem to b? fully attained by the existing condition. While no consider able increase in the army is, in my judg ment, demanded by recent events, the policy of sea coast fortifications in prosecu tion of which we have been steadily en gaged for some years, has so far developed as to suggest that the effective strength cf the army be now made at least equal to the legal strength. Measures taken by the department during the year, as indicated, have already consid erably augumented the effective force, and the secretary of war presents a plan, which I recommend to the consideration of con gress, to attain the desired end. Economies effected in the department in other lines of its work will offset, to a great extent the expenditure involved in the proposition sub mitted. Among other things this contem plates the adoption of the three battalion formation of regiment, which for several years has been indorsed by the secretary of war and the generals commanding the army. Compact in itself, it provides a skeleton organization, ready to be filled out in the event of war; it is peculiarly adapted to our strength and requirements, and the fact that every other nation, with a single exception, has adopted thi3 formation to meet the conditions of modern warfare should alone secure for the recommenda tion an early consideration. Fiiprnnrii for the Year. It 13 hardly necessary to recall the fact that. In obedience to the commands of the constitution and the laws, and for the purpose of protecting the -property of the United States, aiding the process of fed era courts and removing lawless obstruc tions to the performance by the govern ment of its legitimate function, It became necessary In various' localities during the year to employ a considerable portion of the regular troops. The duty was dis charged promptly, courageously and with marked discretion by the officers and men, and the most gratifying proof was thus afforded that the army deserves that com plete confidence In Its efficiency and dis cipline which the country has at all times manifested. The year has been free from disturbances by Indians, and the chances of further depredations on their part are constantly growing more remote and improbable. The total expenditures for the' war de partment for the year ended June 30, 1894, No one who has taken Harper's Maga zine gives It up willingly. Tree, $4 a year. amounted to $56,039,009.31. Of this sum $2,000,614.99 was for salaries and contin gent expenses, $23,005,150.10 for tne sup port of tha -military establishment, 55. 001.628.23 for miscellaneous objects and $25,371.555.90 for public works. This latter sum includes $19,491.037.49 fr ri-.r and harbor Improvements and $3,947t.5i for fortifications and other works cf deiVnse. The appropriations for the current year aggregate $52.421. 112.78, and the estimates submitu-d by tne secretary of war for the next fiscal year call for approjorl ati;ns amounting to $52.318,629.55. The skill and industry of our ordnance officers and inventors have. It Is believed, overcome the mechanical obstacles vhieh have heretofore delayvd the armament of our coasts, and this great und rtaklnp. upon which we have entered, may n-.w proceed as rapidly as congress shall de termine. Wlih a supply of finished guns of large cabber already on hand, to which additions should now rapidly fullnv, the wisdom of proviaing carriages and em placements for their mount can not be tco eti'ongiy urwed. The total enrollment of the nv.itla of the several states is 117,533. oilers and enlisted men. an increase of 5.343 over the number reported at the close of the previous vear. The reports of militia inspections Ir regular army officers show a mirked in crease in interest and ttni..r.cy among the state organizations, and I strongly rec ommend a continuance of the policy of affording every practical encouragement possible to this important auxiliary of our military establishment. The condition of the Apache Indians hell as prisoners by the government f r eight years, at a cott of $:-oo.oo, has be-n change! during the year from captivity to one which gives them an opportunity to demonstrate their capacity f r self-up-port. and at least partial civilization. Lrg lslation enacted at the late session of con gress gave the war department authority b transfer the survivors, numbering 3:"., from Mt. Vernon barracks, in Alabama, to any suitable reservation. Th department selected as their future home the rrilitary lands near Ft. Sill. Indian Territory, where, under military surveillance, the form r prisoners have been established in agricul ture, under conditions favorable to their ad vancement. In recognition cf the long and distin guished military services and faithful dis charge of delicate and responsible civil du ties, by MaJ.-Gen. John M. Scholield, now the general commanding the army, it is suggested to congress that the temporary revival of the grade of lieutenant-general in his behalf would be a just and gracious act. and would permit his retirement, now near at hand, with rank befitting his merits. 

DEPART.MKNT OK JUSTICE. Recommendation of the Attorney General Snpreme Court. The report of the attorney-general nob'3 the gratifying progress made by the supreme court in overcoming the arrears in its bus iness, and in reaching a condition in which it will be able to di.-pase of cases as they arise, without any unreasonable delay. This result, of course, Ls very largely due to the successful working of the plan' of inaugurat ing circuit courts of appeals. In respect to these tribunals, the suggestion is made in quarters entitled to the highest consider ation that an additional circuit Judge f .r each circuit woull greatly strengthen these courts and tho confidence reposed in their adjudication, and that such an addition would not create a greater force of judges than the increasing business of fuch courts lfiuires. I commend th- suggestion to the careful consideration of the congress. Other important topics are adverted to in the report, accompanied rjy recommenda tions, many of which have been treated at large in previous messages, and at this time, therefore, need only be named. I re fer to the abolition of the fee system as a measure, of compensation to federal of ficers, the enlargement of the powers of United States commissioners, at 1-ast in the territories, the allowance of writs of error in criminal eases on behalf cf the United States, and the establishment of degrees in the crime of murder. A topic dealt with by the attorney-general of much importance is the condition of the administration of justice in the Indian territory. The permanent solution cf what is called the "Indian problem" is probably not to be expected at once, but meanwhile such amelioration of present conditions as the existing system will admit of ought nor to be neglected. I am satisfied there should be a federal court established for each ter ritory, with suitleient judges, an I that this court should tit within the territory and have the same jurisdiction as to territorial affairs as is now vested in the federal courts sitting in Arkansas and Texas. Another subject of pressing moment, referred to by the attorney-general, is the reorganization of the Union Pacific railroad company on a basis equit able, as regards all private interests and as favorable to the gjvernment as ex isting conditions will permit. The opera tion of a railroad by a court through a receiver, is an anomalous state of things, which should be terminated, on all grounds, public and private, at the earli est passible moment. Ilesides, not to enact the needed enabling legislation at the present session, postpones the whole matter until the assembling of the new congress, inevitably increases all the complications of the situation, and could not but be regarded as a signal failure to solve a problem which has practically been before the present congress since its organ ization. Eight years ago, in my annual message, I urged uKn the congress as strongly as I could, the location and construction or two prisons foi the confinement of United States prisoners. A similar rec ommendation has been made from time to time since, and a few years ago a law was passed providirg for the selection of sites for three such institutions. No ap propriation has, however, been made to carry the act into effect, and the old and discreditable condition still exists. It is not my purpose at this time to re peat the considerations which make an im pregnabla case in favor of the owner-hip and management by the government of the penal institutions in which federal prison era are confined. 1 simply desire to again urge former recommendations on the sub 1ect. and to particularly calt th3 attention of congress to that part of the report of the secretary of war, in which he states that the military prison at Ft. Leaven worth. Kas., can be turned over to the gov ernment as a prison for federal convicts without the least difficulty and with an actual saving of money from every point of view. Pending a more complete re form, I hope that by the adoption of the suggestion of the secretary of war. this easv step may be taken In the direction t the proper care of its convicts by the gov ernment of the United States.
