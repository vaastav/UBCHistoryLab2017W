Joseph Johnson, an old ami respect ed citizen iif (ireene county, residing jit'cr Xngo, came to his death in a ps cnlinr nianncr, and his wife is lying- at the point of death from tho panic cause. It seems that Johnson recently discovered some mineral on his land which lie believed to he silver and gold ore. Some of the specimens were given to an expert to test, which he did with prussie and other acids. Johnson conceived the idea of put ting the specimens in the cook stovo and melting them, while his wife was cooking dinner. After they had eaten a hearty meal both were taken sick, and a physician was called, who diag nosed the cases as poison. He says the it mils cooking on the stove al Mirlicd the prussie acid and other acid that had been used on i"?ie specimens of ore, and resulted in the death .l" Johnson and perhaps the fatal illness of his wife.
