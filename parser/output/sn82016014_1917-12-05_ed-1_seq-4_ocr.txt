Or shall it be ; , said congress has the president on its .j hands? Mr. Wilson in the past has been remarkably successful in obtain ing from the national legislature f j whatever he asked. The process has i been slow at times but he usually has ) had his way in the end. Since the i gentry of the United States into the ? world war, nothing has taken place to cause the country or the congress to I waver in their fealty to the man who r is guiding the destinies of the nation in its hour of trial. There is cause f for hepe and reason to believe that I the work of the nation's law makers I will proceed with less" friction, and with greater singleness of purpose than was evidenced during the last ."session.

The pacifists and .the willful ones are likely to have lit. j tle to soy. , -, Germany's defeat may be consid ered achieved when the German Armies are driven back to their own .frontier. , Until that moment, the very iTkgestion of peace is an affront. 'Germany would be very happy to go Xt the peace table, war-map in hand, j,t5 be bought out of France and Bel 'gilim. It is hard to be patient with "Ufiose who, with astounding ignorance .fit European affairs and inability to understand German methods, says the Public, persist in the belief that there Ik a German liberalism ready to re nounce the fruits of conquest and to remake Germirhy in democratic terms. 4Jne way, and one only is open, and that is to break Germany's military power. ' The attention of the entire country is- this week being systematically called to the white plague. Tubercu losis in its various forms caused 101, 396 deaths in 1916, of which 88,666 were due to tuberculosis of the lungs. Because of progress in the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis of all Kinds, the decline in the tuberculosis death rate in recent years has been most pronounced, having fallen from ZQ0.7 per 100,000 in 1904 to T41.6 in 1916, a decrease of nearly 30 per cent. Before 1904 the rate had fluctuated, starting at 201.9 in 1900. Even yet, however, tuberculosis causes more deaths annually than any other maU ady, except heart diseases, and about 7 per cent more than all external causes accidents, homicides and sul fides combined. r 

CHILDREN'S DAY. ' , Friday of this week has been desig nated as Modern Health Crusade day, by the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculo sis. The day will be observed in the schools thruout the country by the i modern health crusaders, the organi sation OX CUilUieil, HOW iUU.UUU SLTUIlg, which was brought into being a year ago as a part of the last Red Cross Christmas seal campaign. In this ob servance the National association has obtained the co-operation of school superintendents in cities of 10,000 pop ulation and over thruout the country- ..The object of the organization is not so much, to obtain money for the anti tuberculosis movement, as to give the ehildrenr definite' tasks whereby they can help the health campaign. Each Miild who becomes a modern health t-rusader receives a certificate of en rollment for doing a series of "health chores,' at least forty of which must be performed each week. Modern Health Crusade day will be devoted to interesting the children in the anti-tuberculosis and public health ttidvement. Use will be made of health plays, talks, composition con tests, motion pictures and other fea tures. Louise F. Brand's story, "Serv ing Uncle Sam," written for the occa sion, will be used in thousands of I schools as a feature of the program. , The children will also be enlisted an this day to self Red Cross seals. Spe- cial ranks and accompanying badges j viH be awarded to crusaders who sell i a given number of seals. THE MESSAGE. While President Wilson was deliv ering his annual address to congress at the customary time and place, he was really delivering a message from the American people to the nations of the earth. Never in the history of the world, perhaps, has a single speaker been able to address so large or so in terested an audience. The president's words are certain to command the serious attention of both friends and foes of this country. Those who have desired to know America's war aims should remain no longer in doubt as to what they are. The president has stated them in plain, unequivocal language, in, words that all can understand. First of all the president, speaking for the United States, demands an end to the Hohenzollern power in Ger many in order tha the German peo ple may be represented at the peace table by some one who can be trusted. lie demands that the wrongs inflict ed upon weaker nations by the central powers shall be righted. ,, He demands that territory acquired by the central powers thru force of arms shall be restored to its rightful owners. , He demands that Gerraa..j shall loosen her grip on the nations allied with her and permit them to shape their own future destinies. And when all this has been done he demands that Germany shall be treat ed fairly and generously and not be made to suffer; unduly for the wrongs committed ty: her present rulers. A liberty loving nation With the welfare of humanity and the world at heart could ask no lesa and could grant no more. ' 

WHAT WILL CONGRESS DO? Regardless of the fact that railway earnings are the greatest In history and that the roads are handling more business than ever before, their se curities are quoted at the lowest fig ure reached in eighteen years. If a complete- answer is to be given to the question of who is to blame for the present plight of the railroads, writes Francis H. Sisson in the New York Tribune, many contributing fac tors must be mentioned. Occasional instances of financial mismanage ment, altho few proportionately 1 other Instances of watered stock, al tho the railroads as a whole are un dercapitalized lack of , operating ef ficiency thru restrictive laws and reg ulations, lack of authority on the part of the interstate commerce commis sion to handle the whole situation with definite responsibility; political causes which make railroad baiting a popular pastime in many localities; the exactions of organized labor; tfle blindness of shippers to their own real interest in the matter; the unwilling ness of congress to legislate construct ively to meet the problems presented, and the ignorance and indifference of the general public tp the far-reaching effect of these- problems all these have a bearing on the case and must share the blame. Frequently there "has appeared a tendency to hold the interstate com merce commission responsible. But many Illustrations of the powerless ness of the I. C. C. to meet emer gencies presented might be cited. The benefits it may grant in rate increases can be, and have been in instances, entirely lost thru state interference. It may fix a fair passenger rate at two and one-half ce'nts, and be impo tent to enforce it against a state man date for two cents, and millions of rev enue be lost to railroads in this con flict "of authorities. It may refuse to impose burdens upon the carriers and yet see them forced by state enact ment. No man can serve two masters; neither can a corporation. A problem has arisen, which It is up to congress to settle and upon its answer prob ably hangs the issue of private owner ship or government ownership of the railroads. In the failure of congress to exercise more completely its power to regulate commerce the states have encroached upon its prerogatives, and are today actually regulating inter state commerce by Indirect ' methods all over the country. Like most oth er abuses of power, this has been a growth, until today the breaking point approaches. ; The railroads must be helped, per mitted to help themselves or quit busi ness. Reports received by the railroads' war board indicate that the railroad employes of this country took more than $50,000,000 worth of the second liberty bond issue. For the first bond issue 241,280 members of the rank and file of the railroad army subscribed an aggregate of $20,427,966. Reports on the subscriptions to the second issue show clearly that the amount which railroad men contributed to this loan is at least two and one-half times as much as to the first loan. The Los Angeles Times suggests that as an educational demonstration in Topeka a dog be hanged in order to impress upon the minds of chil dren the awful consequences of shoot ing or poisoning people whom they dislike. It is suggested that .the kaiser la, seekirg a decision on the western front. Well, if he continue to hunt for It ho it likely to find it. altho when be does it will not be to his liking. THE 

TOPEKA STATE JOURNAL raFCRMATIOK B0RBA0 87 FREDERIC J. HA8KIN, Director. WMhlntrtoa, D. C LEARNING TO WORK. I. . . ar Schools. Washington. Iec. 2. One kind of trai d man for wl-ich the government his a most pressing need right now is thn experienced anver wi trucks. The truck has displaced the army r.ule wherever there are roads and in many places where there are not. Food and ammunition go for ward on trucks from the base to the fighting line. It is not always the case that the man who has spent a few months or years driving ;. delivery truck over asphalt streets, with a traffic cop to tell him what to do, is qualified for this war work. At the front the prob lem is more apt to be that of directing his machine across a roadless piece of country, ulowed uu by shells, littered - -ith shattered equipment and shredsij of barbed wire entanglement, unin save by the occasional flash and glare of bursting shrapnel. And if this war driver fails to deliver his goods at the proper time, it will be a good deal : .ore serious than the irritation of some customer, for the success of an attack, the lives or men, may depend upon that delivery. Truck Irlvcrs Needed. When the' government need for the kind of truck drivers who could- be depended upon to deliver the goods under war conditions became appar ent, a certain educator in Minneapolis, Er. C. A. Prosser of the Dunwoody in stitute, set about the tr.sk of produc ing such drivers by schooling them in their duties. It is probable that the average man, so'dier or citizen, would not consider such an undertaking practicable. He would say that thedrivers would have to learn their business for the most part at least by the hard and expen sive process of trial and error in the field. For we have all come to look upon education as a sort of dispens able preliminary to the main business of life. We know that the college man comes away from his Alma Mater with "a head full of theories," which he has to forget before he can become really useful, while soma practical men even regard much edu cation as a handicap. Making Kducation Useful.' Doctor Prosser belongs to a new class of educators, who do not believe that education necessarily lacks this applicability to the practical ends of life, althought admitting that it gen erally does. They have set themselves to the task of making education use ful. So Doctor Prosser went at the truck driver problem in , characteris tic fashion by creating a little "no man's land" in a large field near his school. He equipped it with artifi cial shell holes, with entanglements and difficulties of all kinds, and he set his novitiate truck drivers the task of bringing their machines safe ly across it. He exposed them to every condition which a close study of tne war in Europe indicated they would be apt to meet in France. And he turned -out military truck drivers that could drive. Doctor ProBser's field of activities as a practical trainer of men has now been enlarged to include substan tially the whole county; for he has been made director of the Federal Board for Vocational Education, which is a new department of the government created by a recent act of congress for the purpose of using federal funds and the federal admin istrative machinery to help the states install practical training courses in the schools. In its application to civilian life It is a revolutionary meas ure, and means a new opportunity for the youth of America. That phase of it win db treatea in a separate article. For the present the board is directing its energies to work similar to that which Doctor Prosser undertook at Dunwoody the work of training men to fill the Industrial needs of the na tion at war. This, of course, is not what the board was created primarily to do, but a clause in the law under which it works gives it power to make investi gations and studies of methods of vo cational training. It regards the train ing of men for war work as an excel lent experimental investigation of such methods. Trained Radio Operators. t)ne of the first needs it set out to fill was that for trained radio oper ators. The Signal corps needed 15,000 ,of them, and they were nowhere to be found. Accordingly it turned to the board for advice. The board at once got into communication with leading schools In the states which had formed state boards to co-operate with the federal board, and suggested that these schools open evening classes at which men subject to the draft might learn the business of radio-telegraphy. The response both from the schools and from the men was prompt. There are already between fifty and one hundred schools for radio-telegraphers ,lu snout tnree thou- HAnfi m ,.r, r, ,n ... ,v, ;.. ?.

"uinuer Ul .....u-.ccb,.,,,,, lt nan supply to the war department. The success of this experiment has lifted the board for vocational educa tion into the position of a recognized part of the government war ma chinery. Secretary of War Baker has written a letter to the heads of all his department telling them that this board is the departme t to which they should refer their problems in the matter of trained men. And almost every department has such problems. The quartermaster's corps for ex ample, needs men trained in fifty dif ferent trades. Of course, men trained in all of these trades are found among the conscripts: but they are not found in the proportions needed. There are too many clerks for examplp, and not enough cooks. Only by training men can the needs of the quartermaster's corps be filled. Hence it is more than probable that evening classes for drafted men in a great many trades will soon be held in all "the principal cities of the country. There will, of course, be nothing compulsory about these classes. Eut ths drafted man who chooses to learn a trade will get more pay. and have a more interest ing and important share in the work of war. Thus a radio operator, in stead of setting". ..rty dollars a month as does an ordinary private, receives from fifty-one to eighty-one dollars a month. He takes part in the inter esting and difficult task of keeping the armv in communication with Its base. He Is not, however, relegated to a safe place behind the lines. Jn stringing the wires which cormect ad vanced positions with the base of operations, he gets all the thrills and danger that the most dariag could crave. Ships Will Win the 'rVar. One of the latest branches of the war machine to apply to the vocation al board for help was the shipping board. Everyone knows that "ships will win the war, and the trouble that we are having in getting them built. Now that the difficulty of de ciding who is to supervise the job has been settled, there comes up the even more distressing problem of who is go ing to do it. In a word, the shipping board cannot get the labor it needs. It is in special need of ship-riveters. There are lota of riveters in the coun try who have been trained in riveting the structural iron used in large build- ings but the Btructural work requires different methnrf nf rivPtin? from a different method of riveting from that used in building ships, and this difference of method means that structural riveters cannot generally be put on ship work without some special training. The vocational board has tackled this problem by putting into t:ie rieid an age..t who is to gamer all possible data. He will find out how many riveters trained in building work are available, and what additional training they will require to make them useful in ship-building. Then the board will proceed to the organ ization of schools where the training can be applied. The dralted man who wants to serve his country in a trained capacity should keep in touch with the super intendent of evening schools in hiB city, or in the large city nearest his home. Even tho no course may be offered which seems to fit his apti tudes. ench a course may be offered before he is called This is his op portunity to learn something out of wav besides the art of killing, to serve with his brain as well as his body. Questions on the above or any sub ject upon whish the reader desires in formation, should be addressed the Topeka State Journal Information Bu reau, Frederic J. Haskin, Director, Washington, D.

TIAVELIETTE BY MK.SAH. j - EVENING STOOT - T ' " Something to Her Advantage. (By Hilda Morris.) Back In Stanton old Ellia Stevens' bookshop was a famous place, for friendly gatherings and gossip. Its hospitable table full of magazines, its big base-burner with a fire glimmer ing red thru the mica windows, its well-lined shelves, and case full of fascinating displays of paper, pen! and other literary appliances made it a popular place for evening gather ings. Toung Ellis had been brought up in that bookshop; he loved the very sight and touch of a book. So when ambition drove him to the city with a little capital it was natural that he should start a bookshop of his own. This was a modest place at first, but it grew rapidly, as some shops have a way of doing. There was no baseburner .in young Ellis store, but therp was a warmth of courtesy and the sort of hospitality which leaves one free to browse among the shelves undisturbed. People loved to drop in and scan the contents of the latest magazines. If they had pencils or writing paper to purchase Stevens's store was the very pleasantest place to go for them, because one could spend a half-hour or so among the latest books for the price of a very small purchase or even for nothing at all, if one chose. There was one young girl who came Into the shop rather often. Ellis had noticed her once or twice she seemed to be always reading magazines, tho she seldom bought more than a pen or an eraser. She was a pretty young thing, with bright color and simple clothes which lacked the' city instinct for "style." She looked like a girl from the country. Ellis Stevens, watching her . on a particular morn ing when there were few other cus tomers, felt a growing conviction that he had seen that girl before, some where. There was something about the turn of her head and the springy way she walked he was sure he had seen her before. Why, even her smile 'was familiar, and her voice when she thanked him for the change from her small purchase. He stared alter her as she left the shop. Where had he known that girl? In Stanton? It was possible. ' All through the busy day that fol lowed, Ellis kept wondering. He could not forget the girl her rosy face kept re-appearing in his mind's eye, laugh ing, tantalizing, as if teasing him to "Guess who! The girl did not reappear that day however, anTl Ellis made a discovery. She had forgotten something. On the counter near where she had stood lay a book, a well-thumbed copy of Pen dennis. And on its fly-leaf was writ ten "Rose Maxwell, Stanton, New York. " Rose Maxwell! He remem bered now. She was one of the in numerable Maxwell family who lived in the old gray farmhouse out on the Greenville road. . He had seen her in school, perhaps, or at the church af fairs. Or it was possible that he had seen her sisters, there were so many of the pretty Maxwell girls, and It was the family resemblanee which had puzzled him. At any rate he wanted to see her again not the sisters, but this particular Rose with the merry, country-tinted face. She would come back for tfte book, of couse. But the weeks went by and Rose Maxwell did not return to the chop. It Ws strange she had been , in- thu habit of dropping in every day or so, before. ' Ellis wondered whether she were ill or whether she had left the city. He searched the directory, but there was no Rose Maxwell. He even made tentative inquiries among the other habitues, but none of them had ever noticed the girl. The city had swallowed upvRose Maxwell. A month or so later Ellis made a flying visit to Stanton, and there he learned that Rose Maxwell had not returned home. She was writing short stories, it seemed; one of her produc tions was in last month's "Spectrum." Ellis got her address from friends without any trouble, and hurried back to town. He meant to find Rose Max well of course it was his duty to re turn that book. So the following Sunday Ellis Stev ens, carrying "Pendennis," called at Rose Maxwell's boarding house. An incongruous landlady met him at the brownstone entrance Miss Maxweli had moved. No, she didn't know her present address. No, she couldn't give him any idea as to where to find her; she had moved some weeks ago. Disconsolately Ellis went home, and depositing the copy of ' Pendennis" on his study table, he sat regarding it mournfully. He might advertise. That was something he had not thought of before. To be sure, he would adver tise! So the following morning this notice appeared in the columns 'of a daily paper: "If the young lady who left a copy of 'Pendennis' in Stevens's book store at Eighty-third street will come to claim her property she will learn of something to her advantage." It was rather a remafttable adver tisement, but it brought results. Ellis waited anxiously ail day, and a num ber of customers thought him ab stracted and a little less courteous than usual, bu1- he could not help watching the doorwsy. And at length, late in the afternoon, Hose Maxwell cams. Ellis was busy with an old gentleman who was fussily purchas ing an edition of the English poets. : and it was some time before he could speak to Rose. But she did not seem to notice. She went directly to the magazine counter and began to read, ss usual. It was Just as if she had never been away from the shop. After an interminable while the old gentleman departed, and Ellis ap proached the girl. She was still read ing, but she looked up with a smile. Ellis thought she was pale and a little thinner. Perhaps she had been ill, after all. "Was It you who advertised my 'Pendennis'?' she asked. "It was I who left it here, jmveral weeks ago." ' "I know it was," he answered. "I thought yu would come back after it. I waited and waited before I ad vertised because " "Because V she repeated curiously. "Because I thought I'd find you. Miss Rose Maxwell. Tou see I knew yoo that is I remembered seeing you in Stanton, and I tried all sorts of ways to find you. I looked in the directory. Why. I even went back home to Stanton to find your address but I found you'd noved." She was looking at him curiously, her eyes wide. ' "But why should you take so much trouble?" she asked. "The book is of no value." "No but Well. I wanted to see you. l had to see you again. Don't you She looked down, her face flushed, and stroked the edge of the counter. "Not exactly." she said. "Why I I Tou little Rose Max well, I love you! Don't you see? I had to see you again and tell you so. whether you could care or not. 1 

WILL UNCLE HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN 'EM OUT FOR HIM? ? loved you from the first minute you set foot in my shop!" She looked up, starry-eyed. "That's why you advertised 'some thin? to my advantage' ? ' she asked. "Yes that was conceited of me. I didn't mean to be conceited. But if you could care a little. Rose, I could make you so happy!" "You dear okl goose!" she ex claimed. "I've cared all the time! Haven't you ever guessed that I left that book here on purpose to make you remember me? 2 meant to come back for it, only I was ill, and so But I've waited and waited and I thought you were never going to ad vertise! I guess it ie Wmethin? to my advantage." Copyright, 1917, by the McClure Newspaper Syndicate.)

"Never mind; tho'll do as waell," answered the man, and the assistant began to measure him.
