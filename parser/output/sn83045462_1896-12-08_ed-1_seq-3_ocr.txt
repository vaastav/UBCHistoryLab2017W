POICY Views Expressed by Editors of the English Newspapers. M ANY OPINION S Prom the Baltimore Sun. President Cleveland's inessage to Con gress deserves to rank with the best of his state papers. Of the lariff, the financial issue and the "trusts," three subjects which are of the gravest importance to the peo ple of the United States, he speaks with his accustomed vigor and clearness, while in regard to the Cuban insurrection his language is guarded, but none the less direct in its bearing upon the unhappy con ditions prevailing in the island. From the Baltimore American. The position assumed by the President toward Cuba will be unsatisfactory, we im agine, to all parties, no matter what may be their attitude. He gives every reason why action should be taken by the United States to put an end to the war, and con cludes by advising that nothing be done, but that if the conflict is not brought to an end at some indefinite period in the future. Spain ought to guarantee autonomy to the Cubans, and the United States aught to guarantee Spain. From tiw Philadelphia Prem. The most notable jeature of the message is the discussion of the Cuban complica tion. On the whole, his deliverance will be regarded as temperate, conservative and restrained, and his attitude will be accepted as the only one compatible with his ante cedents and situation. It is plain that he seeks to hold the balance with an impartial hand, and if this attitude is not altogether a success It is because truth and humanity do not permit complete neutrality. From the Philadelphia Eening Telegraph. The President discusses the Cuban ques tion at length, but while manifesting ap parent sympathy for the struggling patriots of a desolated island, he can find no way in which to aid them. Various more or less polite and suggestive propositions have been made to the baffled government at Madrid, but all to no purpose, and it is con eluded that all hands must stand off a little while longer and see the dreadful butchery go on. From the Philadelphia Times. With reference to national finance and the currency, it may be suffcient to say that the views which Mr. Cleveland has so often expressed are here repeated with un diminished conviction and force. These recommendations are all entirely sound, and though they may not be acted upon by the Congress to which they are addressed. there can be little doubt that the general principles of sound finance and of sound government which the President has con stantly maintained must ultimately gain acceptance. From the Philadelphia Inquirer. It is somewhat Interesting, if not Import ait, to observe that the President indirect ly acknowledges the supremacy of the United States government over that of the individual states. In one portion of his message he uses the expression "the United States has." After this he can hardly be held as a good democrat by those old timers who advocate the rights of states as paramount. A dyed-in-the-wool democrat will always say "the United States have." From the Philadelphia Public Ledger. Whatever expectation his countrymen way have indulged that President Cleve land would, in his last annual message, make a startling or sensational deliver ance in respect of our relations with any fcreign power, especially with regard to thcse growing out of the Spanish-Cuban revolution, has not been advisedly enter tained, as the text of the message itself n w makes manifest. With the President's views of possible future action, it is not likely that either Spain or the insurgents will be satisfied. They are too definite to please the former and too indefinite to grat ify the latter, and yet they are in accord ance with our obligations as one of the family of nations, and evince neither lack of sympathy with the revolutionists fight ing for Independence nor due regard for the obligations of international comity and the country's dignity. The President's posi tion is one which is likely to be sustained by the best thought of the country. From the New York Sun. The last annual message which Mr. Cleveland will ever write as President adds little to the public knowledge concerning any of the great questions that affect this country in its exterior relations or its do mestic policy. The only political value of the document is in its incidental disclosures of Mr. Cleveland's frame of mind as indi cating his probable course during the brief period of power remaining to him. In this way, the message is very signifi et nt. For while one important subject af ter another is taken up and discussed with a show of candor and a directness of ex pression seldom found in Mr. Cleveland's official writings, the conclusion is in every case the same: Postponement of decisive action until after the 4th of next March, which is postponement till the Greek kal er.ds, so far as the Cleveland administra tion is concerned. From the kew York World. This optimistic estimate of Spain's good faith is unfortunately contradicted by the facts of history, At the end of the ten years' war the Cubans took the view which the President now takes. They laid down their arms upon Spain's solemn promise to give them actual autonomy, with represen tation at Madrid. In fact, Spain gave them nothing of the kind. It made a pretense of keeping the promise to the ear, but Inso lently broke it to the hope. So far from having "no reason for assuming" that Spain will not honestly fulfill any promises she may make to the Cubans, we have no reason for assuming or even for expecting anything else, and the President himself seems to share this view when he suggests a United States guarantee of any promises Spain may make. From the New York Times. By far the most important part of the President's message relates to the Cuban question, and the treatment of that is in all respects worthy. Mr. Cleveland makes a singularly clear statement of the present situation and of the course of events that has produced it. The President evades none of the difficulties of the question, and dismisses none of the problems presented with an arbitrary declaration that nothing can be done about it. F'rom the New York Journal. The space which President Cleveland de votes to the reciprocal interests of Cuba, Spain and the United States in his last an nual message to Congress indicates that he is not wholly insensible to the agitation of the question which has long progressed in this country. But his conclusions show beyond a doubt that he will leave to his successor the honor of taking the first step to assure Cuban liberty. From the New York Herald, To the jingoes who clamor for immediate intervention, even at the cost of a war with Spain. and n'ake confident prophenies as to its result, Mr. Cleveland adminis era a dignified rebuke by refusing to enter tain their forecasts and declaring that "the United States his a character to mamntam as a nation which plainly dictates that right and not might should be the rule of its conduct." The portion of Mr. Cleve land's message relating to the situation in Turkey and the Armenian question is in the main a commendable diplomatic effort, The conclusions arrived at are correct, but the historical premises are unstable. From the New York Tr~ae. The President betrays in his closing mes sage the radical defect which has wrecked his party. He is not able to respect andi obey a decision of the people against his ideas. It was the golden hour for him to declare, as Bourke Cockran declared, that those to whom the people had intrusted the work of deaingr with the tariff, the cur

It was Mr. Cleveland's way to reiterate his own 'nethods. LONDON PAPER COMMENTS. What the Dailies Say of the Presi dent's Message. All of the London morning newspapers have editorials on President Cleveland's message. Most of them regard the mes sage as one of rather minor Importance, except so far as It concerns the Cuban question, to which phase the bulk of the comment 'In devoted. The Daily News, the liberal organ, says of the Cuban portion of the mess'Age: -I "President Cleveland's argament is clear enough that no country possesses the right i to foster a perpetual source of trouble, and that Spain must either grant autenomy or sell. Spain, however, will probably re fuse to do anything of the kind. Her pro verbial pride will be much hurt hy Amer Ica's interference. She will be disposed to Insist upon her right to wallop her own niggers as long as she pleases, and Eu rope being very sensitive just now on the subject of the Monroe doctrine, Spain Will probably be Influentially supported if sne holds out. We hope she will not prevail, because autonomy is best for Cuba and best for Spain." The editorial In the Times says: "The tone and spirit of the message are worthy of all praise. It is a pity that the moderation and banance of mind which ar. Cleveland has just displayed were rnot more conspicuous last year, when he startled two continents by a menace Of war. If the Venezuelan ques'.in had been handled as Mr. Ceveland now prandles the Cuban question, he migsht have averted the disruption of the democra y and have kept Bryan and lryanism in their previous obscurity. "The present message ives the sound est advice in the most hnexentional ln guage, nor can the least complaint be made of the character of the warning ad dressed to Spain. It is not Improbable that Spain will take offense, but clearly Mr. Cleveland o actuated by friendly feelings, and Spain will do well to acquiesce. Other wise, the way will be clear for the iflu ence represented by Mr. Call's resolution in the Senate yesterday. If Spam closed rw with Mr. Cleveland's overtures, it would be difficult for the McKinley admenostra tion to steer a new course." The Chronicle (liberal), in common with other papers, congratulates hotn countries on the prospect of the adoption of a gen eral arbitration treaty. It says: "It Is clear that the Clevelan admin Istration means to conclude this great re form before Nesgntng fibera." gnsy of the poe Cuban sftettment the Chreiden Clvladsyrs:n s la "enbeevgh thatmehastr passses then righ touostrn pesretsuwal oucepoftrouble sond that pacing mstanihe ofrcant :urtheom eveba nomideall Thee muc noumitakehowr ica's inotererneSe nngPiden dipoede toensihon er awreht thelo erownti gversmn as logas moe pasific and con rvatpe invr tsfeiignu ow ohar the pobably eubicngovnmntilysts lifelyt hlemma ut she hould she fillt heUnied Stes for Spwnyfuor. ieeoe he edoriasel Cubah quimeskys:u eol "enonfrend si of the iesae who worthld als phe. otbuy Cua."t ha h modatSpin ad blance fccepthi Mr. ee more' coniedycuouslas yer.
