SATURDAY. . . .jj&&wtt7rS3rJt The republican ticket will be elected to a man. The nominees are worthily ip titled to the support of the people, democrats and republicans alike. One ind all are identified with the welfare of the city and will work zealously for ita letterment. Mr. Schumacher for coun-cilman-at-large, Judge Meyer for recor der, C T, Nutter for councilman of the second ward, and are a galaxy of nominees that will make fitting representatives f the city of Tucson. They are deserv ing of the respect and confidence of the 2eople and will be elected. It is fair to assume that the election cf Speaker Crisp will be bui the be ginning of new troubles for the demo crats. There will be half a dozen claim ants for every chairmanship of a promi nent committee and the disappointed men will be apt to be heard from on the floor of the house, and when the "get. ting even process is started the repub. licans of the house are cot likely to re tard it any. Besides, the speaker will Lave the impossible task of satisfying the various outside elements that have contributed, directly or indirectly, to his election. That the house will be an un ruly body is certain. Proofs that the alliance movement in the south will not antagonize the democratic party ar constantly turning tip. The latest is the withdrawl of the Alliance candidate for the vacancy in the Eighth Virginia Congressional dis trict caused by the- death of the late Representative Lee. This withdrawal was made after all arrangements had been made to make an aggressive can vass of the district, with the assistance of the alliance contingent ia congress, and the only reason therefore is that the republicans of the district have nominated a candidate. The Alliance people, although claiming to have been snubbed and insulted by the democrats, will swallow their grievances rather than take any chance of the election of a republican. Crisp, of New Yerk, has been elected speaker of the house by one vote. Small as it may 6eem, that one vote was full of portent to Cleveland. In that one vote his chances for the democratic nomination in 1392, for the presidency went glimmering . Crisp is the Tamma ny nominee, and was supported by Hill and the entire Gorman contingency. Mills on the other hand represented the Cleveland faction of the New York de mocracy. The election of Crisp is a virtual tender of the presidential nomi nation to Hill by the Tammany democ racy, and as the Tammany democracy of New York virtually controls the dem ocratic party in the United States in national politics, Hill can begin to plume his feathers for the race. He, however, will be the easiest man to beat that the democrats can put up. The hearing of the arguments by the supreme court in the three cases brought for the purpose of breaking down the McKinley tariff law, which took place last week, was not calculated to encour age the gentlemen whs have been per suaded to furnish the money to hire the high-priced lawyers. One of these suits is brought on the ground that the omission of the tobacco rebate clause from the bill as signed by theJPresident, makes the whole bill void; another that the sugar bounty clause was unconsti tutional, and the other that the reci procity clause is unconstitutional. For convenience the three cases were heard as one, and if there was any doubt of what the final decision will be it was almost entirely dissipated by the tenor of the questions put by the justices dur ing the argument to the lawyers. The constitutionality of the law was ably maintained by Attorney-General Miller and Solicitor-General Taft. A press telegram from Flagstaff says: G. K. Gilbert and Marcus Baker, the former chief 'geologist of the United States survey, with a force of men have returned from Canyon Diablo, where they were sent by the government to take observations and make a map of the region where so much metoric iron has .recently been found. They spent sixteen days investigating the mammoth hole in the ground supposed to have been made by a meteor. This hole is C25 feet deep and two and one-eighth miles in circumference. The theory is that from the-appearance of the walls and the fact that they have found many pieces) of metoric iron around the hole the meteor penetrated the earth to a depth of 700 or 800 feet before it explod ed, and this accounts for the strange phenomena. Three pieces of the me teor, weighing 300, COO and J850 pounds, respectively, were found on the mesa within two miles ef the crater, and are now in the Smithsonion Institute. Be sides these they found many piecss weighing from two ounces upward. Secretary of the Interior Noble, in his report just issued, says on the sub ject of the reservation of reservoir sites and canals for irrigating: "Under the act of March H, 1S91, providing for desert land entries there have teen al ready filed maps of location for sixty one reservoirs and forty-six canals, the canals and ditches being G31.53 miles in length. The states and territories may be expected to exercise under the reserva tion of authority expressed in the above statute some control &f these compacie6 and protect their citizens from oppress ion, but the United States government, from whom these vastly important ano far-reaching privileges emanate, should not release altogether its hold upon the water supply and its ultimate distribu tion. No one can now compute the money value that will concentrate in these reservoirs and canals, and ditches conveying the water to the fields of the husbandmen, end upon which the peo ple must depend for their prosperity. The efficiency of local legislation may be impaired by priyate interests, and few may be enriched at the expense of the many." When the Honorable Secretary jenred the foregoing be evidently had in mind the water clause in Arizona's new constitution, or to say the least, kindred instruments that have the interests of the farmers Et the mercy of those own- : ingand controlling the water upon which ' fiot only their prosperity but their very existence depends. Such has been and is oar interpretation of that famous clause. Mbdj agriculturalists, however, think differently. We hope they are correct in their views.

The Scientific American, published by Munn & Co., New York, during for. ty five yerrs, is, beyond all question, the leading paper relating ta science, me chanics and inventions published on this continent. Each weekly issue pre. sents the latest scientific topics in an in teresting and lively manner, accompan ied with engravings prepared expressly to demonstrate the subjects. The Sci entific American is invaluable to every person desiring to (keep pace with the inventions and discoveries of the day. The freshness of the "we" local editor of the Star is amusing. His greenness at the work is apparent in every line. The "we" of the local page overshadows the whole paper and bends the editorial tripod out of shape. The belief that Editor Hughes, during his presence abroad in Florence, hai left his little son Johnny at the wheel, has been dis eipated by the receipt of a complimen tary copy of the Freehold Icetitute Mag azine, from Master John at Freehold, New Jersey, which exonerates him from the soft impeachment. We would suggest, however, to the embrjotic "we," whoever he may be, that he confine himself to the truth and to win if it be possible the envied name of being a reh able newspaper man. The reading public have long since passed the gullibility of youth and prefer truth and reliability to the freshness of a fanciful imagina tion. Thk democrat 3ditor of the Star's local-political column is a young man who allows his enthusiasm and freshness in politics to get away with his discre tion. The railroad men won't thank this half fledged democratic editor for presuming on their ignorance to the ex tent that the following article implies; We do not agree with the republi cans, as expressed by Judge Wright and the Citizen that no man should be allowed to vote unless he pays taxes. We believe that every American citizen should have the right to cast his ballot. This is a direct strike at the railroad boy6, and we rise to 6ay that the rail road men have as much sense as some of our leading republicans have, and they may be 6ome of our principal tax payers tomorrow. For that reason alone they should have the right to vote. Such weaklings are nauseating and don't catch any votes for the Demo cratic ticket, To the contrary they disgust the intelligent voters working in the railroad shops and on the road. Republicans don't disfranchise voters. That is a peculiar invention of demo crats on which they claim a patent right and to sing such a tune to any class of men is to advise them that the audience is supposed to be gullible. The demo cratic manipulator of the locals in the Star will find out that vates cannot be diverted from the republican ticket that way. Until the whole of President Harri son's message has been made public through the press of the country a true estimate o! ita comprehensiveness can. not be arrived at. Judging by the frag mentary portion which reached us yes terday, his message is the work of a mas ter mind, and as such will impress the people of the great country of which he is its honored chief magistrate. We, however, sincerely regret the position he has taken on the silver question, as the free coinage of the white metal would bring prosperity and plenty to the silver producing states of the west. A silver dollar should be worth as much as a gold dollar in any market in the world and none can ever claim that the' free coinage of gold has wrought disaster to any country or people, Silver estab lished on a like basis with a fixed valua tion, and coined as produced, would make the western states and territories smile with abundance, and their hills re sound with the busy hum of commerce and tiade,but with gold predominant and the coinage of silver hedged in by restrictive laws and subject to a fluctu ating market, dominated by the money lenders of Wall street, our silver mines mu6tlie in enforced idleness and the West be compelled to dance attendance on the money markets of the east. This we regret exceedingly. The president's views on th question of water and wa ter storage, will meet with the unquali fied approval of nearly every thinking man in the states and territories affect ed. That the rights of the water should be vested in the people and not in cor porations has been also ably held bj Hon. Secretary Noble in his annual re port recently made public. It wa3 up. on this 6ame ground t he Citizen op. posed the adoption of the constitution We believed then, and we do now, that the water clause was inimical to the rights of the peop e and we are pleased to know that the powers that be are of a like way of thinking. We do not in terpret President Harrison's message as beiDg opposed to statehood, 4but to the contrary we believe that he will hearken to the will of the people and favor the admission of Arizona as a state at an early day. The obnoxious water clause can be eliminated from her constitution and the' rights vested in the people where it of right belongs. Arizona wearing the garb and star of statehood, and privileged to work her silver mines under an unlimited coinage ic v ul '. be the booming country of the world. Specimen Cases S. H.

Crisp was nom inated speaker of the on the 30th ballot. The 22d ballot was destined to mark the first significant change of the day, Cable and Newberry abandoning Springer, and voting for Mills. During the succeeding ballots the excitement was intense. Shiveley had notified Cable and Newberry that whenever they de serted Springer for Mills, he and his friends would vote for Crisp. This threat was carried out, Shiveriy and Stout changing to Crisp. Cobb and Dearman then left Hatch and voted for Mills Im mediately there was the wildest excite ment. Catchmgs and others of Crisp's forces rushed from the hall ind into the headquarters of Hatch. There was a brief conference,and Catchinge returned, followed by Hatch, who voted for Crisp, and Byrnes and Wilson of his 6tate f ol io wed his lead. This gave Crisp a lead of 5 votes, the 23rd ballot resulting Crisp 100, Mills 90, MoMillan 19, Spring er 13, and Stevens L On the 24th ballot, Springer lost another vote to Crisp. This was the only change, but it gave Crisp a lead of six over Mills. The 25th, 26th and 27th ballots failed to show any change. Then recess was taken until 8 p. m.

' ' ' ' Washington, D. U. Dec. 9. Ab stracts of the president's message say Washington, Deo. 9, To The Bin ate and House of Representatives: Reports of the heads of several execu tive departments which are hereby transmitted, and reports of the secretary of the ; treasury and attorney general made direct to congress to furnih complete review of the administration work of the last fiscal year, relating to internal affairs. The president then recommends careful perusal of reports by all mem bers of congress and continues: The work of the state department dur ing last year has been characterized by an unusually large number of impor tant negotiations and by diplomatic re suits of-a notably and highly beneficial character. Among these are reciprocal treaty ar rangements which have been concluded in the exercise of powers conferred on me by section 3 cf tariff law, with the republic cf Brazil, with Spain, for the West Indies possessions and with San Domingo. Negotiations with other countries have been much advanced, and it is hoped that before the close of the year further effective trade arrange ments of great value will be concluded The president then discusses the Bering sea question steps in negotiations with Great Britain, and concludes by stat ing that a satisfactory basis of arbitra tion has been reached. The president recommends that pro. visions be made for joint demarcation of the boundary between Canada and the United States when required by in. creasing border settlements, especiallyjin straits and rivers. He regrets that the United States has been unable to bring about a settlement of the boundary dis pute between Venezula and Great Britain, since the passage of the wheat inspection law by the last congress Germany, Denmark, Austria and France have 'opened their ports to inspected American pork. The president adds Outlines of an agreement has been reached with Germany looking to equit able trade concessions in consideration of continued free importation of her sugars, but the time has not yet arrived when this correspondence can be sub mitted to congress. The president refers briefly to the re cent troubles in Brazil, Baying that peace has been re-established without blood shed. xne lyncning at xsew urieans in March last, sajB the message, of eleven men or Italian nativity by a mob of citi zens, v as a most deplorable and dis creditable act. It did not, however. have its origin in any general animosity to the Italian people, nor in any disre spect to the government of Italy, with which our relations were of the most friendly character. The fury of the mob wan directed against these men as supposed participants or accessories in the murder of city officers. I do not allude to this as mitigating in any de gree by this offiGe against the law of humanity, only as international ques tions that grew out of it It was repre sented by the Italian minister that sev eral of those whose lives had been taken by the mob were Italian subjects, and demand was made for punishment of participants and indemnity to the fami lies or those killed. It was to be re gretted that the manner in which these claims were presented was not such aa to promote a calm discussion of the questions involved, but this may well be attributed to excitement in which the nativity evoked. The views of this gov eminent were iuny stated in corre spondence, as well as its purpose to make investigation with views to deter mine whether there were present any circumstances that could under such rules of duty as e Lad indicated create obligation upon the United States. The temporary absence of a minister plenipotentiary at this capital has re. tarded further correspondence, but it is not doubted that friendly conclusion is attainable. The president suggests that congress should make treaty rights of foreigners cognizable in United States courts, and states as his opinion that when this is done the government should hold itself responsible for the acts of state officials in such cases as it would le responsible if congress had ' passed such law. in regard to chile. Referring to Chile the president said "The civil war in Chile, which began in January last, was continued, but fortu nately with infrequent and net import ant armed commissions until August, when the congressional forces landed near Valparaiso, and after a bloody en gagement captured the city. President Balmaceda at once recognized that his cause was lost, and a provisional gov eminent was speedily established by the victorious party. Our minister was promptly directed to recognize this gov ernment as soon as it should have stablished defects of character, which was done. During this civil contest frequent indirect appeals were made to this gov ernment to extend belligerent rights to the insurgents and give audience to their representatives. This was refused, and that policy pursued throughout. upon which this government when wrenched by civil war, so strenously insisted on the part of European nations. the itata matter. A Chiloan armed vessel, commanded by naval officers of an insurgent fleet, manned by its sailors and with soldiers oa board, was seized under process of the United States court at San Diego, California, for violating neu trality laws, and the whole placed in custody of an officer. It was forcibly wrested from his control and put to sea. It would have been incon sistent with the dignity ard self respect of this government not to have insisted that the Itata should be returned to San Diego, to abide the judgment of the court. This was so clear to the junta that before the arrival of the Itata at Iquique the secretary of foreign rela tions of the prcvieional government ad dressed Rear Admiral Brown, command ng the United States naval force in a communication, of which the following s an extract: "The provisional government has earned by cablegram of the Associated Press that the transport Itata detained at San Diego by order of the United States for taking on board mu nitions of war and in possession of a marshal, left for San Diego, carrying off the official who was landed at or near the point on the ccast. "If this report is correct this govern ment would deplore the conduct of, the itata and in evidence it is not disposed to support or agree to any in fraction of the laws of the United States. The un ders gned declares to you as soon as she is within reach of orders we will place the Itata with the arms and am. munition she took in at San Diego at the disposition of the United States." The trial in the district court of Cali fornia has recently resulted in a decis ion holding among other things in the decision that as the congressional party had not been recognised as belligerent, the acts done in its interests could not be a violation of the neutrality laws. From this judgment the United States has appealed, not that the con demnation cf th vessel is a matter o importance, but that we may know what law is lor, i tne prefect construction is correct there is an obvious necessity for revision and amendment. The president says further, that dur. ing the Chilean war instructions to our officers and representatives there were to observe strict impartiality and no interference, and he is satisfied their instructions were observed. No official complaint of the conduct of either the minister or naval ofli.era had been made, and he regrets "that 6o many of our own people bad given ear to unoffi cial charges and complaints that mani festly had their origin in rival interests, and with intent to prevent amicable relations with Chile. The president reviews the question of the right of asylum on war ships and in legations, end says that the United States, as well as other nations, has extended this pro tection from motives of humanity lie is not willing to direct the surrender of refugees still in the legation, and so far Chile has not denied this right of asylum, and he thinks she will not do so. The objectionable treatment of our minister, against which we protested, has been stopped. 

BALTIMORE AFFAIR DENOUNCED. The president then says : "On Octo ber 16, an event occurred in Valparaiso so serious and tragic in its circumstances and results as to justly excite the indig nation of our people, and to call for prompt and decided action on the part ol lb. s government. A considerable number of the sailors of the United States steamship Balti more, then in Valparaiso harbor, being on shore leave, and while unarmed.were assaulted by armed men. nearly simul taneously in different locations in the city. One petty officer was. killed out ngnt ana seven or eight more were seriously wounded, one of whom has since died. So savage and brutal was the bssault that several of our sailors received that more than one has as many as eight stubs and wounds. Investiga tion of the matter was promptly made by the board ot omcers of the Baltimore, aud their reports show the assault was unprovoked, and that our men wore conducting themselves in a peaceable and orderly' manner, and that some police of the city took part in the assault and used their weapons with fatal effect, while a lew otherB and some well dis posed citizens endeavored to protect our men. Thirty-six of our sailors while being taken to prison were cruelly beaten and maltreated. The fact that they were discharged without any crim inal charge being lodged against any one ot them shows very clearly that they were innocent of breach of peace, o lar as 1 have yet been able to learn no explanation of this bloody work has been suggested other than it originated in hostility to these men as sailors of the United States wearing the uniform of the government and not to any personal hostility. The attention of the Chilean government was at once called to this affair and a statement of facts obtained by our investigation was sub mitted, accompanied by the request to be advised of any qualifying facts in possession of the Chilean government that might relieve the affair of the ap pearance of insult of this government and if such qualifying facts did not ex ist this government would confidently expect full and prompt reparation. "It is to be regretted that the reply of secretary ot foreign affairs of the pro visional government was couched in an offensive tone. To this no response has been made. J he government is now awaiting the result of the criminal court at Valparaiso. "If expectations should be disappointed or if further needless delay intervenes I shall by special message bring the matter again to the attention of con gress for such action as may be neces sary. The entire correspondence with the government of Chile will be sub mitted to congress at an early day." 

M'KINLET BILL. QGeneral interest in operations of the treasury department has become aug mented during the past year by reason of conflicting predictions irbich accompan ied and followed the tariff and other leg lslation of lfist congress. Affecting revenues on hand it was contended that imports would so fall off aa to leave the treasury bankrupt and that prices of articles entering into the living ,of people would be so en hanced as to disastrously affect their comfort and happiness, while on the other hand it was argued that the loss to revenue would largely result in gain to the people; that prices of necessaries of life including those most higblv pro tected would not be enhanced, and that labor would have a larger market and products of the farmer would advance while the treasury surplus and receipts would be adequate to meet the appro priation. It is not my purpose to enter at any length into discussion of eliects of this legislation, to which I have re. ferred. but a brief examination of statis tics of the treasury and a general glance at the state of business through out the country will, I think, satisfy the impartial inquirier that its results have disappointed the evil purposes of its opponents and in a large measure the honelul predictions of its friends. Rarely, if ever, in the history of our country has there been a time when pro ceedsof one day'tt labor or the products of one farmer's crops could purchase such a large amount of things that enter into the living of the masses of the people. I believe that a full test will develop the fact that the tariff act of the Cf ty-first congress is very fav orable in its average effect upon the prices of articles entering with common use. The president quotes statistics show ing 1 hat during the past year both ex ports and imports were greater than for any previous year, and that there is cer tainly nothing in the condition of trade, foreign or domestic, and nothing in the condition of our people, to suggest that the existing tariff and revenue legisla. tion bears oppressively upon the people. Change in tariff and financial legisla tion cannot help but may seriously im pede business, to the prosperity of which some degree of stability in legislation is essential for I think.there arejconclusive evidence that the new tariff has created several great industries which will with, in a few years give employment to sev eral hundred thousand American work ing men and women. 

KILLS ARIZONA 8 INFAMOUS WATER CLAUSE The president says the prosperity of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah are largely dependant on "irrigation water supply and that if the matter is much longer neglected corporations will ave unrestricted control of the water and the cultivation of the land be reduced to tenants at will. The government should not part with its ownership of water sources except on uouditions of servirg water to settlers at reasonable rates. Granting of franchises of enormous value to state or municipalities is advised against. The president advises against the ad mission of Utah until there is a certain ty that polygamy is dead. 

AGAINST FREE COINAGE. Referring to silver, the president says: The reports of tho secretary of the treasury show the purchase of over forty eight million ounces of silver since Aug. 13, at an average of S19.4o per ounce, lie states that the free silver men believed the last siiver law would make the value of silver dollars a hundred cents, but that at one time ince the passage of the law the dollar was worth only 74 cents. The causes of this were not agreed upon. The usual annual export of eight and a half millions ot silver had changed during the year to an import of two and three-fourth millions. The govern ment now buys and stores annually fifty. four million ounces of silver and some six million more than our whole domestic production available for coin age. The increased circulation thus pro vided was needed and is beneficial. The president recommends that the existing law be given a full trial, and "I am still of the opinion that the free coinage of silver under existing oondi tiers now will seriously affect our business interests at home rvnd abroad." lie believes free coinage would cause a commercial panic, and favors it only when the co operation of other nations can be secured. The sentiment in Eu rope is not such as to render advisable the proposal for such an agreement. In March, 1839, the surplus in the treasury was 8183,000,000, and si nee then 8259,000,000 in bocda have been re. deemed. In March, 1889, the circulation was $1,404,000,000 or 3.03 per capita. Now it is g 1,577,000,000 or 24.38 per capita. The president considers the recent change by Michigan in her method of choosing presidential eiectors as unfor tunate and even threatening, and sug gests a constitutional amendment to prevent its further adoption. The prin cipal objection is that the ordinary method has been proven good for sixty years,- while the new method offers opportunities to gerrymanders. Now the scheme has been ex tended to presidential electorp, and the gerrymander has its grasp on all three branches of government. The constitution guarantees a repub. lican form of government to tho states, which involves no possible equality in votes in the people. He recommends such a constitutional amendment as will secure uniformity and prevent the disgraceful partisan juggling to which the liberty of choice in method of selee. tion of offices is a temptation which is our greatest national danger. He says mere is f.a overinrow or tne majority and control by suppression or perversion of the popular suffrage; thst there is real danger here and all must allow that its energies have been chiefly expended in trying to pit responsibili.y upon the opposite party, rather tbaa in efforts to make such practices impossible by eith er party. "Can we not adjourn that interminable debate while we take 6teps in the direc tion of reform by eliminating the gerry mandering, which has been denounced by all parties as an influence in the election of presidential electors.
