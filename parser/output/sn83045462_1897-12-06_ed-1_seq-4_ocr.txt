The Message. President McKinley's mwsaffe to Con gress, submitted today, is brief and to th^ point. It is conservative and business-like, yet vigorous in tone, and commends itself to thinking citizens as a logical, sensibl^ production. Prime interest naturally centers in what the President has to say on the currency question and on Cuba and Hawaii. The President notes that the full value of the Dii.gley law has not yet been realized but believes that what has already been accomplished by it is assurance of its time liness and wisdom. He then proceeds with out any suggestions of hesitancy or any recognition of difficulties in the way of leg islation that ?lay exist on account of the i present partisan conditions in Congress, to attack the currency problem. He Indicates beyond dispute the need of a revision of the financial system, describing the present dangers and embarrassments and urging that the time to remedy the existing ? vils is now. when the government is free from serious troubles. The only premise put forth as a condition antecedent to currency re form is that the government should enjoy a revenue equal to all Its liabilities. With that assured the President urges that steps be taken to prevent the process formerly called the "endless chain" of redemption, bringing necessities for bond issues and serving as a constant irritant to the gov ernment in its financial operations. The President's plan for curing this con tinual dram upon the gold reserve Is to hold all notes that may be redeemed In gold and to reissue them only whin gold is offered in exchange for them. He sub mits to Congress the recommendations of the Secretary of the Treasury without com ment save in two particulars, looking to the enlargement of the volume of national bank notes in circulation. This process would | be aided by the fulfillment of the Presi dent's desire that additional national banks be established in the rural sections of the country, where there is pressing need of more currency. The President assumes that the Hawaiian annexation treaty will be ratified and ex presses a measure of concern that the suc ceeding legislation should be carefully drawn to prevent hasty assimilation and to ensure a wise form of government for the new territory. He shows a friendly con cern in the welfare of the Nicaragua canal project and indicates that satisfactory prog ress is being made in the establishment of reciprocity with other nations under the Urms of the tariff law. He reviews the scope of the fur-seal conferences and states that all proper and safe proj>ositions look ing to the establishment of a system of gen eral international arbitration will hence forth receive hi3 constant encouragement. Other features of the message deal spe cifically but briefly with departmental mat ters. The President urges, along the line of the recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy, that the naval facilities be in creased to keep pace with recent additions to the navy itself and recommends the con struction of nen dry docks. He strongly concurs in the suggestion of the Secretary of the Treasury that attention be paid to the need of better quarantine regulations in the south and proposes the organization of a national bacteriological commission. The international bimetallc commission is congratulated upon the ability with whi?h it pursued its endeavor to secure an agree ment with the leading nations of fclurope looking to a silver coinage system, and the President says that, notwithstanding the failure of the commission to secure an agreement, "it is to be earnestly hoped that their labors may result in an international ! agreement which will bring about recogni tion of both gold and silver as money upon such terms and with such safeguards as will secure the use of both metals upon a basis which shall work no injustice to any class of our citizens." The President adds a good word for the civil service system and promises that he will endeavor at all times to uphold and ex tend it. He closes his message with a gen eral admonition to Congress to keep the appropriation.^ within the limits of the prob able revenues of the government. The new police regulation which requires all motor carriages and vehicles drawn by dratt animals to display lighten! lamps while in motion between one hour after sunset and one hour before sun rise, on and after the ilrst day of March, next, is one that is likely to provoke opposition, in certain quarters, but it is one that should be fully and rigidly enforced nevertheless. It is a most salutary measure, directly in th*- line of insuring the safety of the public, and all good citizens will second the efforts of the authorities in so good a cause, not alone by observing the regulation them selves. but in seeing that It is observed by others. A spirited debate between Senators Mason and Hoar would greatly enliven the situa tion for people who enjoy contrast. a The President on (aba. Th*- gr.a'er part of the President's mes sage relates to Cuba. No other subject requires so much space for its elaboration ar.l none will attract so much keen atten tion. The substance of all that the Presi dent says is thai it is due to the present government of Spain to permit n to justify is efforts to pacify Cuba and to establish a more generous system of government on the Island. On this basis he offers no rec ommendations looking to immediate action In behalf of the insurgents and lo that extent It is likely that his presentation of the case will disappoint the radical friends of the independence party In the island, who may have hoped for a suggestion of force fiom the executive. The President re views the conditions that have controlled Cuba for many years past and points out the d-rlorable state of affairs that calls for a remedy. He denounces the policy of con centration as "cruel" and asserts that it "failed utterly as a war measure." Indeed, the president warmly insists that "it was not a w :r measure; It was extermination." He proceeds to outline the instructions given to Minister Woodftrd. looking to tne Information of Spain that the I'nlted S'ates felt that the time had come for something definite to be done in Cuba. Tne tone of these instructions was such that there could have been no doubt as to the policy of this government to press Spain to acts, yet the matter api ears to have beep couched in the most diplomatic language. Spain's answer was both conciliatory and irritating. It yielded gracefully to the suggestion of this country's Interest In the welfare of the Island, but the government at Madrid went too (ar when It suggested that the United States had not lived up to Its international obligations In the matter of flUbus-ering. The President properly stamps this assump tion as unfounded and declares with em phtaii that the I'nlted States has done all that could be expected of it to prevent vio latlons of the International bonds that at present tie our hands from extending aid to Cuba. The President outlines four possible rem edies for the situation, as follows: Recogni tion of the insurgents as belligerents; rec ognition of the independence of Cuba; a neutral intervention to end the war by im posing rational compromises between the contestants; intervention in favor of one or the other party. He then go's on to discuss at considers.Die length the propriety and wisdom of a recognition of the belligerency cf the insurgents, quoting President Grant to indicate the inadvlsabillty at this time of extending that recogntion. He further outlines the grave duties tha^ would be imposed upon this country by sucii an act. requiring It to observe to the letter ail the principles that control a neutral state, and he concludes thai this act would redound to the inter.-Ms rather of Spam than of the insurgents. In rejecting this proposal he intimates his strong tendency toward a measure of more practical benelit to the Cubans. The President's conclusion Is that Inas much as the Sagasia ministry has at last given evidence of a desire to instituie gen uine reforms In the island it is the part of discretion for this government to wait a reasonable time to permit the program to justify itself if possible. It Is to be noted that throughout his message the President Intimites that results must be had without long delay, and there are several references to the reservation of the right of the exec utive to act In intervention whenever the best iliierests of humanity demand, it is also noteworthy that the President strong ly deprecates the idea of a forcible i.nnexa tion cf Cuba to this country, insisting tnat it would be "an act of cr m.nal aggression." In con< lusion there appears a note of firm ness and a purpose to keep Spain at all times fully aware of the keen Interest of this government In Cuba's welfare. The President's closing words on this subject con-tain a distinct note of warning to the authorities at Madrid: "if it shall hereafter appear a duty Im posed hv our obligations to ourselves, to civilization anci humanity to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only because the necessities for such action will be so clear as to command the support and aprroval of the civilized world." Prompt CouidFrRllon of the Treaty. Senator Lodge announces that the immi gration bill, which stands at the head of the Senate calendar, will not be pressed to obstruct the Hawaiian annexation treaty. Mr. I^odge Is a friend of both measures, but he recognizes the great importance of the treaty, and he desires to see that dis posed of promptly and without hindrance. His position in the matter is altogether wise. The treaty should be acted on at as early a day as possible. The country is fully advised on the subject, and so Is the Sen ate. The general proposition has been un der discussion in the press and elsewhere for nearly Ave years. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of the treaty. Prompt ratification of the instrument there fore will not only meet this sentiment, but clear the way in the Senate for other meas ures calling for attention. The dispatches report the return to this country of the Japanese minister, who is now en route to Washington from San Francisco with special instructions from his government on the subject of this treaty. He announces that Japan is still opposed to annexation, but he gives no new reasons for that attitude. He speaks of Japan's rights in the islanu's under treaty, and he announces that If these are not respected trouble will follow annexation. That is a useless announcement. The an nexation of th^ islands to the I'nited States comprehends the respecting of all rights real rights?of whatsoever character that now exist. Hut If Japan means that she has purposes of her own with regard to the islands with which annexation will in terfere, then She may not expect serious attention on our part. That admits of no discussion whatever. The CoiuiiiixMionprii' Report. The Commissioners' annual report, pub lished today, contains many important recommendations that should tind embodi ment in the form of legislation at this ses sion of Congress. The projects they urge upon the attention of the houses are all well known and have received full measure of public approval. They all tend to the material betterment of the national capi tal. and the session's grist of local meas ures, if ground upon the basis of this docu ment, will be entirely satisfactory to the citizens of the District. More policemen, better paid firemen, more modern facili ties for conducting the municipal business, a revision of the license laws, the exten sion of the civil service law to the District government, the construction and equip ment of large manual training schools, the extension of the system of street cleaning by hand, the enactment of a law regulating the system of tax sales, the reclamation of the Eastern branch flats, a scientific inves tigation into the character of the water supply, the passage of a law regulating cemeteries, the perfection of the sewer system and the establishment of a more complete system of Inspecting food supplies ?these are some of the projects that the civilian Commissioners bring to the front, in addition to those that have already been recommended by the Engineer Commis sioner. The program is long, and Is yet capable of completion within a brief period if the houses will but listen to the rea sons that lie behind each item. The report is eloquent in its demonstration of the in telligent interest that the Commissioners take in their official duties. <?? ? ? Considering the rather ill temi>ered racket that Is being made over the proposed chris tening jf the battle-ship Kentucky, wouldn't it be the better thing to let the vessel quietly slide into the water, without any ceremony at all? That course would be contrary to usage, on such occasions, we know; but so, too, are these unseemly public displays of causeless feminine tem per a little out of the common. ? As usual, it will be demonstrated that when a President's message Is under dis cussion a great deal depends on the politi cal belief of the critic. It becomes more and more apparent that from a practical standpoint Andree made a great mistuke in not staying at home and lecturing. It is to be assumed that Purls editors who aim at the truth are more successful than they are In aiming at one another. A Sew "Kanlera <laeatl?n." European statesmen are anxiously watch ing the development of the latest phase of the "Eastern Question." Germany's re cent action In China has precipitated a new crisis. Involving the international wel fare of at least six nations. China and Germany, of course, and Russia. France, England and Japan, more or less directly. Under such circumstances It is no wonder that grave Importance attaches to the news that Russia is buying war stores and thut Get many has ordered additional artillery men and marines to the fleet now in Chi nese waters. On the action of China's em peror and of Russia's csar much will de pend. So far as present Information Is Indicative the emperor is indisposed to yield to the excessive demands of Ger many. It remains to be seen whether Rus sia will protest against the aggression. Ir. such a protest she would naturally be Joined by France, who has ? material In terest In i he affair through her posses sions In the south of China. France would at the same time eagerly accept such a chance to participate In a quarrel with her old ?nemy, especially If such a rup ture as she hopes to witness between Rus sia and Germany were the cause. But most important of all is the suggestion new afloat that France has cast longing eyes upon the tsland of Formosa, which was ceded to Japan by China as a result of the late war. Japan has had a hard j time subuuing the Island, which is a veri table hot-bed of rebellion. In fact, about ail that she was granted by China was the privilege of entering Formosa and pacify ing it. This has practically been accom plished, but at such a cost that Japan wuuld never yield possession willingly. To secure Formosa would cost France either | a costly war or an extravagant price. Much depends upon the course Russia decides to take in the case. Her power over China Is now great and will Increase with time, as the transcuntint ntal railway is com pleted and operated. She can but look with jealous eyes upon Germany's securing a foot-1'.old so near the center of her opera tions on the coast. Two courses are now said to be in contemplation?to oppose Germany's demand and to encourage the Emperor of China to insist upon arbitra tion and money adjustments, or to enter into a pact with Germany to partition the desirable points along the coast. To such ail enterprise France would probably be ad mitted as partner. What would Great Brit ain have to ?ay? It is suggested that she might be appeased by the grant of Chinese territory in the vijinily of Hong Kong, without which that port Is really defense less. The situation is full of the gravest possibilities of trouble. The Star's Cuban Correspondence. The second letter from Havana from the pen of Mr. Peiper, The Star's special cor respondent In Cuba, is published today. It gives further details of the conditions that surround the new captain-general in his efforts to carry out the reform plans of the Sagasta government. According to this let ter there is little real progress and little prospect that any material change will soon occur in the state of the island. Mr. Pep per analyzes the efforts that are being made by the military authorities to dis integrate the insurrection by tempting In surgents to lay down their arms, showing that thus far there has been nothing prac tical accomplished in this line. He further shows that the work of relieving the suf ferings of the reconcentrados is progressing but slowly and In some districts the miser able people are worse oft than ever, owing to the incompetence or obstinate neglect of the commanders of provinces and subor dinate officials. ?? Congress is one of the greatest and most praiseworthy attractions this country has produced. It is to be hoped there will be no further attempts by syndicates to gobble. I'nless the prospect for harmony In Tam many politics improves, the turfmen will have to be content for some time to come with winning one another's money. ? ? The issue of paper money will give Gen- ] era! Blanco a tempting opportunity to harass the enemy by complicating its cur- | rency problems. The next time General Weyler has to make a speech the best and most agreeable thing Jie can do is to learn some of Mr. Depew's stories. ? ? ? ? Every man whose business requires book keeping hopes to see reports of this Con gress' proceedings on the right side of his ledger. Bismarck's resentment of American arro gance may be due to the feeling that home Industries ought to be protected.

"I know one man," said the quiet young woman, "who is listened to with respect by both sides whenever he speaks in Con gress." "He must have a lot ol influence!" "I hope he has. He's the chaplain." "Sometimes," said Uncle Eben, "dar wc uldnt' be so much objection to a m^n habbln' his own opinion ef he didn't persist in goin' aroun" an' tryin' t?r gib ebry body else a clear title to It." The Difference. "It Is a great pleasure." said a congress man, as he beamed over the big bunch of flowers on his desk, "to be remembered by one's constituents In this manner." "But you tay you don't pay any attention to sneers." "I don't." "Then why should you not be equally in different to compliments." "Voung man, there Is a great difference. It's a constant temptation to reach for the always convenient brick to throw at a man, whether you really mean it or not. But when you go to tne trouble and ex pense of getting bouquets to throw at him* you are usually pretty much in earnest." December.

From the London, Oct., AtlrertUer. The discussion as to the best method of settling the difficulties between Canada and tl e United States continues. It has been suggested by s-ome that the questions in dispute can be best disposed of by a form of reciprocity. Others have held that each question should be settled by itself. We have learned by experience liot to be tco sanguine as to a speedy settle ment of all questions at issue. But be yond all question, the recent conferences between Sir Wilfrid Baurier and Sir Ixrnis Da vies and members of the United States administration are calculated to have a good effect. The Canadian statesmen have become personally acquainted with the political leaders at Washington, and the general feeling Is that no matter what may come of the negotiations entared on with regard to the seals of the Paciflc ocean, and other matters in dispute, there is a growing disposition toward Interna tional' friendliness. This Is of -.ome ad vantage. It must be borne In mind that the duty of the United States government is to lo6k well after the Interests cf Its people In any settlement that may be >Je vised, just as it Is the duty of our Canadian statesmen to see that no legitlma-.e inter est of the people of the dominion is sacri ficed. While not Inclined to go Into ecstasies over the prospects, we see good evidence that the relations between the two coun tries are Improving.
