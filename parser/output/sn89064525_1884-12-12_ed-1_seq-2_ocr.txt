The Vermont legislature has refused to create a railroad commission with powers and duties similar to those oi the admirably constituted Massachusetts board, and ha3 also rejected a bill to prevent discrimination against "short hauls." The reported plague in Western Vir­ ginia and Eastern Kentucky, resembles cholera and is called cholera by the people. It is propagated- like cholera, through drinking water polluted with its germs. It acts quickly and with most of the symptoms of cholera. That it is sporadic: is true nevertheless it rages Under conditions almost exactly like those which prevail in cholera seasons and districts, except that the scourged reigon is mountiiuous and high above the sea level, and that the cause which first led to the use ef impure water was drouth. Emigrants are pouring into California at the rate of 1500 to 1800 a week. Most of them settle in the southern part of the St_te and engage in fruit and wine growing. Many of the emi­ grants are men of means, who go to the country in se^ch of health and are led fto devote themselves to congenial busi­ ness. The poorer classes go to the northern counties and engage in agri­ cultural pursuits, while about 30 per cent of the whole number push up north to Oregon and Washington Territory. The population of California is now about 1,000,000. The latest reports from many of the leading winter wheat growing states, including Tennessee, Virginia, Ken­ tucky, Maryland, Missouri, Kansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsyl­ vania, all of which excepting the three latter states show a large decrease in area, compared with last year, varying from 10 to 33 1-3 per cent, and in alJ the Southern states the condition is re ported very poor compared with las! year. Ohio, Michigan and Pennsyl­ vania report a slight doorcase in acre­ age and fair condition. These facts are deemed important in their relation tr the prices of wheat next year. The line officers of the army are pre­ paring to make a strong push for legis ation by congress to accelerate promo­ tions, which is now almost stagnant. A bill is to be introduced fixing the age for compulsory retirement at a muct lower figure than sixty-four, as now, and providing that captains shall go on the retired list at the age of fifty. It is thought the passage of such a bilV a„j this is the only possible method ol keeping up the promotion of nged offi­ cers iuto position of usefulness in the army in time of peace. It is not men­ tioned, and therefore deemed out of ths question, to remedy the evil by reduc­ ing the number of cadets of West Point, which is the nursery of army officers. A comparatively slight reduction would keep the chances of promotion, and really the number of officers now in the array is vastly out of proportion to the number of soldiers. The same evil prevails in the Navy, and to a greater exteir:.. President Arthur approves of the rec­ ommendation u( the postmaster-gen­ eral that the unit of weight in the rat­ ing of first class matter should be one ounce instead of one-half ounce, as it now is .He says in view of the statis­ tics furnished by the department it may be well doubted whether the charge would result in any loss of revenue that it would greatly promote the con­ venience of the public is beyond dis­ pute. It is to be hoped that this change will la made. The saving of expense to tlie people would be considerable, and a gpent source of annoyanse avoided. Comj^iarfttively few people possess letter scales, and therefore cannot determine, in a vast number of cases, how much postage is .required. Very frequently, too rnueh postage is paid, to make sure of indtent transmission, and still often er, too little. With a two-cent stamp for one oa-nce,-instead of half an ounce, •s r.ow, there would be no question in regard to thevyaot majority of ordinary letters. People in all'the large cities of the JEast who are aware of ,the low price of wheat are tasted-as much as ever for flaur and bread. This gross injustice «lkits very strong compliments through the aewspapers, and frequent enggestions are found in favor of govern­ ment regulation of .this matter, as in d'lurope. There the law compels all bakers to make their loaves of a unl fona wfe/ght, ad the people know what they are buying and how much a pound they are paving. Here, where wheat was never so low in the memory ©f liv­ ing man, the people are taxed as much as ever for Aour and bread. In ait in­ terview with A New York bakor he aaid /l Well, suppose flour has gone down, do you suppose we're going to lower oar price, so long as we have no ttrouble ie getting the priees we now .asJc? It aint reasonable to think go. I hope' you aewspaper fellows ain't a-going to play tho same trick us here AS was played in England sorue time ago. Why, the London papers showed up the bakers fearful. Tliey said that though breadstuff's was low, bread was high and country papers followed suit and Lord bless you the bakers had to give in, So mil we if it comes to the tug.

Wong Chin Foo, the Chinese ex journalist, tells how his countrymen get into business in America. He says: "One of my race arrives here with no money and in debt to his friends or to the banker for fcb.e steamer and railroad fare. He generally engages himself as & greenhorn or apprentice to some suc­ cessful laundryman. Although the compensation is small ($4 or $5per week and board),for the six months or one year of his contract, he learns the business, pays his debts, and gains a good name for integrity and capability. At the end of his term, if he is a skilled workman, he can either secure first-class wages ($18 per week), or open a laundry of his own. The latter is his usual course. He may see, for example, a laundry for sale for $600 whose looks and location he likes, and he himself has but $50 to his name. He goes to Motfc street and there on the bulletin board puts up a notice for a 'whev,'or syndicate of twelve men with $50 each fco meet him at a certain time and place, the meeting is hal, and if he is regarded as honest and capable the requisite $550 is given to him, he in return acknowledging the indebtedness, and promising to pay a certain interest on the money advanced (generally 20 per eent. per annum). This money is payed back in monthly installments, so that at the end of the year the borrower is free from debt, his credit unimpaired and the laundry ab­ solutely his own."

As to Minnesota County Bridges. In reply to County Attorney Eaton of Wright, Attorney General Halm holds that adjoining counties are not obliged to build bridges over streams dividing them, when the towns adjoin­ ing in each county have refused so to do. Towns so adjoining are not obliged to build such bridges. The several towns in any coun­ ty aro obliged to keep county roads and bridges in repair, but not to build them. A coun­ ty is liable for damages sustained by reason of a defective or broken bridge, ii the defect is in the construction and the bridge a county bridge or part of a county road. If such work is undertaken by the county it must be done in a workmanlike manner. It', however, the defect is a latent defect, and the county has taken due care in the construction of the bridge, it is not liable. If tho damage is caused by want of repair, the town whoso duty is to keep such portion of tho county road in repair is liable. The liability lies where the duty lies.

That is, the creditors get tho preferred stock of tho new company, which is guaranteed a 7 per cent divideud out of tlio first earnings.

It will take some time to carry out the detail? of tho reorganization, but no serious difficulties will probably be met.

A Confederate colon­ el ran ahead of his regiment at Malvern Hill, and discovering that the men were not following him as closely as he wished ho uttered a fierce oath, and ex­ claimed "Come on! Do you want to live for­ ever The appeal was irresistible, and many a poor fellow who had langhed at the colonel's queer exhortation laid down his life soon after. A shell struck the wheel of a Federal field -piece toward the close of the en­ gagement at Fair Oaks, and, shivering the spokes, dismantled the cannon. "Well, isn't it luoky that didn't happen before we used UD all our am­ munition," remarked one of the artil­ lerists as he crawled from beneath the gun. When General Pope was falling back before Lee's advance in the Virginia Valley, his own soldiers thought^ his bulletins and orders somewhat strained iu their rhetoric. At one of the num­ erous running engagements that marked that disastrous campaign, a private in one of the Western regiments was mortally wounded by a shell. Seeing the man's condition, a chap!: .' i^ knelt beside him, and opening his J3ible at random read out Samson's slaughter oi the Philistines with the jaw-bone of an ass. He had not quite finished when, as the story runs,the poor fellow inter­ rupted the reading by saying: Hold on chaplain. Don't deceive a dy­ ing man. Isn't the name of John Pope signed to that?" A column of troops was pushing for­ ward over the long and winding road, in Thoroughfare Gap to be:ul off Lee af­ ter his retreat across tho Potomac at the close of the Gettysburg campaign. Suddenly the signal otlioor who ac­ companied the general in command discovered that some of his men, posted on a high hill in the rear, wore report­ ing the presence of a considerable body of Confederate troops on top of the bluffs to the righ. A halt was at once sounded, and the leading brigade ordered forward to uncover the enemy's position. The regiments were soon scrambling up the steep incline, of­ ficers and men gallantly racing to see who could reach the crest first. A young lieutenant and some half dozen men gained the advance, but at the end of what they deemed a perilous climb, they were thrown into convulsions of laughter at discovering that what tho signal men took for Confederate troops were only a tolerably large ilock of sheep. As the leaders in this forlorn hope rolled on the grass in a paroxysm of merriment, they laughed all the louder at seeing the pale determined, faces ol' their comrades, who, of course, came up fully expecting a desperate hand-to-hand stiuggle. It is perhaps needless to say the brigade supped on mutton that even­ ing. As tho army was crossing the South Mountain the day before the battle of Antietam, General McClellan rode along the side of the moving column. Overtaking a favorite Zouave regiment, lie exclaimed with his natural bon­ homie "Well, and how is the Old Fifth this evening?" "First-rate, General," replied one of the Zouaves. "But we'd be better ofl if we weren't living so much on supposi­ tion." "Supposition?" said the General, in. a puzzled tone. "What do you mean, by at'?" "It, easily explained, sir. You see we expected to get oui rations yester­ day, but as we didn't we're living on the supposition that, we did." "Ah, I understand yon shall have your rations, ZouZous, to-night," re­ plied the general, putting spurs to his horse to escape the cheers of his regi­ ment. And he kept his promise. Sunshine and Shadow. From the Chicago News. "The officer tells mo that you were drunk and disorderly and that you have often been arrested for the same of­ fense." said Justice Foote recertly, as he frowned through iiis eye-glasses at a hard-looking woman who stood before him. "I have no sympathy for women like you, and I will fine yon a bun—" "Papa!" interrupted a little voice clear and sweet, and two soft firms stole around the judicial nock and a soft face was laid against the judicial cheek. Justice Foote's fro .vn changed to a smile "Aha. you rascal!" said he, seiz­ ing bin littio daughter and seating her on his knee. "So you came to see me just while I :im hard at work, did you, snd you slipped up behind me and tried to scare your old pup Ah, you!" and he gave her a great hug. Clerk Clingen poised bis pen, ready to record the fine, the lawyers took their seats with a smile the prisoner was left alono before the bar. She looked at the little child and passed her sleeve over her eyes. For five min­ utes the old head and the young head nodded at each other, and while from two red lips came a wonderful story of "Oh! such fun at tho park! and how fanny the deers looked!" Then a bright. ten-cent piece was produced fn the Justice's pocket and put into a little baud Then came a long, hard hug, and tho girl skipped away, shouting irood-bye as she wen! through the crowd. When Justice Fcote turned his face toward the court room there, was spread ov»r it a smile that would have graced the countenance of a saint. "Where was 1 he asked, as he rubbed his gln.sses and looked down at the sheet. "Oh yes, this drunk and disorderly case." Then he looked at the prisoner. "You look like you might have been a, decent g'rl once," said he I will give you one more chance. The prisoner is dis­ charged.
