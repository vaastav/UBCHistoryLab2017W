native chiefs. Bonds have been opened and steamboats placed on the river, and the nul cet of States established at twenty-two sta tions under one flag, which offers freedom to ■commerce and prohibits the slave-trade. The objects of the society are philanthrophic. It does not aim at permanent political control, but it seeks the neutrality of the valley. The United States cannot be indifferent to this work nor to the interests of their citizens in volved in it. It may become advisable for us to co-operate with other commercial powers in promoting- the rights öf trade and residence Cn the Congo Valley free from the interfer ence or political control of any one nation. THE COFFEE 7 RADE. I have alluded, in my previous message, to the injurious and vexatious restrictions suf fered by our trade in the Spanish West Indies. Brazil, whose natural outlet for its great national slave coffee is in and through the United States, imposes a heavy export duty upon that product. ■ OUR PETROLEUM EXPORTS are hampered in Turkey and other Eastern ports by restrictions as to storage and by onerous taxation. For these mischiefs ade quate relief is not always provided by reci procity treaties like that with Hawaii, or that lately negotiated with Mexico and now await ing the action of the Senate. Is it not advis able to provide some measure of equitable retaliation in relations with governments -which discriminate against our own? If, for example, the Executive were empowered to apply to Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and Porto Rico the same rules of treat ment and scale of penalties for technical faults which are applied to our vessels and cargoes in the Antilles, a resort to that course might not be barren of good results. THE FINANCES. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury igivés a full and interesting exhibit of the financial condition of the country.

Hitherto the surplus, as rapidly as it has ac -curnulated, has been devoted to the reduction of the national debt As a result, the only Tbonds now outstanding which are redeemable .-at the pleasure of the Government, are the 3 per cents, amounting to about 305,000,000. The 44 per cents, amounting to $250,000,000, and the $737,000,000 4 per cents are not paya ble until 1891 and 1907 respectively. If the sur plus shall hereafter be as large as the Treasu ry estimates now indicate, the 3 per cent bonds may all be redeemed at least four years before .any of the 4 Vi per cents can be,called in. The latter, at the same rate of accumulation of surplus, can be paid at maturity and t ie moneys requisite tor the redemption of the 4 T>er cents wiii be in the treasury many years ■before those obligations become payable. THE NATIONAL DEBT. There are cogent reasons, however, why the national debt should not be thus rapidly extinguished. Chief among them is the fact that only by excessive taxation is such rapidity attainable. In a communication to Congress at its last session 1 recommended that all excise taxes be abolished except those relating to distilled spirits, and that substan tial reductions also be made in the revenues from customs. A statute has since been enact ed by which the annual tax and tariff receipts of the Government have been cut down to the extent of at least $50,000,000 or $60 ,000,000. While I have no doubt that still further reduc tions may be wisely made, I do not advise the adoption at this session of any measures for large diminution of tiie national revenue. 1 he results of the legislation of last session have not as yet become sulliciently apparent to justify any radical revision or sweeping modi fications of existing law. In the interval which must elapse before the cffects of the act of March 3, 1883, can be definitely as certained, a portion at least of the surplus revenues may bo wisely applied to the long neglected duty of rehabilitating our na tion and providing coast defenses for the protection of our harbors. This is a matter to which I will again advert. NATIONAL CURRENCY". Immediately associated with the financial subject just discussed'is the important ques tion, What legislation is needed regarding the national currency? The aggregate amount of bonds now on deposit in tho treasury to sup port the national bank circulation is about |a r )0,000,003. Nearly $2.0,000 000 of this amount consists of 3 per cents, which, as already stat ed, are payable at the pleasure of the Govern ment, and are likely to be called in within less than four years unless, in the meantime, the surplus revenues shall be diminished. The probable effect of such an extensive retire ment of the securities which are the basis of the national hank circulation would be such a contraction of the volume of the currency as to produce grave commercial embarrass inetfts. How can the danger be obviated? The most effectual plan, and one whose adop tion at the earliest practicable opportunity I shall heartily approve, has already been indi cated. If the revenues of the next four years shall be kept substantially commensuiat« with the expenses, the volume of circulation will not be likely to suffer any material dis turbance ; but, on the other hand, it there shall be great delay in reducing taxation, it will become necessary either to substitute some other form of currency in place of the national bank notes or to make important changes in the laws by which their circulation is now controlled. In my judgment the latter course is preferable. I commend to your at tention tho very interesting and thoughtful suggestions on this subject which appear in the Secretary's report. The objections wh:en ho urges against the acceptance of other securities than the obligations of Govern ment itself as a foundation for national bank circulation, seem to me insuperable. THE TRADE DOLLAR was coined for the purpose of traffic in coun tries where silver passed at its value, as ascer tained by its weight, and business. It never had a legal tender quality. Large numbers ot these coins entered, however, into the volume of our currency. By common consent their circulation in domestic trade has now ceased and thev have thus become a disturbing ele ment. They should not be longer permitted to embarrass our currency system. I recom mend that provision be made for their recep tion by the Treasury and mints as bullion, at a small percentage above the current market price of silver of like fineness. CUSTOMS DISTRICTS The Secretary of the Treasury advises a consolidation of certain of the customs dis tricts of the country, and suggests that the President be vested with such power in rela tion thereto as is now given him in respect to collectors of internal revenue by section 3,141 of the llevised Statutes. The statistics on this subject which are contained in his report furnish of themselves a strong argument in defense of his views. At the adjournment of Congress the number of internal revenue col lection districts was 12«. By executive orders dated June 25,1883,1 directea that certain of these districts be consolidated. The result has been a reduction of one-third their num ber, which at present is but eighty-three. 

INDIAN TRIBES. From the report of the Secretary of War it will be seen that in only a single instance has there been any disturbance of the quietcondi tion of our Indian tribes—a raid from Mexico into Arizona by a small party of ndians, which was pursued by Gen. Crook into the mountain region from which they had come. It is con fidently hoped that serious outbreaks will not again occur, and that the Indian tribes which have for so many years terrified the West will remain in peaceable submission. SEA COAST DEFENSES. I again call your attention to the present condition of our extended sea coast, upon which there are so many large cities whose wealth and importance to the country would, in time of war, invite attacks from modern armored ships, against which our existing de fensive works could give no adequate protec tion. These works were built before the in troduction of modern heavy rifled guns into maritime warfare, and if they are not put in an efficient condition we may easily be sub jected'to humiliation by a hostile power great ly inferior to ourselves. As germain to this subject I call your attention to the import ance of perfecting our submarine torpedo defenses. Tho board authorized by tho last Congress to report on the method which should be adopted for the manufacture of heavy ord nance adapted to modern warfare, has visit ed the principal iron and steel works in this country and Europe. It is hoped that its report will soon be -ihade, ànd that Con gress will thereupon bo disposed to provide suitable facilities and plans for tho manufac ture of such guns as are now imperatively needed. 

STATE MILITIA. On several occasions during the past year officers of the army have, at the request of tho State authorities, united their military en campments for inspection of the troops. From the roports of these officers, I am induced to believe the encouragement of the State mili tia organization by the National Govcjjnment would be followed by very gratifying Results, and would afford it in sudden emergencies the aid of a large body of volunteers, educated in the performance of military duties. . THE NAVY. The Secretary of the Navy reports that un der the authority of the acts of August 5,1882, and March 3,1883, the work of strengthening our navy by the construction of modern ves sels has been auspiciously begun. Three cruisers are in process of construction; the Chicago of 4,500 tons displacement, and the Boston and Atlanta, each of 2.500 tons. They are to be built of steel, with the tensile strength and ductility prescribed by law, and n combination of speed, endurance and arm ament are expected to compare favorably with the best unarmed war vessels of other nations. A fourth vessel, the Dolphin, is to be constructed of similar material, and is in tended to serve as a fleet dispatch boat. The double-turreted monitors Puritan, Amphitrite and Terror have been launched on the Dela ware Biver, and a contract has been made for the supply of their machinery. A similar monitor, the Monadnock, has been launohed in California. The Naval Advisory Board and the Secretary recommend the completion of the monitors, the construction of four gun boats and three additional steel vessels like the Chicago, Boston and Dolphin, as an im portant measure of defense. The Secretary urges also the immediate creation of an INTERIOR COAST-LINE OF WATER-WAYS across the peninsula of Florida, along the coast from Florida to Hampton Boads, be tween the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Biver, and through Cape Cod. I feel bound to impress upon the attention of Congress the necessity of continued progress in the recon struction of the navy. The condition of th® public treasury, as I have already intimated, makes the present an auspicious time for put ting this branch of service in a state if effi ciency. It is no part of our policy to create and maintain a navy able to cope with that of the other great powers of the world. We have no wish for foreign conquest, and the peace which we have long enjoyed is in no seeming danger of interruption. But, that our naval strength should be made adequate for the de fense of our harbors, the protection of our commercial interests and the maintenance of our national honor, is a proposition from which no patriotic citizen can withhold his assent. THE 

POST OFFICB, The report of the Postmaster-General con tains a gratifying exhibit of the condition and prospects of this interesting branch of the public service committed to his care. It appears that oil June 30, 1883, the whole num ber of Post-offices was 47.803, of which 1,6£. were established during the previous yei.f The number of offices operating under the svstem of free delivery was 154. At these latter offices the postage on local matter amounted to $4,195,230.52, a sum ex ceeding by $1,021,894,01 the eutire cost otthe earners' service of the country. Tho rate of postage on drop letters passing through these offices is now fixed by law at two cents per half ounce or fractions thereof. In offices where the carrier system has not been estab lished the rate is only half as largo. It will be remembered that in 1863, when freo delivery was first established by law,the uniform single rate postage upon local letters was one cent, and so it remained until 1872, when in those cities where carrier service was established it was increased in order to defray the ex penses of such service. It seems to me that the old rate may now with propriety be re stored, and that too even at the risk of dimin ishing, f<jr a time at least, the receipts from postage upon local letters. 1 er see no rea son why that particular class <> .uill matter should be held accountable for i • entire-cost ot not only its own collection and delivery, but the collection and delivery of all other classes, and I am confident, after lull consideration of the subject, that the reduction of the rate would be followed by such a growing acces sion of business as to occasion but slight and temporary loss to the revenues of the Post office Department. THE TELEGRAPH. The Postmaster-General devotes much of his report to the consideration in its various as pects of the Government's relation to the tele graph. Such reflection as I have been able to give to this subject since my last annual mes sage, has not led me to change the view which I then expressed in dissenting from the rec ommendation of the Postmaster-General that the Government assume tho same control over the telegraph which it has always exer cised over tho mail. Admitting that its au thority in the premises is as ample as has ever been claimed for it, it would not in my judgment, be a wise use of that authority to purchase or assume tho control of existing telegraph lines or to construct others, with a view of entering into general competition with private enterprises. The objections which may be justly urged against cither of these projects, and indeed against any system which would require an enormous increase in the civil service, do not, however, apply to some of the plans which have lately provoked comment and discussion. It has been claimed, for example, that Congress might wisely authorize the Postmaster-General to contract with some private persohs or corpo ration for tho transmission of messages at specified rates and under Government super vision. Various such schemes of the same general nature, but widely differing in their special characteristics, have been suggested in the public prints, and the arguments by which thev have been supported and opposed have doubtless attracted your attention. It is likely that the whole subject will be considered by you at the present session. In the natu re of things it involves so many questions of detail that your deliberations would probably be aided slightly, if at all, by any particular sug gestions which I might now submit. I avow my belief, however, that the Government should be authorized by law to exercise some sort of supervision over inter-state telegraph communication, and I express the hope that for attaining that end some measure may be aevised which will receive your approbation. 

JURORS" FEES. The Attorney-General criticises, in his re port, the provisions of existing laws fixing the fees of jurors and witnesses in the Federal Courts. These provisions are chiefly contained in the act of February 26,1853, though some of them were introduced into that act from statutes which had been passed many years previous. It is manifest that such compensa tion as might, when these laws were enacted, have been just and reasonable, would in many instances be justly regarded at the present day as inadequate. I concur with the Attor ney-General in the belief that the statutes should be revised by which these fees are reg ulated. 

ATTORNEYS* AND MARSHALS FEES. So, too, should the laws which regulate tho compensation of District Attorneys and Mar shals. They should be paid wholly by salaries instead of in part by fees, as is now the case. Tho change would prove to be a measure of economy and would discourage the institution of needless and oppressive legal proceedings which it is to be feared have in some in stances been conducted for the mere «ike of personal gain. PENSION FRAUDS. Much interesting and varied information is contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior. I particularly call your attention to his presentation of certain phases of tho In dian question: to his recommendations for the repeal of the pre-emption and timber cul ture acts, and for more stringent legislation to prevent frauds under the pension laws. The statutes which prescribed the definitions and punishments of crimes relating to pen sions could doubtless be made more effectivf by certain amendments and additions whic' i are pointed out in the Secretary's report. ILLITERACY. I have previously referred to the alarr; ing state of illiteracy in certain portions oi the country, and again submit for the considera tion of Congress whether some Federal aid should be extended to public primary educa tion wherever adequate, provision therefor has not already been made. UTAH POLYGAMY. The Utah Commission has submitted to the Secretary of the Interior its second annual re port—the result-of its labors in supervising the recent election in the Territory, pursuant to the act of March 22,1882. It appears that the persons by that act disqualified, to the number of about 12,000. were excluded from the polls.. This fact, however, affords little cause for congratulation.and I l'ear that it is far from indicating any real and substantial progress toward the exti rpation of polygamy. All of the members of the l egislature are Mormons. There is grave reason to believe that they are in sympathy with the practices that the Gov ernment is seeking to suppress, and tl at its efforts in that regard will be more likely to encounter their opposition than receive tneir encouragement and support. Even if this view should happily be erroneous, the law under which the commissioners have been acting should bo made moro effective by the incorporation of some such stringent meas ures as they recommend, as were included in bill No. 2,238 on the calendar of the Senate at its last session. I am convinced, however, that polygamy ha< become so strongly intrenched in the Territory of Utah that it is profitless to attack it with any but the stoutest weapons which constitutional legislation can fashion. I favor, therefore, the repeal of the act. Upon the existing Government depends the assump tion by the National Legislature of the entire political control of the Territory, and the es tablishment of a commission with sue.i pow ers and duties as shall be delegated to it by law. CATTLE DISEASK. The Department of Agriculture is accom plishing much in the direction of the agricul tural development of the country, and the re port of the Commissioner, giving the results of his investigation and experiments, will be found interesting and valuable. At his in stance, a convention of those interested in the cattle industry of the country was lately held at Chicago. The prevalence of pleuro pneumonia and other contagious diseases of animals was one of the chief topics of discus sion. A committee of tho convention will in vite your co-operation in investigating the causes of these diseases and providing meth ods for their prevention and cure. ALASKA. I trust that Congress will not fail at its pres ent session to put Alaska under the protec tion of law. Its people have repeatedly re monstrated against our neglect to afford them the maintenance and protection expressly guaranteed by the terms of the treaty where by that Territory was ceded to the United States. For sixteen years they- have pleaded in vain forthat which they should have receiv ed without tho asking. They have no laws for the collection of debts, the support of educa tion, the conveyance of property, the admin istration of estates "or the enforcement of contracts. None, indeed, for the punishment of criminals, except such as offend against certain customs, commerce ami navigation acts. CONTROLING RAILWAYS. Complaints have lately been numerous and urgent that certain corporations controling, in whole or in part, the facilities for the inter State carriage of persons and merchandise over the great railroads of the country have resorted in their dealings with the public to divers measures unjust and oppressive in their character. In some instances the State Gov ernments have attacked and suppressed theso evils, but in others they have been unable to afford adequate relief because of the jurisdic tional limitations which are imposed upon them by the Federal Constitution. The ques tion how far the National Government may lawfully interfere in the premises, and what, if any, supervision or control it ought to exer cise, "is one which merits your careful consid eration. While we can not fail to recognize the importance of the vast railway systems of the country and their great and beneficial in fluences upon the development of our ma terial wealth, we should on the other hand remember that no individual and no corporation ought to be invested with absolute power over the interest of any other citizen or class of citizens. The right of these railway corporations to award and profitable return upon their investments and to reasonable free dom in their regulations must bo recognized, but it seems only just that, so far as its consti tutional authority will permit,Congress should protect the people at large in their inter-State traffic against acts of injustice, which the State Governments are powerless to prevent. FOREST PROTECTION. In my last annual message I called attention to the necessity of protecting, by suitable legislation, the forests situated upon the pub lic domain. In many portions of the West the pursuit of general agriculture is only made practicable by resort to irrigation, while suc cessful irrigation would be impossible with out the aid afforded by forests in contributing to the regularity and constancy of supply of water. During the past year severe suffering and great loss of property have been occasioned by profuse floods, followed by periods of unusu ally low water in many ot the great rivers of the country. These irregularities were in a great measure caused by the removal from about the sources of the streams in question ol' the timber by which the water supply had been nourished and protected. The preser vation of such portion of the forests on the national domain as essentially contribute to the equable flow of important watercourses, is ot the highest consequence. Important tributaries of the Missouri—the Columbia and the Saskatchewan—rise in the mountains of Montana, near the northern boundary of the United States, betwoen the Blackfeet and Flathead Indian Beservations. This region is unsuitable for settlement, but upon the rivers which flow from it depends the future agri cultural djvelopinentof a vast tract of coun try. The attention of Congress is called to the necessity of withdrawing from the public sale this part of the public domain and estab lishing there a forest preserve. THE INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITIONS which have been held in the United States during the present year attracted attention in many foreign countries where the an nouncement of those enterprises had been made public through the foreign agencies of this Government. The Industrial Exhibition of Boston and the Southern Exhibition of Louisville were largely attended by the exhib itors of foreign countries, notwithstanding the absence of any professional characteris tics in those undertakings. The Centennial Ex position to be held nextyear at New Orleans in commemoration of the centenary of the first shipment of cotton from a port of the United States bids fair to meet with like gratifying success. Under the act of Congress of the 10th of February, 1883, declaring that exposi tion to be national and international in its char acter, all foreign governments with which the United States maintain relations have been invited to participate. The promoters of this important undertaking have already received assurances of the lively interest which it haï excited abroad. 

CIVIL SERVICE. The Commissioners who were appointed un der act of January 16, 1883, entitled "An Act to regulate and improve the Civil Service of the United States," entered promptly upon the discharge of these duties. Aseries of rules framed in accordance with the spirit of the statute was approved and promulgated by the President. In some particulars wherein they seu-.ned defective those rules were subse quent!' amended. It will be seen that they discountenance any political or religious tests V jr admission to the public service to which the statute relates. The act is limited in its original application to the classified clerk ships in the several executive depart ment at Washington, numbering about 5,600, and similar positions in customs dis trict and post-offices where as many as fifty persons aro employed. A classification of these positions analo go as to that existing in the Washington offices wis duly made before the law went into effect. H .eve n customs districts and twenty-three y ost-offices were thus brought under immedi ate operation of the statute. The annual re port of the Civil Service Commission, which will soon be submitted to Congress, will afford the means of a more definite judgment than I am now prepared to express as to the merits of the new system. I am persuaded that its effects have thus tar proved beneficial. The practical methods appear to be adequate for the ends proposed, and there has been no se rious difficulties in carrying them into effect. Since the 16th of July last, no person, so far as I am aware, has been appointed to the public service in the classified portions thereof in any of the departments, or ut any of the post-offices and customs districts' above named, except those certified by the Commission to be the most competent, on the basis of the examina tiona held in conformity to the rules. THE 

EXECUTIVE. At the time when the present Executive en tered upon his office, his death, removal, res ignation, or inability to discharge his duties would have left the Government without a constitutional head. It is possible, of course, that a similar contingency may again arise, unless tho wisdom of Congress shall provide against its recurrence. The Senate, at its last session, after full consideration, passed an af t relating to this subject which will now, T trust, commend itself to the approval of botïl houses of Congress. The clause of the Con stitution upon which must depend any law regulating the Presidential succession, pre sents also for solution, other questions of paramount importance. These questions re late to THE 

PROPE* INTERPRETATION OPTHE PHRASE, "Inability to discharge the powers and'duttes of said office," our organic law providing that when the President shall suffer from such ina bility the Presidential office shall devolve up on the Vice-President, who must himself, un der like circumstances, give place to such offi cers as Congress may by law appoint to act as President. I need not here set forth the nu merous and interesting inquiries which are suggested by these words of the Constitution. They were fully stated in my first communie» tion to Congress, and have since been the sub ject of frequent deliberation in that body. It is greatly to be hoped that these momentous questions will find speedy solution, lest emergencies may ariso when longer ftelay be impossible, and any determination, albeit the wisest, may furnish cause for anxiety and alarm. 

VETOING APPROPRIATIONS. For the reasons fully stated in my last an nual message, I repeat my recommendation that Congress propose an amendment to that provision of the Constitution which prescribes the formalities for the enactment of laws whereby in respect to bills for the appropria tion of public money the Executive may bo enabled, white giving his approval to particu lar items, to interpose hfe veto as to sucn others as do not commend themselves to his judg ment. CITIZENSHIP. Tho fourteenth amendment of the JConstitu tion confers the rights of citizenship upon all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. It was the special purpose of this amendment to insure members of tho colored race the full enjoyment of civil and political rights. Cer tàin statutory provisos intended to secure tho enforcement of those rights have been re cently declared unconstitutional by the Su preme Court. Any legislation whereby Congress may lawfully supplement the guarantees which the Constitution affords for the equal enjoy ment by all citizens of the Un ft cd States of every right, privilege and Immunity of citi zenship, will receive my un hesitating approval.

Eear in mincl that wool, like all animal product, is made from food. <rood way to cook potatoes for breakfatt is to cut medium-sized ones in quarters, drop them into hot lard and fry till brown, the same as dough nuts.—-V. 1' 1'ost. An Ohio farmer has found that a bushel of timothy contains over 55,000, 000 seeds, or about eight seeds to every square inch if spread uniformly over an acre of land. —To clean carpets: Dampen some Indian meal, mix salt with it _ ana sprinkle over the carpet; sweep vigor ously. Take a small, sharp-ptfinted stick to remove the salt and meal from cracks and corners.— Chicago Journal.' —A flower -garden is incomplete with out a bed of gladiole, the bulbs of which once planted are sure to bloom. They, require a deep, rich soil, a sunny situ ation, and ought to be rather deeply planted in order to prevent their neiiHj injured by the heavy rains. N. 1. Times. —Mince Meat: One bowl chopped: meat, two bowls of apples, quarter of a pound of suet, grated rind and juice of one lemon, two teacups molasses, one laige teaspoon each of cinnamon and cloves, one nutmeg, one pound raisins, half a pound currants, quarter pound citron, salt and sugar to taste.— N. Y. Tribune. —Unless you have hired helpwhom you can trust implicitly, it is a good idea to use earthen dishes for milk in place of tin; they are kept clean witli much less trouble. The scientists of the present day and hour claim that the germs of disease hide in the crevices of a milk-pan, and that nothing but con scientious application of absolutely boiling water will remove the danger. —The New Enqland Homestead has known cows to milk themselves to death. Great milkers, he says, require not only plenty of food and good care but they must have a rest from milk production occasionally if they are to preserve their vitality. W hen such cows get run down, they should be dried off and treated with stimulating tonics. In the case of valuable thor oughbreds, it may even be profitable to have the assistance of a veterinary. —Banking up farmers' houses for the. winter is usually necessary to keep the house reasonably warm, yet it too often robs the cellar of all ventilation. As most farmers' cellars contain fruits and vegetable, that are more or less liable to'decay, the health of the family will require, in every tightly banked house, a frequent ventilation of the cellar by opening the windows or bulkhead on mild'sh days. It is cheaper to attend to a little matter of this kind than to pay doctor's bills. We believe in plot ting against doctors every time.— Troy Times. One of the Usual Sort. "Let me have five two-cent stamps* please," said a lady to the retail stamp clerk in the post-oilice yesterday. "Yessum," he said, handing them out. "Can't you let me have them in one piece?'' she asked. "Certainly, ma'am," said the clerk. "Can I send them home for you?" "Oh, no; I don't live far away—only on the North Side--and I am going right home. I wouldn't want to put you to the trouble." "No trouble at all," said the clerk. "I haven't much to do to-day and could very easily spare an hour." "Very much obliged," said the lady, smiling sweetly. "Bear me," she said, putting on a stamp. "What a horrid' bother it is to stamp letters! Why can't we send letters and let the post-officei send in their bill once a month?" "They might just as well," said the clerk, sympathizingly. "I'll mention the fact in my next message to Con gress." "Will you? How nice! But yon mustn't mention my name. Say th& idea was suggested by a North Side society lady, won't you?" "Certainly, ma'am," said the clerk. "That's the second letter I have sent to Gerty," said the lady, buttoning her gossamer. "Gerty is the sweetest girl —going to Yassar now." ''How does Gerty like Vassar?'' asked the clerk. "Oli, Gerty likes Yassar lirst-rate; only she says they don't see much com pany." "Paper! all about the election!" screamed a newsboy. "Dear me!" exclaimed the lady, "did they have an election yesterday? Who is President now?!' "Afthur, I believe," said the clerk. "Why, I thought Arthur was Presi. dent last yeai? ' "Yes, but he is still President." "What was the election for, then?" ' "For gaugers of marmalade and in spectors of hot biscuit," said the clerk.; "Oh! well, I hope they'll get good! men. ,1 attended the Woman's Con gress awhile ago, and you know it waa decided that the ladies ought to take more interest in public affairs. Well, good-by," and she sallied away. "Who is that woman?" asked the next man in the line, who was shaking and shivering with rage. "Bust me if I know," said the clerk. And the outflow of stamps proceeded. —Chicago Inter Ocean. —The American, of Waterbury, Conn., tells of a horse that is left un hitched in a shed while its owner spends some time in a saloon every evening. If its owner stays longer than usual the horse backs out the buggy, and, going to the saloon, mounts the steps and looks through the glass until his master comes out andj drives away.
