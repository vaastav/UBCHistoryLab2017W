Comments upon President Lincoln's Message. ,Tbe New York Worll has the following comments o poo. the President's Message. The remarks of the World wilt be accepted bj every intelligent reader, not prejudiced by devotion to Abolitionism, as eminently jasL. "The article exhausts the small sub ject bf in criticism, and leaves nothing more to be said : THK PREMDCNT's MtSSAGK Considering that the President whose . oarth annual message is now before as, is to preside for lour years more over fie des tinies of tbe country, through a period of difficulty and pent, it would gratify tbe na tional pride, even of bis political opponents, if Ibis document exhibited him as a states man of good. abilities. Bat we have not that consolation'. A more tame, jejune, common-place stste paper never emanated from a man clothed with high responsibili ties. It it, in the main, a tepid recital of. certain points and statistics from tbe reports of the head of the Executive Departments, in a style not tet er than is attained by ev ery abridger of document in & newspaper. It does doi reach even the subordinate mer its of method and prepartion. The navy, which bas done next to nothing besides maintaining the blockade, occupies five times the space given to the army ; and tbe notice of our military operations is in two widelj separated parts, a if the ma'erial of the message had been tumbled together by accident. Faults of arrangement, how- j ever are trivial when compared with pov erty of matter. Tbe brevity 'of tbe message ; "would, under any circumstances, be a merit, but in ibis case tbe merit would have been more conspicuous, bad it been still shorter. Succinctness resulting from closeness and condensation, is a very different thing from the penury ot a barren intellect. The in tellectual poverty of the message is in no degree a'oned for by patriotic fervor or ele vatioa of sentiment. It is amazing that a maa called to be the chief actor in the most momentous civil struggle the world ever saw is lifted to no inspiration, it Mr. Lin coln understood bis epoch, one would natu rally expect that i s grandeur would impress bis imagination. B-jt the message is as cold as it is feeble. We would not be nn derstood ty this criticism as implying that a state paper should ever be a rhapsody ; but a mind deeply impressed easily stirs other minds to their profoandest depths without any breach of decorum. Forecast ing sagacity and a vigorous grasp of the situation would be worth all the feelling in tbe world-;-bul when-a Chief Magistrate cannot instruct and guide, it would be some j partial atonement if he could inspire, elec Wrify, or encourage. But in Mr. Lincoln ! debility of intellect keeps company with a torpor and vulgarity of feeling. He never rises to the level, or even appreciates the proprieties of a great occasion The coarse and scanty drapery in which he clothes hi marveling conceptions is perhaps a merit ; it can at any rate, be said in his favor that his style matches well with bis matter. lo each of his last two messages, Mr. Lincoln made a laborious effort to rise above he de8d level of common-place, by the preservation of a project. Bat in both cases his feat of statesmanship was onsuccessfal. la 1862 he expounded at great length a febeme for compensated emancipation . in all tbe slave States, to be completed by the year 19(0. This was (he only salient thing in that message ; but it was treated with con'empt -even by his own party. It did not live long enough to cry ; so far as we can recollect, it never received ibe compti meat of discussion in tbe body to which it, was addressed.. In 1863 he propounded mother scheme, but to escape the con emptoos treatment of its predecessor, ii vas cunningly devised to dispense with he Congressional co-operation. This vnt he famous reconstruction project, i;i which e 'astutely argued lLat setting up i.ew 7 ate governments and pre-cribiug the qua! ;icaiiori (or suffrage was a right which he ould exercise in virtue of the pardoning ower! His own party in Congress was so ir from acquiescing in. this odd assump ion, that they interposed and passed an act j supersede his plan ; and when he vetoed ', (he'Republican chairmen of the appro rials' committees of the two boses gave im a public cattigatio!) in a paper marked y great force-of reasoning and vigor of in eciie. Een the party convention that ominated him for re election was prodent- , -..j - n .... ...... vi. v ...tc-o ....... c-, uo r i the present message no attempt to turn is vehicle (no coacb, but a can) out -of 3 rut of true common-place. He con-J nts his ambition with doll abstracts of the j -"irts of his secretaries, and servile ech ;f the Republican pres.?. Vitr one or - -urntficant exceptions, there is not a uea in the message: certainly none i tiy mortal will remember when the - is a month old. uch a document affords no scope for r icular comment. It is beneath it. It is to confute what nobody will remember; I as for commendation, even the Repub an organs wilt be at a loss where to be- it. Mr. Lincoln holds out no hope of ce ; he has nothing mure original to say n lo rsi'.ersts and expaad his Niagara manifesto. Iu a curious finencial reoorn mendation he deviates for once into origi nality; but "it is an originality which is painfully suggestive of a low tone of moral feeling. We most indeed concede to Mr. Lincoln the possession of a perfec:ly bal anced character; his conscience is worthy of his interject, and his sense of decorum worthy of both. He gravely recommends that our Government shall raise money from ourci izens by corrupting their sense of pecuniary honor ! He wants Congress to past an act to .proteet the purchasers of Government bonds from paying their honest, debts)! He gravely recommends that this species of property shall be be yond the reach not only of taxation but of creditors. This, from the President of the United States, is a creditable proposal! Bat when foreign natious, who never hit upon this refinement, shall see our Govern ment suggesting to our citizens a safe meth od of evading their private obligations will they not be apt to infer that where such morality prevails, it will be an easy step to public repudiation ? Private and public debts stand on the same ground of moral obligation, but the average conscience of man is commonly supposed to be the weaker in relation to public engagement. It is a spectacle as astounding as it is mel ancholy to see the Chief Magistrate of a great nation asking Congress to enable citizens lo cheat their creditors out of their honest dues. James McHknrt, Esq, one' of the forty fonr Fishingcreek prisoners, and merchant at Cambra, Luzernef connty. was released from Fort Mifflin a few days since, and ar rived at this place on Saturday last, alter an incarceration in a filthy bistile of over oie hundred davs. He was discharged wiih out the shadow of a trial. I; appeared (hat there were no charges pr-ferred against him. and after incarcerating the inr.ocen' man, in an unhealthy and diagreeable dun geon, for over three month, it was then just ascertained that Mr. McHcnrt had violated no law had not ottered any disloyal tenii ments nor had ha ever attempted to emhnr rass the administration! He had never resist ed or counseled resistance to any draft, and was not amenable to the lavs in anv re spect. Who is responsible for his arrest and incarceration t Who will award him the damages he as sustained in his business? Who can restore bis hea'th which no doubt has become greatly impaired by his confi ie menl in so unhealthy and filthy a bastile as Fort Miffl'n ? This administration will be held responsible for much of this tyranny ar.d oppression. Individuals, too, will have certain amount of illegal proceedings to! account for. There are Abolitionists in this county, yea. in this town, who were at (he head and front of all these illegal arrests were the chief cause of all these men snffWr ing what they have ; and to-day are skulking about among the Democrats en deavoring to make fair weather with those who have suffered imprisonment, and som e of them thereby death, for opinion's sake, lo gratify their political malice and spleen. Shame on these loytl descendants of lories! We know you all ! The Military force have finally. left Co lumbia county, save a deuiljof some nine or ten men, for Harrixbur and other parts of the State. We notice that the depart ment ol the Susquehanna bas been broken I up, by order of the War Department, and that the Sta'e of Pennsylvania shall consti tute one Military Department, with head quarters at Philadelphia, and Gex. Cadvval lader in command. We scarcely know how the good people of this coun'y can do without these troops! They have been among us ever since the 13;h of August, and from the best of onr knowledge have oot been of any particular service to 'Mhe Gjv ernment" or anybody else. The late draft went off and no more men entered the ser vice than would have went in had these sol diers not been in the coonty. The election has aleo passed off and the Democratic party has given as large a majority in this county as it would have given had these sold ers been in the Army of the Potomac assisting Grant to move on Petersburg. As we sai1 before we can't see how the good people of the county will be able to get a'ons wiih outthem. It is reported that Capt. Silver, acting Deputy Provost Marshal, secured the services of ien4o remain with him at this place, for his special benefit. Jcst bkfore the election the Abolition papers would bustle up and denounce the Democratic press as being guilty of lying or inventing some new electioneering scheme, whenever tbey would speak of an other draft to be made. A supplementary dralt has since been " rr.atfe. Thnt ii no "Copnerke'id lie," is i! Anche'.v Ccrtin has l ordered an enrollment to be made throngh-i out the State, for his draft, for those fifteen I Regiments! Is that a ''Copperhead lie ?" i We have, too, evidence from ibe War Da- partment (hat a heavy national draft will be made before the Spring campaign opens ! j Is tbi, too, a ' Copperhead lie." or "elec tioneering scheme !" Bie-s Abiahasi Lin coln, and may all who voted for him be drafted in lh r.ext drawing. Tuoe who voted for more tear, bloodshed, tiX'ition and conscription, should enjoy it. No Democrat will eny them these enjoyments. new advertisements in tnis issue i ney are not among ttie leant interesting matter of a local newspaper. If you wih 10 know what is offered in the market, what our merchants have tor sale, yon will torn t'j the advertisements for the required infor mation. AH good, thriving, honest, mer chant patronize the press."

Immediately alter tne election, Mr. Lin coln made a pitiful appeal to the public (in effect) to sustaiit all his acts, and ascribed the best intentions and. patriotism to thoe who had opposed him. How sincere ail this was the people i!l infer when ihey reflect upon the number of innocent men, and even women, now confined in bastile, without law, without even charge preferred i against (hem. and without knowing ,h their accuser is ! How sincere Mr Lincoln's professions are, peo de will know when they reflect that be has removed nearly all the Democratic Generals or driven them from the array, without cause, for any rea son based on pub!ic good, ar.d supplied heir places with Abolitionists in both cases without reference to qualifications or military character. How sincere he is may be more inferred from the lact that Demo cratic subordinate officers are not promoted by him, no matter how meritorious, unless they first give in their adhesion to abolition ism. How sincere he is may be well judg ed we know so well that no man but an Abolitionist can be appointed to any office of honor, or receive any distinction from the administration except to be cast into prison. Yet it is pretended by a few that this man the patron of plunderers and the impersona tion of deceit is honest I God preserve the Nation when tuck honesty roles it ! U hite thus begging for public support, Mr. Lincoln hugs to his bosom and feeds and fattens the knaves who bdoIv to Demo- crats, and induce their fo'fowers to apply, the name of a loathsome reptile, as though they deserved no be'ter treatment thanthat name indicates. Is that conduct consistent with the words of his speech, or would an honest or great man be guilty of such .con duct 1 ' No, Lincoln, the Democrats know yon, and they will watch you with an eagle eye. You shall r.ol trample upon the liberties of the people of this country at least not without such resistance at free speech and a free press can make. Disband the Democratic pary for ouy I Dan: you know that but for it, its thorough organization, and the stern maintenance of its principles, we would . even now have neither party or country 1 Well you Know it, and therein is the reason you now come to do with coaxing and flattery what you bae failed and ever will fail to do by bally- as ' ing and fhe bastile. The people are not half so blind as the ir blind leaders imagine, ar ,De worst frightened folks in the Nation t 'his lime at yonr success are those who supported you. Tbe Democracy stand firm invulnerable Clinton Democrat. A Supplementary Draft was made a few days since for the deficiency in those town bhip, i;i Columbia cooniy, which failed to fill their quotas on the last call. There were some six'y-two men drafted- We have not seen tbe list. We will give some of ibe heaviest deficiencies ; In Fishingcreek 15; Orange 15 ; Madison 10; and Benton 9. Notices are being served. All who voted for Old Ae lo carry on the war for negro emancipation should be blessed with a ticket. When men will sustain a President in carrying on a war for nd ether purpose, than the abolition of slavery, they should be made feel the hardships and depriva tions of such a war. If the war is earned on for any other purpor-e than the abolition of slavery, then we confess we do not under stand Lincoln's messages and proclama tions, and acknowledge that we have wrongly interpreted them. An impudent wretch came near getting his ears boxed, at a wedding reception the other day, for wishing the beautiful young bride. ''Many Happy Returns ol the Day." A codstrt girl in speaking of the polka, said that "the dancing was nothing bnt the hogging was heavenly." Ton Call it a Victory ! The late Presiden tia I election1 an ex ceedingly'close one, despite all the violence and fraud of the Abolition party. General McCIellan carried the .following States : Electors. Majorities. New Jersey, Kentucky, 5 7,402 11 3 38,000 550 43,942 7,000 10,000 2.427 2.541 2.C0O 1 7C0 5.051 5 000 10 000 45,719 DeIaware 21 Linclon carried New York, by fraud, 33 Pennsylvania, " Connecticut.-' " New Hampshire" Nevada, Oregon, " Rhode fsland, " 26 6 5 3 3 4 Maryland, by violence 7 Missouri, 11 98 These States, with 98 electors, giving a ,' majority of 43,7 19, were carried for Lincoln by open fraud and military violence. A fair election would have given them all to McCIellan, and they together with his. 21 electors wonld have given him 119lectors, a majority of the whole. Forty-five thou sand seven hundred and nineteen!! addition al votes would have made McCIellan Presi dent, or his majorities in Kentucky, New Jersey and Delaware, distributed in the above named.States, would' have defeated Lincoln. Such is the Abolition victory. Sommersei Democrat. Arresting Coppekheads. The "Govern ment" is' si ill engaged, gone branch of it at i least, in arresting 'copperheads" not men who labored and voted to'secure the elec tion of Gen.

NEWS. From the Daily Age of Dec. 1th There is no change announced in Gen. Sherman's posiiion No arrivals are re ported from Hilton Head or Savannah, and consequently no nevs has come. Sher man's cavalry are near Savannah, and have cut the railroads leading out of it. His in fantry, however, are still some distance from the city. We shall have to wait for additional intelligence from Sherman, ery day's delay in his march allows Ev- i to Confederates to strengthen Savannah. From Petersburg we ha- e only the usual reports of picket firing and supposed ag gressive movements of the two armies. The Confederates state that General Gram is building wir.'er quarters, and that the huts can be plainly seen from their lines. They extend from ihe Appomattox River for soveral mile south past Petersburg to the Weldon Railroad, and are constructed some distance to the rear of the Federal fortifications. Nearly all the limber near Petrsburg has been cut down for these huts and lor firewood. As Grant has but lately begun building barracks on an ex tensive scale, it is thought that he has given up Ihe idea of an early attack npon Rich mond, and has no intention of moving from bis present positioa, south ol Pejersburg.. General Lee has made a report of the re sult of Gen. Gregg's recent expedition to S'ony Creek, on tbe Wetdon Railroad Gregg burned the buildings at the station, and captured ooe hundred and twenty-five Confedera'e prisoners. Oi his retreat he was attacked and followed by the Con fed erates, who captured some ol his men. Several dead and wounded were abandoned in the road x behind him as he marched. The Federal report of this expedition has alreadv been printed. General Lee has made a report of Gen Rosser's recent raid opon the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New Creek. His lo s was two killed and three wounded He captur ed seven hundred and fifty Federal prison ers, five cannon, fifteen hundred horses and mules, two iuudrd wagons, filteen hundred head of cattle, and many small arms. A large-amount of property wa destroyed. Some of Ihe cannon were siege guns, too heavy to le removed, and were spiked .General Sheridan's army i still at Win chester. He is doing nothing and the Con federates at S rasburg are as tytinl as h is Sheridan has lately sent a cavalry expedi tion, nn.ler General Merr'nt, into the Loo don Valley . eat of the Shenandoah.

From the Isthmus ol Panama we have intelligence thai the men who attempted to seize ttie California- xteamer some time since, are confined on board the ship Lan caster, al Panama. The Government of the State ol Panama refuse to allow them be taken across the Isthmus and brought to the North, until the permission of the Government ol the Columbian Siates for their extradition is firt obtained. We have no intelligence from General his pro received Sherman, and can give no n gress. Not a despatch has since our last isue. All is quiet at Petersburg ws of been A few sma'l skirmishes are the only signs of activity. From the Dai'y Age vj ike 9'h inst We have very linle intelligence this morn ing, General Sherman's main body was heard from on December 2d. At that time it wa al Milieu, seventy eight miles north west ol Savannah. Several cavalry expedi tions bad been sent towards the sea coast, bnt none of them appeared :o have gained any very important information, and al! had been recalled to the main force. Sherman seemed undecided what to do. He had been in the neighborhood of Millen for sev era! days without making any marked ad vance in any direction. Savannah did not seem, at that time, to be rnccu threatened, nor was it certain that Sherman intended to march there. Darien, near the Georgia const, at the mouth ol the Abamaha, is now thought to be ihe place lo wbicn he will go In Kast Tenneee ther have been some movements ; the Federal troops tro-n Curn rerland Gp, as has been already stated, marched toward Knoxviile. It appears that they have reached there,, but thai the j Confederates have also advanced again, and j that no v the Fed-ral outpo-ts are not more j than fi'teen miles east ol Knoxviile, lhoe j of the Confederates being jnst beyond. Gen-j eral Stor.eman i reported to be in com mand at Knoxviile. There is little change in the. position ol affairs al Na-hville Forrest i reported to have crossed the Cumberland Rivr. The Confedeaate9 have plan'ed batteries on ihe rier. fourteen miles lelo Iavi!le, and on Wednesday several gunboats were tent to dUlodge them" The gutibnals were re pnlsed. A reconnoitsance yesterday, in the direction of NoUnsville, about twelve miles southeast of Nashville, discovered a con siderable body of the enemy The Confederate have recently made a raid ir.lo Western Virginia. Colonel Witch er, the commander, reports havng captured one hundred horses three hucdred neel cat'le, and one cannon. He bnrr.ed two steamboats anil two block hou?, aud des troyed three trrts. He lost two men. From the DaVy Age of the 101k inst." It is at length definitely ascertained that General Sherman, alter effecting a junction ot his two columns at Miliedgeville. pro ceeded -lowly eastward alor.g ihe .Macon and Savannah Railroad to Millen. He was near there on Nov. 29. Some lime previous ly be had sent out a cavalry expedition, which proceeded from Miliedgeville down the Oconee, to where it falls into the Alia maha. The cavalry went within thirty miles of the seacoast, and then turned north east towards the Savannah River. The exact lins of march of this cavalry party is not known ; but, on Decemter 1 it was about 40 miles northwest of Savannah. A reconnoitering party was sent from it .tow ards Savannah, which penetrated to a point about six miles oo't of town, on the night of ! Dece-nt'er 1, and then returned to the main j body This main force then marched back i lo Sherman's camp, which, on December 2, was at Millen. A long detour to Ihe west ward hd lo be made to reach the camp. ; The time of (he return rf the cavalry is not known ; nor is any Recount given of Ihe damage done by them on their march through southeastern Georgia. It was the movements ol this cavalry force that occa sioned ihe reports of Sherman's advance being near Savannah. . It appears that on December 1, the Con federates evacuated MiJIen, and that on the 2d Sherman entered il. No contest was fought between him and the Confederates. When at Millen he was about one hundred miles Irorn the Bea-coast. O t the 3d he is reported as having begun a slow "march from Millen in a southern or southwestern direc ion. His destination is not accurately known, but'he teems lo be advancing more in the direction of Darian or Brunswick than Savannah. These two towns are near the sea-coast, south of Savannah. A transport with mails lor Sherman's army, left Wash ington on Thursday, under sealed order. The large fleet of transports with" food and ammunition for Sherman, which has been j at anchor at Fortress Monroe lor so long, is believed also to have sailed on Thursday. The Administration, however, only guesses al Sherman:s destination. It now has no better channels of information than i hm public.

They crossed over and marched down the southern bank until toint oooosite the canal was reached ! The Codederae sharpshooters were driven on anc the negroe Degan entreuctnng During the night a rifle pit was dug, and on Thurday morning ihe position wrs tecure Very few men were killed or wounded on either side A the Confederate force was eucres(ul in stopping labor on ihe canal, by breaking the drudging machi les, it is mw to be seen b '.hfr Grant will replace j.the machines and renew the Ubor Iree from moiestation.

THE Prosid-ntiaT conies' just cloel consigns the political destinies of the peo ple of the United State, during another term ol years, to Ihe control of President Lincoln of the North, and Jefferson Davis) at the. South. The Democratic party, always indent! fied with the prosperity, growth, and glory of the republic, may point wiih honest pride to its record in this great contest. Against an administration wielding the most enormous power of patronage' and he most unlimited command of treasure ever poisessed by any government, atid reinforced alike by the unbounded fears of many patriots and Ihe sympathies of all traitors, the Democra'.ic parly fought tiPe battle of r64 firmly and fearlessly to ilia end. Dfeated in the electoral college, the small majority of popular votes by whicli ii ha b"en so defeated Is demonstrably less lhan the nnmbtr of persot s. openly and officially dependent npon the aodrain s tration a office holders or contractors in the various departments of the public ser vice. But the result is against n. The Law continues to be administered by men who not only violate its exress provisions, but invade also those personal and civil rights so high and sacred that Constitutions can not confer but only guarantee them, and l which laws are made to vindicate and guar-i. ine rurse is suir uorne oy men who in four years have heaped opon os and the unborn generations of onr children a debt a'moat as huge as thai of England, acquired through centuries, and whose policy of a bloated paper currency doubles upon us the pret-ent burden of this gigan tic indebtedness. The Sword is still wield ed by those who see treason in an olive branch, and who make victories won by our gallant armies and fleets fruitless, inc they open no path to the triumphs of peace. Democrats must await events They can now only watch for the public safety, and exert all the power of a great minority to prevent Mr. Lincoln's adminis tration from drifting, lor the take of aboli tion, intc a disunion peace. 'They also serve who only stand and wait" The principles of the Democratic oanv I are just, and will yet prevail, for Ihey are the laws of the progress ol ihe human rare, j They are the piinciples which have emerg ed trom eveiy revoiu io.i ot ttie Anglo- Saxon race with increased guarantee and urentgb ! yer.- ot Ptie comiric lour years are lo be calamity. But now they who sowed the wunl are to te reaper of th I wviirrwind. The Democratic party is horn j oi pwer, uui u ine-ieu m an reponi. I bility. When the hour of sore distress I ccmes,the people, instead of cur-ing iha I Democratic party, will to it foi relief, snj ' cling to it for deliverance I Often, during t ie past year, Th j lYorld has been made lo fel th-i heavy hand of arbritary power.
