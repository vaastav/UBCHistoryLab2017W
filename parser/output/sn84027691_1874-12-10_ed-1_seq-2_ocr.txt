A country weekly makes its money on sub fcrii.tion, county patronage and other adver ting. TnETiMEs' receipts come principally from its advertising ptironage. The value of The Times a? an advertising medium de pend wholly upon the extent of Its circula tion. It i, therefore, a plain, straight li'L-i-ness proposition that the interests of The Times demand that its circulation be in creased among the people to the greatest number possible To accomplish this a low mbcriptioo price for The Times is fixed : $5.00 ier annum for the Daily, and $1.00 per allium for the Weekly. These low prices have lieen in force for nearly two years. The kesclt is that THE MAIL.

The Goven.mcnt advertising of The TiMi,for the yeir 1874, has been much lcs than one thousand dollars. The Advo cate will, therefore, fee that it is in error on that ioint. The principal source of revenue is from legitimate business advertisers, as the Adro- futt will see by reference to the columns of The Timls. The Time was bought nearly four years ago, by iU present proprietor, as a business investment. We are glad to be able to say tiiat it has proved a profitable one The Times is a paying paper, indrndent of all political considerations, and therefore staiiiK upon a sound financial basis. Tnf.

AUDITOR WILDEE'S BEP0BT. "We intend, from time to time, to examine and make our report upon Wildcrs ninety six page. In so long a statement, it is no wonder there are some errors found. The one to which wc would call particular at tention is tie one in reference to the de funct Home Insurance Company of Topeka. The Auditor says of this Company : "Either this law (the insurance law) is good for nothing to "protect the people, or this is a false certificate of good character. For it is certain that the Home Company of Topeka never had any capital, as every tody cxcoiit the framcrs of this law understand the word capital, and Otver had any bot tom. Its mortgages were worthless; its stockholders were swindled, and the Com pany was rotten from stem to gudgeon." The truth is, the main features of the in surance law arc good. It is nearly like the "cw York State law. Mortgages are con sidered everywhere good security for insur ance capital. Host of the New York com panies are founded upon mortgage invest ments. Connecticut companies have generally befn organized upon stock notes, and they are certainly not as good as mort gages. Our recollection of the "Home" is that, the stockholders were mostly Tanners, who, in order to get their property insured at low rates, and being deluded with the idea that insurance companies were making enormous profits, concluded to organize a company. They did so by mortgaging their farms and placing the new company in the hands of inexperienced men. Their hopes of enor mous profits were not realized the Home lost money. They made assessments upon the stockholders to pay their losses. The Fpckholdcrs did not take stock for that pur pose they declined to pay. The validity of their mortgages were tested in the courts the money was collected ; the losses of the Home were paid, and even the outstanding risks of the company were re-insured in the Brewers Insurance Company of Milwaukee. We fail to see any swindle in this. It may be that the stockholders made no money, but hundreds of companies before them had the same experience. The stockholders then, only paid that which they had agreed to pay, when they subscribed for the stock and mortgaged their farms. It would seem, then, that "the mortg-tges' were good enough to pay the debts of the company, and that was just what they -were given for. They 'were not "worthless," and the company was not "rotten from stem to gudgeon." From our knowledge of insurance matters, and we have had some thirty-Tears experi ence, the Home, if we are correctly inform ed, had ample security, with good manage ment, to have made a success, instead of a miserable failure. .So matter how good a capital the Home might have bad, with inexperienced insur ance men to control it, failure woald have been inevitable. Fiill not Mr. Wilder see from tie above, that hk report may tend to do harm to the insurance interests of our State? In our humble judgment, that branch of business needs the fceteriag care and protection f oar State government as much as any other business... We fear trouble will come from the publication of tatemeuta not, in reality,; true. HOW THEY ABE PAH). A great many people have wondered why the Chicago Jnler-Otan, St. Louis Globe and Leavenworth Times can afford to take sub scriptions for their resiective weeklies at one dollar each. In consequence of this low price for such large pajiers, complaints are entered against the country weeklies for keeping up the old price of $ ,9t'. There are two reasons why the city dailies, and more especially thoe referred to, can solicit eiilrtiiMrm at lower rates than the coun- txv week v can Firt, it is an easy task to transfer matter from the daily to the form in wnich the weekly matter is locked before printing, thus saving nearly all the coupo sition required lor it, which is about two thirds the entire cost of the weekly, the press work and the cost of the blank paper con stituting the other third. The cost of com position varies from 30 to 50 cents per 1,000 "ems," making the cost ler column of read ; matter ramre from S2.00 to 3 00, more or less, the co-t being governed by the length of the column, size of type nsed, a d the price paid per "lO."1 It is a very cheap wav, then, to reproduce matter with out resetting it. That mode of saving is le gitimate enough and is practiced by nearly everv daily in existence, and as a rule, with out lowering the price from the standard figures. Second, the more influ ential rarty papers have to be scatter ed.broadcast over the country for two years previous to a Presidential campaign, and four years thereafter, to facilitate which the Government kindly comes up in the rear and says : "McCulIoch, you and Palmer, and Anthony; you good, loyal tongs that can stand it'to snatch 'with pride the glori ous record of the px'f from the liquid llames of Reform vou noble old time-semrs of the inter-Ocean, Leavenworth 1 imes and St Louis Democrat, snecyou have been so faith ful over a lew thousand dollars, you shall le made the possessors of many thousands, and in this wav: put the price of your week lies down to $1, and Uncle Sam will foot the lull in makim? un tlie other dollar. This is the way in which a Radical Gov ernment remembers its mules who work and sweat in the harness and ui.der the lash, for Govmiment fodder. The Inlcr-Occan, how ever, kicked over the traces last winter, on the currency question, and the old Chicago 'Irtbune will hereafter go at the end of tlie la'-h as the overseer, Grant plies its tickling braid. So well is tins understood this as sistance from the people's great pocket that the papers themselves lxjast of ihe high estimation in which they are held at Wash ington, and how well they are paid by the Washington eagles, who know so well how to feed the eaglets. llimratha Adrancc ASEHSIBtEMOTE. Tlie Lawrenic Journal has finally ab sorbed the Tribune, which, after this date, is no more. This leaves the Journal the only morning paier in Lawrence. Mr. Thacher is to be complimented on the fact. Here after he can reasonably expect the Journal will be a profitable investment. Tiic change is not only advantageous to Mr. Thacher, but it is a God-send to the iople of Iiw rence, They will not now be obliged to half-support two papers, but can give the morning Journal such material aid in the way of good, fat advertising as to enable Brother Thacher to give them the bertpa Ier in the State always excepting The Times. Wc most heartily congratulate the Journal, and trust the future will see it one of the prosjwrous papers in the West. nHDOUT. Tins is the way that Gen. B. F. B. greeted "Gideon" on his return to Washington: I caught Butler against a closed door in the corridor of Willard's, and asked him his idea of the curious results of the recent election. "You are a newspaper correspon dent?" he snorted interrogatively. I nod ded an alluring assent. "You are anxious to know what I think atmut the elections ?" Another nod. "Then why in h-1 don't you find out ?" was his gratifying rejoinder, as he rolled himself through the door and surged up the street POST-OFFICE CHARGES In Kansas during the weekending Dec 5, 187-J, furnished by Wm.

BESIONED. Gen. Champion Vaughn has resigned his position on the Denver Tnlune, and Henry Ward has now the editorial management of the paper. The newspapers are beginning again to give the details of some of Weston's pedes trian feats. If he could only be persuaded to walk out of the country it would be a pleas ant task to give the details of his exploit- But it would certainly be an agreeable re lief if the telegraph would once for all cease to recount his movements. A more insuf ferable humbug has scarcely ever afflicted the public Brother Hammond appears to be hav ing a hard time of it at Gilcsburg, Illinois. Theodore F. Price arose in a meeting the other night and denounced tl.c good Ham mond as a ranting hypocrite and a pious pretender. The great iron-master of Detroit, E.B. Ward, Ls looked upon as the probable suc cessor of Senator Chandler in the United States Senate He is a staunch Republican and Protectionist. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Senate and House tJ Jiepratnlatiret: Since the convening of Corgress, one year ago, the Xition has undergone a prostration in busintsi and industries such as has not been witnessed with us for many years. Speculation as to the causes of this pros tration, might be indulged in without profit, because as many theories would be advanced, aa there would ba independent writers, those who expreiscd their own viewi without bearing upon the subject. Without indulging in theories as to the cause of this prostra tion, I will only cull your attention to the fact of one question, as to which it would skb, there should be no disagreement. Dur ing this prostration, two cssentiil elements ol prosperity have been mojt abundant, 

LABOR AND CAPITAL. Both have been largely unemployed, where security has been undoubted, and capital ht b. en attainable at very modera'e rates, and where labor hai been wanted, it hat been found in abundance, at cheap rates, compared with what necessaries and com forts of life could be purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements, of procpsrity, therefore, have not been de nied us. A third might be added. Oar SOTLAKD CLTMATX are uncqalled, within the limits of any con tiguous territory, under oee nationality, for its varieties proaucu 10 leea ana clothe a people, and in the amount of surplus to spare to feed less favored people, and therefore, with these facts in view, it seems to me that wis suteaasaaship at this session of Congress would dictate ignoriag the past, and direct ing in proper channel, these great elements of prosperity to our people. THK BKSX ABROAD is the only element that can, wiih always a sorbs! carrreacy, eater into osr afisirs to ciase any coatinatsl deprestioB in the- in dustries sad prosperity of our people, and i great conflict for National existence, mad a jiesMiT far temporary parpo s tHejrsisissr ofmoaey, from whatever source attainable. It may have been accessary in the wisdom c4 Congress, aad I do ant dombt their wis dom in the premiss, regtrdtag the necessity oftaetisstodeviMaaMtjorcarreacy, which proved to ha imnossihls to kaen m a psrwkhlheisuatsiassloiiimiij of theciv- ilizd world. This begat a spirit of rpecu Htion,involving an extiavaeance and luxuiy not itquired for the hjp,-it.e- or p'O pwiiy of a p'cle, nl invclving both dir-ctly tnd indirectly, foreign indtbtednew. Tue cur rency, being of a fluctuating value, and therefore untafe to hold for ljji imale tran--actioiis r quiring money, became a mt'jfct f mir-cnUuo- in it-elf. T' ese two caus have involved as in a foreizn mdebisd i.t, c Miiril in good fiith byhorrower nd leader, which shoul 1 be paid io coin, acd according to the bom! agrsed n:on when the dsbt was contracted, gold or its tqnival ent. Thigood Jaith of the Goernment cinr.ot be violated towsrds creditors, at the risk of Xa'.ionai d is; rice. OCR COHMEECE ehould be jneouraged, American ship-baild-mg and carrying, partly increased, foreign market sought for. products of the soil, and minnlactunes, to the end that we may be able ta div these debts. Where a market cin be created for the sale of our products, either of the soil or manufactory, a new means is dMcovered of utilizing our idle ca pital and labor to the advantage of Ihe whole lople; but, in my judgment, the first s'ep toward this object i to secure a currency good wherever civilizaticn reigns, one which, it it comes superabundant wiih one people, will find a market with some other; a cur rency which has ai its bais the labor necee sary'to produce it, which will giTe its vilue. Gold and silver are now the recognized me diums of cxchange.the civilized world over, and to thii we should return with the least practicable delay. SPECIE rAYMEXT. In view of the pledges of the American Canerera when our nresent Iceal tender sys tem was adopted and oar debt contracted, there should be no delay, certainly no un nectswry delsy in fixing by legislation a method by which we will return to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your special attention: I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanent rtvial of business and Industrie until a lolicy ia adopted with the legislation to car ry it out. . . Locking to a return to specie bssi, it is esy to conceive that the debtor and sp?cu Utive classes may think it of value to tbem to make the so-called money abundant, un til they can throw a portion of tbeir burdens upon other. But even if a course should be pursUtd which will keep in doubt the value ol the legal tender medium of ex cbanee, a revival of the production and in dustries is needed by all classes, by none more than the holders of prop rty of whit-.-vtr son, with debts to lumidati, for a realization upon its siles B'it admittirg that these two classes of citizens are to be benefitted by expansion, would it be honeot to give it; wruld not theg'nere! losi be too Kteat to justify such reliel? Would it not be jut as honest and prudent to authorize each d-Mor to i-sue bis own legal tenders to the extent of his liabilities, than to do it thus? Would it not be safer for fear of over-is'Uts, -y unscrupulous creditors, to say t hat all dfbt obligHtions are obliterated in the United States, and now we commenc? anew; each possessing all that he has at the time, free from incumberarce? This? propositions are too absurd to re enteriianed for a moment, by thinking people. Every delay in prepar ation for final resumption partakes of this dishonesty, and is only leas in degree, s the proposion is held out. A convenient seison will st last arrive for the good work of re deeming our pledges to commerce. It will never come, in my opinion.except by a posi tive action of Consrress, or by national dis asters, which will destroy, for a time at least, the credltof individuals antl theStateat large. A sound currency most not be reached by total bankruptcy and credit of integrity of the nation and individuals. I believe it is in the powerol Congress, at this session, to devise such legislation as will restore con fidence, revive all the industries, and start us on the career of prosperity; and to save the credit of the nation and of the people, steps toward the return to a specie bais, are the great requWtes to lhi, devoutly to be sought for, and there are others which I may touch upon hereafter. A nation dealing in a currency below that of specie in value, labors un Jer two great disidvantages : Firt, hav ing no ue for the world's acknowledged medium of exchange sold and silver. These are DKIVEX OCT OF THE COUKTRT, because there is no demand for their ue. The medium of exchange being of a fluctua ting value, for it is only worth just what it will purchase of gold and silver metals, having an intrinsic value just in proportion to the honest labor it takes to produce it here. A large margin must be allowed for profit by the manufacturer and producer. It is months Irom the date of production to the date of realization. Interest upon cap ital must be charged, and risk of fluctuation in the value of lint which is to be received added; hence high prices, acting as a pro tection to the foreign producer, who re ceives nothing in exchange lor the product of his skill and labor except a currency good at a staple value the world over. It seems to me that nothing is clearer than that the greater part of the burden of existing pros tration for the want of a sound financial sjstem falls upon the working man, who must, alter all, produce the wealth and the salaried man who superintends and con ducts business. The burden falls npon them in two ways : by the depreciation of em ployment, and by the decreased purchasing power cf their salaries. It is the duty of Congresi to devise the method of correcting the evils which are acknowledged to exist, acd not mine. But I will venture to sug gest two or three things which seem to me as absoluttly neccsjary to a RETURN TO ErECIE PAYMENTS. The first great requisite in a return to prosperity is, that the legal tender clause to the Its authorizing the issue ol currency oy the National Government should be repeal ed, to take effect as to all contracts entered into after a day fixed in the repealing act, not to apply, however, to the payment of sala ries bT the Government, or other expensfs cow provided by the law to be paid in cur rency. In the interim pending between the repeal and finil resumption, provision should be made by which the Secretary of the Treasury can obtain gold, as it may be necessary from time to time, from the date when specie resumption commenced. To this might, and should be added, a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenees, to insure an accumulation ot gold in the Treasury to sustain redemption. I commend this sub ject to your careful consideration, believing that a lavoraoie solution is auainauir, ana that if reached by this Congress, that the present and future generations will ever gratefully remember it a their deliverer from a thraldom of evil and disgrace. With resumption, 

FREE BASKIICO may be authorized with safety, giving full protection to bill-holders which they have under existing laws. Indeed, I would re gard free banking as essential. It would give proper elasticity to the currency. As .more currency should le required for the transaction of legitimate business, new banks would be started, and in turn banks would wind op their business, when it was found there was a superabundance cf cur rency. THE TBUTIX TO DECIDE. The experience and judgment of the peo ple can best decide just how much currency ta required for the transaction of the busi ness of the country. It is unsafe ta leave the settlement of this question to Concress, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Exec utive. Congress should make the regula tions nnder which banka should exist, but should not make banking a monopoly, by limiting the amount of redeemable paper currency that shall oe authorized, bucn importance do I attach to this subject, and so earnestly doT commend it to your atten tion, that I give it prominence by introdu cing it at the beginning of this message. rOSBXGX RBXATIOXS. During the past year nothing has occur red to disturb the general friendly and cor dial relations of the United Slates with other powers. The correspondeBce sub mitted herewith, between this Government and its diplomatic representatives ia other countries, shows a satisfactory condition of all questions between the United States and the meat of those countries, and with few exceptions, to which reference is hereafter made, the absence of any points of differ ence to be adjusted. Ihe notice directed by the resolution of Congress of Juce 17tb. 1874, to be given to terminate the conven tion ol July 17th, 1848, between the United States and Beg:um has been given, and the treaty will accordingly terminate on the first day of July, 1875. This Con vention reward to certain Belgian vessels.en tering the ports o' the United States, excep tional privileges which are not accorded to oar vessel. Other features of ihe conven tion have proved atisfac:ory,asd have trad ed to the caltivatioa of motoally beaeficial commercial intercourse and friendly rela tions between the two coaatriss. I hope that the negotiations which have been in vited will resalt ia the adaption of another treaty, which may tend to the interests of - -a !? yitflm GOQBKhOL OCR BKUTTOW WITH CHOtl. coBtiasjetohe friendly. Daring the peat ysarthe fear ef j wlililitT wtaiesi Chiaa aaa Ji orthelsadiacoTsai armed 'ores landing on the Island of For mosa, by th litter, his occasioned uneai msa. It i earnely hoped, hoever, that the difficulties arising fioai this CiU-, will be adjured, nd that it e advance cf cviliz--tion in these empires may noi be reianled by a sate of war. In confequenca of the ptrt taken b certain citizens of the Unred States in thi expedition, our rpresntatives in those coon'rie have been in raced to impre-s up n ihf Governments of China and J j pan the firm intention of this country to maintain s'.rict tcatrali'v in the event of ho-tilities, and carefully prevent any infrac tion of the law en lh- part of our ciiizm. In connection with this sal ject, I call the at ention of Congte to a generally conceded fact, that the grest proportion OF CHINESE EMIGRANTS, who come to our shores, do cot come volun tarily to make their homes with u, and their labor productive of general prosperity, but cime under contract with head men, who own taem, absolutely. In a'worse lorm docs this apply to chir.ete women. Hardly a perceptible per centime of them perform any honorable labor, but they ure brought for shameful purposes, to the disgrace of the communities where thev settle, acd to the creat demDrlizttion of the youth of thoe localities. If this bad practire can be legi la'el agsiat, it will be my pleasure, as well as duty, to enforce any regulation to secure so desiiable an end. NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN. It is hoped that negoliations between the Government ol Japan, and the other power". looking to the farther opening of the e mriir;, and to the removal of variou? restric'ions upen trade and travel, may soon produce Ihe results desired, which cannot fail to Inure to the benefit of all puties. Having, oa pre vious Decisions, submitted to the considera tion of Congress, the propriety of the releae of the Japanese government Irom the iurtn er pavment of indemnity, under the Conven tion of Oct. 22, 1SG6, end as no action had been taken thereon, it tecme my duty to regard this obligation of the Convention, as in fore?. As theothcr powers interested have received their portion of indemnity in all, the ministers of the United States, at Japan, have been notified that this government will receive the remainder due to the United States, under the Convention of Siminsky., I submit the propriety of applying the in come of a nirt. if not tre whole, of this fund to the education in the Japar.cs; Ian uuarre ofa number of young men, to be un iter obligation to serve the Government for a specified torm as interpreters at the lega tion and consulates. A limited number of Japanese youths might at the sime time be educated in our vernacular, ami it wouiu ie ult in a great benefit to both Governments. The importance ol bavins our own citizens i-ompeteiit and familiar with the language of Janan. to act as interpreters and other ca tmciiies connected with the legation and nsulate in that country, cannot readily be overestimated. CLAIMS AGAINST TIIE UNITED STATES. The amnu.t awarded i the Government of Great Britain bv the Mixed Commi-sion, organized under the ars of the treaties of Washington, in the settlement ot the claims of British supjecv, arising (rem acts com mitted between April lSb'l, and April 9, 1863, became practicable under the terms ot the treaty within the past year, and was paid on the 21st day of September. 1874. In this connection I renew my recommendation made at the opening of the Iait reion of Congre", that a Special Court should be created to heir and determine all claims ol aliens against the United Mates, arising from actB committed against the persons, or property, during the insurrection. It ap- l ears equitable that the opportunity should be affixed for persons of o.her States to pre sent their claim, as well as to those Jintiati subjects wliOfe claims are not admissible un der the late Commission, to the early deci ion af a competent tribunal, and I recom mend the necessary legislation to organize a Court to dispose of those claims of aliens, who are referred to in an equitable and satit factory m inner, and to so retrive Congress and the Departments from the consideration of these questions. COLONY OF NEW FODNDLASD. The legislation neccsary to exten 1 the Colony of Newfoundland, certain articles of the Treaty ot ashmgton, ot the but day ol May, led, having been had, a protocol to that enect was suggested in betMlt ol the United States and Great Britain, on the 28 ih day of May last, and was duly pro claimed on the following day. A copy of Ihe report of the report of the Commissioner appointed under the act ot March vj, iSiZ for surveying and making a boundary be tween the United S'ates and tirilish pos sessions from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Kocky Mountains is here with transmitted. I am happy to announce that the field work of the Commissioner has been completed, ana the enure line, from the northwest corner of the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Monn tains, has been run and marked upon the surface of the earth. It is believed that the amount remaining unexpended of the? ap' propria:ion made at the last session of Con gress, will be sufficient to complete the work. I recommend that the authority of Congress be given to the use of the unex pended balance of the appropriation on the completion of fhe wotk of the commission in making the report and printing the neces sary map. The coUit known as the Couit of Commissioners of ALABAMA CLAIMS, created by an act of Congress at the last ses sion, has organized and commenced the work and it is to be hoped that the claims admis sible under the provision of the act, may be speedily administered. TURKEY. It has been deemed advisable to exerci'e the descretion conferred upon the Lxecutive at the last session, by accer.ting the conditions required by the Government of Turkey, for the privilege of allowing citizens of the United btates to hold real estate in the former country, and by assenting (o a certain change of the juris diction of the courts in the latter. A copy of the proclamation upon these subjects is herewith communicated. There is no material change in our rela tions with the independent States within this hemisphere which were formerly under tbe dominion of Spain. MARAUDING ON TIIE FRONTIER, between Mexico and Texas still frequently takes place, despite the vigilance of civil and military authorities. In that quarter, the difficulty of checking such trespasses along the course of a river, of such length as the Rio Grande, and so often fordable, is obvious. It is hoped that tbe effects of this Government will be seconded by those of Mexico, to the effectual suppression of acts of wren;;. From a report upon the condi tion of business before tbe American and Mexican Joint Claims Commission, made by the agent on the part of the United States, and dated October 28ib, 1874, it appears thatol tbe 11,107 claims filed on the part of citizens of the United States, 481 had been finally decided, and 75 were in the hands of the umpire, leaving 483 io be disposed of; and of ihe 990 claims filed againat Ihe Uni ted States, 72C had been finally decided on. One was before the Umpire and 271 re main to be disposed cf. Since the date ot such report, other claims have been di-pos-ed of, reducing somewhst the number still pending, and others have been parsed npon by the arbitrators. It has became apparent, in view ol these figures, and of the fact that the work devolving on tbe Umpire is par ticularly laborious, that the Commission would be unable to dispose of the entire number of claims pending prior to the first day of February, 1875, the date fixed for its expuaiion. Negotiations were pending looking to the securing oi toe results oi the decisions which have been reached, and to a farther extetsion of the Commission for a limited time, which it is confidently hoped will suffice to bring all tbe business now be fore it to a final close. THE STRIFE IH THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC is to be deplored, both on account of the parties thereto, and from the probable effects OB ine laicrca un utuev w iuc uiiuv in iu quarter, of whom the United Su'es are among the principal.

It is with regret that 1 announce NO FURTHER PAYMENT OF YENEZECLA, on account of tbe war, in favor of the Unit ed Sutes. Hopes have been entertained that if the Kepeblic could escape both foreign and civil war for a few years, its great national resources woald enable it to nnaor its obliitaliots.

Formerly, amid con flicting opinions acd divisions, it was diffi cult to exactly determine how far the doc trine of perpetual allegimce was appliachle lotitzjnsof the United Slates. Congress, by the act of the 27th of July, ISGS, asserted the abs'ract right cf expatriaiim as a funda mental principle of the corernmeiit. Not withstanding such assertion, red the neces sity of frequeut applications of the principle, Lolei-lation hus been bad, defining acts, or whether a citizen shall be deemed to have re nounced, or lo have lost his citizenship. The importai.ee of such a definition isobviou. The representatives of the Unite l S:ates, in foreign conntrie', are continually called up on to lend their aid, and the protection of the United States, to persons, concerning the good faith or the reality of who citizen ship there is at least grat question. In eome cases, the provjs'on of the treaties fur-ni-h some guide; on others, it seems Jeft to the persons claiming the benefit of citizen ship, while living in a foreign country, con tributing in no manner to the performance of the obligations and duties of a citizen of the United States; simply as a shield from the performance of the obligations of a citi zen, elsewhere the status of children born of American parents, residing in a foreign country; cf American women, who have married aliens; of American citizens, re--iJ-irg abroad, where euch a question ii not regulated by treaty, are all source! of fre quent difficulty and discu-sion. Legislation on these, and similar questions, and partic ultily bearing, when and under what cir cumstances expatric, can be accomplished, or is to be presume J, is especially needed. Io this connection I earnestly call the atten tion of Congress to the difficulties arising from fraudulent naturalizttion. The United Stales wisely, freely and liberally offers its citizenship to all who may cou.e in good fsith io reside witlin its binders on their cjmilying with cert in prescribed rea-oa.ible and simple formalit e, and conditions. Among the hghest duties of the Government is that to afford free atd equal protection to all its citiz;n', wl ether native-born or natnr.ilized. Cire should Le taken that a righ', carrying with inch suppoit from the Government, should not be tnudulently obtained, and should be bestowed otdy upon full proof of a compliance with the law. There are frequent instances of illegal and fradulent caturalizition, urn! of rettifisites thin im properly acd fraudulently obtainel. In Fome ra ei the fraudulent character of the natural zition has appeared upon the face of ihe certificate itself. On others, exami nation discloses that tie bolder had not complird with the law. In others the cer tifica'es have been obtained when toe per sons holding them not only were not entitled to be naturalized, but had not even been within the United Stales at the lime of their pretended naturalizition Instances of each of these elates of fraud are discover ed at our legations where Ihe certificites of naturalizition are presented, either for the purpose of obtiintng passports or in de manding tbe protection of the legation. When the fraud is apparent on the face of such certificate, they are taken up by the representative! of the Government and for warded toj the Department of State, but even the record of the court in which the fraudulent naturalization occurred remain", acd duplicate certificates are readily obtainable. Uion the presen tation of the;e for tli3 issue of p imports, or demindii'g protection of the Government, the fraud sometimes escapes notice, and such certificates are not unfrtquently us-h! to the injury of innccent parties. Without plac ing any additional obstacle in the way of the obfainment of citizenship by tbe worthy and well intentioned foreigner, who comes in good faitb, I earnestly recommend fur ther legislation to punish fraudulent natur alization of the guilty, and to secure the ready cancellation oi the record of every naturalization made in fraud. TREATIES OF EXTRADITION. Since my last anjual message, the ex change has been made of the notification of treaties of extradition with Belgium, Ecquador, Pern and San Salvador; also, of a treaty of commerce and navigation with Fero, and one of commerce and consular privileges with San Salvador, all of which have been duly proclaimed, as has also a declaration with Russia with reference .to trade-marks. TIIE RETORT OF TITE SECRETARY OF TIIE TREASURY, which by law is made directly to Congress and forms no part ef this message, will show the receipts and expenditures ot the Gov ernment tor the last fiscal year; the amonnt received from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out for each of ihe depart ments of Government. It will be observed from this report that the amount of receipts over expenditures, have been but $234,4SS,230, for ihe fiscal year ending June GO, 1S74, and that for ihe current year the estimated lectipt over ex penditures will not much exceed f 9,000.000. In view of the large National debt ext-ting, and the obligations to add to our p2r cent per annum to the a:nking fund, a sum amounting now (o over 14,000,000 per an num, I submit whether revenues should not be increased, or expenditures diminished, in order to teich this amount of surplus. Xot to provide lor the sinking fund is a par tial failure to comply with the contracts and obligations of the government. At the last session of Congress, a very considerable re duction was made in the rates of taxation, the number of articles submitted to laxi tion. The question may, and will be asked, whether or not, in someinstances, unwLely, in connection with this subject, too, the opinion that Ihe means of collecting the revenue, especially from imp-jrts, have been so embirrassed by legislation as to make It questionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to colled, to the direct loss of the treasury, and lo the prejudice of the interess of honest impor ters and tax payers. The Secretary of tre Treasury, in his repoit, favors leg islation looking to specie payments, supporting views previously expressed in this message. He also recommends econo my in apprpotialioos, acd calls the attention to the less of the revenle from repealing the tax on tea and coffee without benefit to tbe consumer. He recommends an increase of ten cents a gallon on whisky; and further, that no modification should be made in ihe bank and currency bill parsed at the last session of Congress, unless a modification should become necessary, by reason of the adoption of measures for the returning to specie payments. In these recommenda tions I cordially join. I would suggest to Congress the propriety of re-adjusting THE TARIFF so as to increase the revenue, tnd at the same time decrease the number ol articles npon which duties are levied. Those articles ol manufacture which we produce a consti tuent part of, but do not produce the whole, that part which we do not produce should enter free. Also, I will instance fine wool dyes, e c. These must be imported to form apart of the manufacture -of tbe higher grades of woolen goods, and chemicals uses' as medicine, and used ia various ways in manufactures, come nnder this class. Tbe introduction, free of dues, of such wools as we do net produce, ehould stimulate the manufacture of goods requiting these and those we do produce, and. therefore, would be a benefit to home production. There are mSny articles entering into home manufac tures which we do not produce curselves, the tariff on which increases the cost of pro duction of the manufactured article. All come iocs in this regard are in the direc tion cf bring labor and capital in harmony with each otber, and of snpplyirg oce of the elements so much needed. TRE EXPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR, herewith attached, and forming a part of this message, gives all the information con cerning all tne operations, wants ana necessi ties, and contains many suggestions acd reoomjnendstioe,whicb I commend to your consideration. There is do class of govern ment employees who are harder worked than the army officers and meo; none who per form their tasks saors cheerfully and more efficiently, and nnder difitmstaness of great er privation and hardship. Ugisiatjon k desirable to render more tgcisnt thai breBch of the public service. All the reonmnwsiik tioas of the (Secretary of War Iregard m ja dirion : and I isperiiirj cnssweasl to jossr atientiem the following: IW bfOuiui t bhssjsm; mileage. s traveling under orders; the exemption of money, rec-ived from the sa'e of subsistence store--, from betn; converted into ibe Treas ury; ibeuswot appropriations for the pur pose of subsistence stores, without waiting for the beginuitg of the fiscal year, for which the appropriation is made; for additional ap propriations for the collection of torpedo material; for increased appropriations for the manufacture of arm ; for relieving the various States from indebtedness for arms charged to ihem during the rebellion ; for dropping officeis from the rolls of the army without trial frr the offeree of drawing pay more than ence for the same period; for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by check, acd for the establishment of a profes-orship of rhetoric and English litera ture at West Point. The reasons for the rccommendatiocs are obvious, and are set forth sufficiently in the report attached. I also recommend that the status of the etafi corps of the army be fixed, where this has not already been done, so that promo'iots may be made and vacancies filled as Ihey occur ia each grade, when reduced below the number to be fixed by law. Tbe neces sity of such legislation is especially felt row in the pay deparimnt, which is telow the number adequate to Ibe performance ot the duties required of them by law. TUE NAVY. The efficieccy of the navy has been largely increased during the list year under the impulse of the foreign complications, hich threatened us af the commencement ot the last session of Congress. Most of our efficient wooden ships were put in condition for immediate service, and the repairs of our iron-clad fleet were pushed with the ut most vigor. The rctilt is that most of these are now in an effective state, and need only to be manned and set in commission and to go at once into service. Somefof the newelcops authorized by Con gress are already is commission, and most ol the remainder are launched, and await only the completion of machinery to enable them to take their places as part of the effective force. Two iron torpedo ships have Leen completed during the Isst year, and two of osr large, double-turreted iron-clads are now undergoing repairs. When these are finished, everything that is needful for our navy, as now authorized, will be in condi tion for service, and with the advance in the science of torpedo warfare, the American navy, comparatively small as it is, will be found powerful for the purpose of a peaceful i.alion. SCIENCE. Much has also been accomplished during the year in aid of science, and to increase the sum of icneral knowledge and further the interests of commerce and civilization. Exttnsivesnd mu:b needed soundings have been mads for hydrograpbic purposes, and tu fix tbe propsr route of ocean telegraphs. The surveys of the great Isthmus hava Leen undertaken and completed, and two vessels of the navy ate row employed, in coi junc tion with those of Germany, France, Eng land and Ku-sia, in ohervaiions connected with the trau-it of Venus, uelul and instruc tive to the scientific world. Estimates for this branch of ihe public service do not differ materially from these of last year. The general support of the service being somewhat Its-1, and these for improvement of the various stations, are rather larger than the corre Sj ondinz estimate made a year sgo. Tne regular maintainance and a steady inrreae io tbe efficiency of this most important arm in the proportion to the growth of our mar itime intercourse and interests is recom mended to the attention of Congrea. The use of the navy during peace might be fur ther utilized by a direct autborizsticn of the employment of naval vessels in surveys of the supp sed navigable waters of ether nationalities on this continent, especially ihe tributaries of the two great rivers of South America, the Orinoco and Amazon. Nothing pievents, under existing laws, such exploration, except that expenditures must be made in such development of cemmer c'al interests, advantageous to the people reached, and to these who may establish re lations with them. EDCCiTION OF TIIE TEOFLE entitled to the exclusive right cf frenchise, I regard esential to prosperity, everywhere, and especially so in republics, where both education and previous cendition do not en ter into account in giving suffrage. Xext to the public school', the post-efficeistbegreat agent of education. Over our vast ter ritory tbe rapidity with which new section are being; settled up, thus incr asing the cirrymg of mails in a mote rapid ratio than the increase of receipts, is not alarm ing. THE RErORTOF TDJE rOST-MASTER GENERAL herewith attached, shows that there was an increase in the revenue of his department in 1873 over Ihe previous year, ol $1,674,411, and an increase of the cost of carrying the mails, or paying employes $3,047,407.97. The report ef the Postmaster-General, gives interesting statis tics of his department, and compared with corresponding statistics of a year sgo, shows a growth in every branch of the department. A postal convention has been concluded with New South Wales, an exchange of postal cards established with Switzerland, and ne gotiations pending for severs 1 years past with France, have terminated in a conven tion with that country, which went into ef fect last August. An International Postal Congress was convened in Berne, Switzer land, in September last, at which the United States was represented by an officer of the IVst Office Department, of much experience and qualifications for the position. A Con vention for the establishment of an Interna tional Postal Union, was agreed upon by the delegates of countries represented, subject to tbe approval of the proper authorities of these countries. I respectfully direct your attention lo the report of the Postmaster General, and to his suggestions in regard to an equitable adjustment of question of com pensation to railroads lor carrying mails. Your attention will be drawn to tbe un titled condition ol affairs in some SOUTHERN STATES, on 14th of September last, the Governor of Louisiana called upon me, as provided by the Constitution and Laws of the United States, for aid in suppressing domestic vio lence in that State. The call was made, and proclamation issued on that day by D. B. Penn, stating that he was elected Lieutenant-Governor in 1872, and calling upon the militia cf tbe State to arm, asem le and drive from the power ihe usurpers, as be designated the officers of the State government. Uu the next day I is sued my proclamation commanding the in surgents to disperse wilhin five days from the date thereof, and subsequently 1 learned that, on that day, they had taken forcible possession of (he State House. Troops were taken by me to support tbe ex'sting and re cognized officers; but before the expiration of tbe five days the icsurrection movement was practically abandoned, and Ihe cfficeis of the Slate eovernment. vriih some miner exceptions, re-umed their powers snd duties. Considering that the present State adminis tration of Louisiana had been the. only gov vernment in that State for nearly two years, that it ha be n tacitly acknowledged acd acquiesod in as such by Congress, and Bore tbsn once expressly recognized by me, I re garded it as my clear duty when legally call ed npon for that purpose to prevent its over throw by an armed mob, under tbe pretence of fraud and irregularity in tbe election of 1872. I have heretofore called the a fen don of Congress to this subject, stating thai on account of the frauds and forgeries com mitted at said election, and because it appears that the returns thereof were never legally canvassed, it was impassible to tell thereby who were chosen, but from the best sources of information at my command. 1 save al way believed the present State officers recevtd a majority of the legal votes actually cast at that election. I repeat what I said in my special message, of February 13.h, 1873. that in the event of to acion by Congress, I must continue to recognize tee government heretofore recognized by me. I regret to say that with tbe preparations for the late election, a decided indication appeared ia some localities in the Southern States, of a determination, by ecu of violence and in timidation, to deprive aliseas of the free dom of tbe ballot, because of their political opinions. Bands of jmen, masked and armed, made their appearance. 

WHITE LEAGUER'S and other societies, were formed; large quan tities of aims and ammunition were import ed, and distributed to theaa organizaiiooa; military drills, with menacing demonstra tions, were held, and.with all of these, mur ders eaouzn were onuuuw u pjucaw ter ror among those whose political opinion was to be suppressed, if possible, by these intol- lereat sad criminal procecaiags. aa sosae nlaees. colored laborers were compelled to vote accordiag to ihe wLh8 of their em clovera. under threats of discharge if they voted otherwise, and there are too many in stances ia which, when these threats were disregarded, they were remorselessly ex ecuted by those by whom made. I nnderatand that the ruixxani aMEJTDMsjrr to the Constitation was made to prevent this like state of things, and the net of May 31st, 1870, with amendments, wwMeaesI tee. tetroTiBcs.thetneetessAlsiiasr to goMtrnm to til ataM she right to vote J and to protect them in the free enjoyment of that right enjoined by thr Cn-titu'ioa, and to tak-cire ihit the laws be faiihfu'ly exe cuted. I am c nvinctd by undoubted evi dence that violations of this act have been committed, and that a widespread and fla grant disregard of itwis contemplated. The proper officers were instructed to prosecute tbe offenders, and troops were stationed at convenient points to aid those officers, if necew ary, in the performance of their official duties. Com, laints are made of this inter ference by FEDERAL AUrHORITY, but if said Amendment acd act do cot pro vide for such interference, undsr the circum stances as above s ated, then they are with out meaning, forcp or effect, and the whole scheme cf colored enfranchisement is worse thsnmcckeiy and H tie bttter than a crime. Possibly, Corgre.-s may find it due to truth and justice to ajcertiin. ly means of a com mittee, whether the alleged wrongs to color ed ci'izsns for poli'ical j urposes are real, or the reports thereof were manufactured -for the occasion. Tbe whole number of troops in the States of Louisiana, Alabama, Geor gia, Florida, South Caroltm, North Caroli na, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mis sissippi, Marvhnd and Virginia, at the ttme of the election, was 4,0S2. This em braces the garrisons of all the forts from the Delaware to tlicUuIfo Mexico. ARKANSAS TROUBLE?. Another trouble has arisen in Arkansas. Article 13 of the Constitution of that State, which wai adopted in 1S68, acd upon the approval of which by Corgress the State was restored to representation, as cne of the States of the Union, provide, in effect, that before any amendment proposed to this con stitution shall become a part thereof, they shall be passed by two successive Assemblies, and then sumitled to, and ratified by, a ma jority of the electors of the State, voting therein. On the 11th of May, 1974, the Governor convened an extra session of the General Assembly oi the State, which, on the ISth of the same month, pasted an act providing for a convention to frame a new Constitu tion. Pursuant to this act, and at an elec tion held on the 3'Jlh cf June, 1874, the convention was approved and de'egates were chosen thereto, who assembled on the 14th of last July, atid framed a new Constitution. the schedule of which provided for the elec tion ot an entire new st of btate cnieers, in a manner contrary to the then existing elec tion laws ot the btate. On the iS'.h of Oc tober, 1374, SjV Cons itntion, es therein provided, wis submitted to tbe people, for their approval or rejection, and, according to the election returns, wss approved by a large majority of these qualifitd to vote thereon; and at the same election per sons were chosen to fill all the State, county and township office-. The Governor elected in 1872 for the term of four .years, turned over his office to the Governor chosen, under the new Constitution, where upon the Lieut-Governor, also elected in 187-. for a term of four yeirs, claimirg to act as Governor, anl alleging that said pro ceedings, oy which the new Constitution was made, anda new set of officer, were un constitutional, illegal and void, called upon me ft? provided in Section 4, Article 4, of the Conntuition, to protect the btate against domestic violence. As Congress is now in vestigating the political affairs of Arkansas, I have DECLINED TO INTERFERE with the subject. Executive interference with the affsirs of a S.ate, is repugnant lo public opinion, to the feeling of those, who Irom tbeir official capacity, must be used in cruel interposition acd to him, cr these who must direct, unless most clearly on tbe side omsw, such interferences rcccmes a crime, with the law to support it, he is condemned without a hearing. I desire, therefore, tbat all necessity for Executive direction in local affairs, may become uaneccs ary and obo lete, and inite attention, not cf Congres', but of people Of United States to ike causes and effects of these unhappy questions. Is there not a disposition on one side to magnify wrongs and outrages, and on other side to belittle or justify them? It public attention could be directed to a correct survey of what is right and to rebuking wrong, and aiding pro per authorities in punishing, a better state cf feeling would be indicated and the sooner would we enjoy that peace which would leave the States free, indeed, to regulate their own affairs. I believe on the part of our citizens ol Ibe southern states, tbat the letter part of Ihem are disposed to -be law abiding and do no violence either to indivi duals or tbe laws existing. But do they do right in ignoring the existence of VIOLENCE AND BLOODSHED in resistance lo tbe Constitution and laws? I sympathize with their prostrate cendition and would do all in my power lo relieve them, acknowledging that in same instates they have bad mest trying governments to live under, and very oppressive ones in the way oi taxation for nominal improvements, not giving benefit equal ta the hardships imposed. But can they proclaim themselves entirely witlicut blame tor this condition? They cannot. Violence has been rampant ia seme localities and has further been justi fied, or denied, by those who could have prevented it. The theory is rais.d that there is to be no further interference on the part of the general Government to protect citi zens within a state where the state authori ties fail to give protection. This is a great mistake; while I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution, including the recommendations added thereto will te enforced with vigor, hut with the regret that they should have added one jot or little to the Executive du ties or powers. Let there be fairness in Ihe discussion of Ihe Southern questions; the advocates of both or all political parties giving honest, truthful reports of occur rences, condemning the wrong and uphold ing the right, and soon all will be welt. Un der the existing conditions, the NEGRO VOTES the Republican ticket because he knows hi friends are of that party. Many a good citizen votes the opposite, not because he agrees with tbe great principles of S'atc, which seperate partiis, but because, general ly, he is opposed to negro rale. This is a most delusive idea. Treat the negro as a citizen and voter, as he is, and mut remain, and soon parties will be divided, not on the color, but on piinciples. Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference. THE RETORT OF TIIE ATTORNEY-GENERAL contains valuable recommendations, relaticg to the administration of justice in the courts of the United Stites, to which I invite your attention. I respectfully suggest lo Con- gresss tbe propriety of increasing the num ber of judicial districts in the United States, (the present number being nine) and the lo cation of two additional judgeshfrs. The territory to be traversed by the Circuit Judges is so great, and the business ol the rourtt so steadily incteiring, that it is grow ing more and more impossible for them to keepnp with the business requiring their at tention. Whether this would involve the necessity of adding two more justices of the Supreme Court to the present number, I submit to the judgment of Congress. The attenticn of Congress is invited to the
