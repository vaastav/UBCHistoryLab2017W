The) Horrors of War-Condition of Alsace The t'nlversal Desolation In the French Pro vinces 'The Heiowotd l-oaler, L'hrlch." A vivid idea of the sufferings and Borrows that follow in the train of war is given In the following letter from an Alsatian lady to her Bon in Newark, N. J., which is published In the Advertiser of that city. The writer Is a resident of a village about five miles out of Strasburg: Whole villages are burned down and the in habitants nrc living in the woods, having fled from their nouses on the approach of tho Prus sians. Ob; how glad I am that you did not come home lapt sprinir, as you intended to do. And what would have become of your dear wife? Yqu must know that those barbarian hordes never fail to ruin the virtues of wives and girls. Oh, what misery ! what poverty ! (Jh Joseph, you ought toj.see Strasbourg now! They capitulattd the 5th of October, and as soon as the capitulation was known everybody got deniorali.ad. Neighbors went to Pee each other, erying and embracing their friend. The soldiers broke their arms eabres and guus many a cannon was thrown into the river 111. All broke out in imprecations nuainst the re nowned looter, Uhrich, who forbade his artillery to net againct the besiegers with effect. Ou the 7th of October I ventured out in the town. What a heart-breaking view was offered to me! Whole streets burned completely down, pre senting nothing more than a heap of rains, remains of black and smoky walls, with the balf-burned furniture scattered among them, and sometimes a whole house thrown into the street, obstructing the passage. The quarter between the gate of Kroncnburg and Stein strafe, as well as the Finkmalt, are in ahes. The street of the Nuce Kleue, where you lived so long as a child, aud where you knew every one of those magnificent building, is no more ! You cannot imagine what misery ishere; everything eaten up, everything stolen and car ried away; women are iusultcd and men beaten; and the same thing is repeated every day aud every day. I had fourteen soldiers to lodge and two wounded Frenchmen; you can imagiue how well they were cared for. I had to quarrel all the time with the Prussians, but Anally got the best of them If you should come home now you would see nothing else but ruins, ashes aud desolation, and hunger aud pain in every face. And what will we do then when those heavy snow-storms come on, without food, without shelter, and con stantly pursued by those barbarian Prussians, who sing profane songs and cry "Down with the French !' as they did on the eve of the sur render of Strasburg. There Is never a kind word spoken to us poor country people; every thing is demanded with the pistol or sabre in hand. Tbey shoot down people as they would game in a great hunting expedition. 

DESOLATION EVERYWHERE. Herr Wachenhusen, writing from the vici nity f Chartres on the 15th to the Cologne Ga zette, says: The small town of Auneau, near Chartres, which had been occupied by the Germans, had been punished with a line forits connectiou with the surprise at Ablis. The Francs-tireurs, ac cording to the hotel keeper, entered the town at ii o'clock one morning with sixty captured rrusnan cavalry soldiers, aud wiahea to es tablish themselves there, but being refused any countenance by tue inbabuants, wno were tear fnl of the consequences, they retired just as the l'russians entered, lue latter searched every house, but ouly found and shot five of the band. On'y greybeards, women, and children are now to be found in the wretched villages of the Loi re t, and these are so destitute that they ouly live on what the German soldiers give them out of their rations of meat and bread. JSven the better-off families in the towns aud the country have for weeks been glad to have olticers quar tered upon them, for the ollicers are obliged to feed the inmates as well as themselves, and do so as soon as the ox Is slaughtered and the car case divided. At Anreau tbe writers host, a farmer, ex pressed a fear that the Grand Duke might meet with a mischance. He was an Orluauist, and had a great respect for the Prince. The 6auie intertbt in him was shown iu all the places wnere ne nxeu nis quarters, tne memory ot the Duke of Orleans, to whom he was related, being Held iu great esteem by tue rrencn provincials, and his death still remembered as a national disaster, "it is a disgrace." remarked the bouest farmer, "that so great a nation as ours should sins so low. vse, ot course, desire the end of the war, and hate the Prussians; but," he added, sighing, "I fear we shall still need them. and shall have to recall them in order to protect us against ourselves, for the end of the war will be but the beginning of our wretchedness. May uod save us : HOW THE BAVARIANS LIVE ON THE COCNT11Y Herr Wachenhusen states that the Bavarians and Prussians fraternize most cordially, and daring the whole campaign he has not heard of a single misunderstanding between them. The Bavarians pay great atleution to the material side of life, and with their anxiety for the menage they are a terror to the French peasants. In a village lies, perhaps, already a battalion of North German troops. All is Btill and quiet in the peasants' cottages. The soldiers are polishing their boots, stand in the open kitchens, and wash their shirts or peel their potatoes. A Bavarian column comes along the road, and suddenly there is a great commotion in the vil lage. The hens cackle, the cocks crow, . the ducks and geese cry out for help. A few minutes afterwards all is again still, but no cock crows, ne duck quacks any more, the inhabitants wring their bands over the cut-off heads of their fowls which the column has left behind. "All hope abandon," I exclaim whenever I coma through a village in which I see the Bavarians cantoned. Their philosophy, however, is the right one, and I expressly guard myself against the suspicion oi meaning ny disparagement. The Bavarians are the true war philosophers. "A la outrre comme a la guerre." PeoDle tbonld not begin a war if they do not like its disadvantages. Sine the cold has set in we see the Bavarians inarching in their winter cos tume. Every garment that fives warmth it welcome to them. They have discovered an excellent hood in the greyish blue capotes of the fallen Zouaves and jiger, whoe heir they have lliua becotue. Ou Uncles it is Ficuctl battalion on seeing the grey hoods. CUKA. Important Letter Irons President Cespedes The Htrnle HUH maintained with Hope f stneeess. The following letter, addressed to General W. McMabon by the President of the republic of Cuba, has been received: REPUBLIC OF CCBA OOI AND LIBEKTY. Camauuev. August 11, lb'il To General M. T. McMahon, President ot the Cuban league ot the United states. Sir: I htive received with the greatest pleasure your letter of the llihefMayor the present pear, Iu which you are good enough to Inform me of the organization of the Cuhau Lengtie of the I'nited Mates, of the objects of the associa tion, and of the sentiments which animate It in favor of the cauHft which we, the free men of this island, are roatutainiug. it is very gratifying and stgniu caut to the people of Cuba to know that the league as ieen establishes, ami inii yon are us wortny resident; and we hope that It will produce Import ant results for the speedy mancipation of all the slaves, both black and white, who are here fighting to secure the blessing of modern liberty, following in this th example of the American States. Believe me, (ieneral, that the Cubans have never doubted for a moment that the people of the United States are earnest In behalf of the liberty and Independence of Cuba, notwithstanding the unfortunate attitude assumed by their Government; nor that the day Is near at hand when public opinion, omnipotent in all governments purely republican, will compel the adoption of a mure natural line of conduct, and which involves no departure from the true princi ples of the great nation which your (Jovernment directs. For this reason the people of Cuba have not permitted the warmth of their sympathies with the people of the United States to be in any manner alio led. Put that which causes ns the greatest satisfaction Is the Justice which you and your worthy associates have uone us, In distinguishing the court net of the belligerent Cubans from that of tnelr Inhuman op pressors, including even those born on the soil, who light under the banners of tyranny. I swear to you on my honor that It Is fnlse, the calumny with which It Is sought to prejudice us before the Cabinet of Washington, by asserting that we have Imitated in any respect the atrocities of the Spaniards. No, a thousand times noi in tne very nrst uavs or the revolution I endeavored to moderate the hardships of the war. On a later occasion I renewed with great earnestness my etrorts towards the same end. Upon the consolidation of our Republican Uovern nicnt, It appealed again to that of Spain to abandon a practice revolting to moderu civilization, rather than oblige us to resort to measures of reprisal. No result was obtained. Silence or insult was the sole reply. It was declared we were rebels, with whom they would hold no intercourse, except by bullets. t would have been shameful to the Cubans not to chastise such insolence. Vet, iu doing so, there has ever been observed all the moderation consis tent with the stern duty impose! on us. ir any cnimn oincer or soldier, in a rew very rare cases, lius been guilty of excess in any particu lar, he has sintered immediately the penalty of df-atn ; ror our Government nas never authorised the execution of prisoners taken in arms, excent after formal trial by military court. The Spaniards, on the contrary, mutilate the dead bodies of those whom they assassinate, and direct their lusane fury against peaceful citizens, women, old in'in, and children, and hesitate not to dishonor their victius by practices most foul. The people of Cuba unite with the members of the League In the hope that these horrors will soon cease. The Spaniard will be driven from our shores, and our beautiful and beloved Island will take the place among civilized uatioas to which she has established her claim by courage and long suffering, and by the capacity for self-government; so steadily developed during her prolunged aud honorable struggle. Our people will always Hold in graterul remem brance the encouragement whtch they derive from the Cuban League of the United States, anil from the American uatlou In general, to which they are bound by so many ties of brotherhood. 1 have had the pleasure to transmit to the Cham ber of ltenresentatlves for appropriate action the orlrtnal of your courteous coiumuulcatton. riease nave ttio goodness, General, to oner to your worthy associates the assurance of my high est consideration, and receive the same tor yourself. C. 11. DE CESl'KDES. General Jordan's Latest Plan for Achieving t'ubun Independence Scheme lor Iotroduc lu an Army and Arms from the United tale. Washington, Dec. T. A new plan for the benefit oflCuba has been bruited about within a short time whir.n nas rounn many approvers, its main reatures are drawn by Gcnctal Jurflan, and the following leuer sseicnes iiieni iu cniei pari, i ney nave been approved ny Air. Aidama auu tne conspicuous per suns of the Cuban Junta, as his reply indicates. The law lords or the senate, However, shaking their hi ads, say the neutrality law of 

ISIS forbids any person within our limits to begin, or set on foot, or provide, or prepare me means lor any military expedition or enterprise wuaever against auy Spanish rule in Cuba. The intent of ueneral Jor dan's plan, they say, clearly Is to begin here, aud place in Cuba a military force armed and equipped, and that those who furnish ships or transportation provide me means ior it. The emigrants, too, It Is said, really enter them seves to go to Cuba with Intent or ia order to serve the Insurrectionists, and that Jordan's scheme is an advice that persons here assist the emigrants to go to t he island so that they can embark la the military enterprise. The Senators and members of Congress laminar wun tne lacts say mat .tor dan s piautsa repetition of the Crampton device of recruiting men for the British army In the Crimea, by inviting and inducing them to go to Canada, on payment of board, passage money, expenses, or the like, there to decide whether they will enlist for the Crimea. (General Jordan's Plan. The plan from which the following passages are taken was prepared by Ueneral Jordan in August last: The time has come when a plan of operations must be definitely settled for the approaching winter season in Cuba. My plan is simple aud of easy exe cution. AMERICAN SOLDIERS NEEDED. There are ample resources of men in the island if tbey were anted, equipped, and properly supplied with ammunition men who may be readily moulded Into an effective army if some good foreign o dicers were iutroduce ;to drill and baudle them, especially tne negroes, wno may ne inns unue excellent sol fliers, armed even in me t.ogusn language, as many rtgtments of Germans were daring fie late war in this country. But while, as 1 have suiil, there is abundance of native personnel In Cuba for an army, I am nevertheless satisfied it will be expedient that about fifteen hundred Americans should be induced to emigrate, to form the nucleus around which the native Cubans may rally aud soli lify into au overpowtrlug force; and I may say here this is the wish and the view, as 1 know, of all our people iu Cuba. I believe, too, it nitty be achieved without conflicting with the neutrality laws of the I lilted states, which, for my pan, I must say I do not uesigu 10 violate. HOW 1IKN MAY BE SllIl'I'II). In the Interview I had with Mr. Fish, I was much impressed with his character as a gentleman, aud sis sincere desire to give all lawful aid that he may to the Cubans. He assured me, Indeed, of his 'be lief that there is nothing lu the neutrality laws which can be construed lutu a hindrance of Ameri cans going to Cuba any inure thau elsewhere, pro vided they go unarmed upon a shtp whose cargo Is not contraband of war that is to say, if they go manifestly as passengers, ana not evidently at an armta military expeuiiiou, GRAND EMIGRATION SCHEME. I have a great number of applications from gentle. men of In Hue nee iu this country who wish to go to Cuba with parties to settle and live there, after bay ing assisted to free it from Hpaulsh tyranny. These persons may be informed in due season that trans. portation will be provided at certa'n places for such parties of emigrants as may be ready at the soeciUed time, aud also that subsistence and transportation will be afforded from interior points to the place or places of embarkation, but with the distinct under standing that they wUl leave this country siugly as emigrants, to become Cubans by naturalization ami entirely tree to do as taey please in Cuba upon landing there; for I repeat there must not be even an Intention, and there need not be any violation of the laws. And especially, therefore, there mutt be no offer of bounties, aua the going of the men must be absolutely voluutary or without other In dut emeut than such as may nave led Americans to em i urate from State lo Slat, and particularly to California ana oiner territories abounding iu the precious metals. I am satisfied la this way a suf ficient emigration may be Inaugurated, If managed with discretion and a proper respect and considera tion for the view of the present administration in this connection. 

TIME IOR CARRYING OFT THE SCHEME, This emigration sheald be arranged to be carried ont so late in the year as to secure IU members from risk of the pernicious fever which infests the point which should be the immediate objective. I:. deed, I would suggest a day as lata us the 2lh of ; December, the day Puerto began bis campaign j against ice lat fear. It u, h job know, jrtt fete day in Cuba one of extreme relaxation with officers, so'diers, HDd the people of the cities and all become absorbed with tne amusements or tne bonr, so that there Is no discipline or organisation among the people for the time. A landing made then consequently will find affairs peculiarly favor able for Us success. THE GAINS of the capture of Santiago de Cuba would, of course, be enormous, moral anu material. 1. it would give Cuba a seaport, In which connec tion I will hereafter submit a special plan of subse quent defense. . a great quantity oi money, sugar, conee, ram, cocoa, and some tobacco would be acquired to be devoted to the Immediate nses or the republic ac quired bv the confiscation of all In the hands or the bpanlsh Government and Spanish enemies, and also by donations on the part of friends. 8. Many arms and much military supplies would be captured, enough to arm and equip a native force that would Immediately assembled most eager for arms. 4. If conducted with proper secrecy and sndacity. or dash, I am confident that some Spanish officers of high rank would be taken and ma le hostages for the future treatment of prisoners ot war with pro per humanity on the Spanish side; and soon, In deed, we might te able 1 1 force tne enemy to enter into a cartel for the exchange of prisoners. These are some or tue immediate results to be anticipated, while the moral phases of the affair are upon the surface. A GAS EXPLOSION. Ititnnmen Hevercly Injured Probable Fatal Jujurles io i ne ureal rnysiciaa Lii-ro-Tai. About 1 o'clock last evening, says the 8an Francisco Jlulletin of the 2'Jth tilt., a terrific explosion occurred in the building on the south east corner of Clay and Dupont streets. The building was owned by the great Chinese physi cian who, during the past six years, has hum bugged thousands of Americans, and amassed a magnificent fortune, and was occupied solely by Chinese. now TnE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. At the hour above named, Dr. Li-Po-Tal, accompanied by two other Chinamen, entered the house, and going upstairs, proceeded to one of the front rooms, which was fitted up in a style of gorgeous Chinese elegance. They opened the door of the room, entered, and the Doctor, taking a match, lit it iorine purpose or lighting the gas, and there immediately followed an explosion, which was most disastrous In its effects. It appears that tne person wno bad cleaned up the room in the morning had turned on the gas, and it had been escaping all day, and as the room was almost air-tigut, it bad become completely filled with gas, which, commingling with the atmospheric air, had formed a com pound fully as explosive as gunpowder, and almost as terrific in its effects as nitro-glycerine. WHAT FOLLOWED. The lighting of the match Fet fire to the ex plosive compound, and a loud report followed; every window In the room was shattered to pieces; the furniture was demolished, and almost everything in the room was rendered a total wreck. Dr. Ll-Po- lal, who bad advanced farthest into the room, was thrown with great violence to the floor, and his head. face. arms. and neck burned In a most terrible manner, lie also inhaled a volume of flame, and the air pas sages leading to the lungs were badly burned. The Chiuiiman who was immediately behind him was also severely burned about the head, face, and shoulders, lie, too, was thrown to the floor. The third man stood near the door, and was considerably burned, but not near so badly as either of his companions. Scelug the explosion, he jumped back and attempted to get down the stairs, but tripping, fell headlong to the bottom and sustained severe injuries or the head so severe, in fact, that he was unable to get up. EXCITEMENT AMONG THE CHINESE. lbe report of tne explosion was beard by a large number of persons, who hastened to the spot, and in a few minutes several hundred per sons had collected. An American physician was summoned to attend upon the injured Chinamen, and he did all he could to alleviate their sufferings, but he informed an attache of the liuluiin that the injuries of Ll-l'o-1 al were of such a character that it was almost impossi ble lor him to survive. . ANOTHER MEXICAN GRANT. Five Leagues of Tin Alines Claimed. The following communication appears in the Cincinnati vommerciai: 'While the newspapers are discussing the questions of the Mctiarrahan claim, and the probable reasons lor urant taking so mucu in terest tnerein, it may not ue improper to call the attention of the public to another fraud that that is nearly it not ot quite equal magnitude to the great Jklctiarraban swindle. I refer to the attempt to float a Mexican grant on the Temeschal tin miners in San Bernardino county, California. "A succinct history of this case may not be uninteresting to your many readers. About 1S53 or 1854 Leonardo Serrano, a native Callforniau, put in a claim, before the Hoard ot Land Com' missioners, wmcn was in session at tnat time in California, for a Mexican grant of five leagues of land to cover what was known as the Kancho de Temeschal. After due investi gation bis claim was rejected, and so the mat ter rested until 185H, when tin was discovered, In rather a romantic way, within three miles of the Serrano house: but in the interim Ser rano bad died. Upon the discovery of tin, Mr, Abel Stearns, of Los Angeles, bought the widow Serrano's claim. Stearns, by the way, was the first man that ever sent any California gold to the I'nited States Mint, he having sent gold taken from the diggings near the .Mission can rcrnando, twenty-live miles from Los Angeles, more than ten years before Marshall discovered iroia in sutlers mill-race Stearns took an appeal in the United States District Court from the Land Commissioner's decision, and after considerable delay obtained a decree for five leagues of lands. The locators of the mining claims then appealed to the Supreme Court at Washington, where, in 18(17, the finding of the court below was reversed, and me claim and mines were declared puouc land. During the pendency of the result in Washington, Pioch A Co., of San Francisco, tried unsuccessfully to purchase some of the lodes in the tin districts from the original locators. After the decision of the cupreme Court, l'ioch bought the Ban Jacinto Kanche, a grant that was confirmed by the Land CoinmlS' sioners about sixteen years atro, and situated twenty-six miles from Temeschal. Pioch is now before the Land Commissioner at Washington, trying, with considerable show of success, to tioat this grant on tne tin mines. Here are tin mines that were discovered eleven years ago, from which ore has been taken which would yield over CO per cent, of tin the only locality In the United States where tin has been found in paying quantities; and yet they are unde veloped. The only thing that has been done with them was to make a tin box, which was presented to ex-becretary beward, and which was itemized by every paper in the United States as something very remarkable. Yes, all of these years these mines have been dormant; the discoverers of the mines have not been permitted to work them, and the grant claimants would not work them for fear of attracting public attention to their true value belore tbey bad tne title arranged to suit tuem selves. . It these mines were equally developed they would, doubtless, be as valuable as the New LJria Quicksilver Mines, bet the country is losing revenue which would be derived from the working oi the same, all because a lew men de sire, by fraud, to take that which justly belongs to tne people Cincinnati permitted Mrs. Ilessing, a re spectable woman, to be buried alive in a well pit, and deliberated two hours whether there wm nnv use in trvlng to get her nut. 8he dead when her body was recovered, bat tue city is tot fcaugta I or uHxaer.

Lomion, Dec. 7 The special correspondent of the Ttibunt at tbo headquarters of tbe t'rowu Prince of fcaxony, at Chateau de Conen, writes on the- 1st: "I'rince ueorge has removed nis head quarters from Lo Vert Galaut to Chelles-on-the-Marne, to co-operate with the expedition or the 6i h Corps. There was a grand effort yesterilay. The day before there was a heavy cauuouade, but no infantry appeared on the uortb Bide. Very early yesterday It was apparent there was hot wrk ou the west; the fort of Alout Valerien was thundering away. "From an eminence overhanging Argenteuu everything was visible. A battle was In progress at the south. Towards Mont Valerien, but closer to my position, the work was very warm, tstnee early in tbe morning, shells from batteries at Nantcrre and courbevoie had been crashing into iiezons aud Argen- tcuil. The sheltered road behind the larter town was scored in many places with deep rats made by shells. The bank of the river on the French side was lined by their Infantry, who kept up a falterinK fire into the darkness, in anticipation of an attempt to restore the bridge at Iiezons. The troops occupying tnat town, Argenteuii, ami tne interme diate posts stood to their arms, but made no effort to reply to a tire so purposeless and doiug so little nann. "The batteries on the other side of the river, from the eminence where I stood, kept up an unremitting Ore upon it. Shells ploughed its summit in all direc tions, and the buildings which crowned it were knocked about remorselessly, as day broke, it be came too dangerous a position, and, notwithstand ing us advantages as a point ot outlook, i was compelled to evacuate it, A retreat into the low ground beyond it was 'out of the frying-pan tuto the fire.' If I went east, shells from La jirtche were tumbling into Eplnay, titrat, and Doutu Mont- mapDy and Stains were having rough times at the hands or tne fort uouoie-crown-oi-tiio-North. rnrtber around, urancy and Le Bourget were at tacked by Fort de 1'Kst. "From Margency i accompanied a stair oincer through Montinagny to Ciarges and Arnouvlile. Then ror the nrst time the inevitable result a retro grade movement set in. The French, however. deserve credit for their regular manner or retreat. "Another demonstration took place in tne direc tion ot Le Ilourget, at a later hour. Dense co'umns or French troops showed themselves on the plaia in front of the Fort or Aubervilllers, and advanced steadily toward Le Bourget. But they lost heart before they cot nearer than the railway station, and never came within range. Bourget, already pounded with siicus, was again boniuarnea. au uay, in lact. the shell-tire from the forts all around the circuit was heavy and continuous, but so wild and pur poseless that it did little damage. Everptning on the northern side has been in the nature of a feint." FROM MEW MEXICO. Merlin of the I.esUlatnre. Santa Fe, N. M., Dec. 7 Both houses of the Legislature are now in session, but they merely meet and adjourn from day to day without transacting any business, until it can be deter mined whether the session is legal or not. Some of tbe lawyers and nearly all the members of the Legislature hold that the first of the biennial sessions provided for by the laws of Congress can be held now, while others hold that the first of these sessions should not be held until December 1, 1871. Inquiries have been sent to Washington in regard to the dispute. Mining Excitement. Considerable excitement has been created here by the arrival of parties from tbe Ralston and Silver City mines with immensely rich spe cimens of ore. In a rock of eighty pounds fifty ounces of silver were obtained. Another specimen yielded ten ounces of tilvef from 22 pounds of rock, and many specimens are estimated as valuing $8000 per ton. Quite a number of per sons are getting ready to start for these mines. FROM SOUTH AMERICA. The Hlege of Montevideo. Lisbon, Dec. 6.

COTITI liltCB. BTKHTlia TBLB9RAFH OTTlOll Tnurbday. ilea. 8, 1070, I The local monev market is quite active, as tipual, but there is a tendencv to stringency. which Is probably due to tne extreme caution ot tbe banks in discounting paper and tnus lorcini? most of the transactions on the street. The ueneral Impression is that the market will work closely until after the holidays, and that rates may advance a point in consequence, but we do not anticipate any serious pressure unless tne market should be manipulated by the specula tive rings. We quote call loans at S(6 per cent, and prime paper at 7(a)'j per cent. (old is dull and weaK at a rancre oi itu,fo) In Government bonds speculatien Is quiet. though the tendency of the market continues upward. The BtOCK maraei continue active, out prices are weak.
