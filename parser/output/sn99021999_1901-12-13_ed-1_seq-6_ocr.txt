T1IAS VCnUClTY KEEDKD. While there Is very general concur rence In the proposition that the great Industrial corporations should be re quired to make public statements of their financial condition, which Presi dent Hoosovelt suggested "Is the only sure remedy which wo can now In voke," something more Is needed for their regulation and control In tho pub lie Interest. As to this tho president said: "What further remedies nru needed In the way of governmentiil regu lation or taxation can only be deter mined after publicity has been ob tained by process of law and In tho .course of administration. The first requisite Is knowledge, full and com pleteknowledge which may bo made public to the world." This, says the Springfield Republican, Is good as far as It goes, but that paper argues that publicity Is not sufllclent, referring to recent trust records of public knowledge In support of that view. It notes that there Is a large de gree of publicity touching the essential features of tho operations of the Standard Oil company, yet publicity Is absolutely without restraining effect. "Tho prlco of oil is arbitrarily advanced and the trust forthwith advances divi dend payments from 30 and 33 per cent on n watered capital to -18 per cent. Publicity hero la nnd would be met by tho trust's thumbing Its Angers to tho public." It Is n matter of pub lic knowledge, also, tho Republican goes on to say, that tho United Suites Steel trust 1b collecting profits from tho public on common stock represent lng no vnlue whatever except the value pertaining to monopoly power nnd on preferred stock which to a largo extent also represents no valuo or investment. The Sugar trust Is likewise squeezing from the public dividends on u grossly Inflated capitalization. These and tho other combinations, decluros tho He publican, go right on In perfect con tempt of public knowledge and feeling In the matter. While approving the publicity propo sition, that paper urges that publicity alono cannot adequately protect tho public from trust extortion. The trust must be forced to stand on Its own mer its as against actual and potential competition. "If this end Is to bo reached, not only must the discriminat ing railroad rate go, but tho factors' ngt cement must go. Tho practice of de pressing prices lu one locality to freeze out competition, while keeping them up lu other localities, must bo stopped. The various other devices arbitrarily to crush out competition must be stopped." Homo of these requirements are probably not within the power of congress, but such as are not may' be enforced by state legislation. At all events tho view that something moro than publicity Is needed to adequately protect the public from trust extortion Is unquestionably koumI and congres sional consideration of the problem will not bo entirely satisfactory If It shall, go no further than tho proposition for publicity, for Important as that remedy Is It would not nccomplls.h all ibat is to bo desired and we do not think It is tho only sure remedy which can now bo invoked. 

OAUK VLAXXOT IN FAVOIl. Although Secretary Oago continues to urge his plan for an asset currency It appears to find little support In congress. It Is stated that there is no disposition on the part of the finance committee of tho senate to framo any financial legis lation and those who control the com mittee are strongly opposed on principle to all of Secretary dago's recommenda tions. They don't believe In doing busi ness on bank assets, says a Washington dispatch, and they do not hesitate to say so. It is safe to sa.v that a ma jority of the house committee on bank ing nnd currency will not favor the Uogo plan, though some of the members i i .I... . . . . mm! in uiu past advocated such a change In our currency system, ono of these being the chairman of the com miitee, Mr. Fowler of New Jersev. Hut even should the house committee do the Improbable thing of reporting a meas uro tor an asset currency it can be confidently predicted that It would be overwhelmingly defeated. It Is not pos slide to get through tins congress a prop osition that involves the Impounding of most of the legal tender notes. xiioro is no public demand for the legislation which Mr. flage urges, it Is not asked for by the business Interests of the country, which are finding no dllllculty from existing currency condi tions and am qulto willing to lot well enough alone, while the general popular sentiment Is as strong today as It has ever been against tho retirement of greenbacks and replacing them with mi- tional bank currency. There Is no doubt that Secretary (Sago most earnestly be llcves that this Is tho right policy, but at present the country is not with him. 

PAKAMA COMl'ASY TAVTlLS. Senator Morgan, lu presenting to tho senate yesterday the favorable report of the senate Isthmian canals committee on the Nicaragua canul bill, made a statement that must prove very daniag lug to the Panama Canal company. lie stated that the representative of tho company In this country had written a letter to Secretary Hay alter the pros! dent of the canal commission had closed his correspondence with the Panama representative, in which an attack was made on Admiral Walker "replete with false assumptions and perversions of fact and evidently Intended to create a side Issue, the debate upon which, It Is hoped by M. llutln, will delay, If It does not defeat, the final action of congress lu providing for tho construction of any caual." The Alabrtma senator characterized this proceeding as "hut a continuation of the presumptuous and offensive prop osltlon previously made by the Panama Canal company" nnd mndo another statement regarding tho operations of the company of a rather serious nature, undoubtedly Scnntor Morgan hits full authority for what he said and such be lng tho case neither congress nor the country will be disposed to glvo any fur titer consideration to the Panntua com pauy. The fact Is that tho whole course of the Trench owners of tho Panama has been of a nature to crcnte prejudice against them. It has not been direct and straightforward. Tho company has spent many millions of dollars on the canal, which will be entirely lost If tho Nicaragua canal Is constructed, nnd the straits In which the cpmpany Is placed seem to have made the managers nnd agents almost despernte In their efforts to unload the property. The exposure of their tactics made by Senator Mor gan will doubtless prove a finishing stroke to whatever hope the company tuny have hnrt of dealing with this gov ernment. hkhuaska at sr. Louts. Governor Snvago has appointed a board of commissioners to represent Ne braska at the St. Louis exposition. These commissioners arc expected to raise a sufllelent fund to defray the ex penses of procuring suitable exhibits of Nebraska's agricultural and horticul tural resources and Industrial products and to pay tho expenses Incidental to tho procuring and caring for such an exhibit, with tho understanding that the subscriptions to the fund raised by the commission nro to bo refunded by an appropriation to bo made by the legis lature of 1003. Whllo tho governor haH no other au thority for tho nppolntment of tho St Louis exposition commission than the Invitation extended by Its board of man agers, nobody will find fault with the action ho has taken except so fur as It Indirectly commit the stnte to the re payment without limit of tho money that may be advanced. It Is true that the governor in this In stance Is simply following out the pre cedent established In securing funds for Nebraska's participation In the Now Or leans Cotton States exposition, yet we doubt very much whether the taxpayers of Nebraska desire to repeat that ex periment. The policy of pledging tho credit of the state to the promotion of projects of any kind, excepting In an extraordinary emergency, such ns tho grasshopper devastation of 1S74 or the drouth of 181M, Is of questionable pro priety. It Is certainly contrary to the Intent nnd spirit of the state constitu tion which contemplates the Imposition of taxes only for specific purposes after an appropriation has been made by tho legislature and not before such an ap propriation has received the sanction of the legislature and governor. This was the view taken by the leg islature of tho state of Washington only three years ago regarding the moneys advauced by citizens of that state to de fray the expenses of the exhibit at tho TransmlsslsslppI Exposition. In that In stance tho legislature positively declined to vote the money advanced by public- spirited citizens beeausu the expendi ture had not been previously authorized by an appropriation. The state of Nebraska should by all means -be creditably represented at the Louisiana Purchase exposition, but the requisite funds for this exhibit should either be llrst voted by the legis lature or else, raised, by outright dona tions from citizens ' and corporations who are disposed to. contribute either for the promotion of their own Interests or the general welfare of the state. The last legislature made u $10,000 appropriation for the Nebraska exhibit at the Hutfnlo exposition, but only a fraction of that fund was expended on an Insignificant state exhibit, whllo the bulk of it was absorbed by members, relatives and personal favorites of the commission. Hy far the best advertise ment at the Buffalo exposition from this state was that made by the Burlington road. It goes without saying that the Hur- llngton, Union Pacific. Missouri Pacific, Klkhorn and other Nebraska roads will make collective exhibits at St. Louis in which Nebraska's products will be con spicuous, if tho roads can be Induced to merge all their exhibits under the su pervision of the state commission ap pointed by the governor, Nebraska will be well advertised. That the next legislature is likely to refund the money that may be raised by tho commission or contributed by these corporations, without undue pres sure. Is exceedingly doubtful. The con dition of thu statu finances does not warrant such anticipations, as it seems probable that the membera of the com ing legislature will be elected on the Is.stiu of tax reduction. One Interesting feature of the numer ous improvements made by American railroads during tho last few years for tho purpose of shortening distances and reducing tho tax on motive power has been largely overlooked. Most of these betterments consist in reducing grades, making cut-offs, building tunnels and abolishing sharp curves. The latest pro ject Is for a tunnel to do away with the famous "horseshoe bend" lu Pennsyl vania, formerly advertised as one of tho principal attractions for travelers on that particular route. It Is no longer the prospect of a picturesque Journey that catches the passenger, but comfort able accommodations and high speed service. The passenger who wants to enjoy the scenery out of a car window has come to be a scarcity, while the man who wishes to reach his destination with tho least annoyance and In thu shortest time furnishes the bulk of pas senger earnings. "Tho great scenic route" as a railroad label will eventually have to go out of business. Kor all the Ills from which tho body politic is suffering, whether It be through a deficiency in the organic lnw of tho state, speculation lu state funds, corporate tax shirking, extravagance and wastefulness In county, city or school management, tho popocratlc organ has but one cure-all remedy, Tho state of Nebraska Is wearing a strait Jacket constitution that needs loosening In the stays, therefore vote tho popo cratlc ticket. The franchisee! corpora tions of Omaha have been undervalued by the tax assessors why didn't you vote the d.omoeratlo ticket? The school board Is squandering thousands of dol lars on fads and ologles by and with the advice of Superintendent Pearse, but no reform' In school management Is possl bio unless tho board Is made democratic. Viewed through the Metcock spectacles the only salvation for Omaha Is lu turning the state, county and city gov ernment over to the popocrnts. This Is logic as Is logic. Tho demand for Americans able to speak the Chinese language exceeds the supply, but must be met before we can expand our business In the Orient to nuy great extent. To case the market Sec retary of State Hay proposes to attach ten students as Interpreters to our le gatlon In China with a view to manu fncturlng thorn Into material serviceable for consular positions. As his plan con templates paying them $1,000 a year while learning the language there should be no dlfllculty lu securing plenty of volunteers for the purpose, providing always that congress Indorses the scheme by making tho necessary appro priation. The Chicago school board has just made a $10,000 lease for tho occupancy of two lloors In the Chicago Tribune building at an annual rental of $3'J,00. The reason the school board Is going Into tho Tribune building Is because It can get tho best accommodations for tho money that uro available lu that city. Just imagine tho howl that would go up lu Omaha If the Omaha school board should rent a floor of Tho Hee building for ono year at tho regular rate charged to other tenants. Insldo Washington information ex plains that tho principal opiosltlon an ticipated for the Isthmian canal bill Is to como from the railroads, which would prefer to have the tralUc carried as now across tho continent by the railroad route rather than upon an all water route by way of tho Isthmus that threat ens to deprive them of a very consid erable portion of long haul trafllc.

Thn Ohio Ival lesrlon has adopted a resolution of thanks to bo sent to I'resl dont Itoosovelt for what ho sold about tho survivors of tho union army In his mes Bago to congress. "No other cltlzons descrvo so well of the republic." said tho president, "as tho vet erans, tho survivors of thoso who saved tho union. They did tho ono deed which, It left undone, would havo meant that all nlso In our history went for nothing. But for their steadfast prowess In tho greatest crisis of our history, alt our annals would by meaningless, and our great experiment In popular freedom and self-government n gloomy folluro." It nuy seem strange that tho Loyal Legion should think It necessary to thank President Itoosovelt for that .utterance, for It is no moro than other republican presi dents havo said In tho past. It means something, however, for President Itooso velt to pay such a tribute to tho union veterans. Ho represents a new generation among presidents. Ho Is the first man to sit in tho Whlto Houso slnco 1SG0 who did not participate In tho civil wor on tho union sldo, or was old enough to havo done so when tho strugglo began. Thco- doro Hoosevelt was less than 4 years of age when that war camo. Ho hulongs to tho generation that has grown up slnco tho war, among whom thoro Is not always a clear understanding or appreciation of what tho union soldiers did for their coun try, and who are sometimes Inclined to forgot why that war was fought. President Roosevelt was not old cnougn to Know anything nbout tho war personally, but ho has read tho history of his country to good. advantage.

AHOLT NKW YOHIC Hlpi'lr In Mir Current of l.lfr In tlir .Mr-triMMiM. Millionaires nro slowly getting together In New York City. A community of Inter est Idea produces a touching of elbows tie llghtful to behold, but whether they dwell together In peace and harmony Is not so ap parent. Tho local crop of millionaires In habiting the famous Bullion How. commonly known ns Fifth avenue, would seem suffi cient for tho city's needs, nnd tho natives undoubtedly think so, But there nro others born and fattened beyond tho bounds of Manhattan. They havo grown too robust financially, and too conspicuous for comfort on their native heath, nnd seek to lose themsolvcs among Gotham's money kings, In recent years tho charmed clrelo of wealth gathered In Carneglo of Pittsburg nnd Sklbo castle, Clark of Montana, tho Dalys from tho samo bailiwick, tho Crock crs of San Kranclseo. Yerkcs of Chicago, the Huntlngtons of California and a score of others. Tho latest nddltlon Is tho Drexcls of Philadelphia. John it. Brexel has rented tho Fred V. Vanderbllt mansion, Fifth ave nue and Fortieth street, at a rental of $11, 000 a yenr. The houso Is superbly furnished and Is practically as Frederick Vanderbllt left It when ho went from New York to llvo la comparative retirement at Hydo Park on tho Hudson. Scnntor Clark Is a great lover of art, in tho Clark gallery ot paintings nro moro masterpieces than In tho gallery of any other man In America, with tho exception of W. K. Vanderbllt. Mr. Clark has agents constantly In most of tho European capitals looking out for bargains In pictures. The Clark mansion now being built will co-it nearly $2,000,000. It will bo ono of tho finest residences In America. It Is to havo a pri vate theater, every detail of which will bo perfect. Mr. Clark's hall of sculpturo will vie with that of tho Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Yerkes has been In Now York fivo years, but n great deal of his tlmo recently has been spent In London, where ho Is In terested In underground electric railroads. Another palatial resldcnco going up on the farther end of Fifth nvenuo Is that of Andrew Carnegie. This houco will not havo so claborato an exterior ns tho Clark house, but It Is said that Its Interior decoration will bo fully an costly as thoso ot tho sen ator's homo. Tho Carneglo art and sculpture gnllerles will represent an Investment of about $1,000,000. Though Mr. Carneglo haB so long been Identified with New York, ho comes well under tho list of outsiders; for It has only been within very recent yenrs that ho has mado Now York his p'ormnnent homo. Previous to that tlmo l'lttsburs ivhero ho amassed his vast fortune wn. ..biding place. Perhaps tho person who happen! to bo temporarily "hard up" in New York and who Is not sometimes? and who goes into a pawnshop, glides Into ono of tho stalls and "soaks" his watch for a titty, or per haps two, fancies that nobody will know anything about It. Tho person will bo wrong. There has been n great deal moro to It than that. His name and nddrcss will havo boon reported to pollco headquarters and registered there, together with tho number of his watch, and all this will bo on record In black and white, not only for tho present generation, but for posterity. Incidentally It will probably surprise tho general reader to leurn how many watches nro pawned In Now York In tho courso of a year. As a mnttor of record, reports tho New York Times, thoro nro considerably moro thnn 1,000,000 watches entered In pawn fit tho various licensed shops In that city In tho courso of o twelvemonth. Of courso theso nro not 1,000,000 different watches, for a good many of them nro realized upon and taken out several times. Tho numbor pawned, too, varies from month to month, but on nn avorago thoro nro qulto fully 100,000 different entries monthly for pawned wntchos reported to pollco head quarters and thcro filed away for futuro reference. Tho reason for tho ontry of tho watches, with their numbers and the names and nd- dresscu of tholr owners. Is thnt a means may bo provided for tho tracing and ro covory of articles that havo been either stolen from or lost hy their original owners. Tho amount ot public work in progress In Now York at tho present tlmo Is something astonishing. It Is doubtful if any city In tbo world Is Improving Itself so rapidly or in such a great varloty of wajn. Tunnels, bridges, wubways, new parks nnd driveways, reservoirs nnd publlo buildings, tho total cost of which will run Into many millions, nro In process nnd projected, and somo of tho greatest of them arn rapidly approach ing completion. Tho subway now being constructed, with branches, at a cost of nearly $40,000,000, and tho new rcast river bridge, which will cost, completed, nbout $15,000,000, arc, of courpo, old Ftorles, but thero nro many plans for tho city's boneflt, of which even most Now Yorkors ltuow comparatively nothing. Besides tho sub way from city hall to Kings brldgo threo othors will bo built nnd In operntlon within the next threo yenrs. About $13,000,000 Is to bo expended on tho two Brooklyn tunnels connecting with tho city hall terminus of tho big subway ono oxtcndlng to city hall, Brooklyn, tho other via South Ferry to tho Bong Island depot In Flatbush avenue. Plans for theso two havo been prepared, soundings are being made nnd It Is nafo to say that contracts will havo been let by tilt? first of next year. Still another tunnol Is njoro than holf built under tho North river from Morton street, Now York, to Jersey City. Brldgo projpctn rank next to tunnelH In Importance. A third Kast river suspension brldgo Is to be built from l'lku Btreet, Man hattan, to Washington titrect, Brooklyn, not far from tho postofllco, nt a cost of $10,000. 000. Contracts for Its piers havo already been let, so thnt Is assured. A fourth brldgo, that of tho cantilever type, Is to ox tend from Sixty-second street, Manhattan, to Blackwclls Island. Plana havo been pre pared and only await tho approval of the War department. Bids for thu six piers havo Just been opened. Tho estimated cost of this brldgo Is $8,000,000. Tho new Tombs prison will soon bo ready for tho superstructure. In the Bronx about $15,000,000 nro bolng expended on tho new Jeromo park reservoir; 5,000 men aro at work thero dally.

CIIHISTMAS mini:et. Minna Irving In tho Critic. When silver flutes and violins In Chrlstmns-land nro sighing A drenmy wait?, that sotH tho feet Of youths nnd muldoiiH Hying, I see among tho plain black coats And girlish rosebud facet Strango figures of tho long ago Como out and tnku their places. In stomachers nnd gny brocades That Tlmo has stained and faded. In buckled shoes nnd velvet suits With gold bclnccd and braided, They trend a stately minuet, Tho courtliest of tlnncoH, And underneath tho mlstloton Ilenow tholr old romnnces. When chimes nro rung nnd carols sung And snow tho lnndbcnno covers, Tho spirit of tho olden tlmo Around tho holly hovers, Then overy shadow to my gazo A powdered liend discloses, And nil tho nlr Is faintly swcot With lavender ami roses. VIh lifted sklrUt of pink nnd blue. 1 nny courtesy tlown tho middle, I hear, ubovo tho stops and strings, Tho spinet and tho fiddle. Thn creaking ot a conch and four Between tho pines and lnurols, And footsteps In tho frozen snow That vanish with carols, Cut Prices Before buying a Kodak got our "cut nrlces." AVe aro closing out our entire line preparatory to moving from our present location. "Any old price goes."
