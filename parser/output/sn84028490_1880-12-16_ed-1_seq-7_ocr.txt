Rested on each and all. And how, of His will and pleasure, All souls save a chosen few, Were doomed to the quenchless burning, And held In the way thereto. Yet never by faith', unreason A salutllersoul was tried, And never the harsh old lesson A tenderer heart belled. And after tbe painful service On that pleasant Sabbath day. He walked with bis Utile dautghei Through the apple bloom, of May. Hweet In the fresh green meadow. Sparrow and blackbird sung, Above blm their tlntea petal. The blossoming orchards hung. Around on the wonderful glory The minister looked and smiled ; "How good is the Lord who give, us These gilts Irom Hishand my child! "Behold In the bloom ol applet And the violets In the sward A hint ofthe old, lost beauty Of the Garden of the Lord I" Then up spake the little maiden, Treading on snow and pink; "Ob, Father! these pretty blossom. Are very wicked, I think, "Had there been no garden of Eden There never had been a fall ; And If never a tree had blossomed God would have loved us all." "Hush child," the rather answered, "By His decree man fell ; His way. are In clouds and darkness. But He doeth all thing, well. ' "And whether by His ordaining To us cometh good or 111, Joy or pain, light or shadow, We must fear and love Him .till." "Ob, I fear blm," said the daughter, "And I try to love Him, too; But I wish He was good and gentle, Kind and loving as you." The minleter groaned In spirit As the tremulous lip. of pain And wide, wet eye. opllfted Questioned hi. own In vain. Bowing his head be pondered The word, ofthe little one; Had he erred in his life long teachlatt Had be wrong to bis Master doner To what grim and dreadful Idol Had he leant hli holiest name? Did his own heart, loving and human, The God of bis worship ahamef And lot from the bloom and greenness, From the tender skies above. And the face of his little daughter He read a lesson ot love. No more as the cloudy terror Of Slnl's mount of Uw, But as Christ In the Syrian lilies The vision ol U d he saw. And as when, In the clefts of Horeb, Of old was His presence known, The dread Ineffable Glory Was Infinite Goodness alone. Thereafter his hearers noted In bis prayers a tendererstraln, And never the gospel of hatred Burned on his Hps again, And the scoffing tongue was prayerful, And the blinded eye. found sight, And hearts as flint aforetime Grew sort In his warmth acd light. MAKE ROOM FOR TRUE GOODNESS O Garfield, tf you would hereafter be set On a pedestal, crowned with laurel, Be sure to make room In your Cabinet For one man resplendeutly moral. This man has for years, with perpetual strain, Been doing the work ot a martyr; HIb voice Is lor virtue, and never fur gain, And his home la, you know, Cincinnati, Oh, Elder, make room for the Deacon, A truly good man, as you know. Then, Elder, make room for the Deacon, Whoever may have to go. The hue of bis hair can but faintly express The gold his heart la concealing, And the warmth or Its tint Is decidedly leas. Than the high moral heat of his feeling. His nose toa sin-burdened world has long lent Its rays, like the light of a beacon, And bis legs, as yon know like twin rainbow., are bent By the massive top gear of the Deacon, Remove this great man from the wicked embrace Of partners who vex and barrass him, And nothing on earth, In true goodness and grace, Could ever begin to surpass blm. His mind In the P. O. Department would shine, An emblem of nope to the nation, There tbe methods official he soon would refine, And push tbe Qaiette't circulation. Oh, Elder make room for the Deacon, A trulygood man, as you know. Then, Elder, make room for the Deacon, Whoever may have to go. New York Sun. Miscellaneous. FORTY-SIXTH CONGRESS.

THE ELECTORAL COUNT. Hr. HcLane then took the floor and preoeeded to apeak on Ihe Senate resolution, replying etpa dally to the .peech made yesterday by Hr. Kobe ton. He said that gentleman had laid down the proposition that no tdlolal power could be ex ercised bj Congrea. except by express grant. The 12th article of the eoa.tltutlon was the ex proa, pant to Congress to oount the vote, through all time. The Idea that the Vice President oould oount the votes, that he, who might have a place on the ticket ahould decide what vote, should be received and what rejected, had never been ae eepted In the history of the country. Over and over again had thlaaubjeot been debated. Un happily onoe In the hl.tory of tbe country a law had been passed under tbe operation of wh'oh a count had been made which would forever A MONUMENT OF DISGRACE AND DISHONOR to the oountry because that count bad oounted In a man who bad not received a majority of tht electoral vote.. Tbe Twelfth article gave the House power to elect a President under certain contingency. If Jnrli-dlotlon was conferred on a tribunal on certain contingency, that tribunal was certainly to Judge when that contingency occurred. The House must judge when Ihe eon tiogency on which It might electa President had occurred, and the Home eould not Judge of that contingency unless It verified every vote. The 12th article imposed upon tbe House tbe aatual neceaelty of counting and verifying report.. That wa. a power that could not be delegated. Know ing that the gentleman on tbe other tide met to ret tbe constitution at defiance, It wa. hi. hope that he would yet live to seo bis party again In tbe majority In the Home. If the gentleman 01 the other aide cbote to obstrnct bustnesa until tht day should come for the counting of the electoral vote, let them bave tbe responsibility. Let the OemocraUaw.lt that day, and when It oomea, let them take their testa and eea that the vote, opened b the Vice President were geuulne vote.. Let tbem aee ibat every elector wa. qual lfL'4 and let them take any other step they pleaa ed in tbe way of Inquiry and Investigation to know whether tbe electors who had cast tht votes were qualified electors. If perobance they would find, (aa wa. the case in 1877), elector, had voted who were not qualified let them have the
