profes false their claims to sions and how are morality It is alleged that certain parties set a trap to catch these hypo crites and show to the world how want ing in sincerity these moral shriekers are Whether or not the allegation in regard to a trap is true it is certain that many were caught and it is a noteworthy fact that most of those en trapped are men wto have been conspicuous t spicuous by their opposition to the practices of polygamists Now it does n in the least effect 1 the polygamist at the man who makes the complaint against him the attorney who prosecutes 4 him the grand jurors wLo indict him and the officer who arrests him are guilty of fornication or adultery his offense is in no sense modified by the guilt of his accusers I and prosecutors his punishment can not be made less because they have I 4f broken a law But the fact that they are moral lechers that they are guilty of sinful and degrading practices should be taken into account by the public and the courts and

the raid on Mormons os tensibly in the interest of morality and social purity is being carried on largely by vile lecherous menand it looks very much as if they had demon strated thisthe former have undoubt edly achieved their purpose They could have expected no more i THE MESSAGE The President message is one of the most exhaustive documents of the kind ever presented and were it not for a few blemishes would place Mr Cleve land among the advance ranks of American statesmen and executives He rises above partisanship and speaks broadminded deepthinking man 1 who realizes that he is at the head of the sreafc American republic There is 1 little that is narrow in the treatment of the various matters touched upon his views being those of the advanced I j thinkers of the country who are de i votedly attached to the nation and I bent on its maintenance its develop ment and its growth A large portion i of the message is devote 1 to a statement 1 of our foreign relations and to sug i i gestions as to what should be our t policy with regard to other countries I It Every American citizen who is in har mony with the patriotic idea of the nations grandeur and greatness will I feel prouder than before after reading t what the President says concerning our position and policy among the nations i titans of the world He elevates the J republic and attaches more importance 1 to American citizenship than has been i t l given to it by some of his predecessors F i It is a fact which cannot be disputed J that the American dignity end import t ance abroad is in the citizen Himself more than in any respect that is enter tained for the country by the great powers of the world So little attenticn has been paid to affairs beyond our own borders that other countries treat American citizens civilly not because they we ciizens of a republic able and a t F T respect for itslf and ready to enforce account individuals own people but on the ind count without reference to his citizen ship if Cleveland can ha e his way P the United States will be regarded by the nations of the world in a better light thanit has been for these many years It Is painful to note the Presidents transition from the plane of lofty statesmanship to the level of the vulgar politician Mr Cleveland gives two columns to the silver coinage qae veriest slave of tion treating it as the di He do the money lender would matter mail subsidy poses of the ocean must commend him in a mJnner hat as the careful executive bent only on enforced and seeing the law properly honestly expended for the public money arid dro S the best good of the people down to the level of the violentlypartisan hired press corres newspaper editor or pondent m the treatment of the Mor mon question HOT doesthis read in the most important State paper that will come from the President a doc ument that will be a part of the ex ecutive and legislative history of the country The strength the perpetuity and the of the nation rest upon our destiny homes established by the law of God Warded by parental care regulated by parental authority and sanctified by parental love These are not the homes of polygamy The mothers of our land who rule the nation as they would the characters and guide the actions of their sons live according to Gods holy ordinance and each pure and happy in the exclusive love of the father of her children sheds the warm light of true womanhood upper verted and unpolluted upon all within her pure and wholesome family circle These are not the cheerless crushed and unwomanly mothers of polygamy The fathers of our families arc the best citizens of the Republic wife and children are the sources of patriotism and conjugal and parental affection beget devotion to the country The man who undefiled with plural marriage is surrounded in his single home with his wife and children has a stake in the country which inspires with respect for its laws and courage for its defense These are not the fathers of polygamous families This would sound all right in an anti Mormon newspaper and might be looked for in a missionary tract designed for the conversion of the Saints to an abandonment of their belief and practices regarding marriage but who will say that it is appropriate language for a Presidential message Old man Hoar might be expected to talk in this way when pleading for the passage of a bill for punishing the Mormons but it is undignified and im proper in an executive message Vulgar politicians and howling demogogues I excite the people with such language but Presidents ought not to resort to this method It looks as if Mr Cleve land were stooping in order to catch popular applause No one for a moment ever hoped the President would pass the Mormon problem by in silence all expecting be would call at tention to the condition of things in Utah and that he would make sugges tions to Congress but few thought he would be otherwise than dignified and statesmanlike in his utterances That he has not been so will grieve his friends and admirers outside of Utah who are as much opposed to the Mormon system as he can possibly be We regret that Mr Clevelands first message which began so well and which is generally so able and brilliant should have been marred and dimmed by so much that is ordinary and commonplace It drops him as a man and a President and one rues from its perusal with his opinion of Mr Cleveland somewhat lowered OSE 

FRANK H BEERS was until very recently a lettercarrier in Chicago but now ho is seeking employment When ho gets another job he will pro babiy not talk himself out of it as he I did in the case of the last one While riding in a street car ho was heard to say that Hendricka ought to have been dead and in hell years ago and that if anything should happen to Cleveland he didnt see thatthe country would suffer A gentleman who over heard the remark reported it to Superintendent Donovan who with the indignant gentleman immediately went in search of the young man They found Beers delivering mail and he tried to apologize for his indecent re marks but was cut short by the super intendent who indignantly discharged him on the spot There are a good many offensive partisans of the Beers stripe in the government service to the shame of the President be it said THE 

LATE VicePresident Hendricks never took kindly to his office When placed on the ticket with Tilden it was I against his wishes and we are all familiar with the great pressure that it required to induce him to accept the nomination last year His idea of the position of VicePresident was illu strated by a remark he made to a Senator who nodded towards Wheeler the Fraud VicePresident who was pre siding over the Senate and asked Hen dricks if he felt envious Nopromptly replied Hendricla No place has any attraction for me where all the strain CAmJS on the seat of the trousers Senator Sherman who has just been elected President of the Senate evi dently entertains views different from those of the late VicePresident
