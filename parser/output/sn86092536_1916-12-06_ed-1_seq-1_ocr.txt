WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. ? President ! Wilson's address to Congress today was marked by a woman suffrage coup 3n the galleries ? the first real show of organized militancy in the capital ?and by a great demonstration of congratulations to the President upon ??^-election in which many Republicans joined with the Democrats. After acknowledging the prolonged cheers and applause which greeted his.; entry to the hall of the House, the J President launched into his address, reviewing recommendations for rail road legislation, a corrupt practices act and had passed ?o his recommen dations for a broader government for Porto Rico. He was just about to begin a sentence: "The present laws governing the island and regulating fhe rights and privileges of its people are not just," when over the rail of j 'he gallery, where sat a party of wo- ( men suffrage leaders, there fluttered down abov? the heads of an amazed ; assemblage of senators and represen- ' rativea a silken banner of suffrage yel- ; low. bearing in great black letters the inscription: 1 "President Wilson, what will you do for woman suffrage?" j The suffragists said afterward It was t heir protest against the President's j plea with Congress for broader suff-! rage for the men of Porto Rico, while, he did not mention their own cause in his address. i Wilson Undisturbed. As rhe banner rippled down, the suf- ? fragisrs sa: smiling and unperturbed.; watching rhe effect. A diminutive} page, raised on the a^ms of men di-j rectly under the gallery, grasped the ' edge of flu- banner and snatched it: down. President Wilson, attracted by the stir. looked up from his reading, and. apparently taking in the situation at a glance. smiled broadly and with-' out hesitation or in trepidation, turned his eyes back to his manuscript and continued hi? address to its end with-; out further demonstrations. Policemen and gallery guards hur-! ried to where rhe women were seated, bur contented themselves with watch ing the party, as if to prevent a fur-j rher outbreak. I As it turned out. the women had j rbeir plans laid with precision and j sprung their coup almost on the sec- . ond. Evidently in possession of an ; advance copy of the President's ad- j dress, they had timed the document j at the speed they expected he would j read, and anticipated he would reach j ,the Porro Rico section in eight min- . utes. Miss Me'o-! Vernon, of Nevada, who heckled the President here a*, his Am- : eriean federation of Labor speech last ; July. ar.i] who smuggled the banner i n r ?? the Hou?e gallery under her coat' today. kept rime and gave the signal: for the unfurling of r.h>- banner. Before the police could get to thej gallery the suffragists' press agent! was busy handing out "canned" re-i ports of* the affair replete in detail,; living the names of the militants and ; interviews with each. Suffs Satisfied. The coup, say rhe suffragists, work-j ed well enough to suit them even irj it failed to draw any acknowledgment,! ami they plan something more start- j ling the next time. Everybody around ! the Congressional Union who had any- ; :htng to '}o with it was keen for an-j other. "It was a most excellent >!e;nofistra- I run" said Chairman Alice Pan!, smil- i 5 n?r happily, "certainly wo may in trse ! future adopt" various methods ni>t disun-i ilflr to the or.?- we used today r.. keep] Congress reminded of our cause."

WASHINGTON. Doc. r?. ? Curtail ment. of coaling privileges at British ports Is threatening farreaching ef fects on American shipping, and while representations have been made io Great Britain by the state department, it is realized here that it may be (lit ticult to secure any alleviation of the constantly tightening restrictions im posed by the British authorities, of ficials point out that the right to coal at foreign ports is based almost en tirely on international comity and that treaty pledges in the present instance are not of :t nature to make the case entirely clear. Great Britain's inability to guar antee bunker coal to an> vessel not utilizing it "in such a way thai Brit ish or allied interests are benefited." was announced today in a statement by the British embassy in the form of a memorandum drawn up in London. The announcement is l he first public expression, officials say, ot a policy which has in fact been in operation for some time and which has brought forth protests by this country in sev eral cases. Many American <hips have been refused coal, i' is declared, and consequently held up for from three days to a week, with a resulting heavv loss to their owners.
