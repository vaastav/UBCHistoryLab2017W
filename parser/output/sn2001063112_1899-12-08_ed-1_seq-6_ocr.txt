*. \yr "iA'' -V* THE MITCHELL CAPITAL FRIDAY, DECEMBERS, 1899. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. While tlu president's message may be longer than such documents usually arc, yet President McKinley has had more to deal with than is usually the ease. The message has been looked forward to with unusual interest and its words are not in the least dis appointing in what it was expected the chief magistrate would say npon certain topics. There is a firmness and strength in his words that gives con fidence to the people the executive with a confidence of his being able to carry out the things which he be lieves to be the best for this nation. Probably the most, interisting port ion of the message and one that will be read with greater interest is that concerning the Philippines. He care fully points out the successive steps that has placed the absolute sovereignty of the islands in the hands of this government. lie relates the earnest efforts that were put forth by the administration and the naval and military representatives of this nation to avoid anything of a conilict with the natives. The president does not offer his own knowledge of the situation as to withdrawing from the islands hut submits the evidence furnished by the non-partisan commission which visited the islands to make the investigation 011 this point. Concerning the future government of the Philippines the president does not assume to look into the future to advise the kind of a government that will be satisfactory to the people of the island, but wisely leaves it to congress and the develop ment of the future, and points out the impracticability of giving the natives independence under a protectorate. The other acquisitions of territory were thoroughly discussed. Concerning the matter of financial legislation the president is not mis understood when he says it "is the most fitting time to make adequate provis ion to insure the continuance of the gold standard and of the public con fidence in the ability the purposes of the government to meet all its obli gations in the money which the civi lized world recognizes as the best." and urges the adoption of the gold basis. The president does not mince his words when it conies to the matter of trusts. He declares that trusts are organized "Lo crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize the pro duction or sale of ail article of com merce and general necessity." and which are "dangerous conspiracies against the public good that should be mad'' the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation." The presi dent- expresses the hope that a more uniform system of state legislation may be enacted so as to compete with the trusts and that "means may be found by congress, within the limits of its constitutional power, so to supplement an effective code of state legislation as to make a complete system of laws throughout the United States adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rules to which reference is made." Many other important topics are en larged upon that are worthy cUreful reading and consideration by the peo ple. The message as a whole gives a faithful account of the president's stewardship in every department of the government- and of the progress of the industries of the countrv. When Senator I'ettigrew made the statement that he was ashamed of his country of course it was published in a good many papers and it finally reached the eyes of Hob Burdette. After Bob had made a long comment on the senator's remarks he wound up by making this pat illustration 011 the South Dakota senator: "I once saw a Kentucky mare, beautiful as a dream, victor in a hundred races, suckling a mule colt. And I have 110 doubt some times that mule went hee-hawing around the pasture, bawling that he was ashamed of his mother.'' Now that the football season is over with the. students all over the country ran settle down to their studies until alie spring athletics begin. Football has a higher standing among the col leges now that it ever had before, as many of the unpleasant features have been eliminated, and further because She game is played principally by the college teams. As the game is now played it will always be popular and will remain in a favorite with the public. Congress convened Monday noon and after it had been called to order Gen. Henderson, of Iowa, was elected speak er. The opening was attended by no scene of excitement other than Roberts' episode when he came forward to take the oath of congressman. Charges were preferred against him as a poly gamist and bigamist questioning his eligibility to a seat in that body. Mr. Roberts was asked to defer being sworn in until the charges were in vestigated. A committee of nine was asked to be appointed to whom should be referred the question as to whether he should be sworn in, and for the 1 house to decide upon such question and right. In the senate charges were also preferred against Senator Quay from Pennsylvania and Senator Clark from Montana against their taking their seats. The two senators were sworn in, however, but the investigat ion will be taken up some time later. The senate adjourned at noon in honor of the memory of Vice President Ilobart. It is going to take some money to run the country until .Tune 30, 190], according to the estimates of the secre tary of the treasury. The aggregate appropriations for the two years amount to $1,li.'H.0*1.994. Billy Mason and Hilly Atkinson have been insulted and slighted by their chief. A few days ago Aguinaldo is sued a proclamation and made a special mention of his friend, W. .T. Bryan, without ever taking into consideration the other two gentlemen. It is an affront the friends of these two "aunt ies" should not overlook. They have been too zealous in the cause to not be recognized by the Filipino adminis tration. The reform press association held a meeting at Huron a few days ago and one of the things they did was to en dorse the candidacy of Railroad Com missioner LaFolletle for the nomi nation of governor and to agree to give Tommy Avers anything that he might ask for. This is what the reform editors want to do. The populists may object to their way of doing. La Follette would be an easy mark for governor. Hon. James McDowell, who was register of the Huron land office during the Harrison administration, died in Washington Saturday and was buried at Bloomington, 111., on Monday. The deceased gentleman has many friends in this state who will regret to hear of his death. He came to this state long before it was admitted and lived among us until he removed to Washington to accept a position under the govern ment. Maris Taylor, who has been Govern or Lee's public examiner ever since he was elected governor, has tendered his resignation and accepted the receiver ship of a building and loan association in Aberdeen. Mr. Taylor evidently hasn't much faith in the fusion party winning in the next campaign and lets go of a job that hasn't a very long life to it for one that will last a number of years. A number of changes have been rung in on Andy since he became governor of South Dakota.
