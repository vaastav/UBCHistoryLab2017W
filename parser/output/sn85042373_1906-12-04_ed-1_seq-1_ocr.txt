Shortly before that time the defend ant and his attorneys, Judge W. S.Lau der, Seth W. Richardson and J. F. Cal lahan. wore notified by Judge Pollock that the jury had arrived at a verdict and was ready to report Court was convened and the Jury was called into the court room after having been out since 9:15 p. m. Saturday. Judge Pollock requested that the foreman of the jury announce the ver dict, wtytofc was. the jury. Had the defendant guilty as charged." Major Murphy maintained bis usual calm •dHWMWr^md bqre no well un der the shock. Mrs.' Murphy, than whom there is no truer or nobler wom an in the state, was present to abstain her husband in the crisis of their lives and show her unfaltering loyalty. Judge Lander asked for a stay of sentence, which was granted by the court, the stajc being granted to the first day of the January tferm. Counsel also made an oral motion for a new trial. The verdict was a surprise to the majority of people who had kept in cilose touch with the case, the greater number looking forward for a dis agreement and several predicting an acquittal. The jury reported yester day morning about 10 o'clock that an agreement was impossible and asked for instructions. Judge Pollock com plied. with the request and sent them back to the jury room, urging them to come to an agreement It is said that the jury at that time stood nine for conviction to three for acquittal. Later In the day it was rumored that the vote was seven for conviction and five for acquittal. The charge upon which the defend ant was arrested and convicted was forgery in the third degree, the specific charge being that he uttered a forged road tax receipt of the Great Northern Railroad company of the township of Ross, Ward county. He was arrested July 17, IffQS, on two charges, similar in nature,'one of the complaining wit nesses being Harry Hardy and the other Wpi. Crowder. The latter was the complaining witness In the charge upon which the defendant was con victed. He gave bond and mm IIM KdEEMEHT One of the Hardest Fought Legal Battles In State's History—Case Will be Appealed to Highest Court hi the Land—Stay of Execution aBked for a change of venue, which was grant ed by Judge Ctoss of the Eighth judi cial district, Cass county being as signed as the place of trial and Judge Pollock named as judge. The first trial was set for Jan. 5, 1906, and continued three and one half weeks, the jury falling to arrive at a verdict. It is said the jury stood six for acquittal' and six for conviction at that time. The attorneys for the state .in the first hearing was Asst U. g. Attorney B. D. Townsend, States At torney Geo. A. McGee of Ward county and Assistant State's Attorney J. E. Greene of Ward county. Jndge W. S. Lauder of Wahpeton and Messrs. Bar nett and Richardson of Fargo were at torneys for the defense in the first bearing. The Ward county commissioners de cided that a second trial was unnec essary, owing to the expense Involved, and the defendant did not desire a second trial for the same reason, but Judge Pollock decided that the defen dant was entitled to a verdict of ac quittal or conviction and ordered a second trial,, which began Nov. 8. the hearing ending Dec. 1, when the case was submitted to the jury. The jury was out almost two full days. Major Murphy has been prominent in Ward county politics for nearly fif teen years and was leader of the re publican organisation of that county for some ten years. He was a member of the legislature and for several terms nerved as chairman of the Ward coun ty republican central committee. For some four years he was agent of the Great Northern and Soo Railway com panies for the handling of railroad road taxes, and It was while acting in ISt this latter capacity that he is alleged to have committed the acts which led to his arrest, trials and conviction. Owing to his pleasing personality, his heartiness and frankness of manner, he enjoys a wide acquaintance over the state and has many warm friends, who have entire confidence in his integrity. Biicnhw Trial. The second Murphy trial wili cost Ward county more than the first hear ing. Clerk of Court Sargent has not completed the figures for expenses of witnesses and jurors, but it Is esti mated that Cass county warrants have been drawn to the amount of nearly fiiiOO for state witnesses to the num ber of about forty. The jury in the case will cost something over 91,000 and the attorneys' fees over fltSOO. The cost of witnesses does not Include the expense of deputy sheriffs in hunt ing them up, mileage of sheriffs, etc. The exact bill which will be presented to Ward county on behalf of Cass county will be fully as large as the bill for the first trial and perhaps larger. It should be remembered that all of the jurors have been held here during most of the trial'. Twenty-Three Day*. There was some comment on the streets last night over the peculiar fact that the Jury In the Murphy case worked twenty-three days. Of course there is no significance in the coinci dence with the slang hoodoo expres sion of recent invention. CAN If AVE 

STATE. Cases of Idaho Men Charged With Harder of Former Goveraor Decided! Washington, Dec. 4.—The supreme court has decided the habeas corpus Cases of Moyer, Haywood and Petti bone, representatives of the western federation of miners, now beld In. an |daho prison. The supreme court de cided that the men must stay In Idaho tor trial. They are charged with com plicity In the murder of former Gover nor Sten'nenberg. President Roosevelt in his annual message again urges the enactmeut of law prohibiting corporations from contributing to campaign fuuds. lit* also urges the passage of the measure conferring upon the government the right of appeal In criminal cases on questions of law. Continuing, t!:e president says: I cannot too strongly urge the p:is sage of the bill In question. A failure to pass It will result In seriously ham pering the government in Its effort t: obtain Justice, especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations who do wrong, and may also prevent the government from obtaining Justice for wageworkers who are not them selves sble effectively to contest a case where -the judgment of an inferior court has been against them. 1 have specifically In riew a recent decision by a district Judge leaving railway employees without remedy for viola tion of a certain so called labor statute. The Importance of enacting into law the particular bill In question Is fur ther Increased by the fact that the gov ernment has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law la those trust and Interstate commerce cases where such a course offers a rea sonable chance of success. Proper Use of Injnnetions. In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law In connection with the issuance of Injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that tbe right of ap plying Injunctions In labor cases should be wholly abolished. It Is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether tbe use of Injunctions In such cases would stand the test of tbe courts. In which case, of course, tbe legislation would be Ineffective. More over, I believe it would be wrong alto gether to prohibit tbe use of injunc tions. It Is criminal to permit sym pathy for criminals to weaken our bands in upholding the law. and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no Im pairment of the power of the courts to deal with them in the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of tbe power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. Asnlnat Lynching. I call your attention and tbe atten tion of the nation .ta. the urgyaiegce qf Associated Press to The Evening 'I'lmes Boston, Mass., Dec. 4.—The United States grand jury here today took up the consideration of one of the most unusual cases of alleged fraud that has ever worried the pension officials at Washington. The case Is that of John Martin of Marloboro, a gray haired veteran of the civil war. Ac­ J. G. Rawlings, a Baptist Preacher, and Alf Moore, a Negro, Were Hanged. 

BOTH WERE COHVIGIEO OF CRMIE OFKBROEfl Marks End of Long Fend Between Two Georgia Clergymen In Which the Families of Both Are Nearly Extinct—Story of the Incidents Preceding the Murders. Associated Press to The Evening Times. Valdosta, Ga., Dec. 4.—The crime for which J. G. Rawlings and Alf Moore are to be hanged today pre sented unusual features. Rawlings and W. L. Carter were neighbors twelve miles from here. Both were Baptist ministers. Several years ago a dispute arose as to the line between their respective farms. Litigation and bad blood resulted. Carter was wounded by a shot from ambush, and had Rawlings arrested on a charge of attempted murder. A few days later, on June 13, 1905, a night attack was made on the Carter home. Two of the children, Willie and Carrie Carter, were shot just outside the house, and shots were fired without effect at Carter and his wife and another daughter. The wounded boy informed his par ents that Milton and Jesse Rawlings had shot him. He died next day. After shooting the children, the at tacking party attempted to set fire to the house, but was fired upon and driven off wfyliojit further casualties. fhe coroner's jury found that the crime had been committed by Milton crime among usan3, above ai(T to tne epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up now In one part of our country, now In another. Each sec tion, north, south, east or west has Its own faults. No section can with wisdom spend Its time Jeering at the faults of another section. It should be busy trying to amend Its own short comings. To deal with the crime of conruption it is necessary to have an awakened public conscience and to sopplement this by whatever legisla tion will add speed and certainty In the execution of the law. When we deal with lynching even mors Is neces sary. A great maify white men arc lynched, but the crime Is peculiarly frequent In respect to black men. Tbe greatest existing cause of lynching Is the perpetration, especially by black men. of tbe hideous crime of rape, tbe most abominable In all the category of crimes, even worse than murder. Lawlessness grows by what It feeds upon, and when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend tbe sphere of their operations and lynch for many other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the lynchlngs are not for rape at all, while a considerable proportion of the Individuals lynched sre Innocent of all crime. There is bnt one safe rule In dealing with black men as with white men. It Is the same rule that must be ap plied In dealing with rich men and poor men—that Is, to treat each man, whatever his color, bis creed or his so cial position, with even handed Justice on his real worth as a man. White people owe it quite as much to them selves as to the colored race to treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he deserves such treatment. There Is no question of social equality or negro domination involved. In my judgment, tbe crime of rape should always be punished wltb death, as is the case with murder. Assault with Intent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least In the discretion of the court and provision should be made by which the punish ment may fallow Immediately upon the beets of the offeuse. No more shortsighted policy can be Imagined than in the fancied Interest of one class to prevent the education of another class. The white man.

Pres. Roosevelt's Message To Con dress Preachers of Mere Discontent." In dealing with both labor and cap ital, with tbe questions affecting both corporations and trades unions, there Is one matter more important to re member than aught else, and that Is the Infinite harm done by preachers of mere discontent These are tbe men who seek to excite a violent class ha tred against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper move ments for tbe better control of corpora tons snd for doing away with the abuses connected wltb wealth Into a campaign of hysterical excitement and falsehood In which tbe aim Is to In flame to madness tbe brutal pnssions of mankind. The sinister demagogues and foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign of destruction sometimes seek to as sociate themselves with those working for a genuine reform in governmental snd social methods and sometimes mas querade as such reformers. In reality they are tbe worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate, just as the purveyors of sensational slander in newspaper or magazine are tbe worst enemies of all men who are engaged in an honest effort to better what Is bad In our social and governmental condi tions. Corruption is never so rife as in com munities where tbe demagogue aud the agitator bear full sway, because In such communities all moral bands be come loosened, and hysteria and sensa tionalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. In sheer revolt against tbe squalid anarchy thus produced men are sure in tbe end to turn toward any leader who can restore order, and then their relief at being free from the in tolerable burdens of class hatred, vio lence and demagogy i* such that the.v canuot for some time be aroused to in dignation against misdeeds by men of wealth, so that they permit a new growth of tbe very abuses which were In part responsible for tbe original out break. Tbe one hope for success for our people lies in a resolute and fear less but sane and cool headed advance along the path marked out last year by this very congress. There must be a stern refusal to be misled into fol lowing either that base creature who appeals and pniulers to the lowest In­ Drew Another's Pension For Many Years ber of Co.

Associates Press to The Evening Times. New York, Dec. 4.—Terrence Mc Govern, the prize fighter who is matched to fight "Young" Corbett in Baltimore late in January, was taken to the observation ward of the King's county hospital In brooklyn today for examination as to his sanity. Accom panied by his wife and stepfather, Joseph Kenny, McGovern arrived from Washington today and went to his home in Brooklyn. According to the police, he acted in so peculiar a man ner at home that Mrs. McGovern was frightened. He then left the house and probed with a stick into ash bar rels along the curb. When the wagons came to remove the ashes, McGovern is said to have pursued the drivers with his stick, but said he was doing it playfully. A policeman stopped him and brought him to the police station where McGovern was examined by Dr. Howell of the Seney hospital, who said the flgfeter ap peared to be Insane. McGovern went to the hospital without protest stincts and pasEiousTn oriler to" arouse one set of Americans against their fel lows or that other creature, equally base, but no baser, who in a spirit of greed or to accumulate or add ta an already huge fortune seeks to exploit his fellow Americans with callous dis regard to tbelr welfare of soiil and body. Tbe man who debauches others In order to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauches others for financial profit, and when hatred is sown the crop which springs up can only be evil. The plain people who think—the me chanics, farmers, merchants, workers With head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by tbelr neighbors—owe It to them selves to remember tbat tbe most dam aging blow that can be given popular government Is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Railroad Employees' Hoars. I call your attention to tbe need of passing tbe bill limiting tbe number of hours of employment of railroad em ployees. Tbe measure is a very moder ate one, and I can conceive of no seri ous objection to It. Indeed, so far as It is In our power, it should be our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal tbe genera] in troduction of an eight hour day. There are Industries in which it is not pos sible that tbe hours of labor should be reduced. Just as there are communi ties not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good. or. If In tbe tropics, so situated that there is no analogy between their needs and ours In this matter. On tbe Isthmus of Panama, for Instance, the condi tions are in. every way so different from what they are here that an eight hour day would be absurd, just as it Is absurd, so far as the isthmus is con cerned. where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. But tbe wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely Industrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint It should be our object to do what we can in tbe direc tion of securing the general observance of an eight hour day.
