Tyli?o Isi iir has been notable chiefly with mariners on Account ol its liL'lit bouse, (Tybeo Lijrht) ono of tho most prominent on the Southern coast. It is uxod liirht, 103 fuel abovo tho nea, on tho northeast end of -Iho island, and in clear weather, it muy bo sonn nt tho dmtancn ol 1 miles. I his boaovin was extinguished by the barbarians of floor fia, shortly after they had seceded from the Union. JIany vossels aro lost on thfue banks, and the Poutbern breakers aro dangerous. Tybeo is a nioo littlo "isle of ocean," lonp:, narrow and some what marshy, in tho const county of Chatham, and in climato nnd scenery is vorymuoh liko Port Royal and tho oth er Carolina son islands. A small amount of Sea Island cotton is raisod upon it. and its inhabitants are but few. It ha a beautiful creek to tho west of if, whore a ship of any burden may lis in safety at anchor. Savanmih is fourteen miles above Tybeo Island, oa tho Savannah rivor. It has a food harbor. Vessels requir ing fourteen feet of water oome up to Ihe wharves of the city, and larger ves sels comeup to tha Five Fathom Hole, four mile below. The city is defended by Fort Wayne on tha cast side, by Fort Jackson at Five Fathom IIolo, and by Fort l'ulas ki on Cookspur Island. They have al so, sinco Secession, eroctod a small fort on Skidaway Island, covering tho creek on its wost, (sco map,) by which gun boats could cet up toward the rear of Savannah. The guns on tho parapet aro mostly fmid pieces, mounted on frameworks of wood, instead of regular carriages. Besides those, stronp; oarth works bavo lately been thrown up on the mainland along the river, and on the island in the river, to resist a naval attack, as well as earthworks on tho west and south to resist a land pttaok. Every spot of vantage ground has been seized upon and prepared for de fense. Tho cify, liko every other So cession city, considers itself impregna ble. Nevertheless, it seems tho people will decamp when they hear of Port Hoyal and such things. The cottan shipped from 5;avannah amounts to about 400,001) bales of upland annu ally. N. V. Times.

This the very latest from Pcnsacola. al a Reports of a Spy from Richmond. WASHINGTON, Dec. 1, 1861. -ry, A spy, just from Richmond, brings important information. There is a great f right there in consoquenco of the military nnd naval expeditions. Geor gia and South Carolina regiments are liscontonted, nnd aro only appeased by Jeff. Davis' prouiiso that enough troops should be sent to their homes to drivo tho Yankees into tho sea. Preparations wero making for the Rebel capital's removal, greatly to tbe rago of Virginia, which Jeff. Davis threatens to leave to its fate, on tho plea that it costs more than it comes to, supporting an army there. Important from titr South. The Richmond Examiner of Friday contains an elaborate loading articlo, insisting that the South must raiso five hundred thousand men by conscription, on tho plan of European States, if it would tight the united North with fair pros pect of success, i ho article points out tho disadvantage of all tho volunteer and militia systotns, and emphatically declares tho North unitod moro and more thouroughly by every defeat and sacrifice, and now has a regular army of five hmndred thousand. Tho Examiner publishes a telegram from Savannah, stating that Fort Pu laski had opened iiro on Tybce Island, and driven tho Federals to another point; and from Charleston, announc ing that tho Northern troops havo en tire possession of St. Helena Island, had landed at tho mouth of Ashpoor river, on tho northern sido of St. Helena Sound, nnd had attempted to land near Biiekiugham, but were driven of'.

Wheeling Intelli gencer. Tiir TIehki.s Busy at Nashville and Mkmimils. A Northern gentleman who has resided in Mississippi threo yoars, arrived hero yesterday and re ports at Memphis a fortnight ago thoro were 10,000 troops fortifying iho river above and below. In Nashvilla there was a large force of well armed and clothed troops, nearly all from tho gulf States, with tho nvowed intention to make Kentucky tho battlo field. The 30,000 additional troops called for by Gov. Harris, would be held as a reserve. No fears were expressed of slavo insur rection. Tho fooling in Eist Tennessee is ns unanimous for tho Union, ns that in tho Middle and Western is rebel. Tho report of the Secretary of tha Navy after mentioning lha capturoof Messrs. Slidell and Mason, says that the prompt action of Captain Wilkes on this occasion, merited and received the omphatio approval of this Department, and, if u too generous foibearaneo was exhibited by him in not capturing the vessel which had these Rebel Emissa ries on board, it may, in view of the special circumstances, and of his patri otic motives, be excused, but it must by no means bo permitted to oonstituto a prooedent hereafter for tha treatment of any oase of similar infraction of neu tral obligations by foreign vessels en gaged in commeroe or the carrying trado. Exfcnsivo preparations are being made by the Illinois Central Railroad Company to store corn, near Chicago, iu cribs, for which purpose a wholo see lion of laud has been appropriated. .

The West India Steamship Company have, in consoquenco of the Trout affair, ordered all their agouta to furnish no more coal to vessels of tha United States. The accounts from Bolivia are de plorable. The Commanding General at Lnpax had ordurod tho execution ot over two hundred persons who recently were engaged iu revolutionary movements. Among those who had botn executed wero ux-Piesident Cordova, Gun. Her tosa, a number of priests aud four Colonels. How they get News. Tho officers of tho blockading fleet at New Orleans rccoivo lata news by bottle express, floated down the Mississippi river, which some oT their Union triends in New Or leans and up tho Mississippi send down to them sealed. This is a very good idea, and the Union men throughout the South oould use tho same means of giving correct information of what going on without exposing themselves at all to discovery. They should try the experiment wherevor the mode o' conveying intelligence is available. All that is g. line; on at Richmond and Norfolk could bo communicated night ly in this way. Tho carrying capacity of the marine fleet, trading between Chicago aud Eastern sea ports, is not far, if any, bo low forty-five million bushels of grain, yet the receipts of produce at that port lor the present season has been so im mense that this tUet have been unable carry it off as fast as it accumulated, and at tho closo of navigation will leave at Chicago over threo million bushels of grain in store. Change f Name. In an order of Generul Sherman, dated Hilton Head, Nov. 19th, we find the following: Tho fort on Hilton Hoad will be known as "Fort Welles," and tho ono tn Bay Point, heretofore called Fort Beaure gard, will be known as "Fort Seward." How tii k Caihnet Stands Ui-on T'ib Emancipation Question. Per sons well informed say tho Cabinet stands four to threo ugainst freeing tho slaves, and puutng arms in their bunds to put down rebellion. General Cam erou and Secretaries Chase aud Welles favor it aud Sowsrd, Bates, Blair and Smith oppose it. Tbe most bitter op position is made by Smith, Bluir and Sowai'd. Tho President is understood to favor it, though be has uot come out yet liko the Cabinet members.--Wash, Cur. l'hil.i, ltiquiiir.

A nation which endures factious domestic) divisions is oxposod to disrespect abroad, and one party or both is sure, sooner or later, to .invoke foreign intervention. Nations thus tempted to intorfero nro lis not always nblo to resist the connse of Hccming cxpcj;,nP, aad ungenerous amnion, although mcssuros adopted uudur guch influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them. The disloyal citizens' of tho United States, who havo offered tho ruin of our country in reward for tho aid and coin fort which they havo invoked abroad, have received less patronage and en couragement than they probably ex pected.

Thoso nations, however, not improb ably, saw fiom the first that it was the Union which mode as well our foreign as onr domestic commerce They enn scarcoly fa.il to perceive that the effort for disunion produces tha existing difficulty, and that one strong nation promises more durable peace, ami a more extensive, valunble, and reliable commorco, than can the same nation broken into hostile frag inents. It is not my purpose to roview our discussions with foreign States, because whatever might be their wishes, or dia positions, tho integrity of our Govern ..ill . . menr mainiy ucpenas, not upon thorn but upon tho loyalty, patriotism, virtue and intelligence of the American peoplo The correspondence itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith submit tod. I venture to hopo it will appca that wo have practiced prudence and liberality toward foreign powers, avert ing causes ot irritation, nnd with firm ness maintaining our own rights and honor. OUR 

COAST DEFENCES. is at Since, however, it is apparent that hero, as in every othor State, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestio dil' lioiiliies, I recommend that adequate and omplo measures bo adopted for inuintaiiiiug thn publio defences on cv cry siae. wnno under tins genera recommendation, provision for defend ing our coast lino readily occurs to tho mi an. I also, in the same connection, ask tho attention of Congress to our great lakos nnd rivers. It is beliovcd that somo fortifications and depots of arms and munitions, with harbor and navi gation improvements, at well selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the nationul defence and preservation. I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War, express ed in his report upon the samo general subject. RAILROAD TO EAST TENNESSEE. to I deem it of importance that Ihe loyal regions of East Tennessee and Western North Carolina should be connected wiih Kentucky, and other fithful parts of the Uuion, by railroad. I therefore recommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide for the construction of sneh a road as speedily as possible. Kentncky will no doubt co-operate, and, tbrouxh her Lrgisla ture, make the most judicious selection of the 1 ine. Tbe nortberu terminus must oonnect with soae existing rail rood, aad whether the route shall be from Lexington or Nioholusville to Cumberland Gp, or from Lebanon to the Tennesseo line in the direction of Kuoxville, or some diil'uient line, oan ousily be determined. Kentucky and tho Generul Govern ment co-opcratiiiL'. and th work bo completed in a very short time, and when douo it will not only to of vast present usefulness, bat a!.,o an invalu- uble permanent imirovoiui u-n.il. its cost in all tho future. 

TREATIES WITH FOREIGN POWERS. designed ohiofly for tho interobts of commerce, and having no grave political importance, have been negotiutud, aud will bo submitted to the Senate fur their consideration. Al though we have failed to induce some of the Lt iuuu'teial puwcn to adopt a de- melioration for tho rigor of mar itime war, we have far removed nil tho obstacles from tho way oT their humane reform, oxropt such as are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence. I invite your ntten'ion to the corres pondence between Her Rritannio Maj esty, accredited to this Government, the Secretary of Slifo, relative to detention of tbe British ship Perth shire, in June last, by the United States steamer Massachusetts, for a sap posed breach of tho blockade. As Ibis detention was occasioned by an obiou misapprehension of the facts, nnd as justieo requires that we should commit ItJi'j-icnt net ct ftvindo.l : Friee right, as sanctioned by public law, I rcccommond that an appropriation be mado lo satisfy tho lcisonable demand the oivncrs ol tho Vessi 1 lor her de tention. I repeat tho recommendation of my predecessor, in bis annual message to Congress ia December last, in regard to disposition of tho surplus which probably remain after satisfying claims of American citizens against (.'hiua, pursuant to the awards of tho Commissioners under the act of the 3d March, 18.1!). If, however, it should not be deemed lvisable to carry that reccom menta tion into effect, I would suggest that au thority bo given for investing the prin cipal Jover tho surplus rcferied to in good EOcuritios, with a view to ttie sat isfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course our extensive trado with that Em pire. By tho oet ol tho oth of August last, Congress authorised tho President to in struct the commanders of suitable ves sels to defend themselves against and tooapturopirat.es. This authority has ee.i exercised in a single instance only. For tho more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce the Eastern seas, especially, it seems in a that it would also bo advisable to authorize coaimanders of sailing vessels ro-enpturo ony prize which firatcs may make of tho Unitod States vessels and their cargoes, and the Consular Courts established by law in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases, in the evt nt that this should not be objected by the legal authorities. THE 

FINANCES. The operations of the Treasury, dur ing tho period which has elapsed since your adjournment, havo beoD conducted with signal success. ihe patriotism of the neonlo h placed at the disposal of tho Govern- ment the large means demanded by the publie exigencies. Much of tho natioual loan has been taken by citizous of the industrial class es, whoso conGdonee in their country's lauu, unu zeai lor ineir country s deliv oranco from its present peril, have in duced them to contribute to the mm. port of tho Government tho whole of tli eir limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar obligations to econo my in disbursements and energy in ao tion. The reveoue from nil sources, inclu ding loans for the financial year ending on tho 30th Juno, 1SG1. was $30,835,. 000 27, und the expenditures for tho same period, inoluding payments on ac count of tho publio debt, wero 84,578, 031 34, leaving a balance in tho Treas ury on tho 1st of July of 82,257,065 80. For tho first quarter of tho financial year ending 30th September, 18G1, tha' roeeipts from oil sources, including tha balaueo rrom July 1, were SI 02,532,509 27, and tho expenses !M,2.';!),733 OD leaving a balance on tho 1st of October IStfl, of 81.292,770 IS. Estimates for lha romaining three-quarters of the year, and for the financial year of 18G3, logeuier witn nis views of the ways and means for mooting tho domauds con templated by them, will be submitted to Congress by tho Secretary of the Treas ury. It is gratifying to know the expenses made necessary by tha rebellion aro not beyond the resources of the loyal peo ple, and to believo that the same patri otism which has thns far sustained the Government will continue to sustain it till peaco and union shall again bless the land.
