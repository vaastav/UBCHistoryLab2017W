Crops have been large and prices good; new industries have been begun and old ones ox- tended; transportation and commiml cation faculties have been increased ! by additional vessels, by railway,! street railway, and road construction,! and by improvements in wireless and j telephone systems; there has been much building.

The superstition of thirteen seems to be worldwide. In Persia it is so strong that in counting it is custom ary to say, "Kleven, twelve, not thir teen," .etc. Another of Chelr superstitions relates to bread. They think It a bad omen to destroy a piece of bread, though they would not think it so to destroy anything else -that they did not need or want. Again, it is unlucky to cut bread; they always tear It Into pieces. When I have asked them why they have this feeling ln regard to bread tho answer has Invariably been, '"Bread is the gift of God." .

President Taft nearly two years ago, that is to say January 7, 1910, called the attention of Congress to the situa tion of "big business," which Colonel Roosevelt exploits In his latest mani festo, and proposed a reined for it. Col. Itoosevelt In his nrttcle says that a policy '"'constructive and not de structive" should mark the regulation of great business combinations. The record shows that President I Taft was just about two years ahead I of him In recommending such n pro gram. Until such a policy is enacted Into law, President Taft and his ad ministration are, of course, compelled to act upon the law as it stands. "The object of the anti-trust law," said President Taft in his message to Congress, "wns to suppress the abuses of business of the kind described (monopolies In clear restraint of trade).

'the subject Is ono familiar to you all. I do not come h ro today to rc-thrash tho old straw. Hut there are certain things that for the good of tho Ter ritory must continue to be said until, the public sentiment that unquestion ably exists here is crystalized into dellnlto and positive nctlon. No speakers could ask for n more appreciative audierce than Is this as sociation but, gentlemen, what Is need ed now Is no longer mere polite at tention and the fornjal approval or recommendations. It Is high time that every plantation hero represented should, in the terms of the street, "got busy" with forest work, and that at once. The sole reason why this demand can be made hero Is that suoli work will pay. Tho plantation companies are long term corporations. They should nnd can afford to look well into the future. Uy tho practise of forestry they will bencilt themselves in many particulars. j Thls whole matter is purely a busl- ness proposition. The only excuse for tho existence of forestry at all is that P is good business to use part of the land for raising trees. Thnt It IS good business so to do is proved by the experience of many nations, an cient and modern, so that indeed the degree to which forestry Is practised has become a sort of yardstick by which tho relative advancement of nations can be measured. Here in Hawaii as elsewhere, wood and water nre at the foundation of all our prosperity. Wq have given much attention of late to the right use of water, and properly so.

Incidentally ho has ac- quired a ton or two over weight ot t the adventure ho sought In a distant land and tho appellation of "skeleton," whero onco ho was addressed as plain Hobert or Hobby. Robert, who onco ' was fired with an ambition to bo a doctor, had been allowed nt the be ginning of summer vacation to visit In Napa, Cal., a cousin ho had never seen. It was somo timo after his re turn beforo his father could draw from Ills reluctant lips the story of "tho ad venture of tho skeleton." "1 found Cousin Will a dandy fel low In fvery wny, oxcopt that ho was timid," said Hobert, whoso ago Is 1 1. "I wanted to hunt wildcats and bear nnd do a lot of desperate things, but ho seemed to think thoro was adven ture enough iu sailing, fishing, hunting squirrels and birds, swimming and the like. Take Long Trips on River. "There was grent sailing thoro on tho Napa river, but it wasn't at first a bit exciting. We would go down tho river for miles and milos once clear to Mare Island, whore tho navy j.rd is nnd on two occasions wo had to camn for tho night because tho wind died down. Aunt Mary wasn't the least frightened elthor timo, be cause wo took blankots anil n supply of grub with us whonovor wo wont on long sails. The last timo we camped out wo made our couch beneath tho only tree on a place called Lono Treo farm. About dusk I noticed In tho dlstanco a thing that looked like a bush with four stalks. " 'What's that?' 1 asked Will, point ing to it. " 'An Indian's grave,' ho said. 'Lots of thorn In the Napa valley' Suggested Robbing Grave.

Hut, gentlemen, If ou do not take adequato caro of the forests that cover your watersheds it will tako a very much more complex Instrument than a current meter to record tho alternate periods of Hood and drought that In time are bound to follow th'er opening up of the protective cover. Cooperation With Government. Some plantations nre of course al ready doing much In tho way of for estry. Others might very well do more. Especially ought there to be more and better co-operation between the plantation and the government In the protection of the native forests. It may be replied that it is tho duty of the government to protect tho forests. So It Is. Hut here nt onco comes in tho question ot money, for tho government can not do work without funds any more than can the individual, and up to this timo funds in adequate measure have not been provided for forest work. A possible solution of this difficulty lies, I think, in the proposal that has recently again been brought forward, that tho money now received from water revenues from forest reserves be used by the government for forest work, instead of as at present going Into the territorial treasury as n part of the general receipts of tho land olllce. By turning this money that conies from tho forest back into tho forest, tho foundations can be laid ot a self-supporting, revenue-produc- ing forest system that in time will be one of tho most important assets of the Territory. I urgo upon tho members of this association that they use their Influence to have brought about this adjustment of revenues. Vital to Water Supply. If anyone wants to be primed wjta nn argument, tho reasons for this re quest nre these: tho continuance of the nntlvp forests on the watersheds In good condition Is essential to tho maintenance of the local water supply. Our forests when exposed to grazing and trespass quickly become un healthy and subject to destruction by insects and disease. The remedy is to maintain the forests iu their ori ginal condition or, whoro it is neces sary, to bring them back to that state. (Continued on page twelve.) Indians always burled with their dead. Finally I told Will of tho plan. Ho nearly fainted. 'What!' he gasped. 'Hob a hill In- dlnn's grave? Say, don't you know Hint some of them still live up ln Lake county? When a hill Indian hears a grave of his people has been robbed ho never rests until ho trails the ghoul and kills him." "Pshaw!' I said. "1 ain't afraid. Besides, there b no one-around to see us, and Lake county is a long way off.' Warns of Indian Ghosts. "'Hut the ghosts of Indlnns always Btay around their graves,' said Will, glancing at the creepy shadows dan cing outside the space of the camp- fire. 'I'll bet tho Bpook of that ono over thoro 1b watching us now.' "Finally I shamed Will Into agree ing to holp me. Tho wind had como up a littlo and wo planned to got tho skeleton aboard and then set sail. It was late when we advanced on tho grave with sharponod Bticks.

Will was shaking with terror by this timo nnd I was more frightened than over in my life. The dry grass around us and the weeds did a lot of unne cessary rustling, It seemed to me, and I was sure relieved when we got the skeleton In tho boat and pushed out Into the river.
