BLEASE SPEAKS IT ANDERSON IN CHAILMTKRIMTIC ADDRESS, GOVERNOR A1TACKS PRES1 DENT, SENATORS AND NEWSPAPERS. Packed Court House Hears Remarks of Executive?Tells of His Pardon Record and Says He Will <|rant More Pardons. Anderson, I\ov. 29.?Gov. Blea?e declared here this afternoon in his speech that President Wilson would not be re-elected unless he changed what, the governor Hays, is the policy of the National Democratic adminis? tration, permitting negroes to boss white men, and also girls in the gov? ernmental service in Washington. Drawing cheers from the crowds which occupied every seat and utiliz? ed every inch of room in the court house, Governor Blesse declared that the South Carolina senators and con? gressmen were afraid to denounce this eonditlon, and annour.ced that he would make a fight on it when he goes to the senate. The governor said that he was going to beat Senator E. D. Smith next summer. "He may cone around j with a pocket handkerchief to show you how to grade cotton but I am going to show you that all he has done has been to draw $7,500 a year for six years," he exclaimed, amid yells from the audience. Suying that his ambition had been satisfied when elected governor, and that he would have been content to retire if some folks hadn't meddled last summer, but he was going to make one of the United States senators sorry for his meddling. "I am going to beat him," declared Governor Blende. Governor Blease made an attack on ' the United States senators for their failure to agree on federal patron ego; said that Tlllman was standing by his friend. Thurmond, and Smith by his friend, Weston, for district at? torney, which some folks said was all right, but criticised Blease for stand ing by his friends. lie also paid his respects to J. U Sims, of Orange burg, who has been recommended for United States marshal, charging the first thing he had to do when elected was to get affidavits to show that he was not editing a negro pa? per in Radical times, and Baying that this was the brand of Democracy which Senators Tlllman and Smith said whs "Simon pure." The newspapers came In for a round of denunciation, the governor ?aytafi they eritiaiaed him f('r ?ar* doning people, and in the lame breath commended President Wilson for doing tho same. He claimed the credit of saving eight out of the thir? teen companies which the war depart? ment wanted mustered out of the Nat? ional Guard, and said no paper said he did right. ?Tour it in, Governor," yelled an enthusiast from the crowd. The governor justified his pardon? ing of Emerson and Ellison on tho ground of the large petitions filed asking clemency in their behalf, and from Solicitor Bonham endorsing the parole, and told the people if anybody didn't like what he did they could Just help themselves. This brought a laugh from the crowd. He Justified his paroling of the safocracker, Samuel K. Williams, re arrested by federal authorities, on a 1 letter received from Judge Prince, [ who sentenced the man and who ask? ed tho governor to parole him, saying he would take all the blame. He en? tered into a vigorous defense of his pardoning record and declared that ho hac! never given any except for mercy and that it made him happy to give mercy. And he expected to con? tinue pardoning people. He said that he had been criticised for pardoning a dead man, hut that the newspapers would not have to worry in this case for fear tho fellow would be sent back; to the penitentiary. The gOVarnori holding in his bauds j a catalogue of a negro college in Co? lumbia wherein both white and ne? groes are, shown in the picture of the faculty, made an attack on eduoation of negroes. He entered a declaration in favor of the taxes of white people going to the whites, and mad'? a de? nunciation of encroachment by the Federal government on the States in the course of his speech. The campaign of 1912 was recalled by tho declaration of tho governor that a man could make the canvass for governor on $300, and his charge that the friends of Jone? had raised ja fund of $250,(?00 in un effort to buy i VOten "They talk ubout Uleuse de bauching the primary; whut did they want with that $H'?0.000 but .o buy votes?'* he asked amid cheers. The governor drew a mighty cheer when he expressed his belief of car? rying Anderson by a larger majority ?for the United States senate than he bud for governor. He said that he put no stock in the stories being sent out that he had lost strength In An? derson county and the crowd veiled. : "That's right." The governor reiterated his deter" 1 initiation not to Interfere In the race foi governor( paid * tribute cd the late Representative George It. Rem-' bert, of Richland county, and thank? ed the people for the reception ac? corded him. 1 Mr. Charles Carroll Simms, of I Barnwell, who is with the governor on the present trip in the up-coun? try, made a short speech this after? noon in the court house, being well received. Mr. K. P. Smith acted as master of ceremonies. Several hun? dred people shook hands with Gover? nor* Blease after his speech. The governor and Mr. Slmms left in Sher? iff Ashley's automobile to visit Mr. J. W. Ashley at Honea Path and re? turned to Columbia tonight.

Burch, one mile south of this city, 'his afternoon was shot and killed in the lobby of the Central Hotel on East Evans street. Mr. Durch Is charged with the killing. The men had previously had an alter? cation, It Is said, earlier In the after? noon. There are conflicting state? ments as to the nature of the alter? cation which led up to the shooting. Several parties claim they witnessed the affair. At the Inquest the testi? mony was to the effect that the two men had been standing on the street talking, when Burch told Cook to come with him. The two men walk? ed from the street to the east aide of the lobby in the Central Hotel and sat down in chairs. Burch, it seems, endeavored to reconcile Cook as t? the trouble they had previously, but Cook seemed to be drinking and Burch was unable to do anything with him. Burch then got up from his seat and told Cook he would see him a little later in the afternoon and turned to walk off. Just then Cook la said to have used a curse word. Burch, it is claimed, turned to Cook, who was attempting to approach with his hand in his pocket, and Burch quickly drew his gun and be? gan firing. One of the shots took effect a little to the left In the neck, one in the left breast, piercing the heart; one be? neath the left shoulder blade. Anoth? er wound was found by the examin? ing physician, Dr. Simmons Lucas, but he did not state positively that it woe the wound of a pistol bullet. Dr. i.ucas Stated that the wourd through the heait waa sulllciviit to kill Cook j olruost Instantly. Aa soon a* Cook was shot he turned and staggered out to the s?dewalk, failing face clown ward and expired within a few mo? menta. As soon as the shooting was over Mr. Burch surrendered and was taken in charge by the sheriff. Coro? ner Gunn was sent for and a jury em? panelled and adjourned to the county court house, where the evidence was taken. The verdict was that the de? ceased came to his death by a gun? shot wound in the hands of Seeby T. Burch.
