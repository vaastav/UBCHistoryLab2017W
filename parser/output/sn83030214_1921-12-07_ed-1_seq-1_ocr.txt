"Our country ? is not only free from every impend- , \r.g menace of war, but there are ! growing assurances of the pernia- ? nsncy of peace.'' The President gave most of his attention to domestic questions, go i.g through a long series of sub? jects which he wished to bring to ?ho attention of Congress. The ses? i?n just ended was an extra session, ailed for three distinct purposes, re^bion of the taxes, revision of the | tariff ar.d the passage of a resolution \ ?ttlarjng peace with the Central | Fewer.-. The message to-day, there :\v\ ?a President Harding's first ".?'?! ??''tailed rnessSge. Views oil Labor TV.e big surprise in his message was with regard to labor.* Without going into details, he outlined a plan for the regulation of labor vhich he compared to that now ex- j ercised by the government for the j regulation of corporations, and for ' precisely the same purpose?the ? protection of the general public. }' "Just as it is not desirabie that a : corporation shall be allowed to impose f '?indue exactions upon the public," he j declared, "so it is not desirable that ( a labor organisation shall be permitted j to exact unfair terms of employment j <>r subject the public to actual dis? tresses in order to enforce its terms.'* The President left no doubt in the ? ? undo of his audience that he was j rttong for compulsory arbitration, ?long much tho same lines as the ? Kansas Industrial Court made famous : by Governor Henry J. Allen. "Boycott Out of Place" Certainly the labor leaders got this i view, and Sarouel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, ?Bsued a vigorous statement to-night riticizing *l>e President's ideas with ; regard to labor regulation, and saying , 'hat it carried the history of the labor ; movement back 400 years. "In an industrial society euch as oars the strike, the lock-out and the j ?boycott arc as much out of place and ??a disastrous in their results as ir war [or armed revolution in the domain of 'Politics," the President declared, urg- ; mg the adoption of a "thoroughgoing code of practice" and the setting up *f "judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals ?or the consideration and determina 'ion of ail disputes which menace the Public welfare." Holding that necessity demanded the ' "?Verridirig of difficulties in tariff legis-1 ?ation, the President suggested a scale j wore flexible and elastic than ordinary ?> order that "rates may be adjusted to j ?cet the unusual and changing condi BO&s which cannot be accurately antic- ; ipated." I In order to meet certain "problema , incident to unfair practices and to ex Changes, which madness in money has i,lftd? almost insolvable," the President ?commended the extension of the pow ?H? of the Tariff Commission "so that ?* can adapt itself to a scientific and 1 Ti?y Just administration of the law." the President pressed strongly, also, "t peedy action by Congress to per? mit the refunding of foreign debts to jw United States, pointing out that (Continued on next paga; ^rramOutforShewan;! *Ine on His Yacht Seized ^Yorker's British Registry ?an Went Awry in Cali- ' fornia.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6".?Among the many striking utterances ?mads by President Harding in his message to Congress to-day, the fol? lowing >nay be eited as of unusual interest and importance: "It is not my purpose to bring to you a program of world res tovation. In the main, such a program must be worked out by the nations more directly concerned. They must themselves turn to the heroic remedies l'or the menacing conditions under which they are struggling, then we can help, and we mean to help." "It will be helpful to ourselves and will improve conditions among our debtors if funding and the settlement of defaulted in? terest may he negotiated." "There is before you the completion of the enactment of what has been termed a 'permanent' tariff law, the word 'permanent' being used to distinguish it from the emergency act which the Congress expedited early in the extraordinary session and which is the law to-day. I cannot too strongly urge an early completion of this necessary legislation. ... I hope a way will be found to make for flexibility and elasticity, so that rates may be adjusted to meet unusual and changing conditions which cannot be accu? rately anticipated." "In the case of labor organizations we might well apply . . . well defined principles of regulation and supervision in order to conserve the public's interest as affected by their opera? tions. "As wc have great bodies of law carefully regulating the or? ganization and operations of industrial and financial corporations, as we have treaties and compacts among nations which look to the settlement of differences without the necessity of conflict in arms, so we might well have plans of conference of common counsel, of mediation, arbitration and judicial determination in controversies between labor and capital." "I think our tax problems, the tendency of wealth to seek non taxable investment, and the menacing increase of public debt, Federal, state and municipal, all justify a proposal to change the Constitution so as to end the issue of non-taxable bonds."

OTTAWA, Dec. 6.?Returns received to-night from to-day's general election indicated the defeat of the Meighen government and a landslide for *.he Liberals, led by W. L. Mackenzie King. Seven members of the Cabinet were de? feated. Premier Meighen was beaten in his homo constituency, Portage La Prairie, Man. His opponent was Harry Leader, Progressive. The chief plank in the Liberal plat? form is tariff reduction. The Meighen government stood for high protection. At 11 o'clock to-night Senator Rob? ertson, Minister of Labor, conceded the defeat of the government. Mr. King, Liberal leader, was elected in North York, Ont., a division nor? mally Conservative, by 1,000 majority. T. A. Crerar, leader of the Progressive party, was elected in Marquette, Man. In the eastern part of the dominion the Liberals made a clean sweep, Quebec, with sixty-five members in Parliament, will be represented entirely by Liberals. Five of the seven defeated Cabinet members were candidates in Quebec constituencies. Nova Scotia, with sixteen seats, gave, them all to Liberals, two members of the government going down to defeat in that province. Liberals were re? ported elected in three out of four Prince Edward Island divisions and in six of the eleven constituencies in New Brunswick. In Ontario, the most populous of all the provinces and long regarded as safe for the government, the Meighen party retained only thirty-eight of the sixty-two seats it held there. Sufficient information was at hand to-night to show that Mr. King, Lib? eral chieftain, would have the largest group in the next Parliament, and prob? ably a clear majority over all parties. He will thus be called upon by the Governor General to form a govern? ment. The only numbers of the Meighen Cabinet who survive the light are B. M. Baxter, Minister of Customs, elect? ed in St, John, N, P.; Sir Henry Dray ton, Minister of Finance, elected in Toronto, Ont.; S. F.

The New York Consolidated, operat? ing company of the subway and ele? vated lines of the- Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, paid a dividend on December 31, 1918, the day the Con? solidated went into a receivership, it wa3 disclosed at yesterday's session of I the Transit Commission's investigation of the traction companies. It was revealed also that the B. R. T. carried in its balance, sheet the properties of subsidiaries at cost, mak? ing no provision for possible shrink ! age in security values. According to ? Clarence J. Shenrn, special counsel of the commission, the financial methods of the B. R. T. wero not as much open ' to the criticism to which the Inter i borough has been subjected, but the I methods indicated, he declared, a "touch and go" policy that further ! accentuated the need of reform pro ! vided in the commission's reorganiza j tion plan. B. R. T. Operations Bared The disclosures regarding the B. R. i T. yesterday were brought out during; the testimony of Howard Abel, comp- j trailer of the company. Mr. Shearn | placed in evidence a report of tht B. R. T. fcr the year ended June 30, 1918, showing a surplus of $12,812,000.

The dis ; closures were brought about in the i course of the efforts of Samuel Unter | myer, chief counsel to the committee, j to get at tho cause of the alleged iri | efficiency of labor generally at the ? present time, said to bo one of the basic reasons for the high cost of con? struction. It appeared from the testimony that j certain unions, notably those of plas ! terers and others, reserved tho right to ?censor and criticize artistic cmbellish | ments ordered in structures by archi I tects, and even to demand their dc i etruction if they did not meet tho ap? proval of the workers. Banned Imitation Marble Instance after instance was cited to the committee wherein elaborate mold? ings and sculptural wonts executed by outside artisans for the decoration of interiors of hotels and private places were ordered removed or destroyed by plasterers, who, demanded the rigltfc to execute and put up the work in their own way on the job. In one instance the plasterers refused to permit the use of imitation marble in a foyer hall of a residence along Park Avenue, al? though the architect had specified it and 60 per cent of the ejection had been completed. The union men asserted that "the imitation marble didn't look good" and ordered the material removed under threat of a strike. The architect had to bow before the "artistic tastes" of the plasterers. It was developed that the unionists took this stand to make more work for their members. Among other abu?es of the labor unions recorded in yesterday's testi? mony was the alleged general practice of keeping down the membership in labor organizations and so bringing about a shortage of labor. This re? sulted in a demand for workers, it was said, and a consequent increase in wages. Under these conditions an of? ficer of the Building Trades Employers' Association said that premiums were being paid to various kinds of work? ers, carpenters, whose wages were nor? mally $9 a day, getting premiums up to $12, while plasterers, whose wages arc $10 a day, get as high as $16 in premiums. Union Stationary for Ten Years The Hoisting Engineers' Association was pointed to as one of the worst offenders in. this direction, Joseph E. Donohuc, business agent of the or? ganization, admitting that its member? ship had remained practically station? ary at about 360 members for the last ten years, and that "the idea" was to keep the membership down as the building requirements increased. Mr. Untcrmyer delved deeper into the finances of the International Brother? hood of Electrical Workers' Local No. 3, of which William A. Hogan, the financial secretary, is the guiding spirit. It was shown that other unions besides the electrical group, such as the Tile Setters' Helpers organization, also kept its membership down and re? quired non-members to obtain permit cards at $2 a week, granting them the privilege of working in the city. Four officials of the electrical work era' brotherhood refused to sign waivers of immunity ?-hen called to the witness stand, and all but one of them?Joseph Lawlcr, the treasurer ? were excused.

S. Warns Hasty Action Is III Advised 1 By Thomas Steep 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. ? Critical ! stages were reached to-day in China's j demand on Japan for the unconditional j surrender of Shantung. Three advisers to the Chinese delegation cabled their j resignations to Peking. They declared their belief that China would "get nothing" from tho conference. The Chinese delegate;;, after consulting with tho Peking government, decided i to "stick to the ship," but indicated they would end the Shantung negotia? tions precipitately if Japan insisted on retaining 50 per cent of control in thc Shantung Railway. From the Ameri? can delegation emanated a friendly warning that China's chances would be jeopardized if resignations become the order of tho day. The American dele? gation made it clear that China's in? terests were- being properly safe ! guarded. Neither Dr. Wellington Koo nor hia colleagues would sanction the com? plaints recorded by their aids who re? signed. They attributed differences of opinion to China's opening direct r.ego tiatloncs with Japan on the Shantung controversy, but explained that the negotiations are being attended by both British and American "observera," nnd therefore are in no way secret. So far, it was pointed out, China in these negotiations had gained every point she had demanded,' although the ques? tion of the control of the railway, which, the Chinese say, carries with it political control of the whole province, is yet to be decided, ! Chinese Firm on Railway ; When it comes to the railway tlic Chinese delegation, it is learned, is j prepared to disagree unless Japan back3 down entirely from nor stand for a joint control. Mansanao Hanihara, Japanese Vice-Minister for Foreign Af? fairs, to-night reiterated Japan's posi? tion that she wanted to control the railroad to prevent it from "failing to function." ' The Chinese advisers who resigned were General Huang Fu, chief mili? tary adviser; Chow Tsi-Chi, chief financial adviser and former] ? Chinese Minister of Finance, and Admiral Tsi Ting-Kan, chief naval adviser and as? sistant director of Chinese customs, 'incir resignations followed that of P. j K. C. Tyau, the Chinese delegation's general secretary, who quit yesterday after voicing his opinion that China "is getting nothing but empty promises." Specific complaints tiled by those who resigned to-day were: That China had been checkmated in pressing for each of her ten demands for administrative autonomy and ter? ritorial integrity. That the removal of foreign post office?, having been agreed upon "in principle" by all the powers, was de? ferred at the suggestion of Japan until a definite date for the removal might I be agreed upon. Action Delayed a Year That the abolition of the system of extraterritorial privileges to foreign powers had been referred to an inter? national commission which has not yet j been appointed, which will not have to j report until a year after its appoint? ment, and'whose final report may be ! accepted or rejected at the option of ) any or all the powers. That the question of the removal of I foreign troops, wireless stations, rail I way guards and other foreign control 1 had been referred to committees after ' the impression had been given out that (Continuad on pao? six) BriancTs General Policy Upheld By Both Senate and Chamber Special Cable to The Tribuno Copyright, 1921, N?w York Tribuno Inc. PARIS, Dec. 6.~-Both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies backed up Premier Briand to-day, when, under fire of a hundred interpellations re? garding his trip to the Washington arms conference, he demanded -hat discussion of that subject be post? poned until after the budget bill had been passed. The Premier insisted that it would be tactless to debate the arma? ment limitation conference while it was stiil in session, and this was con? ceded. It will be debated later. Both bodies also gave the Premier a vote of confidence on his genera! pol | icies, after he had promised an early discussion of France's part in the l Washington gathering. These votes, i asfcuring Briand's retention of office i at least until after the Christmas holi j davs. did away with the reports cir? culated in the Chamber that former President Poincar? was being groomed to succeed Briand as Premier, but these were promptly revived when the Premier and the Senator left the Sen? ate arm in arm after the session there. Briand replied briefly to one or two questions. Answering Senator Bran- ; gier's charge that the Premier was re- j sponsiblo for letting Germany bide j her capital in foreign countries, the | Premier said: "How can I oblige Stinnes when he | makes a salo in Sweden or Norway to bring the money back to Germany? When I'm held for such affairs I turn to the reparations commission. Cer? tainly the German state is impov? erished, but the country is not. If Germany does not pay it will not be failure, it will be fraudulent bank? ruptcy." The Senate's vote of confidence, 249 to 12, approved "the declaration of the Premier and his actions in Washing? ton" and expressed confidence that the government would bring about full ac? cord among the Allies and the collec? tion of credits duo from Germany. Senator de la Haye started a com? motion when he charged that Briand had humiliated the country by asking permission of the powers assembled in Washington to maintain an army. This was France's sovereign right, the Senator continued. The vote of confidence ;,n the Cham? ber stood, 400 to 100. "The Bent Writing l'aperaj ara Wh i tin* Pa?>er?."?Ad\t.
