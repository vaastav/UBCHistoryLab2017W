8 THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. (Continued from Seventh Page.) pressed has been that only such rights should apply to the Territory as should be specifiically named. DIVISION OF THE TERRITORY. It will be seen how much remains to be done for that vast and remote and yet promising portion of our country. Special authority was given to the President by the Act of Congress ap proved July 24, 1897, to divide that Territory into two land districts, and to designate the boundaries thereof, and to appoint Registers and Surveyors of said Land Otiices, and the President was also authorized to appoint a Sur veyor-General for the entire district. Pursuant to this authority, a Surveyor- General and Receiver have been ap pointed with oltices at Sitka If in the ensuing year conditions justify it, the additional land district authorized by law will be established with an office at some point in the Yukon Valley. No appropriation, however, was made for this purpose, and that is now necessary to be done for the two land districts Into which th© Territory is to be di vided. 

NEED OF A MILITARY FORCE. I concur with the Secretary of War In his suggestions as to the necessity for a military force in the Territory of Alaska for the protection of persons and property. Already a small force consisting of twenty-five men, with two officers, under command of Lieutenant- Colonel Randall of the Eighth Infant ry, has been sent to St, Michael to es tablish a military post. As it is to the interest of the Govern ment to encourage the development and settlement of the country, and its duty to follow up its citizens there with the benefits of legal machinery*, I earnestly urge upon Congreiss the establishment of a Fystem of Government of such flexibility as will enable itself to ad just itself to the future areas of the greatest population RELIEF FOR KLONDIKERS. Tho startling, though possibly exag gerated reports from the Yukon River country of the probable shortage of food lor the> large number of people who are wintering there without the means of leaving the country, are confirmed in Kuch measure as to justify bringing the matter to the attention of Congress. Access to that country this winter can be had only by the passes from Dyea juid vicinity, which is most difficult and j-erhaps an impossible task. However, should theise reports of the suffering of our lellow citizens be further verified, every effort at any cost should be made to carry them relief. INDIAN TERRITORY. Change in the System of Govern ment Needed There. For a number of years past it has been apparent that the conditions un der which the five civilized tribes were established in the Indian Territory un der treaty provisions with the United States, with the right of self-govern ment and the exclusion of all white persons from within their borders, have undergone so complete a change as to render the continuance of the system thus inaugurated practicaly impossi ble. The total number of the five civilized trih<-s, as shown by the last census, is 45*484, and this numl>er has not ma te?rially increased, while the white pop ulation is estimated at from 2tKUH)O to 250,000, which by permission of the Indian Government, has settled in the Territory. The present area of the In dian Territory contains 25,684,564 acres, much of which is very fertile land. The United States citizens residing in the Territory, most of whom have gone there hy invitation or with the con sent of the tribal authorities, have made permanent homes for themtselvc-s. Numerous towns have been built, in which from Z>tft) to .~.(MN> white people now reside. Valuable residences and business houses have been erected In many of them. business enter prbKß are carried on. in which vast t-ums of money are employed, and yet these rrople who have invested their capital in the development of the pro ductive resources of the country are cupy, end have no voice whatever in the Government of either of the nations Thousand of their children, who wore r-orn in the Territory, are of school ape, out the doors of the schools of the na tions are shut against them, and what education they {r,.t is by private con tribution. No provision for the pro lection of the life or property of these white citizens is made by the tribal The Secretary of the Interior reports that leading Indians have absorbed great tracts of land, to the exclusion Of the common p-> .pie, and Government by an Indian aristocracy has been practically established, to the detri ment of the people. It has been found impOßßlblo for the United States to Keep its citizens out of the Territory, nnd the executory conditions contained in treaties with these nations have for the most part become impossible of ex ecution, had it been possible for the Tribal Government to secure each Indi vidual Indian his full enjoyment in common with other Indians of the com mon property of the nations. Friends of the Indians have long believed that the best interests of the Indians of the five civilized tribes would be found In American citizenship, with all the rights and privileges which belong to that condition. 

"WORK OP THE INDIAN COMMIS SION. In rection 30 of the Act of March P., 1S9:1. the President was authorized to appoint three Comm-ssionens to enter Into negotiations with the Cherokee. Choctaw, Chicasaw, Muskogee (or ' Creek) and Seminole nations, common ly known as the five civilised tribes in the Indian Territory. Briefly, the purposes of the negotiations were the extinguishment of the tribal title to any lands within that territory now held by any and all of such nations or trihes, either by cession of the same or some part thereof to the United States or by allotment or by the division of same in severalty among the Indians of such nations of tribes, respectively, as may be entitled to the same, or by such other method as may be agreed upon between the several nations and tribes aforesaid, or each of them, with ; the United States, with a view to such tice and equity as may, with the con sent of the said nations of the Indians, so far as may be necessary, requisite and suitable to enable the ultimate cre said Indian Territory, The commission met with much op position from th" lv uinuinir. The In dians Were very siuu to act, and those in control manifested a decided disin clination to meet with favor the propo sitions submitted to them. After a little more than three years of this or ganization, the commission effected an agreement with the Choctaw Nation alone. The Chicasaws have refused tv agree to its terms and as they have a common interest with the Choctaw in the lands of said nations, the agree m< nt with the latter nation could not have been with the consent of the for mer. April 23, IS!>7, the commission effected an agreement with both tribes —the Choctaws and Chicasaws. This agreement, it is understood, has been ratified by the constituted authorities of the respective tribes or nations or parties thereto, and only requires rat ification by Congress to make it bind ing. On the 27th of September, ls'.»7. an agree men I was affected with the Creek Nation, but it is understood the Na tional Council refused to ratify the same. Negotiations are yet to be had with the Cherokees. the most populous of the five civilized tribes, and with the Seminoles. the smallest, in point of numbers and territory. The provisions in the Indian Appro priation Act, approved .lune- 10. 1896, makes it the duty of the commission lo investigate and determine the rights of applicants for citizenship in the rive civilised tribes. The commission is ai present engaged in this work among the tribes, and has made appointments tor taking the census of these people up to and including the .tilth of tho present month. Should the agreement between tht) Cboct&WS and Chicasaws be ratified b> Congress, and should the other tribes fail to make an agreement with them, then it will be necessary that some legislation shall be taken by Congress which, while just and honorable to the Indians, shall be invaluable to the white people who have settled upon these lands by invitation of the tribal nations. 

INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP. Hon. Henry L. Dawes, Chairman of the commission, in a letter to the Sec retary of the Interior, under date of October IS, 1886, says: "Individual ownership is, in their (the commission's) opinion, absolutely es sential to any permanent improvement in present conditions, and the lack of it is the root of nearly all the evils which have so grievously afflicted these people Allotment by agreement is tho only possible method, unless the Unit ed States courts are clothed with tho authority to apportion the lands among the citizen Indian for whose use it was originally granted." 1 concur With the Secretary of th>i Interior that there can be no cure for the evils engendered by the perversion of these great trusts, excepting by their resumption by the Government which created them. 

YELLOW FEVER. Quarantine Power Should be Aug mented to Prevent Invasion. The recent prevalence of yellow fever in a number uf cities and towns throughout the South has resulted in much disturbance of commerce and demonstrated the necessity of such amendments to our Quarantine laws as will make the regulations of the na tional quarantine authorities para- The Secretary of the Treasury, in that portion of his report relating to the operation of the Marine Hospital Ser vice, calls attt ntion to the defects in the present quarantine laws, and rec ommends amendments thereto, which will give- the Treasury Department the requisite authority to prevent the inva sion of the epidemic diseases from for eign countries, and in times of emer gency like that of the past summer will add to the efficiency of the sanitary measures for the protection of the peo ple and at the same time prevent un necessary restrictions of commerce. I concur in his recommendation. In further effort to prevent the in vasion of the United States by yellow fever, the importance of the discovery of the exact r-ause of the disease, which up to the present time has been unde termined, has been obvious, and to this end a systematic bacteriological inves tigation should be made. 1 therefore recommend that Congress authorize the appointment of a commission by the President, to consist of four expert bac teriologists, one to be selected from the medical officers of Marine Hospital Service, one to be appointed from civil life, one to be detailed from the medi cal officers of the army and one front the medical officers of the navy. 

UNION PACIFIC SALE. The Government Should Buy the Kansas Pacific if Necessary. The Union Pacific Railway main line was sold under the decree of the I'nited States Court for the district of Nebras ka on the Ist and 2d of November, this year. The amount due the Government consisted of the principal Of the subsidy bonds $27,236,512, and the accrued in terest thereon $31,211,711 To, making the total indebtedness $58,448,223 7.".. The bid at the sale covered the first mortgage Men and the entire mortgage claim by the Government, principal and interest. The sale of the subsidized portion of the Kansas Pacific line, upon which the Government holds a second mortgage lien, has been postponed at the instance of toe Government to December l«',th The debt of this division of the Union Pacific Raff road to the Government on X v ml* r 31, I>'.

The sale of this road was originally advertised for November -Ith, but for the purpose of securing the most pan ic notice the event was postponed until I >• • • mh Pith, and a second advertise ment of the sale was made. By the decree of the court the upset price of the sale of the Kansas Pacific wfil yield the Government the sum of $2,500,000 over all prior liens, costs and charges it so other or WW bid is menl will receive on its claim of nearly THE GOVERNMENT AS A I?I ODER. The Government has no information as to whether there Will be other bid ders Or a: th t hid than the maximum amount herein stated. The question presented, therefore, is, whether the Gov rnment shall under the authority given it by the Act of March 1.5, 1889, purchase or redeem tho read in the event that a bid is nut mads by prt? em wt St I 'aim. To qualify the Gov erns* nt to bid at the sale will require • deposit of $900,000, as follows: in the Government cause $500,000, and in each • I the first mortgage causes $200. --600, and in the latter the d.-posit must be in cash. Payments at the sale are as follows: Upon tic acceptance of the hid, a sum which with the amount already depos ited shall equal lo per cent, of the bid; tne balance la installments of 25 per SACKAMI-JNTU JJAJLL-X IIJIiUUiiJD-UjX-LOy. TUESDAY, 7, 1897. cent., 30, 40 and 50 days after the con firmation of the sale. The lien on the Kansas Pacific prior to that of the Government on the 80th of July, 1597, principal and interest, amounted to 57.251.04S 11. The Gov ernment, therefore, should it become the highest bidder, will have to pay the amount of the first mortgage lien. I be lieve that under the Act of ISS7 it has the authority to do this, and in the ab- S nee of any action by Congress, 1 shall direct the Secretary of the Treasury to „:ake the necessary deposit as required by the court's decree, to qualify as a bidder, and to bid at the sale a sum which will at least equal the principal of the debt due to the Government; but suggest, in order to remove all contro \. rsy, that an amendment of the law be immediately passed explicitly giving such powers and appropriating in gen eral terms whatever sum is sufficient therefor- In so important a matter as the Gov ernment becoming the probable owner of railroad property, which it perforce must conduct and operate, I feel Con strained to lay before Congress these facts for its consideration, and act be for ■ the consummation of the sale. It is clear to my mind that the Government should not permit the property to be sold at a price which will yield less than one-half the principal of its debt, and less than one-fifth of its debt, principal and interest. The Government rather than accept less than its claim should become a bidder and thereby the owner of the property and 1 submit this to Congress for action. CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY. The New Building Provided for by Congress Completed. The library building provided for by the Act of Congress approved April 17, 1896, has been completed, and open to the public. It should be a matter of congratulation that through the fore sight and munificence of Congress the nation possesses this noble treasure house of knowledge. It is earnestly to be hoped that, having done so much to ward the cause of education, Congress will continue to develop the library in every phase of research to the end that it may not be only one of the most mag nificent, but among the richest and most beautiful libraries in the world. CIVIL SERVICE. Suggestions Offered hy the Presi dent for Its Betterment. The important branch of our Govern- I ment known as the civil service, the practical improvement of which has i long been a subject of earnest discus sion, has of late years received in ! creased legislative and executive ap i provaL During the past few r months th" service has been placed on a still firmer i l as is of business methods and personal merit. While the right of our veteran soldiers j to reinstatement to deserving cases, has been asserted, dismissals for merely po- I litical reasons have been carefully ; guarded against, the examinations for > admittance to the service enlarged and ; at the same time rendered less tec hnical nnd more practical; and a distinct ad -1 vance has been made by giving a hear- I ir.g befejre dismissal upon all cases I where incompetency is charged or de ! manded, or removal of officials in any j of the departments. This order has been made to give the accused his right to be heard without lin anyway impairing the power of re moval, which should always be exer cised in cases of inefficiency and incom i potency, and which is one of the vital I safeguards of the civil service reform system, preventing stagnation and I dead-wood, and keeping every employe keenly alive to the fact that the security i of his tenure depends not on favor, but jon his own tested and carefully watched record of service. Much of course still remains to be ac j complished before the system can be I made reasonably perfect for our needs. There are places now in the classified service which ought to be exempted, ! and others unclassified may properly be I included. I shall not hesitate to ex j empt cases which I think have been im | properly included in the classified ser | vice, or include those which in my judg | nit nt will best promote the public ser vice. The system has the approval of the people and it will be my endeavor to uphold and extend it. CONCLUDING REMABKS. Appropriations Should be Kept Within Receipts. I am forced by the length of this mes sage to omit many important references to affairs of the Government with which | Congr ess will have to deal at the pres ent session. They are fully discussed in the department reports, to all of which i I invite your earnest attention. The estimates of the expenses of the Government by the several dpartments I will, I am sure, have your careful scru '■■ tiny. While Congress may find it an j easy task to reduce the expenses of the Government, it should not encourage i their increase. These expenses will, in Imy judgment, admit of a decrease in ; many branches of the Government With j cut injury to the public service. It is a ! commanding duty to keep the appro | priations within th° receipts of the Government and thus avoid a deficit. William Mckinley. Executive Mansion, December 6, 1897. STORMS IN ITALY.

CAPTAIN LOVERING. Secretary Alger Makes Public the Reprimand of Court-Martial. WASHINGTON, Dec 6. — Secretary Alger to-day made public the repri mand to Captain Lovering by sentence of the COUTt-martial, as follows: "By order of the PresMk nt. th° pro ceedings, findings and sentence in the case of Captain Leonard A. Lovering, Fourth Infantry, are approved. It is, however, disappointing that an Offense so grave and as an example so far reaching as this should have been vis ited with so light a penalty. There is no question but Private Hammond de served punishment for his conduct, but he should have received it in a lawful way. The military laws governing the army are explicit. They prescribe the duties of officers and enlisted men, with the penalties for their violation. Under them both have rights and obligations. When, therefore, an officer with the intelligence and experience with which Captain Levering is credited not only violates these laws, but exhibits such a lack of humanity as is shown in this j case, he should receive a more severe sentence than a mere reprimand. Com mitting such acts degrade the officer more than the soldier he punishes, and I shows his unfitness for the care and ment men do things which In sober mo ments tney recall with sorrow and re gret, but this case is aggravated by the fact that after weeks of deliberation the officer evinces no regret for Ins « rongful acts." ITALY'S MINISTRY. i ! Marquis Di Rudini Intrusted With Forming a New Cabinet. ROME, Dec. 6.—The Cabinet meeting this morning formally tendered its res j ignation to King Humbert.

CONDITION OF MOTHER McKINLEY WAS MUCH IMPROVED A PART OF YESTERDAY. Regained Consciousness Sufficient ly to Recognize and Greet Her Children. CANTON (Ov), Dee. 6.—There was an Mrs. Nancy Allison McKinley this af ternoon. She regained consciousness sufficiently to recognize not only her children, but to extend greeting to them, to her aged sister, Mrs. Osborn, Charles Miller and to others who were near. Nourishment was given her about noon. It was soon after this that she manifested signs of returning con sciousness. The first nourishment re ceived for several days had a telling effect, and she at once rallied. There is again stronger hope that she may recover sufficiently to survivi v - to-morrow morning, and perhaps to recognize him. It is not thought, how ever, that she will ever regain com plete consciousness. When the attending physician left Mrs, McKinley this evening it was with a feeling that she would survive the night and possibly longer. She had taken no nourishment since early in the af tei noon and was not in quite as good condition as when she seemed to recognise those about her. But she sustained li'.tk net loss of strength dur ing the day. and was reposing in a quiet and seemtngly natural condition. THE PRESIDENT STARTS FOR CANTON. WASHINGTON, Dec. o—President M.Kinley left Washington at 7:20 o'clock to-nitrht to return to the bed side of his mother at Canton. With him were Mrs. McKinley, Miss Mabel McKinley, Miss Barber, Mrs. AbW r McKinley, A. J. Duncan, two maids and j the steward of the White House. The party occupied the special Pull- , man "Newport,' - which was attached to the rear of the regular Western ex press. According to schedule, the train is due in Canton at 10 o'clock to-mor row, but upon receipt of unfavorable news from Canton it may be rushed j through on special time from any point beyond Baltimore.

The new payer money, printed in dif- ' ferent colors, will soon be in circul.i- • tion. Some of tl\e dtssgms have already : been prepared, and the others are be-1 ing executed at the Bureau of Enl ; ing. All of them will undergo criti i cism and more or less alteration before | final acceptance. President MoKink\ has express, d his approval of the Idee jis anxious to Issue the notes and < . cates as quickly as possible. l.<-ing a j easily distinguished from each other, and even the numerals on them are obscure ar.d hard to make out. This I makes counting troublesome, and a j person has to look sharp if he would I avoid giving a live-dollar note for a dollar. Secretary Gage is of the opinion that . every-day usefulness is of more im- I portance in the currency of the nation | 'han high art. Pretty pictures of re ; cumbent ladies and naked boys are j well enough In their way, but they cut no particular ice, so to speak, in Iconnection with hard and vulgar cash. I The most important point in a piece of I paper money is that it shall be easily recognizable. Its denomination must be apparent at a glance, and its kind also, whether treasury note, bank note or certificate. Of couise, safety against counterfeiting is not to be lost sight of. It is believed that all of these require ments are met by the new designs. Anybody who has a handful of these J bilis will be able ter separate them in lan instant into their dirterent rlftns t jso as to count them offhand and with out scrutiny. At the same time, the j greater simplicity of their patterns will render them actually more difficult to j i successfully. The very elab- j For illustration take the one-dollar bIU. The designs for this denomina- i j tion are already finished and are very j handsome. There are only two, one j for the face and one for the back, be cause all one-dollar bills will have the same patterns, whether certificates, bank notes or treasury notes. When you see a bill with a big spreading eagle in the middle of the face, yon will recognize it as a one-dollar bill, j without even looking at the large nu meral beneath. How, then, are you to understand what kind of a one ! dollar bill it is? The answer is, simply jby the color in which the big numeral |of dememmiation. the treasury seal and the number of the bill are printed. If, it is a treasury note these will be in I red; if a silver certificate, they will be ! in blue. There will be no other dif ferences except that each kind of bill [ will have its own legend. Hut i>eople do not want to stop and rend the legend in order to find out whether a bill is a bank note or a certificate. They do not have to do so, inasmuch as the jAt present there are three different designs for Jl bills. Fnder the new arrangement there will be only one de sign, the sole variation being in the j colors as described. It will be the same | way with the $2 bill; instead of three patterns there will be one. This scheme l will be carried out through all of the! denominations of paper money. There are nine denominations in all, running! j from $1 to $1,000. Under the present ; system there are twenty-seven patterns. ! jJust think of it—twenty-se\en sorts of : p-per currency! It is enough to confuse > i the people—especially when it is con sidered that during the last few years the designs have been undergoing rad | ical changes with every new Adminis | tration. Obviously, counterfeits are I much more likely to be detected if the j users of the currency are thoroughly fa miliar with its appearance, su as to be |stiuck by anything that is not exactly as it should be. For the new .S2 bill a head of Wash- I ington has been chosen provisionally, iOn either side of it two classical figures ,of the allegorical sort will recline. Thus something w ill be done for art incident- I ally. It would be a mistake to suppose ! that the new money is to be execul <1 !in a spirit of commercial Philistinism; |on the contrary, it will be very hand- I seme indeed. One thing very noticeable j about it is the broad blank spaces which I are left on both face and back of each j bill. Something like one-third of the en tire area of the note in each case is | blank. The back has not so much as ) one-half of the usual amount of lathe- I work engraving. The purpose of this ! modification is twofold. It will show 1 the distinctive fibre in the paper much I more plainly and the eye in examin i ing a bill will be less confused. Secretary Gage has been evolving this scheme ever since he first took charge of the Treasury. It is safe to say that 1 the present aleged "artistic" patterns of j currency would never have been adopted I under the authority of an official grad i uated from commercial life. Mr. Car ! lisle, who is responsible for the patterns jof the notes and certificates now in use, !is better acquainted with politics than ! with business. Ever since the "art | money" came into circulation bankers ; and merchants all over the country j have been complaining of it. Hank cashiers especially have found its ob | seurity a very serious inconvenience, i One notable advantage of the new plan jis that it will do away entirely with the ! industry of raising bills from small to
