Democrats and populists are not be hind tho republicans in joining in the general sympathy extended to Mr Mc Kiuloy because of the great sorrow xv-tiloh hao come upon him through the agonies of his dying mother. For the time, tho strong opposition to the recommendation's of his annual mea saX) is held in abeyance, and the criti cism to which the message is open re mains unspoken. In tha presence of the angel of death, as it were, any dis play of partisanship would be unseem "T. The opening of the session of congress was, owing to the circum stances, quieter than usual, although the crowds were there as usual. There woro numerous empty seats in both Uor.se and senate, although the attend ance was, on the whole, about up to the average of opening days. The trading stamp scheme received quito a shock yesterday by the decision of the court of appeals at Washington, when it was decided that the business was illegal and that the merchant giv ing them out as well aa the company behind the scheme were liable to arrest anI fine for enga-ging in the business. This was the third trial of the case, and those who have been looking for the outcome, are satisfied from this last de cision that the trading stamp has re ceived its death blow. It would seem that the merchants of Hartford, Nor wich, Waterbury and other cities, who have been looking for a means to fight the trading stamp companies have the weapon at hand in the form of this re cent decision. If it is illegal la one state it surely is in all, and the out come in this locality will be awaited with interest. President McKinley is now In the fourth quarter of the first year of his term as president, and the reports sent out for the first nine months are not as encouraging as we were led to believe they would be. The deficit under the Dingley tariff bill does not grow smaller, all of which leads an exchange, which has been carefully following the administration, to remark: "It is in teresting to note that the completed quarter shows no Improvement over the first or the second. The completed third Quarter, indeed, I is even more striking In Its demonstration of this ad ministration's inefficiency. Earlier in the year it might have been claimed by the partisans of the administration that the McKinley policy had not been duly tried; that the plans of the new president and his managers had not had opportunity of experiment. At the end of the second quarter, there being no chaage for the better in the manage ment of the country's affairs, it was warmly asserted by the partisans that the Dingley law, product of the admin istration, had yot to prove its efficacy as a panacea for the nation's alleged ills and the party's admitted weak nesses. The law was new, said the par tisans, and uatried. Once well under way it would sweep aside the treasury deficit and put plumes of glory Upon the republican war wagon. Now that we have reached the end of the third quar ter of the first year of the administra tion of Hannaism and Biagleyism, the adherents of the high tariff policy as exemplified in the Dingley law, have nothing to say. Newspapers that warm ly advocated the McKinley idea are close-mouthed. Public men on the re publican side who, honestly or not, put faith in the bill of Mr Dingley three months ago, are silent. The hopeful Mr Lyman J. Gage, who is sitting up nights thinking of new currency pol icies, ambles forth in a declaration that early in the next year the Dingley law will begin to turn the tide In favor of tho treasury. Mr Gage is but para phrasing the expressions of republican statesmen who predicted great things fw this bill before it became a law. Even more than they did, Gage knows that the Dingley bill will not supply the deficient revenue. The bill's prophets were guessing. Mr Gage bases his statements upon figures gathered from the custom house. Those figures tell him as truthfully as figures tell every thing that the deficit grows apace under the operations of the Dingley regula tion. Thus we have seen that the third quarter of the first year of Major Mc Kinley's first and only term as presi dent has developed absolutely nothing In the direction of good government. 

CURRENT COMMENT. It is dollars to doughnuts that Jo seph Benson Foraker won't chip in a cent to pay that $20,QOO note given by the Ohio republican state committee. According to tho latest news, the Cubans are taking the ending of the war into their own hands, by taking forts away from the Spaniards. When they no longer need help, Mr McKinley will probably promptly recognize their independence, and ask the country to tive him credit for it. CUBA. IN TOE SENATE Senator Allen of Nebraska Springs a New Besolution, WANTS CUBA RECOGNIZED He Declares Tbat tlie Commercial Spirit of the United States Is Pre venting Action Honse Holds a Fifteen-Mlnnte Session. Washington, rec. 9. Mr. Allen (Pop., Neb.), introduced in the Senate yester day a resolution declaring; it to be the sense of the Senate that Congress should, with all due convenient speed, acknowledge the independence of Cuba. He followed It with a speech, declaring- that the commercial spirit of he United States was preventing ?c ..on. He said that he had long urged rec ognition of the independence of the Cubans. He would not be content with the recognition of belligerency, but would insist upon the acknowledgment of absolute political liberty. He was satisfied that the people would not be content with the course advised by the Administration. Inasmuch as the Cu bans, for more than two years, on many battlefields, had demonstrated their valor and love for liberty, he felt that they had earned a recognition of their political liberty, and that it ought to be accorded to them Without fur ther temporizing. If necessary, this recognition should be backed by a fleet of American vessels in Cuban waters. He expressed a belief that the owners of 'Spanish bonds in this country, American citizens holding property in Cuba which had been injured or de stroyed by the insurgents, and the car rying trade of the country, which might be affected by such a step, had Joined to prevent th recognition of Cuba's independence. Mr. Allen said that"he believed that President McKinley's statement in his message that the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents is now unwise and therefore inadmis sible, would be a great disappointment to the Republicans throughout the United States. The national conven tion of that party had declared in fa vor of the independence of Cuba, go Ing farther than the simple recognition of the belligerency. He thought that the President was under obligations to carry out the pledge which his party had made a pledge which had been made to seventy-three millions of peo ple. The President, Mr. Allen thought, had been lulled to sleep by the decla ration of Spain that she would . give Cuba a semi-political existence. He expressed the belief that the Presi dent's neglect to take such action as would insure the political Independence of Cuba was an exhibition of "rank hypocrisy" and a "flagrant neglect of public duty," which would be corrected by the "all-ruling power in His own good time." Mr. Davis (Minn.), reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, a bill prohibiting the killing of fur seals in the North Pacific Ocean. He asked im mediate consideration for the bill, but Mr. Hale (Maine), objected on the ground of the importance of the meas ure and asked that the bill be printed. Senator Gear introduced a bill autho rizing the Secretary of the Treasury to enter a bid for the United States on bond-aided railroads and to clear off liens paramount to those of the United States and appropriating the amount necessary for this purpose. The bill is understood to have been framed by the Attorney General, and it is Intend ed to open the way to settlement of the Kansas Pacific debt.

Washington, Dec. 9. The Committee of the Rules of the House, of which Speaker Reed is chairman, will get to gether during the holidays to consider such change of the House rules as has shown to be desirable. It is not ex pected that these will touch any vital points, but will be rather In the nature of routine changes to facilitate the dis patch of business. The three House committees on elec tions are beginning to map out their work with a view to determining contested-election cases at the e&rllest pos sible day. There are twenty-one of these contests pending. Some of these will require extended hearings, but quite a number can be disposed of without muoh delay. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs will hold its first meeting' to day, when Chairman Hitt will name the sub-committees which will consider the several questions of Cuba, Hawaii, etc. Thus far there has been no con sultation on the general line of opera tion on the numerous foreign Bubjects before the committee.
