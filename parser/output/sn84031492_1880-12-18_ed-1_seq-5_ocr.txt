AN ENGLISH ÜBEUAL ON THE SITUATION. London, Dec. 17.— Tho Times, in Us lead ing article on the Irish question, says: Thu followers of tho Government are embar rassed, and for tho most part do not know what to say, while few are hold enough to express their regret at tho lino their loaders have pursued. Whitbread, ono of tho most respected Liberals In the House of Commons, speaking at Bedford, hist night, described vividly tho reign of terror that had loft no honest calling safe In a largo part of Ireland, and avowed his feeling that tho sad time had cpiiio when Uto Government might Do com pelled to use coercion. There have been Liberal Governments before Uto present,— Governments embarrassed by Irish difficul ties, but they have not been slack to do what they could to assert tho authority of tho law. Tho contrast between tho spirit of those times ami the spirit prevailing now Is little to tho credit of tho Government or that of tho present gene ration.'’ Ono of tho worst evils consequent upon tho Government’s attitude Is theelfect It must have on tho popular reception in Ire land of their remedial legislation. It is Im peratively necessary that (his legislation should be received ns a satisfaction of jus tice, but It Is too probable that it will bo re ceived ns a concession to lawlcsness with which tho Government did not venture to grapple. If tho arbitrary demands arc not grunted In tho form which they have been made, It will still bo said that what Is given is Uto result of tho demonstration of the Irre sistible power of ivpeople determined to Jmvo tholr own way. Most false and foolish no tions will thus bo confirmed In tho brain ol the Irish peasant. Thu shortcomings of tho Government thus threaten us with a recur rence of difficulties In tho future, for Utolr conduct will encourage a repetition of tho tactics with which they have not ventured to grapple.

FREIGHT BLOCKADE. Tho Baltimore & Ohio Hoad Makes Another Turn to Avoid tho Pennsylvania's Obstructions at Philadelphia. Tho Company Puls On a Lino of Steamships Between Baltimore ami Now York, and Announces its Readiness lo Re* celvo Freight Again. Tlint llio Pennsylvania Pond should bo cited before the Court to allow cause why the proper punishment be not visited upon It for willful violation of the decision rendered In the matter of the Junction liaad In Philadel phia can be no surprise herein Chicago as well us elsewhere throughout' the country. The course the Pennsylvania has pursued since tiie termination of legal proceedings ami the lawful use of the track by the Haiti more * Ohio Hoad has become familiar to the reading and traveling piddle. It Is well known that not a single train on the Haiti more it Ohio lias been permitted to miss over tho track In uuestlon in anything like reason able time. The lust train leaving New VorK In the evening pusses over the Junction Hoad about 10 o’clock, ami the darkness of the night Is taken advantage of, and icd lights are shown alt along the truck for the pur pose only of annoying the engineer and causing frequent stoppages. For a variation of this program freight-ears and cabooses, and the like, are left standing upon the track, mid tho delay thus occasioned has caused the Halilmore it Ohio to arrive in Philadelphia all the way from one to four hours behind time. This, however, has been made up on the splendid track of tho main line of the Haltlmnre & Ohio, and, though trains have been late at times, It has very rarely ex ceeded mi hour. With freight-trains this program of obstruction has been more favor able In Its results to (he rival road, and a se rious blockade was created. The Baltimore <Sc Ohio, as Is well known, does u tremen dous freight business, and from the West at (Idsseason of tho year tho'volmno of its freight equals If not exceeds any of tho trunk lines. The principle of llio course of tho Pennsylvania appears to he that of tho “dog In the mangerj’—lt practically says to the shippers of tho West, If you won’t ship by our line, your goods shall not go In or come out of New Vork. Tho Pennsylvania has for many years, in fact from the date of its existence, controlled Hie business between tho East and the West, via Philadelphia and Atlantic coast cities. .So long has this monopoly remained undis puted Hint now the Baltimore iS: Ohio has become the most powerful competitor iu the entire territory, there appears to ho no end to tho chagrin mid .malice of tho old line. .Some days ago tho Halthnore & Ohio was forced, owing to the trouble at Philadelphia, to give notice to shippers Umt it could take no more New York freight; this was a tem porary protection ngaliisithe further increase of the blockade, and to allow the road a brief time to perfect its arrangements for the transportation of this New York freight by other channels. Yesterday tho line was again opened through toNewYork, tho road putting on a line of steamships between IJul tlmore and New York. Tho water-front of tho Halthnure & Ohio In Baltimore Is the must extensive owned ami controlled by any one corporation In Baltimore. Fur years the road has done Its emigrant business ut tho wharves at Locust Point, emigrants stepping from Hie steamers to Hie trains of the H. x 0. on the wharves. Tho freight-sheds at Locust Point are very extensive uud of a capacity to accommodate an immense amount ot freight, (ho tracks of the road reaching to ttio water front are entirely Independent of tho tracks through the city, amt tho facilities for tho handling of freight arc nil that could be de sired. The trains will be run directly to tho steamers, and, where It is necessary not to change built, llio curs can bo run upon the ship and carried through to New York City Intact. The regular time of steamers between Hai.imore and New York is from thirty-six to forty hours, and this time can usually be made by tho H. &. O.'s Line. At ordinary seasons of tho year twenty-four hours is a good average lime for freight by rail be tween Baltimore and New York, but now, with Hie exceedingly crowded condition of tho tracks, there is no doubt but what tho freight of the Baltimore it Ohio sent to New Vork by water from Baltimore will reach that city In advance of the freight sent by any lino all rail,—certainly It wilt be handled much more expeditiously, as tho freight-yards In New York are literally so choked up that freight is liable to remain far some days alter ar rival before it can bo reached intho'cars. The passenger trains over tho new lino wilt be continued as before, and such lime as is lost through Hie obstacles placed on tho Junction Hoad by tho Pennsylvania will bo made up on tho main branch of tho line. •'iVL'* CKIiUINAIj 11EC0BD. lutorcßtlus Horn* from ttio Police Sta tion.
