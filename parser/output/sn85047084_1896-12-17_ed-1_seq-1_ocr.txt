Minister Henry E. Cooper Dined in Washington and Calls on McKinley. WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 7. Pres ident Grover Cleveland's message was presented to Congress this morning. Perhaps the most interesting portion of the message is that relating to the debts due the Government by the Pa cific bond-aided railroads. In plain language the President says it is time that proceedings were taken to collect these debts, by foreclosure if neces sary. Former sentiments on questions re lating to the- tariff and currency are repeated, and foreign relations are re viewed at length. There is just a shadow of warning to Turkey on the subject of Armenian outrages. These significant words- are used: "The pres ent somber prospect in Turkey will not be long permitted to offend the sight of Christendom." The President says the Cuban insur gents have not yet proved their claim to be recognized as belligerents, but that the independence of the island will be the only final settlement of the war fare that is now blighting the "Gem of the Antilles." The message opens with- congratu latory remarks as to the outcome of the recent election, and the "peaceful obedience and manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opinions." Cuba is given the greatest promi nence. The following extracts are made: "The insurrection in Cuba still con tinues with all its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made toward the pa cification of the island or that the sit uation of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has in the least im proved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports, and all the considera ble towns the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the isl and country. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time and is evinced by her unhesi tating devotion of largely increased military and naval forces to the task, there is much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers and character and resources and are none the Iessinflexible in their re-solve not to succumb without prac tically securing the great object for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her author ity neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent State. Indeed, as the contest has gone on, the pretense that civil government exists on the island, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it. has been practically abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a Government, more or less im perfectly, in the large towns and their immediate suburbs. But, that excep tion being made, the entire country is either given over to anarchy or is sub ject to the military occupation of one or the other party. It is reported, in deed, on reliable authority-, that at the demand of the commander-in-chief of the insurgent army the putative Cuban Government has now given up all at tempt to exercise its functions, leaving that Government confessedly (what that is is the best reason for supposing it always to have been in fact), a Gov ernment merely on paper. "No other great power,-it may safely be said, under circumstances of similar perplexity, would have manifested the same restraint and the same patient endurance. It may also be said that this persistent attitude of tne United States toward Spain in connection with Cuba unquestionably evinces no slight respect and regard for Spain on the part of the American people. They in truth do not forget her connection with the discovery of the Western Hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the great qualities of the Spanish peo ple, nor fail to fully recognize their splendid patriotism and their chival- ; rous devotion to the national honor. j "When the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurgents has . become manifest and it is' demonstrat ed that her sovereignty is extinct in ' Cuba for all purposes of its rightful ' ex'stence. and when a hopeless strug- ; Igle for its re-establishment has degen erated into a strife which means noth ing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject matter of the con flict, a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereign ty of Spain will be superseded by high er obligations which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. Deferring the choice of ways and meth ods until the time for action arrives, we should make them depend upon the precise conditions then existing, and they should not be determined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration involving our honor and interest or the international duty we owe to Spain. When we face the con tingencies suggested or the situation is by other incidents imperatively changed, we should continue in the line of conduct heretofore pursued, thus in all "circumstances exhibiting our obedience to the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty enjoined upon us by the position we occupy in the family of the nations. "A contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation either through a careless disregard of present duty or even an undue stimulation and ill timed expression of feeling. But I have deemed it not remiss to remind the Congress that a time may arrive when a correct policy and care for our in terests, as well as a regard for. the interests of other nations and their cit izens, joined by considerations of hu manity, and a desire to see a rich and fertile country, intimately related to us, saved from complete devastation, will constrain our Government to such action as will subserve the interests thus involved and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an opportunity to enjoy the blessings of peace. "The Venezuela boundary question has ceased to be a matter of differ ence between Great Britain and the United States." The reform in the consular service is pronounced a success. The increase in immigration over last year amounted to 84,131. "There arrived from Japan during the year only 1,110 immigrants, antl it is the opinion of the immigration au thorities that the apprehension here tofore existing to some extent of a large immigration from Japan to the United States is without any substan tial foundation." Progress is reported in the protec tion and armament of fortifications along the sea coast. "We should always keep in mind that of all forms of military preparation coast defense alone is essentially pa cific in its nature. While it gives the :;cnse of security due to a conscious ness of strength it is neither the pur pose nor the effect of such permanent fortification to involve us in foreign complications, but rather to guarantee us against them. They are not a temp tation to war, but rather security against it. Thus they are thoroughly in accord with all the traditions of our national diplomacy." Reforms in the postal service are suggested" attention called to guard ing against too generous gifts of pub lic lands; pension rolls have been di minished; civil service reform has made progress; Interstate Commerce Commission has none goou won-:, 'while its wholesome effects are mani fest and have amply justified its en actment, it is evident that all desired reforms and transportation methods have not been fully accomplished. 

TARIFF. T desire to recur to the statements lsewhere made concerning the Gov rnment's receipts and expenditures or the purpose of venturing upon some uggestions touching our present tariff iw and Us operations. 1 his statute ook effect on the 2Sth day of August, $94. Whatever may be its shortcom ings as a complete measure of tariff eform, it must be conceded that it has o pened the way to a freer and greater xchange of commodities between us nd other countries, and thus furnished a wider market for our products and manufacturing. The only entire fiscal year during which this law has been in force ended on the 30th day of June, 1S9G. In that year our imports in creased over tliose of the previous year more than $0,500,000. while the value of the domestic products we ex ported and which found markets abroad was nearly 70,000.000 more than dur ing the preceding year." 

FINANCIAL REFORM. This reference to the condition and prospects of our revenues naturally suggests an allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial methods. They have been frequently pressed up on the attention of Congress in pre vious executive communications and the inevitable danger of their contin ued toleration pointed out. Without now repeating these evils, I cannot re frain from again earnestly presenting the necessity of the prompt reform of a system opposed to every rule of sound finance and shown by experience to be fraught with the gravest peril and perplexity. The terrible Civil War brought in its train the destruction of property, the wasting of our country's substance and the estrangement of brethren. These are now past and for gotten. Even the "distressing loss of life the conflict entailed is but a sacred (Continued on Seventh Page.) ABOUT FILTRATION Report Reatl at Meeting of Board of Heal.

A letter from Mr. Meyers of the Mo- lokai leper settlement, under date of December 4th. gave the information 'hat nine or 10 of the cattle, which ar rived there on November 21st. from Hawaii, had died on the plains without any apparent cause. .Mr. Meyers gave it as his opinion that thirst had prob- ibly caused their death. They had probably not been given water aboard the steamer, and might have swal lowed salt water, a thing that almost always causes death. Such a thing as the death of cattle in such a manner had never happened before at the set tlement. Mr. Meyers, in another letter, re ferred to the matter of fuel used by the nroprietors of coffee shops. The Board decided to write Mr. Meyers to instruct the coffee shop proprietors that their fuel for the purpose of carrying on their business must-be obtained from outside sources. A letter was received from Mr. Geo. Boardman to the effect that he was about to enter into the business of bringing Chinese laborers from the Highest of all in Leavening Power. Latest U. S. Gov't Report I I A kSJ Northern part of China. The writer asked the Board that he be allowed to , bring these Chinamen to Nagasaki, there to be examined by the Hawaiian Government Inspectors, instead of having them sent to Hong Kong, a proceeding that would cost a great deal of money, and be of great difficulty in accomplishing. Mr. Boardman explained that the in habitants of the Northern part of Chi na being agricultural people, would please the planters of the Islands. The matter was deferred until a lat er date, for the purpose of examining further into the matter. Reports from Dr. Eldrlge. Govern ment Inspector in Japan, detailed a startling state of affairs In that coun try in the matter of epidemics of chol era and dysentery. During the week just previous to the departure of the I'elgic for Honolulu there were 153 cases of smallpox and 95 deaths in the city of Kobe, which place had been declared an infected port by the Amer ican Consul. Mr. Connelly. Police Officer Moau was appointed an agent of the Board of Health, for the purpose of being better able to cope with the difficulties arising from the impounding of dogs, he being a mem ber ef the squad appointed to take charge of that work. Mr. C. A. Brown presented his re port on "Filtration." which is given in detail below: HONOLULU. H. I., December 2. 1890. Hon. W. O. Smith. President of Board of Health. Honolulu, Oahu: Sir: At the request of your Board, at a meeting held in June last. I have looked into the matter of filtration of water while on a visit to the United States, and beg to submit the follow ing report. First: While in Boston I met Mr. Quint,, who represents the Norwood Engineer ing Company, which firm manufacture the Wilson water filter. As per agreement, in duplicate, en closed herewith, and marked "A," this firm agree to furnish, f. o. b. San Fran cisco, filters of sufficient capacity to fil ter 2,500,000 gallons of water per day of 24 hours, for the sum of $7,250. This is for a gravity filter. A high pressure filter for same capacity would cost $10,000, the freight and insurance from San Francisco to Honedulu to be paid by this Government or bureau. In addition to this, there would be an expense of $150 a month for an expert to come out and put up the filters. All expense of foundations anrl building to be paid for by this Govern ment. As per letter market "B," you will see that this firm claim that the filters they put In will do the work In 18 hours, so that you could be sure of over 3,000.000 gallons in 24 hours. Tn connection with this bid. I en close a blue print marked "C." this shows the arrangements of their grav ity filters with brick tanks. "D" f-howK the same with iron tanks. "E" shows the arrangements of the six gravity filter beds, constructed ef brick and ecrnent. for which they offer to fur nish for $7,250. At invitation of Mr. Ouip I visited several paper mills in Holyoke. Mass., where they have a number ef their filters in operation, and found that they were furnishing' a perfectly white and clean water. Samples of this water as taken out of the river and when filtered will arrive on next steamer; also samples of the sand and ef quartz used by them. "F" shows their high pressure fil ters with iron tanks 10 feet In diam eter. "G" is a picture of the valve3 used in their filters. "H" is a picture of a top and side view of three filters set in. brick. In envelope marked "I" is a sample of the valve used In their filters. In box . "J", will be found a sample of sand used In several of their filters. T next met Mr. W. B. Nye of the Cumberland Manufacturing Company, who manufacture the Warren patent filter. His letter marked No. 1 gives ome of the main features of their filter. They agree to furnish eight filters with a capacity of 2,500,000 gallons in 21 hours for $11,500, f. o. b. on deck at San Francisco. The expense of freight, insurance, an expert at $150 a month and construction of the foundation and building to be paid by the Board of Health. This firm advise the use of a coagu lant to make a much whiter and purer water, the cost r;f same is noted in their letter marked No. 2.
