Dec 13, la. m.— Sir Edward Clarke. K-Solicitor General, is such high authority on international law that special significance Is attached to his address before the Junior Con stitutional Club last night on the question of how to deal with anarchism. He admitted that there were great difficulties In the way of an attempt to deal with the matter from an inter national point of view. At the same time he saw no reason why England should not enter Into ■ conference with the United States and other nations m order to see whether there was any means by which legislation on the subject might be strengthened. One serious complaint to be made against Great Britain was, he said. in regard to extradition. It had always been »trongly contended that, although the British Government was prepared to surrender per sons guilty of commonplace offences, it could not do so in case of political offences. He. how ever, did not recognize murder as a political of fence, and he thought the civilized nations of the world might agree to making such altera tion in international law as would lead to the surrender of those whose political movements look the form of assassination. Lard Kitche.nc has followed up his dispatch on the siibjfcT of the shooting at Kaffirs by the Boers with another on the conduct of the Boers to Urn ririMth wounded In the action with Ben ajaa'aj column at Brakenlaagte. The evidence aeerr,F pretty conclusive that many men were more r<r l^ss < ruelly treated, and Colonel Ben eor. himself mm apparently not respected. The ,Tion of this state of things is to be found DO arrived at by Major Young. who BMfcea a report that, though the Boer com mandants have the will, they no longer have thp Dim l to repress outrage and murder on the part of their subordinates. Notwithstanding the storm of wind and rain, a Jarge crowd gathered yesterday afternoon In front of the Royal Exchange, to listen to the reading of the royal proclamation announcing the date of the coronation. The Lord Mayor »nd sheriffs, who were attired in gorgeous robes of office, were in attendance, accompanied by several members of the City Corporation. The ■common crier stood bravely forward, heedless •of the peJting shower, and began with "Oyez! Cyez! Oyez!" that could have been heard nearly a hundred yards away. He then proceeded to read the proclamation, fixing Thursday. June £6, 11K»2, as the day for the coronation, and concluded with a stentorian cry of "God save the King:" to which the crowd, bareheaded, re sponded with three ringing cheers. Two further proclamations were also read, and after re newed cheers for the King the Lord Mayor and sheriffs led the crowd in singing the national anthem. The ceremony occupied only a quarter •of an hour. Russia Is not satisfied with her already great j progress as a food exporting nation, and to-day <» deputation of thirty-two Russian agriculturists ■m by the aid of their government, arrive in 'London to study the English markets and learn | English want.-;. The delegates are estate own ers and wholesale producers, who are in the '■^Russian export trade. Their leader, Kruekoff, Us believed to be an extremely able man. '.

IJeutenant Colonel Quayle-Jones. who until or- Berefi to England to receive a colonel's commission •was in charge of the. Boer prisoners at Bermuda, arrived here on the steamer Pretoria from Bermuda yesterday on his way to England. He declared em phatically that the stories that the Boer prisoners •were not treated kindly, that they were in need of clothing: and that they were rot properly fed. were without foundation. "The clothing and food is ex cellent," he added. "Every day each prisoner re ceives one pound or fresh meat, three-quarters of a pound of preserved meat, one and one-quarter jtouads of bread, one pound of biscuit, two-thirds of an ounce of coffee and two ounces of sugar. They cook their own food. There are regular camp kitchens where they may cook if they desire, or they may cook anywhere else they wish to. They sire housed in tents, seven to a tent, and beds are provided for them, with blankets. But they are not obliged to sleep in the tents. They may sleep In the open air if they wish. If any one desires to send them things, such as tobacco, books and luxu ries, all right, but they do not lack the necessaries pi life. Books would be a good thing to send them." , NATIVES IN THE TRANSVAAL. Pretoria. Dec. 12.— Four proclamations relat ing- to natives have been issued here.

AX rLTTMATTTM FOR BULGARIA RECOM • MENDED. Constantinople. Dec. 12.— The latest informa tion regarding Miss Ellen M. Stone, the Ameri can missionary, and lime, Tsilka, her com panion, indicates that their condition has been so far ameliorated that they are able to obtain rude comforts. It is even said that the brigands have a doctor ready at hand in case his services are needed. It apv ars that the brigands are now com plaining that Miss Stone is attempting to con vert them to Christianity. While recognizina tfce Illegality ot tne abduction of Miss Stone and lime. Tsilka. the brigands contend that their action was in the interest of a sacred cause and therefore justifiable. The brigands, apparently, are prepared to hold out all winter. They refuse to abate their de mands one dollar, and have not vouchsafed a reply to Mr. Dickinson's ultimatum to the effect that they must accept his last offer or nothing. It is believed in well informed circles, however, that were the gold actually proffered at some n the border, like Kleshnitza or Yakoruda. within easy reach of the hiding place, by an accredited emissary, the brigands would reduce the amount of the ransom. It is understood here that recommendations have been forwarded to Washington proposing that an ultimatum be sent to Bulgaria. MARCOXIS BALLOOX GOXE. IT BROKE FROM ITS MOORINGS AXD DRIFTED SEAWARD. St. John's. N. F., Dec. 12.— The trial balloon used by William Marconi, the inventor of wireless teleg raphy, who is here conducting experiments with Me system, broke from Its moorings last night and drove away seaward. The accident is not uncommon, and occasions little annoyance. The Inventor is prepared for such emergencies. Mr. Marconi spent the day in testing the velocity of the wind with kites. He will sr-nu up a second balloon to-morrow, taking precautions against a repetition of last night's accident. The inventor explains that he is not. as yet. familiar with the weather and climatic conditions here, which are partly Sue to the unusual elevation from which r.:s experiments are conducted. He is hopeful that to-morrow's experiments will be attended with better success. A dispatch from St. John's. N. F.. on D»c»mbr-r 10 said that Marconi had that afternoon succeeded In floating a balloon two hundred feet above the summit of Signal Hill, which is six hundred fe« I high and overlooks the harbor of St. John's. This balloon was fastened by a series of stays, which rendered it almost motionless. It held up the ver tical steel wire which is used in tbe system Of wireless telegraphy in communicating with distant ships. SUGGESTS KITES FOR MARCONI. W. A. EDDY BELIEVES THAT THEY WILL INCREASE THE SCOPE OF WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY MANY FOLD. Bayonne. N. J. Dec. —William A. Eddy, who arrived from Noanck. Conn., to-day, says that he writes to Mr. Marconi to-night, inclosing diagrams of an improved tandem kite system for reaching a height of 3,000 feet with General Baden-Powell's kites. He thinks his system will enable Marconi to «end messages at least one thousand miles, because every increase in height has so fax much increased the range of wireless messages. Mr. Eddy says he thinks that if the receiving vessel two thousand miles out at sea would also send up a receiving wire by means of kite storm flyers to a height of three thousand feet, the one thousand mile limit would be more than doubled. General Baden-Powell. Mr. Eddy says, fastens one kite to the back of another when flying the kites tandem but with the Improved system of fastening radiating lines to a main line the safety would be greater than with one kite, because if one kite gave out the others would sustain the apparatus.

Paris, Dec 12.— The Chamber of Deputies to-day began the discussion of the Public Worship esti mates, which, in spite of the government's opposi tion, the Budget Commission proposes to suppress. M. Millevoye. Nationalist Republican, opened the debate, which will probably last three sessions, opposing the suppression of the estimates and de manding that the House respect the Concordat. He said their suppression would be not merely a religious but a political and social revolution, and an act of spoliation of Catholics. The Abbe Lemire. Christian Socialist, pointed out that the Public Worship b-Jdget did not pro vide for the salaries of the clergy, but provided an indemnity, and. he added, if the budget was suppressed it would provoke civil war throughout France.

N-EW-TORK DAILY TRTBrXE. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 13. 1901. CHILI AND ARGENTINA. THE SITUATION STRAINED— CHILI'S AN SWER EXPECTED AT BUENOS AYRES TO-DAY. Buenos Ayrea. Dec. 12.-Th«" relations between Chill and the Argentina Republic are strained. Chili has not yet replied to the demand for the construction of strategic roads In the litigated territory. The Chilian answer to this demand will be given to-morrow. The Argentine Gov ernment believes the Chilian answer will be satisfactory. A part of the press, however, doubts this. In the mean time, both countries are taking protective measures, although the Argentine Republic has not yet mobilized the militia. .- In case Chili's reply is not favorable the Argentine will withdraw her Minister from San tiago de Chili, and the antecedents and history of the misunderstanding will be forwarded to Great Britain for arbitration. Chill Is busily engaged in buying warships, timing to surpass the power of the Argentine fleet. Commercial circles here hope the Influence o. the Pope will prevent a conflict of arms between the two countrtes. Calm reigns here. There have been no warlike manifestations, but all parties are united In support of the government. The Argentine and foreign newspapers pub lished here unanimously counsel the Argentine Government to maintain its present energetic The Argentine Government yesterday deposit ed in London f2.i00.000. to insure the payments of the coupons of the Argentine debt.

Dec. 12.— Secretary Hay has re ceived cable dispatches from Minister Lord, at Buenos Ayres, and Minister Wilson, at Santiago de Chili, stating in effect that, while the situa tion is extremely grave, the best opinion is that war between Chili and Argentina will not follow. London, Dec 12.— "The Times," in Its second edi tion to-day, publishes a dispatch from Valparaiso, under to-day's date, which says: The first symptom at the present juncture of a possible awakening of warlike excitement among the Chilian public Is the announcement that a mass meeting, of working people is to be held at San tiago December 15. to express approval of the action of the government in dealing with the Ar gentine question. Even this, apparently, is merely an offset to another meeting, promoted by the ad vocates of peace at any price. The buying of ships to take the place of vessel* of questionable efficiency, the mobilization of the fleet for manoeuvres and the strengthening of rela tions with friendly neighbors. Colombia and Ecua dor, are not regarded here as signs of aggressive intentions on Chili's part, but only as natural pre cautions evoked by the unexpectedly threatening demeanor of Argentina. 

GERMANY AND MONROE DOCTRINE. Berlin. Dec. 12.— Some commotion has b«?en caused in the press here by the publication of cable despatches from New-York to the effect that Washington considers incorrect the Ger man official view of that passage In President Roosevelt's Message containing hi? definition of the Monroe Doctrine, which is here construed as permitting thr collection by force of private elaimr- against South American countries. Th« "Tages Zeitung" says: if Germany found it necessary to occupy a Venezuelan r ir 'rt she would not ask Ur.< !c i permission to do so. TO EX 

LARGE STEEL PLANTS. PLANS OF UNITED STATES STEEL CORPO RATION TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREATEST TINPLATE PRO DUCER IN THE WORLD. Pittsburg, Dec 12— "The Chronicle-Telegraph" says to-day that some extensive Improvement? and enlargements of the various plants of the United States Steel Corporation have just been decided upon by the advisory board of the big steel com bination. It has been developed that th« sole ob ject of the inspection tour of President C. M. Schwab and other officer;- last month was to con sider suggestions made by the district managers. The most Important action of the board was a de cision largely to incrrase the tee] producing ca pacity of the corporation, as the output of finished material is far in advance of that of the bessemer converters and or en hearth plants. One of the plans is to equip all the open hearth furnaces of the Carnegie Steel Company at Duquesne that the steel may be made by the MoneU process, which has already proved so suc cessful at Homestead. It is estimated that th* monthly output can be Increased thousands of tons by adopting this process at all the open hearth plants of the company. ■ It has been decided by the American Sheet Steel Company to Install additional mills for the rolling of heavier gauges, and the work is to be begun at a number of the plants in a short time. The American Tin Plate Company 'will also In the near future install machinery lor the rolling of black plates for tin mills that will be largely auto matic. It is said on good authority that machinery in this process will do from two-thirds to three fourths of the work now done by hand in the hot mills, and the output will be greatly increased. With the nr-w method it is estimated that the American Tin Plate Company will be able to com pete with foreign manufacturers without the aid of the tariff, which would result in the United States becoming the greatest tinplatc manufactur ing country in the world.

Guiteau, the assassin of President Garfleld, was insane. In an address before- the Unitarian Club here last even- Ing, cam* to public notice to-day. Dr. rhanninc. speaking on "The Treatment of Anarchy." said that all anarchists were dencgerates. but that pub lic opinion had great influence upon decisions as to their mental condition. Dr. Chsnnlng said; As an export In the Guiteau trial I have some reason to know how much the expression of one's personal opinion is influenced by public opinion I knew that Guiteau was insane, and so did a few other experts, but we raised our voices so feebly that it looked as if we had no positive conviction about It. It was wonderful how anxious we were every day to find him sane. Czolgosz ultimately will probably be put in the same category with Gutteau. J. Wilkss Booth was probably insane, and was made use of as a tool by others. .-:■■■«;--:-.;■ .

Phoebe, sixteen years old; Lizzie, twelve years old. and Benjamin, nine years old, went to the pond to skate. The two younger children got their skates on first and started out. The older girl had helped them, and while she was putting on her own skates, she was startled by screams from her brother and sister. Looking up, she saw them floundering in the water at the deepest part of the pond. She started to their assistance, but when she reached the edge of the hole the ice gave way beneath her, and she found herself in the water with them. She grabbed her sister and brotner and tried to g-.-t them wheie they could hold on to the edges of the ice until help came Her «=creams attracted the attention of a neighbor, John Picoe, who ran to their assistance. Be fore he could reach them, however, the elder girl became exhausted from her efforts in try ing to keep the younger children afloat, and an ThVfee was so thin and rotten that it was necessary to lay boards to get to the spot where the children went down. Grappling irons were secured, and the bodies were found in a short time. The old-r girl held the brother and sister closely clasped in her arms. KILLED REPAIRING CUPOLA.
