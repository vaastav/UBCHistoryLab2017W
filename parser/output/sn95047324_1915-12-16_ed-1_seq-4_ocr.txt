In the opinion of the Eagle, the word "preceding," as used in the above section, renders the whole taw foolish and inoperative. The Herald hack noticed that word in the newspaper publica tions of IW law, out thought it was a printer's error and, there fore, gave it no attention, Bui the Eagle, believes that the law contains that identical word and that it is placed right where it ap pears in the section above quoted. If the official copy of the law, signed by the presiding officers f the house and the senate and y the governor, now on file in Tallahassee, should show that the word "preceding" is used as ap pears above, then, of course, the 'aw is a piece of utter foolishness ind has no force whatever.

Don't stand in the. door-way, drat ye I You ought to have bet ter sense. Frank. Harris, veteran editor of the Ocala Banner, gets more newspaper boquets than any oth er editor in the state, and he" de serves them all," The esteemed Tampa Tribune is firing original poetry at the ed itor of The Herald. But it doesn't hurtonly it is too hyper catalectic to fit ill these columns. The Ocala Star says that Bud Fisher ran out of originality long ago, adding that "hia recent out break of Mutt and Jeff atrocities have been supplied with reading matter not only from ante-bellum times, but antediluvian times." What's in a name? Pearl White is to be hung at Palatko Dec. 31st inst. But this Pearl if not the delineator of Elaine. Editor Hanna Persists The State Educational Associa tion will meet in Tallahassee Dec. 28th inst. Hope the member will unite in a pledge to study English composition during 1916. Sunday's Pensacola Journal preaches an able editorial on Sab bath observance; says we are all going to hell as Spain did, be cause we devote the Sabbath to frolics and festivities of all kinds. instead of to the worship of God. The Journal is more than half correct. . The Fort Lauderdale Herald -cordially approves, the wretch whonUr-tfrT coat shirt, say ing that he "should havo a place in the hall of fame right close up to George Washington's." We be grudge the wretch even this one good friend. . It should be remembered by al advertisers that, at the October meeting of the various Florida press associations, it was decided that on and after Jany. 1st, 1916: the minimum rate for weekly newspapers having a circulation of from 500 to 1,000, should be 15c an inch. Over at West Palm Beach, on Sunday evening, 5th inst., Walter F. Hudson, a watchman, looked over into an automobile standing iieariW sidewalk and a bulldog lying in the car immediately tore the man's face off and disfigured him for life. Bulldogs are love ly and harmless pets. - r . a . i juany oi tne newspapers are now "doing themselves proud" by issuing huge, beautiful Christ mas editions. The Velusia Coun ty Record issued one on the 10th and the Tampa Tribune put forth a journalistic Christmas colossus on Sunday, The Tribune is good and big enough ordinarily, but its special editions are simply overwhelming. The San ford Herald proposes Hon." Joseph N. Whitner of Semi nole county, for commissioner of agriculture; and, from what it says about him, we conclude that Ire iff "admirably fitted for the of fice. Further, we believe he is the only man thus far mentioned for that office who would stand any chance of winning over the present incumbent, who is an ex- nert politician. If Senator Bak er oi burnter county, declines to Tin, The Punta Gorda Herald iill give what influence it has to Ir Whitner. i W. E. Griffis, a capable newspa per man who is well known . in Lee and DeSoto counties, has bought and taken charge of the Jasper Banner of Liberty. The Herald wishes him the greatest success, although he starts out by accusing Gilchrist of trying to "swipe" the vote of Perry Wall's kindred in Hamilton county. Now what obscures our com prehension is just this considera tion: without the credit of the State behind the bonds," they are lot bonds, or, what is the same ihing, not salable as such; they ire only handsome pieces of lith- igraphed paper, worth DerhaDs 15 cents per hundred, and not e- nough profit from the sale of such uticles could be realized to drain me acre. Wo draining will - be lone, consequently, and the State vill be failing to carry out its es- ablished policy of draining the 'Glades, to which it has long been lommitted, and which 

MUST- be sompleted some day. A scheme o compel avoidance of such a 'ailure seems good to us. In the second place, The Her- ild doubtless knows that farmers ire only settling in and cultivat- ng the territory where supposed ly adequate canals have already ieen bzuilt. If these canals fad it the first severe test, then surely he state officials under whose mpervision they were constructed md are maintained are responsi ve, and the "land-sharks" arc loing good work in directing in- lignation wehre it belongs. Au- jurndale News. Surely Editor Hanna knows that the legislature authorized the State Drainage Board, to issue )0uds for Everglades drainage ind to place back of these bonds those lands that would be benefit- d by drainage. In other words, the bonds arc to be a mortgage "fail at the first which "surely the state J1 are responsible," By V. reasoning jf a toinadJ tear im roof off fcditori ,ma's office, h? architect who Vlanned and built the office should be mane ; v nt- ernnient'eifgin'ers ought to be re quired toV pay for tWV havoc wrought by the overflows of the Ohio, Arkansas, Mississippi and Caloosahatchee rivers.
