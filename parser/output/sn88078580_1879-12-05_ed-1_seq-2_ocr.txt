CourU for the District of Oregon, in suita ble cases, will, t a proper time, be sub mitted to Congress. . The attention of Congress is called to the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the condition of thejublic finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal vear ended June 30th, 1S79. were $273,82? ,l4 46 ; tiie ordinary expen ditures for the same period were $2C64", 8S3 53 ; leaving a surplus revenue for the year, of $6,879,300 93. The receipts of the present fiscal year, endine June 30th, 18S0, actual and esti- - mated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter commencing Jnly 1st, 1889, $79,843,663 61 ; estimated receipts for the remaining three quarters of t he year, $208,156,336 39; total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and estimat ed, $288,000,000. . . The expenditures for the same period, actual and estimated, as follows : t or tue quarter commencing July 1st. 18.9, actcal expenditures, $91,63,35 16; and for he remaining three quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at fli-.-Jie,-614 90. making the total exyenditures r4,000 000. and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for the year ending June 86th, 1880, of $24,000,000. The total re ceipts during the next fiscal year ending Jnnp smh. 1881. estimated according to ex isting laws, will be $238,000,000; and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same period will be $273,0H7364 39, leav ing a surplus of $9,902,635 61 for that year. The large amount expended for arears of pensions during the last and the present . . . . Ant OKI tin nseal year, amounting to j:i,him , has prevented the application of the full amount required by law to the sinking fund for the current year; but these ar rears having been substantially paid, it is believed that the sinking fund can here after be maintained without any change of exisjing law. The Secretary of War reports that the War Department estimates for the fiscal vear endine June 30th. 1881, are $40,380,- 428 93. the same being for a less sum of money than any annual estimate render ed to Uongres8 irom mat department dur ing a period of at least twelve years. He concurs with the General of the Army in recommending such legislation as will authorize the enlistment of the full number of 25,000 men for the line of the army, exclussve of the 3,463 men re quired lor detached duty, and therefore not available for service in the field. He also recommends ' that Congress be asked to provide by law for the disposi tion of a large number of abandoned mili tary posts and reservations which, though verv valuable in themselves, have been rendered useless for military purposes by the advance of civilization and settle ment. He unites with the Quartermaster Gen eral m recommending that an appropria tion be made for the construction of a cheap and perfectly fire-proof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of monev accounts, voucners, claims ami other valuable records now in the Quar termaster General's office, and exposed to mat risk of total destruction by hre. He also recommends in conformity with the views of the Judge Advocate General, some declaratory legislation in reference to the military statute of limita tions as applied to the crime ot aesertion. In these several recommenuauons concur. THE 

EADS PASS. The War reports that the work for the improvement of the South Pass of the Mississippi river, un der contract with Mr. James B. Eads, made in pursuance or an act of Congress, has been prosecuted during the past year, with a greater measure of success in the attainment of results than during any previous year. The channel throueh the South Pass, which, at the beginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only 7 and one-halt feet ot water, had, on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of twenty-six feet, having a width of not less than 200 feet and a central depth of thirty feet Payments have been made in accordance with the statute, as the work progressed, amounting in the aggregate to $4,250,000; and further payments will become due, as proviuea uy the statute, in the event of success in maintaining the channel now sec urea. The reports of the General of the Army and of his subordinates, present a full and detailed account of the military op erations for the suppression of hostilities among the Indians of the Ute and Apache tribes, and praise is justly awarded to the officers and troops engaged, for prompt ness, skill and courage displayed. The past year has been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet on the Mexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of this Government and of Mexico to maintain order in that region will prove permanently successful. This Department was enabled during the past year to una temporary, though crowded accommodations, and a safe de pository for a portion of its records, in the completed east wing of the building de signed for the State, War, and Navy De partments. Ihe construction of. the north wing of the building, a part of the struc ture intended for the use of the War De partment, is being carried forward with all possible dispatch, and the work should receive from Congress such liberal appro priations as will secure its speedy comple THE NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows continued improvement in that branch of the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs have been made upon vessels, and two new ships have been completed and made ready for sea. The total expenditure of the year ended June 30th, 1879, including specific appro priations not estimated for by the depart ment, were $13,o5o,710.uy. Ihe expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting the amount of the specific appropriations were $13,343,317.79; but this is subject to reduction of $283,725.99. that amount having been drawn upon warrants, but pot paid out during the year. The amount of appropriations applicable to the last fiscal year was $14,538,646.17. There was, therefore, a balance of $1,479,05437 re maining unexpended, and to the credit of the Department, on June 50tn, 1879. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 80th, 1881, are $14,864,147.95, which ex ceeds the appropriations for the present fiscal year $361,897.28. The reason for this increase is explained in the Secretary's report. The appropriations available for the present hscal year are $14,502,250.67, which will, in the opinion of the Secretary, answer all the ordinary demands of the service. The amount drawn from the Treasury from July 1st to November 1st, 1879, was $5,770,404.12, of which $1,095, 440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period $4,674,963.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two thirds of a year do not exceed the propor tion for these four months, there will re main unexpended, at the end of the year, $477,359.30 of the current appropriations. The reDort of the Secretary sh owe t h irrft H. fymg fact that among all the disbursing omcars oi me pay corps or the navy there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with him in recommending the removal of the Observ story to a more healthful location. That institution renects credit upon the Nation, and has obtained the approbation of sci entific men in all parts of the world. Its removal from its present location would not only be conducive to the health of its officers and professors, but would greatly increase lis useiuiness. UNITED STATES MARSHALS. The appropriation for judicial expenses. which has heretofore been made for the Department of Justice in gross, was sub divided at the last session of Congress, and uu rr t uriLc , oi WRjS made lor OtA nflvmAnt nf t.h fees rf A1.,..t... i . , t J . -umouaia HUU their deputies, either in the service of pro- ws w vi viueruuues; and since June 30tb, these officers have Anntlnnul t ha nrt nrinu n ra rtt thai A.,ti j,.... . .... v.iw, without compensation from the Govern ment, ta&iug upuu luemseiyes me neces sary incidental outlays, as well as render i . k -; ; i i ayoidable instances has the proper execu tion of tUa ntwioM ,f tha 7 ; ..A " - iiuv iivwo L u u uutcu OLBbCS failed by reason of the absence of the re quisite appropriation. This course of offi cial conduct on the part of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was ad vised by the Attorney, General, who in formed them, however, that they would necessarily have to rely tor their compen sation upon the prospect of future legis lation by Congress. I therefore especially recommend that immediate appropriation be made by Congress for this purpose. The act making the principal appropria tion for the department of Justice at pre vious sessions has uniformly contained the following clause: "A nd for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the en forcement of the act approved February est.h. ifian. pnmiH i.n . j .i 1 ? ' -. " m., i'j oiueuu oil act approved May 30th, 1870,' entitled An act to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of the United States, and for other purposes,' or any act amendatory thereof jr supplementary thereto.' " No appropriation was made for this pur pose for the current year. As no s-eueml . election for members of Con gress occurred, the emission was a matter of little practical iinjiortance. Such elec tion will, however, take place aunug i ensuing year, and the appropriation made for the pay of AUrshalsanuaeuuiiessuo.. be sufficient to embrace compensation for the services they may be required to per form at such elections. THE SUPREME COURT. f huslnpss of the Supreme Court is, at present, largely in arrears. It cannot be expected that more causes can be decided hn arc now disposed of in its annual session, or that by any assiduity the dis tinguished magistrates who compose the court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts of munv of the cir cuits, also the business has increased to such an extent that the delay of Justice will call the attention ol Congress to an nnnmriate remedy. It is believed that all is done in each circuit which can fairly be expected from its judicial force. The evil arising from delay are less heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors, as its causes are advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve the discussion of questions of a public char acter. The remedy suggested by the Attorney ueneral is the appointment of APDmOSAL 

CIRCUIT JUDGES, and the creation of an intermediate Court of Errors and Appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part of its juris diction, while a larger force is also obtain ed for the performance of circuit duties. I commend this suggestion to the con sideration of Congress. It would seem to afford a complete remedy, and would in volve, if ten additional Circuit Judges are appointed, an expenditure, at the present rate of salaries, of no more than $00,000 a year, which would certainly be small in comparison with the objects to be at tended. THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT. The report of the Postmaster General bears testimony to the general revival of business throughout the country, the receipts of the Post-Office Department for the hscal year ended June 6VLb, 1879, were $30,041,982.86, being $764,465.91 more than the revenues of the preceding year. The amount realized from the sale of post age stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards, was $764,465.91 more than in the preceding year, and $2,387,559.23 more than in 1877. The expenditures of the Departmentwere $i 449,899. 45, of which the sum ot f dib, 461.03 was paid on Iiabili ties incurred in preceding years. The expenditures during the year were $801,209.77 less than in the preceding year. This reduction is to be attnbuted mainly to the operation of the law passed June 17th, 1878, changing the compensation of postmasters from a commission on the value ot stamps sold to a commission on stamps canceled. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations in addition to the reve nues of the department was $3,031,454.96, being $2,276,197.86 less than in the pre ceding year. The expenditures for the preceding year ending June 3Uth, 1881, are estimated at $39,920,900, and the receipts from all sources at $32,210,000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for out of the Treasury -of $7,710,900. The relations of the department with railroad companies have been harmonized. notwithstanding the general reduction by Congress of their compensation, by the ap propriation for special facilities, and the railway post-office lines have been greatly extended, especially in the Southern States. The interests of the railway mail service and of the public wouid be greatly promot ed, and the expenditures could be more readily controlled, by the classification of employes of the railway mail service as recommended by the Postmaster General, the appropriation for salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be made in gross. The Postmaster General recommends an amendment of the law regulating the in crease of compensation for increased ser vice and increased speed on star routes, so as to enable him to advertise for proosa!s for such increased service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to the commerce of the country fromAhe en actment or a general law authorizing con tracts with American built steamers, carry ing the American flag, for transporting the mail between ports of the United orates, and ports oi the Y est Indies and South America at a fixed maximum price per mile, the amount to be expended being regulated by annual appropriations, in like manner with the amount paid for the do mestic siar service. 

BOOKS IN THE FOREIGN MAILS. The arrangement made by the Post master ueneral and the Secretary of the Treasury for the collection of duty upon books received in the mail from foreign countries have proved so satisfactory in its practical operation that the recommenda tion is now made that Congress shall ex tend the provision of the act of March 3d. 1879, under which this arrangement was made, so as to apply to all other dutiable articles received m the mails from foreign THE INDIANS. The reports of the Secretary of the In terior and the Commissioner of Indian Af fairs, setting forth the present state of our relations with the Indian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance their civilization and prosperity, and the progress already achieved by them will be iouhq oi more man ordinary interest. The general conduct of our Indian popula tion has been so satisfactory that the oc currence of two disturbances, which re sulted in bloodshed and destruction of property, is all the more to be lamented. RECENT OUTBREAKS. of the outbreak on the White River Ute reservation in Western Colorado has become so familiar by elabo rate reports in the public press that its re markable incidents need not be stated here in detail. It is expected that the settle ment of this difficulty will lead to such ar rangements as will prevent further hostile contacts between the Indians and the bor der settlements in Western Colorado. The other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero Agency, in New Mexico, where v ictoria, the head of a small band of ma rauders, after committing many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military force, made his way across the Mexican border and is now on foreign soil. While these occurrences, in which a comparatively small number of Indians were engaged, are most deplorably a vast majority of our Indian population have fully justified the expectations of those who believe by humane and peaceful influ ences the Indians can be led to abandon the habits of savage life and to develone a capacity for useful and civilized occupa- nous, n nat iney nave already accom plished in the pursuit of asricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable success which has attended the experiment of em ploying as freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest and most intractable, and the general and urgent desire expressed by them for the education ot their children, may be taken as sufficient proof that they will be found capable of accomplishing much more if they be wisely and fairly guided. The "Indian policy" sketched in the report of fV. c ... . e -u I -. . . , ma udjicLaij ui me iiiienor, roe OUject OI which is to make liberal provision for the education of the Indian youth, to settle me inuians upon larm lot! in severalty, to give them the title in fee to their farms, inalienable for a certain number of years, and when their wants are thus nmvili for, to dispose by sale of the lands on their reservations not occupied and used by them, a fund to be formed out of the pro ceeds for the benefit of the Indians, which will gradually relieve the Government of the expenses dow provided for by annual appropriations, must commend itself as just and beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated to remove those obstruc tions which the existence of large reserva tions presents io me settlement and devel .opement of the country. I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enabling the Government to give In dians a title in fee, inalienable for twenty five years, to the farm lands assigned to them by allotment. I also report the re commendation maue in my first annual message, that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having, by their own labor, supported their families for a number of years, and who are willing to detalch themselves from their tribal relations, to the benefit of the homestead act, and to grant them patents containing the same provision of inaliena bility fcr a certain period. 

EDUCATING THE INDIANS. The experiment of spndinir r nnmhAi nf Indian 'children, of both sexes, to the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Insti tute, in Virginia, to receive an elementary English education and practical instm.- tion in farming and other useful indus tries, has led to results so promising that it was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennslva nia, to the Interior Department for the es tablishment of an Indian school on a larger scale. The school has now ioo pupiis, se lected from various tribes, and is in lull operation. Arrangements are also made tor the education or a numoer oi inaiau boys and girls belonging to tribes on the pHcihc -lope, in a similar manner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institu tions will commend themselves to the lib erality of Congress and to the philanthro pic mumncence or, the American people. Last spring information was received of organization of an extensive movement in the Western States the objeet of which was the occupation by unauthorized per sons of certain land in the Indian Terri tory ceded by the Cherokees to the Govern ment for the purpose of settlemeut by other Indian tribes. On the 29th of April I issued a procla mation warning all persons against par ticipating in such an attempt, and by the co-operation of a military force, the inva sion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect the rights of the Indian inhabitants of that Territory to the full extent of the Executive power. But it would be unwise to ignore the fact that a Territory so large and so fertile, with a population so sparse and so great a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to the repetition of such attempts as happened this year, when the surround ing States are more densely settled, and the westward movements of our popula tion looks still more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under such circum stances the difficulty of maintaining the Indian Territory in its present state will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes in habiting it would do well to prepare for such a contingency. I therefore fully ap prove ol the advice gtven to them ny rue Secretary of the Interior on a recent occa sion, to divide among themselves in sever alty as large a quantity of lands as they can cultivate, toacqmre muiviuuai iiue 111 fee instead of their tribal ownership in common, and to consider in what manner the balance of their lands may be dispos ed of by the Goverement tor their beneht. By adopting such a policy they would more certainly secure for themselves the value of their possessions, and at the same time promote their progress in civilization, than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present state ol things in the lemtory. CHANGING THE CONTROL. The question whether a change in the control of the Indian service should be made was in the Forty-fifth Congress re ferred to a joint committee of both Houses for inquiry and report. In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the decision ot that question, then in prospect, "would arrest further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as wen as me Indians themselves. Since then the committee have reported. the question has been decided in the neg ative by a vote in the House or Kepresen tatives. . For the reason here stated, and in view of the fact that further uncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much needed legislation, to weaken the decipline of the service and to unset tle salutary measures now i l progress for the government and improvement of the Indians. I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived at by Congress at its last session be permitted to stand. 

TIMBER LAND DEPREDATIONS. The efforts made by the Department of the Interior to arrest the depredations on the timber lands of the United States have been continued, and have met with con siderable success. A large number of cases ot trespass have been prosecuted in the Courts of the United States; others have been settled, the trespassers offering to make payment to the Government for the value of the timber taken by them. The proceeds of the prosecutions and set tlements turned into the treasury tar ex ceed in amount the sums appropriated by Congress for this purpose. A more im portant result, however, consists in the fact that the destruction of our public for ests by depredation, although such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in extent, and it is probable that if the pres ent policy is vigorously pursued and suf ficient provision to that end is made by Congress, such trespass, at least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed. except in the Territories where timber for the daily requirements of the popula tion cannot, under the present state of the laws, be otherwise obtained. I therefore earnestly invite the attention of Congress to the recommendation made by the Sec retary of the Interior, that a law be en acted enabling the Government to sell timber from the public lands without con veying the tee, where such lands are prin cipally valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to con form to domestic wants and business re quirements, while at the same time euard- ing against a sweeping destruction ol the forests. The enactment of such a law ap pears to become a more pressing necessity AGRICULTURE. mes sages are renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of the Department of Agri culture. Agriculture is the leading in terest and the permanent industry of our people. It is to the abundance of agri cultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and the largely in creased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, that we are mainly indebted for our present prosperity as a people. We must iook lor its continued maintenance to the same substantial resource. There is no hranch of industerv in which lahor di rected by scientific knowledge, yields such increased production in comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to which the encour agement of liberal appropriations can be more appropriately extended. The omis sion to render such aid is not a wise econ omy; but, on the contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums annual ly that might be saved through well di- rected efforts of the Government to promote this vital interest. The results already accomplished with the very limited means heretofore placed at the command of the Department of Ag riculture is an earnest of what may be ex pected with increased appropriations for the several purposes indicated in the re port of the Commissioner, with a view to placing the Department upon a footing which will enable it to prosecute more effectively the objects for which it is es tablished. Appropriations are needed for a more complete laboratory, for the establishment of a veterinary division, and a division of forestry, and for an increase of force. The requirements for these and other purposes, indicated in the report of the Commissioner under the head of the im mediate necessities of the Department. will not involve any expenditure of money that the country cannot with propriety now undertake in the interests of agricul ture. 

EDUCATION. It is STatifvin? to learn from ths Tin reau of Education the extent to which ed ucational privileges throuchout the United States have been advanced during the year. No more fundamental respon sibility rests upon Congress than that of devising appropriate measures of financial aid to education, supplemental to local ac tion in the States and Territories, and in the .District ol Columbia. I he wise fore thought of the founders of our Govern ment has not only furnished the basis for the support of our common school systems of the newer States, but laid the founda tions for the maintenance of their univer sities and agriculture and the mechanic arts. Measures in accordance with this traditional policy for the further benefit of all these interests, and the extension of the same advantages to every portion of me country, it is hoped, win receive your iuvorauie cousiueraiiun. NATIONAL LITERATURE. To preserve and perpetuate the National literature should be among the foremost cares of the National legislature. The library gathered at the Capitol still re mains unprovided with any suitable ac commodations for its rapidly increasing stores, j ne magnitude and importance of the collection, increased as it is by the Jt j i . . - uepusiis maue unuer me law oi copy right, by domestic and foreign exchanges, and the scientific library of the Smith sonian institution, call for building ac commodations which shall be at once ade quate and fire-proof. The location of such a public building, which should nro- iuc mr iuc pressing necessities oi me present, and lor me vast increase of the Nation's books in the future, ia a matter m hich addresses itself to the discretion of congress. It is earnestly recommended as a measure which should unite all suf frages, and which should no longer be delayed. WASHINGTON MONUMENT. act of Congress of August 2d, 1876, for the purixise of supervising and directing the completion of the Washington National Monument, of which Commission the President is a member, has iriven careful attention to this subject, 'and already the strengthening of the foundation has so far progressed as to insure the entire success of this part of the work. A massive layer of masonry has been Introduced below the original foundation.widening the base. increasing we stauuuy ui we Birunurc, and rendering it possible to carry the shaft to completion. It is earnestly recom mended that such further appropriations to be made for the continued prosecution of the work as may be necessary for the completion of the National monument at an early day. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. In former messages, impressed with the importance of the subject, I have taken occasion to commend to Congress the adaption of a generous policy toward the District of Columbia. The report of the Commissioners of the District, herewith tiansmitted, contains suggestions and recommendations, to all of which I ear nestly invite your careful attention. I ask your early and favorable considera tion of the views which they express as to the urgent need of legislation for the re claimation of the marshes of the Potomac and its eastern branch, within the limits of the city, and for the repair of the streets of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and now by decay rendered al most impassable, and a source of immi nent danger to the health of its citizens. The means at the disposal of the Commis sioners are wholly inadequate tor the ac complishment or these important worss, and should be supplemented by timely appropriations frorh the Federal Treasury. The filling of the flats in front of the city will add to the adjacent lands and parks, not owned by the united states, a large and valuable domain, sufficient it is thought, to reimburse its entire cost, and will also, as. aq incidental result, se cure the permanent improvement of the river for the purpose or navigation. The Constitution having invested Con gress with supreme and exclusive juris diction over the District of Columbia, its citizens must of necessity look to Congress alone for all needful legislation affecting their interests; and as the territory of this district is the common ' property of the people ot the Lnited states, who, equally with its resident citiiena, ape interested in the prosperity of their capital, I cannot doubt that you will be amply sustained by the general voice of the country in any measure you may adopt for this purpose. I also invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the want of the public schools of this district, as exhibited in the report of the commissioners. While the number of pupils is rapidly increasing no adequate provision exists lor a correspon ding increase for school accommodation, and the commissioners are without the means to meet this urgent need. A mini ber of the buildings now used for school purposes are rented, and are, in impor tant particulars, unsuited for the purpose. The cause for popular education in the District of Columbia Is surely entitled to the same consideration at the hands of the National Government as in the several Suites and Territories, to which sufficient grants of the public lands have been made for the endowment of schools and univer RUTHERFORD B. HAYES. Executive Mansion, December 1, 1879. THE TELEGRAPH. The largest paper In Ashtabula, printed en tirely at home. Office 136 Main Street. ASHTABULA. - OHIO Friday Morning:, Dec 5, 1879, Senator Tburman advances the theory that the result in Ohio, was not a rebuke to the course of his party in Congress. Another prominant Republican negro has been assassinated iu South Carolina, but, as usual, politics has nothing to do with it. The hostile White River Utes refuse to come in or surrender those who were en gaged in the White River Agency massa cre. The Commission has failed, there fore, in the important object of its forma tion. There is work for the soldiers. Tne Western Female Seminary, at Ox ford, in this State, has had the honor of furnishing three of her graduates class of 1878, for the missionary field. One of these young ladies Miss Fannie Cundle, of St. Louis, took her departure last week from New York, for her station Tripoli, Syna via London. The other two- Miss Edna S. Cole, of St. Josephs, Mo., and Mary M. Campbell, of Lexington, Ind. took their departure in October of last year, for the Laos Mission, Siam Chang-Mai being the particular locality. These young ladies are said to have been well fitted in scholorship and devoted piety, for the life work to which they have given themselves. Confidence is felt, that they will honor their Alma Mater, while they honor their Master and the cause of religion. The proposition to send Republican stumpers down into Louisiana, is not popularly fallen in with. Neither Sher man or Blaine can find time to attend -to it. Gen. Stewart, L. Woodford, however, who defended Mrs. Chisholin in the trial of Gully, in Mississippi, gallantly steps forward and volunteers to embark in the canvass, and has actually arrived there in furtherance of that design. He reached N. 0. on Tuesday last. The Picayune gives him a rather gingerly reception, but does not exactly welcome him with bloody hands to a hospitable grave. The pro gress of Mr. Woodford will be watched with deep interest. The course ot South era hospitality will, no doubt, be put to its test, as that course will have its influ ence upon public sentiment at the North The case will be a marked one. Congress. The second session of the forty-sixth Congress, convened on Mon day. The opening day proved a very quiet and unimportant one. After listen ing to the reading of the President's Mes sage, both houses adjourned. The full text of the message will be found in this paper. It is more in extenso, than is common with President Hayes. Most of the subjects of National concern are re viewed in that concise, frank and business like manner that characterize the docu ments of our present chief magistrate. Nork enough is laid out for keeping the members out of mischief up to the fourth of March, but it will be two much to ex pect, that it will take precedence of parti san matters. In the language of a Thanksgiving prayer reported to us, it might with propriety be said "Oh Lord if it is not too much to ask, baptise the Congress, about to covene, with a spirit of common sense." There is a priest named Father Scully in Cambridgport, Mass., who enforces the duties of Catholic parents to send their children to the parochial school, by the anathemas of the church ex-communica tion and exposure to perdition. Some of the Catholics send their children to the "Godless," free, public schools" and this course is resorted to, to break up the pat ronage. A case has been recently decid ed in the courts, by heavy verdict, where the institutions of the church were brought to bear upon apostate Catholics, by influ encing his trade and breaking down his business, so that that course was found to be a little expensive. This resort, there fore, of stripping the delinquent of his hopes of salvation, is. no doubt, believed will reach the end without exposure. But the papers tell us that some of the Massa chusetts Catholics find that the public schools are cheaper than the parochial schools, and are of a much higher stan dard and more beneficial to the children. The parents are, therefore, defying Fath er Scully's claims of holding the keys of Heaven, and of admitting or excluding whom he will from the blest abodes. The world is suffering for want of elo quence logic ligh t of the greenback cast of thought. There is any amount of room for electrical light effulgence and the reticence that prevails, is hardly less than reckless indifference. These are try ing times for any one affected with paper monomania, and if there is any panacea laying around loose adapted to meet the emergency, it should, by all means, be brought into active application and opera tion, without undue waste of time.
