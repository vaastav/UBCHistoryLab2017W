Dec. 6 (Speclal).-The exportation of manufactures from the United States continues to show a healthy growth in nearly all Important ar ticles except opp< r and iron and steel. The export figures just made public by the Treasury Bureau of Statistics -how that in the ten months ending with October exports of copper nave fallen about $23,000,000, and of iron and steel about JS.OW.OOa, making a total reduction in these two classes of $46,44:.,«. > ':. The total reduction in exports of manu factures of all kinds during the same time Is otily J«,162,5.'6. thus showing an Increase in the ex portation of manufactures other than copper and iron and steeL The value of copper exports in the ten months ending with October is 45% per cent below that for the corresponding months of the preceding year, and the value of Iron and Steel ex ports is ni'a per cent low that for the correspond ing months of last year. In the other manufactures, taking the entire ( group except copper and iron and steel, there is. as already indicated, an actual increase. In the case of iron and steel the reduction is partly due to reduced prices per unit of quantity, In part to a re duced demand abroad and in part to forced sales at low rates In certain foreign countries. In cop per the reduction is not due to reduced prices, tho average value a pound of the copper exports of the ten months of this year being the same as thai of the corresponding months of last year. viz.. 16.3 cents a pound. The reduction In copper, there fore, is In quantity, the exportation of bigots, bars and plates tailing from 300.100,141 pounds in the ten months of I:*"" to LG2,72&357 pounds in the corre sponding months of 190 L This falling off in the case of copper la due In part to a reduced demand in the European countrk-B, which wera the chief foreign market for American copper, and In part to an increased production In other countries and reduction of pi ices by foreign producers. The only other Important article showing a material reduc tion Is mineral oil, which is about $3,000,000 less than In the corresponding months of last year, but this decrease is solely due to reduced prices, the num ber of gallons exported In the ten months ending with October being 00.299.023 greater than that for the corresponding months of the preceding year.
