<f lie Ilc&uUioiq* WATERTOWN, WIS. REPOST BY OLNEY. The Secretary of State Adopts an Unusuai Course and Sets a Precedent. Washington, D. C., Dec. 7. —For the first time in memory of old officials the secretary of state has made a regular re port to the President for transmission to Congress like the reports of other officers of the cabinet. This report was laid be fore Congress today as au appendix to the President's message. It treats of many details of our relations during the past year with foreign governments that either were not touched upon at all is the message or were briefly treated. Under the head of Spain Secretary Gl uey has much to say in regard to Cuba and in his report he sets out in great dUail the history of the growth of the re bellion, the present evil state of affairs on the island and other facts upon which the President bases his broad statement and conclusions. No reference is made to a report from Consul-General Lee. but the secretary intimates that his information comes principally from the United States con suls and so must be regarded as confi dential as to its source. The secretary’s estimate of the present situation is disclosed in the following paragraph made after a preliminary statement of the destruction of the in dustrial resources of Cuba: “From whatever point of view we re gard the matter, it is impossible not to discern that a state of things exists at our doors alike dangerous to good rela tions, destructive of the legitimate af fairs of commerce, fatal to the internal resources of Cuba and most vexatious and trying because entailing upon this government excessive burdens in its do mestic administration and in its outward relations. This situation cannot definite ly continue without growing still worse and the time may not be far distant when the United States may seriously consider whether its rights and inter ests as well as its international duties in view of its peculiar relations to the island do not call for some decided change in the policy hitherto pursued.” To begin with the secretary makes it plain that the present insurrection is far more formidable than the famous “ten year insurrection” which began in 

ISGB. He says that, starting in the same por tion of the island, it very early took pro portions beyond its predecessor and therewith assumed an aggressive phase. Passing the defensive lines, or trochas, traversing the island from north to south, formidable bodies of the revolu tionary forces early in the year estab lished themselves in the rich sugar plant ing districts of Santa Clara and Cien fuegos, made hostile forays almost in sight of Havana itself and advancing westward effected a lodgment in the fer tile tobacco fields of Pinar del Rio. which has so far resisted all efforts of the Spanish forces to overcome. The secretary says that while no prom inent seaport has been attacked by the insurgents a large part of the 2200 miles of sea coast is practically in their hands and from its rugged and wild character is peculiarly fitted for guerrilla warfare ynd affords easy means of receiving clan destine supplies of men and arms" The secretary adds: “While thus in fact controlling the large area of the whole island of Cuba from Cape San Antonio to Cape Maisi and enjoying practically unlimited use of an equally large part of the coast the revolutionary forces are scattered, being nowhere united for any length of time to form an army capable of attack or siege and lit to take the defensive in a pitched battle. Assembling suddenly at a given point, often in a single night they make unexpected sallies or carry destruction to the tobacco and cane fields of Cuba and at first sign of pursuit or organized assault they disperse only to reassemble in like manner at some other spot.” As bearing upon the question of recog nition of the insurgents, probably to come before Congress in some shape, the following statement by Secretary Olney is of importance as explaining his rea sons for declining recognition: “So far as our information shows, there is not only no effective local government by the insurgents in the territories they overrun, but there is not even a tangible pretense to establish administration any where. There organization, confined to the shifting exigencies of the military op erations of the hour, is nomadic without definite centers and lacking the most ele mentary features of municipal govern ment. There nowhere appears the nu cleus of statehood. The machinery for exercising the legitimate rights and pow ers of sovereignty and responding to the obligations which de facto sovereignty entitles in the face of equal rights of other states is conspicuously lacking. It is not passible to discern a homo geneous political entitj* possessing and exercising he functions of administration and capable if left to itself of maintain ing orderly government in its own terri tory and sustaining normal relations with the external family of government*.” TO FEEE CuBA. Senator Call Wanted to Doit Before He Went Home to Supper. Washington, D. C., Doc. 7. —Just as the Senate was about to adjourn today Senator Call of Florida arose to offer a resolution, but which he withdrew* until tomorrow. It is a joint resolution as follow’s: Resolved, that the United States of Ameri ca recognizes the republic of Cuba as a free and independent government and accord to that people all the rights of a sovereign and independent government in the ports and within the jurisdiction of the United States. THE RIOTING IN FRANCE. Disturbance at Brest vas Most Disgrace ful. Paris. Dec. 7. —The disturbance at Brest at the fete of St. Barbara, the patroness of the artillerymen, was most disgraceful and continued from 2 o’clock in the morning until midnight. The riot ers invaded the Folies Bergeres concert ball and wrecked the tables and furni ture. From 2 until 10 o’clock in the morning they tried with drawn swords to capture the police office at the town hall, but were kept at bay by the occu pants. who were armed with revolvers. The damage to the property was consid erable. MORE TROOPS FOR CUBA. Smallpox Reduced, the Number on • Transport. Havana, Dec. 7. —The steamer Bazon arrived here today from Spain with re inforcements of 1860 troops. Three of the men died while on the way over and six were suffering from smallpox when the steamer reached this port. The troops were received by a committee of citizens and by the military authorities. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Time Not Ripe for Intervention in Cuban Affairs. Work of the Various Departments Ee views—Tariff and Eevenue. Washington, D. C., Doc. 7. —The fol lowing is the message submitted by Presi dent Cleveland at the opening of Con gress: Washington, D. C., Dec. 7. —To the Con gress of the United States: As represent atives of the people in the legislative branch of their government you have as sembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free institutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A politi cal contest involving momentous conse quences, fraught with feverish apprehen sion and creating aggressiveness so in tense as to approach bitterness and passion has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and in dependent suffrage, without disturbance of our tranquility or the least sign of weak ness in our national structure. When w® consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opinions we dis cover abundant evidence of a determina tion on the part of our countrymen to ab.de by every verdict of the popular will and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus cur people exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitles them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious appre ciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invites. In obedience to a constitutional require ment I herein submit to the Congress cer tain information concerning national af fairs with the suggestion of such legisla tion as in my judgment is necessary and expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tiresome narration I shall omit many details con cerning matters within federal control, which, though by no means unimportant, are more profitably discussed in depart mental icports. I shall also further en - tail this communication by ommitting a minute recital of many minor incidents connected with our foreign re’ations which have heretofore found a place in executive messages but are now contained in a report of the secretary of state, which is here with submitted. • IX 

BLEEDING ARMENIA. Future Safety of American Citizens by Xo Means Assured. At the outset of a reference to the mere important matters affecting our relations with foreign powers it would afford me satisfaction if I could assure Congress that the disturbed condition in Asiatic Turkey | had during the past year assumed a less j hideous and lloody aspect and that either as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish government to the demand of humane civilization, or as the result of de cisive action on the part of the great na tions having the right by treaty to inter fere for the protection of those exposed to the rage of mad bigorty and cruel fan aticism, the shocking features of the situa tion bad been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a soft ened disposition or protective intervention, we have been afflicted by continued and not unfrequent reports of the wanten de struction of homes and the bloody butch eries of men, women and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith. While none of our citizens in Tur key have thus far been killed or wounded, though often in the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety in the future is by no means assured. Our government at home and our minister at Constantinople have left nothing undone to protect our missionaries in Ottoman territory, who constitute nearly all the individuals resid ing there who have a right to claim our protection on the score of American citi zenship. Our efforts in this direction will not be relaxed, but the deep feeling and sympathy that have been aroused among our people ought not to so far blind their reason and judgment as to lead them to demand im possible things. The outbreaks of blind fury which led to murder and pillage in Turkey occur suddenly and without notice and an attempt on our part to force such a hostile presence there as might be ef fective for prevention or protection would not only be resisted by the Ottoman gov ernment but would be regarded as an in terruption of their plans by the great na tions who assert their exclusive right to intervene in their own time and method for the security of life and property in Turkey. Warships Afford Protection. Several naval vessels are stationed in the Mediterranean as a measure of caution and to furnish all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency. We have made claims against the Turkish government for the pillage and destruction of missionary prop erty at Harpoot and Marash during upris ings at those places. Thus far the validity of these demands has not been admitted, though our prior to such outrages and in anticipation' of danger, demanded protection for the persons and property of our missionary citizens in the localities mentioned, and notwithstanding that strong evidence exists of actual complicity of Turkish soldiers in the work of destruc tion and robbery. The Armenian Rcfng-ees. The facts as they now appear do not permit us to doubt the justice of these claims and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt settlement. A number of Armenian refugees having arrived at our ports (an order having late ly been obtained from the Turkish govern ment permitting the wives and children of such refugees to join them here), it is hoped that hereafter no obstacle will be interposed to prevent the escape of all those who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in Turkish dominions. Our recently apponted consul to Erze roura is at his post and is discharging the duties of his office, though for some unac countable reason his formal exequateur from the sultan has not been Issued. I do not believe that the present sombre prospect in Turkey will be long permitted to offend the sight of Christendom. It seems hardly possible that the earnest de mand of good people throughout the Chris tian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered. THE 

CUBAN QUESTION. The President Practically Offers a Protectorate. The insurrection in Cuba still continues with all its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made toward the pacification of the island or that the situati n of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the sea ports and all the con siderable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the inland country. If the o r . nation of Spain to put down the Insur eccion eems but to strengthen with time an i. evinced by her unhesitating devotion of largely in creased military and naval force:- to the task, there la much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers and character and resources, and are none the less inflexible in their re solve not to succumb without practically securing the great objects for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re established her authority, neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent state. In deed, as the contest has gone on, the pretense that civil government exists on the island, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it, has been practically aban doned. Spain does keep on foot such a government, more or less imperfectly, in the large towns and their immediate sub urbs, but, that exception being made, the entire country is either given over to anarchy or is subject to the military occu pation of one or the other, party. It is reported, indeed, on reliable authority, that, at the demand of the commander-in chief of the insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now given up all attempt to exercise its functions, leaving that government confessedly (what there is the best reason for supposing it al ways to have been in fact) a government merely on paper. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists in the open, or in pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for, and the im mense superiority of Spanish forces in numbers, discipline and equipment could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advant age, but they are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements; that can choose and does choose its own ground; that from the nature of the country is visible or invisible at pleasure, and that fights only from ambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on its side. No Telling W hen It Will End. In a country where all that is indispen sable to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtainable, espe cially by those born and bred on the soil, it is obvious that there is hardly a limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as in ail cases cf protracted civil strife, the pas sions of the combatants grow more and more inflamed and excesses on both sides become more frequent and more deplor able. They are also participated in by bands of marauders who now in the name of one party and now in the name of the other, as may best suit the occa sion, harrass the country at will and plunder its wretched inhabitants for their own advantage. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail immense destruc tion of property, even if it were the policy of both parties to prevent it as far as practicable. But while such seemed to be the original policy of the Spanish govern ment, it has now apparently abandoned it and is acting upon the same theory as the insurgents; namely, that the exigencies of the contest require the wholesale annihila tion of property that it may not prove cf use and advantage to the enemy. It is to the same end that, in pursuance of general orders, Spanish garrisons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural population required to concen trate itself in the towns. The sure result would seem to be that the industrial value of the island is fast diminishing, and that unless there is a speedy and radical change in existing conditions, it will soon disap pear altogether. That value consists very largely, cf course, in its capacity to pro duce sugar, a capacity already much re duced by the interruptions to the tillage which have taken place during the last two years. It is reliably asserted that should these interruptions continue during the current year and practically extend, as is now threatened, to the entire sugar prooducing territory cf the island, so much time and so much money will be required to restore the land to its normal pro ductiveness that it is extremely doubtful if capital can be induced to even make the attempt. How It Affects the United Slates. The spectacle of utter ruin of an ad joining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming cn the globe, would engage the serious attention of gov ernment and the people of the United States in any circumstances. In point ; of fact, they have a concern with it which is by no means of a wholly sentimental I or philanthropic character. It lies so near i to us as to be hardly separated from our | territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in it is second only to that of the people and government of Spain It is reasona bly estimated that at least from $30,000,- 000 to $50,000,000 of American capital is in vested in plantations and In railroad, min ing and other business enterprises on the island. The volume of trade between the United States and uCba, which in 1889 amounted to about $64,000,000, rose in 1893 to about $103,000,000 and in 1894 (the year before the present insurrection broke out) amounted nearly $96,000,000. Besides this large pecuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself in extricably involved in the present contest in ether ways both > c'*atious and costly. Many Cubans reside in this country and indirectly promote the insurrection through the press, by public meetings, by the purchase and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds and by other means, which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the subject of criminal Seme of them, though Cubans at heart and in all their feelings and interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citi zens of the United States, a proceeding re sorted to with a view to possible protec tion by this government and not unnat urally regarded with much indignation by the country of their origin. The insur gent are undoubtedly encouraged and supported by the widespreaA sympathy the people of this country always and in stinctively feel fer every struggle for bet ter and freer government and which in the case of the more adventurous and restless elements of our people leads in only too many instances, to active par ticipation in the contest. The result is that this government is constantly called upon to protect American citizens, to claim damages for injuries to persons and property now estimated at many millions cf dollars and to ask explanations and apologies for the acts of Spanish officials, whose zeal for the repression of rebellion sometimes blinds them to the immunities belonging to the unoffending citizens of a friendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United States is compelled to actively police along its line of sea coaist against unlawful expeditions, the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not always suffice to prevent. These inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the large American property interests af fected, and considerations of philanthropy and humanity in general, have led to a vehement demand in various quarters for some sort of positive intervention on the part of the United States. Intervention Is Impracticable. It wae at first proposed that beligerent rights should be accorded to the insur gents —a proposition no longer urged be cause untimely and in practical operation clearly perilous and injurious to our own interests. It has since been and is now sometime* contended that the independ ence of the insurgents should be recog nized. But imperfect and restricted as the Spanish government of the island may be, no other exists there —unless the will of the military officer in temporary com mand of a particular district can be digni fied as a species cf government. It is now also suggested that the United States should buy the island —a suggestion possi bly worthy of consideration if there were any evidence of a desire cr willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a pro posal. It is urged finally, that, all other nethods failing, the existing internecine strife in Cuba should be terminated by ur intervention, even at the ccet of a war between the United States and Spain— a war which its advocates confidently prophesy could be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful in its issue. The correctness of this forecast need bo neither affirmed nor denied. The United States has, nevertheless, a character to maintain as a nation which plainly dic tates that right and not might should be the rule of its conduct. Further, though the United States is not a nation to which peace is a necessity, it is in truth the most pacific of powers and desires nothing so much as to live in amity with all the world. Its own ample and diversified do mains satisfy all possible longings for ter ritory, preclude all dreams of conquest and prevent any casting of covetous eyes upon neighboring regions, however, at tractive. That our conduct towards Spain and her dominions constituted no exception to the national disposition is made mani fest by the course of our government, not only thus far during the present insurrec tion, but during the ten yeans that followed the uprising at Yara in 1868. Wc Otto a. Debt to Spain. No other great power, it may safely be said, under circumstances of similar per plexity, would have manifested the same restraint and tho same patient endurance. It may also be said that this persistent attitude of the United States towards Spain in connection with Cuba unquestion ably evinces no slight respect and regard for Spain on the part of the American peo ple. They in truth do not forget her connection with the discovery of the West ern hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the great qualities of the Spanish people, nor fail to fully recognize their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to the national honor. They view with wonder and admiration the cheerfulness and resolution with which vast bodies of men are sent across thousands of miles of ocean and an enormous debt accumulated that the costly possession of the “Gem of the Antilles’’ may still hold its place in the Spanish crown. And if neither the government nor the people of the United States have shut their eyes to the course of events in Cuba or have failed, to realize the existence of conceded grievances which have led to the present revolt from the authority of Spain, grievances recognized by the queen regent and by the cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and enlight ened of Spanish statesmen without regard to party and demonstrated by reforms pro posed by the executive and approved by the legislative branch of the Spanish gov ernment, it is in the assumed temper and disposition of the Spanish government to remedy these grievances, fortified by indi cations of influential public opinion in Spain that this government has hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of composing the present strife with honor and advantage to Spain and with the achievement of all the reasonable objects of the insurrection, it would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy—a measure of home rule, which, while the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects—there should be no just reason why the pacification of the island might not be effected on that basis. Autonomy the True Policy. Such a result would appear to be in the true interest of all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which is now consuming the resources of the island and making it worthless for whichever party may ultimately prevail. It would keep intact the possessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will be con sulted rather than impugned by the ade quate redress of admitted grievances. It would put on a firm basis the prosperity of the Island and the fortunes of its in habitants within their own control, with out severing the natural and ancient ties which bind them to the mother county, and would yet enable them to test their capacity for self-government under the most favorable conditions. It has been objected on the one side that Spain should not promise outonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their arms; on the other side, that promised autonomy, however liberal, would be in sufficient because without assurance of the promise being fulfilled. Eut the reasonableness of a requirement by Spain of unconditional surrender on the part of the insurgent Cubans before their autonomy is conceded is not alto gether apparent. It ignores important features of the situation —the stability of two years duration has given to the in surrection the feasibility of its indefinite prolongation in the nature cf things, and, as shown by past experiences the utter and imminent ruin of the island unless the present strife is speedily composed, and above all, the rank abuse-s which all par ties in Spain, all branches in her govern ments and all her leading public men con cede to exist and profess a desire to re move. Facing such circumstances, to withhold tho proffer of needed reforms until the parties demanding them put themselves at mercy by throwing down their arms has the appearance of neglecting the gravest perils and inviting suspicion as to the sincerity of any professed willingness to grant reforms. The objection on behalf of the insurgents (that promised reforms can not be relied upen) must of course be con sidered, though we have no right to as sume and no reason for assuming that anything Spain undertakes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done according to both the spirit and the letter of the un dertaking. Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions and precautions on the part of the weaker of two combatants are always natural and not always unjustifiable (the United States being sincerely desirous in the interest of both as well as on its own account that the Cuban problem should be solved with the least possible delay), it was intimated by this government to the government of Spain some months ago that, if a satis factory measure of home rule were ten dered the Cuban insurgents and would be accepted by them upon a guaranty of its execution, the United States would en deavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain for furnishing such guaranty. While no definite response to this inti mation has yet been received from the Spanish government it is believed to be not altogether unwelcome, while as already suggested, no reason is perceived why it should not be approved by the insurgents. Neither party can fail to see the im portance of early action and both must realize that to prolong the present state of things for even a short period will add enoromusly to the time and labor and ex penditure necessary to bring about the in dustrial recuperation of the island. It is therefore fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for healing the breach between Spain and the insurgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated may be at once inaugurated and pushed to an imme diate and successful issue. The friendly offices of the United States either in the manner above outlined or in any other way consistent with our constitution and laws will always be at the disposal of either party. Monroe Doctrine Rc-Afflrmed. Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interests would constrain us to object to the acquisition of the island or any interference with its control by any other power. It should be added that it can not be reasonably assumed that the hither to expectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to accord all due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view tho pending conflict in all its features and properly apprehend our inevitably close relations to it and its passible results without considering that by the course of events we may be drawn into such an un usual and unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and in her own way, or with, our friendly coopera tion. When the inability of Spain to deal suc cessfully with the insurrection has become manifest and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is extinct in Cuba for all pur poses of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for its reestablishment has degenerated into a strife which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human li:’e and the utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will bo superseded by higher obligations, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. Deferring the choice of ways and meth ods until the time for action arrives, we should make them depend upon the precise conditions then existing, and they should not be determined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration involv ing our honor and interest, or the inter national duty we owe to Spain. The Situation Is Not Ripe. Until we face the contingencies suggest ed, or the situation is by other Incidents imperatively changed, we should continue in tho lino of conduct heretofore pursued, thus in all circumstances exhibiting our obedience to the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty enjoined upon us by the position we occupy in the family of nations. A contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation either through a careless disre gard of present duty or even an undue stimulation and ill-timed expression of feeling. But I have deemed it not amiss to remind the congress tnat a time may arrive when a correct policy and care for our interests, as well as a regard for the interests of other nations and their citi zens, joined by considerations of humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile coun try, intimately related to us, saved from complete devastation will constrain our government to such action as will subserve the interests thus involved and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an opportunity to enjoy the blessings of peace.
