John Woslev. the founder of Methodical, was born in KnjjhunJ in the year of 1703, nd was ed ucated at Oxford University. He was couvnrted in K2l. His lirst efforts at relonnatioa were made in the vicinity of Oxford, England. In 17.15, Julia Wesley, with his brother Charles, visited Georgiii to preach to tho Colonists; but they were not very successful in gaining c inverts to their new system of theology. They returned to Eng land and resumed their reform it ry labors in 1739 with great success. He died in .1791 at the ago of 88 years. He always claimed to be u member of the ProteslantUpiseoli al Church the established church of England and he and his apos tates, in a spirit of burlesque, were called Ranters." 1 The following incident is told of Wesley : There was a famous man in that day, a prominent person in the ranks "of elegance and fashion, named "Ueau Xash," who, liko nil other dandies, was a hopeless fool. He happened to be present when Vsley preached at Both, and go. nig up to mm lieiore the sermon, lie asked li'nn, "liy what authority he undertook to preachy" Wes ley replied, "Uy that Jesus Christ, conveyed to me by the Archbishop of Canterbury, when he laid hands on mo and said, 'Take thou aiiduci ty to preach the gospel."', Nash replied that "ho was acting contra ry to tho laws of the Church." 'I'idyon ever hear mo preach T' said Wesley. "No, sir,'.1 replied Nash, "1 judge of you by common report." "Well, sir," answered Wesley, "I should be more charit able than to form my opinion of you by common report." Tho (list Methodist congrega tion in the United States was form ed in New York City by a few Irish emigrants in 1700. The first Meth odist meeting house built in the United Slates was erected on John Street, New York City, in 1708. It, was 00 bv 42 feet; and tho first sermon preached in it was In Octo ber of that year, by Mr. Embury Iwul preacher, who had formerly pi eai'lied for the Methodist in bis own house. Previous to the Hcv pluli inaiy war the preachers in this country were merely lnj preachers. there bcinir no authority in this country in the M. R. Chinch to or (lain Ministers. This difficulty was finally settled in 1784, The Rev. Thomas Coke of the ChuHi of England was consecrated Superin tendent,' and Richard Whatcoat and Thorn : Vasey were ordained El ders and sent to the United Btates to carry on the work, which they did uioi-l successfully. Their first general Conference was held in 1702. At that time there wero In the United Slaloo 2fifl regular MetU odi.ii preachers and 05,000 mem bers. Now, the Methodists have more than 6,000 regular and travel-, ii'g. good local preachers, and 1,000,000 members, of whom 200, C't 0 arc colored. and eiglitcen-humlrfd (dollar bull tcrricr "pups !

The sixteenth corps, under General Dalkcr, and the fifteenth corps, under General liijon, fought with grand courage.
