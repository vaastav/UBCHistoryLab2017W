R. L. Gould, of the City and Suburban Homes Company, at the dinner of the Reform Club, held at the clubhouse. No. 233 Fifth-aye.. in a speech raid That a little over a year ago Mr. Carnegie, after investigating: the schema cf the company, had subscribed $100,000. jjr. Gould said: jjr. Carnegie is not interested In founding libraries only. A lit Tie more than a year ago I to Mr. Cameg'.e and told him what we were Aoing. The next day I received a letter from MM asking two or three questions. I re plied to these, and the next morning received a subscription of $100,000. The dinner was held under the auspices of the Committee on City Affairs of the Reform Club- The general subject was "Municipal Bet termer.: frvm the Constructive. Artistic and Financial Points of View." the aim being to E uggefT how the city could be improved in every direction, ■".hat public works the new adminis- tration should undertake, and the bept way to ■ meet the expenses without exceeding the debt limit or greatiy increasing the taxes. The speak ers were Controller Coler. ex-Congressman W. J. Coombs. Brooks Adams. Robert W. de For est, th" Tenement House Commissioner, desig r.an-. and Dr. E. K. L. Gould. John G. Agar chairman. Controller Cc.ler. who was the first speaker. talked on "Wtoere to Get xhf afoney." He said ir. part : I believe, the clause in th« constitution limiting the indebtedness of the city— wholly admirable at he time it was written-is not altogether adapted to modem requirements in that it does not discrim inate sufficiently between two classes of city debts o* a. wholly different character. "in one of these classes are improvements, which while adding to the attractiveness, beaut;.- and aealthfulness of a city, to its economical admin. tration, or to the better conduct of its govern mental function, bring in no direct financial re turns. There is another class of improvements far les= commonly met with, which either result in casting no burdens whatever upon the taxpayers or else bring in an actual profit to the municipality. In such cases it may be permissible to ask wherein there lies any rational excuse for limiting the gov ernmental activities of a. city by constitutional restrictions. . . Brooks Adams, in a. speech that* aroused con siderable Interest, argued that art in the con struction of a city, was the most valuable asset a city could have. He continued: I venture to assert that no investment ever yielded such a '.arge return through so long a period, as that made by Pericles on the Acropolis. To-day those ruins are the best asset Greece owns. Phoenicia presented an exactly opposite phenom enon Phoenicia knew not how to spend, usually Ebe economized on her architecture, and few have ever cared to visit her mean and Ignoble temples. but sometimes she sought to be magnificent, ana then she became wasteful and vulgar. She sheathed the Temple of the Sun at Carthage with cold plates worth Si.-OO.COO. and accomplished only its destruction. V\'e are somewhat in the position of Phoenicia. In conclusion he said: New-York owes the whole country a high duty. It is her duty to teach us how to stop Mr De Forest who followed, said that prog re" in the work of his department was most likely to come along the line of intelligent, kind, educational, firm inspection of the tenement houses. He showed that there had been little inspection in years past. ;_. __;'«/_.' V*. v,* Dr Gould who spoke last, said that he thought ■'he thing 'which would tell most for the im provement, because it is fundamental, is giving the decent plain people of a great city an op portunity to live decently." I__~*_: There were about one hundred and twenty persons present, among whom were W. H. Peckham John De Witt Warner, Seth Sprapue Terry Louis Wlndmuller. Charles S. Fairchild, Henry De Forest Baldwin and Lawrence E. Sexton. BE ATT LTQITDATIOX IX STOCKS. call money dp to 12 per cent-the mar ket closes WEAK.

GARDEN CITY CLUB DECLARES CHARGES AGAINST TRAVIS ARE FALSE— AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT. With a view to putting an end to the charges re garding Travis's connection with the Garden City Golf Club, the board of governors of that organiza tion has issued a statement declaring that the amateur champion enjoys his membership precisely on the same grounds with every other member of the club. It is the first official notice that the Garden City club has taken of the matter, and. according to ex-Justice Horace Russell, the presi dent, its purpos« is to place the club on record in defence of Mr. Trax'is rather than to indicate that the charges -were* considered worthy of such action. "I think." said Judge Russell in referring to th« THE SPEAKERS' TABLE AT THE REFORM CLUB DINNER. matter yesterday, "that the standing of the men composing the board ought to be enough to put an end to these silly rumor?. You need not ca'.l it an investigation. That wasn't necessary. We know that Mr. Travis s connection with the club is en tirely regular, and that he receives no exemptions of any kind." At the me»: T !ne in Judge Russell's office in tvhirh the minutes were adopted, there were present, be sides the president. George L. Hui-beU. secretary: William M. Baldwin, treasurer; Thornis I-. Man son, jr., Bruce Price. Devereux Emmet. George F. Crane and Willard F. Ward. The resolutions, ■which were unanimously made a part of the mm L,-es. were as follows. This being the first meeting of the board of gov ernors since the early spring, and the attention of the board being called to the charge made by Caspar Whitney, to the effect that the connection of Walter J. Travis with the Garden City Golf Club was "discreditable," and the attention of tn>j board further being called to the correspondence between Mr. Travis and Mr. Lawrence, in which it appears that a rumor has been circulated to tn<J effect that Mr. Travis is or has been exempted by the Garden City club from dues and obligations imposed upon other members, and, this rumor be ing presumably the foundation of Caspar v\ nlt nev's charge, the board unanimously resolve ana record that" there is no foundation whatever for the charge of Caspar Whitney that the connection of Mr Travis with the Garden City Golf Club is dis creditable but the same is false and baseless; and the rumor that Mr. Travis is. or has been, exempt ed from any dues, charges or obligations is entirely *M r Travis became a member of th<* club ape** the payment of an initiation fee and dues, like every one else, and has always paid all charges on exactly the same footing as every other member of the club. Th€re has never been a suggestion by him. or any m«b^ that he should be treated differently. "The story undoubtedly had Its origin." said Judge Russell, "in the resignation of Mr. Travis from the Oakland Golf Club. Naturally, the club regretted the loss of such a prominent member. and it is easy to understand how some of the Oak land players may have attributed it to a more fa vorable membership at Garden City. As a matter of fact Mr Travis is not a man to ask or expect membership in a club on any different terms from _tn« members. Garden City is a better course than O™k{_nd and Mr Travis liked it well, enough to join the club. That is all there isto Jit. An effort was made to see Mr. Travis, but he had left town for the day. __- —• fiPORTZ OX THE ICE.

Princeton and Pennsyl vania The chances are that Harvard and Cornell Wfil not be met on the gridiron, as the Columbia authorities are coming to the wise conclusion that the three big games are all that the eleven can successfully undertake. The Harvard game comes too early in the year for the Mprningside team to b» in fit condition This, combined with the fact that Harvard is unwilling to come to New-York, makes it probable that the Crimson will not be played next year, especially as it is believed now that the team can make as much money with only three big games as with the five they have had hitherto It is not likely that the Cornell game could be satisfactorily arranged at a time which would give a proper interval between the other .tames It is also likely that next year the fall practice at Branford. Conn., will be abandoned as ft has been conclusively proved in the last two years that the work there was valueless, because of the insufficient number of candidates to take part in Jt. MEDICALS SCORE OVER LAWYERS. HELPED BY HARE. HOWEVER. THE LATTER PLAYED A FINE GAME. [BT TELEGRAFH TO THE TRIBfXE.] Philadelphia.

The Medical 6 had the services of Teas and Butler, of the 'varsity team, and Roller and Merriam. who played professional ball vith the Philadelphias this season. They were oppot-.-d by tne mighty Hare and by the- fresh man law eleven. Hare put up a wonderful game, tackling like a fiend all ovt-r the field, running well vitb the ball and kicking a gna! from the field. Th< Hrst half wu all in favor of th* Medicals, who scored, but the lawyers braced in the second hsif ■: the bail within the 30-yard line and Hare kicked a goal. They tore up the medical line again, nnd would have scored had not time been called, leaving the medicals victors by 6 points to 5. BASEBALL. DEADLOCK OVER NATIONAL LEAGUE PRESIDENCY-BRUSH'S SCHEME PROBABLY DOOMED TO DEFEAT. In an absolute deadlock over the selection of a president to succeed N. E. Young, the "magnates" of the National League argued the time away at the Fifth Avenue Hotel yesterday. As announced by President Young, at the conclusion of the day session, no baseball history was made is the. out come of the war of words. As a matter of fact. It is doubtful if any progress will be made, for sev eral days. Although practically voted down at Wednesday's session. John T. Brush will not. relinquish his pet scheme of reorganization. Defeated temporarily. Brush and his followers have sought retaliation in blocking the election of A. G. Spalding as presi dent of the league. It is safe to say. however, that in time the Brush forces will be compelled to give in and Mr. Spalding will be elected. This will not be exactly pleasing to Freedman. the New-York baseball hoodoo. Two sessions, each of several hours' duration. were held yesterday by th« "magnates." The first was called at 3 o'clock arid lasted until 6. The evening session began at S o'clock and was not completed until nearly midnight "Merely a, remi niscence meeting," was the way one of the len^ue directors referred to ih- three hour debate that took place during the afternoon, and at which jonn T. Brush took occasion to ver.t his spite on th« newspapers by declaring that they were i trying to •wreck the national game. Ostensibly the mag nates" spent the day discussing the report ol board of directors and listening to "one for all and all for or.'-" speeches by Jo] T. Bra That th<* session was decidedly acrimonious la an open secret. Pro and con th* "magnates" argued th« question of syndicate baseball. Solidly opposed to any measure that would make the great -American game smack of the trust wf-rr- the Brooklyn. Phila delphia, Mttsburg and Chicago represmtatlves. Behind Brush were arrayed the men from j..ost<>n. New-York and St. Louis. While Brush Is figuring prominently in th.* right. it will be, Freedman who will bo the leap™*: leader if Brush's scntme goes through. The New-YorK hoodoo will be the real power behind the vhrone. The chances however, of th* Brush combination securing a victory are very small, and it i* believed that some kind of a compromise is all that Brush can expect. , , Freedman has demanded that the leajnie m.ik<» pood his $15.'>»> guarantee for carrying Manhattan Field. By this It Will bo seen that Manhattan Field did not make any money this last seiso:-. Two years ago Friedman forced the magnates to pay the rental of Manhattan Field, on th. ground that if it was not carried along by the New-York club some rival organization might slip in and pet the grounds. Last year a deficit of $2,100 only was reported to the league for settlement. This year it. is probable that Freedman had the football games played on the Polo Grounds. r< Ited the rent directly to the New-"! club and then de mand. d that the league make good the entire de flclencv. "It looks -i- If we were being fllmflnT.med some what." said one maKnate yesterday, "but the best we can _o is to settle " "Ki<i" Nichols, the Boston pitcher, arrived in New-York yesterday with President Whitfleld of the Western League. He had a long consultation with A. H. Soden. of Boston, last night The "Kid" h;is an offer of a half Interest In the Kansas City team with "Jimmy" Manning:. The provision Is. however, that he must, play and manage the tram. Nichols's visit here is for the purpose of -urine: his release from Boston. He wants to part with the Bo?ton people on friendly terms Mr Soden promised to give Nichols a di finite answer to-day.

A THLETES DISCIPUXED. MANY PENALTIES INFLICTED RV THE A. A. r. REGISTRATION rnMMITTEK. The registration committee nf thf Metropolitan Association of the Amateur Athletic Union held a meeting at the Astor House last night and de cided several important cases. It was brought to the attention of the committee by a member of the basketball committee that a team claiming to rep resent the Holyoke High School, which won the Interscholastlc basketball championship at the Pan-American Exposition, had been protested. After discussion it was resolved that in view of the fact that the entry blank of the Holyoke High School team mentions the names of th»- players. and Inasmuch as the committee his a letter from the principal of the Holyoke HiKh School statins that this team was not eligible to represent that Institution, the players on said tenm should be suspended and the banner and prizes which were awarded to them must be returned. It was also resolved that, in view of the fact that the Pastime Athletic Club basketball team had played a professional in the championships last April, they be required to relinquish second posi tion, which they secured in that competition. It was decided that this disqualification should not affect the standing of the other teams, and that all games won and lost stand as if the Pastime Ath letic Club team had not been disqualified. The 17i h Separate Company team gets the championship. . The committee disqualified and suspended the fol lowing for competing in the firemen's games at Buffalo on August 23. 19M: William Coleman. .John Coleman. jr., William Whittaker.

The worst accident since the six day bicycle race began occurred yesterday afternoon. Fisher having his collarbone broken and Chevallfer receiving a spra.lned wrist and other Injuries. The crash -was caused by a collision between McLean and Che vallier. Fisher's partner. The latter was doing some sprinting at the time, and McLean in some unknown manner collided with him. Both men fell, and Chevallier had to leave the track. An instant later Fisher mounted his wheel and was riding at full speed around the track, when Fredericks, who peemed weak and was wob bling a bit, struck the rear wheel of Fisher's bi cycle. Both rider? were thrown to the track. Hall, who was also making strenuous efforts to keep up with the other riders, ran mto the fallen men. and was also thrown from his wheel, but escaped injury. Fisher lay senseless for several minutes, and had to b<> assisted to his dressing room by his trainers. He was later removed to the home of a friend. Earlier in the day ChevalMei and Fisher had gained a lap on tho other t^ams. which put them even with the leaders. Fisher came out to relieve his partner at the time, and when Che vallier saw him he made a spurt, and when he had gained half a lap Fisher started in and gained the other half lap. . y, „„ The greatest excitement since the race began was caused in the afternoon, when Baboock and Turville the repre.-^nnitive? of the i.enturv Koaa Club Association, rained a lap, which put them up with the leaders. Babcock, setting the pace, gained a quarter of a lap. when TurviUe took up the work an.l gained the rest of the lao. More excite ment was aroused when McEachern and Waithour. the Pan-American team started to sprint soon after 1 o'clock in the afternoon. The men relu-vo.l each other every few iaps. Walthour at last gained the desired lap", but the judges failed to credit the team with it and the manager of the team said he would take the team off. At ri o'clock MrEachern, dressed in street clothes appeared on the track and an nounced that he would not ride any more unless the lap was restored. Walthour. who was riding at the time shouted to him: "Don't quit, Archie: for God's sakf don't desert me!" After three-quarters of an hour of argument with the iudges. McEachern returned to thf race, but asserted he would ride only long enough to give the judges time to reconsider their decision. Wisher and Chevalller ar«> out of the race for good, it appears. „ Several of the men in the race show the effects of thp strain, an.l It is probable that stimulant 3 are being used to keep them on the track. There was a big crowd to see the contest last evening, and the short races aroused much enthusiasm. Th- nne mile match race, best two in three heats, was won by How:, rd Freeman, who defeated George Schrelber. In the five mile pursuit race Jean Gougoltz defeated Owen Kimble. The best sprinting of the race took place between 10 and U o'clock last night. Tne spurt was started about 11:20 o'clock by Ball. He made a dash and gained half a lap In three rounds of the track, with Kinc on his rear wheel. McEachern a-as relieving Walthour. liut hf fell back, and W*althour. who stood watching 'ho sprint, immediately r^nounu-d an.l started ta pursuit Around and aruiirnl went the leaders at a twenty-two mile an hour pace, lap ping the low. r men time after time. Jaak lost four laps. King, who had game.! a Lao with Hall, was relieved by his p.^rtn^r. Pamuelson. who could not follow the pace and lost a lap. Lawson lost four laps !n thf sprint. Walthour rod<» like the wind and led the hunch every lap. The crowd kf>pt cheering till midnicht. The record at 1 o'clock this morning was as fol lows: Miles. Laps. McEachern and W.-ilthour 1.512 1 Butl«-r and McLean 1.812 1 »wklrk and Munro 1.812 1 Maya and Wilson 1.812 1 Babcock and Turville 1.812 1 King and Samuelaon - 1.811 » I^awson and Julius 1.811 2 Hall and McLaren 1.811 5 Fredericks and Jaak 1.811 8 Considerable comment was heard among the spectators In the day regarding the slow time bein^ made by the riders. As the race advances toward the end the a ore shows the riders to be steadily runninK behind the record. At 1 o'clock this morn inc: the leaders were nearly seventy miles behind the record.
