The President's Message. Third Session or the Thirty-seventh Con gress, Ueceaaber 1st, 1869. FtUow Citizen of tha Senate and Bouse of Rep resentatives : , Since your last assembling another year of health and bountiful harvest has passed, and while it has not pleased the Alraighty to bless us with a return of peace, tee can not but press on, guided by the best light be gives us, trusting that in his own good time and rise way, all will be well. CCK rORElGS 

RELATION'S. Tha correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted, in com pliance with a request te that effect. If the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than formerly, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation ao unhappily distracted might hare rea sonably apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of our do mestic difficulties, so unwisely and so un auceerafully as we think, recognized the insurgents as a belligerent power, would eon recede from that position which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country, but the tempo rary reverses which afterwards befel the national arms, and which were exajrerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice. The civil war which has so radically changed for the moment the occupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily in creasing throughout a period ot bait a century. It has at the same time excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we hare for borne taking part in any contreversy be tween parties and factions in any such States. We have attempted no propagand iim and acknowledged no revolution, but we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs. Our struggle has been of course contem- I slated by foreign nations with reference era to its own merits tkan to its supposed and often exaggerated effects and the consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint en the part ef this government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise. SCPPRF.SSIOX OF THE SLAVE TKADE. The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of especial pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of Her Majesty's government has been marked with a jeal ous respect for the authorities of the United States, and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens. The convention with Hanover for the abolition of the State dues has been car ried into full effect under the act of Con gress for that purpose. THE COAST BLOCKADE. A blockade of 3.000 miles of sea coast could noibe established and vigorously en forced, in a season of great commercial activity like the present, without commit ting occasional mistakes, and 3i:tlicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects. A civil war, occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on a trade under treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violations of neutral rights. All such col lisions tend to excite misapprehensions and possibly to produce national reclama tions between nations which have a com mon iuterest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds, I hare, so for as possible, heard and redressed complaints by friendly powers. There is, however, a large and augmenting numder of doubtful cases, upon which tne government is un able to agree with the governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United Mates or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authori ties of foreign nations, which the govern ments of these States are not at once pre pared to redress. A3! IXTERSATIP5AZ. COXTSXTIOX. I have proposed to some of the for eign States interested mutual conven tions to examine and adjust some com plaints. This has been made especially to Great Britain, France, Spain, and Prusia. la each case it has been kindly received, but not yet formally adopted. THE CASE OF A VORWEGIAa BARE. I deem it my duty to recommend an appropropriation in behalf of the owners of the Norwegian bark Admiral P. For oieas Riola, which vessel was, in May, 1861, prevented by the commander of tbe blok adiag force of Charleston, from leaving that port with a cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted te an English vessel. I have di rected the Secretary of State to cause tbe papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committee. AFRICAN EMIGRATION". Applications have been made to mo by many free ATerieae df Africa descent to favor their emigration, with a view to 6uch colonization as was contemplated in receat acts of Congress. Other parties at home and abroad, some from interested and other motives, have sugjested similar measures; whi!, on the other hand, seve ral of the Spanish American Republic have f rotested against the sending of such colonies to fceir respective territories. Under these circumstances I have declin ed to move any such colony to any State without first obtaining the consent of its poeernment, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all their rights as freemen ; and 1 have, at the same time, offered teihe several States situated in the tropics or having colonies there to negotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor tbe voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just, and humane. Liberia and Hayti are yet the only countries to which coloists of African descent from here could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citizens, and I regret to say that such per sons contemplating colonization do not seem willing to emigrate to these countries as to some others, as I think their inter ests demand. I believe, however, that the opinion is improving, and that ere long there will bean augumented and consid erable emigration to these countries from the United States. OCR FOREIGN" RELATIONS. The new commercial treaty between tbe United States nd the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution. A com mercial and consular treaty has been ne gotiated, subject to the Senate's convent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending with the Re. ublic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the na tional commerce is expected to result from these measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Ru5tia, Prussia, Penmirk, Sweden and Austiia, ! tbe Netherlands, Italy, Home, and the other Europeon States, remain undistur-' bed. 'Very favorable relations also con tinue to be maintained with Turkey, Mo rocco, China and Japan. XKB KEIGBaORIKG XATIOXS. louring the last year there has not oniy been ne -change of our previous relations with the Independent KtaLes of our con tinent, but more Jnienaly sentiments than have been heretofore existing are believed -to.be entertained by those neighbors whose safety And progress are o intimately con nected ith our own. This statement pUiif .applies to Mexico, -Costa Rica, Nicaragua, iionduras, Peru, and Chili. TheeomsAusaion, under the convention with ihe Republic of New Granada, closed its 4w4on without having audited and passed uynn all tbe claims which were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive ih ooave&Lcn, that msy be able to do more complete justice. The commission between the United States and the Re public of Costarica baa completed its labors and submitted its report 1KTERXATIOXAL TELEGRAPH. I have favored the project of connecting the UtiiUd. States with Europe by an At lantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from San Francisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph wire with the wire that is being extended across the Russian empire. OCR TERRITORIES. The Territories of the United Slates, with unimportant exceptions, have re" mafoed undisturbed by this civil war, and they .v exhibiting such evidence of pros perity us justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition .to.be organized as States, and be constitutionally admitted into tbe Federal Union. The immense mineral resources of 6ome of these Territories ought to be developed a rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to im prove the revenues of the government and diminish the burdens of the people. A SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION. It is worthy of your serious considera tion whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted. The measure which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific explora tion of tbe mineral regions in those Ter ritories, with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries results which cannot fail to be auspi cious. NATIONAL FIXAXCES The condition of the national finances will claim your most diligent consideration The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the nunnresaion of the rebellion have A l t hitherto met with a promptitude and cer tainty unusual in similar circumstances, aatl the public credit has been fully maintained. THE CURRENCY INFLATION. The continuance of the war, how ever, and the increased disbursements made necessary, demand your best reflec tions as to tbe best modes of providing the necessary revenue. J he suspension of specie payments by the banks made lame issues of the United States notes uo avoidable. In no other way could tbe payment of tbe troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or as well provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress securing tbe re- ceivability of these notes for loans and internal duties, and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them -universal currency, and has satisfied, par tially at least and for the time, the long felt want of a uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to tbe people immense sums in discount and exchange. A return to s(ecie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible, with a due regard to all interests, should be kept in view. EVILS OF FLUCTUATION. Fluctuations-in the value of currency are always injurious, and to redress these fluctuations to the flowest possible point, will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation. - Prompt and certain convertibility into coin is generally ac knowledged to be the best and sur est against them, and it is extremely dou'oti'ul whether a circulation of United States notes, payable in coin and suffi ciently large for the wants of the people, can be permanently useful and 'safely maintained. Is there any other mode in which the necessary provision for tbepublic wants can be made, & the great advantages fa safe and uniform currency secured? A REMEDY PROPOSED. I kno of none which promises so certain results, and at the same time so unobjectionable, as the organization of banking associations under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such associations tho government might furui.-h circulating notes on the se curity of Unitod Plates bonds deposited in the treasury. The?e notes, prepared under the supervision of proper oflicers, being uniform in appearance and security, and convertible always into coin would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges. A mode rate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and distribution ot the rates and a general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt t-na ployed as security. The public credit, moreover, would bn greatly improved, and the nego tiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for govern ment bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is an additional recommendation of the mea sure, of considerable weight in my judg ment, that it would reconcile, as lar as possible, all existing iuteresss by the op portunity ottered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act substituting only the secured uniform national circu lation for the local and various circula tions now issued by tbem. THE TREASURY EXHIBIT. The receipts into the Treasury from all bureaus, including loans and balauces from the preceding year, for tbe fiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1862, were: RECEIPTS.

Other information on the subject of the finances will be given in the repoit of the Jecretary ct the treasury, to whose state mentsand views 1 invite your most candid and considerate attention. WAR AND XAVT BSrORTS. The reports of the Secretary of the Navy and W ar are herewith transmitted These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more oriel extracts 01 tbe very numerous and extensive transactions and operations conducted through these departments. nor could I give a summary of them heie upon any priuciple which would admit of its being nsucn snorter man me reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the reports before you, and asking your attention to them. ' tbs resr erne DEPAsm ext. -It rives me pleasure to report a decided imnrovement in the financial condition of the Post Office Department, as compared with the several preceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $s,349,2S6.40, which embraced tho re venue from all States of the Uaion for three-quarters of that year. Notwithstand ing tbe cessation oi revenue trom the so called Confederate States duriug tho last fiscal year, tbe increase of tho oorreeaoa dence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a revenue during ihe same year of f8.299.829.9U, being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the Uaion the previous year. The expenditures show a still more favorable result The amount expended in 1861. was $13,00,78O.ll. For the last year tho amount hoe been roduced to $11,125,364.13, showing n differes.ee of about $1,487,000 In tho oxnondittirea, as compared with the preceding.. jreaiy .or about $3,750,000, as compared with the fiscal year of 1860. ' The deficiency in the department for the previous year was $4,551,966.98,. For the last fiscal year it wa reduced to 92, 112,814.57. These favorable result are, iu fact, owing to the cessation of mail con veyance in the insurrectionary States, and la part too casual review of all expendi tures in that department, in the interest of economy. EFFICIENCY POSTAL COUVKKTIOS. The efficiency of the postal service it is believed has also been much improved. The Postmaster General also opened a correspondence, through the Department of State, with Foreign Governments, pro posing a convention of postal representa tives, for tho purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to;expedite the foreign mails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted cilizeus and to the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the Government from whom re plies have been received. 1 ask tbe atten tion of Congress to the suggestion of the Postmaster General in his report, respect ing the further legislation required, in his opinion, for tho benefit of the postal service. DEAARTMEXT PF THE INTERIOR. The Secietary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to public lands : The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the 1st of July, 1861, to the 26th of September, 1SC2, the entire cash receipts from the sales of pub lic lands were $137,47726 a sum much less than the expenses of our land system during the same period. The homestead law, which will take effect on the 1st of January next, oflers such inducements to settlers that sales for cash cannot be expected to an extent suf ficient to meet tbe expenses of tbe general land office, and cost of surveying and bringing the land into market The discrepancy between the sums here stated as arising from the sales ot public lands and the sums derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury Department arises as I understand, from the fact that the periods of time, though apparently, were not really coincident at the beginning point. The TVoasury re port iucludes a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the Interior sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by the Inte rior, and not by the Treasury Department. THE INMAS WAR The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, during the past year, manifested a spirit of insubordination, and, at several points, engaged in open hostilities against tbe white settlers in their vicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance to the United States, and entered into a treaty with the insurgents. Those who remained loval to the United States were driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the trib. with the United States. He alleges that they were constrained by supe rior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that the United States neglwcted to furnish the protection which their stij uiation required. THE 1USMSGTA XJt5ACR. Iii the month of August last, the -Sioux InJians in Mirnesota attacked the set- j tiers in their vicinity with ex treme ferocity, killing indiscriminately men, women and hildren. I he attack was wbeliv unex pected, and therefore no deferne had been provided. It is estimated that not less 1 than S00 persons were killed by the Indi- ! an, ana a large auiaunt ot properly was destroyed How this outbreak was induc ed is not indefinitely known; and suspic ions, which may be unjust, need not be stated. Information was received by the Indian Euroau Yrcin different sources, about the time hostilities were commenced, that a Mmuitancous attack was to be made upon i the white settlements by all the tribes i between the Mississippi Kriver aud the Rocky iountains. The Stat of ilinuesoto has suffered great injury from ihe Indian war. A large portion of her territory has been depopu lated, and a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction of property. The peo ple of that Stato manifest much anxiety for the remolal of the tribes beyond the limits of the Ssate, as a guarantee against further hostilities. The Commission of Indian AfTtirs will furnish full details. REMODELING OF INDIA STSTKV. I submit lor your special consideration whether our Indian system shall not be re modeled. Many wise and good men have been impressed with the belief that this can be profitably done. PACIFIC RAILROAD A.tn THE SHIP CASAIA I submit a statement of the proceedings of the commissioners, which shows the progress that Las been made in the enter prise of constructing the Paditic Railroad and thus suggests the earliest completion of the road, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the project now pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in .New lork and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to tbe whole nation, and especially to the vast interior region here inafter to be noticed at some greater length. I propose having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interest ing and valuable statistical informatics up on this subject. The military and com mercial importance of enlarging the Illi nois and Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois Kriver, is presented in the report of Coloael Webster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress. I respectfully ask your attention to it. SHE AGRICULTURAL BLRfAC. To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May last, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of tho United States to be organized. The Commissioner informes me that within the period of a few months this department has established an extensive system of correspond enc and exchanges both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly beneficial results, in the develop ment of a correct knowledge of lecent improvements in agriculture in the intro duction of new product12, a"d in the collec tion of agricultural statistics ef the differ ent States; also-, that it will soon be preparedtodistribute largely seeds, cereals, plants aud cuttings, and has already pub lished and liberally diffuse much valuable information. Ia anticipation of a more elaborate re port which in due time will be published, embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory, the creation of this depaitment was for tbe more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your appro bation, but that it will realize at no distant day all tho fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends, and becorno the fruitful source of advantage to all our people. 1 . " TITB FROCT.AMATIOV OF SEP. 22 O. yja ine -; uay ol September . last a proclamation was issued by tbe Executive a copy ol which is herewith submitted. In accordance with the parpose expressed in the second paragraph ef that paper 1 now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called compensated emanci pation. A natiou may be said to consist of its territory, its people and its laws. The territory is tbe only part which is of cer tain durability. . "One generation nasaeth oway and another generation coroetb, but tbe earth abidetn tor ever, 11 is of tho first importance to duly consider aod esti iaio this ever enduring part . , TBE BHOX OKE AJCO INSEPARABLE. ' ' That portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by ths people of tbe United States is well adapted to the homo of one national family. It is not well adapted' for -two or more.' Its vast extent, aad its variety of climate and pro ductions are of .advantage in Che ago of one people, whatever they might have been in rerwr apee. " steam, and telegrapns aaci iotelligtocfi, bare brought tbxao tohojsja, advantageous combination tor one united people. THE FOLLY OF DlSCinojr. Ia the . Inaugoeral Address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disun ion as.;a remedy for difficulties between the people of the two sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve and which, therefore, I beg to repeat - " THE MATTER 1M A KDTSHRLL. One section of our country believe slave ry is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it to be wrong and ought not "to"' be xt'ended."ThT8 " is' the' only substantial dispute. . The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution and the law, for the suppression of the African slave trade, are each. a well enforced, per baps, as- any 4 law can ever be in a community where tbe V moral sense of the people.-jnperfectly sup port the law itsell. the great ooayorino people abide by the legal obligations in both cases and. a few break over each. This I think cannot be perfectly cured and H would be worse in both instances after the separation "of the sections than before. The foreign slave trade now im perfectly suppressed, would be, ultimately, reviewed without restriction in one section, while fugitives now only partially surren dered would not be surrendered at all to the other. ., .. THE PHPSICAL ARGUMENT AGAINST DISUNION. , Physically spraking, we cannot separate, we cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassible wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the pre sence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different pa-ts of our coup try can not do this. -They cannot remain face to face, and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue bctweea them.. Is it possible tnen to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before. Can afiance make treaties easier than friends can make latest Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends. Suppose you go to war, you can net fight always, and when after much loss on both sides, and bo gain on either, you cease fighting the identical old questions as to terms of interecourse are again upon you. There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a uaitonal boundary unon which to divide. Trace through from East I to West, upon the line between the free i and slave country, and we shall find a lit tle more than one third of it length are rivers easy to be crossed, and populated, ' ore toon to be populated thickly, upon ; both side, while iu nearly all its remain- t ing length are merely surveyors' lines, ; over which people may walk back and j forth without any consciousness of their I presence. iSo part ot this lineman be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper, or parchment, as a national boundary. WHAT SECESSION SURRENDERS. The fact of separation if it comes, gives up on the part of the seceding section, the fugitive slave clause, along with all ether constitutional obligations, upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place. , "THE GREAT LOOT OK THE REPUBLIC." But there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east by the Alleghanies, north by the British Domi nions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the line along which the cultiva tion of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennes see, all of Kentucky, Ohio. Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois. Misouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota and the territories of Decotah, .Nebraska anl a part ot Colorado have about ten million of people, and will have nity millions within ntty years it not pre vented by any political fully or mistake. It contains more than oae third of the country owned by the revolted States certainly, more than one million of surface miles, one half as populous as Massac hu- I setU already is I would have more than than Bpvitnt v-.fii niillif,n of nennW A , - ' . , :'. S,ance "f r"3P .7," A A y he other parts are but inoreinal border to it. 1 he mapniheent region sloping west from the Hockey Mounta'ns to the Pacific being the deepest and also the richest undeveloped resources in the production of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceeds from them. A GREAT IXTERIOR REGIOX. This great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world, ascer tain from the statistics the small propor tion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its prnducts, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect pre sented. And yet this region has no sea coast and touches no ocean anywhere. ITS XATCEAL OUTLETS. As part of one nation, its people now may find and may forever find their way to feurope by New York, to South America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by Saa Francisco. But separate our common country into nations, designed by the pres ent rebellion, and every man in this great interior region is thereby cut of trom some one or more of these outlets, not perhaps by a physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations; and this is true wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed. Place it between the now free and slave country, er place it south of Kentucky, or north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none oouth of it can trade to any port or place north of it, and none north ef it can trade to any port or place south of it, except upon terms dicta ted by a Goverament foreign to them. These outlets East, West,"afc4 South,"" are indispensable to the well-being of the peo ple inhabiting, and to inhabit this vast interior region. Which of the three may be the best is no proper question. All are better than either, and all of right belong to that peo ple and their successors forovor. True to themsalves, they will not ask where a line of separation shall be no such line. A COM M OS 1XTRREST. Nor are the marginal regions less inter ested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world. They do and each one of them must have access to their Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of our national boundary.

With this view I recommend the fol lowing resolution and articles amendatory to the constitution oi tne united States Resolved, By the Senate aad House of Representatives of the; United States of America in Congress assembles!, two thirds of both Houses concurring that tho fol lowing articles be proposed to tho legisla ture or conventions of tho several States as amendments; to the Constitution of the United States, all, or nay of whioh articles when ratified by three-iorthsof tho eaid legislatures or conventions to be valid hs part or parts of tbe sa;d Constitution, namely : - -"- -- - ks: ' COMPIKIATED KAXCIPATIOK.

Article Congress may appropriate money or ptlfrtirlse.7 to provide vfpr colo nizing free colored persons with their eon sent at any place or places within the United Stater.' j? rtr. . f-W THE iR0DETS TBEREFOR. I beg indulgence to discuss these pro posed articles at some length. Without slavery the rebellion should never have existed ; without slavery it could not con tine. Among the friends of the Union there is great' diversity of sentiment and policy in regard tojslavary and tbe. African race amongst us. Some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation, and some would abolish it gradually and with compensation. Some would lemove the free people from among us, and some would retain tbem with; us. and there are yet. other .miner diveFeities. - Because of these diversities we waste much strength in struggles amongst ourselves. By mu tual concession we should harmonize and act together. This would be a compro mMA -among the fronds and hot" with enemies o tne Union.4 J nese articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concession. If the plan shall be adopted, it is' assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in several of the States. r f tt W A a -x : i RARMOX1ZIIG DIFFERENCES.; :; U In tEe first article tbe main points are Ftrst, Tbe 'emancipation. H Steond, The length of time for consummating, in years ; and Third, The compensation. The . emancipation : will be unsatisfac tory to the advocates of perpetual slavery, but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissati-f.iotion. The time saves both races fioui the evils of sudaen derangement, while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be dis turbed by the measure, will have passed away before its consummation. They will never see it. Another class will hail the prospeet ef emancipation, but will de precate the length of time. They will feel that it goes for little to the now living I slaves, but it really gives them much. It ' saves them from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where the cir cumstance are very great, and it gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shaft be free forever. The plan leaves to each State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end of the century, or at any inter mediate time, or by degrees extending over the whole or any part of that period ; aud it obliges no two States to proceed alike. ' It also provides for compensation, : ani generally the mode or making it. j This, it would seem, must further mitigate i the dissatisfaction of those who favor per ! petual slavery, especially those who are to I receive corarxMication i t wnx rovrE.vsATr. Doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive will object to it . That j the measure is both just and economical 1 is certain. The liberation of the Maves is j the destruction of property, acquired by i descent or pilrchase, the, same as ar.y other property. It is no less true for hav ! ing been often said, that the paople of the I South are1 no more responsible for the in i troduction of this property than are the ! people of the North ; and when it is re j niembered how unhesitatingly we all ue cotton and sugar, and share the profits nf dealing in them, it may net be o,uite safe to say that the Soutb has been more re sponsible than the North for its continu ance. If, then, for a common object, this property is to be sacrificed, is it not jut that it be done at a common charge ? And if with less money, or money more easily paid, we caa preserve tho benefits of tbe Union by this meaas, than we can by the war alone, is it uot economical to do it ? AX ECONOMICAL VIF.W. Let us consider it then ; let u aertain me sum we nave expended in the war since compensated emancipation wa pro posed last March, and consider whether, if that measure had ben promptly accepted by even some of the slave States, the same sum would not have done more to close the war thari has been otherwise done. If so, tbo 'measure would save money and ia that view, would be a prudent "and eco nomical measure, certainly.. It is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing, but it is easier te pay a large sum than a larger oae . . The aggregate sum necessary for com pensated emancipation of course would be large, but it would require no ready cash nor bonds any faster than the emancipa tion progresses. SHARI.tG TBE BCRDEX WITH rOSTKRITT. This" might not aad probably would not close before the end of thothirty-evea years. At that time we shall probably have 400,000,000 people to share the bur den instead of 31,000,000 as now, and not only so, bnt the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after tbe period as rapidly as before, because our territories will not have be come full. I dot state this inconsiderate ly. At the same ratio of increase which wo have maintained on an average from our first national census in 1790 until 1860, we should in 1900 have a population of 103.208,415, and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period. OCR TERRITORY. ' Our abundant Toom, our broad national homesteads, is an ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British isles, certainly our population c uld not expand as stated.. Instead of receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled to send part ot the native bom away, but such is not our condition. We have 2,963,000 of square miles. Europe has 3,809,000 square miles, with a popula tion averaging 73 1-3 persons to the square lnile,ivVbjr raffyhot'otrfc'oonrpf at sdme time average as many ? Is it less fertile?
