TAFT FAVORS EXPOSITION. President Ask3 Authority to Appe : nr Commission to Outline Plans. President Taft has given his cord';* indorsement to the projnjsed semicen tennial exposition suggested for 1913 to mark the progress the Negro has made in the tifty years of his freedom and to indicate the wonderful advance the race has made since its landing in this country nearly 300 years ago. The movement was tailed to the attention of the president not long ago by Dr. Booker T. Washington. In his first annual message to con gress President Taft said of the pro posed demonstrative exposition: “The year 1913 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the issuance of the emancipation proclamation which gave freedom to the Negroes in the United States. It seems fitting that this event should be properly celebrated. Already a movement has been started by prom inent colored people and newspa pers not only in the south, but in oth er parts of the country. The south especially is manifesting its interest in such a celebration. “It is suggested that a proper form of celebration would be an exposition which would show the progress which the millions of Negroes have made not only during their period of freedom, but which would also Indicate their progress from the time of their com ing to this country. “I heartily Indorse the proposed ex position and suggest that the execu tive be authorized to appoint a pre liminary commission of not more than seven persons to consider carefully whether or not it is wise to hold such an exposition, and. if so, to outline a plan for the enterprise. I further rec ommend that such preliminary com mission serve without salary except ns to their actual expenses and that an appropriation be made to meet such expenses.”
