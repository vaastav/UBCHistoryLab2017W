The door closed, and Pinckney turned to Mrs. Durant "Did you see that?" he excfelmed. "She's going to the door with him? going right out there wun nun. i never saw anything like it in my life." "Frances* mother smiled Indulgently. "Well, what if she is?" she said. "For goodness sake, Edward, let the child be polite." Pinckney was losing all vestige of caution and self control. "She's in love with him. I tell you, she's in love with him." Mrs. Durant smiled. "Frances in love with Mr. Sommers! Why, Edward you're ridiculous." The man was walking up and down the floor excitedly. . Now he stopped in front of her. "Ridiculous nothing!" he exclaimed. "You won't say it's ridiculous when this penniless adventurer carries her off right under your eyes. I tell you, ^ it isn't safe. He's not the kind of man to be with Frances. I should have M 111 m & "She's in love with him. I tell you the'* tn love with him." protested before. I'm sorry I didn't I V tell you. Mrs. Durant it makes my ' blood boil to see it I can't stand it. I won't stand it" "Edward!" Mrs. Durant was not smiling now. Her face was stern, grim, almost like her husband's. "Do you realize what you're saying?" she ^ demanded sternly. "It isn't for you to ** \ criticise what Frances does one way or another. I will attend to that. Her father and I have charge of her and no one else. For you to make any such speech is presumptuous." u* Pinckney bowed, rebuked. "I'm sorry," he said. "I suppose I was presumptuous, but."?his voice broke with real feeling, a feeling of fear and disappointed ambition that Mrs. Durant mistook for love?"it is hard after the dreams I've had and the plans we've made. I tell you, it's a fearful thing to stand by and see you and Mr. Durant calmly helping this sailor to win her." Mrs. Durant smiled appealingly. "Now, now, Edward," she said. "You take it too seriously. You know that George and I have no idea of helping him to win her. If any one is helping him you are the.one." Plnckney looked at her amazed. "I?" he exclaimed. ? ^ Frances' mother nodded. * "Exactly." she said. You are helping him by your very apparent jealousy. There is nothing that will spur a girl to be particularly nice to one man so much as a knowledge that ^ some one she cares for is seeing and writhing." Pinckney opened his eyes. Like many another schemer, he had devoted all his time to circumventing men. r and he really knew comparatively nt^ tie about women. "But she hasn't seen that I notice It." he protested. She's been too busy with him to notice anything." The mother laughed out loud at hi? bitter tone. "Nonsense, Edward. Mr. Sommers is a nice young man, and I don't blame her for enjoying his visits. Goodness knows, nice young men are not so plentiful in Pittsburg." Pinckney looked at her reproachfully. "I thought you at least were on my tide." he complained. "I didn't expect you'd be against me." 6 < He sat down in a big chair and ttared gloomily at the fire. Mrs. Durant came over to rest one hand affectionately on his shoulder. "I am on your side, Edward." she said seriously. "You know that. You know perfectly well that her father and I both hope with all our hearts that some day we shall see you two married." He turned eagerly and, reaching up, caught her hand. "Then why don't you speak to her ? of It?" he exclaimed. "Let her understand your wishes." The woman looked down on him X with a pitying smile. "You poor boy!" she said. "You must be desperate. You want me to m propose for you. Well, if George Du rant had come to my mother"? She ended with a nod almost savage. "Perhaps he did for all you know." exclaimed Pinekne.v. "No. he didn't. She was dead." snapped Prances' mother. "Now. you poor thing, don't be so tragic. Sommers will go in a day or so. and in a few weeks he may bo ordered to the north pole or the equator or goodness V knows where. At an> ra*e he'll be out of her way and yours. See her to. Igiit. Talk with her. Let her see how you feel toward her. Now is a ^ g>od time. She's coming back. I'll Vjf* leave you." ' But It was the butler instead of Frances, as expected, that entered the room. tireless 1 ' Thompson Bnchaaaa From the \ tfbI Play of the Same Name |, HELL SMITH, FREDERIC ![ )N and PAUL ARMSTRONG |i Fredaric Thompson. All Kifbt* Referred. 1 ( "Fllklns, where Is Miss Durant?" asked Plnckney sharply. The butler turned. "On the veranda with the navy gentleman, sir," he said. Meanwhile, "outside on the veranda, Frances Durant and Lieutenant Som mers stood side by side in the darkness saying goodby. Back of them, shut off with the heavy hall doors, was | the lighted house. In front, far below, showed the bright windows of the steel works, where the night shift tolled. Now and again, at irregular Intervals, the sky was lighted with a sudden glare of the huge chimneys that blazed up and then died abruptly, leaving the night blacker than before. For a time they stood looking out at the distant lights and the silence. At last It was the girl who spoke. "And tomorrow night you will be down there toiling, watching, waiting, as they forge the gun which is to make your fame." she said softly. "And you?" he asked. Just as low. In the darkness she looked up at him. , "And I," she said?"I shall be up here Just where I am now, watching the u-v*- *KJ?lrln<r onH nrQVlnC that UglllS OJ1U iiiiimuio M**v> r.Wtr ...0 all will be well." Again they stood In silence for a ! time. Then the man sighed. "I am afraid to come back again," he began unsteadily. "I think I had betI ter say goodby to you tonight." She moved slightly closer. "Afraid?" It was a taunt tremulously given. "Yes," he blurted. "I am afraid, and you know why." She did not answer, and he rushed on, speaking low, eagerly, yet bitterly. "You know I can't tell you what I wish to say. I haven't really the right. I am a penniless naval officer and you the daughter of the biggest steel man in the country. I haven't the right." "What is it you wish to say?" she asked insistently. She was so close their hands touched as he turned toward her. And, touching, the hands clung together. "You know what I wish to say," he exclaimed. "If I had the right I'd tell you how much I love you. I'd tell you how from the first moment I saw you I wanted you, and you only. I'd tell you how I never have lived until I knew you and the rest of my life must be one dreary blank of grinding duty because I must lose you. I'd tell you th.it life with you would be more happiness than any man has the right wnu hot TV1 rflthPP lu nave. x u irn ww> . ?. have one year of you than a million years on earth and all the honors that men could give me. I'd tell you"?he broke off bitterly for a second, then repeated?"I'd tell you enough to make you realize what an absolutely dreaming, idiotic fool I am, but I'd tell you enough to make you know how I suffer because I haven't the right to really tell you anything." In the darkness the girl laughed a low laugh of pure delight. "You are an absolute, idiotic, dreaming fool," she said, so softly, so tenderly, that he could not but understand. ' "Frances!" He barely breathed her name. Then all reply was cut off, for she was in his arms with her own arms about his neck and their lips were tight together. It was nearly half an hour later when Frances Durant, her cheeks flushed, her eyes misty with happiness, 1 opened the big front door and stepped back into the lighted hall. So much had happened in that short time. She had gone out an anxious, worried girl. She re-entered a glowing woman, loved and loving, sure of herself and happily confident of the future. They were not engaged. No, indeed! They had solemnly assured each other of that fact. It would not do at all for the penniless naval officer to formally ask the hand of the steel king's daughter! But when his gun had been a great success and fame had come to him then he was to come and make his formal plea and ask her father for her hand. And she would be waiting eagerly for her lover, ready with her answer and prepared, no matter what happened, to follow him to the ends of the earth. Edward Pinckney looked up with a sneer as she entered the library. "Oh, he's gone, has he?" he said contemptuously. The girl was too happy to mind the tone. "You mean Mr. Sommers?" she said, affecting to misunderstand. "Yes; he's gone." "Of course I mean that naval whippersnapper. Who do you suppose I meant?" he replied sharply. "You ought to have more sense. Frances, than to stand out on that Cold DorCO. You're likely to catch pneumonia or anything." The girl smiled slightly. "Oh, I wasn't cold," she said. "I've been waiting to speak to you," began Pinckney again. "It's about something important." Frances was in no mood for long, dull conversation. She wanted to get away by herself to think over the last half hour, to feel again the thrill of his touch, to near again in her imagination the sound of his voice. So she spoke somewhat impatiently. "Won't tomorrow do. Edward?" He shoo!: his head with decision. "No; tomorrow won't do. Frances. I want to talk to you to light about something in which I an interested and in which your mother and father are interested also?something which we all wish to bring about." The girl yawned. She did not have the least idea what he was going to say. "Oh, very well, Edward, if it's anything you wish and mother and father wish, too, just consider that I have agreed and let it go at that. Don't worry me." He stepped toward her suddenly and before she realized it had put his arm about her. "Then we may announce the engagement at once," he said masterfully. The girl recoiled, then tore herself from his arms. "No," she said sharply, "you will not announce any engagement of mine if you mean yourself as the man." His face darkened. "You mean you don't care for me?" he demanded. She looked at him with a smile. "Of course I care for you, Edward; we've been brought up together. I've looked on you as a sort of big brother, but I don't care for you the least bit in the way you mean, and I never will." "Ycu mean you won't marry me?" he demanded angrily. "Of course I won't marry you when I don't care for you," she retorted, beginning to lose her temper in turn. "Are you out1 of your senses? I've "You mean you won't marry met* he demanded angrily. never had any idea of marrying you, Edward. I will never have such an idea*" Pinckney saw all his dreams begin to tumble. It made him angry, desperate. "You will marry me!" he exclaimed, stepping toward her. "I tell you you will marry me! What do you think I am?a fool? Do you sunppose I'm an Idiotic, dreaming fool?" The repetition of that phrase which she had heard so recently roused the girl to fierce anger. "Yes." she cried, "you are a dream ing, idiotic fool if you think I'm going to marry you or anybody else I don't love, whether you wish it or mother and father wish it or the whole world wlohes it. Understand that once and for all." Good night." And, turning, she started for the door. Pinckney's face was convulsed with rage. His hands were twitching. He could hardly control himself. "Then you're going to marry this dirty adventurer, Sommers, are you?" he almost shouted. The girl stopped short and whirled about, facing him. Her cheeks were bright, her eyes blazing with anger. "I'm going to marry the man I love, Edward Pinckney!" she exclaimed in a voice of controlled anger. "And that man will never be you. That's all you need know. He will never be you. Good night." To be Continued. A Doctor's Sharp Reply. A West Point physician today received a personal letter from . It was a well written advertisement and closed by saying: "If there is any reason why you do not buy of us please give us your reasons in the enclosed Btamped envelope and we will strive to remove the cause." The physician answered as follows: Your letter of recent date asking why I had not traded with you for a long time received, and as you ask me to tell you frankly why I will give you a few reasons: First?I am in business in this com munity and am looking to this community with Its varied Industries for my support. I cannot ask the merchants of this town for their support if I do not give them mine. Second?In looking over my books I fall to find either Mr. , Mr. or other of the company's names, which reminds me that neither of these gentlemen have ever given me a penny's patronage. Why is this? Am I too far away, or have neither of them needed a physician, or are they afraid of the mail order plan when it comes to the practice of medicine? I can certainly give as good satisfaction by mail as your house can, and will appreciate a call_from either of them when in need of medical service. Third?In looking over the subscription lists for improving our streets and uublic highways I have failed to find the name of either member of your firm down for one penny to assist In the work. Also I have failed to find your name on any of the charity lists where help has been rendered to our poor; In other words, you are not down as a contributor to our Helping Hand society. In fact, In all the movements for the betterment of our condition, where our community has needed the united efforts of her public-spirited citizens, I have failed to find your name among the list of our contributing merchants. Your name is not on our city tax books, nor do I find where you have paid a city license to do a mercantile business in competition with our home merchants. These are a few answers to your questions and I trust you will see the Justice of them.?West Plains (Mo.) Daily Quill. A Million Ancestors.?It may be a little surprising and of interest to learn that a person may have had more than a million ancestors within comparatively recent years, and that without taking into account uncles and aunts. Starting with one's parents, each person. of course, has two. a father and a mother. The father had his two parents, and the mother had hers. Thus each person has four grandparents. One step farther, and we have eight great-grandparents. A simple calculation gives the astonishing result that our lineal ancestors during twenty generations number no fewer than 1,048,576, or sufficient people, if all living, to populate the whole of Wales.?Dundee Advertiser. ittioccllanmta iJcartin^. THE PRESIDENT'S ME8SAtic. Long Document Full of Important Recommendations. Washington, Dec. 7.?Having assembled and received the president's annual message, congress today found itself literally "out of work" and in consequence botn houses adjourned until Friday, when if some of the various I committees rail to provide someming i to do, adjournment will be taken until I Monday next 'I'he formality of reading the message aloud consumed about an hour and a half of the time of each house today. When the conclusion was reached the house Immediately adjourned, but the senate remained in session for some time afterwards, an executive session being held before that body adjourned. Summary of Mettage. Opposition to the proposed Immediate congressional investigation of the sugar Import scandals in the New York custom house, and likewise to any further revision of the tariff at present; absence of any specific recommendation regarding the crisis in Nicaragua, and actual recommendations of legislation to forbid the issuance of judicial injunctions in labor without notice in labor controversies and for the establishment of a system of postal savings banks, may be considered the most striking features of the first annual message of President Taft to congress. The Nicaraguan question, conservation of the nation's natural resources, needed amendments to the anti-trust and interstate commerce acts, and the contemplated revision of the Federal statutes governing the organization of the armed forces of the nation in time of war are all reserved for possible frootmont lotor I n anoriol mpgga cab in his message, which bulks some 17,000 words, Mr. Taft reports the country to be "in a high state of prosperity" and he adds that "there is every reason to believe that we are on the eve of a substantial business expansion, and we have just garnered a harvest unexampled in the market value of our agricultural products." The president expresses entire confidence that the duty imposed upon the executive, of enforcing the maximum rates of the new tariff law against nations unduly discriminating against the United States will not provoke any tariff war, and he favors no further tariff tinkering at least until the new tariff commission shall have completed its work of gathering information as to toe relative cost of producing dutiable articles in this country and abroad. This task he expects will occupy two or three years. Projects Recommended. Projects recommended by the president, in addition to those mentioned above, include: A ship subsidy to encourage American shipping. Publicity of political contributions in elections of members of congress. Civil pensions. A higher rate of postage on periodicals and magazines. A fund of $50,000 to aid in suppressing the "white slave" trade. A commission to evolve a plan to expedite legal procedure and mitigate the "law's delays." Construction of an artificial island and fortification in the entrance to Chesapeake bay, two battleships and one repair ship for the navy and the establishment of an extensive naval base at Pear Island, Hawaii. A national bureau of health. Statehood for New Mexico and Arizona, and an appointive governor and executive council for Alaska. Civil control of the light house board and separation of the national astronomical observatory from naval control. Celebration in 1913 of the semi-centennial of negro emancipation, and reimbursement of the depositors of the defunct Freedman's Trust and Savings Company. Consolidation of the bureaus of manufactures and statistics in the department of commerce and labor. Appropriation for the remodeling of the District of Columbia jail. Central American Affairs. Calling attention to the crisis in Central American affairs brought about by ine summary excuunun m mtaiaguu of two Americans, the president announces that this government has terminated diplomatic relations with the Zelayan administration in Nicaragua and intends to take such further steps as may be found most "consistent with its dignity, its duty to American interests and its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization." In opposing any immediate investigation of the New York custom house scandal the president takes the ground that such investigation "might, by giving immunity and otherwise, prove an embarrassment in securing conviction of the guilty parties." A proposal submitted by the secretary of the treasury that the executive department's deficit for the current fiscal year?estimated at $73,075,620?be met by the issuance of Panama bonds authorized by congress, is approved by the president. He explains that in order to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, estij ho\*o hoon out tn thp hona instead of a deficit there will be a surplus of $35,931,000, excluding payments on the Panama canal which are expected to be taken care of by bonds. The president records with pleasure the satisfactory arrangement made for the arbitration of the important North American fisheries issue with Canada and the successful prosecution of the work of the commissions adjusting other boundary Issues and the lake fisheries. He urges an international conference to devise measures for the protection of fur seals. He is hopeful of a happy adjustment of the Congo question and expresses his desire to afford a larger measure of protection to the '"* T 

IUAMI? IIIIIP IICKIII siaie 01 liiuri m. ouusiaitlon Is expressed with the declaration by Japan and Russia In favor of the "open door" and appropriations are asked for the expenses of the PanAmerican congress to be held In Buenos Ayres and for participation In the Belgian exposition, both scheduled for next year. Postoffice Deficit. "The total deficit for the last fiscal year in the postoffice department amounted to J 17,500.000. The branches i of its business which it did at a loss were the second-class mall service, In which the loss as already said was $63,000,000, and the free rural delivery In which the loss was $28,000,000. These losses were In part offset by the profits of the letter postage and other sources of Income. It would seem wise to reduce the loss upon second-class mail matters, at least to the extent of preventing a deficit In the total operations of the postofflce." Political Contribution*. "I urgently recommend to congress that a law be passed requiring that candidates In elections of members of the house of representatives and committees In charge of their candidacy and campaign, file in a proper office of the United States government a statement of the contributions received and of the expenditures Incurred in the campaign for such elections, and that similar legislation be enacted In respect to all other elections which are constitutionally within the control of congress." Little fault was found with the message among the Republicans, who seemed to agree that It was as satisfactory a document as the president could prepare and remain consistent with the party's campaign pledges. rne Democrats approved or tne president efforts to economize, but deprecated his suggeetlon that the Monroe doctrine had practically become obsolete. "The message Is written In the president's customary terse, vigorous style," commented Representative Payne, the majority leader In the house, while Representative Clark, minority leader, thought about all that could be said about the message was that It was comparatively brief, "as discussion of almost all Important matters is relegated to special messages." In both houses the message was subjected to the most careful scrutiny and while the members paid little attention to the perfunctory reading of It by the clerks, they burled their heads between Its pages and digested as much of It aa theu cnnlrt at nne readlnar. Following the custom the message was referred to the committee of the Whole by both branches to be prepared for "vivisection" by the various committees whose business it is to deal with the subjects discussed by the president in his message. The senate adjourned at 2.30 o'clock out of respect to the memory of Representatives De Armond of Missouri and Lasslter of Virginia. The house adjourned at 1.45 o'clock. 

MAGIC MACE OF CONGRE88. Compels Wrangling 8o|ons to Observe the Peace. When the blood of congress is redhot, and there are scenes of wild dis- i order on the floor of the house; when expostulation and the speaker's gavel i fail to quiet the tempest among the representatives, there is just one thing left to do. "Get the mace!" cries the speaker. Instantly, as if by magic, while the great mace is carried about the house, the most obstreperous congressman i sinks into his seat. Tou can almost hear a pin drop way up in the visitor's gallery. In 1 fact, the appearance of this symbol of authority has never yei iaueu iu restore order. 1 Yet, there have been new members I of congress who for months have never even noticed the elaborate ceremony of the mace that is enacted at the opening of every day's sitting, so ' quietly it is done. If you should 1 stand in the speaker's lobby Just be- I fore noon, this is what you would see ' beneath the portraits of former Speakers, Blaine, Stevenson, Polk, I Clay, Pennington, "Czar" Reed, and ' the rest. Congressmen are passing through ' the swinging doors. Up in the gallery, < for an hour or more, spectators have 1 been crowding in to get the choice seats. In their two corners the pages gossip In subdued tones. A newspa- ' per man, perhaps, is sketching con gressmen as they read at their desks, ' while several others interview -chair- I men of committees. A few constitu- ' ents walk proudly on the floor, fingering in their pockets passes good for that day until eleven-forty-flve. Just then the clerk very formally requests artists, reporters, and visl- 1 laotfo tho flnnr filrfcwlv f h P I hands of the clock approach each ' other at noon. The blind chaplain I feels his way through the aisle. ' And then, If you are looking toward the east entrance, you will see a page with his hands tightly clasped about ! a massive, silver-bound, ebony staff, J coming from the office of the ser- ' geant-at-arms. Through the lobby ' he walks and into the chamber, bear- 1 ing the mace. Then he quietly de- 1 posits it by the side of a pedestal of 1 malachite near the speaker's desk. ' "Uncle Joe" comes swinging in from his room, climbs the steps to ! his dais, and, if he happens to have his famous cigar, lays It down care- 1 fully, lighted end out, so as not even s to scorch the marble. ' The speaker is punctual as the 1 clock. Just at the dot of twelve he seizes his gavel. As it is poised aloft ' an instant, the great mace is elevated 1 to its pedestal. Down comes the gavel ' with a crash. "The house will be in < order!" says the speaker. Instantly conversation stops. Congress is in session. The blind chaplain < feels his way through a prayer as he i did down the aisle. With the "Amen" scarcely over, instantly pendemonlum 1 breaks out again. The Journal is read, ' and no one pays any attention to that. 1 The day's work has begun. J There the magic mace remains on ' its pedestal until the house goes into < the committee of the whole. Then it Is lowered, and remains lowered until the committee rises. Again it is t elevated to its pedestal. 1 After the session is over the page i reverently bears it back to the of- < flee of the sergeant-at-arms again? the symbol of the authority and dig- t nlty of the representatives of the peo- t pie of these United States in congress s assembled. f But that Is not all. If It were not 1 profane, one might suggest t'- :t the < chief office of the symbol a>. those times when the speaker has to say, t "Get the mace!" Is much like the ef- < feet of "Get the hook!" on amateur 5 night at a popular theater. I Take, for Instance, the latest oc- I caslon when It was used, in February of this year, the first time, as a mat ter of fact, for a number of years when recourse was had to It. The general deficiency bill had been reported, and was being read when Mr. John Wesley Oaines, of Tennessee, arose and called out: "Mr. Speaker." He was told by the speaker that he was out of order. To which he retorted, hotly, that the rules of the house were changed so often that one couldn't tell when he was In order? even the speaker had to keep a man to post him. The Retort Discourteous. The speaker rapped the gravel angrily. "The gentleman from Tennessee is absolutely discourteous." "The gentleman from Tennessee is no more discourteous than the speaker." replied Mr. Gaines. Instantly there was an uproar, the speaker ordering the gentleman to take his seat, and the gentleman remaining standing. Finally the speaker turned and said: "The sergeant-at-arms will enforce order. Get the mace!" The eagle-surmounted staff was taken from its dusty resting place, and the sergeant started in the direction of the bllllgerent Mr. Gaines. Reluctantly, he dropped back into his seat, and the mace was restored to its place on the green pedestal at the right of the dais. This wonderful symbol was, as we shall see, borrowed from the usage of the English house of commons, after which the house of representatives was closely modeled by the framers of our constitution. The first mace was destroyed by fire when the British burned the capitol in 1814. From 1814 to 1834 a mace of painted wood did service but In the later year, the present mace was made after the model of the original. The date, 1841, Is engraved on it, but that was done at a time when it was repaired and remounted. The mace is about three feet high, and weighs about twenty pounds. It consists uf a bundle of ebony rods thirteen in number, one for each of the original thirteen states, bound together with a band of silver, after the fashion of the old Roman fasces. From the center of this bundle of rods protrudes a silver stem, on which ii a silver globe, four or five inches in diameter. Surmounting the globe is an eagle of solid silver with outstretched wings. Such is the peace-restoring instrument of congress, which has been used on some notable occasions. Let a storm arise, and words and fists come in evidence, and the mace appears borne aloft majestically in the area in front of the speaker's desk, up the main aisle, and down the side aisles, calming the quickened pulses, calling the house to its sober Belf. The congress that held the record ror us use was me nuy-nnii uoos? 1891) where it was used five times. Perhaps Speaker Cannon remembered, while he was conjuring Mr. Gaines, the several times in 1890 when the mace was used?once against himself. Things were different then. To be sure, they were revising the ; tariff, but the present house dictator was only a member on the floor and the Immortal Dictator Reed was i speaker. Here is what happened during this record-breaking session: 1 The first time the mace was used was on January 31, 1890, when the Democrats made a fight against the < speaker's assumption to count a quorum under what he called general parliamentary law. There was an attempt to unseat Judge Jackson, of : West Virginia. The galleries were packed, and the whole house was in an uproar. < Even the careful John G. Carlisle i became so excited that he rushed down the aisle, demanding recognition. On the Democratic side, Mills, < Breckinridge, McMillan, Crisp, Bland i and others, clamored to be heard. At the same time, McKlnley, Grosvenor, Rowell, Cannon, and other Re- i publicans, claimed the floor, and < shouted at the top of their voices: ' Regular order:" Out of the chaos strode the tall Mr. i Bynum, down to the front desks, and ivlth powerful lungs, gave the speaker i an execration that boomed like a 1 bass horn. The galleries were In uproar. Vainly the speaker strove to I get the house In order. Then the l mace was brought out. " I Oil on the Waters. It was supposed, at first, that the i sergeant-at-arms Intended to arrest < Mr. Bynum, and a brawny Illinoisian s stood by him, prepared to resist. But 1 the mace was merely carried up the main aisle and down the side aisle, imld turbulent knots of members. It , was like oil on troubled waters. The , jxcitement died as quickly as It arose. , rhe members seemed to recognize the , significance of the symbol. Again, on May 14 of the same year, , the mace was In use. The house was ( sitting In the committee of the whole { >n the McKinley bill. General Grosrenor, of Ohio, was In the chair. , There was a bitter personal dispute Detween Mr. Bynum and General Bayne, of Pennsylvania, concerning :he character of a glass manufacturer >f Pittsburg. The confusion became terrible. Three-quarters of the members were >n their feet at once, shouting, applauding. and hissing. At the height of the controversy, VIr. Bynum said that the glass manjfacturer was a liar and a perjurer, ind that, furthermore, he himself had lust as great confidence in the manifacturer's character as he had In the :haracter of General Bayne. The Fight That Failed. General Cutcheon demanded that he words be taken down, and the con'usion became worse than a bridge ush. Fists were raisea, miu iwn?d as If a free fight would result. s Just then the deputy sergeatn-at- 1 irms. Mr. Cavanaugh, appeared with t he mace. Though the members were t (Imply boiling over with rage, they t lank back in their seats, and the < louse became so still that whispers ] ;ould be heard. i Later that same night, Mr. Bynum ,vas censured in front of the speak- I jr's desk, surrounded by Democratic t iympathizers, for refusing to go to 1 tils, seat when ordered by Speaker t fteed. The mace was not ordered out ?it had done enough for one day. c The third occasion came on June r 25, while the Force Bill was under discussion. There had been a sharp exchange of personalities between Mr. Cftnnon and John H. O'Neall, of Indiana. Mr. O'Neall had made a cutting allusion to alleged purchasing of votes In Mr. Cannon's district, and "Uncle Joe" was on Are in an irstant. He had the floor, and was therefore able to shut off Mr. O'Neall frbm re piying. The hubbub became universal. On the Democratic side were cries of "Fair play! Fair play!" Meanwhile the Republicans cheered Mr. Cannon and howled "Regular order!" Mr. O'Neall was very angry and insisted on being heard. Nor did he.stop Insisting until the mace came down the aisle where he was standing. Then it was over. Two months later, on August 26, the services of the mace were again required during the exciting scenes attending the passage of the Conger Land Bill by the house. Three minutes after Mr. Cannon's celebrated reply to Mr. McAdoo there was an actual collision on the Republican side of the house. Blows were exchanged, and the floor became like bedlam. Again the great mace went down V?a nlolfl onrt I? n fo ur aonrvriH a nrHnr was restored. The last time It was used during that congress was in the turbulence and wild commotion caused by the effort of the speaker to suppress Mr. Roger Q. Mills. The terms "traitor" and "treason" were being handed about rather freely, and some promiscuous profanity flooded into the argument. Every one expected a flst-flght, at least; but the mace, as usual, proved efficient, and things were soon quiet again. The Fiftieth Congress, Just preceding that one, had, in all, two occasions calling for the mace. But the worst single occasion of all was the time when it was required during the disorder in the Thirty-Sixth Congress, 1859?1861. Bad as scenes have been in other congresses, they have borne no comparison to those in this one, which grew out. of a dispute between Messrs. Keitt and Oow, Just before the war. Then there was a real flght on the floor of the house. Mr. Barksdale, of Mississippi, who attempted to interfere, lost his artificial scalp. Men were floored with cuspidors. Vainly, at first, the mace was carried up and down the aisles; for the time being nothing availed. But finally, as the symbol majes ncany muveu uuuui me uuuk, who after another of the participants in this unprecedented fracaa recognized It. Though the bitterness remained, the contestants respected the dignity of the symbol. Congressman McCall said recently that the house of representatives "is the most disorderly and noisiest legislative body In the world." But even then It has never broken up the furniture, piled It In the center of the room, and had Its picture taken standing on the ruins, as a Hungarian legislature did several years ago. But, of course, Hungary had no mace. Still, though the British house of commons has a mace, on occasions of disorder there it has been the police who Anally restored the peace. The Mace of King Charles. The history of the British mace is mil** Intaroatlnir When the first one was made, no one knows; but, after the execution of King Charles I, in 1649, a new form of mace was demanded, more befitting the commonwealth, and savoring less of royalty. The royal mace had been surmounted by a crown of crosses and fleursde-lis. The new one had a coronet formed of St. George's crosses for England and harps for Ireland, and bore engraved on It; "The Freedom of England by God's blessing restored." Above the coronet were four sprays of oak-leaves meeting, not with a ball and cross as before, but with the arms of England and Ireland on an acorn. This was used until 1663, when Cromwell bade one of his soldiers "Take away that fool's bamble." Several cities, like Kingston, Jamaica, claim to have this mace now, but really it was brought back later. ( In 1660 a new mace was made for | the house of commons. It stands about Tour feet high. Its head consists of four royal badges, with the Initials, "C. R.," and the royal arms of ( Charles II., surmounted by a royal ( irown with an orb and cross. The *haft is chased with roses and thisties. 1 When the Mace Was a Club. , Antiquarians tell us that It Is prob- ; lbly composed of the shaft of the old . mace of the days of Cromwell, to , ivhlch was added a new head In place y it the old one, in 1660. t So that the famous "bauble" Is not \ eally lost or reposing in some far-off < :lty, but Is still borne in front of the ] jpeaker of the house of commons. I The mace was originally, of course, ] i weapon of offense, and its recogni- ] tion as a symbol of power or authori;y came later. As a weapon, it had i tearing, crushing effect on armor, iue to its original flanged head. When pistols came in the mace be- j :ame a symbol only and, from being , jseful, became merely ornamental. , Then it contracted all the later aristic additions. j Civic maces were military maces ( urned upside down. Kings, judges, | nlnlsters, and other officials had a | Iking for the mace with its fine metal t vork and carvings. It took its place , vith the sword of state. j It was the mark of Judicial or execu- ] ;lve authority. The sergeant-at or j )f-mace was for ages invested with | ;eremonial authority in the house of i ,'ommons. In the Tower of London are maces, , icepters, and rods in great profusion. There is St. Edward's mace, which ] veighs ninety pounds, and is a gol- i ien staff surmounted by a ball con- I alnlng a piece of the "true cross." i Dther royal scepters are those of the i Dove of Victoria, Mar\, and Maria | i'Este. ] Many cities in Great Britain still * lave maces, or are authorized to have t hem. Most famous is that of the s -ord Mayor of London, dating from t he fifteenth century. ' It is still carried in his ponderous s oach on state occasions. The kingli eeeives the sword of the city, but 11 not the mace. This same mace was used In giving thanks for the destruction of the Spanish Armada, in 1588. It is a staff nearly two feet long, surmounted with gold and pearls, rubies and sapphires, in the shape of crosses and fleurs-de-lis. Canterbury has a mace dating from James I. Tork has a silver mace. Winchester has one, and Southampton has two large ones and a small one. Olastonbury has one which is three hundred years old. Carlisle has a famous mace, while Edinburgh has one, bearing the date 1C17, made of gilt silver, with a crown and the national emblems. Some forty other towns have maces, including Oxford and Cambridge, with gilt-silver maces and small maces for the town sergeants. Bristol has nine maces. Some of these municipal maces are so arranged that the tops can be taken off and used as drlnklng-cupe at civic banquets, being filled with water for the higher officials and spiced ale for the lesser. But the mace has even a more ancient and honorable origin. Under the old Roman republic the magistrates went from one place to another on foot, setting up little courts here and there, and executing sentences on the 8pot. They wero accompanied by a small body of men called lictors, who made way for them, made arrests, executed sentences. Each lictor carried a bundle of rods tied together with thongs and having an ax bound to the outside of it. The thongs were used for scourging, the ax for beheading, and the rods for beating. These bundles were known as fasces and in time came to be the symbol of authority. When the magistrates passed, the fasces were borne aloft ahead of them. If disorder arose, the fasces appeared; and all Roman citizens, upon the mere sight, were required to be orderly. When the Romans conquered Brit* aln they, of course, brought In the use of the fasces, and, like many other Roman customs, this remained with the British people. It was no longer used in inflicting punishment, but became merely a symbol?the badge of office. The Ancient Symbol. The great councils of the early Saxons developed into one general body in the fourteenth century, which became known as the house of commons. In all the early councils the use of the fasces was continued, but it became to be known as the "mace," and gradually the Roman fasces.and the English military mace grew Into one symbol of legislative authority. And so it Is that the "American fasces" is really much more than a mere name. It is the symbol of everything that underlies the modern Anglo-Saxon theory of representative government?respect for law and order, which makes modern civilisation possible. It is a matter worth noting that in nanllamAnls tvhora nA mOAA AT. lets, disorder is far more frequent and violent than it is, for example, at Westminster or Washington. Is this coincidence, or temperament, or The Mace? THE 

PRICE OF QENIU8. What It Means to Man to Be a Pioneer In thought To be a pioneer in thought Is to stand alone with nature, not for a few minutes, but for life. The isolateness of the few great minds of each generation of men is utterly undreamed of, for want of understanding, by' those about them. Tet think what it is to pass one's days in a thought world where the thinker roams alone; to grapple with problems the very terms of which are beyond ordinary comprehension and the solution appreciated only in years to come; to contemplate in lonely ecstasy, after still lonelier despair, the revelation that comes with months and more of pondering. When some one asked Newton how he came to make his wonderful discoveries he replied, "Simply by always thinking about them." Consider Kepler toiling year after year fruitlessly for some ratio that should link the planet's motions by a general law, calculating assiduously, and putting hypothesis after hypothesis aside as he found it would not work until at last, after almost Inconceivable toll, he hit upon the one that would. As If this loneliness by nature were not enough, It must needs be accentuated by man, for he rises In such cases In chorus to condemn. Consider Darwin, In patient study, testing the working out of natural selection and adding fact to fact, only to have the whole denounced as ridiculously absurd. Think you the denunciations of the master while living are wholly compensated by the plaudits after he Is dead? The loneliness of greatness s the price men make the genius 3av for the Dosthumous renown.? Precival Lowell In Atlantic. An Author's Joke.
