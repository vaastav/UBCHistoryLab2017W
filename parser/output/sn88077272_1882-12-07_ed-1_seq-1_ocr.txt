Thirty odd years ago, says the Chrtt fian Union, a mother living in a New England village wrote to Jacob Abbott; then living in New York City, for coun sel. iAer case was a very common one. She had a son, a bright, active bov, who was fond of play, and was not fond of stud. She did not like to send him, at his tender age, to the village school, which was probably neither bettor nor worse than, the average New England school, in which some good tan always be learned and considerable evil always picked up. She was afraid to undertake the apparently onerous task of teaching him herself. She was afraid to let him spend his time in play with chance com panions upon the street. In this per plexity she wrote to Mr. Jacob Abbott, then perhaps as widely kii"vn a. now, for lie was in the midst of his useful wodf ssa writer and a teacher, an I re ft' the following rcpiy. This reply pas ."ome into the hands ot t tie Vafvaiau Uni n recently, and with this public ac knowledgement to the friend of the Christian Union, and of the mothers, who has sent it to us, we print it here; with such modifications onl as are neces sary to avoid all purely pt.rsonal allu sions. We are glad thus to vld to our editorial utterance this voice from the sacred "NEW YORK, —, 1851. 4My Dear Mrs. : It was not until yesterday tha; I re ceived your letter of the 11th July. I was very glad to hear from you, and 1 wish very much that I could see anil talk with you for an hour or two upon the subject upon which you wrote. In fact it is absolutely necessary that I should have a far more perfect acquaintance with the facts in the case than it is pos sible to communicate in writing in order to be qualified to form an opinion in regard to what is best to be done. "I have a son who is about the same age as yours. He is under the charge of his aunt. My instructions to her are and have been for some years that she should confine her pupil for two hours each day to some solitary study of a nature not agreeable, to accustom him to patient, independent effort in the ful fillment of a task. The remainder of the day he has for play, but is to be kept out of the streets. These rules are plain and simple, and they are not onerous, and they are to be uniformly and inflex ibly enforced. The plan seems to answer well. The studies of the boy are reading, writing and simple arithmetic; and in all of them he seems to me to be in advance of other boys of his age, who spend six hours in school daily. "Were I in your case, I should, unless there were in my physical health some absolute and inexorable difficulty inca pacitating me from it, pursue the same course. I should at nine o'clock every morning give my boy some plain, simple and straightforward work, of reading aloud, writing, or "doing sums" enough to last him two hours, and gently but firmly insist on his doing it every day. The remainder of the day I should let him have for play, being with him as much as possible, and taking an interest ,n oil his T in all his plans and pmmrtsr- I should r nim oVJt of he sffSer's and 1 should make him obey me and submit his will implicitly to mine. 1 have great confi dence that such a course as this steadily and firmly pursued will end in making a good boy or any subject whatever. "If my health were such that a plan like this were out of the question I should consider the school the next best plan, unless the "street" influences of are very different from those of most other places. I do not consider your boy's love of play and dislike to study anything tin favorable. His taste in these respects is an evidence of health, and his open avowal of them a sign of his frankness and honesty. I tell my boy that he need not trouble himself about trying to like study; if he will only like play that is all I ask of him. 1 will see that he does all the necessary study without liking it but if he should show any symptoms of not liking play I should at once be alarmed arsl send for the doctor.

"Fortheland'ssake! but what is that!" she exclaimed as she rose up on end. The howls continuing, she got out of bed, raised the window, and called out: "In the name of mercy, what is want ed and who are you?' I'm a Free Citizen," was the reply "But why those howls?" "I'm singing. Fact is, I'm serena ding you." "But I don't want it. Go away or I'll Injure you for life!" But the man refused to move a foot. Hair-brushes, bootjacks, water pitchers and bed steads were heaved at him in quick succession, but he dodged each missile and continued to sing until the Cat cut her throat in desperation. Moral: Turn about is fair play, and the chance is sure to come. Detroit Tree Press. A case of interest, as showing the strength of tradition among the Jew., is that one of the race on Long Island, wto has succeeded, after a long struggle, a lawsuit and the intervention of con stables, in placing a stone over his wife's grave with her portrait carved thereon.

"Don't mnnkey with the buzz-saw while in iuoshun" was the legeh 1 on a rough board nailed to a tree" just in front of a modest saw-mill near the President's birthplace, in Vermont. I don't believe he ever saw it; If he did he was not satistie i. He wanted to go a step further. He wanted to see wheth er he could not "munkey" without get ting hurt. He probably realizes now that ho can not. How they went down, thesi bosses, one after another, before the despised masses who have hereto fore worn their collars meekly and Bveil contentedly, as though in "the bond of peace!" It means so much, that rout, that we can i.ot grasp it all in a mo mont. Democratic Assemblymen; Dem ocratx Mayors; Democratic Governors; DOmocratic Representatives; Democratic Senators; a Doniocraic President in 1884; more Democratic Presidents in the years to come; Civil-servica Reform; revenue reform these results crowd fast one upon the heels of the other un til we can not contain them. But ican ail be summed up in a word. The1 slaves revolted; they rebelled against tneir masters; they were successful; therefore it was a revolution. That is what it means. The people got tired of the bosses. The great National buzz saw of popular indignation began to re volve. The bosses did not Understand It, It had been so quiet for a time. They began to think that it would only revolve when they pleased that it should. Now it is actually going round and round. Still they do not appreci ate the situation. It goes faster and faster, and keen ears detect the first buzz. But the bosses have fat ears. dulled by rich living, and they do not near. J heir eyes stand out wttn lat ness, and they do not see. Faster and faster goes the saw, and the buzz sounds louaer and louder, out still these iatu- ous fools trifle with it. Why, they can stop it in an instant if they will! They nave but to put out their hands. Let them do so. Ah! how swiftly, silently, certainly the gleaming circle Cuts through these hands, i ingers and blood, blood and fingers, ana the floor is drenched with the thick red gore. Per haps it will teach them a lesson. Per haps not. Who cares? It will teach the people, at ahv rate, what their power is. That's the main thing. Bosses can be dispensed with. Perhaps it would be better for the people if they were, home years ago a Western boss a corduroy-trousers-tucked-in-his-cow-hide-boots boss (not so dangerous as vour rvhrfiinied-Princfi-Albert-fronk-fioat boss of the East, with a primrose in his uut ton hole , threw the boots aforesaid upon the stove in the Tillage groggery and remarked to his followers in his own sweet wav. with many soul-stirring oaths: "If I should nut uo a valler dorg with a stumi) tail you'd vote for him." That was true then, in the days when some partisan or other volunteered to vote for the devil himself if the "party" nominated him. It is not so generally true now. It is not so true, for exam- to-day as it was the day before elec-1 tion. After a few more revolutiofls of the buzz-saw in politic it-will -ba true i T J . . . 1 , nSShSjand. oi. no man or hody men. Jt ne .viuencau people, w in cnar- acteristic charity, patience, forbearance, good nature, and what not, have stood more from the picayune politicians who have undertaken to boss politics than would have been borne without a revo lution by any other Nation. They have allowed the bosses to have their own w ay. They have unselfishly ' 'given up' ' every time; they have cried over the bloody shirt; they have shivered under the tari'i' scare; they have danced when the bosses piped, wept when they wept, and whenever Simon (who may stand for the generic boss) has said 'wig-wag" their supple lingers have obediently wiggled. That is all over. Of course the millennium hasn't arrived, and of course the bosses aren't dead. Perfect peace will only come when all factions are sitting quietly side by side on the coffins of the bosses. There will be struggles, bitter contests, sharp lights; sometimes the bosses will be on top; sometimes the people. Bnt the significant fact is that the buzz-saw is "in moshun." Washington Cor.

Long continuance in power made the leaders 1 old and the s stem grew apace, until within a year or two it has assumed enormous proportions. Like a great octopus it stretched out its long, hid eous arms in every direction and to the limits of the country. The system be came an inherent and most important part of the policy of the Republican pariy. The party found itself un able" to retain ower without con trol of the offices. Presently the people who had been lulled into a feeling of security by the specious promises of the Republican party were awakened to a sense of their peril. They l eheld instance after instance of the suffering caused by the corrupt and cruel system. Their eyes were opened to the dangers of an ollice-holding aris tocracy arising in the land. They saw the peril to their institut'ons which arose from the continued dominancy of a party which sustained itsel, by the use ot fabulous sums of money and by open methods of corruption. They knew at last thatthe time had come for action ami the note of warning was sounded. But the Republican leaders refused to heed it. Thev stuck more closely to liubbellism and once more impudently attempted to hnv t hem-selves into the peoplo's favor. It was too late. Armed with the ballot the people made arand eharo-e alone- the whole line. At one fell swoon liubbellism was vannuished and with it the Republican nartv went down. The leaders in this chare-'e were the newspapers of the country gener ally, irrespective of party, although the Democratic press was liercest in its as saults. ; It was the newspapers that awakened the people from the'r leth argy by exposing the evils and dangers of the "system.

Our Opportunity. i I ! j honest use of the moneys of the peo ple, pie, and not the use of that money in TanHarborTO!.'' The secohTiTiity of the i j The tidal wave which has swept so cleanly over the country has furnished the Democrats not only with a comvlete victory, but liaa also given them an op portunity such as they have never had before in the history of the two great political parties. The victory is to be received with such manifestations of joy and satisfaction as may seem proper, but the opportunity is to be studied carefully and viewed in all its Various phases. It is evident that the people o the country are through with the corrupt Republican organization and are dis- f listed with Its political aepraviiy ami eceit- They look 1 1 the Democratic par tv. the Dartv of and for the people, in the future. In "other words the opportunity is sriven the Democratic party to respect the confidence plat ed in it by the great mass of voters, and increase it by wise legislation and honest administration. For the) next two years the victorious cartv will be on probation. Its course in Congress, where its majority is over whelming, will be closely watched and Criticised, in view of the Presidential election in 1884- The young men raised to positions of p-favitv and honor in their several States will also be close ly watched in view of material for the National Convention to be held two years hence. In fact the Democratic party as it stands to-day has every op portunity to so conduct itself, in the interests of good government and the people, that in 1884 the voters of this country will say, "Well done, good and faithful servants." The Republican party,- fussy as it has been, of recent years, in plotting and hatching schemes ot extreme danger to ine institu tions of a free government, has re ceived a death' blow which only worse legislation on the part of the Demo crats can condone. This blow cannot purify the party in two years, and it re mains only for the Democratic party to prove to the country its ability to guide tne course oi puonc auairs in me iuii ests of the many and not in the inter ests of the few. This is the opportun ity the people have given the party aud if it does hot improve it and win the next Presidential fight it will be no o-e's fault but its own. The voters have thus backed the Democratic party that it mav carry out those reforms which the Republican party have either flatly re'used to do, or have purposely delayed action in regard to. There is a meaning to this victory that is as plain as the incompetency of the Re- Sublican party.

The first principle is the secret of success i in a Republic like ours and was care- fullv and honestly fostered by the glorious ancestors of the Democratic i party.

Abolish a system ; of internal revenue which plays into the hands of a coterie of monopolists and oppresses or drives out of the held of competition the small, struggling manufacturer. The match tax is an example of this. By this infernal system of revenue taxation the small manufacturer of matches is unable to carry on his business with any profit to himself. He must either struggle as be-t he may or else sell out to the big manufacturer his machinery as well as ambition The internal revenue sys tem fosters monopolies and poisons small manufactures by its unjust taxa tion. In addition it keeps alive an army of olice-holding spies who draw annually from the lreasurv over so , 000.000 The third duty of the Demo cratic party is to reduce a war tariff to a tariff suitable to times of peace, not to a free trade basis, but sufficient to nrovide for the wants of an honest and economical Administration. Lastly, let the Democratic party see to it that it de nounces and defeats all subsidies, jobs and steals. Let it watch the Adminis t ration and its employes and see that thev do their duty. "As for itself, in Congress, if it tends to the above mat ters, its course will be honest, econom icai, logical , rf all nlaoDlie ical, logical and worthy of the respect This, then is the Democratic oppor tunity, and it is a gre t one.

A little more than one month ago the death-knell of arrogant misrule sounded in Ohio, and on the 7th of ovember followed a funeral d'rge of far more im nos na- proportions. Not one or two States alone participated in the solemn proceeding, but the whole big country with amazing unanimity. But there is more iov than sorrow at the linal de mise of the Republican party, and the feeling of glad relief which generally prevails finds voice in the popular ver dict: "Well rid of it" Henceforth it will be only in sweet memory that the canting saints of the party w.ll De asso ciated with the monumental fraud ot New Jersey as smiling partners in a big steal like the River and Harbor bill. It will be only in tones of warning that Keifer will be mentioned as Sneaker of a National Assembly, and only in the black book history will be discovered the shameful record of a ma orit' usurping the seats of othe members fairly elected thereto.
