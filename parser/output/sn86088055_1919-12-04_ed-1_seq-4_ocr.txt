W.S.HART Washington, Dec. 2 General recommendations on the cost of liv ing, labor unrest, radicalism ami re adjustment of the nation to a peace t'asis were the features of President Wilson's annual message to congress del'vered today. 'I he peace treaty, the president told congress, will be discussed in a separate message alter, as will the railroad question. For the second time only since the president estab lished the practice of addressing I congress in person, his message was j read by the clerks. I The president's principal reeom- mendntions were the establishment of a budget system for national fi 1 nances, reorganization of the taxa ' tion system with simplification of the I income and excess profit taxes; re adjustment of the tariff system to i conform with the fact that the Un ; ited States is the greatest capitalist 1 in the world; recognition and relief 'for veteran soldiers of the world war, I particularly in the way of govern 1 ment farms as proposed by Secretary Lane; proper measures to foster dye stuffs industry built up during the war to keep the United States inde pendent of foreign supply; enlarged i program fur rural development, in recognition of the farmers' part in ' the war. Measures which will "remove the causes of the political restlessness in our body politic." At this point the president made his most extensive reference to the peace treaty by say ing that the causes for unrest ";r, tuperficial rather than deep-seated," ami that thev "arise from or are con nected with the failure on the part .of our government to arnve speedily at a just ami permanent peace per mitting return to normal conditions from transfusion of radical theor ies" from the seething European cen ters, pending such delay, from heart less profiteering, resulting from the increased cost of living, and lastly ' from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators. With re turn to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear. The president renewed his recom mendations for legislation to deal effectively with "those persons who by violent methods will abrogate our, time-tested institutions." Several recommendations and some renewals of previous ones were made by the president to bring down the cost of living. Among them were extension of the food control law to peace times for emergency, regula tion for the transpotration of foods in interstate emmerce; a cold storage i law modeled after the law in New FOR
