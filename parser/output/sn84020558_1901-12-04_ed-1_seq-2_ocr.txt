MESSAGE. House. It is interesting throughout, notwith standing its great length. Each of the many subjects touched upon is handled in a style which holds the attention of the reader to the close. Naturally, after a touching tribute to the memory of President MeKinley, the president takes up the question of dealing with anarchy, and his vigor ous language and wise recommenda tions will have the commendation of every good citizen. The need of a powerful navy is pointed out, and the president argues sensibly that the surest means of main taining peace is through showing that the nation at all times Is prepared to protect the rights of its citizens. No foreign power can take exception to t::e programme announced,' for Met Roose velt leaves no room for doubting that the foreign policy of the United States is one of peace and friendship with all the world. The country will uphold the purpose of the president to strengthen the morale of the army by making it known that promotions are to b strictly for merit. ! The re-enactment of the Chinese ex- I elusion law is forcefully recommended, and in this the president shows that he is In close sympathy with Ameri can sentiment. -As a- matter of course he commends the excellent workings of the gold standard. Strong ground is taken in favor of the Nicaragua canal, and also the Pacific ca bio. On all the topics treated, in short, the president not only takes a position of broad Americanism and unexcep tionable republicanism, but he makes good his promise that he would close ly follow the policies of President Mc Kir.Iey. Nothing else was expected. Perhaps the country generally has awaited with most interest Mr. Roose velt' expressions on trusts and reci procity, and here again It is seen that while discussing these subjects In his own style and from a standpoint of! strong personal convictions, he has in no wise departed from the doctrines laid down by AleKinloy, and by himself in his great speech at Minneapolis- in September. Altogether, the mcsage is an excep tionally able and candid paper, and will be so pronounced by all unbiased crit ics; Throughout, while expressing in the frank and straightforward Roose velt fashion the views of the chief magistrate, it is pitched in a tone of conservatism such as was expected by those who know the president best. Perhaps no subject discussed by the message will be read with greater in tere?t in the west than the portion which deals with the conservation of the flood waters and the reclamation of the arid lands. It was already known, to be sure, that the president's accure knowledge of western conditions und his strong friendship for western people would make his advocacy of a liberal national policy a certainty, but his specific recommendations have been awaited with conpMerable iur ioaityi Hern ateo, hp is wisely con servative. After rutnn iig up the Pil uation in the arid regions, his recom mendations In brief are. that the gov ernment should proceed slowly and carefully In working out a policy of na tional irrigation, with an eye single to the reclamation of the Ianda now vacant, for the benefit of bone fide home-seekers, and he suggests that "ultimaaely it will probably bo neces sary for the nation to co-operate with the several arid Ftates in proportion as there states by their leg;a!tion and administration show them-elves fU to receive it." If congress derides to extend the aid of the nation In th" rc lamination of the arid I;imlt. Arizona will probably h- ejii'.ng the first benefited, as the xev for the Indians on the Pima reserva tion, but would furnish a supply for many thousands of acres now lying vacant in the middle Gila valley. Tak ing It for granted, however, that con gress may accept the views and recom mendations of the president, there in still nothing in the policy announced which promises any direct benefit to the Salt River valley. Indeed, should nothirg be done locally, and should congress at some time in the future favorably consider the construction of a reservoir on the Salt River, It would more than likely prove a detriment to the interests of the present ranch own ers, as lurga areas out3ide the present canal limits would have to be included in the proposition beforehand in order to gain any considerable strength for it at Washington. migration directs attention to the weak place In our barrier and shows con gress how to strengthen it. In his second paper on "The Settle ment of the West,", in the December Century, Emerson Hough gives some details regarding southwestern wagon trains. The story of the Santa Fe trail has been told by many writers, and its chief interst here is simply as showing the eagerness with which the men of that day seized upon every meuns of transport In their power. ,and the nkiH and ingenuity with which they brought each to perfection. This wagon freight ing of the southwest was highly sys tematized, and was Indeed carried on with almor.t military regularity. The route was by way of the Council Grove, then the northern limit of the Coman ches' range, and It was at this point that the organization of the wagon train was commonly completed. A train master or captain was chosoi; and the whole party put under his com mand, each man having his position, and each being expected to takes his turn on the night watch which was necessary in that land of bold and hos tile savages. During the day the train moved in two columns, some thirty feet apart, each team following clore ; upon the one immediately preceding It in the line. In case of any alarm of Indians, the head and rear teams of the two parallel columns turned in toward each other, and thus there was formeJ upon the moment a long parallelogram f wagons, open in the middle, and in closing the loose riding animals, and closed at the front and rear. The wagons were loaded, to a great extent, with cotton stuffs In bales, and these made a fair fortification. The-Indians had tSiIicuIty in breaking the barricade of one of the hardy caravars, defended as it was by numbers of the best rifle men the world ever knew. Small parties were frequently destroyed, but in th? earlier days a train was commonly made up of at least luo wagons with perhaps 00 men in the party, and with &') mules or oxen. The goods in con voy in such a train might be worth half a million dollars. The time i.i transit was about ten weeks, the out trip being made in the spring and the return in the fall. Twenty years ago Jules Vern wrot a stpry entitled "Twenty Thousand Leagues TTnder the Sea." In is a ship runs under the sea, being con t rolled at will by electrical apparatus. It was held to be a wild Might of the Imag ination, but now Verne is dyln i'i poverty and obscurity in Paris, while the new submarine boat, the Fulton, in performing all that he predicted, be ing able to stay on the bottom of j the sea at will and rise to th top (whenever lis pleases. It Is remark able that the imaginative feats that Verne set forth In his works twenty years ago have nearly all been achiev ed in the present, which is another Il lustration of the fact that truth stranger than fiction. Montague Whie. lute consul genera! in London, wan given a reception ti Chicago the other night. Among the speakers was Judge Marcus Kavanagh. He was introduced as a man who had swayed thousands with his oratory. He began pompously enough. "Jn the word3 of the great Napoleon, 'One with God, is a majority: " . "Hold on!" cried Rev. Mangasarian, who was present, "Frederick Douglas; said that." "Did he?" asked the judge, "I thought it was Napoleon," but the interruption had floored the speaker, and he was obliged to sit down with his burning thoughts all unexpressed. Cuesta S3ey C- Co.

M'KINLEY AND THE UKI'OIITKU The campaign for the presidency of the new republic of Cuba is progres sing toward a stage where our Ii tin American wards are beginning to dis play an excitement natural to thoir temperament. It must have been emo tion rather than cool Judgment that moved the leader of o ne of the fac tions supporting Masii to send a teic pram to I'resident Koosevelt asking him, in effect, to h-ve the members of our present military government in Cuba preserve neutrality. Any observer of our administration in the islapd knows that its absolute impartiality has been most conspicuously displayed in tile munic.pal elections. There will be no departure from this Impartiality during the presidential election. It will be the duty of our officers there to see to it that the election Is orderly and honest. That will be the extent of tht-ir function. Palma, who has the supiKrl of Maximo Gomez, represents the con servative element, and his election would mean, probably, the observance in good faith of the conditions pre scribed by the so-called Piatt amend ment to the constitution. The candi dacy of Masso represents the reaction ary element. It is said that Palma favors annexation; but the election of Masso might have the effect of hasten ing annexation, through the desire of a people anxious to be saved from themselves.

L1TEIIAKT BOSTON. rctary of the interior has strongly rec- If the Mexican government grants the concession asked for by the at torney for the Chinese counsel at Sjvn Francisco and his associates, it will be necessary for the I'nilcd States to es tablish a continuous chain of patroej along lh Mexican border and coast guard r.tatlotis on the shores of south ern California. It is the avowed pur pose of the applicants to run steam ships between Mexico and China and colonize the state of Sonora with a mil lion coolies. Their ability to carry out thi plan is dmihtful, hut it Is uit certain that any large number of Chi nese imported, to Sonora would be a constant menace to American labor, because they would drift over the line in preference to remaining in Mexico. Most of the Chinese who have entered the United States in violation of law have ehme by way of Mexico and Tirit ish Columbia, crossiir.g the line surrep titiously and often with connivance of officials especially charged with the l'ty of Uw-i ing them out. The chief defect of the exclusion laws is the insufficiency of means provided for rn-fv:'--cment and for eitardlng the land Those were the days when, says Mr. Howells, "Literature in iioston v.-.is so respectable anil often of so high a line age that to be a. poet was not only to be good so iety. but almost to be go;:d family." As poet and essayist iJr. Holmes, "the last leaf upon the tree." wrote of the Unymn which he knew and loved with a deeper sens of kin- rhip and affection than any of his con temporaries. i:ut th-- sene;i of his Action ate. with one exception away irom the city which by Jiim was first dubbed "the Hub." This exception was "The Guardian Angel." In spite of all the novelists have h id to say about Hoston. no one of them. vith all due respect to Mr. llowelis. las yet presented it in its entirety. He, the dominant writer of Hot-ton fiction, saturating his pages with its business, social and intellectual atmos phere, personifies varied types which, photographic as they ore, fail to pre sent certali phases of the genuine Boatonese. This may be because of his tendency to present "a nostonian, not the Itostonian," which was r. Holmes' way of putting it in referring to one of his characters.
