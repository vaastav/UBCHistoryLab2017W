The Ketchum Keystone. The Salt Lake Tribune in an ed itorial of a recent issue, speaking of Idaho's chances for Statehood, says: With more than 100,000 people de manding admittance into the Union, with euch resources in their hands, with more than 100,000 people who are real A.neri cans, there is no congress that will denv .heir' prayer. The V^ntatioa of .he fair possibilities of the territory will act as a double argument for admission, be cause, first, the showing will make it clear that the territory is amply able to sup port statehood, and second, the showing SÄZCS to have the full power to control their nwn affairs, and not to be hampered by the divided and uncertain rule that i9 ex tended to territories. We believe that "rder f ^,«'wè°l.svs .ÄEÜ u'm"* offered by way of suggestion, as is also the further belief that they should, either by popular subscription or by legislative appropriation, raise a little fund for the purpose of collecting data necessary to ion heat [on^for^s t atdi nod ""such 2ÄSn. with maps and drawings, will have their effect. When the Tribune makes the strong assertion that, "with more than 100,000 people demanding ad mittance into the Union, with such resources in their hands, with more than 100,000 people who are real American citizens, there is no con gress that will deny their prayer," we apprehend that that journal did not intend to include the 1500 peo pie composing the population of Paris, Bear Lake county. The peo pie on whose account the Tribune in its issue of Dec. 1st so unjustly criticised Governor Stevenson for alluding to them in a befitting man nerin his report to the Secretary of the Interior. Moreover we presume tho Tribune in alluding to the prayer for admission, does not in tend to include among the 100,000 real American citizens the people of three other counties of the ter ritory. But why not include them, so long as they are willing to obey the laws of the land, no matter what religious belief they entertain? Governor Stevenson's late report is in itself an able and comprehen sive data of the condition and state j of affairs in every portion of the territory, and the only fault the ir 11 ™ 116 can find with it is because the Governor refers kindly and truthfully to the industrious habits and prosperous condition of a cer- j tarn class of people m a portion ofj the terntorv. I or this the Tribune wantonly assails his report. is The people of Idaho feel an amused surprise that such an ably j j tea paper as the Tribune should ! ad vane et he idea that "this report ! con rms the belief that there was ; an all-embracing conspiracy to give | to Idaho statehood in which the j saints were to hold the balance ofj power.

Delegate Dubois, in a private let ter, says tli8 îveivs-Miner, "has ex pressed the opinion that democratic appointees will hold their offices until tbe expiration of their terms, unless removed for cause, and that ho can not consistently urge any claims for positions until such piration or removal." Undoubted ly office-seekers are getting anxious and are already making demands °n Delegate Dubois for recommen dation for appointments, hence the writing of the "private" letter.

[Special to the Keystone.] Washington, Dec. 8 1888. The second session of the Fiftieth ed- Congress opened on the 3d of De cember with a very good attendance of the members in both houses, though many prominent Senators de- were conspicuous by their absence. with The galleries were crowded to over more flowing. The gay costumes of the many eocie ty women prese nt made denv .. ■, .he the scene a brilliant one. While act ? n lbe fl° or J the man y floral offer be- ings heaped upon the desks made clear that part of the building vie with sup the galleries in color. Tbe reading of the President's Message occupied an hour and their three-quarters, and was listened to by with the usual grave dignity, and ex no demonstration was made over it. that The democrats are greatly pleased " ith te "° r ' while the republicans also as a r ule have ve, T few opinions to express, though some of them se verely criticise some portions of it. the One eminent republican Senator to c ] a i ms that it was unpardonably unpatriotic for the chief executive of the United States to suggest to the citizens of this republic and to foreign nations that u our survival the for one hundred years is not suffi cient to assure us that we no ad- longer have dangers to fear in the maintenance, with all its promised j blessings, of a government founded ! upon the freedom of the people," 1 or that it is time for American citi- j zens to inquire "whether we have before us a way plain and clear which leads to happiness and per- ! of petuity." This same Senator de dares that the passage in which he intimates that the present great prosperity of this republic is the direct result of "the communism of combined wealth and capital," and of that protection "makes the boast of free institutions a glittering de lusion, and the pretended boon of American citizenship a shameless imposition," might have been writ ten by Dennis Kearney or Johann Most, while some of the democrats j point to these same passages with hearty approval as indicating that President Cleveland retains to the ! * last the leadership of his party ; I that be still foreshadows its policy j and identifies himself in this mes- 1 j sage not only with the reform of the tariff but with the irrepressible conflict with predatory corpora tions that is to play so mighty a'uel part in molding our history. ! The republicans say the message ; j read like a chapter from the "Cave ofj of Gloom," while the democrats have but one opinion about it. That j is one of exultation. They say that I their leader, though defeated, still J j carries aloft the banner of tariff re- ! ! form, and that they will stand or j ! fall by it again. "The cause," they | ; say with the President, "is the peo | pies cause. It should never be j compromised." There are some passages in the message which republican leaders say will be made the text for some sharp criticisms of the President j V6 7 „ In the Senate the desks had a j fresh coat of varnish and the carpet ! ' had been taken up and beaten and : a everything looked fresh and bright. Flowers were placed on the desk of j the presiding officer, and baskets | ! and bouquets marked the desks of! many of the Senators. Curiously ! enough, however, these florai offer î n 8 s were all to democrats, observ m ê wbl J T h one republican Senator said : îsever mind, we do not need them, we are not dead. ' In the House it was the same, to a great extent, the flowers were for the in democrats, although General Hovey the republican Governor-elect o"f Indiana, received a huge floral 1 * 0 T. sh0< ; frora hls Hoosier friends m a 118 C j iy \ j A card attached to an immense b: siet of pink and white roses, fur ubarly hid Archie Bliss of Br ° 0 ^ 1 > ,n qf^ om view, bore the in scnption, "To the man who has the C0 2,r a S e of his convictions." Tim Campbell, of the Eighth Nevv York district, also received a 1 handsome basket of roses, the gift of the compositors at the Govern- of ment printing office. Mr. Campbell was so highly pleased with the graceful remembrance of his fel- the low-craftsmen that he called every b °dy 8 attention to it. 'W hat do you think of that, my hearty?^ said Mr. Campbell, point j tne R®w er3 an d addressing ^urî 0 ' Ne 'j T of "I think," said Mr. McAdoo, with cruel sarcasm, "that you have more roses here than you had votes at ^ i e T.i as * j ec , tlon .' .

HOUSE The da 3 r was somewhat more lively than in »ho Senat. The members to were a good deal like school boys h e f° re the gavel fell, and indulged it. tn a good deal of hand-shaking and q uiet joking among themselves. j^ ri( "'P ublican8 Wer<! eepecially to hilarious. Conspicuous among the ladies in the President's seat was the beauti first lady of the land, Mrs. Cleveland. She was accompan jed by Mrs. Folsom and escorted to «V Col. John M. Wilson, of the to arm >- Ai rs. Cleveland s lovely face wore no snadow of care or disap pointment. She was at tired in one °f her new walking dresses, a pretty and becoming tailor-made gown of j brown camel s hair cloth. The ! g race ful jacket was lined with pale 1 1 yellow silk, a striking bit of color, j as ^ be fronts flapped back and dis Played the dainty arrangement of the vest, held at the throat by large ! gold-headed pins. An Alpine hat °f brown felt completed her cos tume. ^ little to the left, in the front row . tbe diplomatic gallery, sat *^ rs - Hitt, the wife of the Illinois Representative. Mrs. Hitt is a ra diant beauty, and in loveliness and popularity is scarcely les3 distin gobbed than Mrs. Cleveland. ^ Mrs. Carlisle was in the speaker's seat in the gallery, which place she has occupied at the opening of every j Congress for the last twelve years. The clear-toned notes of the clerk j as he read thelongroll weredrowned j ! * n *he vast buzz of human voices. I Members did not observe the rules j or . care * or them, but continued 1 beir congratulations and condo lences. Shortly before the gavel fell, Sam a'uel J. Randall, pale and haggard ! from his long illness, and with a ; look of suffering on his face en- ! tered the chamber. His appear- j ance contradicted the declaration j of his physician that he was fast I I regaining his health. He has lost I J greatly in weight, and his complex-1 ! ion is dull and pallid. As he sank ! j languidly into the seat be has occu | pied for "nearly a quarter of a cen tury, a score of hands were out stretched in greeting. To the anx- ! ious inquiries of his friends,^Mr I Randall replied that he was much | better, and hoped that with care he I should be able to go through the!™». j session. From the time he entered until he left his desk was surround- j ed with visitors, ! ' Speaker*'Carlisle also came in for j : a liberal share of attention Tom Reed of Maine Burrows! Brecynridge, the sSvW tongued | Kentuckian ; Mills, of tariff fame • Springer, of Illinois, with his dainty button-hole bouquet: "Sunset" Cox, the wit of the House, and score or more of others equally well known and liked here, stood in groups, laughing, chatting, congrat ulating and consulting their dates, according to the condition in which the fortune of politics had left them At precisely 12 o'clock the gavel fell and stilled the tumult that ex isted in the hall, and all wore silent while the chaplain prayed. After roll call the House took fur an hour. After recess the President's Mes gage was delivered to the House and read by the clerk. That portion of the message in which the President treats of the tariff question was listened to at tentively by members on both sides of the House. The silence was not broken until the clerk read in a clear voice, "The cause for which the battle is waged is comprised within lines clearly and distinctly defined, and it should never be compromised." Then the demo crats could no longer restrain their feelings, and broke out into a round of applause, which the republicans answered by laughter. From this point the interest slack ened. Mills, of Texas, was the only member who listened to the further reading, and the noise of converse tion was so great that this was no easy task. xfl e democrats in the House pro pose to make the admission of the territories into the Union their first care at this session. Mr. Springer will advocate the admission of all the territories at once, according to the provisions of the bill which he reported from the Committee Territories last winter. This bill admits the whole of Dakota state. of the territory and admitting it 'wo state». This plan will be dis cussed in the caucus and may he ado P ted if * he real interests o7the I^°P le of Dakota seem to require it.
