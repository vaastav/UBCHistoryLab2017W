The “information of the stale of the Union." which the Const! tnlion pi - ' Q et ihes, is vc rv complete. lie admonishes Congnss to exercise economy, but nnfoilnnately at the S ime time he urgent ly ncommends the passage of the Shi]> Subsidy bill. This scheme seems to many an extravagant use of the public funds and is, inorc ever. a diversion those binds from public ends to private advantage. -Most of the topics discussed in the message are familiar to the public. The Philippines, of course, are to be iv’ained and Congress!, nai action up on the qmstion of their government is m cessary at once. I he President asks for authority du ring the present conditions in Cuba and the Philippines to maintain the standing army ol 100,000 men. It is greatly to be hoped, however, that these conditions will not continue much longer. The message is in every respect characteristic of its author. The coun try will be fortunate if Congress and the politicians can be infused with some of his spirit of moderation. 

PRESIDENT IA L ELECTORS. Ihe Legislature ol .Maryland in 18CC, says the Baltimore “Sun,” made a curious oversight, in fixing the meet ing of the Electoral College for the election of President and Vice-Presi dent of the United Stall s on the tirst Wednesday in December. That was the day named by the Congress pass ed in 1845. it was eh: n cd to the second Monday in January by li.c act of Congress approved February .->, ISS7, and, of course, in this matter the net of Congress prevails over a Stale law. The Legislature in IB9C in en acting llie election law should have fixed Hie same day for the meeting of the Electoral College as that d sig naled hy Congress. Their failure to do so, however, has done no harm ex cept to cause some confusion an ’ un certainty among persons who do not have the acts of Congress in tie it li hrarii g. 1 lie act of 1887 prescribes the en tire proceeding for the ascertainment and declaration of the result of the meetings of the Electoral Colleges and also for the settlement of disputes in the returns such as occurred in Hie election of 187(5. As soon as the vote ol a State is ascertained in the manner prescribed by the laws ol the State the Governor must communicate to the Secretary of State of the United Stales “a certificate of such ascertainment of the electors appointed” and the same certificate in duplicate to the electors before the day of their meeting. These certificates are to be si ul bv the elec tors to the Sviiitaiy of Stale at M ashinglon along with the list of per sons voted for for President and Vice- Prcsid nt. It is the duty of the Sec- i rotary of State of the United States as soon ;.s pi act cable alter the receipt ol the certificates to publish them in full in a newspaper and at the first meet mg of Congress thereafter he shall tiansmit to the two houses copies of the certificates. < ongress is required to be in session on the second Wednesday in February succeeding every meeting of the elec tors. Both houses of Congress au- to meet in the 1 all of the House of Hi p resentativis at 1 o’clock J’. M. that day and the President of the Senate presides and announces the vote as the eeilifn-ati s are handed to him. 

HANNA’S GREAT JOB. “Preparations are making,” avs the Boston /W, “to railroad the ship bounty bill llirongli Congress at this session. Possibly Hanna mignt have forced it last winter if it was worth while, but that astute political maiia S er saw. what every cm* ulso saw, that the ( nactnieut of such a notorious j*ii would have been a millstone about, the neck of the Republican candidate lor 1 resident in the approaching cam paign, and he let it go (or a more propitious lime. That time, in Hanna's opinion, has now arrived. He is safe in control lor four years more of Mc- Kinley, and it does not matter what people may say or what protest may he made.” - I Governor Smith of Mary land, was ( the first Governor to forward the certificate of the electoral vote ol a State at the late national election- It was sent to Secretary Hay. who forwarded it to President ( r . tem o( the Senate Fry Wednesday. ( President McKinley assmed a dele gation of \ irginia Congre-smi n that he is opposed to reducing Southern j representation. 

LONDON PRESS VIEWS. t London comment upon President Mc- Kinlev’s message to Congress is chiefly ; devoted to the references to America’s Chinese policy. The Daily Graphic says: “The policy of the United States regard ing China is not heroic, but it is certainly ( practical, and there is ample reason to he e lieve that it will prevail." The Times says: •“ “The message makes it clear that on the a vital point of insisting upon punishment I,’ for the outrages Mr. McKinley rt mains * firm. We are glad to sec that on the sub . jeet of guarantees for Christian converts I the President makes a new proposal in ad ■ vance of any put forward elsewhere. In e regard to the indemnity question he is in agreement with some of the best opinion in England.” The Times' editorial concludes with the expression of a hope that Mr. McKinley's ■ second term mav be mai ked by- a “satis- I factory settlement of all outstanding ques > lions between Great Britain and America.” i The Daily News says: “The message contains nothing new and nothing very illuminating on matters that arc old. It will lie very closely scanned for its references to China. It looks as ‘ though the American formula were that i the powers aie to specify the culprits and the Chinese Government is to specify the punisl :rei:l. On such terms a speedy set tlement would undoubtedly be possible, but would it be effective or durable?” The Standard, which agrees with tlie ' Times in thinking that if all the powers had withdrawn after the legations were , relieved to the same extent as the United States, there would not now he much chance of obtaining satisfaclion, remarks: “The excessive anxiety to it- establish trade with China is perhaps the real ex ■ planatiou of some points that have not seemed satisfactory in the recent policy of I the United States.” In the opinion of the Standard the Wash ington Government has “acted as a drag on European diplomacy.” The Daily Chronicle observes: “Clearly the United States Government is able to boast of an aggregate of imports and exports exceeding $2,000,000,00(1 and to propose a reduction of revenue taxation to the extent of $00,000,000. The Admin istration has a fair justification, even if there be no very obvious need, for further encouraging the American mercantile ma rine.” WAR TAN 

AGAIN < I T, Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Payne, on Wednesday introduced a hill making a total reduction in the war reve nue of $40,000,348. He had the agree ment of the Republican members on the proposition. It contains many new items including a reduction in beer to SI.OO. The present tax is $2 per barrel, with a 74 per cent, rebate to $1.83, so that the reduction will be 23 cents per barrel. The sections taxing commercial brokers, customhouse brokers, circuses, theatres and other exhibitions are striken out. The rate on cigars is made $3 instead of $3.00 per 1.000 Schedule A iclaius the stamp tax on corporate stocks, bonds, etc., sales, etc., at exchanges or boards of trade, freight receipts, certificates of profits, entry of goods at customhouses and entry for withdrawal of g.-ods from customs bond ed warehouses. With these exceptions the stamp taxes under schedule A are stricken out. Chan man Payne’s state ment gives in detail the stamp taxes omitted under schedule A. Schedule B, which required stamps on proprietary medicines and preparations, prefumcry and cosmetics, chewing gum, etc., is amended so that sparkling or other wines arc the only products requir ing stamps. Section 20, relating to taxes on legacies, is amended by adding at the end of said section the following: Provided, That nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to bequests or legacies for uses of a religious, literary, charitable or educational character, in cluding works of art. Section 30 is amended as to administra tive features, and sections 10, 11, 18, 10 and 20 arc repealed, as they relate to ad ministrative features no longer necessary. The bill provides for redeeming reve nue stamps heretofore issued and not used. The concluding section provides that the act shall take effect 30 days after its passage. Rheumatism.

Editou: —The re assemblihg of s Congress fouiul the Capitol full of ugly and sensational minors connected with the Isthmian Canal question. Some of y these rumors make charges entirely too serious to he repeated without pi oof of their truthfulness, as to what has been ac complished by the lobbyists employed by e the Panama Canal Company,in their efforts I to delay Congressional action authorizing p the construction of the Nicaragua Canal. But there are some facts which speak for s themselves. Sometime ago it was an nounced in a semi official manner that lie II report of the Canal Commission would be I strongly in favor of the Nicaragua route; II now it is allowed to become known that the report of the Commission will not c specify a preferable route, but will give s its estimates of the cost of the Canal by ■ the Nicarauga route, and the cost of the • completion of the Panama Canal, together with the terms upon which this govern ment can scenic control of the latter, and 1 leave Congress to decide for itself. What t brought about this change? That is the ■I question that the rumors deal with. The s President of the Panama Cana! Company 1 had a long conference with the Secretary • of Staie, and, of course, everybody knows u what the gentleman is in Washington for. Although the Nicaragua Canal bill, which '* passed the House at the last session, was, by resolution of the Senate, made a special u order for Wednesday of this week, a pro s gram has been arranged by which the Ship K Subsidy bill will be used to side track the ■' Canal bill, unless the program is upset by 1 a majority vote of the Senate. The Pana ma Canal Conij any has caused one great 1 National scandal, which disgraced emi nent Frenchmen, and from present indi t cations it may cause another, that will f disgrace some prominent Ame.icans. Nominally the two branches of Congress - met to-day and adjourned without wait g iug to get Mr. McKinley's message, as a mark of respect to the late Senators Davit and Grear and members of the House who t have died since the last session, but in s reality the adjournment was for the pur -1 pose of giving tin republicans a little i more time to try to reconcile their numer ous differences and to get together on a f legislative program. r The Jackson Democratic Association, -of Washington, is arranging for its annual celebration of Jackson Day, January Mb next, with as much enthusiasm as its members could possibly have displayed had the party been victors in the late cam -1 paign. The Jacksonians arc of the same ' undaunted brand as was “Old Hickory ’ himself, and the result of campaigns cuts no figure in their calculations when coin -3 pared with the principles they value far 5 more than triumph. Representative Shaffroth, of Colorado, 1 said of the contest lor the seat which w ill be vacated March 4th by Senator M olcoli: “It promises to be the most interesting, ’ and the closest call ever known in that - section. Three of the strongest men in the State are now candidates—Gov. ' Thomas former Governor Adams and Thomas F. Patterson, and it is just possi -1 ble that Mr. Charles J. Hughes, a promi -1 nent mining lawyer, may enter the field • as the fourth.” Although all knowledge on the subject is denied at the War Department, many persons in Washington believe the cor ; redness of the story that embalmed beef : Eagan w ill shortly be restored to duty as Commissary General of the army by Mr. McKinley. Ropreseulalive Neville, of Nebraska, who was re elected says he thinks Editor Rosewater has too many republican cue mies to succeed in getting elected to the Sen ate. Notw itstanding his previous humiliating experience in that line, Secretary Root has again smothered an important public document on the ridiculous ground that it is a confidential matter not intended to be made public. The document in question is the report made by an expert a count aut from the Treasury Department who was sent to Cuba at Secretary Root’s re quest to go thoroughly over the accounts of Rathbone and Neeley. The real rea son for not making it public is that it shows the stealings in Cuba to have been greater and more systematic than anybody had supposed. A similar report was made by the accountant to the Senate Committee on Relations w ith Cuba, which has been trying so hard not to comply with the Senate resolution directing it to investi gate Cuban finances. If these reports are not made public, there is likely to be some plain talk in Congress on the right of an official to suppress a report made bv a minor official under orders and under pub lic pay. If such repoits are not public documents, pray what are? A treaty has been signed w ith Nicara gua, giving the L uited States the light to construct and operate the Nicaragua Canal, which w ill be sent to the Senate for ratification, but whether the Panama lobby will allow it to be acted upon only time can tell. A democratic caucus of the House is now in session, to decide upon the party police to be followed in dealing with the army reorganization bill, which the repub licans w ill push at once. Senator Martin, of Virginia, said of the attitude of the democrats toward the leg islation of the session: “I see no reason for any captious objection or dilatory tactics on the part of the democrats, ido not mean that the minority has no respon sibility' but that the democrats w ill be sat isfied w ith a statement of their objections am! with recording their voles against bills they- do not approve.” Till, MIW
