Patrick Walsh has heeu elected Mayor of Augusta, (ia. Hy Lia election the citizens of Augusta hate done <-reilit to themselves, and honored :i worthy citizen. The United States Supreme Court lias sel Mardi 7th as the time for houri nf: the Dispensary ? ase. The Legislature, therefore, will have to tackle thc question blindly. mt ? m Newbold has been admitted to bail in the sum of ??,')(>() hy Judge Town send at I nion. Tin- admitting to bail of men who shoot down innocent per sons is a most dangerous proceeding, and should not he allowed. Ilcprcscntutivc Livingston, ol' Georgia, who is one of the best friends Cuba has in Congress, doesn't think the outlook good for legislation favorable to Cuba. He thinks there will be a lot of talk but no action. Gen. Miles, enmmandej-in-ohief of the United States army, has biokcn loose again and is demanding an in crease of thc army. With a modesty only equalled hy his beauty, (?en. Miles suggests as a starter an increase af about HID per cent, in the armed forces of the United States. rn? . mm The Comptroller General's office linds the total assessed value of the real estate of the State to be *1IU, S7i2,70li this year, which is an increase of about a million dollars over last year's assessment. Thc personal property assessment rose over two million dollars in tbs same time. Charleston will have her usual (?ala Week this fall on a grander scale than ever, lt will begin next Monday and last the entire week. There will bc racing, reel contests, trades display, fantastic parade, shotgun contests, sham hattie, concerts and amuse ments everywhere. The good people of thc grand old city will extend a eordial welcome to all visitors. A call for a convention of cotton growers, to be held in Memphis^ De cember 20, has been issued by Mr. Hector D. Lane, president of the American Cotton ?!rowers' Protective Association. Mr. Lane thinks that the present low price of cotton, which is due in great part to thc enormous crop, demands a concert of action on the part of cotton growers to avert a similar calamity next year. The lirst regular session of the Fifty-fifth Congress convened Monday, and it will probably remain in sos?ion for the nest six or seven months. President McKinley's message was a lengthy oue. Thc currency question and foreign relations are tne chief matters discussed. He recommends inaction as to Cuba and urges the annexation of thc Haiwaian Islands. Thc following ia an extract from a private letter received from a promi nent ex-railroad man whose opinion in railroad affairs is baaed upon years of experience und whose information con cerning the resources of the South is considerably in ad vaneo of most men with whom it is our pleasure to con verse or correspond: "I notice there is a threat on the part of thc owners of thc Charleston and Western Caro Ji?a Railroad to build a new road from Atlanta to Augusta, hut this will not be done. There are already two roads between those-cities, and a third would never pay. It is not more short lines we need in thc S?;uth. but a grand Trunk Line, such as thc proposed Black: Diauioud, coming direct from eentcrs of trade in the west and tra versing the rich mineral resources of the South and Northwest down to thc seaboard, with three grand outlets at Savannah, Charleston and Port Royal, all ef them doing a share of tho new business whieh this great railroad would create, and which would give them something more than cotton, which is now relied upon almost ex clusively for exports because nothing else can be made to pay or to compete with the larger systems to thc more l?stern ports,or by the Illinois Central to N?w Orleans. There is a great deal pending io the important law suit now going on be tween thc Thomas and llyan syndicate and thc L. & N. for the half interest, in thc Georgia lease. It is my im pression that thc L. sSc N. will soon control tho C. & W. C. R. H.-, and in that case they would be better able /and more disposed to connect with the Wei-t, but would probably oppose the Black Diamond as thc L. & N. has im mense interest in the coal and iron re? j?ion.s of thc South and control about 5,(KM) miles of railroad. It is a tery interesting question for us here, for , the I*. Sc N. wants an outlet and we are anxious that her main terminal * should he Port Royal whick offers so i many more advantages than tho two ' otlwr ports. The projfct and plan of i thc Black Diamond Ralina lis n grund ! one, and, if carried out would be of great benefit to the ent re South. It ? would develop its gre? t resource! as nothing else could do, and bring it in to such .cloie proximity to the great West for mutual trade and commerce, which would induce settlers to conic South and improve our waste lands and bring with them some of the Western life and energy which has done so much to astonish the world. Wc mu.il and will have a great rail road from thc South Atlantic like the I'ennsylVuliia system b iding to the West under one control. The Black Diamond lill.? thc bill completely, and ran do more lor us than any other syndicate, either thc L. N. or the Southern I!, ll., both of which are striving to control the destiny ?of the South.'1 .fudge J. S. (oi h ran, of Abbeville, died last Sunday morning in New York, where be bad cone to have a surgical operation performed. His remains were brought to Abbeville and interred yesterday afternoon. Hy his death South Carolina loses another abie and influential citizen, and he will be missed by thc; people of the whole State, whom bc served faithful ly in war and peace. Judge Cothrun was boru in Abbeville County August 8, 1630. In his boyhood he attended the '"old held" schools, then went to Krskinc College for a year, and after ward went to thc University of .Geor gia, from which he graduated in 18.r>2. lie returned to Abbeville, read law and in lKf>4 was admitted to the Har. Ile practiced law until thc breaking out of the war. when he volunteered ns a privatein Co. B., Orr's Regiment. He was finally promoted to Captain of thc company, and during thc war was wounded three times. In ISTti Judge Co th ran was elected Solicitor . if thc IO ?gil th Judicial Circuit, in which position be served until May, 1 SS], when Gov. Ilagood appointed him Judge of thc Sallie Circuit to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of,Judge Thompson. Ile served as Judge for eight years, and upon thc death of Col. D. Wyatt Aiken was elected as his successor to -"Congress, where he was when selected as general counsel for the Southern Railway, in which capacity he served up to thc tillie of his death. In every trust he was faithful and true, aud his mem ory will long be cherished by his legion of friends. utm Fighting Uncle Sam. CoL?illiIA, Dec. C>.-Thc general indications arc that thc dispensary management and thc Administration do not expect any radical change in the dispensary law. The tendency from these sources will be to leave thc law as nearly as it Ftands nt pres ent as possible. There is just at this time no more chance of the passage of a prohibition bill, and by that is meant a dispensary law for medicinal, sacramental and scientific purposes only, than there is for thc passage o? a high license Act. A resolution may be passed to the effect that the intention of thc dispensary law is to regulate thc sale of liquor and strictly not for money making. Such an ex pression may even be incorporated in the new "Administration" bill that is to be proposed to thc General Assem bly, but it will bc more of a blind than anything else, and it will bc noted that there will be no change in the management of the business or thc price of the liquors. To show that the lawmakers do not propose to allow profits to be mado. and that liquor is only to bc sold for medicinal, sacramental and scientific purposes, it would bc as well to fix prices in the law. There are some who argue that if the price of liquors bc doubled that it will have the effect of reducing thc consumption as well as thc profits to the dispensary, while on thc other hand it is argued that when thc State says that it does not propose to make any profit on thc sale ot liquor, it should sell thc goods at aatual cost, plus thc cost of handling. It is now contended, and has all along been so contended, by a certain element of dispensary advocates that thc profit feature was a mere incident of the law. The reports for the month of Octo ber indicate that there has been a considerable falling off in the sales through the dispensary, although for the last few days there has been an increase in thc business, supposedly on account of the Christmas trade.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 30.-A special to the ?ge-Herald from Ma plesville, Ala., says: Seven men are dead and seventeen more arc not ex pected to live from thc result of drink ing a mixture of wood alcohol and cheap whiskey.
