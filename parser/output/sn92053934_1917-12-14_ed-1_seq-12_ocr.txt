Dealers said today j there Is less than 80 tons of coal on hand to supply the retail trade, and orders now on file call for many times that amount of fuel. Of the seven local dealers in East Moline, four of tho largest report tlint their coal stock Is entirely exhausted. Before Suiidav, unless unexpected relief comes, the community will ex perience serious buffering, according to the prediction of dealers. This morning one of the dealers offered the suggestion that residents of the com munity eonserve the fuel supply to the greatest extent possible. Those who ure operating several stoves are ad vised to cut out all but one. Never has the sli nation hero been more seri ous, the dealers say, and they warn consumers that it may be days be fore the supply is replenished. Appeal is to be made to the state fuel administration. But with the railway congestion always resulting from severe cold weather, the trans portation problem is the most serious, and the coal men say the outlook Is gloomy indeed. Wateriown hospital's coal famine is over for the time being, though early iu the week It was very serious again. Several cars of coal were procured in East Moline and hi:.uled to the hos pital liy teams and today another car v arrived and word came from the fuel agent, Mr. Fenelon of Galesburg, that 13 cars had been sent forward from the mines. One car was reported at liarstow last night. Lr. M. J. Haw ley, managing oii'uer of the hospital, reported today that the crisis is passed, he believes. Though the hos pital supply was nearly exhausted, new supply has come each time before it was necessary to cease operation of the heating plant.

He was 12s arraigned before Police Magistrate Gustatson tn:s morning, ana uu ms j plea of guilty and his promise to re form, it was decided that the best method would be to have him paroled in Moline city court. There was doubt on the part of some of the officials as to whether the city court had jurisdiction in police court cases, but M. J. McEniry, as sistant state's attorney, was sure it had, and it was taken before Judge G. O. Dietz. The necessary papers could not be found and a continuance was taken until this afternoon to secure them from Rock Island. Both the complaining witness and the defendant lived at 1402 Fourth ave nue, Moline. According to Hickson's story, his new suit was missing last night. Mose Zukerman, of whom the boys rented, thought he had seen Bo cox leave with the garments on, and with real sleuth intuition he beat it for the Burlington station, where he found the defendant "all dolled up." Mose attempted to take the clothes off the back of Bocox. A fight ensued and the defendant broke and got away, which caused Mose to call the police, and the arrest, followed. The defend ant is but IS years old. "One more chance is all I want," he said today in court, and he probably will be given it. ence. She blames it all on the kaiser's agents.
