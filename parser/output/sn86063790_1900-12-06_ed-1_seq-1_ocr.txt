"WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. ? When Speaker Henderson called the house to order every member rose In his seat. In the silence that followed the voice of the blind chaplain rose clear and t impressive in prayer. He called the blessings of God down upon the proceedings about to begin. The chaplain made touching reference to the departed members, asking the blessings of heaven upon the bereaved ones left benma. At the conclusion of the prayer the I clerk called the roll of the house. There was so much confusion after the prayer that the roll-call was stopped by the speaker. "All members will take their seats." he ordered. "It is impossible to proceed with the roll-call unless order is restored." His gavel hit the desk rapidly, and ( finally the loud voices and the shuf- | fling of feet subsided. The first bills introduced in the house today were army reorganization and reapportionment bills. The latter is by Crumpacker, of Indiana. It provides for the reapportionment of congressional representa- ! tion and reduces the representation of ; Louisiana. Mississippi, North Carolina ' and South Carolina by 13 votes. According to Crumpacker's bill, the house, will have 3655 members, the ap- 1 portionment being on a basis of 198,000 ! population to each member. The army bill is the work .of the mil- j itary affairs committee and is fathered | by Chairman Hull, of Iowa. THE SENATE COMMITTEE TO WAIT OH PRESIDENT , . WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.?Messrs. !

SESSION WILL BE A MEMORABLE ONE ;: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.?The short I session of congress, beginning today, \ promises to be memorable in the his- J '> tory of the United States. Much work, not ordinarily under- j taken at a short session, has been out- j lined, but although this congress has j ' shown a capacity to dispose of business ! rapidly, it is doubtful whether the en- j' tire program can be carried out. ! ' The democratic program does not j < appear to be one of obstruction, the overwhelming republican victory in November "having had a rather deterrent effect, but in a general way the time will be found too short to make laws of the various propositions pending. Ordinarily a short session is devoted j' almost exculsively to the passage of ap- t propriation bills. The importance of , these measures will be overshadowed ; this year by bills contemplating the j execution of policies of enormous mag- ! Provisions will be made for perhaps the largest expenditures ever known, j There will be a $30,000,000 river and harbor bill; a large public building bill; I a naval appropriation bill which will : exceed by far anything in that line in ; the history of this country; a military appropriation bill which will be a large one: appropriations for the routine needs of the government?needs which are growing every year, and which will be In line with an expansive policy. There are fourteen of these bills. > Their total will not be far from the billion dollar mark. The Nicaragua canal and ship subsidy bills, if passed, will add other millions to Uncle Sam's bill of costs. . , The president begins his message by commenting briefly upon the strength, j prosperity and integrity of the country, calling attention to the increase in pop- ; ulation since the beginning of the cen- j tury. When the sixth congress assem- ! bled in November, 1800, the population was 5,308,483. It is now 76,304,799. We have increased in territory from 909,050 square miles to 3,846,595. The message then proceeds: "In our foreign intercourse the dominant question has been the treatment of the j Chinese problem. Apart from this our ! relations with the powers have been j happy. "The recent troubles in China spring i , from the anti-foreign agitation which * for the past three years has gained j strength in the northern provinces. 1 Their origin lies TIeep in ine cnaracier of the Chinese races and in the traditions of their government. The Tai Ping rebellion and the opening of Chinese ports to foreign trade and settlement disturbed alike the homogeneity and the seclusion of China. "For several years before the present trouble all the resources of foreign di- ! plomaoy, backed by moral demonstra- j tions of the physical force of fleets and I arms, have been needed to secure due ! respect for the treaty rights of for- ! eigners and to obtain satisfaction from j the responsible authorities for the j sporadic outrages upon the persons and i property of unoffending sojourners j which from time to time occurred at j widly separated points in the northern i provinces, as in the case of the out- j breaks in Szechuen and Shan Tung." \ The president then outlines the de- j velopment of the Boxer movement and the efforts of the representatives of the powers in Pekin to check it, their pro- 1 tests and demands upon the Chinese j government, however, only being met j with -perfunctorv edicts from the ! palace, and evasion and futile assur- j ances from the Tsung Li Yamen.

MESSAGE I i 3 Assembling of j iday at Noon. )ines and Cuba Is Treated Questions of Vital Imiliy Considered. United States from the earliest days of foreign intercourse with China had followed a policy of peace, omitting no occasion to testify good will, to further the extension of lawful trade and to insure by all legitimate and kindly, but earnest means, the fullest measure ot x .i- - tl; a pruit-ciivn ior me n\es unu ul our law abiding citizens among the Chinese people. "To these ends I caused," says the president, "to be addressed to the several powers occupying territory and maintaining spheres of influence in China, the circular proposals of 1S99, inviting from them declarations "of their intentions and views as to the desirability of the adoption of measures insuring the benefits of equality of treatment of all foreign trade throughout China. With gratifying unanimity the responses coincided in this common policy. "Seeking to testify confidence in the willingness and ability of the imperial administration to redress the wrongs and prevent the evils we suffered and feared, the marine guard, which had been sent to Pekin in the autumn of 1899, was withdrawn at the earliest practical moment, and all pending questions were remitted, as far as we were 1 concerned, to the ordinary resorts of 1 diplomatic intercourse." Then, recounting how the Chinese government had proved unable to check the Boxers and ; appeared to be a prey to internal dissension, the president leads up to the combined demonstration in Chinese waters by the other powers, stating ' that while the United States did not ' participate in the combined demonstration. we promptly sent from the Philippines all ships that could be spared for service on the Chinese coast. Marines were landed at Taku and sent to Pekin for the protection of the American legation, the other powers taking similar action, but still the peril increased. In referring to the attack ' nTv/-kn tVia Tntn fnrta ' hv the powers, the president makes quite prominent the fact that the American 1 admiral took no part in the affair on ' the ground that we were not at war : with China, and that a hostile demon- J stration might consoMdate anti-foreign < elements and thus strengthen the ! Boxers to oppose the relieving column. The message continues: "The seige and the relief of the legation has passed into undying history. In all the stirring chapter which records the heroism of the devoted band, clinging ! to hope in the face of despair, and the undaunted spirit that led their re- ' [levers through battle and suffering to the goal, it is a memory of which my countrymen may be justly proud that ; the honor of our flag? was maintained ' alike in the seige and the rescue, and that stout American hearts have again set high, in fervent emulation with true men of other race and language, the indomitable courage that ever strives Tor the cause of right h.nd justice." After- a" brief resume of the attacks upon the legation, the killing of the German minister, Baron Von Ketteler, and the means of defense adopted by the besieged, in the course of which he refers to the gallant sortie led by Captain Myers of the United States Marine Corps, the president 1 elates the history of the joint relief expedition. In this connection he says: "The ' United Sta'tes soldiers, sailors and marines, officers and men alike, in those distant climes and unusual surroundings showed the same valor, discipline and good conduct, and gave proof of the same high degree of intelligence . and efficiency which have distinguished them in every emergency." In regard to the settlement of the Chinese question by the powers the president favors the Russian proposition looking to the restoration of the Tmno-ial nrtu-or in "Polriri TTp savs however, that for the real culprits, those who have, misled the imperial Judgment and diverted the sovereign authority to their own guilty ends, full expiation becomes imperative within the rational limits of retributive justice. He looks upon the matter of indemnity for our wronged citizens as a question of grave concern. He is disposed to think that compensation may be made in' part by the opening of China to the equal commerce of ail the world. He adds: "The government of Russia put forward "a suggestion that in the event of protracted divergence of views in regard to indemnities, the matter may be delegated to a court of arbitration at The Hague. I favorably incline to this, believing that the high tribunal could not fail to reach a solution no less conducive to the stability and enlarged prosperity of China itself than immediately beneficial to the powers." The president then devotes several pages to our relations with other powers, touching upon the arrest of our naturalized citizens by the AustroHungarian government for alleged evasion of military service, the expansion of trade between this country and South America, the disturbances in Colombia and the recognition of the new government by the United States; also similar recognition of the new Dominican government. The success of our participation in the Paris exposition was revealed by the number of awards granted to American exhibitors by the international jury, namely: Grand prizes, 240; gold medals, 597; silver medals, 776; bronze medals, 541, and honorable mentions, 322?2,476 in all, being the greatest total number given to any exhibiting nation. The president expresses his satisfaction over our pleasant relations with the German empire, and felicitates the country upon the good results accruing from the settlement of the Samoan problem. He confidently expresses the hope that the enforcement of the imperial meat inspection law will be free from the discriminations prevail ing under the old statutes. "Much will j depend," he says, "upon regulations j not yet promulgated." His paragraph cn the war in South Africa is confined to a legal discussion of the matter of alleged contraband cargoes. In respect to the Alaskan boundary dispute the president again refers to "the need of definitely marking the boundary where it follows the one hundred and forty-first meridian," stating that he contemplates negotiating a new convention for a joint determination of the meridian by telegraphic observation. Sorrow is expressed for the assassination of King Humbert; Referring to the lynching of Italians in Louisiana he reiterates former expressions, again inviting the attention of the country to what he terms "this reproach on our civilization." Praise is bestowed upon Japan's generous co-operation in the joint relief of the beleaguered legations in Pekin. The kindly courtesies extended by the Japanese government and naval officers to the battleship Oregon are also graciously remembered. Regarding the Nicaraguan canal the message says: "I commend to the early attention of the senate the convention with Great Britain to facilitate the construction of such a canal, and to remove any objection which might arise cut of the convention commonly called the Clayton-Buiwer treaty." THb president states: "The Nicara guan government shows a disposition to deal fairly with the canal question, either in the way of negotiations with us or taking measures to promote the waterway." Thanks are expressed to the Imperial Russian government for the aid rendered by .its authorities in Eastern Siberia to American missionaries fleeing from Manchuria. It is stated that satisfactory progress has been made toward the conclusion of a general treaty of friendship and intercourse with Spain, in replacement of the old treaty, which passed into abeyance by reason of the late war. Reference is made to the purchase of Sibutu and Cagavan, Sulu, by the United States for $100,000. In the matter of indemnities due from Turkey the president says: "We await the fulfillment of the promise of the sultan to make reparation for the injuries suffered by American citizens in Armenia and elsewhere in the Turkish empire. His majesty's good disposition in this regard has been evinced by the issuance of an irade for rebuilding the American college at Harpoot." The senate is mildly criticized for its failure during the last session to act jpon the commercial conventions then submitted fofc its consideration and inprova!, much disappointment to the igricultural and industrial interests of Ihe country being caused thereby. The president is pleased with the ively interest manifested in the LatinAmerican states in the exposition to be leld at Buffalo next year. He adds: "The policy of reciprocity so manifestly rests upon the principles >f international equity and has been so -epeatedly approved by the peopie 01 i the United States that there ought to :>e no hesitation in either branch of congress in giving to it full effect." The surplus revenues for the fiscal rear, ended June 30. were $79,527,060.18. For the six preceding years we had >nly deficits, the aggregate of which imounted to more than two hundred nillion dollars. Because of the excess >f revenues over expenditures, bonds md other securities have been applied :o the sinking fund to the amount of >56,544,556.06. "Our foreign trade," he says, "shows a remarkable record of commercial and industrial progress. The growth of manufactures in the United States is evidenced by the fact :hat exports of manufactured products argely exceed those of any previous rear, and agricultural products were ilso exported during 1900 in greater ,'oiume than in 1899." He continues: "I recommend that the congress at. ts present session reduce the internal evenue taxes, imposed to meet the war vith Spain in the sum of $30,000,000. This reduction should be secured by he remission of those taxes which experience has shown to be the most purdensome to the industries of the people." Congress is again urged to take imnediate action looking to the promoion of American shipping and foreign ;rade, though no direct reference is r.ade to the pending subsidy meastre. The president refers to his last anlual message, in which he spoke of :he necessity for early action to remedy th? evils of trusts. "It is apparent," he continues, "that miform legislation upon this subject in the several states is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that such uni'ormity, founded in wise and just discrimination between what is injurious md what is useful and necessary in business operations, may be outlined. Restraint upon sucn comu laacivito uw i ire injurious and which "are within federal jurisdiction should be promptly ipplied by the congress." In taking up the Philippine question :he president reiterates his former de:ermination to uphold the sovereignty >f the United States in the islands "as n all other places where our flag rightfully floats." He then quotes extensively from his nstructions to the commission head.?d by Judge William H. Taft, in which t was authorized to assume civil conrol of the archipeligo on September 1, .900. Much stress is laid upon the iesirability of establishing and mainlining a civil service system in the nunicipal and departmental govern nents. Late reports from the comnission show an encouraging advance .oward "insuring the benefits of lib;rty and good government to the Filipinos. in the interest of humanity, and .vith the aim of building up an enluring, self-supporting and self-adminstering community in those far eastern seas." Continuing, he says: "I would impress upon the congress :hat whatever legislation may be- enacted in respect to the Philippine isands should be along these generous ines. The fortune of war has thrown lpon this nation an unsought trust vhieh should be unselfishly discharg?d, and devolved upon this government a. moral as well as material responsiDility toward these millions whom we nave freed from an oppressive yoke, t have on another occasion called the Filipinos 'the wards of the nation.' Our obligation as guardian was not lightly assumed; it must not be otherwise :han honestly fulfilled, aiming first of all to benefit those who have come un- j 3er our fostering care. It is our duty ; 30 to treat them that our flag may be j not less beloved in the mountains of I Luzon and the fertile zones ^>f Mindanao and Negros, than it is at home, and there, as here, it shall be the revered symbol of liberty, enlightenment and progress in every avenue of development." "The Filipinos are a quick race to learn and to profit by knowledge. He would be rash who, with the teachings of contemporaneous history in view, would fix a limit to the degree of eulQai'Qnr>omont vpt within the lUic aiiu auttt**vv?*.w.? reach of these people if our duty toward them is faithfully performed." The president commends the success which has attended the labors of the governor of Porto Rico and his associates. Congress is requested to confer ! upon the secretary of the interior su- | pervislon over the public lands in that island. The president promises that when the Cubans' constitutional convention shall have finished its labors he will transmit to congress the constitution as framed, for such action as may be deemed advisable. The recommendation for a Pacific ! cable between the United States and .Hawaii, with an extension to Manila, is renewed, surveys having shown the entire feasibility of a chain of cables which at each stopping place shall touch on American territory. In reference to the army the president states that for the present our five or six thousand troops in Cuba cannot be withdrawn or materially diminished, and certainly not until the conclusion of the labors of the constitutional convention and a government provided by the new constitution shall have been established and its stability assured. Nor is there room for further reduction in Porto Rico, where the garrisons now number 1.633 men, which includes 879 native troops. "We will be required," he says "to keep a considerable force in the Philippine islands for some time to come. From the best information obtainable, we will need there for the immediate future from 45,000 to GO,000 men. I am sure the number may be reduced, as the insurgents shall come to acknowledge the authority of the United States, of which there are assuring indications." The president therefore asks for authority to increase the army to the present number of 100,000. He thinks that included in this number authority should be given to raise native troops in tho Philinninoa nn tn 1 AAA n-Vi ioVi the Taft commission believe will be more effective in detecting and suppressing guerrillas, assassins and ladrones than our own soldiers. He favors the recommendation of the secretary of war for the detail of officers from the line of the army when vacancies occur in the various staff departments. "The army," he concludes, "cannot be too highly commended for its faithful and effective service in active military operations in the field and the difficult work of civil administration." The navy is similarly complimented upon its services in connection with the insurrections in the Philippines and the recent disturbances in China. The president expresses his gratifica tion upon the settlement of the long pending question of armor plate manufacture, a reasonable price having een secured, thus obviating the necessity for a government plant. The secretary's recommendations for new vessels' and additional officers and men are approved. Favorable action by congress is solicited for the measure providing for a statue to the memory of the late Admiral David D. Porter. He also commends the establishment of a national naval reserve, and of the grade of vice-admiral. Suitable provision for medals and rewards on account of distinguished service, in both the army and nav>\ is recom-? mended. The extension of rural free delivery by the postal service is cordially approved. He comments at length upon the excellent work accomplished by the census bureau in collecting industrial statistics. It is recommended that congress in its present session shall apportion representation in the several states as provided by the constitution, and in accordance with the results of the new census. Regarding the work of the department of agriculture, he says: "The department has been extending its work during the past year, reaching further 'for new varieties of seeds and plants: co-operating more fullv with the states and territories in research along useful lines; making progress in meteorological work relating to lines of wireless telegraphy and forecasts for ocean going vessels; continuing inquiries as to animal disease; studying soils that producers may cultivate with better knowledge of conditions, and helping to clothe desert places with grasses suitable to our arid conditions." Before concluding the message, the president urges the erection of a separate building for the purpose of preserving the annually accumulating archives of the departments. The message closes with the following words: "In our great prosperity we must g"uard against the danger it invites of extravagance in government expenditures and appropriations; and the chosen representatives of the people will, I doubt not, furnish an example in-their legislation of that wise economy which in a season of plenty husbands for the future. In this'era of great business activity and epportunity, caution is not untimely. It will not abate, but strengthen confidence. It will not retard, but promote., legitimate industrial and commercial expansion. Our growing power brings with it temptations and perils requiring constant viligence to avoid. It must not be used to invite conflicts, nor for oppression, but for the more effective maintenance of. those principles of equality and justice upon which our Institutions and happiness depend. Let us keep always in mind that the foundation of our government is liberty; its superstructure peace.

F-mneror William's refusal to receive Mr. Krnger Las occasioned surprise in Paris. Most of the morning papers make it an excuse for articles sympathizing with the Boer statesman or condemning the kaiser.

SOUTH CAROLINA 2 j STATE NEWS ITEMS. ] fcfsirjcMCNirorsjrjrsi? Fired at Senator Henderson. A Columbia dispatch says: It is believed an attempt was made a few nights ago to assassinate State Senator D. S. Henderson, of Aiken, one of the leading lawyers in the state. Fie was returning to his home from Charleston. The train stopped at White Pond. As it started a bullet crashed through the window, a few inches above the senator's head, the glass falling iu his lap. There is no clue to the perpetrator of the outrage. *** Xcw Short Cnt Finished. Just a year ago the Southern opened its Perry extension, giving it an outlet to the south without depending on the Florida Central and Peninsular. A day or two ago the extension, or short cut from Allendale to Hardeeville, that has been under construction for several months, was completed. This lets the Southern into Savannah by use of only a few miles of the Piaut system and shortens the distance between Columbia and Savannah by 14 miles, a considerable item with the hot speed competition of the Seaboard. ?*? Hit; Hatch of Convicts. The largest number of prisoners convicted at one term of the criminal court in Charleston in years were sent to the state penitentiary in Columbia the past week. Three men go up for life and all of the others will have to serve long terms. The youngest prisoner in the bunch is Coleman Singleton, a highway robber only ten years of age. He held up a lady on the leading thoroughfare in Charleston and robbed her of a purse containing 805. Out of twelve murder cases, one prisoner will be kept in Charleston to be hanged. He is James Kelley, aud he will pay the penalty on the gallows on January 4th. *** JEIotel Plana Are Ready. Plans for the Villa Margherita, the rr>anmifieont Tvhioh IVfninr Andrew Simonds and a syndicate propose to build on the waterfront in Charleston, have been received from New York. The plans are elaborate and artistic and are worked out with rare skill and taste. Speaking of the hotel Major Simonds said that the prospect for building was excellent: A party of wealthy New Yorkers are keenly interested in the project and are prepared at any time to put up the money needed for carrying it out. It is desired to have a portiou of the stock raised in Charleston, and if the amount apportioned for the city is subscribed, the building will begin immediately. #% Jurisdiction of Justices. At Greenville Judge Aldrich has made a decision concerning the jurisdiction of magistrates which will curtail the action of these officers in civil cases. A case came before court on appeal from a magistrate's decision, the appeal bringing out the point that the magistrate had acted on a case outside of his magisterial territory. It has beeu the practice in this county to try civil cases from any part of the county. Judge Aldrich decided that magistrates have no jurisdiction in civil cases outside of their territorial limits. This decision will end such practice, so far as the county is concerned, and if the judge is not reversed, will establish the practice for the state. ** Exposing Pension Francis. What is claimed to be a wholesale fraudulent scheme to obtain pension money from the federal government is hpino nnparthed in Charleston, and already two of the pension attorneys, j charged with being ringleaders, have been placed under arrest. They are George P. McClay, a pension agent and notary public, and Solomon Brown, a notary. They were arrested on a charge of forgery and have been bound over to the district court on heavy bond. The pension examiners who were sent to Charleston expect J to have other indictments. It is said that probably fifty people will be 1 mixed up in the affair, and nearly this many arrests will be made, it is claimed. For several months, the pension bureau has been working quietly around Charleston, and out of the bulk of the | evidence secured it is said that this is strong enough to lodge the ringleaders behind prison bars for a good long term. Hundreds of pension papers which were sent to Washington were found to be forgeries, and the plan to defraud was so great that immediate steps were taken to apprehend the leaders. It is alleged that the pension agents have been using ignorant negroes on the sea islands as dupes, but many of these pension seekers are said to be in the fraudulent scheme. No Divorces Granted. The recent agitation on the question of divoice and the general outcry against the wholesale abuse of the law throughout the country has been accepted as a fine morsel by the lawmakers and clergy of South Carolina who led the fight in the last constitutional convention, which resulted in a clause forever refusing the rupture of the marriage ties by the courts. The fact is recalled, however, that for six years?from 1872 to 1878?the laws of this state allowed the granting of divorces on certain grounds, but from all records available there is nothing to ' show of the least attempt to abuse the privilege. According to a recent statement made by Attorney General Bellinger, in reply to a scathing misrepresentation from an Iudiana judge, not. more than three divorce cases were before the courts during the six years the law was in effect. While this record is accepted as both gratifying and satisfactory, the universal belief is that were there a divorce law in South Carolina at the present time more married people would seek a legal separation, and the record might be in keeping with the record for other states. Taken as a whole, however, the people of South Carolina are proud of the fact that this is the only state in the union where divorces are not granted. After the repeal of the divorce law in 1878 there were various efforts on foot 'XtL&S*.- * ' "n - " - .v.:., to have the auti-divorce law repealed, but all of these failed, after more or leas lighting i:i the legislature. It wa? ' contended that such a law should bo en the statutes of this state, so that | South Carolina would act in line with every other state, and the ground was to have the grouud for divorce limited to adultery, if nothing more. When j the constitutional convention assembled, the day after the opening it was proposed that divorces be allowed for i aduitry, and after a tight which was kept running for three weeks, the death knoll of the divorce hope was sounded. All effort now has been I given up of ever having the law repealed, and this sentiment with the law has grown stronger in view of the tirade which has been made against the abuse of the privilege.

AFTER GIBSON. Degenerate Fiend Forced Red-Hot Poker Down' His Little Stepdaughter's Throat. A special, under date of Friday, says: "All day hundreds of people ; have walked the streets in the little town of Catlettsburg, in Boyd county, awaiting and wishing for the return of j the searching party bringing back to " _ rrriii.* m. me scene oi nis crime wiuiam vxiuson, who so cruelly murdered his stop-daughter Wednesday night by running a led hot poker down her throat. "Gibson, who escaped hatless and coatless, has disappeared as though the earth had swallowed him up. Kumors came thick and fast during the day and kept the waiters in a frenzy. They showed that they do not intend to let the law have its course. It was reported that Gibson was captured five miles from town and that the officers had spread the report that his half brother instead was under arrest in order to throw the crowd off its guard, but it cannot be learned as yet whether this is true or not. Gibson is a much hunted man. The two bloodhounds put on his trail could do nothing since they could get no lead from the house where the crime was committed. "Gibson is thirty-five years old. His wife was a widow and three-year-old Lillian Patrick was her only child. Gibson disliked the child. Another rumor is that Gibson is insane and is defying arrest in the hills between Boyd and Louis counties. There are several organized posses in pursuit and many volunteers in the chase." BRITONS TIRED OF WAR. London Financial Journal Urges That Government Ask For Peace In South Africa. The London Statist proposes that the government should begin negotiations with Commandant General Botha and General Dewet to bring the war to a close. As the Boer leaders might misunderstand the motive of an overture from the military authorities, it will suggest that the highest civil author ity in Cajje To-wti should begin the negotiations, if not Sir Alfred Miluer, then the chief justice of Cape Colony, or even J. H. Hofmeier. Tins great nnanciai jonruai jeaas up to its proposal by an analysis of the situation in South Africa, and says: "We are losing in every way, losing in prestige and losing in life. We are seeing oar South African possessions plunged into greater distress, and the opinion is gaining ground abroad that we are incapable of bringing the struggle to a satisfactory termination." Military incompetence is alleged, and the Statist avers that military harshness should be avoided and the Boers be conciliated. "If men like Botha and Bewet voluntarily surrender and bind themselves not to act against us in the future," says The Statist, "is there any good reason why a promise should not be given not to send them out of j the country? J. B. Robinson suggests that Botha and Dewet should be invited to take seats in the legislative council that will be established. The suggestion is worthy of approval. The Boers should not be excluded, even from the beginning, from anything which can safely be given them." TRAGEDY IN JACKSONVILLE. Bad Negro Kills Two Men and Seriously IVounds Another. Thanksgiving day was one of tragedy in Jacksonville, Fla. There were twenty thousand visitors in the city to witness the carnival. The streets were congested from early morning until late at night. In some sections there was considerable rowdyism throughout the day. Late in the afternoon, at the corner of Davis and West Forsyth, Policeman Henry Raley arrested a negro for ugunug. A mob of fifty negroes, headed by John Baxter, son of a well-to-do barkeeper, demanded the release of the prisoner. Before Baley could draw his gun he was shot dead by Baxter. Ex-Policeman Tucker ran to the officer's assistance and received two serious wounds in the abdomen. Chandler Brooks, an inoffensive negro, attempted to assist the dying officer, and was shot dead.

LONDON PAPERS ARE DESPONDENT Prominent Journal Ularnes Russia and United States For Present Unsatisfactory Situation. The London Spectator, in a striking article dealing with the Chinese crisis, expresses the opinion that the most recent developments at Pekin foreshadow a Chinese victory over the allies. "The quarrel has been broaght to the test oi force," it says, "and force on the civilized side has proved insufficient. This result is mainly due the attitude of Russia and the United States. If China escapes with the payment of a small indemnity and nany promises on paper, as seems not unlikely, since Germany and Great Britain may not be willing to incur the expenditure and'risk involved in persisting in their demands, it will be equivalent to a victory for China, for nothing ha? occurred which will con'r vince the Chinese that their mighty empress has been defeated or that Europe can avenge any future massacres." The Shanghai correspondent of The Morning Post, wiring Thursday, srfys: "Despite the cordial reception given Admiral Seymonr, the situation is unchanged. The Hankow viceroy refuses to stop sending supplies to the court unless the Nankin viceroy will also refuse; and the latter, although he undertakes to send no more arms, says he must continue sending supplies so long as the emperor requires them. '' In fact, all our remonstrances amount to a miserable farce. We have, no courage to do more than to talk. Iu the Chinese theater here the allies are represented by a soldier with an enormous month, who does nothing but talk until his career is ended by decapitation." "The Janese consul here," says the Shanghai correspondent of The Daily London News, "acting under instructions from Tokio, has withdrawn his assent to the consular proclamation forbidding the importation of articles used in the manufacture of war articles. This action has caused general onmrico Tfc in mmnrpd that the t" -- ? Chinese are actively purchasing arms and ammunition and the customs officials are conniving at tbe passage of false declarations, under the official instructions." The Shanghai correspondent of The Times, says: "Reports of uneasiness at Tien Tsin continue. Chinese regulars and boxers are believed to be returning to that district secretly and a renewal of trouble is feared when the port is closed for the winter. "It is alleged that the Kalgan expedition met with a reverse and it is believed that a party of Germans who were cut off were obliged to abandon their dead and wounded." On the other hand Count von Waldersee has telegraphed to Berlin that the German column was returning from Kalgan and would continue the march under General Gayl." A similar reverse had been previously rumored and denied at Berlin,

OSTEOPATHS TUBNED DOWN. The Georgia Senate Not In Favor of L;cenfting the New Cult. The adverse action, of the Georgia senate on the report of the general judiciary committee on the osteopathy bill came in the nature of a surprise, as the passage of the measure was regarded as certain. When it was seen, at last, that the issue would be a close one in the senate, an attempt was made to amend the bill, so as to allow osteopathists to practice their profession in the state without formally recognizing them by law. The ameudrnent failed and the bill was subsequently defeated by a vote of 19 to 18. MUCH COIN AX1> BULLION. United States Treasury and Branches Are Well Stocked With Gold.

SHORT SESSION IS UNDER WAY J "Yiffla Nation's Lawmakers Assemble at | Capital and Begin Business REPUBLICANS AT THE HELMDemocrrls Were Short on Bou- .-'Jm quels While Desks of Their Opponents Were Loaded. The short session of congress prom* J ises to be a busy one. The feature of the opening day was ^ J the reading of the president's message. _ ^ There was no surprises, however, in the document. That portion of it treating of affairs in China was listened to with more than orlinaiy. interest. ' The chief feature of this had to do ; with the treatment of the natiyov?i Christians. There was also interest ,3 manifested in his announcement of the^JIR': appointment of Chief Justice Fuller . 3 . and Attorney General Griggs aa members of the permanent court of arbi- . "J tration provided for by The Hague . ** conference. There are four members- |i?;$ from each government, and the ap-^ " V pointment of ex-President Harrison i and Judge George Gray had already A been announced. 'M Next to the Chinese question what^ ' the president had to say on the Phil- | ippine question attracted most atten- " . tion. A close study of his utterances show his programme to be "thobnild- - I ing up of au enduring, self-supporting fM and self-administering community for || those far easteru seas." -vThe reference to building up the 3j merchant marine is rot as specific as.:^ the friends of the present ship subsidy '' ' bill would have liked it to be. They, however, reiterate their conviction that the bill will pass. II Such a profuse display of floral trib- g utes as was in evidence on the desks of * jff Bepublican senators and Bepresenta* A iivfla vVtAn fVio mhOTMu arm Am hi Ad h?<l seldom been equaled. On the Democratic side there was almost a dearth ifaaBB of anything of the sort, the few mem- |p bers who were remembered by con- ^ stituents and friends having to be '\content with a simple bnnohof chrys- |p anthemams or roses, bat almost every p. Republican was elaborately rememThe golden chrysanthemum was ?p- ; parentlythe favorite dower of those who bonght flowers for Republican | m congressmen, whether, the purchasers b ' were friends or relatives, or, as is 3 sometimes the case, the congressmen themselves. The difference in the rel- M ative quality and quantity of the trib- jjp| utes of this kind as between the two VaSft sides was about in proportion to the^ ~-'M difference in the quantity ot joy with " '.9 which members of the two partie^^ greeted the opening of congress. The 9 Republicans were fall of it, while tbw^T Democrats were anything but happy \ M under the good natnred raillery of | 33 their Republican friends over the 9 tion results. The recent overwhelming defeat of ? the Democratic party had a marked effect on the members of the house || and the Democratic leaders are being ;Wj|chided and joked by the Republicans, !? They are taking the situation in good numor, nowever. A resolution in behalf of ex-PreeP'^||jffl dent Kruger was introduced in the ^ house by Representative Fitzgerald, "<:M of Massachusetts. It cites: "Whereas, The heroic struggle made ; by the Boer republics to maintain i|j their existence has excited the 1 pathy of the whole world; therefore, "Resolved, That the efforts of Paul Kruger to obtain the assistance of the civilized nations of the world in aecuring peace and proper terms of set- ||| tlement between Great Britain and the . % Boer republic is deserving of the praise v | and sympathy of the American people."
