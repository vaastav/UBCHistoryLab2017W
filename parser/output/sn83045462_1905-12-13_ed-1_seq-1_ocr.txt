WASHINGTON, D. C., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1905- TWENTY-TWO PAGES, TWO CENTS ; to and west OUTLOOK IS CHEERING Situation in Russia Reported Much Improved. FEARS OF STRIKE GONE OFFICIALS HOPE WITTE WILL YET OVERCOME OBSTACLES. Premier's Position Defined Most Clear ly With Workmen's Delegation? Views on Universal Suffrage. ST. PETERSBURG, Tuesday, December X2 (Morning). Via Edyktkuhnen, East Prus i?la. December in.?The restoration of cable communication with points abroad yester day lasted only a few hours. Before mid night it was reported that the cable was cut and that dispatches must again be for warded by courier via the German frontier. Nevertheless the outlook is clearing. The government is breathing freer, with a lighting chance that Premier Witte will yet be able to steer hts way through the rocks which beset his path. The threat of a gen eral strike in the immediate future has dis appeared, and the telegraph strike, not be ing supported, is going to pieces in spite of the wild appeals of the union to stand llrm At Moscow the tie-up remains complete, but at many other places communication has been reopened, although in a precarious fashion, as the employes of both the tele graph and postal services, who were dis charged by wholesale for refusing to work, are cutting the wires wherever it Is pos sible to do so. The real leaders of the workmen and other proletariat organizations, realizing fully their weakness and lack of prepara tion for a decisive struggle, have carried the day over the hot-headed strikers, and j have easily convinced the majority that it ; would be an irretrievable blunder to prosti- j tute what they regard as the supreme in- 1 Btrument for forging a free nation by us:ng It for a minor Issue like redressing the grievances of private Individuals. in registering this decision they placed ; themselves on record "to continue the or- ! ganlzation and equipment of the lighting legions which the old president, Krustaleft, began," thus virtually fnrnfshing the gov- | eminent with evidence confirming its ' charges that articles 10- and 1-ti of the \ criminal code, prohibiting participation In I associations the object of which is armed revolt and the punishment for which is death, have been violated by the strikers' head organization. It is likely, however, that the govern ment in order to discount attempts to heroize M. Kruslaleff will simply charge iilrn with the misappropriation'of the funds of the workmen In using them In founding a socialist paper, which the government claims can be substantiated. Demand KrufitalefTs Release. The workmen's council yesterday sent a demand to Count Wltte for the release of M. Krustaleft. l.ater the workmen's delegates called on Procurator Kannlshansky and de manded his release, but .the pretcurator re fused bluntly, saying that the case must be tried in court. To this the spokesman of the delegation replied: "Then we will declare a general strike." "I will not release him If the whole world strikes," answered the procurator. il. KrustalelT Is understood to bo Impris oned In the St. Peter and St. Paul fortress in order, it is explained, to prevent any possible attempt at rescue, which would only lead to bloodshed. The disappearance of the danger of a general strike seems to insure the govern ment a certain period In which to vindicate itself and demonstrate that it Is striving to release the new order of things and if, its friends hope, it will be able to show this by deeds. It will cut away public sym pathy from the proletariat and place the workmen's organ lzatfons when the time comes for a strike in the attitude of de liberately provoking a struggle to over throw the government and establish a dem ocratic republic. Reaction Denied by Cabinet. The mesmbers of Count Witte's cabinet distinctly deny that the government has entered on the path of reaction, but they toy that the present state of anarchy can not go on. People amenable to the laws will be arrested and tried by the courts. *'If the government really enters on the path of reaction," said, one of the ministers today, "it must end in a dictatorship and you may be sure that at the first evi dence of this Wltte will step down and out." Oount Wltte takes the ground that the aalnlifciry is only a stopgap to transfer the power into the hands of the national as sembly, and. therefore he will not undertake U> hind the country by temporary laws or a policy which the representatives of the na tion should decide for themselves. This Is the theory on which complete, universal suffrage will be refused - The situation in the Baltic provinces Is ?hw the most grave of the empire's condi tions. It approaches civil war, and the government has been forced to appoint a governor general with sweeping adminis trative powers to try to restore order. All the troops In these provinces have been placed under his command. The Importa tion of arms, which have been entering the country In large quantities, and the sale of weapons have been prohibited, and the authorities are even empowered to arrest for three months under an administrative order persons having arms In their poss- e sion. The Government's Precautions. At the same time the government recog nizes that crushing the growing rebellion by force will not suffice, and that some sort of local self-government will alone quiet the population. Therefore, it has or dered the convocation of representatives of the various classes of the provinces. In cluding the peasants, to work out a scheme for the creation of a zemstvo to control local affairs. M. Petrunkevlch, president of the Agri cultural Society of Moscow, and the lead ing delegate of the Moscow zemstvo In St. Petersburg, and his colleagues are return ing to Moscow without Count Witte's re s ply to the zemstvo s demands, although It Is practically ready, the correspondent of the Associated Press having seen the doc ument. Firms Tendered Support. At the workmen's meeting last night the members of the Finnish "national guard." really a socialist organization, tendered their support and a sailor claiming to represent the majority of his comrades declared the sailors' solidarity with the proletariat, promising that when the signal la given the sailors will be found ready. The commission which Is discussing peas ant legislation has reached an exceedingly Important decision Involving the right of the communes to assign lands in severalty to individuals, which would give them the right tc sell the lands at will, thus virtu ally sounding the knell of the communal system. Where the peasants desire to re tain the commune, however, they may nu>rtgage the lands and obtain money, to purchase additional lands, make lmp/6vfc ments and buy agricultural impler/.ents This decision is based on the fact that the emperor's permission of further Pay ments of the peasants' arrearages of debt Mtded the necessity for communal owner Bhlp, which in reality was a device of the government to hold the entire community responsible for the redemption of land granted when selfdom wasabolished.

Secretary of State Root attended tho meeting of the Senate committee on for eign relations today. lie discussed the bill introduced by Senator Dodge provid ing for the reorganization of the consular service. It Is understood that the Isle of Pines treaty and the treaty relating to Santo Do mingo were considered briefly, although the latter convention was reported to the Senate last scss on and > ? sterday an effort to have it s-^nt hack to the committee was opposed, and therefore was not urged strongly by Mr. l.cdge, who had made the motion. The Secretary of Stale asked that the consular service be classified and the President authorized to assign members of the classes pro-posed to such posts as the Interests of tli?- ser\ ice require, instead of having appointments m-ide for spiel ed posts. The creation of an adequate nspec tion scrv:ce and tie abolishment of the fee system was r<> -mir,ended by Secretary Root in accordance with the recommenda tion made by President Roosevelt In his message to Cc '.gross. This would necessi tate a materia! increase in salaries at con sulates where the fee system has been fol lowed. An increase in working forces was asked for. the Secretary say ng that at a number of foreign posts there are not suf iicient employes for the performance of tint is imposed by the immigration laws. The need of suitable quarters for embas sies and legations was emphasized by the Secretary, who declared that the poor ac commodations provided detract from the respect to which the diplomatic represen tatives of this government are entitled. Secretary Root also asked the committee to -make provision for the creation of the post of minister to the new kingdom of Norway.

These offenses on your par' have led to a calamity so clearly unfore seen by you and so distressing that n,i words of reproof can be needed to make you feel their gravity. Your disobedience to the laws of your country; your forget fulness of the full import of your oath; your yielding to fierce and-angry passions when tempted by a sense of wrong, navo borne fruits so bitter that your worst pun ishment has been already suffered. The nierelful sentence of the court which tried you leaves you a member of the honorab'e profession you have chosen. In that great school of self-sacrifice and obedience, a life useful to your country will. It is hoped, atone for grave faults which have clouded the early years of your service. "You will acknowledge receipt of this letter, and it will be entered on your ottl dal record. Respectfully. tSigned) "CHARGES J. BONAPARTE, "Secretary." CRAWFORD ON WITNESS STAND.

NATIONAL BANKING LAWS. Notable Changes Uiged at American Bankers' Banquet. CHICAGO, 111., December 13.?Changes in [ the national banking laws which will pre vent a recurrencc of such financial disas ters as swept the nation in 1S93 wero urged at the annual dinner of the Illinois Manu facturers' Association last night by Presi dent John L. Hamilton of the American Bankers' Association. "We need, first, a properly secured elas tic currency under federal control," said Mr. HamMton. "Secondly, there should be a change In the limitations on the amount of loans, a provision that Is constantly violated by all national banks. The third suggestion cov ers the privilege of lending a limited amount on not to exceed 40 to 50 per cent of a fair cash value of real estate. "I recommend also a change in the man ner of selecting bank examiners and the payment of each examiner of a fixed salary, with such assistants as may be required to properly perform his duties. "The bankers of America have come to a point where they have to deal with inter national finance, as we are fast becoming the dominant financial power of the world and have not only to deal with financial conditions at home, but abroad. This has brought about a new development in bank ing that must have legislation to pro tect it." President Hamilton spoke a strong word in favor of the ship subsidy, declaring the fact that this nation Is continually produc ing more in manufactured goods and in grains than can be consumed at home, and suggested the necessity of "safeguarding our interests by encouraging the building of American vessels that will deliver our prod ucts to any part of the world."

JUSTICES OF TEE PEACE FIVE CONFIRMED BY BENATEr? CHARGES AGAINST TERRELL. The Senate yesterday afternoon confirmed five justices of the peace for th<* District of Columbia, but failed to confirm the nom ination of Robert H. Terrell to be one of the Justices. Tlie omission of the name of Mr. Terr oil from the list" of confirmations was the result of a protest that had been sent to the Capitol by Mr. J. N. Johnson, a colored man and a clerk in the pension office. Mr. Johnson charges that Mr. Terrell was largely responsible for the failure of the Capital Savings Hank, an institution that was conducted by colored men and in which Mr. Terrell was largely interested. It is un derstood that this charge includes allega tions of a serious nature which are sufficient to have the nomination held up until an In vestigation can be made by the Senate com mittee on the District of Columbia. The committee will meet on Friday and at iliat time the statement of Mr. John son will be laid before the committee. Either at that meeting or at some other time in the near future Mr. Terrell wlll.be asked to make a statement in defense of himself, and no action will be taken by the committee until such a statement has been received or at least until he has had opportunity to make it. What Mr. Terrell's Friends Say. Mr. Terrell's friends declare that Mr. Johnson is inspired by personal dislike of the colored man, who has been nominated to be u. Justice of the peace, rather than from any motive of preventing the appoint ment of an unfit man for the place. They say that Mr. Terrell lias never been guilty of any wrongdoing, ar.d that so far as the bank transaction is concerned he lost money in it and did not profit by anything done in connection with that enterprise. They say the failure of the bank was the result of management and unfortunate cir cumstances that could not be controlled by Mr. Terrell and that ho should not be held responsible for the result. It is also asserted that Mr. Terrell made himself unpopular with many colored peo ple by reading thorn a lecture on the man ner of procedure in order to rise in the world He advised them to work hard, attend to their dirties, and scolded colored men for idleness when they should .be at work, and declared that the inefficiency of colored domestic help was resulting in many colored people being crowded out of employment. It id said that this stand taken by him has made enemies for him, and that Mr. Johnson is one of them. The nominations of the following to be justice of the peace were confirmed by the Senate yesterday afternoon: Lewis I. O'Neal,Samuel C. Mills, Luke C. Strlder, Thomas H. Callan and Charles S. Bundy. AGAINST W. E. HEARST NEW YORK COURT DECIDES BAL LOT BOX CASE. ALBANY, N. Y? December 13.?The court of appeals, in a decision handed down to day in the New York city ballot box case, sustains the contention of counsel for May or George B. McClellan and denies that of attorneys for Wm. Randolph Hearst and his colleagues on the municipal own ership league ticket. The court holds, as was argued by former Chief Judge Parker and his associates, that the courts have no power under the elec tion law to order by mandamus tbe open ing of the ballot boxes and a recount and rccanvass of ballots. The case relates directly to the vote far mayor, controller and president of tne board of aldermen cast in the second elec tion district of the sixth assembly district of New York county at the election ot November 7 last, but Is of the utmost im portance in Mr. Hearst's contest lor the mayoralty of New York city, and is funda mental in its effect upon the electoral sys tem of this state under the present election The decision was rendered by a divided court, five to two, the majority compris ing Chief Judge Cullen and Judges Gray. O'Brien. Halgbt and Werner, Judges Bart lett and Vann dissenting. Gist of the Decision. The gtet of the majority of the oplnun Is that the courts are "without power or authority to order a recount of the ballots cast In the election district," and that therefore the candidates defeated on the face of t)he returns are "left to such action ot law, or otherwise, as inay be appro priate wherein to question It, as to the ballots counted without question."

'Conference Over Postmaster at Chicago. THE SPEAKER'S STORY AN OLD COMRADE OF THE PRESI DENT CALLS. | Indian Territory Nominations Talked About, as Well as Several Other Matters, by Callers. Senator Hopkins of Illinois had a short j conference with the President. It is re ported that he has decided to give his support for postmaster of Chicago to Fred Bussey. a well-known politician of that city, and that Senator Cullom will Join in recommending Bussey. Senator Hopkins would not deny or confirm the report, but it is believed that Bussey's name will soon go to the Senate. Postmaster Coyne has made a good postmaster at Chicago, and has ^he strong: backing of many business men, but he has not been able to secure the backing of Senator Hopkins, and that means hW defeat, as things now look. Bus sey was in the Illinois state senate and has taken part in nearly every state convention for a number of years. Speaker Cannon's Story.

Mickey got 4 and 0 from O'Malley to get ills father out of purgatory, and a day or two afterward i O'Malley asked Mickey, as the latter was | shaving him. if his father was out of pur gatory. 'Almost,' said Mickey. 'Did you give the priest the money for the masses?' asked O'Malley. 'I did not,' replied Mickey, 'because my father d dn't need it.' 'How was that?' asked O'Malley. 'Why, the priest said, when I asked him how near my father was out of purgatory: "He's .lust at the entrance, almost squeezed out. lust between Hie door and the jamb, in fact," and I says, "If my father's as near the out side of purgatory as that there's nothing in h 1 that can keep him from getting t'hrough." ' Now, that the way with Mc Kinley here. 1 knew that If I got him into the door of the President's office nothing could keep him from going through."

AFTER AN OFFICE. Mr. Loomis Interested in Consular Service Reorganization. The statement In a New York paper this morning that Mr. Francis B. Loomis is supposed to be an applicant for the Jap anese mission and that he Is seeking cer tain political support to that end Is wholly lr-accurate and without foundation. Mr. I.oomls said, when he saw the dls petch from Washington: "This statement Is a baseless conjecture and nothing else. I am not an applicant, active or passive, for any governmental of fice, either in this country or abroad, and am not seeking or thinking alxjut po'ltlcal support. I am in this city in connection with the discussion of the proposed reor ganization of the American consular service and I shall doubtless say or write some thing on thi* subject which interests me deeply, as It shou'd all good citizens. 1 have been giving this question eirne.?t con sideration fiom time to time for many years, and I ain more than gratified to see the solid and lively interest which now seems to he manifested In it throughout the country." CAUCUS ON STATEHOOD. Practically No Opposition to the Ham ilton Bill. The House republicans will caucus to morrow afternoon, after the adjournment ol' the House, on the Hamilton statehood bill, providing for the admission of the four territories of Oklahoma, Indian Terri tory, Arizona and New Mexico as two states. There will be practically no oppo sition to the Hamilton bill, and from pres ent Indications the measure may be passed and sent over to the Senate before the ad journment of Congress for the Christinas holidays. The caucus was called largely in order that those members of the House who have previously gone on record in fa vor of separate statehood may crawl un der the party blanket. The Hamilton bill expressed the senti ment of republicans on the statehood qms tion, and the caucus will agree on a lule by which the measure may be hustled through the House without the loss of any time In useless discussion. The committee on territories, of wnicn Mr. Hamilton, author of the bill, is chair man, considered the statehood bill torfav, but It will not be reported until after no caucus. Some minor amendments may Do offered by that body. Mr. Hamilton Intro duced the bill December 5, the second day oi' the present session, and the measure embodies the provisions agreed upon ry the conference committees of the two houses last year. In the case of each or the proposed new states It is stipulated that the "sale, barter or giving away ol Intoxicating liquors to the Indians are for ever prohibited." The original proposition, as will be remembered, was that the s.ile of liquor, etc., regardless of the Indiarj, be prohibited. Further hearings on the subject will not be granted by the tern lories committee. The whole subject gone over very thoroughly during the last Congress, nothing new Is available, and the printed hearings of the last Congress are at hand and for the use of members ot the piesent House. The House will have the bill lri the hands of the Senate oefore Christmas. Senator Beverldge of Indiana, who win have charge of the Hamilton bill when It reaches the Senate, Is optimistic con cerning the chances for Its passage, lie has already done considerable missionary wcrk and professes to believe that tne necessary majority to make certain the r&Rsage of the bill has already been so cured.

Discussion of the Philippine tariff before the House committee on ways and means began this morning with the full commit tee present and with Secretary Taft, Gov. Luke E. Wright of the Philippines, Col. Clarence R. Edwards, chief of the bureau of insular affairs, and a number of repre sentatives of American sugar Interests In attendance. F. R. Hathaway, secretary of the sugar manufacturers, was the chief speaker, and for more than an hour re viewed testimony given by Philippine citi zens and officials at_ the hearings before the senators and representatives Included In the Taft party at the time of their visit to the Islands last summer. Mr. Hathaway first considered the wages of Philippine sugar laborers as shown by the hearings and declared that. Including the cost of food glv.en laborers, the pay of such workmen never exceeds 16 cents a day, as against $1.50 a day for sugar la borers In Michigan and i'2 a day in Colo rado._ In the Islands one laborer tills two and one-half acres, said Mr. Hathaway, and in the United States one man tills five acres. Although testimony was given In the islands that only one crop of sugar a year Is generally produced1, Mr. Hathaway pro duced testimony from sugar growers that two crops are frequently harvested in a year and sometimes even more. He said the freight on sugar from the islands to New York, Including insurance. Is only ^4 cents a hundred pounds, or the same as the rate from Michigan refineries to Du luth or St. Paul. Minn. D. D.

DEFENDS HIS COURSE DECLARES HE ACTED IN INTER ESTS OF PARTY HARMONY. Says That He Has No Feeling Against Mr. Hearst, But Has Given Him Good Committee Assignments. The ill feeling existing between Repre sentative Lamar of Florida an<l Repre? sentatlve John Sharp WIlllamR of Missis sippi. the minority floor leader, resulted In another scene on the floor of the House of Representatives this afternoon. After a discussion of the reference of the part of the President's message relative to federal control of Insurance Mr. Umar secured time to make a personal state ment. In a mild and temperate manner he began his story, while the House list ened with open ears and a silence so pro j found lliat a pin could have been heard to drop. Mr. I-amir r<viewed the facts In 11?o case as described in The Stir of Sunday. He be gan with the consideration of the l>avey bill Ifist year In cr immittee, with the rallins r>f a caucus and the adoption of the so called Davey bill of two sections, lie then told of the amendment of the bill In com mittee. and of the attempt of the minority leader to amend it on the floor of the House. He spoke of the minority leader's dislike of Representative Hearst of New York, and drew the infeience that it was the fact that he (Mr. Lamar) had made a s:.; <'.diary report on the Hearst Mil, that had resulted In his removal from the House committee on interstate and foreign commerce. Mostly Temperately Stated. Mr. Lamar preserved his temperate tone almost throughout his entire speech. At times his tones would ring with stron? feeling and his hand would tremble as he raised it aloft to emphasise some portions of his remarks. But he explained to the House that he had slept on the matter, that ho did not have that feeling of ex citement which nctUHit'd him when he arose in his place Monday and demanded that the democratic leader call a caucus. He reviewed In this calm manner the en tire situation and told his colleagues that ho wanted his constituents In Florida and that he wanted the entire country u> know of his position in the matter and to reallM that it was not merely a feeling of personal resentment against his removal that actu ated him. but that lie objected to the rea sons given by the minority leader for ills removal from that important committee on interstate and foreign commerce. During the course of his remarks Mr. Lamar made the point that lost year, when Representative Sullivan of Massachuse:ts had risen In Ills place and flayed Repre sentative Hearst of New York Mr. Williams did not then abject to what he was pleas??d to term In connection with the Lamar In cident the washing of democratic linen for the amusement of the republicans. Mr. Williams Takes Notes. The moment that Mr. Lamar began h!? remarks Representative Williams rose from liis place in the second section toward the rear of the chamber and walked briskly down the aisle to a seat just behind Mr. Lamar and across the aisle. The minority leader listened attentively to all that Mr. Lamar had to say and made copious no;ee? as the statement progressed, and at lt? clost? he addressed the Ilouse. Mr. Williams Replies. Mr. Williams said he had an unpleasant duty to perform, but he thought that the manner in which the gentleman from Flor ida had presented the matter to the publio in the newspapers and by his remarks on the floor demanded an explanation by the minority ieauer for his line of conduct. "The gentleman fiom Florida takes him self too seriously," said Mr. Williams. "He takes himself entirely too seriously. 1 warn him that he cannot make a national issue of a committee assignment." Mr. Williams then went on to say that In the last session of the last Congress the railroad rate question was one of th# most important tilings before the body. In this Congress, he said, emphatically, it certainly was the most important ques ll"And I should have been a fool, I should have been unutterably aslnle, X should have been unworthy of my place as mi nority leader. If I had not endeavored to secure harmony among the minority members of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce by removing two of the gentlemen who, in opposition to the other four, made the discord." Mr. Williams pointed out that he could have removed the four members to whom Representatives I>amar and Sliaokelfoi <1 were opposed, but that he thought It wil the more sensible thing to remove two ot them. He had offered Mr. Umar a place on foreign affairs, a more important com mittee than that of interstate and foreign commerce?in fact, the fourth most Im portant committee in the House?to let him down easily. s Mr. Lamar might have gone out and told his constituents in Florida that he had been promoted and no One would have known the difference; no one would have questioned it. "Oh, the gentleman takes Irmself too se riously," said Mr. William * again. "The gentleman ha sone quality In common with his uncle, the greai Jii3itce Lamar, and the latter had one quality which the gentleman from Florida does not possess. Justice Lamar possessed a superb egotism, but it was justnied. aye consecrated, by a euperb intellect." (Laughter.) Mr. Williams then re.erred to various newspaper Interviews which Mr. Lamar had given out and said that he did not intend to take any notice of the personal things said about him. Feelings Toward Hearst. Referring to his alleged dislike for Mr. Hearst, the minority leader saJd that he had no feeling on the subject. At the last session he" had given the representative from New York the only committee assign ment he had requested, that of the com mittee on labor, removing one of his own friends for the purpose. In this Congress, learning that Mr. Hearst was interested on irrigation, he had also made him a member, In addition to his labor assignment, of the committee on the irrigation of arid lands. "I never let my personal likes or dislikes interfere with my duty as minority leafier.1' said Mr. Williams. "I think that I have that reputation." (.Loud app'ause on the democratic side.) Closing Ivls remarks Mr. Williams said that what he had done was right, was just, was wise, was sensible and, moreover. ha4 been justified by the praoticaMy unanimous verdict of the democratic side of the House. (Loud democratic applause). "The gentleman asked me on the floor of the House to call a caucus In order that I might have myself rebuked," sa4d Mr. Wil liams sarcastically. "I have too much soil love to call a caucus tor that purpose. I wish to say that in my course In this mat ter I have had held malice to none and charity to all. I even promoted lh< gen tleman from Florida, but he did not see It." The House Amused. Mr William#, to Illustrate his pout, aai
