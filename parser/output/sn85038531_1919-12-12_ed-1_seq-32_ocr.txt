"Whereas tho revenues under thla admlnlatratlon In rrraeed 737.687,t18 or at the rata of fiOM per rent, compared with the (even-year terlod prior to the time It assumed office, the expenditures in. rreaeed only 164J.S35.79ll. or at the rate ef 43.49 per cent.

XL i tsiny MinK uuiwus me Tr?pper, A smart and clever as you are A mink may smarter be by far. This ia what Billy Mink said to himself as he uncovered the trap which had been set for him at the entrance to one of his favorite holes In the bank of the Laughing Brook. Of course, he was thinking of the trapper when he said it. At first Billy flew into a great rage. It mado him angry clear t the tip of his tail just to think he must now be always watching for traps where for so long thero had been no danger. At first, on discovering that trap, he had thought to go on at once up the Laughing Brook and see what more he could discover. Hut you re member that Billy was hungry and that there was a piece of perfectly delicious fish back In that hole. He knew now just how that linn hap pened to bo .here. He knew that ill Vltm. I A- - i f h to mzt . w r mr Comfort Baby's Skin With Cuticura Soap And Fragrant Talcum "It will serve that trapper right if I can get that fun," mutteed Billy. : hat trapper had put that piece of fish in there, hoping that Billy would be no eager to get In that he would be careless. The more he smelled it, the more he wanted It. "It will serve that trapper right if I can get that fish!" muttered Billy. "Perhaps it will teach V. 1 . . . 1. t 1,A ! a i ' 'i am thinks he Is. I wondor if I can etey'l tvr uuw. imi. Billy sat down and studied the trap and the entrance to the hole. The more he studied the more sure he became that he would be running a very foolish risk if he tried to step over that trap just to get a piece of flsii. Tou see, that trap had been very cunningly placed. But the more he smelled that fish the more 'he wanted it. " , Billy stroked his whiskers thought fully. Of course that didn't have any thing to do with it, but Just the same while he was stroking them he remembered something. His eyes snapped and he grinned. Way up on tho bank, between the roots of a cer tain tree, was a little tiote. It was the entrance to a little underground tunnel, and that tunnel led right down to the very hole In front of which the trap was set. It really was a sort of back door. Billy turned and In a flash had scrambled up the bank. With his keen little nose he made sure that there was no scent of the trapper up thni-a VJa .'nH BlirA that the t nnp.r had not found that little hole be- J tween the roots of that certain tree, j But though he was certain of this, , he took no chances. As he approached i that hole he took the greatest care1 to make sure that no trap was in there. There was none. Once Inside the hole, Billy ran along that little tun nel chuckling to himself. He knew that now there was no danger. He could got thaffish. He did get it. He got it -and ate It right there. Then he turned and ran out the way ha had entered. Some low that fish had tasted the best of any fish he had ever eaten. It was because he had outwitted the trapper. Next story: Billy Mink Finds Soma Queer Fences, I RIPPLING RHYMES (BY WALT MASON.)
