PRESIDENT HAY TAKE OVER ALL RAILROADS Members of Cabinet Are Try ing Him Strongly to Take Such Action Washington, Dec. 11. Members of President Wileon'a cabinet today were bringing pressure to bear on him to take over the railroads and run them for the period of the war. Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo, it was learned today on unquestionable authority, is the leading advocate of government control. He urged the pres ident to cut the eordian knot of the whole transportation problem by seiz ins the country 's . railroads and doing anything necessary to insure their ef ficient operation to win the war. McAdoo and other cabinet members pressed their views at this afternoon's , ; . if caoinet meeting, ine saints ujgu u thority stated that the president will undoubtedly go before congress with a railroad mossage. This message is to be written after today's cabinet meeting- ' It was learned that it wili include proposals which tho railroads regard as "strong measures in view or tne railroad executives' program as out lined to the president yesterday. The president is declared to nave flatly rejected the railroad terms of higher rates, dratt exemption ior rau-i way employes and government aid in obtaining financial credits. As the result the railroads war Doard sought an appointment with the pres ident to make a last stand. Ho will re ceive them tomorrow afternoon at the white house. 'Our consistent effort has been to be of servico to the nation, in time of war," said Chairman Fairfax .Harri son of the board today. 'We hope that we may be able to be of assistance to the president in respect of any action he may contemplate." Henry Ford's Views ' New York, Dec. 11. Lighter rail road equipment and a unified trans portation system will solve America's railroad nroblem, Henry Ford declared today in a statement to the New York Evening Mail. Ford asserted that steel of great strength but much less weight could 'be used by the roads to reduce operat ing costs. ''The freight car weighs as much as the load it carries," said Ford. "Gen erally, it travels two thirds full and comes back empty. Passenger trains weigh fifty to one hundred aud.tnty times as much, as the passengers in them." Ford deqjared the banking interests that control railroads are so busy t'g uring on profits that they don't know what ails their own transportation sys tems. "Kailroad management requires technically trained men who know how to run engines, machines, dig tunnels and design better equipment," he said "The railroad situation is like a man who has been so busily engaged for thirty years in working on the mod el of a new invention that ho does not tee what is going on. Now he looks up, only to find that his model is out of Uato and not good enough. 'Tho United States needs one uni fied railway system, tying together all parts of the country. "Through tho proxy sysiem, control of our railroads has passed largely to bankers living in New York ami other large cities- Ford said that lour filths or. a rail road's work today is hauling the dead weight of its own equipment and that frequent rate increases to protect stocks and bonds would not relieve tne situation. He declared that concrete highwavs should be built so trucks and. automobiles can -take over tne snort haul work which now congests rail wavs, that superfluous rail lines be eliminated, all parts of the country tapped by railroads and both pnsen- ger and lreignt rates reuucea- "America is a land or great dis tances and cheap, easy traveling and eificieut, inexpensive ireiglit service are necessities," ho said. Alley steels of high tensile strengtB can be made to reduce railroad weights Ford said. 

BRITISH AND TROOPS DIC TRETtCHES Defense Lines of Western Front Being Duplicated to - HoM Teutons By Henry Wood With The French Armies in Italy, Dec. 11. British and French troops to day are duplicating on the Italian front the impregnable Jbritisn and French treneh lines on the west front, while Germany and Austria prepare their greatest of all assaults to break through. The geographic advantages are with the enemy. The Austro-Germans now oc cupy the crest and the southern slopes of the Alps. Their positions completely dominate the entire Venetian and Lom bardy plains. Every movement of the Italian, French and British armies on the flat ground is plainly visible to the enemy. The Brent a, Piave,-Adige and other valleys traverse the. Alps and furnish doorways for an invasion which are exceedingly difficult of defense. Behind the enemy 's lines the Alps are traversed east and west by roadways nermittinir rapid transfer of troops and materials for sudden, changing attacks. They furnish great arteries of commun ication from east to west of the Piave or even from west of Lake Garda. Any success to an attack like the present one on the Asiago plateau would force immediate abandonment of the Piave' line. It would mean a retreat by the Italians either to the Adage or the Po lines. Not only does the actual tattle, line contour thus favor the enemy, but Ger many and Austria both have access to the easiest and most direct Alpine pass es for the line of communications back ,They had it that Tcner is through un- home. One of these is the historic Jiren- loss he can have his own way complete nor path between Innsbruck and Trent, fly. 

HERMAN AND TENER WILL FIGHT IT OUT Battle For Control of National League May Be Decided Today . By H. C. Hamilton (United Press staff correspondent) New York, Dec. 11 Who's who in the National league probably will be docided today. At least some progress in that direction will bo made when .' Garry Herrmann, chairman of the na tional commission, and John K. Tfner, 'president of the National league, be gin exchanging glares across the gheen table in the stateroom at the Waldoff. Garry is merely a club owner so far las his connection -with the National league is concerned. Herrmann had what some folks have called bad taste enough to call a joint "meeting of the American and National 'club owners, to follow the annual meet ings of tho big leagues. Tener feels 'that the president of .the league should nave something to say about it. There have been rumors that Tener would declare to the world his inten tion of leaving baseball unless Garry withdraws his summons to a joint talk ing contest. If he does that, it is Be lieved Herrmann will back down and take next best. Tener has shown sim (self to bo a most powerful figure in baseball. He said last summer he would not. be a candidate for re-election, but to. short time later the league magnates unanimously requested him to again ac taept the presidency and Tener said he would. So far as is known, that still is his intontion. It has been an accepted fact that the procedure would be only a matter V)f form, with congratulations already prepared for Tener. However, disquiet ing rumors were bandying aDout ifau.y It was over this way that the German armies crossed and invaded the Vene tian plains during the middle ages con flicts between Germany and the Papacy. The French and British veterans have taken over vulnerable sectors of the Italian line. They have already made themselves almost at home. Their trenches and dugouts are modeled exact ly along the lines of those from which French and British held tne lierman in vasion into Belgium and France to a standstill. General Pepino Garibaldi, who, fol lowing the American-Mexican war fought in the French foreign legion, is now fighting alongside French soldiers again. He remained in the foreign le gion, until Italy came into the war and then loined ner rorces. rue general nau two brothers killed in the foreign legion.
