MINORS SEEM LIKELY TO WIN Rebellious Leagues in Baseball World Sure of What They. Want. COMMISSION IS IN SESSION While Staggered by Demands, preme Body May -Yield. Su- New York,- Dec. 8. War clouds teeming with trouble between the dis satisfied Eastern league and American association and baseball government were somewhat dissipated when the demands of the minors were laid be fore the national commission and Na tional association yesterday afternoon. Now, despite the friendly feeling. the American association and the Eastern . league virtually gave notice of secession from the National asso ciation, and unless their demands are met a baseball war is likely. The se- ceders introduced their demands with the statement that rather thai nve friction in their organization the.a'd concluded to withdraw. This looked like news to Secretary Farrell of the National association and likewise to the commission, and the former body asked 4S hours in which to consider the demands. This was granted. Demand of Minors. In brief, peace or war hinges on the lunuwing supuiauons: Authority to conduct their own af- rairs. That the present national agreement be amended; that the draft and pur chases clauses be changed. That one of the national commission rules be changed. The demands of the American asso ciation and the Eastern league, pre sented by Attorney Kiililea to the com mission and to all members of both major leagues briefly are as follows:" Authority to conduct affairs as sep arate organizations under organized baseball. Privilege of draft from all other leagues but". National and American, limited to but one -player from each class A club. v' Alteration of draft and purchase rule making it obligatory for both major leagues to notify them of return of players to minors, and that such may be had by Association or Eastern at original drait price. Limit roster major leagues to 25 players at all times and to 20 players after May 15 each year. Privilege of drafting players from minors for 15 days following draft sea son for majors for following considera tions: ' Class A, $750; class B, $500; class C, $300. and Class D, $200. . Period of draft on association to be limited to Sept. 1 to Sept. 15 instead of Sept 1 to Oct. 15. Privilege of drafting territory from other minor league clubs. Minor Body Ilepreof nted. In order not to discriminate the Na tional association was also invited to take part and the parties met in Pres ident Pulliam's office this afternoon, where the demands were presented and discussed. Secretary Farrell, Tim Murnane, J. II. O'Rourke, M. H. Sex ton and M. Shively represented the association. After some verbal fireworks, Kiili lea, Herman and Johnson being the chief spokesmen, the moguls got down to cases and the demands of the two seceding leagues were presented by Henry J. Kiililea. All former state ments by members of either leagues were repudiated, and the slate wiped clean for the formal declaration of rights. What the Milwaukee attorney asked came as a shock to both the commission and the rest, at least so they said, and a request was made by the association for a chance to get its second wind. This was granted and the 48 hours armistice followed. It is believed that the independent section of the minors will get what they asked for, as it is not considered too radical. The commission went on record at once in regard to the draft ing rules by recommending to the two major leagues that the drafting pe riod be changed from Sept. 1 to Oct. 15, to Sept. 1 to Sept. 5.

O. Oldham, cashier of the State Savings bank, at H. B. Me Daniel, president of the Union Na tional bank, the largest banking house in south Missouri. The two men, who were present at a meeting or practically an tne oanK i officials of the city, got Into a heated argument, and Oldham, excited over rumors that the State Savings was owned by the failed institution, lost his temper. Angry words were ex changed, and McDaniel struck Oldham a blow between the eyes, staggering him. In an instant the cashier had drawn a revolver and shot at his op ponent. Bullet AII.Ne. Banker. The bullet, although fired at close range, missed McDaniel, going be tween him and a merchant who had started to interfere, and buried itself in the wall of McDaniel's private of fice, where the conference was held. Oldham, it is alleged, made an ef fort to discharge the weapon a second time, but he was overpowerd by the bystanders and the revolver taken from him. It required the combined efforts of the officials of tHo eight oth er banks of the city to restore peace between the two men. Oldham was not arrested, and It is not probable that McDaniel will ap pear against him. The rumor which caused the trouble between McDaniel and Oldham follow ed the closing of the doors of the Na tional Exchange by E. F. Rorebeck, national bank examiner. During the financial stringency a year ago the National Exchange" absorbed the Springfield Trust company, one of the largest concerns of this kind in the Ozarks. Several of the officers of the trust company went to the National Exchange in an official capacity. Re cently one or two of these officers re tired from the National Exchange and purchased large blocks of siock in the State Savings bank, of which W. E. Taley, one of the wealthiest men in Springfield, is president. E. C. Jones, a wealthy realty owner,-is vice presi dent, and Oldham is cashier. Ho mom in Circulation. When the National Exchange bank failed .' to open ita doors the rumor 1 gained circulation, as the result of - the purchase of stock by former Na- tlonal Exchange officials in the Stat? Savings bank, that the State Savings is owned by the failed bank, and this resulted in .'creating unrest amon bank depositors generally. ET frs ''' "4. : ; . J 3 

DON'T LIKE SUNDAY Certain Element Makes it Unpleasant for Evangelist When He Visits Muscatine. CUT WIRES AT MEETING Former Ball Player Forced to Go Armed, Frequent Threats Against His Life Being Made. Muscatine, Iowa, Dec. 8. "Well they have found where the dirty low lived scoundrels have cut that wire. It's the best thing that ever happened, it shows you what a degenerate white livered gang you have got here. But I want to serve notice on the mayor and chief of police right now that if any man puts a hand on me, 111 shoot him full of holes. The constitution and the law of the land gives a man a right to protect himself. My life has been threatened since I came to town and if a man lays hand on me I'll shoot him full of holes." Rev. "Billy" Sunday stood up in front of 4.000 people at the tabernacle last night and with his haggard face in relief from the light of a single smoky lamp maue this declaration. The 4,000 sitting out in the darkness caused by the sudden failing of the lights in the tabernacle, clapped their hands and cheered him mightily. I.ljlhl" Suddenly Went Out. The audience had found places at 7:30 and the service was about to start when everyone of the hundreds of electric bulbs lost its glow and the assembly was plunged in darkness. A lamp was secured from a nearby residence and until the trouble could be found and remedied, the multitude led by the choir of 400 sang the inspir ing songs which have .made the Sun day meetings famous for their 'music. It was this incident that brought forth the "I'll-shoot-him-full-of-holes" declaration from Mr. Sunday. "It just shows you," said the evangelist, "that when you go up against that whiskey gang you are going up against the dirtiest, rottenest, white-livered, red- nosed, cut-throat, scoundrelly bunch of degenerates this side of hell. That gang has no respect for any law. You ought to put a man out there by the post and if anyone tries that thin again, shoot him!" In Alwoj-n Arnifil Threats that have been made against the life of Mr. Sunday have begun to tell on the evangelist. No one who knows him believes for a moment that he fears, but the irritation of having always to be on the lookout for un seen danger, to go always armed and accompanied by a bodyguard makes worry, and Mr. Sunday seems to be worried and under a strain. In Ottumwa, Billy Sunday who never before carried anything deadlier than a toothpick, has been made by his friends to go armed always. . Two spe cial detectives "go with him from his house to the tabernacle, watch him and take him back to his home. They go where he goes. This morning at 3 o'clock they met him at the train at Ottumwa and he will be under their watchful care until he leaves for Spo kane, two weeks hence. CONVICTED LAND THIEVES GET LIMIT Frederick A.
