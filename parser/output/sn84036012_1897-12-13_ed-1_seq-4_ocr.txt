S part of the message of Prest dent McKinley that stirs to im portance the goldbug organs Is paragraph in which he remarks the Wolcott commission Isn't yet. In several of the news that- have reached Montana in that include their message com het, the remark is that the presi t's observation regarding the com lefadon's work must be classifiettd as ws. The public supposed that Mr. A, olcott's report would be made in time hur a brief summary of it in the annual meawsage, but the president wrote: 'Our special . envoys have not made their final report, as further negotla tions betweeen the representatives iof tois glovenment and the governments of other countries are pending and in ontemplatotl.1' It..eeerms' rast surprising that the president; hoiad go so far from fa(cts that are .notIqslous in his effort to get this monetary corpse upon its feet, yet the policy In the president's course ew noits .clear when account is taken of the tact that he Is helpless in the sen ate and that every little bit of strength ts can hold there helps. Wolcott, Car te and one or two other men in the sedate must be let down easy. Their muse Is lost. but they don't want the preident to proclaim that fact. So the esident remarks that further nego otiotns are "in contemplation." not hinting what they are or by what miracle they can possibly amount to anything. The Indefinite remark of the presi Gent, however, permits these gentlemen to pose a little longer as silver repub geags. It gives them a great deal of olatort, it costs the administration ab y nothing; and so the matter leanes. Hard Facts. E 

OPLE who are contemplating going to the Klondyke In the spring should put in their spare lime this winter studying the situation. Lhere are two sides to the story. A cor epoehdent of the Chicago Timese-lerald states some plain facts that are not so Jiountrging as many of the fairy tales that have been sent down from Alaska Ia rsDat months. He says that practi Jally every creek within a distance of terty miles has been 1Qecated. Yet these locatons do not exceed 1.800. There are Aight divisions and some men have lu stions in several of these, s probilbly 3li me own all the claims. But there are at present in Dawson C'ity about L,0M gold seekers, and othe*rs are oni the road In winter quarters along the trail ready to go to Dawson ine the spring. In other words, there aret about 2.10 claims and nearly 7,000 men. Moret than 2t0 of the mines located cannot he worked until wages become lower than they are at present. If 3.000 men I an find employment, the rest must re main idle or go out prospecting, a work ithat only those accustomed to hard ships can stand in the frozen nort h. !rouble about wages has already made Its appearance. The mine owners have agreed to pay $1 an hour for labor and the miners ask $t.:0 and have ct on gdled some men working for lesI 1,t attit. These facts should bie c nside-reed by people to whom the gold fields inl Alaska have a ,,onderful fascinatien. TW-here is plenty of gold there-of that Abere is no doubt. iut late '-oni."' are goig to be at a great disad\ilantage pltess entirely new fields are disc"'w eted. I his cablegram to the Nea Yeilk STimes, Harold .'rederic says that the Austrian Germans are- teo Mlaint, for the present trouble in Austrlia. It : w-orth noting, he says. that . ithin the last few months English opineion of the. Austrian difficulty has almost .e holly veered around, antl that now etcry thing is sympathizing with the · c'z+ and other Slavonic Ipeopee,.. lnc 'e thy were regarded as a lot eof ilelnra,'ll ai,e. a-jnannered ieuwaujce,. hut iJ tone has a good w.il folr ithe Austrian iermans. Mr. Frederic acr,Cunts f-.r this in part by te niatural :enta.:,ni-00 ltwueen thle Er.gi'h .t i 1' al-,,s,. and by the very unfair way in which the Austrian Germans "have played their parllamentary game." In closing, Mr. Frederic thus condemns their c nm duct: "Although always in a numeri cal minority in the country, they have for years been able to secure a ma jority in the parliament, and in all that time, so far from doing anything to pacify racial animosities, they have rid den rough-shod over all other nation alities, grinding them remorsely in the mud. Howeveir. the moment these other races secure a parliamentary majority and try to use it to do something for themselves, the G(ermans break up the parliament and refuse to recognize any of the constitutional obligations rest ing on the minority, and even declare they will join the German empire be fore they will submit to the Slavonic majority." They Are Divided. I HE opening row of last week over the assignment of topics in the president's message to the house committees is regarded in many quar ters as a showing of hands. Clearly enough. the part of the message refer ring to the Ciurrency question belonged properly to the committee on banking and currency, but it was not in the plan of Mr. Reed to let that commit tee get it---he proposed to send it to Mr. Dingley's ways and means committee. Notoriously, Speaker Reed and Mr. Dingley are not ardent advocates of the retirement of the greenback or of the Wall-street plan to put the government "out of the banking business." At the head of the committee on banking is Mr. Walker, who is a radical goldbug and who would not fall to report a measure supporting the recommenda tion of the president and of Secretary Gage, and going beyond them in the recommending of adlvanecd golditug schemes. In the programme of Speaker treed, it wouldn't do to 1l,1 the currency sutgges tions in the 1message get away. Of tle ways and means committee he feels sure-he is not so certain of his ability to control the Walker clique. The row in the house was a sure sign that the administration really has no scheme that can command the approval of the house majority; the administration is not going to be in shape to say that it would have performed its pledge to re form the currency but for the hostile senate. The divisions among the house republicans will blockade Mr. G(age's bankerst' plans. It Was a Sucess. ·,,T HE race has been a sueress fromln every point of view; from the sportsman's stand point, and from the business man's standpoint. The gate receipts will easi ly reach $60,000t, leaving the manage ment a good account." So reads the as sotiatetd prtss repolrt of New York's tix-day bicyctle race which tended Sat urday night. That is to say. the man agers of the enterprise mlladte money out of It, and the six-day retcord was broken by several racers. From still another point of view it appears to have ben a howling succetss. As an exhibi tion of telf-intlleted cruelty it attracted many thousands of additional speS'ta tors, and was in fact atibout all that could lie desired. (I)lit of tilt' New York papers thus destcribts the riatce: NI hl bll that tever was irl'ntned i lndl sliashedt in an atren was trlated so cruell ly; no crowd Ithat .eve.r watched himlt rage at his tormentors till tlhey slauglhteredl him 'ht-re'd at a petat'le mortte savage.

Their Rash Promises. W/ lIEN Mr. Carlisle was at the head of the treasury depart ment, he predicted that the revenues he was getting would bring him out without a deficit. During his term the deficit kept getting larger and larger but, until the closing months of his term. Mr. Carlisle predicted the louder that he would be all right and come out even. Slpeaker Reed, Mr. Dingle.y and others in their political circle sneered. when Carlisle talked this way. They are the people who are doing the predicting now. The deficit accumulating month after month under their tariff plan is larger by millions than the losses shown in the treasury in Carlisle's time, but they promise to come out even at the end of the year, although some of the staunchest tariff organs in the country haven't the courage to say they believe the promise can be kept. President McKinley's message as sumes that the tariff is all right. Last week Mr. I)ingley brought the repub lican side of the house to cheers when he predicted that the end of the fiscal year-that is the end of next June would find that the revenues had equaled the expenses. Secretary Gage, in his report, gives figures which plainly Indicate a de licit-it will be not less than $28.000,000. The secretary says that the Dingley bill has not been in force long enough to "determine fully its merits," but he expresses the belief that "when In full operation" It will afford "ample revenue for the ordinary needs of the govern ment." It is as plain as day, from ithe figures in the secretary's report, that the deficit is promised for 1898 and 1899. It becomes necessary for Mr. Gage to announce when the bill is to be "in full operation." To be on the safe side, the secretary must name a day so distant that the people ill be found disposed not to wait for it. Next November a new congress will he elected-that is to say, a new house of representatives. Can the administration expect to carry the country if it come up to election time with the monster deficit that now is threatened ? A Prolific Year. T liE Atlanta Constitution furnishe: the following estimates for tht year for the five great grain crops: Corn. 1.897.280,000 bushels; wheat 492.000,000; oats, 722,704,000; barley. 66,6.50,000, and rye. 27.418,00( bushels. Compared with last year there is a falling off in coml of nearly 400,000, 000 bushels, but an increase in wheat of 05,000.000 bushels, coming opportunely, toO. upon the failure of the wheat crop abroad. There is also all increase over last year of the oat crop to the extent of 15.000.000 bushels. And to their ag gregate value of more thant a thousand million dollars must be added the value of the other' crops of the farm. notably between $200,000,000 and $300,000,000 for our cottron and hundreds of millions for our fruits, vegetables, poultry and the products of the dairy. Besides all this, there are the profits off the cattle, sheep and hogs, of which we have seen. no es timate. It has been a good year for the American farmers, and at least part of the credit should be given to Provl dertne; we cannot allow the McKinley alt to monooltIize it all. The supremine court decision to be lhanded down by orvernor Smith is awaited with increasing interest. If they fail of a tw o-thirds majority in the senate, the Hawaiian annexation ists might sail for Honolulu harbor and try tlermany's little Kaio-Chou act.

MONTANA AND NTANANS. Stock on the 3 n ranges has suffered not a lit5 the past two weeks from the en5w3aad sleet storms that have prevalled aenerally in the high attitudes.

C. D. Hard of Helena has. through his attorneys, brought suit at Helena to prevent Mr. Garrett. the county treasurer, from selling for taxes the property known as the State Fair grounds. Assessor Fisher had the gall to assess it at $11,000 and the tax on that valuation calls for $181. The Fair association is a little short of cash this year and is evidently afraid that Joe Woolman might buy in the property. Butte Inter Mountain. It is said that Frank 1. Higgins of Mi'soula is c!: c ulating a petition for the appointment of associate justice, ren dered vacant by the death of Judge Buck. By many Frank Higgins', can didacy is looked upon as a huge joke, but his friends say that it is straight. From our point of view, hid appoint ment to this office is among the things that are sometimes agitated, but never happen.-Bitter Root Times. A society mention in Sunday's Ana conda Standard intimates that Frank Conley has been mixed up in a "func tion."

He never acted that way when he lived here.-Yellowstone Jour nal. Dame Rumor has it that Hon. Thomas C. Marshall of this city is about to be appolntegl United States district attorney for Montana.

While Bitter Rooters were sniffing the balmy Chinook breezes last week and our local contemporary was in dulging in visions of a hot time in the old town that night, the mercury, at Havre, in the eastern part of the state, dropped with a dull sickening thud to 40 degrees below zero. It's very pleas ant. to live in a tropical country after all.-Hamilton News. Montana has been getting some rath er undesirable climate lately because of the weather bureau at Havre.

A STRANtOg HOUtSEHOLD PRT. A Setlaad Pony 3anys that Uasiuds DlS tieteon is sauth Sendd, adlasae. Bilie Johnson is the only pony in the world who is a household pet. Bilie is an imported Shetland pony wlich Henry D. Johnson of South Bend, Ind., bought 15 years ago for his son Harry, when the latter wdes a baby. Billie now boasts of 17 years, but he is as frolic some as a colt. He hha all the privileges usually en joyed by a favorite hound, except that he has never warmed himself at the fireside or slept on the spare bed. Bqt Billy comes into the house prancing gayly up seven pairs of stairs, the click of- his small hoofs being like bail on a garret roof. Naturally he is the banner member of the circus troupe which holds high carnival in the children's bedroom. It is their chief recreation in stormy weather, and the pony, dogs, cats, pig eons and babies furnish a fascinating programme. As Billie is only 48 inches high, he easily stands or sits on an ordinary chair, with his front feet dangling against his breast like the hands of a lackadaisical lady. At the word of command he shakes hands, kisses his master and plays the corpse to perfec tion. When the babies are in the bas ket saddle he steps softly, evidently ap preciating the helplessness of his pre cious load. But when the older boys get upon his back he jumps, kicks and frolics like a stiff-legged bronco, enjoy ing the fun as keenly as his rider. He readily becomes the foundation of an animal pyramid, lying flat on the ground, while Sir Eldred, a splendid St. Bernard, lies atop him. The cap stones are Penny and Dott, two tiny blooded black and tans, weighing 25 ounces each. Billie and Sir Eldred sleep in the same stall, and when turned out in the pasture the two frolic together like playful puppies. Mr. Johnson has a passion for pets, and raised the famous St. Bernard, Major McKinley, the largest dog ever known, which was owned by General Joseph Torrence of Chicago. He keeps a large flock of homing pigeons, some of which have flown 500 miles. During Mr. Johnson's recent illness in a Chicago hospital two of the pigeons were kept busy bringing messages from the invalid. They made the flight of 86 miles in an hour and 15 minutes. When Mr. Johnson first took the pair to Chicago the male bird was five hours and a half returning home, and his mate only a little over an hour, whioh was considered strange, as he was the faster bird. Mr. Johnson watched him the next time he was set free, and saw him circle for about 10 miles and then come back to a neighboring chimney and run his head up and down as birds do when looking for something. Mr. Johnson then knew that he was wait waiting for his companion. Mr. John son loosened her and she took a straight line for the chimney, and they flew joyously away together, showing that the loyal fellow waited for her on the previous journey. Mr. Johnson's sons are away at school and have a cage of pigeons with them. It is a very sweet and senti mental fashion of sending letters, and although Mr. Johnson's private messen gers distance Uncle Sam in speed, they do not pose as competitors in the Unit ed States mail service. Unconstitutionallty of the Hawaiian Treaty. Hon. Daniel Agnew in the December Forum. There is no express power in the con stitution to acquire and incorporate a foreign territory and people into the Union. Precedents are cited to justify the annexation of Hawaii. Precedent does not amend the constitution. Amendment requires a vote of two thirds of congress and of three-fourths of the states. Consent of the senate alone is not enough. Precedent belongs to the leges non acriptas; it has no force except by usage and consent and must be precisely in point. There is no precedent to justify the admission by treaty of Hawaii. The purchase of Louisiana, Florida and Alaska are cited; but these are not in point. A purchase unauthorized by the consti tution can be justified only by an over ruling necessity for the national safe ty. To warrant the exercise of a power not found in the constitution the neces sity must be clear and imperative. Without this it is a violation of the oathl of office. The life of the constitu tion is as sacred to the people as the natural life is to the individual. What interest has the mass of the people in this treaty? None whatever. Let it be confirmed and a precedent will be established having no limit to dan ger. Folly may seize San Domingo. avarice covet Cuba and greed grasp the islands of the Caribbean sea. Variant interests will create controversies and constant struggles, ending in disunion. The Union. stretched and distended. will fall to pieces of its own weight and weakness, a prey to discord and foul ambition. Now look at some of the consequences in sight: An ocean state 2,100 miles distant from our coast, and 5.000 miles from the seat of government, is liable to mishaps. The telegraph may convey news; but no force can reach it in less than a fortnight. Land and naval forces must Is' kept there for immediate use. Incorporation confers a citizenship upon aliens not within the naturaliza tion laws, comprehending 24.407 Jappn ese. 21,616 Chinese. 31,019 Hawaiians, 8, 4S5 half-breeds, some South Sea island ers, besides 15.191 Portuguese. 2.250 Eng lishmen,.1.432 Germans and a few oth ers. It will give Hawaii two senators and a congressman, alien in character and foreign in interest, to vote on American measurts. It will confer a right to send sugar and other products into our ports without payment of du ties. It will endanger the Monroe doe trine; we cannot acquire distant ocean lands and 'yet debar Europe from American possessions. 'We incur constaht danger from the natives seeking to recover their just rights; they must be kept in subjuga lion by force of arms.
