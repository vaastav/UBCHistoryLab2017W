FARMERS ARE ALARMED AT WHEAT'S GROWTH HOG CHOLERA INCREASING Warm Weather at this Season Puts it in Danger of Being Killed. Jefferson City Ni-wa. The farmers all over the wheat yrowinu belt of Missouri arc alarmed over the rank growth of winter wheat us the result of so much warm weath er. The wheat lias grown to-a dan gerous stage, and if the warm weath er continues a few days longer, man' : fields will have grown the first joint off the stalks, which means a total j loss, for once the first joint is formed : the wheat will not grow again. For the last two weeks many farmers have been pasturing their wheat fields j hoping in this way to stay the growth of the wheat. Some of the farmers, ! unfortunately, have not enough stock. to keep the wheat down. Two or three hard freezes would do an infinite amount of good, but the weather has been so unusual for months past that it is taking a great risk to wait on a cold snap. Farmers say that there has not been such a rank fall and early winter growth of wheat in this state in a long number of years, and most of them cannot recall a tune when conditions were like they are at the present time. Loss in Pettis County 15 Per cent Seven Months in List of Letters remaining uncalled for in the post j office at Butler, Mo., for the week ending December 9th, 1913: Gentlemen; James K. Brugler. These letters will be sent to the dead letter office December 23,1913 if not delivered before. In call ing for the above, please say "Adver tised," giving date of list. C. A. Chambers, Post Master. Sedalia, Mo., Dec. 8. The virulen cy and magnitude of hog cholera in Pettus County, as proved by the in vestigation of B. VV. Murphy, head of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, the results of which were made public today, have steadily in creased since 1911, when the loss was about 8 per cent of the total number raised. The loss was almost 26 per cent in 1912 and for 1913, up to August 1 about 15 per cent. Reports from other counties in Mis souri indicate this year's losses will range from 30 to 35 per cent of the entire number raised. Through the work of the bureau, established in August, it is known that those losses for the years 1910, 1911 and 1912, conservatively valued, aggregated $1,000,000. Dr. Murphy's investigations of the origin and spread of hog cholera demonstrated that 33 per cent became infected by owners visiting infected farms, exchanging labor in the filling of silos, baling hay, etc; 33 per cent was carried by birds and dogs having I access to dead carcasses permitted to lie exposed in violation oj the law re quiring immediate burning, and 10 per cent was brought to farms by purchase of new stock. The remain ing percentage was attributed to var- ious causes such as insufficient disin fection of premises after cholera pre vailed, transmission by streams and the escape of animals from a cholera' infected farm.
