GALLIPOLIS JOURNAL. KDITBD AID MTBUSHEO BT J A TIES niRPER, 0TAt 1.50. invariably in adrauce R. L. STEWART, Astt Ebitoe. GALLIPOLIS. THURSDAY. ! : DEC. It. 1861 . yTbe annual Message of Presi dent Lincoln was read to both branches of Congress on the Sd iaat. Its length precludes us from giving it entire, and as it has been published for some days past in the Cincinnati dailies, many of which circulate in our counties, most of oar readers will ere this hare pe rused it, and willingly excuse us from its publication. It opens with a rery short and pithy congratulation on the health of the na tion, and abundant harvest of this year. Without any prefatory remarks, the President at once pitches into the af fairs of the nation in a style peculiar to himself. Our Foreign relations are briefly adverted to, and all anxiety in regard to difficulties therewith, shown to be unnecessary from the facts that the rebels received muchlesseneourage ment abroad, than was at first anticipa ted, and the interest of other nations being manifestly furthered by prompt aid in crushing out the rebellion. But the President is not unmindful that preparations for war should be made in time of peace, and therefore urges measures for defence of our coast line and lake harbors. Also for the construction of a rail road to conotel the loyal parts of Ten nessee and North Carolina with Ken tucky. This road would be of immense service and will doubtless meet with prompt attention from Congress. Why we should longer hesitate to acknowledge the Independence of Li beria and Hajti, the President don't see. On this point, many will see vari ous good reasons for not doing it. Under the present status of our govern ment, it is hardly advisable to stir up any new questions in which the "nig ger" U made the prominent feature. It is enongh now to dispose of the tangled and knotty questions surround ing him at home. Those outside of our limits can bide their time. His remarks on the Ju.liciary are sound, and if adopted will be of great advantage and convenience in the ad ministration of Justice. On the collection of claims due Northern loyal men, from citizens of seeeded States, he does not take the de cided stand we could wish to see adopt ed. He leaves the wh le matter to Congress, and by it we hope to see adopted such measures as will force the seceshera to disgorge part of the plunder, thus taken from oar fellow citizens. It is morally right. The mode of enforcing it may not be strictly legal, but those who claim equity should do equity. This, the traitors have not done, and we are therefore in favor of Judge Freese's mode of enforcing collections. The President touches lightly upon the power of the Court of Claims, but directly to the point. As it now stands, the labors of the Court are very often fruitless. Make its judgment final, and end all useless litigation. The business will be hereafter largely increased by this war, and now i the time to place the Court cn a firm bsis, and some thing more certain and conclusive, than a voluntary arbitration. He recommends the re annexation of that portion of the Dis'rict of Co Iumbia which was r-liiiqui.-hed to Yir ginia. This is right if only to place the refractory village of Al undris un der loyal rule, and as much of Virgi nia territory aa possible. She is in I fair way to be dismembered, and anv fragment annexed to loal States is so much rescued from treason and des potisra. The oiilj remaining topic of interest is the "Contraband question," and It is cot easy to solve, either for the Txesi dent "or any other man." The fact that it has already caused fin outbreak in the Cabinet, and a dis cord where all should be harmony, is a sufficient excuse for leaving it to Con gre68, as the President has done. We did expect to see the Adminislra tion adopt tome line of policy on this vexed question, which would enable the public to see what object they had in view, and whether the perpetuity of the Union and slavery was the design of this war, or the preservation of the Union at all hazards, and let slavery lake care of itself. It ia certainly the bull that has madly attempted to butt the train off the track. If in the eon test it should itself be thrown over the embankment and the train move on, we say "sarved 'em right," On the whole the President has evi dently had an eye to the welfare of the Union men in the rebel States, and by very possible means endeavored to r of those who wish to return to their al legiance. HU honesty of purpose n manifest, bat we doubt the policy. Time will how. . J3 Mr. Pmslzt Mabtih, living near the mouth of Raccoon, had his at tention drawn on Monday morning, to a riderless horse with saddle and bridle on, which bore the appearance of hav ing been in the water, and his suspicions being aroused that some unfortunate strsnger had attempted to ford the creek and lost his life, led him and others to investigate the matter. Tbey found where tha horse entered the water, and where he came out on the opposite side. The creek was dragged between those points, but no body was found. Since writing the above, we learn that the horse belongs to a Mr. Watson who had loaned it to a school teacher in his neighborhood. We could not learn the name of the man supposed to be drowned. Coworbssiosal. The President's Message was sent in Tuesday noon. Resolutions passed the House by a large majority, confiscating the slaves of rebels. Resolutions were also adopted. that the President be requested to order Mason and Slidell to be confined in felon's cells until Cols. Corcoran and Wood should be released from their barbarous treatment, and should re' ceive the attention due to prisoners of the United Slates. It is evident that work will be done promptly, and that retaliation will be one of the measures to bring the rebels to terms. Tbe Triasubt Rkport. Secretary Chase'a report is finished. It is said to contain a more profound and original discussion of financial questions than the treasury reports for many years past. It estimates the public debt in 1 863, at the present rates of expendi ture at eight hundred millions. It will recommend a tax upon promissory notes, and also upon bank notes in order to remove them from circulation, and substitute the currency of the United States, and deeds of eon vevanee, a duty upon liquors and tobacco, and an inciease of those upon tea, coffee and sugar. It touches the Slavery question in a paragraph advising the confiscation of rebels property, as a means of rev enue. He excepts slaves, because the United States cannot become a slave holder, but he recommends emanei pation and the employment of the liberated negroes in the service of the Government. Death or Old Residents. Two of the oldest residents of Gallipolis died during the past week. Mr. Mat thew Walxer, on Saturday last, in the 73d year of his age, and Mr. Peter Crapdu on the following Monday even ing, aged 82 years. Mr. Walker was a native of Berwick. Scotland, and emi grated to this country and settled in Gallipolis ia the year 1817, where he resided up to the time of his death. Mr. Chapdu was a native of France and came to Gallipolis about the year 1810. His remains were followed to the grave by the Masonic Fraternity, of which he was a devoted member. They were honest men. 3TFrom the Richmond Examiner we quote prices of provisions in that market at wholesale prices. Baron (hog round) 23 to 26 cents. Butter 45 to 50, very scarce. Corn meal 80 to 85. Candles 20 cents. Coffee, none in market. Hay 3 1 25 per cwt Pig Iron 845. Leather 65 cents, demand far beyond supply. Pepper 70 to 75 cent, very scarce. Salt, 8 9 60 to 810 per sack, dee. Ac. At Lynchburg, salt ia np to 820 per sack. No wonder Flovd and Wie wanted a foot-hold in the Kanawha Valley. Happy country where such prices prevail. 7The Sorghum crop in Illinois this year is estimated at 81,000,000, and enough of it to keep down the price of cane sugar and molasses. In La Salle county, 2250 barrels were made of sorghum syrup. In the State of Iowa, large quantities were made 1so. In Indiana almost enough to supply the entire demand. Thus are we becoming every day more indepen dent of the South and her manufac tures. Dr. W. S. Wortmah. This eminent physician informs us that he will be in Gallipolis on Tbcrsdat, December 19M, and those wishing to consult him will have an opportunity by calling at the Valley House on that day. Dr. W. is very successful in the treatment of lung diseases, as hundreds in this county can attest, and it will be gratifying to many to learn of his coming. His patients accord to him skill and success in the treatment of all forms of chronic dis ease. Dog Lost. -A black and white spotted pop of the "English Coach" breed, atrayed from Mr. W. H. Pxe ples' residence on Third street a couple of weeks since. Any person returning her will be suitably rewarded. I XrThe lot of a soldier ny be sj hard one, but if there is anything eon- nected with the service still more so, ...... . , . rt is the lot of a Government horse or)the mule. We were forcibly reminded of this fact by the appearance of a few hundred that arrived at our wharf last week, on board the Gleenwood and Mary Cook. They not only exhibit the horrors of war and its infernal destruc tion of life and property, but -also a carelessness on the part of teamesters, wagon-masters, dec, that is most repre hensible. Tbe terrible effects of star vation manifested by those Irving skel etons, are too apparent to deceive any one. Excessive labor baa not brought it about. Many of them have no marks of harness or anything showing that they ever were worked at all. Indeed we have been credibly informed that large numbers of horses sent up Kana wha, had been tied up to trees or picket ed out without food or water for days at a time. Men who would suffer such a state of things, ought to be taken out some fine morning and shot, without distinction as to his standing, whether as an officer or driver. There must be now in our county over one thousand head of these "Rosinantes," all from "Rosencrans"' division. Aside from mercy to poor dumb brutes, the cost of their keeping may be of benefit to our farmers. Whether the Government would not hsve saved money by shoot ing or giving away one half of them, and selling the other half for what they would bring, is a question not very dif ficult to solve. Should the war close in the spring not one in ten would then sell for the cost of keeping. But so we go, and "how not to do it" seems to be the order. Capt. Boogebs, the gentle manly Quarter-master at this post is do ing his utmost, under the circumstances by which he is surrounded, to save these horses. If a little discretionary power to sell, exchange, or even give away some of them were allowed him, we are confident it would prove bene ficial to the Government. As it is he ean do nothing but suffer them to pine away and die, in consequence of the crowded condition of the stables, where as if they were in other hsnds, they might in many cases be saved. We hope to see this point attended to. Rapid Bridge Bcildiko. The Fif teenth New York Regiment, says a Washington correspondent, this after noon made a first attempt at pontoon bridge building, near their camp on the eastern branch of the Potomac. The pontoons of India-rubber were inflated, and a bridge of one hundred and eighty eight feet long laid in thirty three minutes. Fifty men then crossed at or dinary and double quick time, and on the run, and horses walked over. The regiment is supplied with a pon toon train and tools for constructing bridges and fortifications. tW Jefferson Davis by his last mes sage, did the Union cause great service, by declaring that he had appointed Mason and Slidell embassadors of the Southern Confederacy. " But for this admission, it would be hard if not Im possible to show the fact, and appear ances would be sgainst us. In conse quence of neglecting to search their per sons or bagcrage, all papers going to show their mission were destroyed, and they might have set up the plea that they were only passengers on their way to Europe. Luckily for Capt. Wilkes, j . i - a J : : i : T a t i i nnu uir nuiiuuiMraiiun, avin nasi . himself furnished the most conclusive ' proof of this all important fact. Thus r . ... . . ! ty with England, on this or any other point, has signally failed. Let us hope for its continuance, at least until all ac counts are squared with Davisdom, then if the British lion feels disposed to show his teeth, our gallant volunteers will pay their respects to him, by wsy of "easing off" their return to civil life. ryWe noticed with pleasure the Government teams under charge of Mr. Wing ate, busily engaged one day last week in bauling gravel upon the square and side-walks, when it was necessary for the convenience of the U. 9. officials-' If all the wagon-masters were as alien-1 live to their duty ss our friend Wingate, I would be a happy time for the horses at least. Although busily engaged eve- j ry day, the teams under his charge look as fine as though kept in a band box. He evidently understands his business as well as duty, and his drivers also. Seeing the effects of the teams upon our wharf and streets, he is willing, when they have nothing else to do, to make all possible repairs by hauling gravel, cinder, dec. This is so different from the course pursued by most of our ar my men, that we cannot refrain from bestowing upon it our hearty commen dation, and trust it may be continued. 3TA mistake occurred in the sched ule returned by H. H. Butler of Hun tington township. It should read Jas. Wright one pair socks; Mrs. Wm. Potter one blanketand two pair socks. Report of thb Skc-itabt or rat I'timob. This report furnishes some 'imtig tatiaties regarding the op w erations of the General Land Office, bnsioeM rf states, has been sensibly affected br the decline of business throughout the country. On the 30th of September, 1861, there were 55.555.595 25 acres of the public landa which had been sur veyed but not proclaimed for public sale. The lands surveyed and offered at public aale previous to that time, and those subject to private entry, amoun ted to 78,662,735 64 acres, making an ggregate of public lands surveyed and ready for sale, of 134,218.330 89 acres. The net income from sales du ring the last fiscal year will hardly reach the sum of 8200,000. -The grants of swamp and overflowed lands to the States' have absorbed a large amount ot valuable lands and caused a heavy drain upon the treasury. The claims of the several States cover an Sgregate ol 67,895.577 40 acrea. The bounty land warrants and scrip issued under different acts of Congress, previous to September 30, 1861, em brsce an aggregate of 71,717,172 acres ol land. The propriety of issuing bounty land warrants to tbe volunteers is, tbe bee retary says, subject of discussion. and must be determined by Congress He expresses his disapproval of such grants, for the reason that a warrant for 160 acres to each volunteer engaged in the service would absorb over one hundred millions of acres, and destroy all hope of derivin? any revenue from the public lands for many years, at the aame time affording but little benefit to our soldiers. Our Indian affairs are described as being In a very unsettled condition, the spirit of rebellion having been instilled into a portion of the Indian tribes by emissaries from the insurrectionary States. The payment of annuitiea to these Indians has been suspended. The insurrection of the Southern Stales haa affected the Patent Office to a very great extent. The receipts from January 1 to September 30, 1861, were 8102,808 18; and the expendi tures were 8185.594 05, showing an ex cess of expenditures over receipts of 882,785 87. During the correspond ing period of tbe last year the receipts were 8197,348 40, being 894,840 22 more than the receipts for the same part of this year. Tbe Secretary expresses his gratifi cation at the unprecedented success of the means taken for the suppression of the African slave trade. Five vessels have been seized, tried, and condemned by tbe Courts. One slaver has been taken on the coast of Africa with about nine hundred negroes on board, who were conveyed to the republic of Li beria. One person has been eonvicted at New York as the captain of a slaver, having on board eight hundred cap tives, snd two others, (matesof a dif ferent vessel,) and another onrat Bos ton for fitting out a vessel for the slave trade. In the first named ease the pen alty is death; in the other it ia fine and imprisonment. Hitherto convictions under the laws prohibiting the slave trade have been very rare. The report closes with a statement of the condition, financial and otherwise, oi tne amerent public institutions in the District. WAR
