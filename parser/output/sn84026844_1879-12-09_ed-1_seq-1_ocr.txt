It provides that the President, with the consent of the Senate, shall appoint a commission of five persona to enquire and report to the extent to which machinery and labor saving processes have entered into the production and distribution of products in geueral, and the consumption among the people, to the displacement of manual labor. Also, whether any causes are in operation to bring about ownership and cultivation of lands In large tracts instead of small forms and homesteads. Also, as to the condi* tion of persons employed in agricultural, mechancial, manufacturing and mining labor in this country, and especially whether any causes are at work to change for the better or worsojthe condition ofsoch persons; their hours of labor, the education of their children, and the proportion received by them of the protits of the occupations in which they are engaged. The commissioners are to hold office for two years;receive an annual salary of $4,000 each, and be allowed their expenses of travel; have authority to employ a secretary and three clerks, and report to Con* gress annually through the Secretary of the Interior. 

EDUCATION Of T1IK COLORED RACK. The bill introduced by Senator Bailey to aid in the education 01 the colored race, recites in the preamble that $510,000 have recently been recovered back into the U. 8. Treasury from appropriations for the pay and bounties of colored soldiers, which remained unclaimed after seven years, nvinif tn iha imnnulhllitv nf dlimvArino Ihe claimants, and asserts tbat under the circumstances the| colored people should have the benelit of the said money lor their educational improvement and elevation. The bill therefore directs the Secretary of the Treasury to invest 1510,000 in T7; 8. registered four per cent bonds, to be apportioned in equal parts to ihe following institutions for the education of the colored people, viz: The Howard University, Washington, 1). C.; Hampton, Virginia, Normal and Agricultural Institute; The Kisk University, of Nashville, Tenn.; Tho Atlanta (Ga.) university, and Straight University, of New Orleans. The trustees of tbeee institutions are to be entitled to use flio interest on the bonds in inch manner as in their judgment will beet promote the ends lor which they are chartered, but the principal of the bonds is to be Inalienable. THE DETROIT IUVEK DE1DOK AMD TUNNEL. The Secretary of War transmitted to the Senate, this morning, a copy ola report of the Board of Engineers, relative to the Detroit river bridge. They recommend that ia case the right to construct be granted vessels shall have the right of way. The Board mention the fact that they were directed by Qen. Sherman to enquire into lod report whether for railroad pnrpoeea the Detroit river can be bridged or tunneled at Detroit, or within one mile aboveor below said city, in such a manner as to accommodate the large trade and commerce crossing the river at that poiut, and without material injury to the navigation of said river, a good andsnfficient tug beingalwtys kept by the bridgeownera to assist any craft when required. They convened at Detroit the Brat Thursday In October, 1879, and were required by lien. Sherman to complete and submit their report and recommendations to the Chief of Engineers before December first. The first fire days of of the session were occupied in bearing statements and arguments of persons favoring or opposing the construction of the the bridge or tunnel, and then at the ur gept request of all the parties interested the board adjourned to enable tlmtn to col lect statistics bearing upon Uie subject On the lath of Novenibertboy reassemble and prom .It-1 to consider matters referret to them. The difficulty they met with at the atari r la tlms briefly stated: "At Detroit two im msnu stream* of cqmmorue come Ink direct interference, namely: one by water and the other by railroada. The problen before the board wan to bo arrange, by either bridge or tunnel, that theee uiighl cross each other with tne leut injury tc both, and In such manner aa to accommo date the railroad tralllc and at the same do no material or undue injury to the Interests of navigation. The magnitude of these conflicting interest* at this point may lie rtallied from the oillclal statement* marked in the re, port, whickihow that the nulnber of veaUble ..r IV.I lighthouse during the fincal year ending June 30,1870, was 22,150, ami the businew of the railroad crosaing the river at Detroit during the year was as follows: Passengers, 120,113: passenger care, 12,258; baggage care, 3,783; freight care, 104,359. The question of bridging or tunneling Detroit River had been agitated for a number of years, aud numerous plana and projects had been presented for consideration, but the joint resolutions con* tained no inatructions to the Board to consider the mode and plans of construction, details of operation or the matter of coat. These subject*, except in a general war, are not referred to in the report. The report of the Hoard of Engineers, appointed in 1873 to investigate this same subject, is alluded to. The former board stated, among other things, that no bridge with draws should be tolerated. The board of 187i>, in their conclusions on this point says: "There is probably no difference of opinion about these conclusions except as to the oue referring to a bridge with draws. The form of fridge considered inadvisable by the former noard had openings 100 feet on the oast side, the remainder to be built upon piers of masonry 200 feet apart, and it was believed that the draw openings of 106 feet were greater than was considered practicable. Draws of more than 200 feet nave been since constructed, and it is now proposed by bridge builders of high reputation to construct them with openings of] 300 feet on each side of a Divot nier. or I 400 feet between two piers. Willi reference to tratlic across the proposed river bridge, ;the Board finds that with the present traffic there will be ample time during the intervals between the passage of vessels. to move all trains across the bridge. There will occasionally be delays, but the rtilroads can accommodate their time tables to compensate for any ordinary delays. They say, however, that in case the authority to construct the bridge should be granted by Congress it should be distinctly provided that vessels have the right of way except when moving trains are passing over the bridge. The Board, although unanimously of the opinion that a tunnel offers the most complete solution of the problem, presents no argument in favor of it. PROPOSED CHANGES AS TO TUE ELECTION OP PRESIDENT. The House Committee on the State of the Law, respecting! the ascertainment and declaration of the election of President and Vice President have not yet held a meeting, owing to the absence from the city of two members of the committee. A hill In nmvidn fnr and !?*? counting of votes for tho President and Vice President, and the decision of the questions arising thereon was reported and referred back to the committee the last session, will at an early day be again reported to the House with a view of having a day set for its consideration. A sub committee of the Senate Committed has also under consideration and will report favorably to tho full committee a resolution introduced by Kepresentative Bickuelh which contemplates an amendment to Constitution to abolish the electoral college and provides for the election of the President and Vice President directl ly by tho people. Representative Pound has prepared and will introduce at the earliest opportunity a joint resolution proposing an additional amendment to the Constitution, providing that the'.President shall be elected for' ft teriii of six years and be thereafter ineligible, and -that the members of Congress will be elected for a term of three years.

Washington, December 7.?The Democratic managers have not yet found any way to prevent the reopening of the questions of the extra session, except through a complete surrender on the bill appropriating money for the marshals, li the former restrictive clause is retained, or anv limiting clause in it* nlace. the Re publicans will be sure to force a heated and prolonged debite over It; so at present the question under consideration by the Democrat* is whether It Is expedient to surrender unconditionally or not. TOLKN DOCUHUH. Secretary Sherman says there la no doubt of the guilt of Barringer, discharged from the Treasury for stealing the message and report. Barringer was a form maker and received a salary of fifteen hundred dollars. Hia part of the swag, Sherman thinks, was one thousand dollars. Eeferrin: to the theft, the Capiial to-day says: "This is called journalistic enterprise. Plain, common-sense sort of of people call it tboft, and have not the highest regard for the men who received the stolen goods, or the poor devils who, for a consideration, were willing'to stand in the light oi snetk thieves.

Ho Indiana appeared at the agency * until Saturday, but teem to have been en- It gaged at Ourar'a in conducting the wildcat t! dancea and in making speeches. A mtu who buiu.irom me agency 10 uuray 8 Willi j] feed for the horses of the Indians and h discovered from the noLie on the inside * that tho Indians were greatly excited. |J What he saw of them were bedecked in 0 feathers and war paint, and ho was so tl frightened that ho turned back and did not C> deUrer the hay. Saturday at 12 o'clock * tho Utea came into the agencv and took w seats inside of the agencv building. Jack, w Uolorow, and twelve other White River f0 Utea, and, of course, Onray being among the Indians present. When the Indians ^ and the Commissioners had taken their w seats, Gen. Hatch addressed the Indiaus, ttC setting forth the full demands of the Com- jj mission; its right to make the de- pi tnand, and the patience already exercbsd Ji, with the XJtes. r*To-day," he said, "is your last chance. We will wait no longer. \V8 want your final answer and we want no ti evasions." A list of the Utea charged by the agency women with taking part in the At massacre was then read, and the question put by Hatch: "Will you surrender the men whose names are in this paper to be n? tried and the guilty punished and innocent . acquitted?" The question was put twice, 10 and after consultation, evasive answers re- th turned both times. in; vy nen mo question wu repeated three aj] timofl, Ouray replied without consulting the other Utea: "How do we know that these Indians you name were at Wliite ag River at the time of the massacre; or even ce: if they were there, we do not know that M they were concerned in it. These women , mentioned the names which came iiret to "a their lipe, whether they know them to be 25 so or not. We cannot depend on what tic they say." ce "That Ib what we depend on," eaid ha Hatch. bu Adams then addressed the Indians, Yi making a speech over an hoar's dotation, sei saying, among ol)ier things, that the ha Commissioners did not want to punish Bi Colorow, Jack and others that took part ho in the Thornburgh fight, but the cowardly cu dogs who participated in the massacre of th. unarmed men at the agency. He closed tic by saying, "We want those Utea aud we wc will have them." cai The Indians held a consultation in a no low tone of voice among themselves, bat sh none seemed inclined to reply at all. th' When Hatch rose and asked if the guilty Indians were to bo surrendered, sayiug w< he had made his last appeal, 110 one Be moved or spoke for a few moments. When Colorow lighted a big pipe, "the pipe of An peace," each Indian present drew his J knife and laid it on his knee.

Instantly every In- in( dlan present dropped his hand to his hilt l' and laid his hand on his knile or pistol. ? The whites did the same, and the two ? parties stood ironting and defying each ,t other for some moments, each wailing for E* the other to make a forward move. There <j were but six white men while there were Tot twenty?five Indians In the room, and -J fifteen soldiers in an adjoining room. r Finally, Ouray spoke: "Wecannotde- lot liver up to you those Indians, unless they 1 are tried in Washington. They must not be tried in Colorado; Colorado people are all our enemies, and to give them up to be tried in this State would be to sur- Et render them to be hanged.

This was said with ereat arrogance and boldness. Ouray said it would take about *1 a week to bring men in. Hatch told him ha be would accept the proposition, so far as th bringing participants in, but as for taking 0f 1 them to Washington, be had to telegraph \v for permission to Schurz. Colorow and flc Jack at once dispatched to bring in the p< 112 named, including Douglass and Peraine, saying he would be back in five days. After they had taken their departure, i Ouray again spoke, reiterating his statement that the Utes could not get justice in Colorado, and could only get it in __ Washington. 41 Yon three, meaning Hatch, Adams and legal adviser Valoie, tei "are all my enemies. I am one against lai three. You "hate me; you are all Colorado m or New Mexico men, and a French devil.

Itora IntcUltencor. 1 learned to-day, through your columns d otherwise, of the outrageous charac- ne r or the scone at tbe Opera House on it SabbatU evening, and note your re- j|j arks on the impropriety of granting a [e irmit to such a performance. I agree hi ith you entirely, and regret the occur- at n?e exceedingly. I was lied to and de- ol ived in the following manner: ar One evening last week a person, repre- M nting himself as agent for a Prof. Cooke, ki lied at my house and said that he desir- fu i to know if a license must be paid to e city for a lecture on Spiritualism, to i delivered by Prof. Cooke, on bbath evening; that ho bad call1 on Clerk updcgraff, who had ferred him to me. 1 asked Ll m what was tbe character of the lecture, G' id if it was suitable for a Sabbath day. He ic plied that it was of a religious kiud; that ?j. was appropriate to the day, and had sen given on that day in many cities, and 10 tat no license had been charged in many m them. I then asked hijn if an adisaion was charged. He answered that P? lly a small aum (10 cents) ?u"charged aj pay expenses. 1 told him that by our In dinaoce all playa, for admission to which >> oney was charged most have a license. '* id gave Ilim the uaual form of printed irmit to have licenae on payment ol the '<j ix aaseaaed by ordinance, and heard 01 thing more ol the matter until to-day. oj have been outrageoualy imposed " pon, and ahall try to uae greater \l trc hereafter. It haa not ,been unusual T ir lectures to be given on the Sabbath n ay on Temperance and other aubjecta, c ith a email charge (10 cents) to pay exenaea. So tax haa been exacted of these, ecause they were for tbe benefit of home n jcietles, and I supposed that the clerk 'as only In doubt aa to whether this case c 3ooke'a) ahonld be placed on the aame >oting, and allowed without license. 0 After writing the above, I have aeen t! !lerk L'pdegralf, and he fully iconfirma t rhat I have written relating to him, and g sya that the agent repreaented to him also, g bat the lecture wu a religions one, anu u hat he had not been charged license in t otne cities. r A.
