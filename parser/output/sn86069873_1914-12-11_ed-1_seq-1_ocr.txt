THE QUARANTINE SITUATION. The committee composed of Messrs. Tkos. H. Clay, Jr., Jos. M. Hall, Robt. Meteer and Jas. H. Thompson, ap pointed at the mass meeting in this city Saturday, went to Frankfort, j-Tuesday, where they conferred with Mr. J. W. Newman. Chairman of the Live Stock Sanitary Board, in regard to the quarantine being maintained on Bourbon county stock. After the exact situation with re gard to the pervalence of the foot-and-mouth disease in this county was thoroughly and plainly reported by the committee, they were informed by Mr. Newman that -Bourbon county was neither in the Federal or State quaran tine area, but was only in what was termed the "suspicious area." The cattle belonging to Mr. P J. Millett, were again inspected by two Federal inspectors, Drs. Stingly and Gibson, and no action was taken to destroy them. The cattle will be inspected again in a tew days to finally determine whether or not they will be destroyed. jThere seems to be grave doubt whether or not the cattle are seriously affected. It is probable that the quarantine on Mr. Millett's place will be lifted within the next ten days. The lifting of the embargo will be grea t news to the stock raisers and dealers t)f the county. Dr. R. J. Lawton, of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry, who is in charge of the work of fight ing the foot-and-mouth disease in Bourbon and adjoining counties, has issued a request that cattle owners of Bourbon county report at once any suspicious or suspected cases of the disease among the cattle of this coun ty. Dr. Lawton says: "If the stock owners of this county will report at once any cases of a sus picious nature I will send an assistant or will come myself at once to investi gate the case. I fe-f satisfied that if the cattlemen and farmers will give us the necessary co-operation we will be able to rid the State of this dread ed malady." Dr. Lawton asked that his telephone number, 2304, at his office in the Fay ette National Bank Building, in Lex ington, be published, where he can be reached at any time during the day or night. Thirty-nine cattle belonging to Dr. Ben. D. Knox and R. F. Offutt, in Scott county, infected with the hoof-and-mouth disease, were shot Wednes day morning1 by Federal Inspector Fred Casey, and were immediately buried in a big trench and covered with quicklime.
