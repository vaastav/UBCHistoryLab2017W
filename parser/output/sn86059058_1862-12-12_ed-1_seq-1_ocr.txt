Financial and f oinmcrolal Summarj for the Past Week. There lias been an active demand for moiinv, but none of that stringency which has prevailed during the pork sea son in other vears exists in the market, and all acceptable paper offered has been taken at 10 per cent,.; but iu some i cases 12 per cent, had to be paid. The ; week closed with a slight falling off in the ; demand, however, and an easier market. The minds of those who deal iu money ' and public securities have been a good ' deal agitated by the President's Message j and tiie reports of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of War, and the price of gold and public securities has flaetmted, to a considerable extent; and gold closes higher. The truth is, mat ters do not look so well cither in the field or the Ciiliinet. The revelations made , in the report of the Secretary of War, are discouraging in the extreme; for if it is true, that in Union there is strength, then the converse of this expresses the position of the affairs of the Nation. It seems to be an admitted fact that com petition and jealousies, personal dislikes and personal malignity, hud culminated j in positive mutiny on the part of some, if not all the leaders of the army in Vir ginia, and disobedience ot orders of su- ; perior oflicers had become the rule, al most; and such conduct passed unno- : ticed, in many cases. A change has ta ken place, it is true, but this change finds us in midwinter, when a successful cam paign seeids extremely difficult, if not impossible. It is these things which are malting gold go up, and producing agi-' tatio.i in financial matters in the leading mnrkels. Exchange on New York and the other ! Eastern cities was a shade firmer at the ' close, and dealers generally bought at J discount and sold at par. The quota- i tions for coin and exchange a the close, j last evening, were as follows:

The weather has been cold and frosty and as favorable tor pork packing as could have been desired. The receipts of hogs have been large, but the demand has been fully equal to them, and prices gradually improved. The receipts are now greater, up to this date, than in any previous season, but the impression is that, owing to the high price of corn, farmers are hurrying their hogs to mar ket, and that the season will close eurlier than usual. The fact that hogs are not as well fatted as they might be, seems to corroborate this theory. It seems quie probable, however, that the number of hogs which will be packed here the present season will exceed the number packed last season, very considerably. There can be no doubt that the number of hogs in the country is large, and that the average weight will be up to the usual average of other seasons, not mak ing that of last season as the standard. Yesterday packers were well supplied. Generally speaking, they were not iu the market, which gave it rather a quiet as pect; but it was none the less firm, and prices were fully maintained, the range being '!' to &4 6" for hogs averaging 170 to 200 lbs. The sales were: Ton averaging Ml lba i;2! Ifil iJUU 4 3i' 4'tl " 210 . 4 :.o 3SO " 2I"J 4 40 2O0 " ISO 4 25 Extra heavy hogs were scarce, and anxiously sought for at 4 60 to $4 65.

Old mess pork has been held at $11, and new, which has been packed to some extent, at $12 50 to $13, but there have been no sales of importance. Lard has been in good demand at Of, in tierces, and 0 in kegs, but a portion of the time it is held higher, and at this close, it would have heen difficult to buy at the quotations, owing to the advance in New York. This seems to be a favor ite article, and outsiders are buying it on speculation to a considerable extent. Manufacturers are buying freely, and paying 8J8J for head and gut Green meats have been in good de mand, as regards sides and hams, but shoulders have not been bought freely. We quote shoulders at 3J3J, which is above the views of buyers a shade; sides 55i for rib and clear, and hams 5(7i) b, the latter rate for light The de mand for light hams has been active and pressing all the week. A fair business has been done in box meuts at 6j(S;7e for short clear and mid dles, 6k for short rib, 6c for long do, and 5 J Co 5 for Cumberland. One of the English packers sold largely in X-w York, rather than ship to Liverpool. We FRIDAY MORNING, did not hear of any transactions in old meats, either in bulk or smoked. There has not been much animation in the market for flour and grain. Whisky ruled firm at 3-. Cooperage and coop ers' stuff dull, and, in some articles of the former, lower. The grocery market continues exceed ingly dull, and prices of sugar and mo lasses very irregular, so much so that anything like accurate quotations cannot be given. Holders seem anxious to re alize, but the demand is of the most lim ited nature. The quotations, so far as they can be given, will be found in our market report. Salt is dull and prices declining. Liv erpool sold at $2 252 50 per bag. and Turk's Island at 55c. Kanawha is down to 62J for the inside lots, but outside lota are ottered at 55c. The demand for all kinds is li"ht.
