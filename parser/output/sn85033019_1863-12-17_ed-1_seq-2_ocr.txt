Of those who were slaves at the begin ning of the rebellion, full 100,000 are now in the United States military service, about one half of which number actually bear anas in the ranks of the United States forces, giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgents’ cause and supplying the places which otherwise must. Us filled with .so many white men. So Car as tested it is difficult to say they are no fas good" soldiers as any. No servile in surrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of emancipation of the blacks. These measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and cotemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved. At home the same measure have been fully discussed, supported, criticised and denounced, and the annual elections followingarchighly encour aging to those whose special duty it is to bear the country through this great trial. Thus we have the reckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past. -t rr.vx ron reconstruction. Looking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption of the National authority within the States wherein that authority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a Proclamation, a copy j of which is herewith transmitted. On ex amination of this proclamation it will ap pear, as is believed, amply justified by the Constitution. True, the form ot an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. A man is only proffered a pardon, in case he voluntarily takes the oath, the Constitu tion auUv r'.zcs the Executive to grant, on terms fully established by judicial and other authorities. It is also proffered that if in any of the Status named a seat of Govern ment shall be, tn the mode prescribed, set Up, such government shall be recognised and guaranteed by the United States, and that under it the State shall, on constitutional conditions, bo protected against invasion and domestic violence. T he constitutional obligation of the United States, to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government, and to protect the State in the cases stated, is explicit and full, but why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State Govern ment set up in its particular way ? This section of the Constitution contemplates a ease wherein the element within a State, favorable to a Republican Government in tho L nion, may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile external to, and oven within the State, and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing. An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State Gov ernment, constructed in whole or in prepon derating part from the very element against whose hostility and violence it is to be pro tected, is simply absurd. There must be a test by which to separate opposing elements so as to build only from the sound, and that test is a sufficiently liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recan tation of his former unsoundness. But if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body, an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and to the Union under it, why not also to the laws, an . the proclamations in regard to slavery ? These laws and procla mations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in (he suppression of the rebellion. To give their fullest effect, there had to be a pledge for their maintainance. fn my Judgment they have aided, and will further aid, the cause for which they were enacted and set forth. lo give up this principle would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and astounding breach of faith. I may add, at this point that, while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall T re turn to slavery any person who is free b} r the terms of the proclamation or by anv act of Congress, i' or those and other resolutions it is thought le.-d that the support of these provisions shall be included in the oath, and it is be lieved that the Executive may lawfully claim 1 return for pardon and the restoration of forfeited rights, which he has a clear constitutional power to withhold altogether, o* giant upon the terms which he shall deem wrsest for the public interest. It should bo observed also that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abro gating power of legislation and the supreme judicial decision, I he proposed acquiescence of the Nation al executive any honorable temporary state arrangement [or the freed people, is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion which must, at best, attend [?] all classes of a total revolution of labor throughout the revolted States. It is hoped that the already deepty afflict ed people in those states may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction to this extent, if this vital matter be left to themselves, while no power of the National Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition. The sugges tion in the proclamation as to maintaining tho political frame-work of the States or what is called “reconstruction,” is made in the hope that it may do good without the danger of doing harm. It will save labor and avoid great confusion. But why any proclamation now upon this subject ? The question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be de layed too long, or be taken too soon. In some States the elements of a resumption seem ready for action, but remain inactive, apparently for want of a rallying point or plan of action. Why shall A adobt the plan of B, rather than B that of A ? and if A and B should agree, how can they know that the General Government here will re spect their plans? By the Proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. Tins may bring them to action soon er than they otherwise would. The objection to a premature presenta tion of a plan by the National Executive consists in tho danger of committal on points which could be more safely left to future dcvclopcment, Care has been taken to shape the document so as to avoid em barassm- ut from this source. In saving that certain classes will be pardoned, w ith their rights restored, it is not said that oth er classes, on other terms, will never be in cluded. In saying that a reconstruction yvill be accepted if presented in a specified way, it is not said that it will never be ac cepted in any other way. i-v.ivt'ip.r’oy. The movements for emancipation in seve ral of the States not in-dud and in the eman cipation proclamation are matters of pro found congratulation, and while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so earnestly said upon this subject, rny general views and feelings remain unchanged, and I trust Congress will omit no fair, opportu nity of aiding these important steps to the great consumation. 

TRIBUTE TO SO LO I EES AND SAILORS. In the midst of other cares, however im portant, we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still onr main reli ance. To that power alone can we look for anything to give confidence to the people in the contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them. Until that confidence shall be established, little can l>e done anywhere for what is called rc construetion, hence onr chief efforts must be directed to the army and navy who have thus, far done their harder part so nobly and well. It may be esteemed fortunate that in giving the greatest efficiency to their in dispensable arras we do also honorably en courage gallant men, from the commander to the sentinel, who compose them, and to whom, more than all others, the world mustl stand indebted for the home of freedom, disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged and per petuated. (Signed) ABRAHAM LINCOLN. December 8, 180.1. ! The following proclamation is appended to the message : PROCLAMATION. TTuebeas, By the Constitution of the United States, it is provided that the Presi dent shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment, ; and— Whereas, a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal state governments of several states have for a long time been subverted and many persons have committed and are now guilty of treason against the United States, and Whereas > With reference to said rebellion and treason laws have been enacted by Con gress, enacting the forfeiture and cohfisca tion of property and liberation of slaves of all upon the terms and conditions therein stated, and also declaring that the Presi dent was thereby authorized at any time thereafter, by proclamation to extend par don to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion in any state or part of a state, with such exceptions and at such terms, and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare; and Whereas, the Congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon accords with well established judicial expositions of the pardoning power ; and W/icreas, With reference to said rebellion, the President of the United States has issued several proclamations with provis ions in regard to the liberation of slaves; and Whereas, It is now desired, by some per sons heretofore engaged in said rebellion, to resume heir allegiance to the United States, and remaugurate loyal State Governments within and for their respective States ; Now therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, Pres ident of the United States, do proclaim, de clare and make known to all persons who have, directly or by implication, participated in tho existing rebellion, save as hereinafter excepted,—that a full pardon is granted to them, with the restoration of all their rights, upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath and thence forward keep and maintain said oath invio late, and which oath shall be recorded for permanent preservation, and shall be cf the tenor and effect following, to wit: “I do solemnly swear, in tho presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth faith fully support, protect and defend the Con stit ition and laws of the United States, and the Union of the States thereunder; and that I will, in like manner, abide and faith fully support all the acts of Congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress, or by the decision cf the Supreme Court; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all Proclamations of the President, made during the existing rebel lion, having reference to slaves, so long und so far as not modified or declared void by the decision of the Supreme Court, so help me God,” The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the so-called Confederate gov ernment; all who have left judicial stations under the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are or shall have been military or naval officers of the rank of Colonel in the army or lieutenant in the navy; all who left seats in the United States Congress to aid in the rebellion; all who resigned their commissions in the army and navy of the United States, and afterwards aided the re bellion ; and all who have engaged in any manner in treating colored persons, or white i persons in charge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which per sons maybe found in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity. 1 do further proclaim, declare and make known, that whenever, in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, or North Carolina, a number of persons, not less than one-tenth of the num ber of the votes cast in such States at the Presidential election of the year of our Lord 1860, —each having taken the oath aforesaid and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter, by the election laws of the State cxisiting immediately before the so called act of secession, and excluding all others—shall establish a State Government which shall be Republican in form and in no wise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true Government of the State, and the State shall receive there under the benefits of the constitutional pro vision which declares that the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government, and shall protect each of them against invasion, and on application of the Legislature, or the Executive when the Legislature cannot be ' convened, against domestic violence. 1 do further proclaim, declare and make known, that any provision which may be adopted by such State Government in rela tion to the freed people of such State, which shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom and provide for their education, and ‘ which may yet ho consistent as a temporary ‘ arrangement with their present condition as a laboring, landless and homeless class, r. ;>i ! e objected to by the National Exccu- live, and it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal State Govern ment in any State, the name of the bounda ries, the subdivisions, the constitution, and the federal code of laws, as before the rebel lion, le maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary by the condi tions hei in before stated, and such others, if any, ; ot contravening said conditions, which may be deemed expedient by these forming the new State Government. To atoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say, that this proclamation, so far as it relates to State Governments, has no reference to States whereof the State Gov ernments have all the while been main tained ; and for the same reason it may be proper to further say that whether the mem bers, sent to Congress from any ’State shall )>e admitted to scats, constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective Houses, and not, to any extent, with the Executive; and still further, that the Proclamation is in tended to present to the people of the States wherein the National authority has been suspended and the loyal State governments have been supplanted, a mode by which the national authority over every loyal State government may be established; within said States, or any of them, and while the mode presented is the best the Evccutivc can sug gest with his present impression, it must pot he understood that another possible mode would not be accepted.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN. By the President. Wm. 11. Seward, Secretary of State. THE CHRONICLE" E. CROSBY : : : : : Editor. Thursday Morning Drc. 17. The Presidoiit’s Mesnags. We have thought it beat to publish this able document of the Chief Magis trate of the Nation, and we do it to the exclusion of nearly everything else. — We publish it almost entire, a few mi nor paragraphs being left out. Wo hope our subscribers will read it careful ly. The following remarks, from the Journal, being in our opinion, good, wo reprint them: “The portion of the message, however, which will attract most attention, and give greatest satisfaction, is that in which he asserts his deliberate and un wavering purpose to carry out the eman cipation proclamation to the letter—that be will neither retract or modify it, or return to slavery any person who is free by its terms —and in which he lays down a plan for building up again in fairer proportions and on firmer foundations, the broken and dclapidated fabrics of the rebellious states. He adopts none of the theories of reconstruction heretofore pro posed, but offers pardon and the same rights in the Union which are enjoyed by the loyal states to the whole people of the south, with the exception of a few lead ers of the rebellion, whenever they are ready to take an oath of allegiance to the Government of the Union. Copper heads and rebel sympathizers have made great complaint that some terras of ad justing the present difficulties and restor ing peace have not been offered the reb els. This complaint they can make no longer. The President has offered a ba sis for the re-cstahlishmcnt of peace as when it comes will ‘so come as to stay.’ ” 

LATE NEWS. The Laird rams have been sold by tho Confederate agents to the British gov ernment, defrauding the rebel sympathis ing Englishmen who had advanced mon ey on them. Quite a yanlcte trick for Southern men. The steamer Chesajicake, by some means or other, was stolen by the rebels olf the Banks of New Foundland, and taken to sea for a privateer. Govern ment has sent vessels in pursuit. The Supreme Court of lowa has de clared constitutional the law authorizing her soldiers in the field to vote. Late accounts from Texas represent Prices’ rebel forces very much reduced and exhausted, numbering less than 5,- 000, with a large Federal force pursuing them. A largo number of vessels have been ordered to Wilmington, N. C., k>t the blockade service at that port. A correspondent from Knoxville says that our total loss during the siege was 1,000. It is also stated that the rebel Joss will reach 5,000. Be-eniisting in the arny still contin ues. The 19th Pa. have ic-enlisted and gone home on short furlough to recruit. Gov. Letcher's message to the rebel legislature of Virginia, is one of the most perfect specimens of Southern braggado cio that we have ever seen. In Congress a special Joint committee will soon be appointed to consider what legislation is necessary to enable the loy al people of the South to restore their States to the Union on the basis of the President’s message and proclamation.— To this committee will probably be refer red the bills now before Congress on the subject of siariesy, i&l such other bills as may be introduced which bear upon that general topic. Letters have been received at Wash ington from prominent conservative mem bers, of the rebel congress from North Carolina, ashing unofficially upon what terms the Southern States would be per mitted to return to the Union. Rows in Brief. John Morgan.—lt is rumored that Mor gan has escaped bit# Kentucky. Look out for trouble. i —Gen. Grant is soon to be made a Lieut. General.

Army Correspondence. II EADQUARTEBS SIST WIS. R EG. ') Mursfrpfbofo, Term, Dec. 4th. ( Friend Wbiqgleswortji. —Since my last letter we have n(A had much to vary the daily routine of duty or break the dull monotony of camp-life. We still remain here, and have established our selves in very comfortable log huts, that will answer for winter quarters, though we do not know whether we shall be per mitted to remain here or not all winter. The llsth Ohio is added to the force here, and we have a regiment of cavalry also the 4th Tennessee, composed of East Tennesseans and Georgeans, who are most uncompromising Union men, and intensely bitter in their hatred of the rebels, having been robbed by them of everything they possessed in the world and then driven from their homes, in many instances barely escaping with their lives. No wonder that they are good Union men, for their loyalty has been tried as it were by fire. They are tho boys who really are ‘spoiling for a fight,’ and woe to the rebel who dares to mea sure swords with any of these gallant Southerners, they will not trouble them selves to take many prisoners, for with them it is “war to the knife, and the knife to the hilt.” Many of the brave fellows have not heard from their homes or families for eighteen months. East Tennessee has contributed ten cavalry and eleven infantry regiments to the Union cause. Let the assertion never be made that there if little, is any, union sentiment existing in the South, There is plenty of it, but, like a cork in water, it is hidden so long as kept down by rebel hands; remove the rebel pressure and it springs to the surface buoyant and strong, ready to do battle for tho right. It requires only opportunity for development. T\ e were pleased to see in, the Chron icle so many names of the home patri ots who volunteer ed on the 10th of Nov. That’s right,. friends and fellow soldiers; no matter if I ncle Sam did: use a rather forcible argument to induce you to enlist, the olid gentleman got a little testy at your tardiness*. and now, if you consider your service worth more to your country than the paltry sum of three hundred dollars, come down and help us close up this war. We will give you a hearty welcome, and feast you on “hard tack arid sow belly.” Well initiate you in all the mysteries of “Hay foot, straw foot,” and when we get in the fight you shall have an equal chance with ourselves in showing the rebels your bravery. Capt. Burdick went home too weeks ago on sick leave for twenty days. Lt. Jeardoe “runs” the company. We still have “Nellie” with ui, and although not exactly the “daughter of the Regiment” yet she is a great pet with everyone.— Now don’t imagine that “Nellie” is a romantic young lady, dressed up in Uncle Sam’s blue,. and following her lover through the wars* No, she is only a little “dorg,” a rat terrier, that some of our boys enticed from her virtuous home in Hodgeville, about a year ago. She is a good soldier, as she will rout and de feat whole battalions of rats,, always coming off the victor. The health of the Regiment continues good, the cold weather iutefy having pro duced a beneficial effect upon our appe tites. One of our boys whispered mys teriously in our car just now “Pickles and onions go bully, transportation facil ities between here and Hodgeville are excellent,” —wonder what the fellow moans. It is a great pleasure to the sol-,ss?■ to hear from home. So “mail day’ ’i| anx_ iously looked for by all, when we hear the cheerful voice of “Sammy” calling out “Hurrah hoys, come and get your letters,” and as he distributes them, each one is anxiously expecting to her his name called, untill the orderly says “all told,” when the lucky ones retire to their tents to read the welcome missive, and the disappointed ones walk away with elongated faces, muttering “I wonder why it is that ray folk don't write to me oftener,” —and, gentle readers, wives, mothers and sisters, permit me to say that you do not write often enough to ns. Perhaps you will excuse yourselves by saying. “Oh, I can think of nothing of interest to write about, there is no news about homo.” Bless your heart, there is any amount of news. Give us all the c* dails of the little interests of home; tell us about baby’s smart saying and do ings, how delighted little Charlie was with his new boots, how well Mary is progressing with her studies at school, and how neatly you turned and dyed that old silk dress of yours, until it looks as good as new, Write us occasionally what Mrs. Grundy has to say about the Smith’s and Jones’s and Brown's; and if you are so unfortunate as to have any copperheads in your locality, inform us of their words and actions, so that we can attend to their cases when we return home. Write to us of all such little in cidents, they almost make us think we are home again; and in the evening twi light wc sit around our camp-fires and talk of all these things, and sing togeth er “Home, sweet home,” “My Mother’s Biblp” and other pleasant all-time melor dies that awaken tender memories in our hearts that have much to harden them in this nomadic, demoralizing every-day life that a soldier necessarily leads, “Taps” arc heating for “lights out,” so good night.
