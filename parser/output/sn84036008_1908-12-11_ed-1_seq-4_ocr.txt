SUGAR BEET CONTRACTS FOR It is important to the raisers of sugar beets that they should sign con tracts with the local factory at the earliest possible moment. Every man who intends to raise beets next year knows at the present moment precisely 'the acreage he pro poses to cultivate. The factory makes its estimates on the tonnage contracted for, and in or der to do this, the officials must know in. advance just what to expect, as the farmer must first know that he has a market for his beets before he plans cultivation. Positive knowledge as to the supply is just as important to the management of the mill, as the assur ance of the market is to the farmer, and where there is everything to gain and nothing to lose by signing the contracts at the earliest possible mo ment, we are at a loss to understand why there should be hesitation. The man who signs now, has the ad Vantage that he may engage his labor at this time-for he has the market to insure it. The man who signs last or who does not sign at all, is at a positive disadvantage, for the reason that the most experienced labor will have been retained by those who have had the foresight to act now. --o---~-- 

BOND ISSUE FOR WATERWAYS. Public sentiment will admit of but qne solution of the waterways discus sion, and that is the steady improve ment of the rivers and 'hatbors of the country. The proposition to. issue bonds to the extent of $500,000,000 for the im mediate improvement of the rivers, is doubtless put forward by some ex tremist. Great improvements are not started in that manner-nor is it pos sible to immediately .employ such a vast sum with the greatest economy. Growth of the mushroom variety is not desired, and work performed in that manner is never permanent in character. We must creep before we can walk, and we must inquire before we can be positive, and the government must in vestigate before it can act. Certain waterways should be im proved. The man living on the 'banks of the' Ohio river is of the opinion that the work of controlling that stream should commence at once, and that other riv ers should wait. The residents of Chicago are equally, as positive that the country will be beneated best by deepening the Illi aois river, from the point where the drainage canal empties into it, to its confluence with the 'Mississippi. On the other hand, residents of the Mississippi river valley cannot under stand why they have been neglected. so long. You hear the same story on the banks of the Sacramento, the Colum bia, the Brazos, the Rio Grande, the Hudson, the Potomac, the James and the Missouri, and so on through the' list of navigable streams. Residents on the Lower Yellowstone have the same complaint, and at the present time inquiries are being made with this very thought in view-but it cannot all be done at once. There is more than one question in volved in the matter of permanent im provement to the ,waterways, for there is the conservation of the sup ply, and hence the control of the wa ter. The Ohio river floods are greater now than they were in times gone by, for the reason that the mountains have been denuded, and melting snows give their waters to the stream faster than should be the case, and the result is disastrous floods from the source, to the delta of the Mississippi. All these things will come in time, for the various departments of the government, are acting in harmony in the work, to the end that the greatest good may be accomplished 'for the benefit of all. Millions are being ex pended annually, and the sum is being added to constantly. Impatience will not help 'matters, for there 'is always before the government the question of self-preservation, and to deepen and open certain of our streams to the world would result in incalculable in SJury in the event of war. Before these streams are dredged, to the end that ships of greater draft Smay ply them, we must have not only the warships to protect commerce, but the land batteries and fortifications to 'defend the entrances. .' All of these improvements move to gether, phalanx like, and to rush one : ahead of the other would mean to un bllace the order of things, without aclopllshing the good it is sought to Selected Simon president of t natives will now proceed e assassination clube, to re In t I e bitdt of l.fe he *salad a blae game THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Roosevelt's last annual message to congress is a .comprehen sive, if a somewhat lengthy document. There has been a tendency in recent years to increase the length of these executive communications *to the na tional legislature. The policy is one of necessity rather than choice, The country is expanding rapidly, and the diversified interests are so great that conditions are modified between the adjournment and re-assembling of the congress. The members, during the summer vacation, are not as closely in touch with affairs, as are administrative of ficers of the government, and thus it is that the yearly messages of the president embraces something of the character of a general report of the various branches of the public service, coupled with recommendations for fu ture conduct. The message published this morn ing is properly divided into subjects, so that the busy reader may select just that portion of it in which he is most interested if he does not care to read it all. It opens with a discussion of the financial affairs of the' nation, and recommends changes in an im perfect banking system. Wise regula tion of great corporations is urged, with government control, though not in a manner to weaken the rights of the states. Protection to workingmen, care for the laborer who has been injured in service or the family of the man whose life has been lost, is a provision the president recommends be enacted into a law. Dreadful wrongs to the working class he deplores, and points a way out of the present maze of dif ficulty, to a clearer light and to firmer ground. In this respect the United States, he says, is the most negligent of nations, and compares unfavorably with even the poorest of Europe, with regard to the policy of employers' lia bility. Reform in the judiciary, while nec essary, he says is not possible at a time when the courts are attacked in discriminately. A campaign of villification, he avers, defeats the very object it is sought to attain. Certain decisions have been detrimental to the rights of labor. It is only when the matter is dis cussed in a fair and impartial manner, and without attempting extremes in either direction, that the best results for labor may be attained. In this regard he takes up the sub ject of class legislation, and points out weaknesses in plans proposed, in that many of the remedies are uncon stitutional, and for that very reason ineffective. COhecking the abuse of in junctions, he says, is necessary, on which point all sides agree. Judges interpret the law, they do not govern the people; the laws are passed by the people, and where unconstitutional, decision is so rendered, in accordance with the ldtter of the statutes. Equal rights to all is demanded, and a prop osition to give special privileges to one class and deny the same privileges to another class, is therefore, stamped as unconstitutional-in accordance with the laws the majority of the peo pie have in each case insisted upon. Curbing the use of overgrown for tunes, and the uses to which they may be employed to infringe on the rights of others, is recommended. Protection of the forests and the peril threatened by denuding the mountains, and injuring the sources of water supply, is brought to the atten tion of the law makers. Action to improve inland waterways is recommended. Policing of national parks by the army is urged. The steady progress of the Indian wards of the government is comment ed upon. He renews his recommendation for the establishment of a postal savings bank, to be conducted by the govern ment. Establishment of parcels post on rural routes is pointed to as a neces sity. Then, in order, he discusses the se cret service, education, the census, re distribution of bureaus, public health, government printing, soldiers' homes, commissions, statehood of New Mex ico and Arizona, interstate waters, fisheries and seal furs, foreign affairs, irelations with South American repub lies, the Panama canal, ocean mail service, Hawaii, the Philippines, Porto Rico, Cuba, the Japanese exposition, military affairs, the national guard and the navy. - -o------- 

INCREASE IN CIRCULATING MEDIUM. ,In seven years there has been an in crease in the money circulation of the country of $902,991,399-a per capita of $7.06-an unprecedented fact. We are such a busy people, and we make money so fast, that we are impatient. We want constantly more and more. And because of this, we lose sight of the fact that we are more prosperous than ever before, or than any other nation, for the smatter of that. After expanding business to the snapping point a reaction sets in, for the very reason that it is impossible to make a yard stick measure more than three feet. When this situation arises, the average man is apt to insist that there is a shortage of money, overlooking entirely the fact that in the brief span of seven years, there has been an actual increase of nearly $1,oo00ooo,ooo. -,---O-------. Evidertly the New York World is jealous of the notoriety of HIskell. PRESERVATION OF THE FORESTS That portion of President Roose velt's message dealing with the pres ervation of the forests, is most inter esing. He sounds an alarm. Denuding the mountains, can have but one result, and that the desola tion of the land. In this regard, President Roosevelt cites a number of cases, in different parts of the world, formerly garden spots, now great wastes, because of the ruthless cutting of the timber, de stroying the source of water supply, changing the rivers from deep and well filled channels to shallow and un certain streams, and extending the desert area, slowly and certainly. He points to the encroachments made by the Chinese deserts, within the mem ory of nearly every man now alive, and the gradual retreat of the popula tion before the advance of the arid wastes. It is because the forests have been cut down, the stumps pulled up and the roots grubbed out, that the freshets have washed away the soil, carried gravel and pebbles over the once fertile valleys below, and changed the rivers from navigable wa terways to wandering ditches. It will take centuries-possibly thousands of years to bring back the old condition, even with unremitting effort and ceaseless work. What has been done in China, is be ing repeated in Old Mexico, and we are dangerously close to the same con dition in this country. The president has pointed the way, and the forestry service is not only endeavoring to protect, but is at tempting to increase the timbered area, by reclaiming plains sections, and preserving the tree life at the head of streams and the conservation of the sources of water supply. The message is a timely note of warning, which will be heeded by the people-particularly those living in the western states, where every drop of water is precious. -------o------ 

DISAPPEARANCE OF THE. SAR GASSO SEA. Mariners returning from voyages across the central Atlantic ocean, re port the disappearance of the Sargas so Sea. The area formed one of the' most remarkable marine gardens in the world. It was first encountered by Colum bus, in 1492 when he was seeking the Indies by the western route, he skirted the northern outlines of the sea. It was due to this fact that the new old continent was found, for his su perstitious sailors were on the verge of revolt. He pointed to the drift weed as evidence of the fact that they were approaching land. Several times floating plant life was mistaken for terra firma. In a subsequent voyage, six years later the explorer crossed this ocean garden diagonally: The Sargasso sea is a formed by a great eddy in the mid-Atlantic ocean, where the warm flow of the Gulf stream, combining with similar currents on four sides, impart a gyra tory movement to the surface of the water. Great weeds, sometimes as much as 100 feet in length, and ex tending for 600 miles, drift along, lengthwise. The mass moved slug gishly. All the storm tossed hulks of wrecked and abandoned craft caught in the outer circle of this eddy, were carried to the center, just as a fly is entrapped in the spider's web-to rot and sink in the vortex. Ship wrecked men in that sea gave up all hope, for they were out of the path of steamers, and unless they managed to climb aboard some water-logged ves sel, on which there was still food and water they perished. Occasionally a sailing vessel, was driven into it by stress of weather. In the great expanse of weed cov ered ocean, the hulks of hundreds of vessels, steamers of modern make and sailing ships of all types, might be found. Some, log or lumber laden, floated for years, barely above the wa ter line, and hence it was that ma riners gave the place a wide berth, for to run afoul of one of these sub merged wrecks, meant destruction. The section has been a school for sci entists, as well as a terror for sea far ing men. The sea was located in central South Atlantic, about half way between the Azores and the Antilles, on a line al most due east from New Orleans, and midway between the Flbrida coas~t and Great Sahara desert of Africa. Its reported disappearance will form an interesting topic for scien tists, who are interested to know the reason while it removes from the path of sailors an area that he has always approached with fear. Some disturbance, in the land that forms the floor of the ocean is doubt less the cause of the reported disap pearance of this remarkable area, which formed a magnificent marine garden, with ever shifting scenes, that defied alike the effort of pen or brush to accurately depict. ------o------- A college professor tells us that the pursuit of. happiness is a national peril. Well, well. Just the same, we have an idea that we will continue to rush on to destruction. ----------o--~----· Probably the Dutch waited until Castro got out of the country before trying to run a whizzer on Venezuela. it's easier with an embargo os his return. ----o----0----- A magazine discusses "Men as Hu bands.'"

He added that he had been some what misled regarding his interpreta tion of the attitude of the speaker by reports of Mr. Cannon's speech be fore the Cleveland chamber of com merce. The official' report of that speech, he said, had given him an en tirely different impression. "I had an interview with Mr. Can non yesterday," said Mr. Taft, "and with his concurrence, and at the sug gestion of members of the ways and means committee with the Republican members of that committee this after noon. From my conversation with them and with the discussion that fol lowed as to the examination they were now conducting and expect to conduct, I have every reason to be confident that they are keenly alive to the obligation which is on them as representatives eledted to represent the Republican party, to prepare an honest and thorough revision of the present tariff, that they have taken three times as much evidence as has ever been taken in the preparation of other tariffs and that they are going to make an independent effort to get the evidence themselves by subpoena and under oath, with a view to reach ing the differences in the cost of pro duction of the various articles brought within the tariff here and'abroad. "I found them quite anxious for as mnch help as possible, in which I sym pathized with them and consulted with them on points which might arise in the future. The plan is to prepare a bill on such evidence as they have and will have in .the house of the hearings and then to call for additional 'evidence as to the item, whenever it should seem necessary. Not only from conversa tion with the members, but individu ally I am quite convinced that they in good faith are going to prepare a bill which shall be a thorough revision, on the basis of, the Republican plat form. "The discussion covered other things, like the Philippine tariff and I am very hopeful that there will be no difficulties in reaching an agreement between the various people interested -those representing the Philippine is lands and those representing the sugar and tobacco interests-so that'there will be no dispute, and that the mat ter may be incorporated in the new tariff bill without a dispute."

NEARLY $600,000 PAID TO FARMERS FOR SUGAR BEETS (Continued from First Page.) detailed information about the past year's crop: "Editor Gazette, "Billings, Montana. 'Dear Sir: "Our beet harvest is about over, and although we have had a very unsuc cessful fall, which retarded the har vest, we have been able to get practi cally all beets harvested, and, as was predicted, the result of this year's op eration has been very satisfactory to growers. Yield Has Been Large. "Beets have made all the way from 10 to 25 tons per acre, the average of the entire acreage will be better than 12 tons. If we would cut out the ex perimental territories, the home terri tory where they have 'been growing beets for three years would make an average of 15 tons per acre. This com pany will pay for about 115,000 tons of beets this year at about $5.00 per ton, which makes about $575,000.00 paid out to farmers this year for beets, and still have not nearly reached enough supply for capacity of our fac tory. Outlook Flattering. "I am pleased to say that prospects for a full acreage for next year are already flattering. Contracts are com ing in very fast, and we hope 'by hav ing the growers co-operate with our company to have all necessary acre age signed up by February 1. This will enable growers to get in touch with better -help than is possible to secure at the last moment. It will also enable the company to intelligent ly order their supplies and make nec essary improvements to handle the enormous crop we expect to harvest next fall. We have inquiries from all over the country from people who Wish to rent land for the cultivation of beets, and parties desiring to rent their farms for sugar beet cplture who will advise the Billings Sugar com pany Of their terms, improvements, etc., will 'be put in touch with desir able tenants, as we come in contact with them. Co-operation Is Desired. "It is our desire to co-operate with ranchers in every way possible as it is a mutual 'benefit, and as this valley is only in the experimental stages, if every one interested in the develop ment of Yellowstone county will work together, there is no reason why enough beets to supply the factory should not be grown between Park City and Billings. Think of what this would mean to the county as we all knoyw that the more beets are planted the better condition the ground will be in for other crops. This means a larger increase in cattle, sheep and hogs, three times as many people and that much more money in circulation, consequently a noticeable improve ment in Billings, Laurel and other cit les of the county. Therefore, we ex pect the hearty co-operation of every itizen in Yellowstone county toward this development, which is here wait ing for us. The sooner the' land is all under intensive cultivation, the sooner It will reach its true value, and we all know that it is what an acre of land produces which finally creates its true value, and if, as stated above, we can grow an average of 15 tons on one acre, that acre is worth just what that will pay interest on, so that you can readily see that every acre that will produce this amount of money it worth 1300.00. Relations with Growers Satisfactory. "I am 'glad to say that our dealings with the growers this past season have been very satisfactory, and the business is on as good a basis as I could wish, still the possibilities here are so great that it ought not to be necessary for this company to send ifty or one hundred thousand dollars 1o Wyoming when it could be kept within Yellowstone county, which we hope in the near future to do, 'but we need the co-operation of every broad ninded citizen to bring this result quickly, and I am optimistic enough to believe that before the expiration of two years, there will be more facto ries required to handle the beets grown in Yellowstone county, if all who wish to follow this business, have the opportunity. "Very sincerely yours, "JAMES SOILL.EY, "Chief Agriculturist." HIGH SCHOOL HAZING. Considerable talk Is prevalent among the pupils of the High school over the attempted hazing of two reshmen by four seniors. As the story goes, the superintendent became cog nizant of what was going on and in stead of the freshies getting into trouble, the seniors were caught and one of them was suspended for a year, two for a term and the fate of the fourth is yet to be decided. It is un derstood that Superintendent Nye will not tolerate hazing in any form, as has been demonstrated by the suspen sions above referred to. MAN MADE THREATS. Disturbance Charged In' Arrest Made By Police. Fred Culver is at the city jail with a charge of drunk and disturbance against him and Ray E. Mullen Is booked as disturbing the peace, but has been released by the police onu his own recognizance and 'will appear against Culver this morning at police court.

President Castro received a tele gram from King Alfonso thanking him for salutations which he sent from Santanader and conveying the king's 'best 'wishes for the president's health and the prosperity of Venezuela. The physicians in attendance de cline to give a description of the mal ady from which Castro is suffering.
