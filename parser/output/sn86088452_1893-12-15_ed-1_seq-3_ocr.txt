placed on gold or silver or paper Hut if paper is the money it could not join tho commeicial volume1 thc reporter ventured Well it would be money working In the circulation effecting its ends and it would serve all the purposes ol money Gold and silver will always bo in commerce and can always bo employed as far as they will go for money Tho money volume must bo increased to the needs of the > oople tmd the day is coming when that will bo tho case Do you favor free and unlimited coinage of silver Public sentiment is formulating on silver and it will turn to greenbacks Faper bearing the fiat ol the govern ment is tho loming money and it will bo honest money All money of every nation is fiat money Without the fiat it is not money Gold is sold as a commoiity light weight or heavy weight and s lver the same Neither of them is money without tho fiat after which they bring 100 cents on tho dollar Make paper money bear ing tho fiat of the government receiv able for all dues and that will end the vexations and give tho peoplo rest What about tho tariffff Oh the everlasting tariff That is the great delayer Let the tariff alono Iet it bo an after considera tion Tho tariif question should not

however that by means of tariff agitation the gteat question of money can be held in abeyance but in the end and bjfore many years the true principles enunciated by tho tfat party will prevail
