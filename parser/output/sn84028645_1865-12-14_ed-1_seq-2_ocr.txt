Honest and Sincere in Their Loyalty. ' .The recent tour ot observation by Gen. Grant through the South, has convinced him (so he has told the President) that the gontn almost unanimously desire a speedy readmlssion to their old position sin the Union, and that their professions of future loyalty and, good behavior are hdnelana sincere. This, be It remembered, is not the language of a politician, or of a man speci ally In the interest of the South. It is the testimony pf a man who ha done consider able in holding' the South In the Union against their will; and 'It follows, necessa rily, that he did.

'The quickest way and the proper way, to dls- pose of the question was at once to swear the Tennessee members In, as Messrs " Firfc; GniDMTand "Smith "argued honld bo done. This was refused by the Re publican members." The next proper eoerse to pursue was te- refer their cre dentials to the Committee on Elections, to which Mr. Raymond expressed a wish they should be ruforred. t'Ia this he undoubted ly gave utterance to the wlshes of tlie Pres ident, but this wish the Hepubllcan mem bers refused to gratify: so they sent them toTHABs SmvtNs' revolutloftry .and:un eonstitutional committee of fifteen.

The state ment that Southern men of influence were willing to comply wfth any demand the President might consider necessary for their restoration, Is significant. They know jtbe composition Of this. Congress, they know It Is likely to be dominated' over and controlled by men who would, degrade, nu Imillate and fronton them to the utmost ex tremity; and nchce tber do not proclaim a willingness to comply with any. demands Congra$ might consul necessary for their irestoration. They put their trust in the President In his humanity,' justice and lite lingering attachment to the Constitution and hope that his exactions will not be re pulsive. : Shall they be disappointed?
