PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. PROSTRATION OF BUSINESS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR ITS REVIVAL. To the Senate and liow.e of Jlep raientaliccs: Since tho convening of Congress one year ago, the nation has undergone a prostration in business and industries, such as has not beca witnessed xrith va lor runny years. SiK'ulution as to the eanso for this prostration might be in dulged in -without profit, because as nuiiy theories wonl-i bo advanced as there, would be writers independent of tuosii wiio expressed the.r own views, without borrowing, upia the subject Without induing in theories as to the cause of tills prostration, therefore, I will call your ultention only to the fact and to some questions as to which it would seem there should Vie i:o disagree-1 merit. During this prostration two es- rntf ,dT' ve been most abiuidantkbor and capital. Both have been largely unemwloyed. Where ntv has been undoubted secimty liaa been undoubted capital has oeeu anaiuaoie at very moderate rates. Where labor ha.? been wanted it has been found in abundance at cheap rates com pared with what necessaries and comforts of life coTild be purchased with the wages demandi :d. Two great elements of m-oe- neritv, therefore, have not been denied " A third might be added. Our soil and climate are uneoualed within the lim its of and contagious territory under one nationality, for its varietion of products to feed and clotha a people and the amount of surplus to spare to feed less favored people. Therefore, with these facts in view, it Beems to mo that wise statesmanship at this session of Congress wo oiu oictftte ignoring tne past. Uirectine: in proper channels these great elements ot prosperity. To any people debt abroad is the only element that can. with alwavs a sound currencv, enter into our anairs to cause any contained depression ui uie LLUiuMtnes ana prosperity ol our people. A great conflict for national ex istence made necessary for temporary purposes, the raising of large sums of money irorn wnatever source attainable. It made necessary, in the wisdom of Congress, and I do not doubt their wis dom in tlie premises regarding the ne cessity ot tiie tunes, to devise a system of national cawscy which it proved to be impossible to keep on a par -with rec ognized currency cf the civiliztaj world. This begot a spirit of speculation involv ing an extravagance and luxury' not re-1 quired for the happiness and pfaeperity of a people, and involving, .both directly and $ indirectly,'' foreign indebtedness. The currency being of a fioctuatinz value. therefore, unsafe to hold for legijEniate subject' of speculation in itself .'These two causes, however, have involved us in foreign indebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower and- lender, which should be paid in coin and according to tiie -bopd - agreed npon" wtierj- the .3eBt was contracted, gold its Kuivaletrt. The good faith of the government cannot be violated towards creditors without na tional disgrace. . " ' Our commerce ihould be ennonrao-ed American ship building and carrying ca pacity increased, foreign markets sought tor the products of the soil .and manu-i lactones to the end tftafwe nay be' abi pay these debts where a market can be created .for the sale of .our . products,. eiuier oi tne sou, ine mine or the mann faory-r rj Si'r'l3f)' 

CURRENCY—SPECIE RESUMPTION. specie basis, A new means is discovered of ntliziruri our iaie capiuu tuiu iaDor to me aa vant age of the whnlo people, but in mv judgment the tirst step toward aocom- piiRinng tins object is to sacure a curren good wherever civilzation reifrns. one which if it becomes superabundant with one peoplY will find a market with some other a currency which has had its ba sis the labor necessary to produce it. which will 'give its value.'. Gold and sil ver are now the recognized mediums of exchange the civibzed world over, and this we should return with the least practicable delay. In view of the pledges the American Congress when our present legal tender system was adopted and the debt contracted, there should be delay, certainly no unnecessary delay infixing by legislation a method by which we will return to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your epecial attention. . I believe firmly that there can be no permanent and prosper ous revival of business and industries until a policy is adopted, with legislation carry it out, looking to a return to a It is easy to conceive that i . a . i . . ueuior aiiu speculative Dasis may it of value to them to make the so- money abundant until they can throw a portion of their burdens upon others, but even these, I believe, would disappointed in the result if a course should be pursued which will keep in doubt the value of the legal tender me dium of exchange. A revival of the pro ductive industries is needed by all class es, by none more than the holders of property of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate from realization upon its sales, But admitting that these two classes of citizens are to be benefitted by expan great, sion, would it be honest to give if Would not the ceneral 1 OSS bo frtn rrrani justify 6ueh relief Would it not be as honest and prudent to authorize over issues bv unscrmmlons m,,i;t . debtor to issue bis own legal tender Si T?' to io. say that all debts and obligations are ob gone literated in the United Sites and now commence anew, free from encum the brance' These propositions are too ab thinks sxiril to be entertained for a moment by j Every delay in the preparation of final resumption partakes of this dishonesty and is only less in degree as the prop is held out that a oorveni.-inf BAaonn A arrive for the good work of redeem- i our podges to commence,- It will I my cpimoa,' except by j a.inn r,f rVm.. l.

It is the duty of Congress to devise the method of correcting the evils which are acknowl edged to exist and not mine, but I will venture to suggest two or three things which s-"ai to in-a; absolutely necessary i cio payments, the first to a return to great reqmsit ' a a return to prosperity. The legal tender clause to the law author ; SP5 "sue ot currency by the na ns. t'?mJ Sovernm. :ut should be repealed, to take effect as to all contracts entered into after a day fixed iu the repealing act, not to apply, however, to payments of salaries by the government, or for other expenses now provided by law to be paid in currency. In the interval pending be tween repeal and hnal resumption, pro vision shonld be made by which the sec retary can obtain gold as it may become Necessary, from time to time, from the date when specie resumption commences. To this mU'ht and should be added a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenses to insure an accumulation of gold in the treasury to sustain redemption. I com mend this subject to your careful con sideration,' believing that a favorable so lution is sttainable, and that if reached by this Congress, that the present and future generations will ever gratefully remember it as tlieir deliverer from a thraldom of evil and disgrace". ;. . 

BANKING. With the resumption of specie pay ment free banking may be authorized with safety, giving the full protection to bill holders which they have under ex isting laws; indeed I would regard free banking as essential. It would give proper elasticity to the currency. As more currency should be required for the transaction of legitimate business, new DanKs would be started, and, m turn, banks would wind np their business when it was found there was a supera bundance oi currency. I he experience and judgment of the people can best de cide just how much currency is reauired for the transaction of the business of the country, It is unsafe to leave the set tlement of this question to Congress, the secretary ol tne treasury, or the executive. Congress should have the regulation nn- irdw.rhich banks may exist, bjitr hrard no maiia.pauKma a moncjor; by mnit wirg the -amount of redeemable paper cur rency tnat snail be authorized. Such importance do I attach to this subject and so earnestly do I comaeEd it to your attention, that I give it prominence by ; j 1 : i - t . . i luuuuuuii; it hi uie opguinuig oi uiis message: ':.lu :.' r :i To be concluded next week.
