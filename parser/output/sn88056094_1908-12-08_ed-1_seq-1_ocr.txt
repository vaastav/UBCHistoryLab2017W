COEUR D'ALENE EVENING PRESS LUMK* NUMBER 101 OOEOR D'ALENE, IDAHO. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8. 1908 RESIDENT'S MESSAGE ne of Greatest State Papers Issued by Any President ubiiigtou, Dec. 8.—In his message congress, read to the two bouses, president said: he financial standing of the nation the present time Is excellent, and financial management of the na 's Interests by the government dur the last seven yejjrs has shown the satisfactory results. But our enoy system Is Imperfect, and It earnestly to be hoped that the cur •y commission will be able to pro a thoroughly good system which 1 do away with the existing defects. ring the period from July 1, 1901, Sept. 30 , 1908 , there has been a net lus of nearly one hundred millions receipts over expenditures, a reduc n of the Interest bearing debt by ety millions, in spite of the extraor ry expense of the Panama canal a saving of nearly nine millions the annual interest charge. This is exceedingly satisfactory showing, has been a reduction of taxa Corporations. i regards the great corporations.en in interstate business, and espe the railroads, I can only repeat t 1 have already again and again In my messages to the congress, believe that under the Interstate of the constitution the United tes has complete and paramount to control all agencies of inter te commerce, and I believe that the onal government alone can exer thls right with wisdom and ef tlveness so as both to secure justice and to do justice to the great rations which are the most 1m ant factors In modern business. I that It Is worse than folly to npt to prohibit all combinations, i done by the Sherman anti-trust because such a law can be en only Imperfectly and unequal and its enforcement works almost much hardship as good. I strongly vocate that instead of an unwise : to prohibit all combinations there '11 be substituted a law which shall ressly permit combinations which In the Interest of the public, but 1 at the same time give to some ncy of the national government full r er of control and supervision over n. One of the chief features of control should be securing entire bllclty in ail matters which the pub has a right to know and, further ire, the power, not by judicial, but executive, notion to prevent or put stop to every form of Improper fa orltisxu or other wrongdoing. The railways of the country should put completely under the interstate 'mtneree commission and removed m the domain of the anti-trust law. e power of the commission should made thoroughgoing, so that It uld ever Iso complete supervision 1 control over the Issue of securities well as over the raising and lower of rates. As regards rates, at leas! power should be summary. Pow to make combinations and traffic Sreements should be explicitly con d upon the railroads, the permis of the commission being first alned and the combination or agree cut being published In all Its de *• The Interests of the sharehold of the employees and of the shlp rs should all be guarded as against e another. To give any one of them «lue and Improper consideration Is do Injustice to the others. Rates u *t i„. made us low as is compatible dth giving proper returns to all th# of the railroad, from the hthest to the,lowest, and proper re rns to the shareholders, but they u<i| n °t, for Instance, be reduced In ch fashion as to necessitate a cut Jho wages of the employees or the of the proper and legitimate Jilts of honest shareholders. Tclcgr.itih and telephone companies Bugul in Interstate business should M'U' under the jurisdiction of the In •srstate commerce commission. Ample Reward* For Intelligence. It is to the interest of all of us that * re should l*> n premium put upon "dividual initiative and individual ca j'* cit - r "id an ample reward for the Peat directing Intelligences alone com mauage the great business "Peratinns , lf today. u , g „. eI1 to keep "bid that exactly as the anarchist the worst enemy of liberty and the ■o ', eiary the worst enemy of order " ,b< " men who defend tbs rights of P 'iertv Upve most to fear from the ^roc.cd ers of great wealth, and the *bo are championing popular bare most to fear from the men right decia aacoicuea who In the name of popu ^rqrht* would do wrong te and op JT** bonest business men, honest men tr *' e * Uh ' for the success of either **** - ,f "Ton^doer per wearily in vitee a violent rea-Hlon against The cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds. The opposition to government con trol of these great corporations makes Its most effective effort In the ehrpe of an appeal to the old doctrine of states' rights. ' The proposal to make the national government supreme over, and there fore to give it complete control over, the railroads and other instruments, of Interstate commerce Is merely a pro posal to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes. If not the prime purpose, for which the constitution was founded. It does not represent centralization. I believe that the more farsighted corporations are themselves coming to recognize the unwisdom of the violent hostility they have displayed during the last few years to regulation and control by the national government of combinations engaged In Interstate busi ness. Labor, There are many matters affecting la bor aud the status of the wageworker to which I should like to draw your attention. As far as possible I hope to see a frank recognition of the ad vantages conferred by machinery, or ganization and division of labor, ac companied by an effort to bring about a larger share in the ownership by wageworker of railway, mill and fac tory. In farming this simply means that we wish to see the farmer own his own land. We Co not wish to see the farms so large that they become the property of absentee landlords who farm them by tenants nor yet so small that the .farmer becomes like a Euro pean peasant. The depositors In our savings banks now number over one-tenth of our en tire population. These are all capital ists who through the savings banks loan their money to the workers—that Is, in many cases to themselves—to •arry on their various Industries. Postal savings banks will make it easy for the poorest to keep their savings In absolute safety. The regulation of the national highways must be such that they shall serve all people with equal Justice. Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make It far safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest bis money In stocks. There must be prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman la bor, shortening of hours of all me chanical labor. Stock watering should be prohibited, and stock gambling, so far as Is possible, discouraged. There should be a progressive Inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial edu cation should be encouraged. 

THEODORE ROOSEVELT^ Protection For Wageworkers. There Is one matter with which the congress should deal at this session. There should no longer be any palter ing with the question of taking care of the wageworkers who. under our present Industrial system, become kill ed, crippled or worn out as part of the regular Incidents of a given business. The object sought for could be achiev ed to a measurable degree, as far as those killed or crippled are concerned, by proper employers' liability laws. As far as concerns those who have been worn out. I call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward I>ro ridlng old age pensions hare bee* taken In many of our private Indus tries.

DEMOCRATS MEET Hold Session of League in Washing ton. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.— To con sider plans for insuring party success in 1912, prominent democrats from many states are gathering in Wash ington today to take part in a sess ion of the National Democratic League. Chairman William C. Llller de clares that a meeting has not been called In the Interest of Bryan or any other candidate. He explained that it Is the purpose of the league to maintain Intact the organization now existing and to strengthen the league so as to eliminate the work of reorganization at the beginning of each campaign. "The democratic party, while dis appointed over the result of the election, hag much cause for elation." said Colonel Llller. "The party Is now united more thoroughly than at.any time since 1892. Its recent defeat has not dampened the enthusi asm of Its members, but awakened them to the necessity of proper or ganization and a return to true and fundamental democratic principles. The organization of clubs will be pushed everywhere from now on." Leading democratic clubs all over the country have sent representatives to the rally. The sessions will occupy tomorrow and Thursday. C. W. Smith, of Harrison, was to day appointed guardian for his two minor children, Claudia and Grace Smith, by Frobate Judge McCall. Barney Farr, of Lyondale, sub mitted proof on homestead this fore noon before the officers of the land office. QUILLAN AND V0ELKER RESIGN Were Disqualified by Living Out side City Limits. The city council met In regular session last evening, and after acting upon a few petitions, and passing three ordinances adjourned until Thursday. A petition was presented by E. M. Krelg asking for permission to con struct a stairway in the alley to the addition now being erected on the Dr. P. J. Skalloti building on the cor ner of Fourth and Sherman streets, and the prayer of the petitioner was granted. A petition was presented by Henry Higgins asking for a saloon license for his saloon which Is locat ed In the building formerly occupid by C. K. Leithe. The petition was referred to the commute on licenses for action. A petition was also pre sented by Ex-Commissioner Peterson asking that the city give him what ever trees he might dig out of the city streets on condition that he wouldd level up the ground after he had extracted them. No action was taken on the matter at last night's would level up the ground after he meeting, but It will probably be act ed upon at that held Thursday even ing The firm of Potter A Dolf peti tioned the council for the privilege of installing a billboard In the hall way of the new city hall building. The petition set out that the center of the board would be used for bulle tin purposes, and the exterior for ad vertising purposes. The council, however, was opposed to having any advertising scheme* whatever In the city ball, and the petition was denied. A fire ordinance waa passed mak ing all of that block known and des ignated as block Y a portion of the city fire limits. It seems that a prior ordinance taking this portion of the city into the fire limits, only took In half of thU block, and it was to rem edy this that the ordinance was | passed last evening. I An ordinance was also passed re pealing the ordinance Introduced by j Councilman Qulllan which named a ; number of the streets in that portion j of the city known as Government 1 Way. The streets were named after i Individuals of this city, snd one of | them bore the name of the council man who Introduced the ordinance naming them. It has been lately discovered thst this territory has nev LIBRARY BENEFIT Gets Owe Half of Week's Receipt* at Ui8 Kenodrome The first of the performances which will be given during the week at the Kenodrome by the manage ment of that institution for the bene fit of the public library was given last evening.

There was a fair at tendance last evening, KAliMi CLOTHES LINE Handy Thief Gets (Mill Another Washing. The clothes line thieves that have been Infesting the city for the last couple of weeks made a visit last evening to the homes of Chris Bern hardt and F. M. Kolborn. From the former they stole all the clothes that had been left on the line over night, and from the latter all, but two bed spreads. This makes the fifth theft of this character that has been perpetrated In the city within the last two weeks, and in each case the thieves have made a successful es cape, and left no clue behind by which they could be traced, and ap prehended. er been legally taken Into the corpo rate limits, snd It was for reason of this it is said, that the council re pcaled the ordinance naming the streets In it. The third ordinance passed was one making provisions for the con nection of private property with sew era. The ordinance makes It compul sory upon persons living within 200 feet of a sewer in any street or alley to make connections, and upon their fat I tire to do so after 30 days' notice by the city marshal, the city will order the connection made, and the cost be assessed against the property. The ordinance also provides that connections must be made with all roof troughs and spouta. vaults, cess ikkjIs, ditches, closets, etc. It furth er provides that the occupant of the porperty must keep In repair the private dralu connecting with the sewer, and upon hla failure to do so the city will have It repaired aud re ccover the cost by a suit brought against him. Before making con nections with the stwer It will be necessary to secure a permit, and It is provided that any person who falls to comply with Its terms shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The coun ctl reserves the right to revoke all permits granted. The ordinance pro vldea that a hotel making connec tions must be provided with gre traps, and all livery atablea with catch basins, and provide* a penal ty for obstructing the sewer with garbage, rubbish, dead animals or other obstructive material. The resignations of Connell men Voeiker and Qulllan were filed with the clerk yesterday, but were not but will b at the meeting Thursday but will be at the meting Thursday evening. The resignations of the two counciltnen were caused by the reason of the fact that the portion of the cl y In which they reside hms never been legally taken Into the corporate limit* of the city. An or dinance was passed taklag In the property In this section of the town, bat an investigation has disclosed that the streets and alters have nev er been dedicated to the city by The Sherman Park company which orig inally owned the land and which had It platted, and aold. BANK ROBBERS GET $17,000 Perpetrators Make Good Their Escape PORTLAND. Ore.. Dec. 8.—All ef forts of the officers to secure a trace of the three unmaake robbers who held up the East Side bank of this city last evening, and aecured 817, 000 In currency and made their es cape have ao far proved unsuccess ful. The robbery waa the boldest ever perpetrated In the city and the en tire town la shocked over the affair, and cannot understand how three un masked men could enter the bank at 6 o'clock In the evening, while scores of pedeatrlana ware on the streets, rob It and make their escape. President Newhall and his son, Rog er were In the hank at the time and were Just closing up tha even ing's bualnesa. One of the highway men, while the other covered the bank president and hla son, and the third stood watch at the door, en tering the bank proper, and took the bags containing the currency and then fled. Ae they made their ealt President Newhall and hla son fired alx shot* at them, but they did not take effect, and the robbers were aoon lost In the darkneaa. Many pedeatrlana It la Idarned today saw the robber* take tha money, but did not realise what bad happened until the alarm waa given by Presi dent Newhall. * The police have searched the whole city but have not aecured the slightest clue that would lead to the Identity, and apprehension of the robbers. One of the developments of the robbery today was tha finding of the horse and rig In which the robbers had made their escape. The rig waa found some distance from town where It had been abandoned, and an Investigation revealed that It bad been hired at a livery bam some time prior to the robbery. Two hun dred dollar* in money waa also found In the mud near the scene of the rob bery. It was wrapped up In a piece of paper, and had been dropped by the bandits as they were making their escape.
