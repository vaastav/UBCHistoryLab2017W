COVINGTON. DEC. G. 1884. Mrs. S.V. KENTZEL, Proprietress e W. G. KENTZEL....... EDITOR DMal Jnml of St. mauwy Puih, ISSUED EVERY SATURDAY I SUBSCRI'PTION RATES t One copy, one year.... ........$..S 00 One copy six months. ........... 00 1 One copy three months........... 50 - I The work of demolishing the old Courthouse commenced this week. I Mr. J. M. Siiamons has removed E to the town of Tangipahos, in our neighboring parish. The oyster boat arrived last Wed nesday evening, and we dou't want to see any more oysters for a week. Read the "Editor's Dream," on the first page. The man "'from up the creek" is always welcome. He is the smartest one of the lot. We learn that an Indian, by the name of Jackson, killed his wife, . one night this week, oi Bayou Cas taing, by stabbing her to death with a knife. There is a dangerous looking hole near the middle of the bridge across the gutter to the left of the FAuxun office. Referred to the Committee on Improvements. Several of our merchants .have received large supplies of Christ mas toys, and old Santa Clans will fine a good assortment to select from when he comes to town. Mr. C. M. Byrne, overseer at Sulphur Springs Plantation, in forms us that he made 42 barrels of syrup this year. Although the yield wsa very small, he says the syrup was the best ever made on the plan tation. There is a dangerous washout in the approach to the big bridge, on the Covington side of the river. This should be remedied before a serious accident occurs. The press and people of New Orleans are justly indignant over the cowardly assassination of Capt. Murphy. It wouldn't surprise uas if the assassins, when caught, were hung to the first lamp-pest, or shot down in their tracks. This would be in accordance with their own peculiar ideas of justice, although contrary to the forms of law as set forth in the Criminal Code. AuonaarHns! AuTOGronPHs! !-We still have on hand, for presentatiot, to those of our subscribers who have not yet received one, a few copies of our beautiful autograph, written in violet ink. All subscri bers who pay up their indebtedness will receive one of these handsome presents. Now is the time to pro cure them, and we are anxious that all our subscribers should have one to gaze upon and admire before Christmas comes. Miss Zuleika H. Cleveland, an accomplished and highly respected resident of St. Francisville, in the parish of West Feliciana, is a cousin of our newly-elected President. Miss Cleveland is a school teache r by occupation, and possesses rate scholastic and literary attainments, which frequently find vent in poet ical or prose contributions to the press. Thus far we have heard of no expression on the part of President Cleveland of his future intentions as to the disposition of the public officeas, except so faras the position of the "President's Barber" is con oerned-an office created by Presi dent Grant and continued by his successors. The President's bar ber has been carried on the Gov ernment rolls as a clerk in the Fourth Auditor's office, where he rendered no service, his time being principally occupied in the hair dressing and shaving of the Presi dent and his official household. The same barber has applied to Gov. Cleveland to be retained, who replied: "That's an office I will abolish. The Treasury Depart aent will not have to pay for my barber." This is another evidence of the fact that President Cleveland will give as an economical govern ment, and that he will allow no man to "soft soap" him for the sake of an office. 

EXHIBITS WANTED. We Lave received the following letter from our Parish Commission er to the World's Exposition: MANDEVILLE, LL, Dec. 4, 1881 All citizens of our parish are earnestly urged to aid in getting up and sending forward as credita ble and complete a display for the World's Industrial and Cotton Cen tennial Exposition as possible. We need specimens of titmber, lumber, brick, sand, pottery clay, moss, corn, oats, rice, sugar cane, hay, needle work, preserves, canned fruits, fowls, stock, agricultural products of all kinds, and anything rare or remarkable, in its natural state, or made by hand, which will attract attention to our parish, and show to the world her resources and capabilities. Please send your articles forward by the 13th inst., and direct all ex hibits to Hon. C. J. Barrow, Louis iana Commissioner, and at the time of shipping send a memorandum to the undersigned, to Lock Box 1506, New Orleans, giving a full description, so he can see that the article is in place and properly ac credited to the parish. Among the many and wonderful articles now in the Louisiana space, no specimen of live-oak or of very large pine is to be seen, and it is to be hoped that our parish can sup ply this deficiency. The exhibits are being placed in position rapidly, and the interior of the Exposition buildings are being filled up with stands and booths of unique and beautiful designs, which makes it attractive and bright beyond conception. GEO. MoORnaN, Parish Commissioner. It is to be hoped that our citi zens will aft promptly in this mat ter. Only a few days remain in which entries can be made, but out proximity to the city, and our transportation facilities, by rail road and by steam and sailing ves sels, will enable us in a very short space of time to forward a credita ble display. In addition to the ar ticles enumerated by the Parish Comwissioner, we might send samples of our mineral waters; and the shipyards at Madisonville should send models of the steam and sailing vessels built by them; our vineyards should also be repr, sented by samples of the various kinds of wine made in the parish, and the silk industry, although comparatively in its infancy, could make a very attractive exhibit; in the matter woman's work, there is one article alone of which hun dreds of ladies could forward speci mens, and we venture to say a more delicious article will not be found in the Exposition buildings-we refer to the products of the fig fig preserves and fig jelly; this would illustrate one of the possible industries of our parish in which a fortune awaits the enterprising in dividual who will embark in the business on a large scale. Our parish is sparsely settled, but we can make up in natural re sources what we lack in population, and by making an attractive and creditable display of the former, we w.ll soon secure the latter. Our.parish can and ought to make a fine display, and even if we are only half represented, our citi zeus, when they visit the great Ex position, will be proud to acknowl edge that they hail from "Old St. Tammany." The State Commissioner will pay the cost of transportation on all ex hibits that are sent to him, so all that is required is a little effort, on the part of our citizens, in collect. ing and forwarding a display to which we can point with feelings of pride. There is no time to be lost, however, and we hope that active operations will be commenced im mediately. The career of President-elect Cleveland, in many respects, has been one of the most remarkable in the history of our Union. Not infrequently have young men, of poor and humble origin, worked their way by slow and pains-taking steps o the highest place in the nation's gift, but it remained for Grover Cleveland to leap, as it were, acroes the gulf that sepa rates the highest and one of the lowest official positions. A few years ago he was the Sheriff of his county, and all that could be said of him then was that he was an humble officer, unknown even in adjoining eounties A lucky star seems to lead him, and to-day his name is spoken with familiarity in every home in America. He has, in all the positibns of trust which he has held, been honest and faith ful, and this seems to be the secret of his success. Rev. Ben Jenkins, convicted of the murder of Rev. J. Lane Borden, and sentenced to the Penitentiary for life, was conveyed to Baton < Rouge a few days ago, from Mans field. An intimate friend of President elect Cleveland, in New York, says the President-elect has ordered his clerks to destroy, without showing him, all letters from persons apply ing for office. 

CAPT. A. H. MURPHY SHOT TO DEATH. REcORDER FORD, HIS BROTHER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW, AND HIS COURT OFFIncus ARRaESTD FOR THE MURDER. Another cold-blooded assassina tion occurred in New Orleans last Monday evening. Capt. A. H. Murphy, in charge of a gang of prisoners from the Police Jail, was at work cleaning out the Claiborne Canal, when he was approached by two of Judge Ford's court officers, two citisens and a policeman. Without a word of warning they opened fire on Capt. Murphy, who returned the fire till he had emptied his revolver, when he retreated. fo:lowed by the men, who shot him to death. Upon information received, the following men have been arrested, charged with the murder: Record er Thomas J. Ford, his brother, Pat Ford, his brother iu-law, Po heeman John Murphy, and court officers Win. H.: Buckley, Charles Bader, Win. E. Caulfield and Louis Cerise, and J. V. Faveto, porter of Judge Ford's Court. The killing is supposed to be the result of a lfbel suit between Capt. Murphy a:nd Recorder Ford. The pr.soners all deny any knowl edge of the affair. Several witnesses have been ar rested and detained, who say they can identify the men who did the shooting. Capt Murphy was a cousin of Hon. E. John Ellis, and it is under stood that gentleman has signified his intention to assist in the prose cution of the assassius. PAT. EGAN SENTENCED TO BE HANUED. Judge Ronman, last Monday, over ruled the motion of Egan's counsel for a new trial, and proceeded to pass sentence on the prisoner, as f. ll,ws: Patrick Egan-Yours was an aggravated case of murder. The Court will not enter into the de tails of it, except to say that, not withstanding the efforts of your cuunsel, who did all he could in your behalf; notwithstanding also the presence in Court and the tes timony of your father and mother, who, parent-like-and naturally so -spoke as favorabl3 as was to be expected of them, for a son who has done so much to break their hearts-the trial jury having charge of your case brought in against you an unqualified verdict of guilty. You know what must necessarily follow such a verdict. Your life is to be the price of the life you have taken. Granting, as the Conr must, the correctness of the jury's finding in your case, the'correct ness of the law sustaining and com pleting it cannot for a moment be questioned. It is indeed a severe rule, but the tranquility of society, no less than the peace and dignity of the State, require its rigid en forcement. Patrick Egan, by virtue of sec tions 784 and 993 of the Revised Statutes of the State of Louisiana, and in accordance with the verdict of the jury rendered against you on the 25th of November, 1884, the Court sentences you to be hanged by the neck until you are dead, at such time and place as the Gover nor of the State shall direct. Egan looked very pale, but took ] his sentence calmly, and was at once removed to the condemned i cell. It will be remembered that Egan attended the execution of Eloi and Holland, on the 31st of July last, I and carried away in his pocket a piece of the rope with which they were hung, "for good luck." That very night he was incarcerated in the same prison where he had wit nessed the double execution, charged with the murder of George K. Blake, on Royal street, for which crime he is now sentenced c to be hanged. t Egan is personally known to c many of our readers, he having , spent the summers of '82 and '83~ at Abita Springs. a SHOT BY SISTERS. On Canal street, New Orleans, last Saturday evening, about half past eight o'clock, Georgians and Josephine Conway, two young and pretty women, aged respectively 22 and 20 years, shot Joseph Devon shire and John Lagan, two young men who had accomplished their ruin. The men were walking on Canal street, and when near the corner of Dryades, the young girls approached them from behind and tired simultaneously, Josephine, the younger, picking out Devon shire as her mark, and Georgiana selecting Lagan. One of the bul lets glanced along Devonshire's back, while the other penetrated Lngan's body, in close proximity to his spine. Devonshire sought safe ty in flight, followed by another shot, which missed him. Lagan turned and grasped Georgiana's pistol, and in the struggle that en sued the weapon was again dis charged, the bullet lodging in La gan's chin. The girls were arrested, and the wounded men taken to Charity Hospital, where it was found that Lagan's wounds were of a serious nature, but he will probably re cover. Devonshire's wound was slight, nothing more than a scratch. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. [Times-Democrat.1 The President's message contains a large number of very wise recom mendations, but suggests nothing very startling or any violent changes in our present laws. That portion of the message bear ing on the subject of our foreign relations is even less interesting than usual, due to the fact that the United States is on the fr endlicst te ms with all its neighbors, and is free from all complications and difficulties. The message, there fore, is devoted mainly to the con sideration of such matters as Co rea's donation of land for the Uni ted States consulate. the reeogni tion of the flag of the Congo Asso ciation, etc. The President favors the Hawaiian treaty, recommends its continuance, urges the passage by Congress of the measures uneces sary to place the Mexican recip rocity treaty into operation, and mentions in favorable terms the re ciprocity treaty with Spain by which the products of Cubanad Porto RicQ are admitted into this country free of duty. He urges certain changes in our neutrality and naturalization laws, and in ref erence to the salaries paid our dip lomat tie rnrnmen.tativ..n hrf'n Coming to our finances, the President finds that, with a reve nue of $348.519,869, we expended $290.916,483 the lst fiscal year, leaving a surplus of $57,603,386, wh.le the surplus of next year i estimated at $39,000,000. He takes a very strong position in opposi tion to the further coinage of silver dollars and the issuance of silver certificates. We are still coining silver, he shows, at the rate of $27, 000,000 a year, but nearly all of this is kept locked up in the Treas ury, less than 22 per cent. of it be ing in circulation. If this practice continues, Mr. Arthur remarks, si! ver will drive out gold and make it self the sole metallic standard of the country, to the great injury of our trade With other countries. In order to bring the silver dollars coined into circulation, the Presi dent joins with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending the withdrawal of the $1 and $2 bills from circulation and the substitu tion of silver in their place. He also urges the redemption by the Government of the non-current trade dollars, at a slight advance in value on the bullion they contain. He joins with Secretary McCul loch again in proposing the crea tion of a'commission to ascertain the most effective means of increas ing our foreign trade and relieving the depression under which our industries are now languishing; also the subsidy of lines of vesseli running from here abroad by the payment of large amounts for the transportation of our mails. If this is not done, it means, he believes, the complete destruction of Ameri can shipping. On the subject of the circulation of our National Bank notes, the President proposes that Congress shall allow banks to issue notes equal to the full amount of the bonds they hold. I reference to our army and naval affairs, he recommends an a ap propriation of $60,000,000 for barbjr defenses; the encourage ment of the pioduction of steel cannon aud other ordnance in this country; the building of more men of-war, and the restoration of our navy to its former high state of efficiency. - The recommendations made rela tive to the Postoflice Department are the reduction of the postage on drop-letters to one cent, and a change of the unit of standard in the mail to one ounce, instead of one-half ounce. The President congratulates the country on having successfully passed through the year without any trouble with the Indians, some-I ting wholly unprecedented in our history. On the subject of the Mor mons be is very aggressive and de termined, proposing that "Congress assume absolute political control of the Territory of Utah, and provide for the appointment of a commis sion, with such governmental pow ers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put into their hands." The message winds up with a very thorough consideration of the policy of the Government as re gards the extension of our foreign trade. His recommendations are a series of reciprocal commercial treaties with American countries, the improvement of our consular seorvice, the enactment of measures favoring the construction of steam carrying marine and the establish ment of a uniform cun rency through out America. Other recommendations are the passage of a national bankrupt law, a pension for Gen Grant, the pre servation of the forests on the pub lic domain, the granting of Govern ment aid for popular education, and the enactment of statutes in regard to filling vacancies in the Presider tial office. From among the many teefimo nials received we select the follow ing written by J. H. Carter, a resi dent of Phelps Co., Mo., who says: "I have used Sherman's
