London, Doc. 6 (by the Associat ed Press.) Tlie centuries-old quar rel between England und Ireland was ended In the small hours of Tuesday morning by tho signature In the premier's cabinet room of 'a treaty between Great Britain and Ireland," consisting of eighteen articles, giving Ireland the title of the Irish Free State, and the same constitutional status as Canada, Australia and other over-seas do minions. The question of allegiance, which had threatened to wreck tho nego tiations was surmounted by per mitting members of the Irish par liament to swear allegiance to the constitution of the lush tree stale and -be faithful to his majesty the King." Tno treaty has to run the gaunt let of the L'ister government and of tho imperial parliament, which hua been summoned to meet December 14. Approval by parliament is a foregone conclusion. The position of Ulster is less certain. Evidence cornea from Belfast that the treaty will be ''subjected to the most searching examination, and many modifications may be proposed. Premier Congratulated. The king hastened to send the premier a telegram congratulating him on the success of the negotia tions. The treaty was signed by all members of the British and Irish delegation participating, the Irish delegates signing their Gaelic names. Ireland Is treated as a single entity in tho treaty, with special clauses providing against the pos sibility that Ulster should refuse acquiescence in tho settlement tn which c&s'e the government of Ire land act of 1920 will remain in force so far as the northern parlia ment isf concerned, but with the stipulation that a special commis sion shall determine new boundar ies for northern Ireland. Provisions also are made for the co-operation of the two parliaments in providing certain safeguards in the event of Ulster remaining out of the free state. Neither parlia ment, however, will bo permitted to make laws endowing any particu lar religion, or to impose any re ligious disability. Military Defense Force. The treaty looks to Ireland in the future of undertaking its own coastal defense and provides that Ireland shall during war give tho British forces necessary harbor and other facilities. It further re cognizes the Irish free state's right to maintain its own military defense force. Premier Lloyd George is the re cipient of universal congratulations for having successfully rescued the negotiations. The general belief, however. Is that Lord Birkenhead is responsible for the formula over coming the allegiance difficulty. Austen Chamberlain, leader of the government in the house of commons and of the unionist party, speaking at Birmingham tonight expressed the conviction that before Christmas peace and good will would be established.

WAGE COURT PLAN OF HARDING IS OPPOSED BY SAMUEL GOMPERS Washington, Dec. fi.

"The president's message in most respects an admirable locument, the statement f'.iid, "but he, like tno many mem fails in his understanding of tliu relations between workers and employers, of the aspira tions which are in the hearts and minds ot tho great masi of our people. "Indeed the president's pro posal for the establishment of a court Willi legal powers to decide as to wages and condi tions of employment, is imth ing more nor less than a rever sion back to the conditions ob taining more than 40U year: ng" when the court of quarter sessions determined the wage; fit the workers and prohibited them from asking for mole or employers from paying mon than the court's decision ami to condemn men to compulsory servitude and slavery if they resented in any way the decis ions ot those courts."
