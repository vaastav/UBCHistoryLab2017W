CONCERNING CELERY. Principal I'opnlnr Vnrletles—lJleoeh lull nntl Winter Stornjje. At the lthode Island station a study has been made of the principal varieties of celery in cultivation in this country during the past fifty years. The prin cipal modifications that the celery plant has undergone in the last half century are found to be the greater localization of the fleshy growth in the center of the plant, self blanching tendencies and earlier maturity. According to Profess or Kinney, the varieties that have been recognized by growers as having spe eial merit are Sandringliam (Incompar able Dwarf). Boston Market. Golden Heart, White Plume, Rose. Paris Gold en and Giant Pascal. The Paris Gold en or Golden Self Blanching celery is the variety generally grown iu the local market garden of Rhode Islaud. Summarizing for the different sta tions. success has been oftenest report ed with White Plume. Paris Golden and Giant Pascal. The Paris Golden is preferred, according to the Rhode Island station, by marketmen because It never has the strong, bitter flavor sometimes present In White Plume not properly blanched. White Plume seems to be more resistant to the black heart disease than the Paris Golden. Giant Puscal Is one of the largest varieties grown. Blanching: 'With Earth or Boards. At the Pennsylvania station a test , was made on the relative merits of ■ blanching with earth and with boards. 1 In some cases celery blanched with boards was ready for market earlier than that blanched with soil, but the celery so blanched was decidedly In ferior and, as a rule, was long, slender, pithy and bitter, while that blanched with soil was exceedingly large, crisp and tender. Planting For Winter lie. C. R Waldron of the North Dakota station advises that celery for winter use planted In boxes, cellars or pits should have the roots pruned back to two Inches in length, and the bunches should also receive considerable top pruning, but the outer stalks should not be stripped off. White Plume Is the best variety so far for general eul ture. Gronn In Shade. The New Jersey station reports ex perlments iu shading young celery. Six varieties were tested in this way, and all grew to more than double-the size of other plants of the same lot that were In the full sun. but later lu the season, with shorter days and less light, the exposed plants overtook aud surpassed the shaded ones. rtnble American Women. Mrs. Alec Queedu, a prominent Eng lish woman, who visited the United Btates last winter, says "There in no doubt about it. English though I am, I candidly admit that American women, taken en masse, are j more affable iu manner and generally better educated than the average Eng lish woman.

I faticv that if questioned most peo ple would :i, tiun ;i sheet ~(■ paper •would not float for any h'tigth of tine* on Wat. r .mil ecituinly would not bear any weight. But experiment proves the contrary. Indeed the number of things that can In- done with floating paper will not only surprise old people, but will furnish amusement for chil dren.
