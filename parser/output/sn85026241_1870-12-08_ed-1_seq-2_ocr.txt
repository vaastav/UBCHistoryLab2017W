4MM Mm$nl fcijronicle T. CLAIRSVILUE, OHIO: THURSDAY MORMNCi. Dec. S, 1S7U, President's Message. 7b the Senate and House of Repreeniatice : A year of peace md general prosperity to luis nation lias passed siuco the ia assembling of Congress. We uav. through a kind Providence, beeu blessec. with ahuadaut crops, anil have beeu spared from complications and war witb foreign nations. In our midst compara tive harmony has been restored. It is to b regretted, however, that a free, ex ercise of the elective frauehi&e has by violence and intimidation bsen denied to citizens in exceptional cases, in sev eral of the States lately in rebellion, an J the verdict of the people has thereby been reversed. The States of Virginia. Mississippi and Taxas have been restor ed to representation in our national councils. Georgia, the only State now without representation, may confidently be expected to take ber place there also J at the beginning of the new year, and then let us hope will be completed the work of reconstruction, with an acqui esceuoe on the part of the whole people, i a the national obligation to Day the j public debt created as the price of ourj Union, the pensions to our disabled sf-i uiera and sailors and their widows antfJ orphans, and in the changes to the Con- : stitution, which have been made neces sary by a great rebellion. There id mm reason why we should not advance ; I material prosperity and happiness as uu other nation ever did afters protracted ? and devasting a war. Soon after the existing war broke out j in Kurope, the protection of the United 't Stales Ministry in Paris was invoked in i favor of the North Germans domiciled"; In French territory. Instructions were issued to grant the protection. This has been followed by an extension of Ameri can protection to the citizens of Saxony, Hesse andSaxe-Coburg-Gotha.Colombia Portugal, Uruguay, and the Dominican .Republic, Ecuador, Chili, Paraguay and Venezuela in Paris. The charge was an onerous one, requiring constant and se vere labor, as well as the exercise of pa tience, prudence and good judgment. It - has been performed to the entire satis faction of this government, and as I am officially informed equally so to the sa tisfaction of the government of North Germany. As soou as I learned that a republic had been' proclaimed at Paris, and that the people of France had ac-jl quiesced in the change, the Minister of 1 tho" United States was directed by tele- graph to recognize it, and to tender my congratulations and those of the people I of the United States. Theestablishrreut in France of a system of government disconnected with the dynastic tradi nous of Kurope appeared to be n proper subject for the felicitation of Americans. 1 Should the present struggle result in attaching the hearts to our simpler forms of representative government, it will be ' a subject of still further satisfaction to ' our people. While we make no effort to impose our 1 institutions upon the inhabitants of other countries, and while we adhere to our traditional neutrality in civil contests ' elsewhere, we cannot be indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in a great and highly civilized country likej ' Franc. We were asked by the newi' government to use our good offices jointly with those of European power in the , iuterest bf peace. Answer was made I that the established policies and the true if interests of the United Stat s forbade j them to interfere in European questions. Jointly with European powers, I ascer- r mined unofficially that the Government of North Germany-was not disposed to J listen to such representations from any v wwers, and though earnestly wishing to j ii see the blessings of peace restored to Uie ; a belligerents, with all of whom the Uni-i" ted States are on terms of friendship, I ii declined on the part of this Government o to take a step which could only result n in injury to our true interests, without advancing the object for whit h our in- ti tervuiitiou was invoke . Should the -time come when the action of tiie United R States can hasten the return of peace by single hour, that action will be heart- w ily taken. I deemed it prudent, in view tl of the number of persons of Germau n and French birth living in the United $1 States, to issue soon -.fter official notice oi of a state of war had been Tereived from d both belligerent?, a proclamation delin ic ing the duties of the United States as a ' neutral and the obligations of persons p residing within this territory to o servo si their laws and the law of nations. The Ot proclamation was followed ci The properties and the requisition of ft their revenues by the executive warrant a such proceedings. ' As far as they affect- W ed the persons or property of citizens of el to United States, they were in viola- fu tion of the provisions of the treaty of ot 1785, between the United Stales and at Spain. Representations of the injuries tl resulting to several persons claiming to tl be citizens of the United Stales, by rea- ei sons of such violations, were made to ai the Spanish government from April, is 1869, to June last. The Spanish Minis- it ter at Washington had been domed tr with a limited power to aid in redress ni ing such wrongs. That power was found i W to be withdrawn, in view, as it-was said, I of of the favorable situation iu which thejcl Island of Cuba then was, which, how-jm - ever, did not lead to a revocation Orsus- ?li pension Of the extraordinary and a bi- sli trary functions exercised by the execu- B tive power in Cuba, and were obliged to it make our complaint at Madrid, in the Ci negotiation thus opened and stili pcnd it ing there the United States only claimed p that foi the future the rights secured to la their citizens by treaty should be re- ci! s pec Bed in Cuba, and that as to the da a joint tribunal should be established iu foi the United States, with full jurisdiction wi over all such claims and before such ml- lit partial tribunal, each claimant would oe cil required to prove bis case. Onthedtuur tli hand, Spain would be at liberty to trsv- In era every material fact, and tuus com- tic plete equity would be done. - A case ea wbic'i at one time threatened seriously to to affect the relations between tine Um- mi - ted States and Spaiu, has already beeu rei disposed of in this way. The claim at thi the Col. Lloyd, of Aspm wall, for the il- a c legal seizure and detention of that ves- wi ei, was referred to an arbitration by for mutual consent, and has resulted iu an &n award to the United States for t he-own- cx ers of the same, of $19,702,50 in gold, q"1 Another and a long pending claim of act like nature, that of the uhaleship Can- upi ada, bas been disposed of by friendly ar- the titration during the present year. It cor was referred by the joint consent of Bra- Aoi ail and the United States, to the decis- go, ion of Sir Edward Thornton, her Brit- mi( tanic Majesty's Minister at Washington fr' who kindly undertook the laborious task sub of examining the voluminous mass of api correspondence and testimony submit- ' ted by the two Governments and award- tat' ed to the United States the sum of one e,P hundred thousand sev m hundred and Un forty dollars and nine cents iu geld, cau which has never been paid by the Im- Pr perial Government. on i These recent examples show that the 'ess mode which the United States have pro- con posed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible, aud -that it bill may be agreed to by either nation with- of t out dishonor. It is to be hoped that this oi moderate demaad may be acceded to by the Spain without further delay. Should ed, the pending nevoiiafiuns unfortunately ' ' and unexpectedly be without result, it "ei; will then become my duty tocommuni- '"ju eate that fact to Congress and invite its tel action on the subject. The long deferred w,1 peace conference between Spain and the "or allied South American republics lias "av been inaugurated in Washington under 6w the auspices of the United States. Pu r- are suant to the recommondationscontained " '' in tbe resolution of the House of Bepre- UP sontatives of the I7th of December, 1886, 1 the Executive Department of th Gov- are 1 ernment offered its friendly offices for Mar the promotion of peace and harmony be- jl tween Spain and the allied repuljjcs, '"M but obstacles occurred to the acceptable' 1 Of tbe offer. Ultimately, however, alrm- that hav j fereuce was arranged aud was opened t in this city on the 29th of October last, I at wiiicn authorized tbe Secretary of 5Ute to preside. It was attended by I ; the Ministers of -?pain, Peru, Chili and j ! Hqnador, aud hi w eequouce of tho absence of the representative from J 1 ilivia, the conference was adjourned i . : til the attendance of the plenipotent. uv from that Bay Wk couid be secured, orj : ntuer meobures could be adopted towards i . ompassing its object. The al.'ied and ' the republics of Spauiah origin on this jcoutineut may see in this fact a new1 proof of our si ucsre interest in their wel- iare our desire to see them blessed with i a good government capable of main taining order and preserving their re spective territorial integrity, and of our ; mucere wish to extend our own commer ioial and social relations with them. The i i time is not probably far distant when, i in the umuial course of events, tbe Eu- i ro.iean p.ilitical connection with this i ; colilineut will cease. Our policy should i : be shaped in view of this probability, so i M to atly tho commercial interests of the i : Spanish American Slates more closely i to our own, and thus give the United . states all the pre-eminence and all the i advantages which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Ad- I ams and Mr. JJlay contemplated when j they proposed to join to tne Congress or Pauama. During the last session of Con- i Kress a treaty lor tbe annexation of the Republic ot San Domingo to that of the I Uuited Stales tailed to receive the requi- t site t-.vo-iiiii.i- vote of the Senate. I was llMHimg;lil convinced then that tbe best I interests f theountry commercially t and materially demanded its ratification, t t ime has omy eoMtSraaed me in this r view, i now II mly i.eiieve that the t manrgi it is known that ine U.

In the !ay it s-amaiirt a mrn otuinercial city t u n; spring au, to won-n we will be trib- B tilory without rseoiviag corresponding t oeuelits. l'htt northern Senators who L are responsible tor the folly of our rejec- n tion so agreed. The government of San ti Domingo has voluntarily sought this annexation. It is a weak power, num bering probably less than one hundred and twenty thousand souls, and yet pos p sessing one of the richest localities under i tbe sun, capable of supporting a popula- t tion of ten millions of people, in luxury, n The people of San Domingo are not ca- t pable of maintaining themselves in their a present condition, and must look for Ii outside support. They yearn for the t protection of our free institutions and ft laws, our progress aud civilization. Shall h we refuse them t Tho acquisition of San li Domingo is desirable because of its geo- c graphical position. It commands the st iii'rance to the Carribean Sea, and the pi isthmus transit of commerce. Itposse?s- ol if the richest soil, the best and most ca- ai tacious harbors, the most salubrious la -limate and the most valuable products do f the forest, mine and soil of any of the M W est India Islands. si Its possession by 'lie United Stales u will in few years, build up a coastwise of ommerce .-f immense magnitude, which sa will (i" towards restoring to the fo L'nited St.i'es our merchant marine. It o "rill give to us tboso articles which we at ousider greatly necessary and do not re irluce, IhUB equalizing our exports fa ind imports. Iu case of a foreign war d t will give us command of all tho is- tl, anils referred to, and thus prevent an gt Miemy from j-ain possessing himself of ai I rendezvous upon our coast. Our coast U rade betweei. tho States bordering on pi he Atlautic and those bordering on the bo ulf of Mexico is by the Bahamas and th he Autilles twice. We must, as it were au ass through foreign countries to get by sit r m Georgia to the east coast of Klori- lb la San Domingo, with a stable govern- to neat undr which hor immense resour- W f can be developed, will give renin- eu iprafive wages-to ten thousand laboiers th mt now upon the island. This labor m kill take advantage of every available pri jeans of transportation to abandon the coi djacent islands and seek the blessings Br f iieedoui and its sequence, each iu- thi abitaut receiving' the rewards of his mm wn labor. Porto Rico and Cuba will au ave to abolish slavery, a- a measure of tin df-prescrvation to retain their laborers, coi an Domingo will become a large con- m liner ofthe products of northern farms an nd manufactories. The cheap rate at pu hich iier citizens can be furnished wa ilh food owing to the cultivation oi du; 10 island by machinery, vill make it ma ecessary that the contiguous islands Qn lould have the same advantages, in bet rder to compete with them in the pro- gu uction of sugar, coffee, tobaccco, trop- of t al fruits, arc. This will open to us a ev ider mat set for our products The the roduclionsof our own supply of these ule -tides will c t off more than $100,000,- ed K) o o:ir annual imports, besides iu- ti oi easing our exports. With such a pic- (he ire, it is easy to see how our iarge debt tob road is ultimately to be extinguished, ing 'ith a balance of trade against us in- an titling the interest of bonds held by oft ireiguers, aud the money shipment of Tin ir citizens traveling in foreign lands to 1 ual to the yield of precious metals in of I us country, it is not so easy to see how ins lis result is to beolherwise accomplish- aut I. The acquisition of San Domiugo is Cai i adhesion to the Monroe Doctrine. It im a measure of na ional protection, and ega is asserting our just claims to a con- . nllinjr influence over the great com- or ercial traffic soon to flow fiom the pre 'est to the East by way of the Isthmus tak Darien. His to build up our iner- age lant marine. It is to. furnish uew den arkHs f.irthe products of our farms, this lops and manufactories. It is to make was very insupportable in Cuba aud Porto har ico at once, and ultimately so in Brazil, wit is to settle the unhappy condition of Go ibs, and end an exterminatingcouflict. miu is to provide the honest means of and ving our honest debts without over the xing the people. It is to furnish our autl , izei s with the necessaries of every ves y life at cheaper rates than ever be- mill re, and it is, finally, a rapid stride to- or h inls that greatness which the intel- the :ence, industry and enters rise ofthe on o izeuB of the United Slates entitles and is country to assume among nations, ary view of the importance of this ques- give m, I earnestly urge upon Congress pari rly action, expressive of its views as ofai the best means of acquiring San Do bore ingo My suggestion is, that by joint pira toiution of the two houses of Congress, licei Executive be authorized to appoint the" ommission to negotiate for a treaty forft th the authorities of Sail Domingo," It the acquisition of that Island, that tion appropriation be made to defray the nte I penscs of such a. commission. I he to ei ration may be then determined by the tate ion of the - two Houses of Congress- Proti tin a resolution of annexation as in ijnit ( case of the acquisition of Texas. So n . ivinced am I of the advantages to v from the acquisition of San Domin- y?s? and of tlie great d vantages, we ?ht almost say, calamities, - to flow ,c' P in non-acquisition, that I believe the eePt. ject has only to be investigated to be Pai'"i iroved. and ( t is to be regretted that our represen- ight ons in regard to the injuries effected, ror t ecially upon the revenues of the ahd v itedptates, by Uie policy of the Mex- withi government in exempting from im- js nol t duties a 1 rge tract of its territory jur borders, havanot.oply been fruit- te5 but lhat it iseven proposed in that ,; ntry to extend the limiis within ' icIl the privilege adverted to has lerto been enjoyed. The expediency J, akinj into your serious considera- tt . i the proper means for counteracting 'l w" policy referred to, will it ispresum- ,v'8 engage your earnest attontion. It euce tlieobvious interests, especially of of 181 jhboring nations, to provide against scd ti ry to those who may have commit- of tin high crimes within their borders. and of cai may have sought refuge abroid. Maje this purpose extradition treaties limit e been concluded with several ofthe that i tral American Republics, and others bpk n in progress. The sense of Congress R,' h ireired as soon as may be convenient , 11 the proceedings of the Commission oot" he claims against Venezuela, which exceF nommenterl on in the messages of Plose ch 4th, 1S69, March 1st, J870 and 8Rld f oh . 31st, 1870. It has not ' beer; tl,e P ned adviambl to distribute any of venc moiipy which has boen receive! from conde government until Congress shall cargo acted upon the subject. ideuti The massacres of the French and Rus sians rtsideuts at Tein-Tsin, under cir-eum.-tances of great barbarity, were sup posed by some to have beeu premedi tated, and to indicate a purpose among the pocclaea to exterminate foreigners hi Chinese Empire. The evidence . establish such a supposition, but Lufft a complicity by the local authori ueswith themob. The government at Pekin, however, seems to have been de posed to fullnl its treaty obligations so far as it was able to do. Unfortunately the news of the war between tne German states and France reached China soon ifter the massacre. It would app r that the popular mind became possessed 1 with the idea that this contest, extend- i ng to tho Chinese waters, would iiuro bam the Christian influence and power, ! ind that the time was coininir when the) mperstitious mas might expel all for-; signers and restore the mandarin influ Mice. Anticipating trouble from this1 ause. I invited France and North Ger-, nany to make an authorized suspension Mf hostilit-es in the East, wiiere they : -ere temporarily suspended by the act i f the commanders, and to act together or the future protection in t'hina of the ives and property of Americans and j Europeans. Since the adjournment of Congress, the j atification oi the treaty with Gieatj jritain for the abolishing of the mixed j tourts for the suppression of the slav.- rade, is now confined to the eastern j oast of Africa, when the slaves areta-i ten to the Arabian markets. The rati-' ication of the naturalization convention etween Great Britain and the United i tates bas also been exchanged during be recess; and thus a long standing dis- j mte between the two governmentsJias een settled in accordance with the prin iples always counted for by the United i itates. in April last, while engaged in loca-1 ing a military reservation near Ptinbi- a, a corps of engineers discovered that' he commonly received boundary line: etween the United States and the Bnt-; h possessions at that place is about I fty-seven hundred feet south of the I ue position of the zenith parallel, and - at the line, when tun on what is now tipposed to be the true position of that aralell, would leave the Fort Hudson 1 1 ay Company at i'embiua within the jl srritory of the United States. This iu-: l irmation being comuuiuaied to then tritisb Government I was requested to jnseut, and I did consent that the i j iritish occupation ofthe port by the ( iddson Hay Company should continue , ir the present, i derm it important. , owever, that this part of the boundary ( ne should be definitely fixed by ajoint L mmissiun ofthe .overnments, and j ibmit herewith estimates of the ex- 1 ;nse of such a commission on the part 1 the United States, and recommend 1 i appropriation for that purpose. The 1 nd boundary is already fixed aud arked from the Summit of the Rocky r euulaius to the Georgian bay. it s loold be in like manner marked from I le Lake of the Woods to the Summit g the Rocky mountains. 1 regret to , .v that no conclusion has been reached , r the adjustment of tbe claims against , reat Hruaiu, growing out of the course ! j lopted by that government during tho U bajllun. The Cabinet of Loudon, so r as its views have beeu expressed,! es not appear to be willing to concede at her Majesty's government wjsjj' liny of negligence, or did or permitted -lyac during the war by which the I 'I uited Stales has just cause of com-111 aim. Ever firm aud unalterable ourlri uvict.ions are directly the reverse, aud j ii erelore, we recommend to Congress to j ti thorize the appointment of a commis- tl iu to take proof of tbe amounts : ml c e owtiership f their claims, on notice j, the representative of his Majesty atiw ashinglou, aud that authority be giv- j. lor the settlement of these claims by j . s Uuited States, so that the govern- . mt shall have the owuership of the vate claims as well as the repouible ilrol of all thje demands against Great K itain. It cannot be necessary to add w it whenever Her Majesty's govern- B :nt shall eutertaiu a desire for a full P j friendly adjustment of these claims, gi j Uuited Stales will enter upon their w is. delation with an earnest desire foi je oiictusion consisteut with the honor A i dignity of both nations. The couia: th rsucd by the Canadian authoiities to- al rd the fishermen of the United Stale ge -ing the past season bas not beeu w rked by a friendly feeling. By the t ar'icie of the convention of 1818, , ween Great Britain and the United ut tee, it was agreed that the inhabitants re he Uuited States should have for- an :r, in common with British subjects, P'' right of taking fish in certain waters an rein defined, iu the water not inciud- co iu ihe limits uamed in the conveu- Pa j, within three miles of the ports of an British coast, It hi sheen the cus- Ci l for mauy years to give to men trad- tU( and fishermen ofthe United States tje HiMiisabie warning of their violations a he technical rights of Great Britain. au i imperial government is understood . lave delegated the whole or a share in he jurisdiction and control of the ide fishery grounds to the colonial "1! bority known as the Dominion of sa' tada, aud this tciui-independent but tic sponsible agent has exercised its del- ex ted powers iu an unfriendly way. lai isels have been seized without notice res varning in violat ion of the custom ret vieusly prevalent, aud have been coi en into the colonial ports, their voy- sp i broken up, and the vessels cor. ined. There is reason to believe that i unfriendly and vexatious treatment . designed to bear harsnly upon the Jy fishermen of .the United States, ? Ii a view to political effect upon this lts ernment. Thy statutes of the Do- P0! ion of Canada assume a still broader rei1 moer untenable jurisdiction over she vessels of the Uuited States. They ofi lorize officers and persons to bring the els hovering within three marine roil ?s ofanyofthe coasts, bays, creeks Mil arbors of Canada, into port, to search fl0i cargo, and to examine the master, wn ath, touching the cargo and voyage, cne to inflict upon him a heavy pecuui- ra penalty if true answers were not gea u; and if such a vessel is found pre- .. ng to fish within three marine milts J , ly such coasts, bays, creeks or har- 001 , without a liceuse, or after the ex- l 0 tion ofthe period named in the last ,n" ise granted to it they provide that we! vessel with her tackle, &c, shall be mei dted. tice is not known that any coudetnua-' sist 5 have been made under this stat- pro yy the authorities of Canada, altho' C i force it it will become my duty to to such steps as may be necessary to at t ;ctthe rights of the citizens ofthe we edStates. it has been ciajmed by moi Majestty's oflicers that the fishing to ( ils ofthe United States have no rep to enter the open ports of the Brit- mei ossessions in North America, ex- enc for the purpose of shelter and re- Shv ng damages, ot purchasing w ood are iblaining water, that they have no the to enter at British Custom Hoases, fort i trade, except the purchase of wood affa vater ; aud that they m ust depart shai n 24 hours after notice to leave. It twe ; known that any seizure of a fish- Jap C3sel carrying the flag of the Uni- con States has been made under this recc . So far as the claim is founded, line y alleged construction ofthe con- will on of 1818, .cannot be acquiesced in ed u e United States. It is hoped that vess 1 not be insisted on by Her Majes- witl ioverntnent. During the confer- is which preceeded the negotiations thar 18, the British commission propo- som j expressly exclude the fishermen they United States from the privilege Tl Tying on trade with any of Ilcr laid sty's subjects residing within the pres i assigned for their use; and also this t should not be lawful for the ves- cost f the United States engaged is such fishery to have on board any will i. wares, or merchandize, whatever,- high t 6iich as mav be necessary for the at he cution of their voyage to aud from at th ishinggrounds ; and any vessels of earl) nitcd States which shall contra- now this regulation may be seized, strut mued and confiscated, with their trora Thjs proposition, which is the o cai with the construction now put to th upon the language of the Convention, was emphatically regretted by the Brit ish plenipotentiaries, and article one, as I it stands iu the Convention, was substi tuted. If. however, it be soid that this claim is founded on provincial or colo nial statutes aud not upon the Conven tion, this Government cannot but re gard them as uufriendlv, and in contra vention of the faithful executiou of which the Imperial Governmeut is alone responsible. Anticipating that an attempt may possibly be made by the Canadian authorities ia the coming ses sion, to repeal these unneighborly acts towards our fishermen, I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power to suspend by proclamation the operations ofthe laws authorizing the transit of goods, wares and merchan dize in bonds across to the territory of the United Staicsand Canada; and fur ther, should such an extreme become ne cessary to suspend its operations and any laws whereby Ihe vessels of the Dominion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the United Stales. A like unfriendly disposition bas been manifested on the part of Canada in the maintenance of a claim ot the right to exclude tbe citizens of the United Stales from the navigation of the St. Law rence. This river constitutes a natural outlet to the ocean, with au aggregate population of about 17,600,000 iuhabi boijoOi with Jan aggregate tonnage of 'ons upon the waters, which dis charge into the foreign commerce of our ports which are open to British compe tition, and the major part of it is done in British bottoms. If the American j seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean, by the monopoly; of the direct commerce of the lake ports, then the Atlantic would be in foreign bands, their vessels on the traus-Atlau-! tic voyages having an access to our lake! ports, which would be denied to Amcr lean vessels, on similar voyages. To state such a proposition is to refute its: justice. During the Administration of! Mr. John Quincy Adams. Mr. Clar un-j juestionably demonstrated the national j right of the citizeus ofthe U. States to I he navigation of this river, rlaiming! hat Ihe act ofthe Cougrcss of Vienna, opening the I'hinc and other rivers to! ill nations, showed Ihe judgment of the European jurists and statesmen to !e bat the innhabiutits of a country hro, vhich a navigrble river passes, have a I i at lira I right to enjoy the navigation of hat river to and into the 6ea, even tho" lassing thro' the territory of another owcr. This right does not exclude that o-equal right of the sovereign posses ing the territory thro' which the river lebouchcs into t lie sea. to make such i egulations relative to the policy of the lavigation, as may be reasonably neces- I ary; but those legulattotis should be rained in a liberal spirit of comity, aud hould not impose needless burdens t i pdn the commerce which has the right t f transit. It has been found iu prac- i ice more advantageous to encourage I liese regulations by mutual agreement. he U.S. are ready to make any reason- ble arrangement as to the police ofthe I it Lawrence, which will be suggested y Great Britain. If the claim by Mr. ; lay wasjust, when the population of ie States bordering on the shores of! ( je lakes was only 2,400,000, it now de- ves greater force aud equity from the t icreased population, wealth, produc- r on and tonnage of the States e ie .Canadian frontier. Since Mr. 1 lay adduced his arguments in be- c ill' of our rights, the principle for ( hich he contended has been frequent- c ' and by various nations recognized by p w or by treaty, and has been extended p i several of the great rivers. By the f caty concluded atMayence in 1831,the a hine was declared free trom the point p here it is first navigable iuto.thesea. a y the couvention between Spaiu and tl artugal, concluded in 1835, the uavi- a ition of the Dour, throughout its p hole extent was made free for tbe Sub- I cts of both countries. In 1S53, the a rgetitine Contederatiou by treaty b rew open for free navigation the Par ia aud Uraguay to the merchant ves- Is of all nations. In 185G the Crimean A ir wasclosed by a treaty which provi- jt d for the free navigation of the Dan- ti ie. In 1853 Bolivia by a treaty decla- as d that it regarded the rivers Amazon d d La Platte, in accordance with fixed te incipies of natural law, as highways ni d channels opened by nature for the si tnmerce of all nations. In 1859 the le raguay was made free by a treaty, m d in December, 1866, the Emperor of pi azil by an imperial decree declared a 3 Amazon to be open to all the frou- a r of Brazil to the merchant ships pf m nations -The greatest liviug British m thority on that subject, while assert- tr r the abstract right of the British w ims says that it seems difficult todeny Ik it Great Britain may ground her refu- gi upon strict law, but it is equally dif tilt to deny, first, that in so doing she so crciscs, harshly an extreme and hard ni r. Secondly, that her conduct with m pect to the navigation ofthe St. Law- tc ice is a glaring and discreditable fas isisteucy with her conduct with re- oi ict to the navigation ofthe Mississip- iy iver. On the ground that she pos- en sed a small domain in which the Mis- an iippi took its rise, she insisted on the pr ht to navigate the whole volume of va waters. On the ground that she rei sessed both banks of the St. Law- W ce where itdisembogues into the sea, pr denies to the United States the right tin lavigation through about one-half of waters of Lakes Ontario, Erie, Ha- sh i and Supcior, and the whole of Lake tin 3higan, through which the river cai vson the property of theU. S. The to ole nation is interested in securing '. ap transportation from theagricultu- wl States by this river to the Atlantic cei board. To the citizens of these States are scures a greater return for their la- Ics ; to the inhabitants of the seaboard Th flers cheaper food ; to the nation an in ;rest in the immense surplus of for ilth. It is hoped that the Govern-. S2. it of Great Britain will sec tWe jus- insj of abandoning her new and incon- for ent claims, to which her Canadian the vinces have urged her adherence. $9i ur depressed commerce is a subject pei vhich I called your special attention ma tie last session, and suggested that nai would in the future have to look wil c to the countries south of us, anil nei yhina and Japan for its revival. Our tio resentatives to all these Govern- vea its have exerted their influence to Co: onrage trade between the United the tesand those countries to which they rep accredited ; but the fact exists that Th1 carrying is done almost entirely in but lign bottoms, and while this state of its irs exists we cannot control our due tha e of the commerce of theU. S. be- rep en the Pacific States and China and con am It is all the carrying trade now and rlucted in American vessels. 1 wo'd inci immend a liberal policy towards that mai of American steamers oue that thy insure its success aud ever increas- ent sefulncss.

The condition of the archives of i c Department of State calls lor tho abrc ' action of Congress. The building fore rented by that department is a frail T ture, at an inconvenient distance Post the Executive mansiou, and from facti ther departments. It is ill adapted Wit e purpose for which it is used, has tion inot the, capacity to accommodate the I archives, and is not fire-proof. Its re-I mote situation, its slender construction, i uiud the absence of a supply of water iu the neighborhood leaves but little hope of safety for either the building or its contents in case of the accident of a fire. Its destruction would involve the loss of the rolls containing the original acts and resolutions of Congress, of the his ! torical records of the Bevolution, of the i confederation, of the whole series of di- ' plomatic and eoMalai archives since the adoption of the constitution, aud of the mauy other valuable records and papers left with that department when it was i the principal depository of the great ar- , chives. 1 recommend an appropriation for the construction of a building for j the Department of State. I recommend j to your reconsideration the propriety , I of transferring to the Department of the i I Interior, to which they seem more ap- i i propriately to belong, all powers and i j other duties in relation to t!.e lerrito- I ries with which the Department ot State is now charged by law or usage ; and ( from the Interior Department to flic s War Department the Pension Bureau, so far as it regulates the payment of sol- diers' pensions. I would further recom- t mend that the payment of nava! pensions i be transferred to one of the Bureaus of i t he Navy Department. Ths estimates t for the expenses of the Government for e the fiscal year are $18,241,346.01 less than j for the current one, but exceed the ap- a propriation for the present year, for the i c same items, 8,972.127.56. In this esti- ; e mate, however, is included $22,338,278.- j f 37 for public works heretofore begun a under Cougressional provision, and of t which only so much is asked as Con- ! p gress may choose to give. The appro- t priatioti lor the same works for the pres eat fiscal year was $11,984,518.08. The j a average value of gold as compared with j o National currency, for the whole of the j t year 18(i9. was about 1.34. and for II ci months of 1870 the relative value has ! t beeu about 1.15. The approach to specie ! d basis is very gratifying, but the fact f cannot be denied that the instability of I the value of our currency is prejudicial s to our prosperity and tends to keep up t! prices to the detriment of trade. The ii evils of a depreciated and fluctuating g correal y are so great that, now when b the premium on gold Iws fallen so much, j g it would seem that the time has arrived d when, by wise and prudent legislation, ei Congress should look to a policy which p would place our currency at par with w gold at no distant day. s: The tax collected from the people has been red need more than eighty million n dollars per annum. By a sleadincss iu p our present course there is no reason e why iu a few short years, ihe national si tax gatherer may not disappear from the Ii ioor ofthe citizen almost entirely. T With the revenue stamp dispensed by ci the postmasters in every community, a tl: tax upon liquors ot all sorts and tobacco tl; naJI its forms, and by a wise adjust- m nent of the tariff, which will put a duty j tli mly upon ihose articles which one co'd I fc lispense with, known as luxuries, aud re hose which we use' more of than we h iroduce, revenue enough may be raised ar ifter a few years of peace and consc- ' sii juent reduction of our indebtedness, to J m nllili all our obligations. A further re- w luttion of expense in addition to a re- he luction ofthe interest account may be m elied on to make this practicable. Rev- th nne reform, if it means this, has my di learty support; if it implies a collection so if all the revenue for the support of the Jovernment, on the payment of the prin- ac ipal aud interest of he public debt, Oi lensions, &.. by directly taxing the ta; eople, then I am against revenue re- 2.1 orm. and confidently believe the people m: re with me. Il" it means a failure to ra rovide the necessary means to defray in II the expenses ofthe Government, and otl liereby a repudiation of the public debt tin nd pensions, then I am still more op- co osed to such kind of revenue reform, du levenue reform has not been defined by ha ny of its advocates, to my knowledge, ful ut seems to be accepted as something tin 'hich is to supply every man's wants tin 'ithoutauy cost or effort ou his part. set i true revenue reform cannot be made mn i a day, bnt must be the work of BO- lav onal legislation and of time. As soon sul i the revenue can be dispensed with all un uty should be removed from coffee, ma a and other articles of universal use, on 3t produced by ourselves. The neces- till ties of the country compel us to col- wit ct revenue Irom our imports. Onr ar- res y of assessors and collectors is not a Th "easant sight to the citizen, hut that or pui tariff for revenue is necessary. Such to I larifl, so far as it acts in the encourage- tin: ent to home products, affords employ- for ent to labor at living wages, in coil- erjl ast to Ihe pauper labor of the old tor orld, and also in the development of stai une resources. Under the ar t of Con- to I ess of the loth day of July, 1870. gar The army has gradually been reduced, upc that ou'the 1st of January. 1871, the tha imber of commissioned officers and chii en will not exceed the number con- Ion mplated by law. mei The War Department building is an is u :1 structure, not fire-proof, aud entire- por iuadequate in dimensions to our'prcs- whi t wants. Many thousands of dollars The 3 now paid annually for the rent of ofo ivate buildings to accommodate the the riou3 bureaus of the Department. I vitc :ommend an appropriation for a new peri ar Department building suited to the rcac esent and growing wants ofthe na- the ii. lief I 'he report of the Secretary of War tion jws a very satisfactory reduction in sign ! expenses ofthe army for Ihe last fis- tied year. For details 1 you are referred The his accompanying report. ly p "he expenses' of the navy for the shoi iole;of the last year, that is, from De- man nber, 1869, the date of the last report, Goo i less than $19,000, or about $1,000,000 to tl s than they were the previous year. ed e expenses of the Navy Department apat this fiscal year, since July 1st, show for the five months a decrease of over Stat '100.000 from those of the correspond- amp ; mouths of last year. The estimates for t the current year were $28.205,678.37 ; wor se for next year are $20,083,317, witn the (7,000 additional for temporary and shot maneut improvements. These esti- the tes are made closely for the mainte- pre icc of the naval establishment as it is, swai bout much iu the nature of perma- Stab it improvements. The appropria- land ns were made for the last and current lege irs, and were evidently intended by or i gress, and are sufficient only to keep act c navy on its present footing, and the plen airing and refitting of our old ships, veyc is policy must, of course, gradually year surely destroy the navy, aud it is in dene ilf far'from economical, as each year 279,3 t it is pursued the necessity for more and airs in 9hips and navy yards, &c, be- an a les more imperative and more costly, I acre; I our current expenses are actually like rcascd fo.i the mere repair of ships, Tli iy of which must soon be unscawor- in bt and useless. I hope during the pres- ment session of Congress to b able to yean mit to it a plan by which naval ves- Illin can be built ahd repairs made with Mil I it saving upon the present cost.

I recommend the authorization by Congress to the Postmaster General and Attorney General to issue all commis sions to officials appointed through their respective Depart scente. At pre sent, these commissions, where appoint ments are made, aic issued by the State Department. The law in all the de partments the government, except those of the Poet -office and Justice, luthorizes each to iaua its own com missions, always favoring practical re forms. I respectfully call your attention to Jnc abuse of long standing, which I would like to see remedied by this Jongress. It is a reform in the civil ;erviec of the country. 1 would have t go beyond the mere fixing of- the erm of office of clerks and employes tvhodo not require the advice and con leut of the Sejiate to make (heir ap lointmeuts complete. 1 would have it rovern. not the tenure, but the manner it making all appointments. There is 10 duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of departments as hat of appoiutments nor is there any tich arduous and thankless labor ira loscd on Senators and Representatives s that of finding places for constitu nts. The present system does not : ecure the best men. and olten not even it men for public place. The elevation nd purification of the civil service of he Government will be hailed with ap- i iroval by the whole people of the Uui ed States. Helorni in the management of Indian : flairs has received the special attention ! the administration from its inaugara- 1 ion tothe present day. The experiment , f making it a missionary work was , tied with a few agencies given to the . enominatiou of Friends, and has been siind to work most advantageously. , ill agencies and superintendencies not 0 disposed of were given ti" officers of ( ie army. Tee net of Congress reduc- i lg the army renders army officers incli- i ible for civil positions. Indian agencies I eing civil officers, I determined to s ive all the agencies to such religious 1 cnominations as heretofore establish- 1 1 missions among the Indians, and I erhaps to some other denominations J ho would undertake the work on the j ime terms, L e. as a missionary work. The societies sele"ted are allowed to line their agents, subject to the ap- " roval of the Executive, and are expect- 1 to watch over .aud aid them as mis onaries and christians, and civilize the s idian and train him in the arts of peace. (. he Governmeut watches over the offi- r al acts of these agents and requires of I icm as strict an accountability as if e ey were appointed iu any other man- u tr. I entertain the confident hope a at the policy now pursued will in a v years bring all t lie Indians upon " aerations, where they will live in l. niscs. have school houses and churches id will bo r i;, suing peaceful and self- staining vocations, and where they tj ay be visited by the law-abiding lt bite man with the same impunity that i now visits the civilized white settle- a ents. I call your special attentin to w e report of tbe Commissioner of In- b an Affairs for full information on this a bject. it During the last fiscal year 8.095,413 H res of public land were disposed of. ai "this quautity 3,698,910 acres were ken under the homestead law. and c'j .59,595 acres sold for cash. The re- el tinder was located with military war- jjj nU, college or Indiau scrip, or applied satisfaction of grants to railways, oi lier public uses. The entries under ; homestead law during the past year rered 961,545 acres more than those ring the preceding year. Surveys ve been vigorously prosecuted to the 1 extent of the means applicable to : purpose. The quantity of land in tlj ; market will amply supply the pre- u it demand. The claim ofthe settler w der the homstcad or pre-emption m irs is not. however, limited to lands De : ject to -'sale at private entry. Any appropriated surveyed public land y. to a limited amount, be acquired t0 iler the former. laws if the party en- m ed to enter under them will comply th th the requirements they present in 01; :ard to the residence and cultivation. W( e actual settler's preference right of chase is cveu broader, and extends ands which were unsurveyed at the 8V ie of his settlement. His right was th merly confined within much narrow- th imits, and at one period of our his- je y was conferred only by special D8 utes. They were enacted from time . ime to legalize what was then re ded as an nnauthori.ed intrusion tu u the national domain. The opinion au t tbe public lands should be regarded coi ;fly as a source of revenue is no trer maintained. The rapid settle it and successful cultivation of them ow justly considered of more im- 1 tancc to our well being than the fund lt; ch the sale of thorn would produce. ' remarkable growth and prosperity be mr new States and territories attest an wisdom of.tho legislation which in- are s the tiller of the soil to secure a nancnt home on terms within the a hot' all the pioneers who will incur P dangers and privations of arontier fre i, and thus aid in laying the founda- abc of new commonwealths, render a our al service to his country, and is enti- ye to its special favor and protection, se laws secure that object and large- 8 romole the general welfare. They hoy dd, therefore, be cherished as.a per- thi; ent feature of onr land system. awi d faith requires us to give full effect f00 ie existing grants. The time honor- y, and beneficent policy of setting t certain sections of public lands a f educational purposes in the new rv es should be continued. When mat le provision shall have been made tha hese objects, I submit as a question cal thy of serious consideration, whether gx residue of our national domain ild not be wholly disposed of under e provisions of the homestead and ove emption laws. In addition to the was np overflowed lands granted to the WOi 36, in which there are situated the ( s taken under the agricultural col- , act and for internal improvement . mprovem'ent purposes, .under the j if September 1861, and the acts sup- n lentary thereto, there had been con- d up to the close of tho last fiscal . by patent of other equiqalent evi- " e of title, to States and corporations or 25,713 acres for railways, canals wagon.roads. It it estimated that dditional quantity of 174.735,523 i is still due under the grants for ang uses. fer, e policy of thus aiding the States a fe lildiiig works of internal improve- Ujm ; was inaugurated more than forty i since in the grants to Indiana and is. Those States arc opening ca- 0 01 toconnect the waters of the Waba-h we i those ot Lake Erie, and. the waters Non 5 Illinois with those of Lake Miehi- the It was followed with some modi- peri( on in the grant of Illinois of alter- b j sectious of public lands within ccr imits of the Illinois Central Bail- wo 1 Fourteen States and sundry cor- upoi ions have received similar subsi- the i in connection with railways com- as ht :1, or in process of construction. As jOW "served sections arc rated at the n le minimum, the sale of them at the iced price has thus in many instan- PeI iidcmuified the Treasury for the It ed lands. The construction of tion of these thoroughfares has un- ifct edly given a vigorous impetus to t u !velopmcutof our resources and ttleiuent of tho more distant por- ihor ol the country. It may, however, hvo i e, as insisted, that much of our le- youu gisjation in this regard has been charac terized by indiscriminate and profuse liberality. The United States .-hould uot loan their credit in aid ol any enter prise undertaken by States or corpora tions uuless the projected works arc o: acknowledged national importance. I am strongly inclined to the opinion that it is inexpedient and 1 1 nnj lo be stow subsidies of cither dcn-i iption. but should Congress determine otherwise. 1 earnestly recommend that the rights o! settlers and of the public be more effec tually secured by appropriate legislation. During the year ending .September 20. 1870, there were filed in the Patent office 19,411 applications lor patents, 3,374 ca veats, and 160 appli. aiioss for the exteo- j sion of patents. 13,li22 patents, including;' re-issues autl designs, were issued, llo extended, and l.UO allowed but not is sued by reason of the non-pay meat ol the fiual fees.
