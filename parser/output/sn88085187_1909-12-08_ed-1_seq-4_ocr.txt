X's Taft's Message "President Taft's message was received with evi dent approval in the financial district. Wall street feels reassured and stocks went up yesterday. The brief reference to corporations in the message is taken to indicate a conservative course in the treat ment of these matters." Such is the burden of the message that flashed out of Wall street last night after the dabblers in frenzied finance had read the president's message. There was no cry of alarm; no venting of wrath; no wail about "destroying confidence;" no gnashing of teeth over the "attack of the president on the pros perity of the country" such as used to follow the messages of Roosevelt. Wall street seems utterly at ease. The plethoric stock jobbers who live off the sweat of honest in dustry by their own peculiar methods of gambling with the necessities of the people, are complacent and satisfied. In his first message to congress Taft has secured the 0. K. of Wall street. If it suits Wall street how about the toiling masses who are being victimized by the financial sharks that there abound. Candidates Must Stand Test Would you trust him to run your own business? That will be the test for honesty and ability the chamber of commerce will apply to candidates for office next spring. The chamber contemplates taking a hand in the election of the first officials under the commission plan. The 400 members yesterday were sent letters asking for suggestions for candidates. Other civic organizations also are contemplating taking action on the matter of candidates. By the time candidates are ready for the contest it is expected the people will be pretty thorough ly aroused over the matter. Not only will the honesty and ability of candidates be scrutinized, but they will have to tell ' where they stand on various propositions. Candidates will have to tell whether they are for or against the gravity water system; whether they are for municipal owner ship of public service utilities; whether they believe in letting the railroads run the city, or in having the city protect the people from the encroachments of the railroads; whether they want to return to the "wide open" town policy for saloons and dives or whether they stand for still further curbing the lawless ele ments; whether they are for the people or for the special . In terests. The contest In Tacoma next spring, freed from politics, is going to largely assume some of the same characteristics of the big battle in national politics now, as represented by the insur gent and stand-pat elements. Vested Interests and corporations are already casting about to get popular men of ability who lean to the corporation side of things. The progressive elements in the city will probably also line up for men who believe in advancement, and who take the stand that in public affairs the people can act for themselves without waiting to pay tribute to some corporation that desires to exploit the musses.

Fads, Fashions and Home JtitnT*® for Women CYNTIIIA -GREYSj CORESPOHDEHIS Dear Miss Greyi I've been going with the brother of my chum. Igo to their house to see him and his sister, as the lo cality of my htme is not very in viting, and I don't like to ask him there. My father says I am run ning after him. What shall I do? EVELYN. A.! Tell your trouble to your chum. If she is a real friend she will talk to her brother. If he is simply going with you for fun, and so keeping other young men away, he is doing you an Injustice. Never mind what your father says. When a girl sees the right man, she is expected not only to choose him, but to get him and keep him. If the young man lets the qual ity of your home or the neighbor hood where you live influence him, then he's not the man who will "cleave to you in sickness and in health until death you part." You can find out by inviting him to your homo. Dear Miss Grey: What do the letters G. O. P. stand for? Are the letters H. S. P. F. used on invitations. What do they mean? X. A. P. S. A.: (I)— Grand Old Party. (2) —R. S. V. P. are the letters used on invitations, and they stand for "respondoz s'il voul plait," which means in English, "answer if you please." Dear Miss Grey: Please suggest a suitable, Inex pensive Christmas gift for a wom an friend who does not care for books. I must buy something as I do not make fancy work. x. y. z. A.: A dainty jabot, a calendar, a handsome handkerchief, a small piece of silver or imitation Ivory for hot dresser, any of which would answer your purpose.

He was conscious all the while of the whole quarter which he had in his coat pocket as he climbed on the street car. He had earned this quarter sweeping snow off the front sidewalk for father, and his mother had given hi mtwo car tickets and allowed him to jour ney downtown all by himself to spend that quarter. Every now and then while he was on his way he slipped his hand down in his pocket to se if his wealth was still there. All the afternoon he wandered about looking at windows with their array of Christmas toys, and strolled down aisles lined with dolls, engines, wagons and won derful tracks with freight and pas senger trains. There were so many things he wanted, and his 25 cents wouldn't go round. , At last in front of the r. and 10 cent store he paused, and had fully decided on buying a tin engine in the window when he spied a small boy crying beside him. He soon learned that Santa Claus always forgot to come to his home, and that he did want that pretty toy engine so badly. Bobby thought a minute, then set his little chin resolutely. "Come in the store with me," he said, "and you can help me spend my quarter. Maybe we can get that engine." j It was a happy Bobby who sat at the supper table that night. In Actor Honry Miller calls the new theater a gilded Incubator. Yet it turns out no broilers. Now, does it, Hen? They've brought over old Rameses, who ruled Egypt 3,000 years ago, to New York.

A gentleman traveling one summer's day passed where a barefoot boy with cheek of tan was busily resting from raking the meadow sweet with hay. Reining up, the gentleman asked him why he idled so diligently. "If you please, sir," said the boy, "all work and no play is Us own reward. Hence, a burnt child gathers no moss." "Heighho!" exclaimed the gentleman. "You seem to have your copybook very well committed. Pray, what is your name?" "Mike Muller, sir; thank you kindly." "Not a brother of Maud?" pursued the gentleman. "Ay, indeed, sir," said Mike with a smile. "She lives hard by In the great house, and I in yon lowly cot." "Are you not contented?" asked the gentleman. "Oh, yes, sir," said the lad. "For when one is happy one need not be well off, or even rich. All is not half a loaf that glitters." "But, surely, my fine lad, you envy those you behold possessed of wealth and ease?" "Be that as it may sir," said Mike, with a low, lisping, crystal line laugh, "and though a cat may look at people who live in glass houses, a gift horse should not throw stones." "Does this mean," said the gentlemtn, "that you prefer to thrive by the sweat of your own brow?" "Why, no, sir," confessed Mike. "I am already thriving by the sweat of Maud's husband's brow, for which I am very much obliged i to her. A friend In need Is worth two In the bush." ; "I think I understand." said the gentleman. "You have a sine- i cure, or soft snap as It Is called. Your sister married the judge, after i all." "Alas, no," corrected the lad. "The judge lies under the willow In the churchyard yonder. He died and left all his wealth to his i son. You see, a penny caved Is soon parted." "But what then, noble youth, became of Maud?" | "Ah, sir," murmured Mike, "It ia an 111 wind that butters no < parsnips. She married the judge's son." I "How true," sighed the gentleman, clucking to hte horse. "And I how true also that procrastination Improves each shining hour." i CQDJL^DK 1 [ For a Mexican omelet, cook one green and one red pepper minced very fine in a couple of table spoonfuls of butter without browning and until they are ten der. Then turn in one big or two small ripe tomatoes which have been peeled, had the seeds squeezed out and been cut into pieces" and cook for three minutes. Have ready, two oyster | plant roots that have been cooked and sliced thin. Make a cupful of white sauce, turn the oyster plant into it and keep it hot. Make a plain omelet,- whipping the eggs just, enough to break the whites and yolks and give them a very little lightness. When it Is cook ed turn a couple of tablespoonfuls of the tomato and pepper sauce over it. Fold It, remove It to a hot platter and turn over it the salsify sauce. At the ends,, use the rest of the tomato and pep per sauce. Mock . Duck.—Take a large marrow or white squash, whole, unskinned. - Put It in boiling wa ter, cook half an hour; when cool, ski a it. If a marrow, cut off thre inches of the end; if a white squash, knife out a circle about three inches of the end; If a white the stalk. In either case, scoop out all the seeds and fiber. Make a dressing by mixing a pint of grated bread crumbs, three on ions chopped fine, a tablespoon ful of dried sage leaves rubbed fine, a teaspoonful of dried mus tard, two ounces of butter cut in to small pieces, half a teaspoonful of salt; moisten with a beaten egg. Replace the small piece you cut out, put it in a dripping-pan, and bake for two hours, using bacon or salt pork dripping to baste with. The brown gravy to go over will come from a sliced onion, fried golden brown In butter. Add a tablespoonful of flour (brown ed) salt and pepper to taste, pour In boiling water until you have a sufficient quantity, stir ring all the time. Place the duck on a hot dish, strain the gravy over it. Serve with apple sauce, mashed pota toes, mashed turnips, and—some body write me how it tastes. ■ If a sufficient number of Ta coma music lovers display an in terest in hearing Dr. Ludwlg Wullner, the famous I.cider sing er, he will be "brought here by Mrs. Bernlce IE.

SECOND "SUNDAY" HTOHY By Frank H. Williams. "I underElaud, Mr. Lansing," said the plain, sharp-faced woman who had introduced herself as Miss Bolding of The Sunday Star, "that although you are 4 5 years of age, you have never kissed or been kissed by any woman out side of your own immediate fam ily." "That's right." declared Lans iu_r. a hard, rather tall, healthy man. "I've been too busy look ing after the affairs of a big lm-.iin.-.s to engage in any fool ishness like that." "A-hem," murmured Miss Bolding, judicially. "You are, perhaps, aware, Mr. Lansing, that your case is extremely re markable. I don't mind telling you that the Sunday Star intends to run a big, page feature story about you, which they have as signed to me to write." For a moment the man looked at her from beneath his sparse eyebrows. "Well," he declared slowly, at last, "If the newspapers are set on doing it, there's nothing on earth can stop them. Besides," he added, after a further pause, "I don't give a rap, and it's good advertising for the business." The story duly appeared, illus trated with many pictures—Mr. Lansing at his present unkissed age; in knee trousers, unkissed by pretty girls; as a young man, entirely immune to the blandish ments of maidenly smacks. The story made a big hit and caused considerable talk. Following the appearance of the story Mr. Lansing one day telephoned to Mis* Bolding. The latter entered his private office with some trepidation. To her intense surprise she found him garbed with a style he had never before evinced . His face was wreathed in smiles and he was actually affable. "Miss Bolding," he cleared his throat, after seating her, "I have come to the conclusion that I am son:thing of a fool. I should have been kissed some 30 years ago. I have decided to remedy all that. Your Sunday story has shown me where I have missed the greatest good thing of life. I have decided to get married!" At this rather astounding state ment Miss Holding's heart beat wildly. What a wonderful second Sunday story! The reformation of the unkissed man! His plunge into matrimony.
