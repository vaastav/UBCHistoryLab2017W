"It was in the nature of extortion." said Mr Eldredge. "Hut we had to consider th? expense and the interests of the policy holders. We chose the lesser of the two evils." "Were the charges in effect that Presi dent Hurnham had been guilty of misman agement and should be removed?" asked Mr. Hughes "There was a thre it of a receiver," said Mr Elc.redge. "Against your management also?" "I presume so." Mr. Eldredge said he charges especially were dire ted a gait s President Burn ham on account of the large advances to Ful ton B. Morse, tin- m uriger of agents, Mr. Eldredge said th Mutual Reserve paid |15,?00 to McDonald to settle the agitation. THE

'.Ciiv - . ?. ? - ; ker cannon taking the oath (Copyright. 190.";, tvr Frnnrfs B. Johnston.) BUSY WITH MYSTERIES three VIOLENT DEATHS OCCUPY NEW york POLICE. NEW YORK, December 5.?Three of New 1 ork s great highways, the river, the under ground railway and the street and that dark section known as "Chinatown," each fur nished a police mystery today. In two cases, the subway and Chinatown, death had come between the victims and the investigators. In the first the police have only the mangled bod> of a man who, before he hurled him self before a rapidly moving train, had taken every precaution to thwart the efforts of the officers to establish his identity. His clothing, unmistakably now, bore 'not a siiigie distinguishing mark, and not even a trinket was found in any of the pockets. The man was about forty years of age, weighing 170 pounds, was five feet nine inches in height, had dark hair and blue eyes, and the scrupulous care with which he was dressed indicated that he was not a laborer, fic yond those meager details, how e\er, nothing is known. The man jumped directly in front of a train as it swung into the street and Broadway station of the subway. His body was literally ground to pieces. The Chinatown mystery was the death of a woman, Bottle Bane, a white woman whose husband, a Chinaman, died a 'short time ago. Since then she has been living in Pell street, in the house of Mock Duck one of the most notorious of the Chinese rett'It u, York' who now tinder ar ilfttiA tj Ki ', ?" a cha!'ge of murder. Bottle Bane had three callers last night a t hlnaman and a whit* man and a white woman. ?mie During the night these callers summoned a physician and notified the police U at their hostess had faints while she was en her deaT I T"'' |T''e phjslclan- v-'hn found & investigation8 arre8t "nd b^a" an Central Figure in Mystery. The central figure In the mystery of the river is William Hallinger, aged twenty eight years, a market man, who says his home is In Yonkers. He was dragged from the East river near the upper end of Hell Gate early this morning, more dead than alive, by a tugboat captain who heard his cries for help. Hallinger said he came down from Yonkers yesterday with a load of produce, and after disposing of his ware* started out to enjoy himself. He told the las CnlKhfUnriirh^emberd llttIe W last night until he was found struggling in the water.

The California delegation In the Senate and House held a meeting today and agreed on a bill for the exclusion from the United States of Japanese and Koreans. The bill will be introduced in the House by Repre sentative McKlnley, a newly-elected mem ber, who for the past four years was as slstant United States district attorney ln San Francisco, charged with the special duty of enforcing the Chinese exclusion act. It is stated by the members of the dele gallon that there are 00,000 Japanese in California and nearly 100,000 in the United States. In the last year over 8,000 Jan anese came to this country from the Ha waiian islands Members of the delegation say the rapid influx of Japanese is regarded as a menace to American labor. The conditions which inspire this bill are said to be the same aB those which brought about the Chinese exclusion act twenty-two years ago. The bill will extend all of the laws now In force In the United 8tates and its territories excluding Chinese laborers to the Japanese and Koreans. NEW PUBLIC BUILDINGS. Speaker Oannon Indicates Opposition to an Omnibus Bill. Speaker Cannon hit the unborn omnibus public buildings bill between the eyes this morning and put it out of business. Most of his callers of the past few days have spoken of the necessity for such legislation, and Mr. Cannon thought it was about time to open his mouth. 8o, while in conversation with a southern member the Speaker em phatically declared that the way to practice economy at this session?which he considers absolutely neoeesary If revenue-raising legislation is not to be considered?Is cer tainly not to begin discussing a large pork distributing measure. There Is considerable disappointment in oonsequenee. as after the public building bill of last rear was put to sleep it was thought that it would be re 11 m*3r a few OF OFFICE. WILL FORM A CABINET SIR HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNER MAN ACCEPTED TASK. LONDON, December 5.?Sir Henry Carapbdl-Bannerman saw the king at Buckingham Palace this morning-and ac cepted the task of forming a new cabi net. The Duke of Devonshire, liberal union ist. former lord president of the council, was among the callers on the new pre mier before the latter went To the pal ace, and In political circles importance is attached to the visit as possibly signify ing some kind of a working agreement on certain points of policy between the anti-protectionist unionists, of which the duke has been the recognized leader since his secession from the Balfour cab inet, and the new government. 

MONEY FOR THE CANAL. Appropriation Likely to Be Made With out Being Referred. The emergency appropriation for the Panama canal will be made by the House before the committees of that body have been appointed, according to the present Inclination of Speaker Cannon. The ur gency for !the appropriation makes it nec essary that immediate action be taken. Representative Hepburn of Iowa, at the close of the reading of the President's mes sage today, will ask the unanimous consent of tFic House for tiie consideration of the bill tomorrow. This program has been agreed upon by republican leaders. Aside from the necessity of prompt action in supplying funds fcr the canal work, there is a line question of committee juris diction involved in handling the bill. One part of the measure comei under the head of "general legislation," being a provision for making the canal bonds salable. The other feature of the bill is purely an appro priation. The latter portion comes stiictly within the Jurisdiction of the committee on appropriations, while the former is one over which the committee on interstate and foreign commerce rightfully could cia.'m au thority. By putting the bill through the House without committee action, Spc-aker Cannon will avoid the necessity of mak ing a committee reference, which would most likely cause a protest from e ther one or other of the two committees.

E2LKINS CONFIDENT. Looks for a Railway Bate Bill In a Reasonable Time. The Senate committee on Interstate com merce met today, and resumed considera tion of the Interstate commerce commis sion's bill for the regulation of railroad rates, which was sent to the committee during Its sessions prior to the assembling of Congress. The discussions today were confined almost exclusively to the first amendment proposed to the commission's bill, touching upon the relation of railroad rates and rates for water hauls. The com mittee n-at having received reports from H. T. Newcomb, statistician for the rail roads. and Prof. H. T. Adams, statistician for the interstate commerce commission, the meeting was adjourned without result. The reports of the statisticians are ex pected to be ready in time for the commit tee to have a meeting Friday next. There were many conferences at the Sen ate end of the Capitol among senators as to the nature of tills that could be agreed upon, not only In the committee, but In the Senate as well. Senator Elkins again ex pressed his confidence that the committee would agree upon a bill within a reasonable Meeting of the Board o Regents Today. NO DEFINITE ACTION PORTIONS OF PROPOSED DONA TION TO BE EXHIBITED. No Question of Declining the Gift Has Been Raised?Other Business Transacted. It was decided at the meeting of the Smithsonian regents today that the valuable Freer art collection shall, in part, be brought to Washington this winter and plaoed on exhibition temporarily in the Smithsonian building, ptnding the nliimate decision of Mr Freer ;lihI the regents as to its disposition and the building which is to b*> erected In Washington for its reception. This was the most important business be fore the regents today and one in which the art lovers of Washington have been greatly interested. Mr. Charles L,. Freer was one of the art executors of the late James McXelll Whist ler, and the collection which he intends to bequeath to the keeping of the Smithsonian Is valued at about $t!0'),(Xv). It consists of nearly six hundred of the famous artists" etchings, ir, > lithog.-1 .,h- 4~ work in oil. Including some of his most celebrated pictures: :i" of his water -olori 22 pastels and 5 drawings. Beside the pic tures there is a collection of bronzes and oriental art objccls that is said :0 he the finest in the country outside the Bos or Museum of Fine Arts, and there are a num ber of pictures, not by Whlstli- but by other American artists of note. The offer that has been made by Mr. Freer is considered very generous and ir addition to the collection itself he is will ing to spend $500,000 more on a burims in which to house it. There has been some talk since the offer was first made that th" oft'er might be declined by the Smithsonian on the grounds of cost of upae-p and other reasons, also that Mr. Freer was .leased with the attitude that ha<l been assumed toward his gift and that the offer might by withdrawn. No Question of Declining the Gift. It was said at the Smithsonian today that there lias been no question of declining tlio gift, and none so far as the officials know of the withdrawal of the offer. It Is a large question, and it Is stated that it is to be handled slowly and Judiciously. The Smithsonian appreciates the courtesv that has been d^ne it in the offer and lias no I "wish to slight or offend its prospective j benefactor. It was pointed out, however, that the offer Is not of a donation at ail. but it is a proposal to make a bequest to the Institution, which is a rather different matter. Mr. Freer intends to draw his will in a certain way if the Smithsonian is will ing to assume the responsiijilitv for carry ing out the provisions. One of the revis ions is that the collection shall be kept in tact and nothing added to or taken from it after the death of the testator. Official Action. The oUcial statement of the regents action was made as follows: The board took up the consideration of the- proposed bequest of Mr. Charles L. Freer of his art collection to the institu tion, consideration of which hadxbeen con tinued from the last meeting. "In view of the fact that Mr. Freer had expressed his willingness to bring such portions of his collection as might fairly represent the whole to Washington dur'ne the present session of Congress, it was re solved that the secretary bo requested to provide a suitable place in the buildin?- of the Smithsonian Institution or the United States National Museum for the exhibit of such collections as Mr. Freer may desire to bring to Washington, and that he coni ~ej"" Freer to ascertain what time would be most convenient for the-ex hibit of a representative selection as agreed upon between Mr. Freer and the committee of the board of regents "The secretary was also requested' to ex press to Mr. Freer the h:gh appreciation of the generosity exhibited by him." Other Business Transacted. J he meeting, aside from the discussion of the proposed Freer bequest, did not deal particularly with matters of outside Inter est. Those present were: The chanceiior, Chief Justice of the United States Melville W. Fuller, presiding; R. R. Hitt, Robert Adams, Jr.,^ Hugh A. IMnsmore, L>r. An drew D.
