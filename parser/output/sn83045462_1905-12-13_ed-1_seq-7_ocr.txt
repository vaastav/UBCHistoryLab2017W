NOT SUCH ft RADICAL Gov, Cummins' Attitude on Tariff Revision. STICKS TO PROTECTION PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AND HE NOT FAR APART. Declares That the Only Difference of Opinion is as to the Time Changes Should Be Made. Gov. A. B. Cummins of Iowa, who ar rived In Washington Monday nlglit. left last night for Now York, and today went to Rochester to make h speech on tariff re vision. Witliln a few minutes after the arrival or Gov. Cummins he was surrounded by his friends. both personal and political. Throughout the day his rcoms at the Arl ington have been th# scene of numerous conferences. The governor was apparently a busy man. but he found time to talk for a while with a reporter foj The Star, who called on him before he started for the train. "My visit to Washington at this time Is without the slightest political significance.'' said the governor, in response to a query as to his being here. "I came to Washing ton on a matter in which the state of Iowa Is Interested, and my stay here will be short.'* When asked whether he intended to ig nore entirely the question of tariff revision, he responded quickly: "By no means, that is a matter I always have before me, and one for which I never Gov. A. D. Cummings. lose an opportunity to do a little missionary work. Of course my views along this line are pretty generally known, and I know of' nothing new I can say to you on the sub ject." Not at Variance With President. Far from being at variance with the President on the question. Gov. Cummins declared that they are together. Regarding the recent mersage to Congress, Gov. Cum mins said: "President Roosevelt may not have gone at length into the tariff situa tion. but what he did say met with my hearty approval. lie said that he was of the opinion that tariff tinkering might re sult in much harm if it was gone at In a slipshod way. I agree with that. He said that he believed that the tariff should be revised when there appears a necessity and general demand for it. I agree with that most heartily. He did not say thit he thinks the time is ripe for tariff revision by this Congress, and although I do not by any manner of means agree with that it does not in the least put me in opposition to'President Roosevelt. On the contrary I can quite understand that he must have his reasons, and doubtless very good ones, for not pushing the subject at th.s time." "Then you think the President, when the time, in his opinion, Is ripe, will send a special message to Congress on the sub ject?" "I do not say that," quickly responded the governor. "What I mean to convey is that when the President feels that he de sires to push the tariff question squarely to the front he will surely do so in a manner that best pleases him. I desire to assure you that I am perfectly satisfied with the stand of the President as indicated In hu> message. The Only Difference. "The only difference in our views 6s shown is that he does not go as far as t do. I am of the opinion that the time Is ripe for tariff revision, and I believe the whole country will wake up to It within a comparatively short time. When the peo ple come to this point of view Congress will pass the necessary legislation." When asked if he thought that the tariff question would come up at the present ses sion of Congress the governor responded that he hardly thought there would be time after the legislation concerning the Isth mian canal and the railway rate questions are disposed of. Not Such a Radical. "However." said the governor, "such tar iff revision as I favor would not take any great amount of time. 1 am by no means a radical tariff reformer such as are round in the ranks of our good friends the demo crats. Far be It from me to tear the pres ent tariff schedules to shreds. But there are some schedules that need to be chang ed for the benefit of the people at large, and, understand me, I would not change them to the extent of losing the protection they guarantee to home-mmufacturea products. But sufficient of the duty should be removed to make quite a difference to the consumer in the amount he would have to pay for his goods." Gov. Cummins told the reporter that he was In favor of railroad rate legislation and that he was of the opinion that the Panama canal should be constructed In the manner that is found to be the best. "The American people have started that canal work and they want to see It completed," was the concluding commentary of the gov ernor on the canal situation. Meade Post, G. A. R., Elects Officers.
