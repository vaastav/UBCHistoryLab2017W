Bisbee disproved that time-worn statement that a po phet is without' honor in his own country when she honored Sheriff Wheeler Wednesday night. General Von Lndendorff of the German staff is quoted as declaring that "the war will not end in a draw." He must have had advance information upon President Wil son's message-, read Tuesday in congress. - Ney asked Napoleon for infantry at a critical period of the battle of Waterloo. "Infantry," replied the greatest captain of all wars, "do-s the man suppose I can make infantry? But the Germans seem to be able to make in fantry. In the face of three years of the most stupendous losses they are able to hold their long front secure and then mass troops and guns at Cambrai in overwhelming numbers. Either General Byng will have to hitch up his trousers and. tighten his belt and spit on his hands and cut loose with all his steam, or the intense Bisbee rooter for the allied cause will -spend an unhappy Christmas. After sfx carloads of perfectely good potatoes had stood for a week on a sidetrack in Cleveland the city seized them and sold them at ninety-five cents per bushel. How much grain and vegetables and fruit have been at- j lowed to rot jn warehouses and ships and cars during the past two years of high prices, only the Lord knows. Those individuals and companies that buy food in such vast quantities that they cannot properly handle and dis pose of it while it is still in good condition, ought to be sent to jail without bond and then tried before a jury of wage earners who are paying triple prices for the necessities of life. The Halifax disaster emphasizes the constant nienacf of transportation during the war. Ships and tars loaded to capacity with high explosives are moving in a ftream day and night under hurry np orders. That there are not more accidents of thrs.kind is the wonder of it all. Trans portation of troops and explosives to and from all parts of the world during the past three years, with the U-boats doing their worst, has been attended with remarkably small loss of life and property when the hazard is con sidered. All docks and harbors are crowded and all en trances are mined. These times are about as perilous as those seen in the vision of John at Patmos, when the angel opened the seven vials of wrath upon the world. Reports from the Cambrai sector continue to get worse and worse. The London offioe practically admits that it cannot hold the Germans back. This is the most disconcerting news of the war. If the British war ma chine that was good enouih to smash the Hindenburg line . and hold all gains through two summers, has now gone to smash, then the worst is yet to come. The allies have a vast superiorty of men and guns on the western front or did have them. Why they cannot hold the ground won and foi-e the fighting in the open to advantage by a much greater concentration at this point than the Huns is past the comprehension of tliif amateur war critic to fathom. Not for two years have the Germans showed uch hitting power as they have in the past few weeks in Italy and at Cambrai. The oft spoken of German morale seems to have gotten its second wind. Any Bisbee citizen who is inrlined to kick upon the pri'e of twenty dollars a ton for coal, might read the fol lowing from the Washington, D. ('., Times, and then wonder if this district is getting very much the worst of it after all: "It took more than twenty dollars and a pleading voice to buy a ton of coal in Wa&liington yester day. This was proven by a deputation of Times reporters, caeli armed with a twenty-dollar gold piece and an im pending chill and each instructed to use every kind of a plea he could think of to get one tou of coal delivered at his home. One hundred and one coal dealers were isited and as a last resort every government official having anything to do with the fuel question was appealed to. The result bummed up is I hat there were several oc.iers who said that possibly Uiey might deliver a tots some time not week, but would make no promises: from all the rest the answer was, "Sorry, but can't bell you a ton today." " 

HERTLING'S CHALLENGE. (Kansas City Star.) There Is a challenge to the allies as well as to the German people in Chancellor Von Hertling's review of the war. He points to the Cerman military successes and virtually admonishes the central powers to hold on un til the war map can be converted into the peace map. A comparison of German and allied resources shows that a time must come wnen Germany's strength will be waning while that of the allies will still be climbing. There are indications that that time Is neat, if not al ready arrived. If in three years of effort, in which her maximum strength has been used, Germany has not been able to cash in, what chance will she have to do it when her strength begins to decline? Under these cireimstnnces, if Germany had the nerve to hold out while the allies' nerve failed, and they were ready to accept a Lansdowne peace, then Germany would deserve to win and impose her rule on the rest of the world. The wheatless day has been changed from Friday to Tuesday all over the country, and the wheatless day comes on Wednesday now. The change was made in Bisbee this week, and Henry Poppen, manager of the Copper Queen hotel, reports that there were less protests and complaints than at any time since the regulation has been in effecL The average American is a good sport.

JAMES DOUGLAS WRITES ABOUT CONDITIONS IN REGARD TO HIS WORK DUAL MONARCHY IS READY FOR HONORABLE PEACE; RULER SAYS S. P. Applewhite of Douglas has re ceived a letter from James S. Douglas, who is now in France, engaged in Red Cross work and other war activities, which gives an idea of the pi'jblems with which Mr. Douglas is confronted. Following are some excerpts from the letter: "We get very lit.Ie news here. I have visited Rouen with my brother-in-law, who is a colonel in the British army and had a very interesting trip. I have also met and spent some time with a colonel in a Candian contin gent and have seen something of our American officers, notably Col. Coi lins, who was on Gen. Pershing's staff in Mexico.

A dispatch received here from Vienna quotes Emperor Charles of Austria-Hungary as saying in an address to an AusTo German delegation thnt the dual mon archy is ready at any time to con clude peace that would guarantee the integrity of the monarchy. He added. I however, that his country would no' cease fighting until its enemies re nounced their intentions of dismem bering it. "The glorious successes of our armies and fleet." said Emperor Charles, "fill us with patriotic pride. After a glorious defense of our posi tions we are now, as before, ready at any time to conclude an honorable peace which guarantees the existence and integrity of the monarchy.

Cohan, the pride of Broadway, r eived $161 a" word, or $138 a note, as one may prefer, for his popu lar war song, "Over There." The highest previous price ever paid per word for reading matter was two dollars to Theodore Roosevelt Kipling received one dollar a word for a few of his great storfes after he had achieved fame, and Conan Doyle received fifty cents a word for one of his "Brigadier Gerard" stories. But the $25,000 paid to Cohan for this song makes Roosevelt, Kipling et al. look like almanac makers or publicity agents fcr a Chinese laun dry. Strange indeed are the ways of literature, and strange are the rich anJ famous bed fellows the high brews of the craft find there. ' And speaking of Cohan's twenty-five thousand for tbe "Over There" jingle, have you forgotten that Edgar Allen Poe received lust tweuly five dollars for the immortal classic, "The Raven." and that Dr. English did not receive a cent for the poem, Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt," bat wrote it for a publisher friend gratis 7 The power of the press was never more strongly em phasized tand illustrated and made true than in the case of tbe Bowie Enterprise and the the Enterprise is just a small country weekly but in its opposition to the bond issue it was as earnest as a buzz saw and as eloquent as Billy Sunday In a sin cursed town. It was also misguid ed in its crusade, but that has nothing to do with this particular narrative of events. The point is that the En terprise editor was "agin" the bonds, and he labored night and day turning editorials into bombs and para graphs into bayonets and headlines linto liquid fire fcr a drive upon the good roads that would make them impas sable forever. As th campaign waxed warmer this Bowie editor whetted his old goosequill pen until it was sharper than the famou? knife of the man after whom his town was named. He set his deadlines in sixty point and strung them across his pages like banners in the breeze of battle. He viewed with alarm and he viewed with scorn and he viewed with Berserk rage. He argued, pleaded, cajoled, threatened, exposed and exclaimed. He fought to the last ditch against the bonds, and kept on fighting. The bonds carried, it is true, and by an over whelming majority. But in Bowie, the home of this edi tor man, every single vote- was cast in a solid block against the bonds. There were ninety-five votes counted from the Bowie precinct and ninety-five of these were "NO!"
