President Cleveland's Lstt9r to tits Fifty-Fourth Congress. &n Exhaustive Review of Oar Domestic and Foreign Affairs Prompt 8Dd Radical ' Financial Legislation Eecommended Work of tho Departments. WAsniXGTOy, Dec 7. The Fifty Fourth congress assembled for the short session at noon to-day. Soon after committees from the house and senate waited on the president and in formed him that they were ready to receive any communication he miht have to make. The president then , sent to congress the following message: I To the Congress of tne United States: J As representatives of the people In the legis lative branch of their government you have as sembled at a time when the strength and ex cellence of our free institution and the fitness bf our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. Apolitical contest In volving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension and creating ag gressiveness so intense as to approach bitter ness and passion, has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suffrage, without disturbance of our tranquility or tho least sign of weakness in our national structure. When w6 consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful ooedienco and manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opinions we discover abundant evidence of a determl nation on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in tho agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government Thus our peo ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en titles them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which tho acceptance of public duty invites. In obedience to a con stitutional requirement, I herein submit to the congress certain information concerning na tional affairs, with the suggestion of such leg islation as in my judgment is necessary and expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tire some narration, I stu!l omit many details con cerning matters within federal control which, though by no means unimportant, are more profitably discussed in departmental reports I shall also curtail this communication by omitting minute recital of runny minor inci dents connected with our foreign relations which have hitherto found a place in executive messages, but are now contained in a report of the secretary of stale, which is herewith sub milted. The Armenian Question. At the outset of a reference to more Impor tant matters affecting our relations with foreign powers it would afford mo satisfaction if I could assure the congress that tlie disturbed condition of As:atie TurHoy had during the past year assumed a less hideous and bloody aspect and that either as a consequent t the awakening of the Turkish government to the demands of human civili2ttllon, or a3 the re sult of decisive action On the part of the great cations having ths right by treaty to interfere for the protection of those exposed to the rage ot mere bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the fcaocking fea:ures of the situation had been mitigated. Iastead, however, of welcoming a Bofteninj disposition or protective interven tion, we have been afflicted by continued and not unf rcquent reports of thn ranton destruc tion of homes and the bloody butchery of men, women and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith. V.'hile none of our citizens tu Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, though often In the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety in the future Is by no means assured. Our gov ernment at home and our minister at Constan tinople have left nothing undone to protect our missionaries in Ottoman territory, who consti tute nearly all the Individuals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on the Ecore of American citizenship. Several naval vessels are stationed in the Med iterranean as a measure of caution and to fur nish all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency. We have made claims against tho Turkish government for the pilhigo and de struction of missionary property at Harpool and Harash during uprisings at those places. The Insurrection In Cuba. The insurrection in Cuba still continues with all its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made to wards the pacification of the island or that the Situation of affairs as depicted in my 1-st an nual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all considerable towns, the insurgents still roam at will ever at least two-thirds of the in land country. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time and is evidenced by her unhesitating devotion of largoly increased military and naval forces to the task, there is much rea son to believe that the insurgents have gained In point of numbers, and character, and resources, and are none the less inflexible la their resolve not to succumb, without practi cally securing the great project for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither h ive the insur gents yet m:ide good their title to be regarded as an independent state. Indeed, as the con gest has gone on, the pretense that civil gov ernment exists on the island, except so far as Spain is ablj to maintain it, has been practi cally abandoned. Spain does keep oa foot such a government, more or less imperfectly, in the large towns and their immediate suburbs. But, that exception being made, the entire country is either given over to an archy or is subject to the mili tary occupation of one or the other party.' It is reported. Indeed, on reliable au thority that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief of the insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now given up all at tempt to exercise its functions, leaving that government confessedly (what there Is the best reason for supposing it always to have been in fact) a government merely oa paper. Were the Spanish armies abie to meet their antagonists in the open, or in pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be locked for and the Immense superiority cf the Spanish forces in numbers, discipline and equipment, could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage. But they are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that can choose and does choose its own ground, thai from the nature of the country is visible or invisible at pleasure and that fights only from ambuscade and when all the advantages of position and cumbers are on its side. In a country where nil that Is. indispensable to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtain able especially by thosi bom and trod oa the soil it Is obvious that there is hardly a limit to tho time during which hostilities of this tort may be prolonged. Meauwhiie, as in all cases of protracted civil strife, the pas sions of the combatants grow mere aod tacre lufi-iroed and excesses on both "sides rrconie more frequent and more deplorable. They also are participated in by bands of marauders, who tow la the cstce of one party rad cow ls the aaae of the other as may best 'EilS the o-'casjvii. harry -tr.e country at will .a si ji,jj.;.-r i:z n ? rW. iiihaiitants Ut th.oir '..,-- ;,.-'i-s.v. ?'... ii x cadlitoa of hlnss y i ;.t IC'"'. . -v r t ,; S-i'SKsse destructiod rirriiv ovu Sf & ss.-rre tfia JSOllC?

It is reliably asserted that should these In terruptions eontinue during Iho currant year, and practically extend, as It is now threat ened, to the entire sugar producing territory of the island, so much time and so much money will be required to restore the land to Its normal productiveness that It is exirernly doubtful if capital can be Induced M even make the attempt The spectacle of the utter ruin cf an adjoining country, by nature one of the ffioH fertile and charming on the globe would engage the serious attention of the gov ernment and people of the United State3 Under any circumstances, la point o fact, they have a concern with It which is by no means of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardiy separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary Interest in it Is seoond only to that of the pecpie and government of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least from 

30,OGO,W to f 0,0 0,003 ot American Cap ital are Invested In plantations and in railroad, mining and other business enterprises on the island. The volume of trade between the United State3 and Cuba, which in 1S83 amount ed to about Jot.OOO.OOt), rose in 1S03 to about 1103,0 0,000, and in 1891, the year before tee in surrectlon broke ct, amounted to nearly 493 007,0 0. Besides this large pecuniary stake la the fortunes of Ctiba, the United States finds itself Inextricably involved la the present con test in other ways, both vexatious and costly. Many Cubans reside in this country and directly promote the insurrection through the press by public meetings, by the purchase and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds and by other means which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do hot permit to be made thd subject of criminal prosecution. Some of them, though Cubans at heart and In all their feelings in interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a View to possible projection by this government and not unnatu rally regarded With much indignation by the country of their origin. These inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion In Cuba, the large American property interests affected end considerations of philanthropy and hu manity in general have led to a vehement de mand in various quarters for some sort of pos itive intervention on the part of t&e United States. It was at 6f?t proposed that belliger ent ttphls should be accorded to the insur gents a proposition no longer urged because Untimely and In practical operation clearly perilous and injurious to our own Interest. It has since been and is now sometimes Contended that the independence bf the Insurgents should be recoguiied. But Imperfect and restrictel as the Spanish government of the island may be. no other exists there, unless the will of the military officer in temporary command of a particular district can be dignified as a species of government. It is now sfisgested that the United States should buy the island, a tu?gestioh possibly worthy of consideration if there were any evidence of a desire or willingness oa the part cf Spain to en tertain such a proposal It is urged, finally, that all other methods falling, the existing in ternecine strife in Cuba should be terminated by our Intervention, even at the co3t of war between the United States and Spain, a war which its advocates confidently prophecy could be ncitherlavge in its proportions nor doubtful in its issue. The correctness of this forecast need be either affirmed nor denied. The United States has nevertheless the character to main tula as a nation, which plainly dictates that right and might should be the rule of Its con duct. It would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home -rule which, whiie preserving ths sovereignty ot Spain would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects, there ihould be no just reason why tho pacification of the island might not be effected oh that basis. It was In timated by this government to the government of Spain some months ago thit If a satisfac tory measure cf home rule were tendered the Cuban insurgents and would be ac cepted by them upon a guaranty cf its cxecbtion the United States would en deavor to find a way not objection able "to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. It should be added that it cannot be reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely main tained. While we are anxious to arcord all due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the pending confiict in all its features, and properly apprehend our Inevita ble relations to It and Its possible results with out considering that by the course of events we may be drawn into such an unusual and unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, . either alone and in her own way. or with our friendly co-operation. When the inability of Spain to deal success fully with the insurrection has become mani fest, and it is demonstrated that her sover eignty is extiact la Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug gle for its re-establishment has degenerated into a strife which means nothing more thin the useless sacrifice of human life and thea utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented la which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. The Venezuelan Boundary Question. The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of difference between Great Britain fcnd the United States, their re spective governments having agreed upon tho substantial provisions of a treaty between Great Britain an 1 Venezuela submitting tho whoie controversy to arbitration. The provi sions of the treaty are so eminently just and fair that tho assent of Venezuela thereto may confidently be anticipated. Government Revenue and Expenses. The secretary of the treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1SS6, the receipts of the government from all sources amounted to fit 9,475,4 8.73. During the same period Its expenditures were &3i.63".6';4.4Sl The excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounted to t S.JJ3.23 ."0. The ordinary ex penditures during the year were H01S52.21 1sj than during the preceding fiscal year. Of the rece'.ot mentioned there were derived from customs the sum of i6O,0-.'l,"j!.6r, and from internal revenue, Ui S30.6l5.66. The re ceipts from customs show an increase of 17, 863,131.; over those from the same source for the fiscal year ended June W, ISJi, and the re ceipts from internal revenue an increase of I3.at.537.01. The value ot our imported dutiable merchan dise during the last fiscal year was 3'9,7.i",!70 and the value of free goods imported 11 9.?e. 470, beinjr an Increase of H5i3,C7i la the value of dutiable goods and tSl.31.04 la the value of free goods over the preceding year.

The report of the" secretary of war exhibits satisfactory conditions ia the several branches of the public service intrusted to his charge. The limit of our artillery force as fixed by law is constantly and readily maintained. The present discipline and morals of the army are excellent and marked progress and efficiency are apparent throughout its entire organiza tion. With the exception of delicate duties In the suppression of slight Indian disturbances along our southwestern boundary In which the Mexican troops co-operated and the compul sory, but peaceful return with the consent of Great Britain of a band of Cree Indians from Montana to the British possessions, no active operation have been required of the army dur ing tb past yBaft The organised militia numbers 112,879 men. The appropriations for Its support by the sev eral states approximate t J,800,0 0 annually and lluO.000 is contributed by the general govern ment Investigation shows these troops to be Unusually well drilled and Inspired with much military interest, and In many instances they' are so deficient In proper arms and equipment that a sudden call to active duty would find them inadequately prepared for field service. 1 therefore recommend that prompt measures be taken to remedy this conditioa and that every encouragement be given to this deserv ing body of unpaid and voluntary citizen sol diers upon whose assistance we must largely reh in time of trouble. During the past yeir rapid prdres has b6a made toward the completion of the scheme adopied for the erection and armament of for tifications along our sea coast, while equal progress has teen made la providing the mate rial for submarine defense ia connection with these works. This improved situation is larpely due to the receat generous response of congress to the recommendations of the war deportment The Attorney-;efi6r'al0 Department. The attornejgeneral presents a detailed and interesting statement of the important Wofk done under his supervision during the last Esc&l year. The ownership and management by the government of penitentiaries for the confinement of the convicted in the United Stales courts of violations of federal laws, which for many years has been a subject of executive recommendation, has at last to a slight extent been realised by the utiliza tlon of the abandoned military prison at Fort Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary. This is certainly a movement in the right di rection: but ic ought to bs at once supple mented by the rebuilding or extensive enlarge ment of this improvised prison and the con struction of at least one more, to be located in the southern states. The capacity of the Leavenworth penitentiary is so limited that the expense of its maintenance, calculated at a per capita rata upon the number of prisoners It can accommodate does not make as econom ical an exhibit as it would If It were larger and better adapted to prison purposes: but I am thoroughly con vinced that economy, humanity and a proper sense of responsibility and duty toward those whom we punish tor violation of federal law dictate that the federal government have the entire control and management of the peniten tiaries where convicted violators are confined. It appears that since the transfer of the Fort Leavenworth military prison to its new uses th work previously done by the prisoners con fined there, and for which expensive machin ery has been provided, his been discontinued. Thi3 work consisted of ths manufacture of articles for army use, now done elsewhere. On all grounds it is exceedingly desirable that the convicts confined In this penitentiary be al lowed to resume work of this description. The. Post Office Department. Our post office department is in good condi tion and the exhibit made of Its operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, lt9d, if allowance Is made for Imperfections In the laws applicable to It. is very satisfactory. The total receipts during the year were .3i.439,308L 40. The total expenditures were 90,6:6,:-9a84, ex clusive ct l,?f.9.S5a 27, which was'earsed by the Pacific railroad for transportation and credit on their debt to the government There was an increase of receipts over the previous year of $.),M8,! 821, or 7.1 per cent, and an Increase of expenditures of $!,83s,ut.O", or 443 per cent. The deficit was il,(7J.9 6.19 less than that of the preceding year. The chief expenditures of the postal service are regulated by law and are not la control of the postmaster-general. All that he can accomplish by the most watch ful administration and economy is to enforce prompt and thorough collection and account ing for public moneys and such minor savings in small expenditures anl In letting those con tracts for post office supplies and star service which are not regulated by statute. The average revenue trom each pound of first-class matter was 93 cents. From each pound of seconl-class, t mills (of the second ciass 52,343. 8? was county free matter). From each pound ot third-cliss, 13.1 cents. From each pound of fourth-class. l& cents. The growth In weight of second-class matter has been from 2Cy.O x,0 0 pounds in 1891 to 312,000, 100 in 139i, and to almost 3i9.O,i)O0 ia l?5a, and it is quite evident this in creasing drawback is far outstripping any possible growth of postal revenues. Our mail service should, of course, be such as to meet the wants and even the conven iences of the people, at a direct charge upon them so light as prhap to exclude the Idea of our post office department being a money making concern, but in the face of constantly recurring deficiencies In its revenue, and In view of the fact that we supply the best mill serv ice in the world, It seems to me it is quite time to correct the abuses that swell enor mously our annual deficit If we concede the public policy of carrying weekly newspapers tree ia the county of publication and even the policy of carrying at le--s than oce-tetnh of their cast other bona fide newspapers and periodicals, there can be no excuse for subjecting the serv ice to the further immense and increasing loss involved la carrying at the nominal rate ot one cent a pound the serial libraries, sometimes including trashy and even harmful literature and other matter, which under the loose Inter pretation of a loose statute has been gradually given second-class rates, thus absorbing ail profitable returns derived from first-class matter, which pays three or four times more than its cost, and producing large annual loss to be piid by general taxation. Experience and observation haTfl demon strated that cerU'a improvements in the or ganisation of the post oce Uen,.rtmeat must te serveA before we can g&ia the full fceneat of the immerse sums expended in its administra tioa.

The naval militia, which was authorized a few years ago, as an experiment, has now de veloped Into a body of enterprising yoUng men, active and energetio la tho discharge of their duties and promising great usefulness. Tiiia establishment ha3 nearly the same relation to our navy as the national guard in the differ ent states bears to our army, and constitutes a source of supply to our naval forces,- the im portance of which is Immediately apparent The Interior Department. The report ot the secretary of the interior presents a comprehensive and interesting ex hibit of the nuinor&us-and Important affairs committed to his supervision It is impossible in this communication to do more than briefly refer to a few of the subjects concerning which the secretary gives full and instructive infor mation. Our public l inds, originally amount ing to 1,813,9JO,0.10 acres have been so reduced that only about C00,rC0,i0J acres still remain in government control, excluding Alaska The balance, being by far the most valuable por tion, has been given away to suttlers, to new states and to railroads, or sold at a compara tively nominal sunt The total Iudiau population of the United States is 177,23). according to a census made in 189s, exclusive of those within the state of New York and those comprising the five civilized tribes. Of this number there are approxi mately 38,000 children of school age. During the year 23,393 of these were enrolled in schools. The progress which has attended re cent efforts to extend Indian school facilities and the anticipatian of continued liberal ap propriations to that end, cannot fail to afford the utmost satisfaction to those who believe that the education ot In dian children is a prime factor in the accomplishment of Indian civilization. The condition of affairs among the five civilized tribes, who occupy large tracts of land In the Indian territory and who haye governments of their own, has assumed such an aspect as to render it almost indispensable that there should be an entire change In tho relations of these Indians to the general government. This seems to be necessary In furtherance ot their own interests as well &s for the protection of non-Indian residents In their territory. A commission organized and empowered under several recent laws Is now negotiating with these Indians for the relinquishment of their courts and the division of their common lands In severalty. The reception of their first proffers of nego tiation was not encouraging, but through pa tience and such conduct on their pirt as dem onstrated that their intentions were friendly and in the interest Of the best prospect of suc cess has become more promising. The efforts should be to save the Indians from the conse quences of their own mistakes and improvi dence and t3 secure to ths real Indian his rights as against intruders and professed friends who profit by his retogresslon. A change Is also needed to protect life and property through the operation of courts con ducted according to strict justico and strong enough to enforce thoir mandates. As a sincere friend cf the Indian I am ex ceedingly anxious that these reforms should be accomplished with the consent and aid of the tribes and that no necessity may be pre sented for radical or drastic legislation. I hope, therefore, that the commission now con ducting negotiations will soon bo able to report that progress has been made toward a friendly adjustment of existing difficulties. It appears that a very valuable deposit of gilsonite or asphaltum has been fouad on the reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncom pahgre Ute Indians. Every consideration of care for the public interest and every sensible business reason dictate such management or disposal of this Important source of publio revenue as will except it from the general rules and incidents attending the ordinary dis position of public lands, and secure to the gov ernment a fair share at least of its advantages in place of its transfer for a nominal sum to Interested individuals. I indorse the recommendation made by the present secretary of the interior, as well as his predecessor, that a permanent commission, consisting of three members, one of whom shall be an army officer, be created to perform the dalles now devolving upon the commis sioner and assistant commissioner of Indian affairs. The management of the bureau In volves such numerous diversities and the advantages of an uninterrupted policy are so apparent that I hope the change suggested will meet the approval of tho congress. The Fenxion KolL The diminution ot our enormous Tension roll and the decrease of pension expenditures which have been so often foretold still fail in material realization. Tho number of pension ers oa the rolls at the close of the fiscal year ended June 3), 1S91, was 970,678. This is the largest number ever reported. The amount paid exclusively for pensions during the year was 1138,214,781.9 1, a slight decrease from that of the pre ceding year, while the total expend itures oa account of pensions. Including the cost ot maintaineace of the department and expenses attending pension distribution amounted to fl4.20S.-i60.59, or within a very small fraction of one-third of the entire ex pense of supporting the government during the same year. The number of new pension certifi cates issued was, &0.6HX Of these 40,371 repre sent original allowances of claims and 15,673 increases of existing pensions. The number of persons receiving pensions from the United States, but residing ia forolga countries at the close of the last fiscal year was 3,781, and the amount paid to them during the year was tS2,73a3S. The sum appropriated for the pay ment of pensions tor the current fiscal year, ending June 30, 1:97. Is 

IIW.O O.OM. and for the succeeding year it Is estimated that the same amount will be necessary. The commiisioner ot pensions reports that during the last fiscal year oii indictments were found against violators ot the pension laws Upon these indictmebts 17 convictions resulted. Ia my opinion, based upon such statements as t'cese and much other informa tion and observation, the abuses which have been allowed to creep into our pension system have done incalculable barm in demoralizing our people and undermining good citizenship. I have endeavored within my sphere of official duty to protect oar pension roll and make it what it should be, a roll of honor, containing the narces of those clisablad ia their country's service and worthy of their country's affection and reraembraace.

The Agrirolttrral Depirtaieot. The department cf agiicultare is so inti mately related to the welfare f our j cople and the prosperity ot our nation that it si'oull coa Etaatiy receive the care and encouragement ol the government The secretary reports that the value of our exports ol farm products dur ing the last fiscal year amounted to 1 70.000,000. aa increase of W.OOO.&.X) Mr those of the year immediately preeodtng This statement Is not the less welcome be cause of the fact that notwithstanding such in crease, the proportion ot exported agricultural products to our total exports of ail description fell off during the yrar. The benefits of an la crease la agricultural products being assured, the decrease in its preporxioa to our total ex ports is more gratifying when we cousidcr that it is coming to the fact that such total experts for the year increased more than J7j .(VO.CcO. The large and increasing exportation of our fljrieuitural products suggests the great rue fulness of the organisation lately established In the department for the purpose of getting to those engaged in the farming puisuits re liable information concerning the condition, needs and advantages of different tureigft markets. Inasmuch &3 its success ot th farmer depends upon the advantageous sale of his products, and Inasmuch as foreign n:ar kets must largely be the destination of sucK products, it is quite apparent that a knowledge of the conditions and wants that afreet these markets ought to result In sowing more Intelligently and reap ing with a better promise of p'r3fi. Such information points out the way to a pru dent foresight in the selection and cultiva tion of crops and to a release from the bond age of unreasoning monotoray ot protection, a glutted and depressed market and constantly recurring unprofitable toil, la my opmioa the gratuitous distribution of seeds by the depart ment as at present conducted ouht ta be discontinuedi CltU Service Reform. The progress made In civil service reform furnishes a cause for the utmost congratula-' tion. It has survived the doubts of Its friends as well as the rancor of its enemies, and Das g'ained a permanent place nmong the agencies' destined to cleanse our politios and Improve, economize and elevate the public service There are now in the competitive classified service upwards of 81,001 places. More than half of these have been included from time to time since March 4, 1S33. A most radical and sweeping extension was made by executive order dated the th day of May, IS95, and If fourth-class postmisterships are not in cluded in the statement It may be said that practically all positions contemplated by the civil service law are now classified, Abundant reasons exist for Including these postmaster ships, based upon economy, itiproved service and the peace and quiet of neighborhoods. If, however, obstacles prevent such action at present, I earnestly hope that congress will, without Increasing post office appropriations, go adjust them as to permit in proper cases of a consolidation of these post offices to the end that through this process the result desired may to a limited extent be accomplished. The civil service rules as amended during the last year provide for a sensible and uni form method of promotion, basing eligibliity to better positions upon demonstrated effi ciency and faithfulness. The absence of fixed rules on this subject has been an infirmity in the system more and more apparent; Its other benefits have been better appreciated. The advantages of civil servioe methods In their business aspects are too well understood to re quire argument Their application has be come a ucessity to the executive work of the government But those who gain through the operation of these methods should be made to understand that the non-partisan s:heme through which they receive their appointments de mands from them, by way of reciprocity non partisan and faithful performance of duties under every administration, and cheerful fidel ity to every chief. While they should be en couraged to decently exercise their rights of citizenship and to support through their suf frage the political belief they honestly pro fess, the nolsv, pestileat and partisan em ploye, who loves political turmoil and conten tion, or who renders lax and grudging service to an admi&lstration not rep resenting his political views, should be promptly and fearlessly , dealt with in such a wav as to furnish a w-irain? to others who may be likewise dispose! The annual report of the commissioners will be duly trans mitted and I conmmoad the important matter they have ia charge to the careful considera tion of congress. The Tariff. I desire to recur to the statements else where made concerning the government re ceipts and expenditures for the purpose of venturing upon some suggestions touching our present tar. ft law and its operations. This statute took effect on the 26th day of August, 189 1. Whatever may be its shortcomings as a complete measure ot tariff reform, it must be conceded that it has opened up the way to a freer and greater , ex change of commodities between us and other countries and thus furnished a wider maritet for our products and manufactures The only entire fiscal year during which this law has been in force ended on the 30 ih day of June, 184 In that year our imports increased over those of the previous year more than H.aoO.OX) while the value of the domestic prod acts exported and which found mar kets abroad was nearly 70,0 O.OuO more than during the preceding year. Those who insist that the cost to our people of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful use should only be Increased through tariff changes to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of the government as well as those who claim that tariff changes may be laid upon such articles beyond the necessities of government revenue, ant! wita the additional purpose of so Increasing their price ia our markets as to give American manufacturers and producers better and more profitable opportunities, must agree that our tariff laws are only primarily justified as sources of revenue to enable the government to meet the necessary exp nses of its maintenance. Con sidered as to lis sufficiency ia this aspect the present law can by no means fall under just condemnation. During the only complete fis cal yearcf its operation it has yieldel nearly 

&OJ0.QOO mors revenue than was received from tariff duties in the preceding year. There was nevertheless a deficit between our receipts and expenditures of a little more than t;vX. ftXX This, however, was not unexpected. The situation was such in December last seven months before the clow of the fiscal year, that the secretary ot the treasury fore told a deficiency of tlT.OOO.OoX The great anl increasing apprehension anl timidity in busi ness circles and the depression ia all activities intervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well understood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or operation, seriously checked the imports we would have otherwise received aad readily account for !he difference between this estimate of the secre tary and the actual deficiency as well as tor a continued deficit I believe our present tariff law, If allowed a lair opportunity, will ia the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical expenditures, will overcome ail d'.firnities. Ia the meantiras no deficit that has occurred or itay oc-ur need excite cr disturb is.

They have been f;iucnt;y pfessed upon the filiation of congress is pre vious executive commGatcaticg aad the ia efi' danger of their froutintitd toleration pointed out Without nw repraiing bse de tails I cannot refrs' from atia earnestly presenting the necessity Cf the prompt reforrf of i system opposed to every rd of scursl finance alid shown by cxyer'euce to be fraujhf with the fruvest itl and perplexity. Ttl terrible civil war skich 4aok the foundations ct cur government more thad !H Tears s brought in its train the destruction of r fryviy, the wasting of country's substances, and the' estrangement of brethera. These are now pais and torgottea Even the iistressing loss ef life the conflict entailed it but a sacred Ktjuorj, which fosters patriotic sentiment and kotps alive a tender regsrd tor those who lionly died, and yet there remains with us to day, in full strength and activity as an hici dent of that tremendous struggle, fi. slurs ot its fiuaucial necessity cot only ensuited to our present circumstances, but manifestly dis turbing menace to business secur.ty and ca rer present agent ?f monetary distress Because we may be enjoying a temporary re lief from its depressing influence thU should hot lull us into a falsd security nor lead us w forget the suddenness ot past tlsitation. I aid more conf hiced than ever that we cannot have assured financial peace and safety until the government obligation ripen Which gold may be demanded from the trfsury are with drawn from circulatioa and collected. This might be done, as has been heretofore recou mended, bj their exchange for long term bonds bearing a low rate of icterjs, r by their re demption with the proceeds of Sue bonds. Even if only the United States cotes knoits n greenbacks were thus retired, it is probabld that the treasury notes issued la payment of silver purchases under the act of July 14, lti. Cow paid In gold when demanded, would not create much disturbance, as they mUht from time to time, when received la the trea sury by redemption iu gold, or otherwise be graduall and prudently replaced by silver coin. This plan cf issuing boads for the purpose of rMeraptiou certainly ap;ears to be the most effective and direct path to the needed reform. Ia default of this, however, it would be a step la the right direction it currency obligations are redeemab'e ia gold whenever so redeemed should be cancelled instead cf being reissued. This operation would be a slow remedy, but il would improve present conditions. National banks should redeem their owa notes. They should be allowed to issue clrcu latum to the par value of bonds deposited a security for its redemption and the tax on their circulation should be reduced to one fourth of one per cent In considering projects for the fct'rement of United States notes and treasury coUs isue4 under the new law ot IS9J I am of the opin.oil we have placed too much stress upon the dan ger of contracting the currency and have cal culated too little upon th6 gold that would be added to our circulatioa If iavlted to us by l et ter and safer financial methods. It is not so much contraction of our ourrea:y that should be avoided as Its unequal distribution. This might be obviated and fear of harmful con traction at the same time removed by allowing the organization of small banks and in loss populous communities than are now permit: ed aud authorizing existing banks to establish branches in small communities under propel restrictions. The entire case may Ce presented by the statement that the day of sensible and sound financial methohs will not dawn upca Us t'lHit our government abandons the banking busi ness and the accumulation of funds, and con fines its monetary operations to the receipts of money contributed by the people for its support, and to the expenditure of such money for the people's benefit Our business inter ests and all good citizens long for rest from feverish agitation and the Inauguration by the government of a reformed financial poii' y which will encourage enterprise and mak certain the rewards of labor and industry. Trusts and Monopolies. Another topio la which our people rightfully take a deep interest may be here brieily con sidered. I refer to the expense of trusts unl other huge aggregations ot capital, the object of which is to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade, Industry, or com merce and to stifle wholesome oompetitiox When these are defended It is usually oa the ground that though they increase profits they also reduce prices and thus may benefit tits publio. It must be remembered, however, thai a reduction of prices to the people Is not one of the real objects of these organizations, nor is their tendency necessarily ia that direction. If it occurs la a particular case 11 is only because it accords with the purposes or interests ot those managing them. Such occasional results fall short of compen sating the paipab'e evils charged to the ac count of trusts and monopolies Their ten dency is to crush out individual lndependenca and to hinder and to prevent the free use of j human faculties and ths full development of human character. Tnrough them the Urmcr, j the artisan and tin small trader is in danger, of dislodgement from the proud position of be ing his owa master, watchful ot all that touches his country's prosperity, In which te has an individual interest la all that affects the advantages of business of which he is a factor, to be relegated to the level ot a mere appurte nance to a great machine, with little free will, with no duty but that of passive obedience and with little hope or opportunity of riainn in ths scale of responsible and helpful citizenship. To the instinctive belief thai such is the Inevi table trend of trusts and monopolies Is due tie wide-spread and deep-seated popular aversion in which they are held and the not unreasona ble Inslstance that whatever may be their in cidental econoxiio advantages, their general effect upon personal character, prospe:ti and usefulness can not be otherwise thsa Injurious. Though congress has attempted to deal w.ih this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thus f jr have proved Ineffective, cot because of any lack of disposition or at tempt to enforce them but simply because the laws themselvei as interpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. It tnc insufficien cies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation it should be done- The fact must be recognized, howevrr, that all federal legislation on this subject Kay fall short cf its purpose because of inher ent obstacles. and alsobecauseof the complex character of our governmental systrm, which, white making the federal authority supreme within its sphere, ha carefully limited that sphere by met-rs and boun-Jj which cannot be transgressed. Thi decision of our highest court en this precise question rerrs It quite doubt ful whether the evils of trusts and monopoiie can be adequately treated throu. h federal ac tion unless they seek directly an l purposely to Include la their objects transportation or in tercourse between states cr between th9 United States and fore'.ga countries It does not follow, however, that this is ti.e limit of the remedy that may be ap-P'-cd-Eves though it may be found that federal au thority is not brcai enough to fully reut'h ths case, there can be no doubt cf the power ot the eereral states to act effectively la the prt-m-ises, anl there should be no reason to doubt their wliiicgness to judiciously exercise suca power.
