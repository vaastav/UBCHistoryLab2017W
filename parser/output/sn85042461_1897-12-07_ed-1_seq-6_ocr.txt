THE MESSAGE DIGESTED The president's message, in full com prising some 13,000 words, is presented elsewhere in this morning's Herald. For those who have not the time nor the Inclination to peruse it in its entirety, the subjoined digest is offered: President McKinley after a few words congratulating the congress upon the general situation and outlook plunges fllrectly into the subject of the currency. He declares that past history and present opportunity show that currency reform Is feasible while immediate legislation is demanded. It is not that our currency of every kind is not good, for every dol lar of it is good—made so by the pledge Of the government. The evil of the present system is found in the great cpst to the government of keeping on a par with gold our different forms of money. We must either curtail the op portunity for speculation or increase the gold reserve for their redemption. There is at present no way to increase the gold reserve except through an in crease of the bonded indebtedness. I earnestly recommend, as somi a.s the receipts of the government are quite Sufllcicnt to pay all the expenses of the government, that when any of the Unite*! States notes are presented for redemption In gold and are redeemed In gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out In exchange for gold. This Is an obvious duty. The president goes "n to say that the Whole strain of gold redemption rests Dn the government alone. This ought to be stopped. He then alludes to the plan of the secretary of tho treasury. He concurs with the recommendation that the national brinks be allowed to issue' notes to the face value of the bonds leposlted for circulation, and that the tax on circulating notes be reduced to one-half of one per centum per annum. The president also recommends that authority be given for the establishment af national banks with a minimum cap ital of $25,000. All national bank notes to be restricted to the denomination of $10 and upward, and that national banks be required to redeem their notes In gold. The Cuban question is next taken up, its history presented at considerable length, and the policy of non-interven tion is declared to have been the policy Df the United States nt all times. The (barge thut filibustering has been tol erated by our government Is denied in positive terms. The president then re- Views the question of according the Cubans belligerent lights. After quot ing General Grant at length against »uch a policy, and explaining what the recognition of belligerency means and the responsibilities It would impose ho says: "I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents ns now unwise and therefore lnadmlsaa ble. Should thut step hereafter be Seemed wise as a measure of right and duty, the executive will take' it." Nor, he says, should we intervene upon humanitarian grounds until the policy and plan of the new Spanish administra tion have been given a fair trial. Hawaiian annexation comes next. Mr. McKinley urges that the treaty be rati fied, but does not attempt to answer any of the objections that have been ad vanced against it. He takes it lor granted that the proposition will be ac cepted. Other foreign relations are dghtly touched upon and the Nicaragua :anal project indorsed. The president after reciting the his- Tory of the international bimetallic com | mission, says the commissioners are still at work with the expectation that the problem of International bimetallism may yet be solved through the co operation of the leading nations. Mr. McKinley expresses the hope that the labors of the commission will prove suc cessful. The executive states that reciprocity negotiations are progressing favorably and urges that our foreign commerce should be extended through the Im provement and enlargement of our mer chant marine. An agreement on Import ant facts connected with pelagic seal ing is reported, international arbitra tion is heartily approved, as is also the Paris exposition, and then the president comes to the matter of coast defenses. The recommendations of the secretary of the navy are approved, including those for more dry docks on both coasts, and another battleship to be built on the Pacific coast. A flexible system of government for Alaska is urged upon the attention of congress, likewise the permanent estab lishment of a military forco in the terri tory and investigation of the reports of probable destitution is recommended. The continuance of the present form of government in the Indian territory is declared to be undesirable and the work of the Indinn commission reviewed. In dividual ownership is made the first cs sentlal sup toward reorganization. The appointment of an expert yellow fever commission is suggested. The Union Pacific railroad sale is re viewed, likewise the status of the Kan sas Pacific. In the case of the latter the president says: "The government, rather than accept less than its claim, should become a bidder and thereby the owner of the property, and I sub mit this to congress for action." No ref erence Is made to the Central Pacific. After discussing the present civil ser vice law Mr. McKinley says that he will not hesitate to exempt cases that he thinks have been improperly included In the classified service or to include those which in his judgment will best promote the service. He will endeavor in uphold and extend the system. The message will hereafter be con sidered more in detail. 

WHERE THE LAUGH COMES IN Our grave and reverend contemporary, the Time?, reads The Herald a curtain lecture because of our undue levity and worlelly-mindodnc-ss in discussing Secre tary Alger and his little advertisement. Nothing could have been further from us than envy of our Republican neigh bors in their enjoyment of this morsel of government patronage. Let us see: At commercial rates, this advertisement, published six times in The Herald, would come to $G and no cents. Docs it seem likely that The Herald would shed edi torial tears over such a trifle? Perish the thought! No. The Herald never expected it and was not disappointed in not getting it; but we- did enjoy an equal advantage with our contemporary in publishing it ahead of time gratis If Statesman Al ger had only given us the tip, we would have gladly paid him $6 for the privilege of making the first exclusive publication. However, to print it on any terms was glory enough for one day. As to Secretary Alger's attitude in the premises, we may or may not have mis judged him. Perhaps he is incapable of taking so small a revenge on Republi can papers that have ventured to criti cise him. Perhaps he does not publish anywhere more detailed specifications than he does here. We can only wait un til the facts develop. Uut If The Herald, together with the community at large, had oversized the magnitude of this advertising proposi tion, Statesman Alger is largely respon sible- for the misconception. It was some time last memth, we believe, when Statesman Alger began to experience grave doubts as to whether there were any available funds for publishing this advertisement. He kept the country in breathless suspense for a week or two while he parleyed about it. The ques tion was referred in all seriousness to the comptroller of the currency or some other hish official, and the availability of the $13,000 left over from the former appropriation was discussed. Mean while the' newspapers of this coast be gan to grow anxious. The San Fran cisco Examiner, with its usual reckless ness, telegraphed to Statesman Alger that It would publish the advertisement for nothing, and then with marked com placency proclaimed tho fact to the world. The Express, more careful in Its business methods, win d to the secre tary that it would publish and wait on the government for payment: The Times also proclaimed a willingness not to be hard on Uncle Sam In the matter of collection. Then capitalists began to pop up in various places and offer to foot the bill But all of these magnanimous offers Were waved off by Statesman Alger. "I cannot have the government placed un der obligations to private individuals," he said. "I WILL PAY THE BILL OUT OF MY OWN POCKET!" Now, is there any wonder that, after all this rigmarole, The Herald fell into I the error of supposing that the adver ! tisir.:; for proposals was quite an unde-r- I taking? ! Since the little ten-line chick has de- veloped and we look hack at the fuss and feathers involved ln its incubation, the | whole thing becomes too funny for cx i presslon. It would make a bronze statue ' laugh. It outshines all the extravagan zas of ''Pinafore" and the "Pirates of Penzance." The mountain has been in j labor je t nascltur ridiCUIUS mu3. We hope that our dignified neighbors on the other side of the political fence LOS ANGELES HERALD* TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7,1897 will bear with us while we indulge ln a little unavoidable hilarity. An oppor tunity to laugh over such a droll esca pade of a great secretary of war does not occur many times ln a lifetime. And now we think of It, we are mighty glad The Herald did not offer to publish that "ad." either gratis or to give Uncle Sam time on the bill. Perhaps that's where the laugh comes in. "WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?" It Is to be hoped that none of the Her ald's renders missed the synopsis of the Rev. Burt Estes Howard's sermon on "Municipal Corruption—Who Is to Blame?" It was a timely reminder that the duty of the people Is not fulfilled md that their responsibility Is not re leased when official offenders are ex posed, condemned and punished. When Mr. Howard declared that bad public uTicials are "the offspring of a bad sys em mated with low political ideals, and he legitimate issue of our own political legllgence and apathy," he gave voice o a lamentable truth. It is not to be as lumed that the reverend gentleman re ers to our general system of govern nent in speaking of our bad system, but nerely to that part of It which renders uch a shameful event as the board of ducation scandal possible. Mr. Howard [oes on to say: We are a people of low political ideals; with no lofty conception of cit izenship, no high thought of the mean ing of the state. So low have we fnllon that we have come to look upon poliiics as merely tho exploitation of party greed, the devising of a method to se cure successfully, not good government, but the distribution of patronage. We are a people sold out body and soul to the market, and there Is little of that true patriotism tn us that is willing to sacrifice time and money and strength for the public good. The Herald is inclined to think Mr. Howard's characterization of the people in their connection with the system of politics is unduly severe, for he attri butes to them a positive evil inclination, or, at least, a willingness to allow cor ruption to operate in our political system and to use the system for its own vile purposes. We cannot believe that the people are so bad as that. It is the in difference of custom rather than any In nate viciousness that permits such con dition. Nevertheless, tho responsibility is the same; it rests on the shoulders of the people. There must be an awakening before there can be a change for the better, and the people must remain awake if any permanent Improvement is to be ob tained. Such sermons as that of Mr. Howard last Sunday are needed, and there should be more of them. If the people do not arouse themselves, things can only go from bad to worse. Their responsibility is not a thing that can be delegated, if their own best interests are to be served. Indifference encour ages corruption. The venal are always watching for an opportunity. VOTE THE FIRE BONDS The voters of this city should vote for the proposition to issue fire bonds to the amount of $150,000 as a plain business opportunity and in the interest of true economy. With the money to be ob tained from the sale of the bonds, new sites, buildings and equipment can be obtained for the companies, for the ac commodation of which the city is now paying rentals amounting to $SOOO a year. In addition to this, sites, build ings and apparatus can be secured for five new companies. The Interest on $150,000 ln 4 per cent bonds Will amount to $6000 a year, so that the city, ln addition to owning Its own sites and buildings, will save $2000 which it is now paying for rent, in ex cess of the interest on the bonds. It Will, of course, be necessary to es tablish a sinking fund for the payment of the bonds, and tho $2000 that would be saved annually under the bonding plan could be applied to that fund. It is plain to be seen that the city would acquire considerable improved real c s tate, new apparatus for several com panies and yet be under less annual ex pense than it is at present. The addi tional apparatus must be provided in any case, if we are to have adequate fire protection, and if the bonds are not voted the money will have to be raised by direct taxation. A vote for the fire bonds is a vote in the interest of protection and economy. ENFORCE THE LAW The non-enforcement of the saloon ordinance should be the chief subject to engage, the attention of the police commlsioners at their meeting this morning. No valid excuse can be ad vanced for allowing a few saloons to keep open all night, while others that are paying the same license are forced to comply with the law. There can be no excuse for allowing the saloon ordi nance to become a dead letter in any case. The ordinances presumably are on the statute books to be enforced. The saloon law is one of the most important of the city ordinances. If it may be violated with impunity, why may not others? If the saloon lav. - is not enforced, It has a tendency to cause disrespect for other laws and. In general, to create the impression that the statutes may be violated with impunity. Of course, this effect is not produced upon the respect able, law-abiding citizen, but it impress es a far more dangerous class, whoso interest It Is to break the law. The Sun day saloon and the all-night saloon will be . uppreeeed if the police department does Its duty. JURY BRIBING A flagrant miscarriage of justice has apparently occurred in Department one of the superior court of this county. The suspicion that the "hanging" of the jury in the Compton case was directly due to corrupt methods was raised by yester day's developments. The scandal must be traced to its root and the guilty par ties brought to justice and punishment. Suspicious circumstances of venality In our courts have been altogther too fre quent, and in this case It is sincerely to be hoped that sufficient evidence can be gained to bring home the guilt to the offender. That a defendant should boast that "he could 'hang' any jury the county could produce" is a villainous and, we believe, an unfounded reflection upon both our judicial system and the community. It will be the duty of the court to prove to the fellow that he made an egregious error. Mainly with the contributions of the railways centering there, Kansas City will build an auditorium for the accom modation of national conventions. Los Angeles is not so favored with a multi plicity of lines as is Kansas City, but those touching this place have the ad vantage of the long huul of both pas sengers and commodities, and might with propriety be appealed to in behalf of a similar undertaking which is about all we need to complete the equipment of a model convention town. A single protest from a minister, and a Chicago minister at that, Will make no difference in dear old Santa Claus' schedule. We can assure every chick who reads The Herald, or enjoys its pictorial features, that he will arrive ln the city of Los Angeles promptly on time, more generous ln his bequests than ever because of the plentiful har vests of the summer that is ended. The ex-empress of the French is, in a way, a guest of the British, and as such it would of course be highly Improper for her to launch a life of her late hus band in contempt of the expressed dis approval of Victoria. But she can with propriety go ahead with the preparation of it, adopting Mr. Cleveland's modest plan for the publication of his autobi ugraphy—after death. The desires of the national banking interest have not yet been consolidated and formulated Into an ultimatum, but It is fair to assume it would be meas urably satisfied were it designated by the United States as a preferred cred itor in the assignment proceedings. The Herald acknowledges with thnnks the invitation of the Ebell society to be present at the lecture of Harry A. An drews of Lewiston, Me., on "The Origin and Development of Journalism." which will be given at 724 South Broadway, at 2:30 oclock on Thursday afternoon. Any tinkering with the tariff now must be in the nature of a scaling down of the schedules. Increased duties will not enhance customs receipts, but only serve to enlarge the deficit. But tariff tinkering will be found a dangerous party expedient just nt this time. Congress once refused to issue gold bonds, although the inducement was a material reduction in the interest charge. It is not likely to do so un popular a thing at this late day when the temper of the people upon the sub ject is so well know-n. Alaska can scarcely be ready for a territorial or any other form of govern ment just now. The fees which 'an army of office holders would exact, under present conditions there, would exhaust the known placer treasures in no time. Thorn's lawyer is said to still be lieve in his innocence, notwithstanding the acquiescence of the culprit in the verdict. Sympathy will therefore be divided between the quiescent con demned and tho inconsolable survivor. That San Jose sheriff who deprived a female prisoner of a parcel of pepper had little regard for the fitness of things. Prison discipline should not be wholly devoid of the spice of life. ■» » » « Spanish statesmen are just now in dulging in rather extraordinary gallery plays, the gallery being assembled at our national capital. There is doubtless method in their frenzy. Let us continue to hope that Czar Reed will not ape Austrian airs and in troduce helmeted, aids ln the counting of quorums. About the only remaining asset of the National Democratic pary is W. D. Bynum, and that is a very uncertain quantity. Zola still insists that Dreyfus is inno cent. The latter doubtless regrets he cannot entertain the same feeling about Zola. Anybody may snub St. Louis. Even Cleveland did It. The act did not add lustre to Nansen's fame. Until Victoria has another Jubilee the necessity for a lieutenant general will not bo apparent. David Bennett Hill may still be a Democrat, but he is no longer a national issue. THE

AT THE THEATER 1 ORPHEUM.—A full house greeted the new bill at the Orpheum last night, and it was the best bill that has been pre sented for months, much as that com mendation means. Every turn is the best of Its kind, the kinds are especially good, and some of them are screamingly funny. Caroline Hull, a charming descriptive singer with an unassuming manner and a magnetic personality who comes direct from the eastern vaudeville houses, scored an Immediate and deserved suc cess. Her natural voice is rioh, musical, and has a sympathetic quality. In the manufactured registers it sounds, of course, forced, but never off the key; and her enunciation is perfectly clear. She Is not theatrical ln making her effects, and In the "Ben Bolt" where she dis plays the soprano, mezzo and baritone voices, her tones are correctly placed and produced. Another new turn Is a Joyous gem ln which Pordyce, an Englishman, plays ten or twelve Instruments at once by means of puppets. Seated ln a row ore eight figures life size, of different ages, sexes and in various stages of decay. A conductor faces the "band" and sud denly he pops up and the music begins. It reminds one of the Hungarian bos band—lt is so different. But it Is side splitting which is good for a change. A series of moving pictures Is also new this week, presented under the name of the Biograph. The bill says It is the most perfect of all the "projectascope" machines, and although It Showed a slight reluctance in getting started last night, the result Justified the claim made. Some very vivid, realistic effects were produced and the subjects were all new and entertaining. The little countess is a holdover and sang some blithesome little 3ongs in her little noble voice; Mile. Leopcldine, the exquisitely graceful performer on trapeze and parallel bars, repeated her beautiful work of last week. The To blns gave another enjoynble rendition of really good music in a thoroughly musiclanly manner. Misses Cooke and Clinton shot "Home Sweet Home" out of a xylophone and incidentally hit ev erything else they took aim at; and A. O. Duncan, with his puppets, kept the house in roars of laughter with some new Jokes and clever business. BTJRBANK THEATER. — "Hands Aross the Sea" was given at this house last night by the Broadway Theater company. The piece is a melodrama and rehearses the trials and tribulations of a persecuted hero and heroine and the dark schemes of a villain, winding up with peace and happiness to the foimer and just punishment to the plot ter. Miss Truax as the heroine was all that could be desired. Miss Henry as the lively little stepdaughter, made the most of her part. Maurice Drew played the part of John Dudley as well as his inflexible style would permit. As Tom Basset, Guy Bates Post made a gay young country gentleman and would have appeared to advantage as John Dudley. Chas. Hallock made a good character sketch of Jean de Lussac. The cast is long and several people played more than one part for which they werf not given credit on the program, an omission which is hardly just to the players. Chas. P. Clary as Count Paul was scarcely equal to the cool villainy of a French gamester, but appeared to advantage as Hiram Hickory. The vil lain was acceptably played by Maurice O'Connor. The remainder of the cost was well filled. The piece is prettily staged, especially the scene on the farm in Devonshire and the view of Sydney harbor, Aus tralia. All went off smoothly for a first night. "Hands Across the Sea" will be continued the balance of the week and lovers of this style of play are sure to find an evening's enjoyment ln wit nessing this performance. LOS ANGELES THEATER.—The verlscope exhibition of the Corbett- Fltzsimmons prize fight attracted a large crowd last night. The upper por tion of the house was full to overftow- ing. and the floor was fairly well occu pied. As might be expected, the audi ence was made up of men; here and there a couple of women might have been observed, but there were not many women with escorts. The exhibition was no doubt interesting to the male and female lovers of prize fights who could with undazzled eyes follow the shaky and misty series of pictures de picting the various incidents that oc curred on the memorable occasion thus Illustrated. But the interest in pugilism on the part of the people present must have been very intense to permit of their sitting out such an indifferent exhibi tion with placidity. If the pictures had been better the contentment of the au dience would have been greater. ♦ ♦ ♦
