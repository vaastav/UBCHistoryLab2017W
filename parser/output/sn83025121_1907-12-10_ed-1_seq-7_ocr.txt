Preparations for the Christmas, trade are imparting a air of activity to the streets. There does not seem to be apprehension of a por season's business felt among the merchants, as thore is no apparent reason why the holiday traffic should fall much if anything below that of former years. While capital 15 unavailable for lare enterprises in investment or speculation, the industries of eountry and town are kept running at full head. Neither reduction of numbers of people employed nor of wages- paid has been reported from any quarter. A good sugar and a splendid pineapple season have been passed, with the prospect in both industries of a more prosperous incoming year. For the ordinary purposes of internal trade, a goodly circulation of money is maintaiued, dee to the conditions just stated. With the return of financial equilibrium on the mainland, now seemingly fast coming about, a large amount of money owing to Hawaii will be released. Then our larger business transactions will speedily resume their wonted, swing from which a. period, of substantial and enlarged prosperity may be anticipated to ensue. SrGAB AND

The cane everywhere is looking welL Weather conditions are favorable. Labor appears to be plcntituL A slightly disturbing factor in the labor situation consists ia rumors that a person claiming to represent the Federation of Labor is going around the inlands trying to organise the plantation laborers of different nationalities into unions with a view to holding up the industry at a critical, stage with strikes for higher wages. It is highly improbable, though, that any effort of the kind will succeed.
