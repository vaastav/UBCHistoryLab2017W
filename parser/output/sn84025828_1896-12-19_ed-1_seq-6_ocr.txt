ANOtCR OF TI1K TURK. Baitan Wanta a Ketrirctlon from the President. Muitaphn Key, the Turkish Minister, ha received peremptory Instructions from his government to secure n retraction of the Injurious statements made by Piesl dent Cleveland In his message to Con gress. A cable was received on Wednes day tilght which Indicated that the Su blime Porte was In nn awful stew oer the matter, and the hint was given that unless this government did something the Minister would bo expected to ask for his passport. In accordance with this Hremptory dispatch from the home gov ernment the Turkish Minister sought tin nudlence Thursday with Secretary OIney and read the riot act to him. He re quest ed th.it the matter be presented to President Cleveland to the end that the President might, If possible, send In a supplemental message to Congress ex plaining the provocation which had been given the Turks to cause them to butcher so many defenseless people. The Turk ish Minister does not deny the butchery, but he does attempt to Justify It. The Minister, so It Is said, almost went to the extent of making n charge of bad faith, for he claimed that the State Depart ment was In full possession of nil the facts which would go to show that the butcheries were committed under aires of great provocation. 

IX'MHU TO DEATH. Antonio Mocco the Victim of Pnaln'a Treachery. General Antonio Ma coo. the famous Cuban leader, is really dead, having been treacherously murdered by Spaniards Dec. 7 while, on his way to attend a con ference to which he was Invited by the Marqui of Ahumeda, acting captain general of Cuba, while General Weyler was In the Held. Saturday a letter was received by Colonel .1. A. De Huau, the head of the Florida Junta, at Jackson ville, Pin., from his secretary correspon dent lu Havana, giving a detailed account of the assassination of General Mnceu nnd his entire stair, with the exception of Dr. Xcrtuchn, who wns Slaceo's phy sician. The letter came from a reliable oiiree In Havana, but the correspondent' name, of course, cannot be made public, for, as Mr. Huau said: "The writer would be shot within nn hour by Spanish authorities If they knew who gave away details of one of the most horrible ntro cities ever chronicled in modern warfare." AWFUL LOiH OF LI KB. North German Llnvri Steamer Poller Ooea Down on Corrohcdo Hocka. Vigo, Spain, dispatch: The North Ger man I.loyd steamer Sailer was lost off Cortinnas Corrohcdo.

Tuke Their Own Ltvta. Mrs. Sarah K.

Mrs. Cooper's will was discovered upon n lable in tne apartment, informing tnc worm oi flic joint suicide und requesting tliut tnc bodies be not taken to the morgue, .Mrs. Cooper and her daughter were foremost among the member of the Woman's Suf frage Association. Mrs. Cooper was, lu fact, president of the California Woman Suffrage Association mid was prominent ly identincd with church and kindergar ten work. She taught tho largest Klblu class In the world ami was a prominent officer of tho Woman's Christian Temper nnce Union. The suicide has made a profound sensation lu the city, where Mrs. Cooper nnd 'her daughter had been until recently the leaders In church and Christian affairs generally. The tragedy Is directly traceable to the recent scandal which culminated In the church trial and condemnation of Itev. Dr. Chnrles O. Brown, pastor of the First Congregation al Church. Mrs. Cooper was olio of his warmest supporters hi the early part; of the trial. Before the end of the trial, however, Mrs. Cooper and her daughter turned against him, and the pnrt of the Coopers In the enso wn In violent dis agreement with tho church element, which censured them for their activity ngnic-t t1-? r:?u:?'J c!:r7n:an.

LcaUlatlon Asked for by dov.-Klcct Hogcrs of Washington, Governor-elect ltogers of Washington has issued a copyrighted pamphlet en titled "Free I.imd." A copy hns been sent to the members of the Legislature, which moots next month. Mr, ltogers takes the sltloti that free land Is an "Inalienable, Imprescrlptnble nnd Inde structible" right of man, and draws les sons from the freedom and enjoyment of the Puynllup reservation Indians, which he thinks results from their free, Inalien able and untaxable homesteads. In con clusion he proposes an amendment to'the Stnte Legislature, providing thnt real es tate and nil usual Improvements, to a value of not to exccod-'-,,riOO, occupied,! n homestead by any private-family, .the head of which Is a citlr.cn of the United State and this State, shall be forever exempted from nil taxation of every kind. The exemption Is limited to homestead. The pamphlet states that the nmount ex empted by this scheme would not exceed 10 per cent, of the entire valuation. He said such a plan enacted into law "will prevent that fatal clash of the classv otherwise Inevitable." The pivnplilet concludes: "County government should be abolished or reduced to the merest skeleton of what It now Is. Townships nnd municipal government can attend to local affairs; let the State be culled In where necessary." VUMt FOR THI'.IU L1VK9.

I I H UjMIMrY X sSBBsW l! am MrTUHl M&L a I Horaeteaa Carrlaae. While advocates of carriages driven by motor-engines admit that much re mains for the Inventors to do beforo uch vehicles can be made equal In beauty of appearance, facility of man agement and all-around comfortable ness to the present stylo of carriages drawn by horses, yet they assert that motor-carriages nro certain to become popular because they will ativo money. In England It Is estimated that the cost of fodder for a horse traveling twenty miles a day Is twopence per mile, while a motor-wagon of two nnd a half horse power can be driven the same distance at tho expense of half a penny per mile. Another argument used In behalf of the horseless carriage Is that two thirds of tho present wear and tear of roads Is caused by horses, and only one-third by wheels. Recorded hy Raln-Dropa. It Is by carefully noting small nnd apparently Insignificant things nnd facts thnt men of science nro ennblcd to reach some of their most surprising and Interesting conclusions. In many places the surface of rocks, which mill Ions of years ngo must have formed sandy or muddy sen-beaches, Is found to be pitted with the Impressions of falling rnln-drops. In Kugland It hns .been noticed thnt, In many cases, the eastern sides of theso depressions nro tho more deeply pitted, Indicating that tho rain-drops which formed them wero driven beforo a west wind. From this tho conclusion Is drawn that In tho re mote epoch when the pits were formed the majority of tho storms In England came from tho west, Just as they do to day. The Age of Niagara. "IIow old nro tho Niagara Falls?" Is a fascinating question to which geolo gists hnvo given replies varying by tens of thousands of years. At first It was estimated that tho Niagara River enmo Into existence, through changes In tho lovel of tho land around tho Great Lakes, about 60,000 years ngo. Later this wus reduced to only 13,000 years. Tho celebrated geologist, Sir Charles Lycll, Increased tho est I inn to again to 35,000 years; but more recent ly others havo lowered It to about 9,000 years. Tho latest cstlmato Is that of Dr. J. W. Spencer, who, basing his conclusions on the most recent Investi gations, places tho age of tho river at 82,000 years, and that of the cataract at 31,000 years. At one period, many thousand years ago, tho height of Ibo falls was four hundred and twenty feet Oreson'a Wonderful Lake, Much attention has lately been drawn to Crater Lake, n rcmarkablo body of deep water occupying the Immcnso cra ter of 'an extinct volcano In tho Cos cado Mountains of Oregon. Tho namo of Mount Mnxama has recently been bestowed upon tho old volcano. It has been suggested that this mountain was onco ono of tho loftiest In America, but that ages ago Its summit fell In. The heart of tho mountain Is now occu pied by a lako of exquisitely bluo water whose greatest depth Is 2,000 feet. Tho lake Is six 'miles long 'by about four nnd a half miles In width, and Is com pletely encircled by precipitous walls varying In height from 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the water. Tho greatest ele vation of the crater rim above sea-level la 8,200 feet. Out of the lake rises a volcanic cone, called WUard Island, 840 feet high. When It has been ren dered easy of access, Grater Lake will rank, among the wonders of natural scenery, with the Yellowstone and Yoscmlte valleys and the Grand Can yon of tho Colorado. Eleotrlo Plowing. Further details are to band concern ing tho German electric plowing ex periments, which may be of service to the many farmers in tno united states who, owing to the vicinity of water power or other conditions, are In a po sition to reduce tbelr farming expens es by using electricity. The figures quoted are those of a specific Installa tion, and will, of course, In many cases, admit of considerable modification. The plowing was accomplished by two fixed windlasses, actuated by current transmitted a distance of two and one quarter miles. Each windlass re ceived about twenty-eight horse-power, which is sufficient for a plow with four shoes, which travels 100 meters In six minutes, covering a width of 1.80 meters and plowing a depth of thirty centimeters; In ten hours' time, the area plowed was 43,500 squaro meters.. As the power may also bo applied to other purposes when not used for plowing, the cost of thirty-seven horse power during ten hours Is estimated at about $8.25; the cost of the installa tion was $8,250; for 120 days per year, allowing 20 per cent for wear and tear and other expenses, and Includ ing tho wages of the five men required, the total cost of plowing 43,500 squaro meters Is $20.50. Plowing by means of horses costs at least double this amount The advantages over steam are self-evident, the apparatus being lighter, and less delicate, and requlrr. ing no transportation or comnustiDie material to the field. The expense can be.,jrei'uccd still more If the plowing bo continued for more days In the year. Where beot sugar Is manufac tured, it is suggested that the power In the factories be used for this pur pose when It is idle. This would re duce the expense still further. Seeds Borne Far by Water. It Is good for plants to keep as much apart as possible. If tho seed fell straight to tho ground, and tho young plnntB all crew up together around tlio parent ono, they would starve each other out. For plauts'nre like people, and when crowded too closely togeth er, fall to lighting among themselves, Their struggles are very bitter ones, though we 4o ''Ot or bear thaaa, The plaits tbat are strongest In theta neat battles ndibygettrngtthefllghti and air, and water and food tbcyfteed' from the soil, while the poor weak lings are left to atarvo and die. To prevent too much of this wasteful crowding nnd struggling, old Dnme Nature hns Intctted many a clover lit tle scheme. When, trees or smaller plants gtow on river banks, their fruits often fall Into the water, and are carried down stream by the current, sometimes find ing landing-places on tho banks, and so growing up Into new plants. Who has not seen sycamore-balls and buck eyes traveling along In this easy fash ion? Theso arc the fruits of thu trees they grow on. Fruit Is tho part of the plant that incloses the seed, with the seed Itself, So the dry pods that hold tho black morning-glory seeds nro as truly fruits as are npples or straw berries, though wo commonly use the word only, for those that are good to eat It often happens thnt, on small Isl ands In rivers, trees and flowers are found that do not grow on tho neigh boring banks. Theso have como down tho river, sometimes from the moun tains where It rises, In the shape of fruits, and havo found lodging on tho Island, during high, water. Sometimes fruits aro thus borne quite out to sea, and then they mny bi caught up by ocean currents nnd carried" long dis tances. It has been said that Colum bus first formed tho notion that there might bo land beyond the western ocean on seeing some strange nuts that hd been washed to tlio shores of the Axorcs from far away America. "Uow Plants Spread," In St. Nicholas. Drowning Mado Impossible. Tourists now coming back from abroad report having witnessed a cu rious sight on several of their Jour neys up nnd down the Ithlnc. Down the mlddlo of the stream, they sny, came a queer-looking monster. Lingo Inflated wings seemed to keep It nliovo tho water. In its hands It held nn open book, and tho faco of a man with a heavy mustache bent over tho book. Tho current carried the qttecrly -shaped mass along, and soon the pasacngcrs of tho boat were Informed that F. W. Kuhl, a German civil engineer, with an Inventive turn of mind, was giving an exhibition of the feasibility of his new safety cloak, which makes death by drowning Impossible. Tho construction of the clonk Is, of course, tlio Inventor's mystery. Out wardly it docs not differ in any way from an ordinary overcoat, lined with a doublo layer of rubber. It Is very light, and the material with which It Is filled Is of a kind which makes sink ing In water Impossible. It takes but two minutes to slip It on, fill It with air, and havo It thus ready for tine. Any shipwrecked person can easily spend from sixteen to twenty days swimming along In tho water, If pro vided with the trousers and shoes be longing to the now garment and tho necessary provisions for bodily suste nance. Tho cloak alone; however, is sufficient to keep a person several days comfortably on the surfaco of tho wa ter. Qatok Thoaght. It was a woman's quick thought that gavo us the prettiest of tho tune ful Strauss waltzes that and linen cuffs. Johann Strauss and his wlfo were ono day enjoying a stroll In tho park at Schonau, when suddenly tho com poser exclaimed; ' "My dear, I havo waltz In my bead, quick, giro mo a scrap of pa per or an old envelope. I must wrlto It down before I forget it." Alasl After much rummaging of pockets, it was found that neither of them had a letter about them not even a trades man's bill. Strauss' music Is considered light, but It weighed heavy as loud on bis brain until ho could transfer It to pa per. His despair was pathetic. At last a happy thought struck Frau Strauss. She held out a snowy cuff. The composer clutched It eagerly, and In two minutes that cuff was mauu script Its mate followed still the Inspiration was Incomplete. Strauss was frantic, and was about to mako a wild dash for home, with tho third part of his waits ringing uncertainly In his head his own linen was limp colorod calico when suddenly bis frau bethought herself 'of her collar, and In 'an' Instant tne-rcmalnlng bars of "The Blue Danube" decorated Its surface. Disposal or Sewage la Birmingham. One of the worst features under tne old management was the disposal of the sewage. By way of remedy two sys tems uave found adoption. Under ono the Health Committee collects the offal ot bouses, and either destroys It or turns It Into fertilisers. This Is, more offensive and less successful than It might bo made, but Is apparently a ne cessity until the pan system has been abandoned. A sewage farm of nearly 1,300 acres has been developed several mllea from tho city, somo 400 feet lower In elevation. Tho sewage, first mixed with lime to prevent too rapid decom position and to assist In tho precipita tion of tho solid matter, Is passed through a scries of depositing tanks, during which process tho mud Is re moved.
