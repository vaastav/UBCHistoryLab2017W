Henry Richter, a crazy cabinet maker, was arrested in Louisville this week on a charge of lunacy. President Cleveland no doubt wishes the would-be-Cabiuct-makers, who are meddling with his a flair could be disposed of in a similar manner. Mr. Cleveland refuses to accept presents sent to him by strangers. A large Newfonndlanddog was express ed to him tho other day, but he sent him back to the donor with a polite note of thanks. The country will be glad to note that tho President-elect will not "go to tho dogs." .Judge Richard 11. Stanton, of Maysville, who has closely examined the tenure of office act, says that those Federal officers who are hold ing by appointment of the President and continuation of the Senate, should as well disabuse their minds of the belief that they cannot be re moved until the exmratiou of the term for which they were appointed. The President can remove them at will and if tho Senato refuses to con firm tho new nominee, it in no man ner helps the suspended officer. The modified law only requires tho 1 resi dent to nominate another and may keep on doing so until an acceptable nomination to the Senate is made. Interior Journal. The official vole of Texas is the last to be reported, lint the last is the best in this instance.

Total vole, 31S,3i)5; Cleveland's plurality, 134,855; Cleve land's majority over all, 128,021. As compared with the vote of 1880, the voto shows an increase of 8o,2'J8j Gov. Hamilton, to whom was re ferred the matter of deciding the contest in Chicago between Brand and Leman, candidates for the Stale Senate, decided that Leman, Rep., was elected and that the effort to count Brand, Dem., in was fraud Milei.t. It is alleged that 200 spurious billots were put in one box and the officers in charge of the box have been indicted by the grand jury, This decision makes the Legislature a tie on joint ballot and there will be a deadlock in electing a Senator to succeed Logan. Pletch Dcinpsey, of Madieonvillo, went over to Owensboro on a visit the other day and the wicked editors of tho Messenger ran him out of town by slating that he had come to receive applications for Mr. Latl'oon, from those who desired his influence to se cure official positions. Applicants were directed to call at his room by 3 oclock P. M., but long before that hour hal arrived, poor lletch had esr.aned through a back alley and taken to the woods. It is safe to say at Woodson will not stop at Madi- sonville when lie makes his next reg- ular trip to Princeton. If there was fraud in the attempt to count in a Deincratic candidate for State Senator in Chicago, we are glad that the attempt was unsuccest- iil. A iltepublicau governor gave the decision and will issue the certif icate of election,' but the matter will be investigated by tho courts. We want no fraud by either side, and if Leman was honestly elected he linnld have his seat and no honest man would want to seo him counted out. even it a United Stales tsenaior- hip is at stake. A free ballot and a air count and a pcaceiui acquies cence iv" l ie llliuoiiiv is me mu lling indispensable to the perpetui ty o! our tti'puuiicaii loriu oi govern incut.

As ft result of the Presidential elec tion held in Mexico on the 13th of lust August Porfirio Diaz was inau guraed President Dec. 1, in a man ner befitting his eminent services as Liberator and statesman. Tho inau gural ceremony and tho accompany ing celebration was the most impos ing event ever witnessed in Mexico The oath of ofiieo was duly adminis tered to President Diaz, and after the conclusion of tin; ceremony retirin President Gonzales gracefully mail wav for his successor amid a storm of applause, the firing of cannon an the ringing of bells. Subsequently the President was escorted by a civic procession, followed by the military to the Palace, the joy of the peopl and their confidence in Diaz bein abundantly manifested. 1 itwillbe my policy," said Diaz, "to advance the commercial interests of Mexico and cultivate trade and inter course with the United States. This is the wish of all intelligent and thinking Mexicans. The mutual in terests of both republics demand cloe ' er relations." He hopes through the introduction of railways into Mexico that international travel will become general and the consequent inter course will remove many false im pressions now existing and create a feeling of mutual good will. The General expressed his admiration of J. merican people and institutions. Georgiana and Josephine Conway. sters, walked up behind John Lo . , I ! 41... irall 1111(1 . 08.

We can hardly bring oursclf to realize that Zeno Youiig.thc jolly, ge nial, companionable editor of the Madisonvillc Times, is no longer one of us. A press meeting without Zeno Voiniff would be like the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out. Good bve old fuilow ! We have been friends, live brothers almost, for six years and though vou have quit shoving the pencil you shall not be forgotten. Mav Heaven smile on you wherever your lines may fall. It is believed that the sympathy for Logan will induce some Demo crat to break the tie in the Illinois Legislature and re-elect Blaine's run ning mate. It may also be remarked that an excellent opportunity is af lorded for a "sell out" on both sides. A pretty good price could be paid for the one necessary vote. Most of the leading Democratic and Independent papers of the east, with the New York World in the van, are booming Conkling as Sena tor from New York. The Legisla ture is Republican by 14 majority, but the scheme is for the Democrats to unite with Conkling's personal following of 15 or 20 and elect him to succeed Lapham. A Postal Telegraph. In view of the power shown by Jay Gould over the Western Union Telegraph Company and tho Asso ciated Pross, and the manifest dispo sition on his part to use it in 'behalf of his favorite Presidential candidate, tho following utterance of Senator Windoin, of Minnesota, just before his appointment to be Secretary of the Treasury, is exceedingly apropos : "The channels of thought and the channels of commerce thus owned and controlled by one man, or by a few men, what is to restrain corpo- ato power, or to lix a limit to its ex actions upon tho people? What is then to hinder these men from de pressing or inflating tho value of all kinds ot property lo suit their caprice or avarice, and thereby gathering in to their own collers the wealth ot t lie nation? Where is the limit to such a power as this ? What shall be said of the spirit of a free people who will submit without a protest to bo tuns bound hand and loot? AVith a postal telegraph on the plan proposed lo the last Congress by uon gressmau Sumner, of California, and Senator Edmunds, of Vermont coup led with a Civil Service system which would placo the tenure of office be yond partisan control, such a danger is that above noted would bo obvia- t.id. Referring to the existing situa tion, the N. Y. Times says: 'For the past forty-eight hours Mr, lay Gould has been using the Wes tern I uion Telegraph to spread abroad through the United States false information as to the result of the election in the Stale of New York The proof of l his is well known to ererv intelligent journalist in New York. Mr. Gould did the same thing in October with reference to the elec tion in Ohio, when not one specif! statement capable if veriticat.ou or exposure was allowed to pass ova1 tho Western Union wins for more than thirty hours, and when the state ments that were sent were shown within two davs to be conspicuously and intentionally false. As to the vote of New York the plot has I nearly identical and has been carried out with more persistence. The re turns have been sent out in lumps of election districts,' which are not named and cannot be iudenlitied, and the publication, of these has bee, made in amounts and at times to suit the schemers. Occasional pn iiuuciunicntos from the.B'aino Com mittee have shown that returns from comparatively remote point' have been used promptly, while those from points within an hour's ride of the Western Union Building have been helfl back. "Mr. Jay Gould's performances for the past forty -eight nours have made a Government Postal Telegraph a necessity m this country. Electricity is the quickest, and therefore the most valuable, mi ans of conveying intelligence. The peo ple of the United States paid for con structing tho first line of telegraph for Prof. Morse between Baltimore and Washington, thereby demonstra ting the feasibility of using electricity lo convey intelligence. Instead of adding it to our postal system it was allowed to pass into the hands of cor pjrations, which have used it as a means of taxing tho people rather than to give them its service at the lowest practicable cost. If it had de veloped with our postal system, ex ports estimate that we would now be sending messages at a cent a word throughout the length and breadth of tho United States. Doe9 anyone suppose that if our present postal system had been run for cornorate profit rather than for public benefit that postage would have been reduc ed from a shilling per letter to two cents? As regards the integrity of management, it must be placed some where, and does anyone suppose that it would not bo safer in tho hands of the Post Office Department, directly r sponsible to the people, than in the hands of a corporation responsible to no one Keuublicaiis line senator Edmiinds and Democrats like Con gressmau Sumner, of California think that it would be safer in the hands of the people, as it is in all oth er countries of the world.

The last number of the Madison- ville Times contained the valedictory of "t8 editor and owner, Zeuo. I Young, and the paper ceased to exist, alter having been successfully con ducted for nearly 19 years. For over twelve years Mr. Young has been its editor and proprietor and under hi management it was a model country paper. He has sold the entire office and outfit to the Gleaner and the two naiiers will be merged into one. The terrible accident which befell the edi tor last summer and his continued disability, the sickness of his family and business reverses that followed his personal misfortunes, are given us reasons for the step. Iso man in . the Kentucky Tress would be missed more than Zeno Young. Ilis clear, concise, fearless, and forcible stylo of dealing with things made his paper a favorite with his brother-editors, lie made the Times a live, newsy and readable paper, and at the time of his almost fatal fall from his office window, the paper was prosperous and safely established on a money liiuking basis.
