Got. Borkman has issued an address to ' i the people of West Virginia in roference to raising our proportion of the 300,000 men lately called for by the President. He says I A the enrollment has not jet been oompleted, and, henoe, the quota of this State has not jet been fixed. The terms of the enlist ments ef the different classes, their bounty, and by whom the enlistments may be made, ?re stated as follows : * a a j 1 Soldiers now in the field who have less than one year to serve, and men who have served nine months, or over, and have been honorably discharged for other cause than disability, will be entitled to a bounty of 3402 in addition to his regular pay, and will > rasaim $62 of the bounty and one month's pay-? making $76? before he is required to 1 do duty j and at the first payday (about two months) after being mustered into ser- 1 viee he will receive $50 bounty, in addition j to his regular pay ; and $50 in addition to I his regular pay every six months thereafter until the bounty is fully paid. All other able-bodied men of proper age, may volunteer and will be entitled to a bounty of $302 in addition to his regular pay, in pretty much the same enstallments as the first named class. j Enlistments of all persons nut now in the service may be made by any person, and the person recruiting will receive for a rc cruit of the first-named class a premium of 9 25 , and a recruit of the last $15. All persons recruited as above indicated are to be mustered into the old regiments of the State. 1 When the quota of the State is ascertain ed it will be duly announced. We sincerely hope, and certainly believe, that the Governor's plain, concise and pro per address will command the earnest at Aention and active co-operation of every good citizen of our State, and that a vigor ous and united ett'ort will at once be made f to secure the necessary number of volun teers, and thus, in rendering a valuable ser vice to our country, honor ourselves by preventing the humiliation of a draft The Legislature adjourned sine die yesterday afternoon, and many of tie members have already left the city for their hornet. The session has been a lengthy and laborious one, and much has been accom plished to set the wheels of the new State Government to running smoothly. A vast deal of labor has been performed by the various Committees, and many important measures have been perfected and passed into Laws. We respectfully tender to each and all of the members, on departing from our city for a season, our best wishes for their sale re turn to their homes, and long, successful and useful lives. The Cincinnati Papers of the 7th pub lish a series of charges and specifications against Quartermaster F. W. Hurtt, of that city, from which we condonse the following exhibit of that gentleman's rascalities. ? There are four charges with seven teen speci lloations : Charge 1st. ? Selling, without proper or ders for that purpose, embezzling an J mis applying Commissary and Quartern liter stores, belonging to the United States. The specification to this charge show that Hurtt sold flour sugar, vinegar, mess pork and large quantities of hay, com, and oats, belonging to the Government and pocketed the proceeds. Charge 2d ? Conduct unbecoming an of ficer and a gentleman. Tue specifications to charge No. 2 are ex. ceedingly voluminous. They show that Hurtt and one S. H. Dunan, connected with the Ohio State Journal , engaged in pur chasing horses and forage for the stated purpose of benefitting their own private pe cuniary interests, and to relieve the Ohio State Journal from pecuniary embarras ment. They also show that Hurtt and Dunan having a contract to supply the troops at Camp Chase with rations, conclu ded to increase their profits by furnishing rations of an inferior quality- That Hurtt opened a correspondence with the inn of Messrs Cook & Co., baukei^, Washington^ D. C., to use their influence to have him (Hurtt) transferred to Cincinnati, where heavy purchases for the Government would be made advising Cook as to what purchases it would be necessary to make and as suring him it would be "all right1' with him, with the intention of defrauding the Gov. ; eminent. That he became interested with 1 one Geo. 8. Scott, in large purchase* of for age for the Government, and that by infor mation given Scott he (Scott) was enabled to purchase large amounts of Hurtt's vouch ers, in the profits of which Hurtt was inter ested. Letters of Hurtt to Scott are pub lished, and fgrm one portion of the specifi cation to this charge showing the fraudulent intentiom of Hurtt. Tb? specifications to this charge show that in letters to Jay Cook , 6 Co., of Washington, Hurtt expressed doubt of stability of the Government, and evineed alarm for his friends whom he in duced to pnrchase his vouchers , that Hurtt corresponded with parties connected with the Ohio State Journal explaining how he made hit purchases so as to preclude the possibility of being detected in his frauds upon the Government. Charge 3d? Stealiug, embeixling, and misappropriating and -applying to his own use, money or other property of the United States* The specification! to thif oharge show tltt Hnrtt was in the habit of corrnptly and fnmdulently reporting on his rools the names of perions not ; employed, and did" report certain amounts at hating been paid" to said parties; that he fabricated false and fraudulent reoeipti for forago, etc., etc.j that he employed and sent to the army a man by the name of Manley, as a correspon dent pf the Ohio State Journal , and had the said Manley'e name entered on the pay rolls of the government, and did pay him ont of government funds. Charge 4th? Conduct to tj?o prejudice of good order and military discipline. The (specification to this charge shows that Hurtt, in order to promote the pecuni ary interests of himself and friends, did attempt, by the influence of moneyed and political parties, to secure the removal of Capt. Dickerson, his superior officer, that he Hurtt might obtain Capt. Diekerson's position, and thus be charged with the heav iest disbursements of the Goveroment, as- 1 suring parties that such a change would be ! of great pecuniary benefit to the Ohio Journal and "all right" with his friends. The charges and specifications against this man Hurtt, of which we are able to give only a synopsis, disclose an immense amount of fraud and rottenness in the man agement of his department. It is however but a repetition of fraud and corruption which during the past three years has been so often told that the public feel but little interest in it. A dispatch from the Headquarters of the the Army of the Potomac dated the 9th, sayt, three deserters from the 5th North Carolina Regiment, cause within our lines last night, and state that their whole ment only await the opportunity and they will desert, en masse. From reliable authority we learn that Gen. Lee's Army occupied tho following positions : Hill's Corps around Orange C. H., where Gen. Lee has his Headquarters ; Early's Division, near Suinuierville Roads at Morton's end Tobacco Fords; Johnson's Divisional Mitchel's, Brown's and Ger maiiin Fords. The rebels claim that Lee has 60,000 troops and was certain of victory j had Meade have had the rashness to at tack him. The rebels in Cumberland, Wayne and Clinton counties of Kentucky, are proving very troublesome. They often make raids across the Cumberland, destroying property stealing horses, and conscripting citizens. Forty-two hundred Chattanooga prison ers have passed through Louisville, North. The Army of the Potomac seems to have fettled down for the Winter, and the men are building comfortable quarters and other wise preparing for cold weather. A Chattanooga dispatch dated 10th, says that Geu. F. P. Blair aud.Gen. Wilson, of Gen. Grant's Staff, arrived from Knoxville to day. Blair goes to Congress at once. Gan. Sherman has a heavy force at Knox ville. Two hundred and seventy-four men died of wounds and disease in Chattanooga hospital in the last seventeen days. Guer rillas are very active between Chattanooga and Knoxville. The Bedford (Pa.) Inquirer raises the name of Abraham Lincoln for President* and Henry Winter Davis for Vice Presi dent in 18G4. Those who fight should vote, says the Abolition Chicago Tribune. To which Prentice retorts: And those who vote should fight. The Richmond Dispatch 6ays : "The de feat of Bragg, which has long been fore seen. Las taken, as far as we can learn, no body by surprise." The Confederates have completely block aded the Mississippi at the mouth of Red river, by garrisons stationed on the Arkan sas shore. Nothing but iron-clads can pass, and. as there is no trade, no effort has yet been made to raise the blockade. The situation of affairs in the Army of the Potomac remains unchanged. The rebels of have taken position on three prominent hills on the south side of the Rapidan, where they can observe all move ments of our army. Two rebel infantry regiments occupy Fredericksburg. Hawkins, one of the parties in the re cent kidnapping case at Montreal, has been tried and found guilty. The trial of Joshua R. Giddings, the American Consul at Mon treal, on the same charges, is sot down for the 17th mst. The millennium is certainly coming id some charters; or this world is greatly giv en to lyiDg. In the New York Herald , a ?hort time since, were published two letters from lraudulent contractors, which had been sent to Mr. Secretary Chase. The first contained Silo, "due U. S. Taken by default." The writer of the second letter says: "Enclosed you will find one hundred and ten dollars, which I received from my country by fraud, a shor, time ago. It was my first offence, and. so help me God, it shall be my last. I was induced to take this under the fallacy that to cheat the Government was not a wrong; but I have signally failed to make my conscience be lieve it." It is thus that conscience makes cowards of us all. When a shoddy contractor turns honest, and sends back money that he has stolen, it does seem that the time for a general disruption of all things has come about. A Correspondent of the Army and JVavy Journal suggests a plan by which steamboats may defend themselves against guerrillas on the Mississippi river. It is to place on the deck of each boat a piece of artillery, imooth bore, a six or twelve pounder, so arringed that one or two men can train and fire it rapidly in every direction. Protec tion against small arms should be put up around it It should be the exclusive duty of one man to have charge of the gun and ammunition, and to stand by it whenever there is any probability of. an attack. ? ^ ? iyi t ? Elijah Ray and wife, who were as they stated, flying from the land of witches, were arrested at Shepherdsville and taken to Louisville- The old man said that he had left Ohie on account of being troubled with witches, and was going South. Col. Hol man, post commander, sent them back to the land of witches to remain during the war. ? ? ? ^ A number of fashionably dressed women were detected in Memphis with their stock ings, hoops, bustles and busts well filled with contraband articles, which they pro posed to carry with their precious persons through the lines. They were accomdated with lodgings in Irving Block. ? ? m The Senatorial election to come off in the Kentucky Legislature is the theme of general conversation in Frankfort. Those prominently named in connection with tho office are Governor Braralette, Hon. James, Guthrie, and Hon. Joshua F. Bell, with the chances in tavor of Mr. Guthrie. There is now a clamor for the removal of General Meade. He has not taken Rich mond, or won any great advantage ; but he has not met the disasters suffered by Burn side and Hooker. He was too good a Gen eral to undertake an impossibility and in sure a defeat. From recent "bull" and "bear"' editorials in the New York papers it is inferrod that there are two great parties growing up among the Republicans ? one for an endless stock jobbing war, and another for an hon orable pcace ? ** ? ? ? 

FROM WASHINGTON. \ Special Correspondence of the Wheeling Register . | Washinoton, Dec. 9, 1863. My usual letter has been deferred one day by indisposition, fiat you obtain the main points iq Congressional proceedings each day by telegraph. You have also, doubtless, seen the publi cation made by the War Department in justification of its action in the case of Wm. T. Smithson. But the Department pub lishes only its side of the testimony, which perhaps it judge?, in what seems to it the present debased and degraded condition of American National spirit, will be sufficient to justify, Well, even if it were, still there is nothing to show that Smithson should not have beon tried by a civil court and been convicted according to law, to be finished off by the punishment duo to a traitor. Of course you Lave read of all the out cry upon Etheridge, Clerk of the last House of Representatives, whereas he did his merest and plainest duty according to law. But the Abolitionists know of and care for no law, even if they have made it themselves, which in the smallest degree puts their un controlled despotism into peril. My hope and belief is that they are themselves ad ministering the only cure the malady of their supremacy is capable of: they will so thoroughly overdo their work that human nature must throw then off a* impossible to be borne. One of the samples of this sort of thing may be seen in Lovejoy's mo tion to make the ownership of slaves a penal offence. In this light the sages and heroes of the Revolution would be fit inmates for the penitentiary. But in patience we must possess our souls. We were all greatly relieved on the open ing of the Supreme Court to perceive that Judge Taney has not resigned, as the malig nant fanatics had caused to be rumored. The Russian fleet is still lying below our city, and the officers occasionally come up into our streets. They arc not a particu larly fine body of men, nor is their intel lectual appearance very striking. Of course they receive much attention wherever they go. The common sailors are a tolerably good looking set of fellows, with short faces and stout persons, but they have not yet had much opportunity of showing their prowess on any test occasion. Genl. Hitchcock is out in a long argu ment intended as a justification of the course of the Government in its imbroglio with the Confederates on the subject of ox changes. Gen. Hitchcock's argument may do very well for Abolitionists, but for men not yet drunk with thd intoxications of that class, he proves nothing as it should be proved. In a word "the nigger' has been the whole cause of the horrid controversy. But who ever knew a fool or a fanatic that would yield to reason or humanity ? The Government must find a better rhetorioian than Gen. Hitchcock or be content to re ceive the disapprobai ion of mankind. The reported capture of Gen Meagher J does not seem to elicit much sympathy from ! any class of people. They would as soon he were taken as anybody else. I do not know whether you West Virgin iaus have lost all interest in the " Old Do minion," but the Legislature going en at Alexandria is a grand affair. Governor Peirpoint ia, ef course, "chief cook,:' as usual, and his Western Virginia experiences 1 cause him to be looked upon as a patriarch in political cookerv and "small chores'" of that kind. His !' Legislature" will not fail ! to gratify him in doing just whatever he chooses, and he chooses just whatever his , guides in Washington dictate shall be done. The President's message is this moment oat ; no time yet to consider its contents i with care. Yours, <3tc^ Pinnace, i A story is told of a western candidate that cam# upon "a poor white man,:" who had a rote to give. If he did, have to do his own milking. Thejcaudidate. Jones, asked him if he should hold the cow, which seem ed to be uneasy, and the old manconaented very readily; he took her by, the horns and held faat till the operation was done,? Have you had Robis&n (hit rival) round here lately?'' he asked. "Ob, yes; he's behind the barn, holding the calf!"

HOUSE OF DELEGATES. Friday, Dec. 11. Prayer by Mr. Thomas Copley, member of the House. A communication was read from the Sen ate, when, there being no further business before the House, a recess was taken until 2 o'clock. AFTERNOON SESSION. The committee on Enrolled Bills sub mitted a report which was adopted.

[This resolution elicited warm encomi ums in behalf of the Speaker.] By Mr. Crawford.

On motion of Mr. Lamb, a committeo ot two were appointed to inform the Senate, that the House was ready 10 adjourn. A message from the Senate announced that that body was ready to adjourn sine die. A resolution was offered, declaring the House adourned sine die. Tbe Speaker (Mr. Patrick) said before he declared the body dissolved he desired to make a few remarks. When he assumed the duties of Speaker, he knew and felt the arduous duties devolving upon him. If, in his decisions he had given offence to anyone, he begged to assure them that no such intention had a place in his breast. ? The session had beeu a protracted one, but as it was the first Legislature there was more buisness to be transacted. The ses sion had beeu harmonious as well as labori ous. Trusting each member would have a safe and pleasant trip to bis home, and there find the loved ones in th i enjoyment of good health, ihe Speaker bid tdem all farewell, and declared the Houie adjourn ed sine dti. ^ ^ The Head Soldier Identified. We recently published the account of an unknown soldier found dead on the battle field of Gettysburg, holding clenched in his stiffened hand the photograph of his three children, on which he gazed until ho died, j The photograph was taken to Philadelphia, I and a large number of copies have been sold. It is now ascertained that the name of the deceased was Hummerton. His widow and three cliidren reside at Port ville. Cattaraugus County, New York. The profit realized from the sale of the pictures wil! be appropriated to tbo benetit of the children. It is hoped that a sufficient sum may be realized in this way to aid mater ially in the education of the little one* who were made orphan? at Gettysburg. The bouty offered by the Government to volunteers will only be paid to \hose volunteering prior to the 30th of the present month In tropical climates a man ain't sit in safety under his fig-tree, for fear of snakes and tarantulas.
