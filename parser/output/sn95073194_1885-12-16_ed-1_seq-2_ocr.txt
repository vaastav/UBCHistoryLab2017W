This makes Mr. Reed virtually the leader of the minority. He is considered the ablest -man ia the House on a quick retort. He Is very strong also ia attacking and answering the op posite party in debate. And indeed most of the debating ability in the Hoase is on the Republican side. The Senate, which is always quiet and orderly, was unusually so to-day. It met, organised by electing Sen ator Shermaa president pro tern, to succeed Mr. Hendricks, and adjourned tbroagh respect to the memory of the late VicePresideat, whose chair was covered with black.

Although great cau tion has kept the message from pre mature publication, its contents are pretty well known. It will be use less for me to give you its points, however, as you Viil probably read it in full by the time this reaches yoa. The forty-ninth is the first Dem ocratic congress to meet under a Democratic administration since the days of ex-Presideat Buchanan. The country will be watohfal to see how much the party has learned since treasoB shouted in tho capitoi and plotted In the cabinet. Twenty-sir years have passed away, thirteen congresses have come aad twelve have gone since, on the first Monday in December, 1859, James Buchanaa, the last Democratic predeceeeor of President Cleveland, sent his annual message to congress. Some of the senators aad represen tatives who assembled at the capitoi to-day were there oa the first Mon day in December, 1859. If they will cast their eyee over this beautiful city, recalling what it was then and noting what it is now, they will have a guage by which tV measure the change wrought in the nation during those twenty-six years. Every measure of public policy which has contributed to the magni ficent advancement of the country in all these years has been a Republican measure, and has been carried against the united and unrelenting opposi tion of the Democracy. There is much preparation for the finauclal battle to be fought this win ter. Hon.

During the last session the Senate secured the adoption of the plan to make cabinet officers the successors of the President and Vice-President in case of the death, removal, or disabil ity of both. The bill failed in the House by the obstructive manage mentof a Democrat from Connecticut Mr. Eaton. But the first subject brought to the 1 attention of the House will probf.bly revision of the rules. Every member wants them changed, there is no question about that The trouble Is In finding enough members who want the same change. Each mem ber sees how a certaia change would promote the passage of his little bill, aad he will vote for that In the multitude of schemes, the outcome is uncertain. He Itotea.

I then went under treHsmout of one of the prominent allopntbic physicians for months with no better results Then I went to New York and secured the services of one of the most distinguished pbyhiciaus there, who prescribed for me for weeks and failed to give reiief. I then went to Philadelphia and went under the care of the cel ebrated Dr. Agnew for many weeks, and derived no appreciable benefit. Disheartened, I returned home and suffered on for some years. I went first to Healing Springs, Ala., then to Hot Springs, Ark., and then to Blount Springs, Ala., from all of which I received some benefit, but no permanent relief could be secured. Iu 1882 I again put myself under the care of one of the best physicians, aud alternated between comparative rolief and sufferings that seemed beyond my power to bear. It seemed no matter what I did, as if it were impossible to rid myself of the poison.
