He suggests a further cure for financial misfortunes, that Congress should authorize a npeclal Issue of certificate or bonds for the sole purpose ami use of the national hanks as a basis for security for their circulation, and the retirement of outstanding bonds or certifi cates. The new bonds should bear Interest at the rate of 22 ner cent, and run fifty years. Thy should be dellevered at par to the banks, and the latter should then be given par value of clrculat'.on. This sys tem would encourage the organization of natirmil banks and enlarge the circulatinR medium of the country. He predicts that the povernment will in a short time be able to secure long-time loans at very low rates of interest. In the interest of depositors, in the event of a heavy run on a national bank, Mr. CLaypool believes the bank should have authority to take three days time in which to meet the demands. This period, of grace would enable the bank to secure funds and keep open their doors for business. Where there are clearing houses, he recom mends that certificates should be permitted to issue in times of panic. Mr. Claypool clones with a recommendation for an inter national arrangement to maintain the value of our outstanding silver. The iecommend ations of the distinguished Hoosler financier were much favored about the Senate to-day. 3IYTIIICAL I'UXSIOX FRAl'DS. Hoke U'nniM Approprln t Ioum De creased nnri Kxnensen Inercnsetl. WASHINGTON. Dec. II. Efforts are be Ins made by Secretary' Hoke Smith's de partment to back up the unfounded state ments mad? In the President's message in regard to pension frauds. The Presideht as sert ed that thousands of neighborhoods have thir well-known fraudulent pension ers, and he declared that enormous frauds Yud been unearthed since Hoke Smith took Charge of the Pension Bureau. About the only frauds which have been brought to light are a fw in Virginia, some In New Mexico and some alleged in Uuffalo, X. Y. A statement has been stnt out from Secretary- Hoke Smith' department to the ef fect that great frauds have been discov ered, but no names are given, no places are mentioned and nothing definite of any character Is furnished, further than a mere statement that the frauds "promise bin lesults.'- This is the kind cf news that is being fumlshod to order from the Pension Bureau these days. I there were any frauds otl er than imaginative ones, which "would startle the country," the bureau would promptly give the particulars. An effort is now being made to get a de f.tiency appropriation from the House com mittee on appropriations, of $,0A for the payment of salaries and expenses of spe cif examiners for th- remainder of the fis cal -;ar. The entire amount appropriated by the hist House for this work for the pi'etent ttseal year was ?Ji.o,(M. jjut Secre tary Hoke Smith wants J'oo.tt) more. This Is for the payment of men who trav:l al out th country, according to the speech es of the Democrats in the last Congress, to do political work. In the last year of fr- :Ievtland's former administration Jilo.QOO were expended in payment of sal aries aii,i expenses of special examiners. ill1 Mh'n President Harrison came into ofrce, a:,d the Democrats got control of the House, thsy reduced the appropriation to itlo.fJMj, u.nd for this year cut tro amount to .1.10.000. Now Secretary llcke Smith wants It increased to half a million, and to make an argument for this sum he sends LicaUa.-;t wholesal? accusations against the pensioners, as did the President In his mes sage, alleging enormous frauds and not giv ing one single fact to sustiin the charges. Ihe country was recently flooded with statements of "monstrous frauds," dis covered in Buffalo, x. Y.. but so far not a single person has been punished, growing out of these alleged frauds. In two months this administration has been able to con vict thirty-nine persons of pension frauds. That is more than the average under pre vious administrations. And. considering the fact that there are &0,012 pensioners on the rolls, this conviction of thirty-nine persons in two months, while more than doubling the expense for special examiners and other officials, shows how little real foundation there is for this outcry against the old vet erans. Secretary Hok Smith is asking for an appropriation of 2.0m,oiio to pay surgeons' fees. The entire amount paid out last year for that purpose was S3,2S3. For clerk hire he wants another enormous in crease. But for the old veterans he asks for jr.00O.(Xw less. It Is to work up a feeling In behalf of these large appropriations for special examiners, clerk hire, etc., .that stories are put out about "enormous frauds." and no particulars are given. The report of the Commissioner of Pen sions shows that there have been pensions Issued to the number of 21.518 to survivors of the war with Mexico, who receive service pensions, and nearly all of whom are ex- confederates. Although this war closed nearly half a century ago the percentage of pensioners on the rolls as compared with the total number of men engaged In the war with Mexico, is almost twice as great as the percentage of (tension! issued to vet erans in the civil war which ended only twenty-elsht years aso. Hut President Cleveland and Secretary Hoke Smith and the Pemocratlc party have not a. word 10 pay about the pensioners of the Mexican war. About twenty members of Congress from Southern States are drawing pensions under the Mexican Mar pension act in ad dition to their salaries. This will account for the silence of the Democratic party on that particular pension roll while at the same time trying to discredit Union veter ans by baseless tales about enormous frauds.

Chairman Wilson lias been away from the House, and members of the committee s ty th.it h is engaged In Lreparin the majority report, which is to be submitted next Tuesday. It Is not ex pected that any further action will be taken on the Internal revenue features of the bill until all members of the majority may be In the city to consider It. The individual or corporate income tax must be settled before the committee can proceed. A ques tion has arisen as to whether the Income tax can be levied in time to derive revenue for the next fiscal year, as It has been stated that the tax would have to be levied on Incomes of the year following the time when the law goes into effect. Mr. liryan, who Is pressing the straight-out income tax plan, says that the tax would be levied on incomes of the calendar and not the Ms cal year, nnd that If an Income tr.x Is adopt ed it will be on incomes from .'an. 1, 1S34, to Dec. 31 of that year, and the taxes will fall due in January, 183.1, and be available for the expenses of the fiscal year ending June 20, 1X'jT.

Address to the People of the United States by Leadintr Citizens of the Sandwich Islands. PROTEST AGAINST OUTRAGE They Claim the Revolution Last January Was Necessary, And that the Ke-Establishnient of the Monarchy and Return of Liliuoka- lani Would Be a Crime, SEATTLE. Wash., Dec. 14. A. Feek. a Seattle contractor, arrived home to-night from Honolulu, where he has secured a contract for constructing a railroad. He was made the bearer of an address to the people of the United States from the Ameri can League of Honolulu. It says: "We, like you, believe in good govern ment, and having, In co-operation with oth ers, freed ourselves from the reign of cor rupt rule and established a government of the best classes of society, we protest, most emphatically, against the reported assump tion of President Cleveland that the pro visional government of the Hawaiian isl ands should cease to exist, because the prop osition for union with the United States of America had failed to meet his approval. We insist that the present government of Hawaii has the same right to exist that the United States had after Ihe successful rev olution of 1776. In fact, the corruption and mlsgovernment that brought about the rev olution of January last were so flagrant as to be unbearable, and the late Queen had planned to not only continue her corrupt rule, but set aside the Constitution of the kingdom and attempted to illegally promulgate a new one, dis franchising many of the most In telligent citizens, and by her high handed outrages, destroyed the last hope of improvement over the corrupt and illegal at Tession of the executive power, so that no alternative was left but to depose her and establish an honest and capable gov ernment. This has been successfully done, not by the citizens of the United States, but the movement was carried to a success ful issue by people born and raised on the Islands and others who had resided for many years here and were citizens cf the country and loyal to its best interests, and only organized for the overthrow of the old system after all hope of redress for the many wrongs done by the late Queen and her partisans had ceased to exist. "We are ready to acknowledge that we, loving liberty and good government, hon estly admlnstered, approved of the deposi tion of the late Queen, and the organization of the provisonal government, and gave to the said provisonal government our hearty support, because we know that It repre sented the best and most advanced religious, moral, social and business interests of the Islands, and we assert that these several interests are so united as to form a govern ment strong enough to attend and maintain itself against all Internal uprisings or in surrections, and that the well-known char acter of thoe at the head of affairs gives positive assurance that the government will be honestly admlnstered and that the rights of the people will be honestly ad ministered. "It has been asserted by the adherents of the late Queen that the President of the United States would forcibly, if necessary, enthrone the late Queen and' re-establish her authority. We cannot believe that Pres ident Cleveland has been so ill advised, but should he so decide we appeal to Congress and the people of the United States to pre vent so great a crime against liberty and good government. "The right of revolution has been a well established method of deciding great wrongs and checking- the encroachments of kings and despots generally and by no people has the right been more generally acknowledged than by the American peo ple; and In appealing to her people, especially as we have right, truth and jus tice on our side, we feel that we shall have a candid consideration of our claims of recognition. "So confident are we in the justice of our cause that we are certain that our course, will receive the approval of the American people, regardless of party. "Ve Insist that if Hawaii is not wanted in the great sisterhood of States, that we be al lowed to continue a government that is honestly administered, and we feel that we have a right to vigorously protest against tho re-establlshment of a corrupt monarch on these islands. "Having confidence In the great liberty loving citizenship of the United States, we Invite the fullest and freest investigation, confident that an unprejudiced Investigation will prove that the revolution of January lait was not only justifiable, but absolutely necessary to maintain our rights and guard the best Interests of our population as well, many of the most intelligent of whom are active supporters of the piovisional gov ernment and opposed to the re-establish-ment of the monarchy."

The Presi dent is himself now engaged in writing the message, which probably will not go to Congress before Monday. Meanwhile a steamer sails from San Francisco to Hono lulu to-day or to-morrow. All that the navy and State departments have collected on Hawaii Is now In the President's hands, having been taken to him to-day, and none of It will be made public until he send3 it to Congress.

The Standard, refer ring to the Hawaiian situation, says; "The j knot of merchants, speculators and office , seekers who planned and carried out the I revolution in Hawaii and constituted them selves a provisional government, are, as might be expected, furious at President Cleveland for having decide! that the United States must decline to accept the island offered to them as a result of ne farious intrigue by American citizens. No other decision could have teen expected from an honest and honorable man; but it has astonished the group of adventurers who thought they "would be enthusiastically h?iled by a grateful, country for what they had really done only for personal advan tage.

TARIFF Federation of Labor Delegates Kefuse to Discuss It. Platform Presented to the Delegates for Discussion and Action Several Kesolut ionVAdopted. CHICAGO, Dec. 1L The delegates to the American Federation of Labor convention, to-day, refused to take action on a commu nication touching upon the question of the tarllf. The matter came up in the form of a communication from the plush workers of Bridgeport, Conn., which declared that after the passage of the McKinley bill their wages had been reduced, and that their employers threaten a further reduction in the event of the passage of the bill. The communication was laid on the table, and the delegates fought shy of any discussion on the subject. At the request of 'two hundred students of the Chicago Theological Seminary two representatives of the federation were ap pointed to expound its principles at a gath ering of students this evening. A number of resolutions were adopted as the sentiment of the convention a? they came from the committee. The theory of the government ownership of the telegraph of the country was approved, the election of United States Senators by popular vote was Indorsed, and the president of the fed eration was authorized to draft a bill mak ing it compulsory for manufacturers to place exhaust fans In their manufactories. The convention expressed itself as being in favor of compulsory education. It was resolved to petition Congress to enact a law establishing postal savings banks in view of the inadequacy, as the resolution expressed it, of the present national bank ing system. Representative Lewis Nash, of the Retail Clerks' National Association, read a paper on the future usefulness of the federation. He advocated government ownership of the telegraph and the railroads. He said: "The country now has too much law, with too little justice. We should stand shoulder to shoulder on election day and vote for measures, not for men; for statesmen, not for politicians; for humanitarians, not for demagogues." Chairman Morgan, of the committee on resolutions, submitted a programme for the nationalization of ' railways, mines, tele graph, etc., as proposed by English econo ?nlsts, as a basis for the political labor movement. A motion to have the matter presented to the organizations of the feder ation for the purpose of lmving their del egates instructed to vote upon It at the next convention of the federation received the support of a number of delegates and the disapproval of others. The platform has twelve planks in it, as follows: Compulsory education; direct legislation; a legal eight hour work day; sunitary inspection of work shop, mine and home; liability of employers for physical disability; abolition of contract labor In all public works; abolition of the sweating system; municipal ownership of street cars, eieotric light and gas plants; nationalization of telegraph, telephone, rail ways and mines; collective ownership by the people'of all means of production and distribution; the principle of referendum in all legislation. It was moved to have the resolutions taken up and voted upon seri atim. There was a contest this afternoon be tween the conservative and socialistic dele gates regarding the adoption of the princi ples of a platform to be submitted at the next, annual convention. The conservatives came out ahead. The committee on resolu tions brought up a programme containing the fundamental principles of independent labor politics. A recommendation accom panied the report to the effect that the planks should be submitted to the favorable consideration of the labor organizations rep resented, the socialistic delegates being against the use of the word "favorable" and the conservatives In favor of it. A res olution was adopted favoring a series of national and International congresses or conferences of labor, the same to culminate on May 1, 1901, In an international demon stration of labor organizations in all coun tries. Strikers AhIc AHNlMUince. rrtOVIDEN'Ci:, R.

Lew AVnllace'd Cirief. Dan Macauley, in Washington Tost. Strolling down Droadway, I asked Gen. Lew Wallace what were his special com plaints against fate all men have them but here was one, I said, of so apparently perfect a life, healthy and happy in every prized relation offarnily, fame and fortune, a prosperous lawyer, an able general, an unusually line musician, and an artist of recognized ability, a gifted orator, a con spicuous honor to his country as foreran minister, and last, and greater than all. an author whose fame will never die while books are known to man. "Xow," I sal 1, "what is your particular lament, your ac cusation apalnat the existence of thlriK as you :ind them, your pilgrim's, bundle of woe and disappointment?" We walked along siowly a moment, and finally lie admitted, half reluctantly, that he hardly knew how to answer that really fortune had been kindly gracious to him and yet but of 'course it was laborious to travel over the country lecturing. "Yes," I assented, "that's hard." And sometimes six niarhts a week, he said, now here, now there. Jumping from place to place as his tyrannical agent sent him. Again I acknowledged the evident se verity of it. "And more than that." he warmly summed up, glancing at me rather sharply, "some days they compel me to lecture twice, afternoon and evening!" Of cours", in a worldllnsr like myself, sympa thy was somewhat hamstrung by thoughts of tho wampum pouring in upon him. but just then .he melted, and snnpRling up to nvs revealed In fervent tones the veritable skeleton at the feast of his existence. "It may be true that I have been favored in some degree, as you Insist; Indeed, my life does seem to have been what men call hap pily successful, but. honor bright, what worries me is that I've invented a fishpole and can't do a thing vith it.

COUGHLIN TRIAL 3Irs. Foy's Brother Coming: from Scotland to Testily. Testimony in the Monson, Dr. Meyer, As sassin Prendenrnst aul Other Fa mous Criminal Cases. CHICAGO, Dec, 14. The prosecution in the Coughlln case devoted its energies large ly to-day to unraveling the mystery sur rounding the story of the wagon in which Cronin'3 remains were said to have been carried from the Carlson cottage to tha catch basin. It was stated positively this afternoon that Joseph McLaughlin, the brother of Mrs. Andrew Foy, now In Scot land, will Tail for America in a few days. He will be used by the prosecution to com pel And rev,' Foy to tell all he may know of the case. At the former trial Foy claimed that he could remember nothing regarding the secret meetings, and If his brother-in-law testifies, Foy would be compelled to talk, it is said, or be attached for contempt of court. It Is reported that fears are en tertained that an attempt will be made to abduct Mrs. Foy to prevent her testifying in the case. Policemen, it Is said, have been detailed to guard the Foy house and pre vent such an occurrence. Unconfirmed rumors wero also current, this afternoon, that counsel for the State have disagreed as to the manner of conducting the case and that cither Assistant State's Attorney Ilottum or associate counsel Scanlan may withdraw from the case. Policeman Strib testilied to-day that he was on duty on the night of May 4. He was called to testify to having seen the mys terious wagon, but his evidence was strong ly objected to by the defense. The objection was overruled, however, and the witness stated that at 11:30 o'clock, on the night in question, he had seen three men In a car penters' wagon drawn by a bay horse. In the wagon was a large trunk. He was un able to describe the occupants of the wagon. The vehicle, at the time, was going in the direction of the catch basin in which the body was afterwards found.

TUB MOSOX TRIAL. Evidence of the CJnnniaUer nnd Re sult of Kxperlnients hy Doctors. EDINBURGH, Dec. 14. The Monson trial was continued to-day. The court wa3 crowd ed immediately after the opening of the doors. There were a number of ladles pres ent, but Mrs. Monson was not among them. McNaughten, the gunmaker, upon cross examination, admitted that, regarding the position of the body and the trees, he was dependent for his information upon Messrs. Whyte and Carmlchael. An important part of the evidence consisted In deductions from the examination of the skull and from pho tographs of the head of the deceased. Coun sel said that he was unwilling to ask that the real skull be brought into court, and for the purpose of cross-examination asked leave to use another skull. The cross-examination was long and severe, and during its cifurse McNaughten said the groove In the skull was caused by scattered shots. The fracture in the skull, witness contin ued, was caused by four pellets which were found in Lieutenant Hambrough's head. Witness also said that the charge nearly missed Lieutenant Hambrough, and that the four pellets alone killed him. McNaugh ten admitted that he, under the supervision of three doctors, experimented uion three dead bodies at the Edinburgh morgue. He iired shots at these bodies in an oblique di rection. Witness fired as the doctors di rected, and they placed him in position. Photographs taken showed- the effects of the shots. Counsel Did you see the effects of the experiments on the bodies? Witness I did not look. Counsel Well, 1 don't wonder; it was a ghastly job. The cross-examination produced a sensa tion in court. Witness admitted that no one was present on behalf of the prisoner during the experiments already referred to. This caused a buzz of excitement through out the court room. The next witness was Dr. Llttlejohn. and he gave a mass of technical evidence de scribing the post mortem examination, say ing that he believed that the gun which killed Lieutenant Hambrough was fired nine feet from the deceased. It was impossible, the witness continued, that the injuries ln llictel upon the deceased were the result of an accident. Dr. McMillan, vho made out the certifi cates of accidental death, and who wrote to the Mutual Life Insurance Company, of New York, to the effect that the Lieuten ant died by his own hand, testified that after so doing he concluded that he had been too hasty. Mr. Martin, district manager of the Mu tual Life Insurance Company, of New York, testified that Mr. and Mrs. Monson. called upon him, and said a young gentleman who was coming into a fortune of nhW.O'O wished to purchase an estate, and that Mrs. Mon son was going to advance him f20.000 and wanted to Insure Lieutenant Hambrough's life for the same amount in order to cover the advance. Continuing, Mr. Martin said that after two medical examinations of the deceased lieutenant the transaction ' was completed by Mrs. Monson giving the life Insurance compai' a check lor the premi um. Witness also said that when he heard of the Lieutenant's death he made inquiries and saw the procurator liscal. iihadv von Tin: iikfi:.se. Testimony for the Prosecution in the 31eycr Cte Concluded.
