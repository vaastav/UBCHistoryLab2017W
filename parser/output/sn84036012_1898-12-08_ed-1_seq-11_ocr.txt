Immortal George Washington. in his last will and testament, dated June .. 179., Bald: "It has always been a smorce of serious regret with me to see the youth of these United States sent to foreign countries for the purpose of education. It has been my ardent wish to see a plan devied on a Uberal scale, which would have a tendency to spread systematic ideas through all the parts of this rising empire. Looing anxiously forward to the accomplish ment of so desirable an obiget as tuas (in my estimation), my milid has not been able to contemplate any plan more likely to effect the measure than the establishment of a university in a cen tral part of the United States, to which the youths of fortune and talents from all parts thereof, might be sent for the completion of their education. I give and bequeath In perpetuity the 50 shares (value $500 each) which I hold In the Potomac company toward the endowment of a university to be estab lished in the District of Columbia un der the auspices of the general govern ment." Thus. in his will, spoke George Washington and the first conception of the idea of such a university seems to have occurred in October. 1775. In his military camp at Cambridge, Mass.. when Samuel Blodget, afterwards an author of note. remarked in answer to a complaint against the militia for the damage they were doing to the colleges in which they were quartered. "Well. to make amends for these injuries. I hope after the war we shall erect a no ble nat'onal university, at which the youth of all the world may be proud to receive an education." The father of his country replied: "Young man, you are a prophet, inspired to speak what I am confident will be one day realised. A This project was dear to the heart of George Washington. but the trust was neglected and the value of the legacy lost. It remained for the women of to- s day to take the matter in hand and it is generally understood that what wom en undertake they will accomplish. t There has been formed the George Washington Memorial association. thet objects of which are to carry out the 1i Ideas and wishes of the illustrious5 George Washington by first rromotinst Interest in his bequest for the estab- t lishment of a national or central uni- t versity for the higher. learning, a post- i graduate unyerstty that shall complets 1 the American system of public educa- n tion and furnish facIlities for further m advancement. Secondly. by ralsiug C 'unds for the erection of an "Adminis- t .ration Huliding" for the univers ty, the ,orner stone of which shall be laid on tr near the hundreth anniverrary of his 4 wquest.

George Dixon. the featherweight champion of America. has been matched to fight young Pluto, the Aus tralian champion. Dixon and the for eigner have agreed to try conclusions In a 20-round bout before the Olytnplc club of San Francisco some time in February. It is Tom O'Rourke's inten tion to take his stable of boxers to San Francisco after Sharkey has had one more fight In the East. which will probably he with Kid Macoy. The ar rangements for the Pluto-Dixon match were made some time ago. but rumors to the effect that the latter would not fight again left the match an uneertain ty. However. Dixon has not decided to retire for a while at least, and will take on a few good ones before he leaves the ring. Pluto I. said to be the cleverest boxer at his weight that Australia has ever produoed, barring that wonderful fighter, Toung Grito. He comes to this country with a clean record. THE NICARAGUA CANAL. A PrepeatleS to Gamantee Its Neo- W trellty. New York. Dec. 7.-A dispatch to the L Herald from Washington enys: The p senate committee on the Nicaraguan g canal will add to the canal bill now C pending a provision Intended to bring C about a treaty with Great Britain for J a joint guaranty of the neutrality of g the canal. Thia provision is embodied A in an amendment which has been pre- * pared by Senator Harris of Kansas. who Is one of the closest students of the problems relating to the construc tion of the canal, as well as one of the a most earnest supporters of the canal p project in congress. The Harris amend- G ment will authorize the president to C negotiate a treaty agreement with p Great Britain for a joint agreement for p the permanent neutrality of the canal. F It is designed to meet the English ob- C jection that the plans of congress for r American construction and control fly C in the teeth of the expressed terms of ' the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. i The failure of the president to make g any mention In his message of the ex- a latence of that treaty has called forth p a note of criticism from the London p newspapers. particularly those which p are regarded as representing the views I of the British government. The presa- I dent's failure to refer to the treaty is I construed as encouraging to congress I to go ahead without any reference to I the terms of that document. which I Great Britain contends are and ought I to be still in force. 1 The American contention has been, of course, that Great Britain's violations of the terms of that treaty have been such as to practically abrogate it, and certainly such as would give this gov ernment full warrant in going ahead with the construction of the canal with. I out any reference to its provisions. It is Senator Harris' idea. and Senator Morgan agrees with him, that the sim- t plest way to prevent any misunder- I standing is to authorise the president to make an agreement of the kind con templated by the amendment.

Great Malls. Dec. 7.-The subject of the revenue derived by the residents of Northern Montana from the wool in. dustry has been made the object of considerable investigation on the part of the Benton Press. That paper com putes the total from this source of wealth to have been about three mil lions of dollars during the past sea son. It says: "A tabulation of the wool shipments from the various railroad points in this I section of the state give a total of shout 14.0MW10 pounds. A large pro portion of the clips sold at 16 cents and I over. but taking the low figure of 15 t asets as an average` It will be found I that the Northern Montana wool cllp r of the best season had a value of at r least S3.10,10. and doubtless consider i ably excesed that amount. "The mutton shipments also repro r seated an amount reaching the million dollar mark. The principal shippers were the Eastern buyers and specula tors. J. B. Long of Sycamore, Ill., pur ohased over 126.60 head in Northern Montana during the past season: Mer rri & Libby bought over 45.600: C. W. Miller of Winonsa secured about 25.6W bead. P. B. Sherlock of La Fox. Ill.. purchased some 3.111 head along the line of the Great Northern. About 230.006 bead were bought by these In dividuals or firms. To this must be added the purchases made by Mesiars. Rice. Ragland. Parkhurst. Hamilton. Seeklse and others, as well as quite a , number of shipments made direct by e individual owners-additions which would make the total shipments over 300.000 head for the season. *The proes paid ruled from $2.75 to $3.50 per bead for weathers of all ages. and $2.11 and $2.35 for lambs. the latter I probably forming 20 per cent of the It total purchases. An average value of a $3.00 per head would be a reasonable es timate to place upon this mutton out * put, or a total of about $1,100.. for d the aggregate of over 381.011 head ship* * ped. p "The grand total of over 11.0M.MO is a heandsoeme contribution by this in * dustry to the annual reveaue of the people of Northers Montana."
