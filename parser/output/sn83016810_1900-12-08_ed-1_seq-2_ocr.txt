SATURDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1900. On Monday a decision was handed down in the Supreme Court of the United States confirming the constitu tionality of the separate coach or "Jim Crow" car law of Kentucky. The case- originated in the failure of the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad to comply with the Kentucky law, which requires separate cars for white and Afro-American passengers.- The law was upheld by all the State jourts, and the company appealed to the United States Supreme Court on the theory that the law must necessarily interfere with interstate commerce, and that the State Legislature had passed it with that intention. In deciding the" case tp-day and up holding the law, so far as it concerns passengers wjthin the State of Ken tucky only, Justice Brown quoted the decision of the Kentucky Court of Ap peals, that the law in question really intended to regulate the action of 1GeorgeDo you like the new pin? MabelYes, dear, I'm simply stuck on it. 2George (a moment later)Ye Gods! So am I!!! railroads within tucky, and that passage in that the State, of Ken a passenger taking State and railroad companies receiving passengers are bound to obey the law so long as they remain within the Kentucky! jurisdic tion. Justice Brown holds that white and Afro-American passengers traveling from one State to another cannot be separated by law, and in upholding the law he expresses the, opinion of the Supreme Court permitting States to pass separate coach laws, but pre venting the application of the same principle to interstate commerce. President McKinley, in his message to Congress, denounces lynching in these words: "In my inaugural address I referred to the general subject of lynching in these words: 'Lynching must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States. Courts, not mobs, must execute the penalties of the law. The preservation of public order, the right of discussion, the integrity of courts and the orderly administration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our gov ernment securely rests.' "This I most urgently reiterate, and again invite the attention of my coun trymen to this reproach upon pur civilization." At Lebanon, 111., two Afro-Ameri can farm hands were tortured by two white tramps because they refused to steal. The tramp3 tried to compel them to steal poultry from the farm ers of the vicinity. Upon their re fusal they were dfagged to a log fire in the woods, their shoes and stock ings were removed, and their feet held over the fire until the flesh was nearly cooked, and they became unconscious. When they regained sensibility the tramps had. fled. After two days the victims were able to crawl with great difficulty and pain to a farm house, where their wounds were attended. The Chicago Federation of Labor has thrown down the bars to the adter mission of Afro-American workmen. This is an event of more than or dinary importance and if upheld by organized labor generally will prove mucho to his regret, for he has grown of great-benefit to the race. There are many skilled non-union Afro-Ameri cans employed in the city and they have practically forced the labor unions to recognize them. 

AFJBO-AMERICAN COUNCIL. Sab.ExecutiveCoinxnittee to Meet in Wash iagtoli: December 38, 1900.

C, Friday, at 12 o'clock, noon, December 28, 1900. As. this will be the first meeting of the sub-executive committee since the annual meeting in Indianapolis in August last, it is of the greatest im portance that all the members should attend. The test case now pending in the matter of the new constituti6n of Louisiana is to be further considered in the light of what has been accom plished by the committee having the matter in. charge during the past year. The question of the reduction of Southern representation in Congress and the Electoral College under the new apportionment, under the pro visions of the Fourteenth amendment will also be thoroughly considered and a plan of action suggested. The question of a more thorough organization of the council in all the S.tates and Territories will also be discussed and 'plans to promote the work of organization outlined.

Price, $1.25. Amer ican Book Company, New York, Cincinnati and Chicago. Manual training is now recognized, as a most important factor in education as it gives a" true dignity to labor and calls attention to the place of hand-work in human progress. As civiliza tion goes on it will undoubtedly have a higher and still higher place in the hearts of the people. Mr. Charles H. Ham washair, one of the first and foremost advocates of introducing manual training into our public schools and to him has been due ni a great measure the-. remarkable suc cess of this system throughout the -coun- "Historical/ Encyclopedia of Illinois," edited by Newton Bateman, L. D. D., and Paul Selby, A. M., (Mnnsell Publishing Company, Chicago and New York), is a great royal octavo of 608 closely printed pages. It is printed in clear-faced type, full gilt, with handsomely designed morocco covers, with many excellent illustrations, showing the Illinois of the past as well as the State as it is to-day. But the value of the book is in its mine of information, wherein the topics are arranged in ad mirable order for easy reference. While Illinois does not date back to the earlier great events of the republic, yet her his tory is unique, and we may say, without disparagement to any, that it stands in the front of the States of the great West. It is in Illinois that the first white settle ment was made northwest of the Ohio river, wherefore the State was thus 'the pioneer in Western civilization, and has continued to hold' its advanced position through all the years since. Well may the editors emphasize "its steadfast loyalty and patriotism, the marvelous development of its? resources, the number of distinguished statesmen, generals, and Jurists it has furn ished to the government, and its grand record in the exciting and perilous con flicts on the slavery question." It was in Illinois that the anti-slavery battle was fought and won, before the marshalled hosts of 1861 entered the field. There are over 1,200 biographical sketches of persons who have been or still are prominent in Illinois. They include those of pioneers explorers. State officers, Congressmen.other public oflicers.ahd professional and business men of prominence. Besides the biogra phies there are brief sketches of all coun ties and of all cities or villages exceeding 500 population. Then there'are longer a tides on many, historic, educational, topo graphical, and other .subjects. Upon the whole, the work fully merits the dignity of its title. The publishers are entitled to the thanks of those interested in -State history for their enterprise in bringing out so complete and, handsome a volume.

The Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post has taken some trouble to collect the returns from the different institutions of the country, and there is scarcely an exception to the re port of an unprecedented increase in the number of students. This affects not only the universities, so-caUed, but all the colleges of every class and size through out the Union.- Such an institution as Princeton, for in stance, reports an increase of 40 per cent in the freshman class. Harvard has the largest freshman class in .the history of any American institution. Columbia has an unpr-6cfctif.,tid ir.cr.ase. Yale has 000 freshmen... with an* increase of more than 10 per cent in every department, and the Western colleges are fully a ^prosperous. The collegiate institutions of the country, some 400 in all, have a combined attend ance of between 100,000 and 200,000, and the tctal is' not far from the 200,000 mark. During and after all periods of prosper ity the private schools and the cdjleges secure an increased membership, for the evident reason that people are better pre .pared t'o pay for the instruction of their children. That the figures have this year gone far beyond anything ever before known is, of course,' largely accounted for by the increase in population but, while allowing fully for all that, it is still true that tne number has greatly exceeded any former proportion in the population sta tistics of the country. It may be well to- explain that the word college, as referring to American institu tions, is on the average more true than the word university. There are, in name, more than one hundred universities in the United States. Actually, however, there are not a half dozen but in these days, when a "professor" may be any thing from a bootblack to a Sanscrit scholar, it would be idle to quarrel with mere names.
