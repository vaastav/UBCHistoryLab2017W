Congress gave respectful attention to President Taft's message today but there were comparatively few lueintiers who were willing to concede the probability or favorolble action at the present session in many recommendations contained! therein. The message was delivered to, both houses soon after they convened at noon. The reading of thei document which was of unusual j length was begun at 12:19 In the! Senate. At llrst most of the senators listened attentively to the reading, but gradually?this attention ceased, and those who remained In the Senate chamber devoted themselves to the printed copies before them. In the House close attention was paid to the reading at the beginning. but soon interest lagged and many left the chariiber. The full message follows: To the Senate and House of Representatives: During the past year the foreign relations of the United States have continued upon a basis of friendship and good understanding. The year has been notable as witnessing the pacific settlement or two important international controversies before the permanent court of The Hague. Tho arbitration of the fisheries (lis- I pute between the United States and f Great Britain, wbicb lias been the ' source of nearly continuous diplomatic correspondence since tbe fisheries convention of 1818, bos. given an, award vrtittlf is ssaSf^rary to both " pnrtles. Xhls arbitration is particularly noteworthy not only because of the eminently Just results secured, but also because it Is the first arbitration held under the general arbitration treaty of April 4, 1908. between the Uulted States and Great Britain and d!si>oses of a controversy tlie settlement of which for nearly ninety ydhrs has been the cause of .friction between two countries whose common interest lies in maintaining the roost friendly and cordial relations with each other. Xhe United States was ably represented before the trlbunnl. Xhe complicated history of tbe questions arising made the Issue depend more than ordinarily In such cases upon the care and slilll with which our case was presented, and 1 should be wanting In proper recognition of a groat patriotic service if 1 did not refer to the lucid historical analysis of the facts and the signal ability and force of argument? ' ? S 1 ?1%A I SIX Clays in leogiu?preseuicu iv iuc court In support of our case by Mr. Eliliu Root As secretary of state Mr. Root bad given close study to tbe intricate facts bearing on tbe controversy and by diplomatic correspondence had helped to frame tbe issues. At tbe solicitation of tbe secretary of state and myself Mr. Root, though burdened by his duties as senator from New York, undertook the preparation of tbe case as leading counsel, with tbe condition imposed by himself that In view of his position as senator be should not receive any compensation. The tribunal constituted at The Hague by the governments of tbe United States and Venezuela bas completed its deliberations anil has rendered an -? - r?i* jlin Orinoco awaru m mc vuo? v<. >.uw ? Steamship company ngnlust Venezuela. The award mny be regarded as satisfactory since !t has, pursuant to the contentions of the United States, recognized a number of Important principles making for a judicial attitude la the determining of international disputes. In view of grave doubts which bad been raised as to the constitutionality of The Hague convention for the establishment of nn International prize court, now before the senate for ratification, because of that provision of the convention which provides that there may be an appeal to the proposed court from the decisions of national courts, this govern rabut proposed In an Identic circular note addressed to those powers which bad taken part in tne l^onuuu i maritime conference that the powers signatory to the convention. If confronted with such difficulty, might insert a reservation to the effect thut appeals to tho international prize court In respect to decisions or its national tribunals should take the form of a direct claim for compensation, that tho proceedings thereupon to be taken .should be In the form of a trial de novo nod that iu de incut of the court should consist of compensation for the Illegal capture Irrespective of the decision of the national court whose judgment hod thus been Interna! inmilly involved. As the result of an informal discussion it was decided to provide snch procedure by means of n epyaraJte.Drotocol - 

BLIZZARD ATLAm * * , 4 wincii snould be raflBed'' afiSo same . time as the prize court cooTentlon It- I self. Accordingly the government of the Netherlands at the request of this gorernment proposed under date of Hay 24, 1010, to the powers signatory to JThe Hngn.- convention the negotiation of n supplemental protocol embodying stipulations providing Tor Ibis alternative procedure. It Is gratifying to observe that this additional protocol is being signed without objection by the powers signatory to tbe original convention and tbat there Is every reason to believe that the International prize court will be soon nliiblblitsl. Tbe Men tic circular note also proposed that the interautlotinl prizecoart: when established should he endowed ' with the functions of ini arbitral court j of justice under and pursuant to thee recommendation adopted by the Inst | Hague conference. Tbe replies revelv- ! ed from the various powers to this pro- ' posal inspire the hope that ibis nlso may be accomplished within the reasonably near future. It is believed tbat tbe establishment of these two tribunals will go it long way toward securing the arbitration of many questions which ha to heretofore threatened antl at times destroyed the pence of nations. TO APPOItfTfEAGE GOMMIS SIGNERS. President Is Waiting For Expressions From Foreign Powers. Appreciating these enlightened tendencies of modern times, the congress at its lost session passed a law providing for the appointment of a commission of flee members "to be appointed by the presilient of (he United States' to consider the expediency of utilizing existing international agencies for the purpdse of limiting the armaments of the nations of the world by Interna tlona'! agreement and of constituting the combined navies of the world an international force for the preservation of universal peace and to consider and report upon any other means to diminish the expenditures of government for military purposes and to lessen the probabilities of -war."

A preliminary ' diplomatic agreement has been reached regarding the arbitration of pccu- , niary claims which each government has against the other. This agreernent, with the schedules of claims annexed, will, as soon ns the schedules ' are arranged, be submitted to the senate for approval. i An agreement between the United 1 States and Great Britain with regard to tue locariou 01 me lumuauuiiui boundary' Hue between the United States nnd Canada In Passumaquodrty bay and to the middle of Grand Mahan channel was reached In n treaty concluded May 21, 1010. which lias been ratified by both governments nnd proclaimed, thus making unnecessary the arbitration provided for in Ibo previous treaty of April 11, 100S. The convent ion concluded .Tan. 11, ICtyO; between the United States and Great Britain providing for the settlement of international differences be- , tween the United States nnd Canada, including the apportionment between the two countries of certain of the hnnn/inh- wntnrs and the nnnolntment ' of commissioners to niljust certain otb- : er questions, lias been ratified by botli . governments and proclaimed. The work of the International fisheries commission appointed In 1068. under the treaty of April 11. 1008, between Great Britain and the United States has resulted In the formulation : and recommendation of uniform regulations governing the fisheries of the boundary waters of Canada and tbe , United States for the purpose of protecting and increasing the snpply of food fie!) In snob voters. In completion of this work the regulations agreed upon require congressional log Islntlon to rnaUo them effective and for their enforcement In fulfillment of the treaty stipulations.

A new order from the department of justice is being carried out at the United States marshal's office, which requires that any papers to be served be sent to the deputy at the time actually nearest to the point at which they are to be served, without regard to any conventional territory which may have been assigned to any deputy. As a matter of fact, the lawhas never provided for a division of territory among the duputics of any district, but some such system must be pursued to keep the officers from doubling and to tentatively "cover" the district. Marshal Doyle stated the other day that the new line-up which is under consideration will come much nearer to according with the order referred to above, than the old division which lias been in operation Tor some time.
