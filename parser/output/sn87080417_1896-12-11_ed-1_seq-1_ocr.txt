The Sportsmen Do Not Deplete the Forests Hot the Market Hilnters Large Num bers of Birds Shipped by Thein. A Better Trespass Law Needed, The chapters devoted to " the de struction of game birds and ani mals," and to "the violations of our game and fish laws " are of especial interest to sportsmen. In them ho shows how wild game has played an imKrtant part in the development of the country, but that now to the great multitude of the people of the State game is no longer in any sense an essential factor in the food sup ply. ' It is a luxury, and sold at prices which make it such, and the traffle is one of large proportions, with much capital invested. lie says the sportsmen must yield to the game dealer, or the game dealer give way to the sportsman and asks which it shall be. The interest which is of least advantage to the community must give way and the ono which is of para mount public importance must be preserved. Either game must be saved tor the enjoyment of those who pursue it for the sake of pursuit.for the bene fits derived as a recreation, or it must be given up to those who sim ply regard it for the value it repres ents. He soys from the many care fully reports obtained from the grouse counties of the State it is shown that 00 per cent, of all the game is killed by market hunters and shipped to the large cities. That over 1,500 grouse were shipped in one season from two stations on the Delaware, Lackawaxen & West ern Railroad and Wilkesbarre & Eastern Railroad to New York city. That young grouse are shipped with woodcock during the month of July. This market hunting is not done by the farmers or their sons but by professional market hunters, who traverse over farms and en closed grdunds respecting no rights and who become impudent when requested to leave. He states that it is the consensus of opinion that there is no use to at tempt to propagate game so long as this state of affairs exist, and sug gests a reasonable trespass att, and the restriction of the game traffic so that it will include deer, wild turkey, ruffed grouse, woodcock and quail, and thinks this would meet the views of the landowners, and all interested in preserving and increasing our game. The fish laws are also being vio lated in all parts of the state, and the doctor thinks the violations of the game laws are as numerous as thuse of the fish laws. Snaring birds is widely practiced, and he says ferret are so generally Used in the pursuit of rabbits in gome of the Northern counties that they are called " punching sticks," and that in one county, Wyoming, two hun dred were owned for hunting pur poses. Doer licks, turkey blinds, quail traps, dead falls, box trails, snares and ferrets all play an im portant part in helping to deplete our rapidly decreasing game sup ply. Running deer rith dogs, and shooting them at deer licks is albO carried on to a considerable extent in several sections of the State. Anti-Overcoat Club. Several Stroudsburg gontlemon in cluding Editor Morey, Dr. Walton, J. D. and W. S. Shafer, Wm. Gulick and A. V. Miller have agreed not to wear an overcoat this winter under penalty of a large forfeit. They will probably wrap themselves in the sweet consciousness of the good example they are setting others. Suoeautul FUlilng. "Doo" Steele and brother went to Sawkill Pond lust Saturday and succeeded in raising 44 fine pickerel through the ice, and on Monday lunt the sume party accompanied by W. F. Bock hud their shingles tip ped 47 tiuies and got the tipjers. MILFOKD, PIKE COUNTY, PA., FRIDAY, Notes From the Pennsylvania Experiment Station. The State Experiment Station has recently issued the first number of a series of Bulletins of Information. It is the intention, in this series of bullotins, to present, to the farmer in simple and concise form the re sults of investigation and the best available scientific and practical in formation on the various branches of farming. The first bulletin of the series is entitled "Computation of Rations for Farm Animals." It consists of two parts. The first is a brief ex planation of the principles upon which the computation of rations is based. Following this, Part 2 shows by numerous examples how these principles may be applied to the daily problems of the farm. Ex amples are given of the improve ment of rations, of the compounding of rations from given feeding stuffs, and in particular of the selection of feeding stuffs with reference to economy in their purchase and use. It shows how an intelligent applica tion of the principles of Part 1 may enable the farmer, by exchanging one feed for another or by wisely proportioning his feeds, to reduce the cost of his rations and at the same time improve their quality and add to the fertility of his farm. The bulletin is being disturbnted at all the farmers' institutes held in the State, and will be mailed free to any resident of , the State applying for it. The Station has also issued a re vised edition, in more convenient form, of the spraying calendar for which there was so large a demand last year. " The annual Reports and quarterly Bullotins of the Station will be sent free of charge, on application, and inquiries on agricultural subjects answered so far as possible. Address, II. P. Armsby, Director, State College, 1 Centre Co. , Pa. Vacclnnatlon Compnlsory, Judge McPherson, of Dauphin county handed down a decision re cently in which the court holds, that the right of any citizen's chil dren to attend the publio schools is not complete until they have com plied with the conditions which the legislature has seen fit to impose. The act of June 18, 1895 requiring school directors to demand certifi cates of successful vaccinnation, as a condition precedent to admission to the publio schools, is a "valid police regulation, and as such con stitutional. If the compulsory edu cation act and the law tinder consi deration are in irreconcilable con flict the former statute must give way, because the Publio Health Act was last enacted and therefore takes precedence of the other. , Perished In the Slorm. Among the viotims of the great, blizzard, which raged in the north west on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of lust woek is numbered a Deposit boy, Henry M. Burrows a mail clerk on the Northern Paciflo R. R. He left his train which was stalled at Devil 's Luke, North Dakota to go to town for provision and perished in the storm. His wife and children live in Deposit. War of Beef Companies. ( The two large and wealthy meat corporations, the Armour beef com pany and the Swift meat company of Chicago are engaged in a lively competition at East Stroudsburg in building cold storage warhouses. Each are at work as rapidly as pos sible pushing their structures, which will cost about 110,000, to completion. News Via Stroudsburg. A Stroudsburg dispatch to the Philadelphia Press says: Measles have broken out to an alarming ex tent in this county, that schools in Matu moras have been closed and two deaths reported. All of which is the sume kind of stuff that dreams are sometimes made of , a disordered im'. agination.

On another pai,e will be found a synopsis or Mr. Clevelands lost words as Chief Magistrate to the American people. It has the gen eral tone of one who is willing to shift the burden of responsibility on his successor, and outside of his re marks on the Cuban, and revenue questions, it is little more than a resume of Department reports. His discussion of the Cuban matter is temperate, and in harmony with his previous attitude. It may be judged that his sympathy with that strug gling people is much stronger than his language and that he feels re strained because of his position, and in order that our Government may not lose her influence with Spain in aiding to bring about a settlement. - ; Congress at its last session passed resolutions declaring that our Gov ernment ought to use ' its good in flnenoes in the direction of Cuban in dependence. The message discloses that the President has in a measure used his office, but not for independ ence. It has been more in the line of having Spain grant autonomy to Cuba, or in other words conceding some measure of home rule. It cannot be known whether this would be possible or acceptable, even if this country should find some means of guarenteeing to Cuba its execution.os no response has been received. He treats the deficit rather lightly and thinks the pre sent tariff bill will produce ample revenue if given a fair trial, thus impliedly opposing the 'passage of any emergency measure. It is con sonant with himself to say this for any other view would be to condemn his own policy. Married Women mm Incorporators. Attorney General McCormick holds that subscription to the Capi tal stock of a corporation whereby a married woman becomes an incor porator, is a contract upon her part to pay the sum so subscribed. If she may make a subscription to the Capital stock of a corporation and be liable on such a contract, it would seem that she would be fully qualified as an original subscriber or incorporator and liable as such. Brooks vs. Merchant's National Bank decides that a married woman may now enter- into a partnership, and as a result become individually liable for all the debts of the firm. Killed Near Lackawaxen. Monday night a freight train eastward bound struck and killed just above Lackawaxen, a man who proved to be George Kirkham aged about 39 years. He was walking on the track going to visit a friend. His father was William Kirkham of Rowlands and he also had a brother Howard, and two sisters one the wife of Thos. J. Ridgway of Rowlands. The commissioners besides hav -ing their office newly floored, hav had the walls painted in an artistic manner. E. C. Wood has demons trated that it is not necessary for Milford folks to go out of town to obtain ornamental work fully up to city ideas. 1 Obituary Note. Daniel D. Everett a son of John Everett, of Montague died Tuesday aged four years. The funeral will be held to-day at eleven o'clock.
