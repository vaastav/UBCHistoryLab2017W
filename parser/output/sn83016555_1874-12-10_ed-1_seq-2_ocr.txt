A 

REPUBLICAN FORM OF 00VERH1ŒIT From indications that sur found withers is reason to suppose that the authorities of Louisiana may be compelled to demand of the federal government the lawful exe cution of that provision of the conEtitution which requires it to guarantee to each State a republican form of government. A republican government is that which has been adopted by the vote of citizens qualified by law. This government must be executed by officers and representa tives chosen by a majority of the voters. There can be no assurance that all these voters will go to the polls, and ii the aggregate vote cast in a State fall be low the whole number of qualified voters, there would be no reason for setting aside an election for such cause. When, how ever, it shall appear that such portions Of the voters of a State have been under duress by fear of life or (under the law of Congress) by deprivation of employment, and that officers acting under the law have been systematically prohibited from performing their duty in organizing or executing the official administration of the government and laws, a case of ob struction to the representative choice of the people will have been proven. It will, in such case, then be apparent that no government in form republican exists in such State. It will then become the duty of the federal government to guaran tee, by a new election and inaugura tion of lawful officers and representatives, such Republican form of government as was intended aud enacted by those who framed the federal constitution. In such case the Stato authorities can give no relief under the legal judgment on the returns and election of its own members, because these State authorities are them selves held in duress and their legal fane rions paralyzed by violence. It is not expected that Congress will act upon the ex parte statement of a news paper, nor that it will perform a duty so grave upon the complaints of Republicans evicted or excluded lrom office. Congress may send a committee to investigate the facts before taking steps in compliance with any call to be made by the proper Stute authorities. It is a case differing from the mere existence of domestic vio lence. We will, as a guide to this inquiry, state succinctly the reasons which may be alleged for this demand on the federal government by the State authorities of Louisiana : 1. An appeal has been made to Con gress to determine between contending claimants for seats in that body. This incidentally involves a decision upon the legality of the State government. , 2. Disregarding this appeal, one of the parties on the record has organized a military force throughout the State with the effect: 1. Of driving the State gov ernment from possession of the offices. 2. Of keeping from the polls, or control ling by threats, voters who desire to exer cise the right of free suffrage. 3. Holding in fear of their lives officers appointed by law to certify the list of rep resentatives and officers prima laeie enti tled to seats and commissions. 4. Disregarding two proclamations of the President commanding the same ille gal organization to desist from acts of domestic violence. These allegations will, if proven to the satisfaction of Congress, form a basis lor such intervention as will, by new election or otherwise, assure to Louisia na a repub lican form of government. We will only comment upon the third al legation in the above category. The Return ing Board is beset by astute attorneys and beleaguered by armed bands ambushed, in the ordinary occupations of society, but ready to execute the orders of their chiefs. The attorneys for the White League hourly admonish the Returning Board what they may do. The organs of the White League daily inform the board what it must do. The penalty of failure to obey these or ders is to be a repetition of the violence of the fourteenth of September. The Returning Board is not permitted to act on its own construction of the law. It is not allowed to do acts identical with thoso performed by a preceding board, composed of members of the present White League. One example will be given: The board proposes to suspend considera tion of the vote of Sabine parish. The polls show a Democratic vote of 841, and a Republican vote of *2. The table of population shows in 1870—whites, 4592; colored, 1847. Taking one voter to every five souls as a rule, this would give a wliito vote of 918, and a colored Vote of 369. Certainly there should have been more than two colored voters, disposed to vote, among 1847 persons. It would be unreasonable to assert that the colored voters in Sabine voted with the whites, because the whole Vote of the whites is short of the white strength. It is 841 out of 918. Now what will the public think when informed that a Returning Board ot 1872, composed of some of the present White Leaguers, made the following just ruling in regard to the parish of Jefferson: There were 555 Fusion tickets, and not a single Republican ticket, while it was known to lie a Republican district. * * We thought it conclusive evidence ot fraud, and did not count them. This honorable decision Was good law in l'sT J. when declared by a Fusion Re turning Board. If the Returning Board should now exclude the whole vole of Sabine, because *1 is absurd to suppose that but two persons voted Out of some thing lest* than two thousand, they are threatened vith a condign and infamous death. We will not repeat the examples her?' tofore given of the discrepancy between the White League altornejs anil the deci sions of the Fusion Returning Board of 1872. Kuongh has been shown to prove the existence in Louisiana of an illegal combination which tends to the overthrow of republican government by means ille gal aul unknown to the constitution of the federal or Mtate governments. If this illegal combination choose to take the violation of law into their own hands, defeat the will of the voters and overthrow the State government, their triumph will scarcely exceed in duration that of the fourteenth to seventeenth of September. A ease will have been con mmmated in which an outride and illegal force will have nullified the law; and Con gre«, upon a formal finding of the facts, and the application of the State authori ties, will be reqnired to guarantee a repub lican form of government to Louisiana.

POLITICAL REMEDY. We publish in another column a letter Charles A. DeRudio, lieutenant Seventh Cavalry, United States army. It is a re markable historical document, and will bring again to the notice of Europe a revolutionist who had forfeited his life to the power he attempted to overthrow, now holding an honorable commission ander the government of the United States. To ns it comes as a most oppor tune illustration of the principle dis- - cussed in these columus. Has the citizen of a republic a right to overthrow by per sonal assassination or other violence the government which he had engaged to support ? Lieutenant DeRudio, an Italian sub ject, lias based the justification of an at tempt to overthrow an imperial govern ment in France on two grounds: 1. That Napoleon III. had attempted to intervene in the political affairs of Lieutenant De Radio's then country, Italy. 2. That Napoleon being, according to Lieutenant DeRudio's belief a usurper, tyrant and oppressor, stood as host's humani generis, and might as lawfully have been killed by any person as any other pirate. Lieu tenant DeRudio assumes, therefore, that himself and associates took upon them selves this duty of executing a common obligation of humanity, and that they stand upon similar pedestals before pos terity with the slayers of Ciesar, Holo fernes and Gessner. This reasoning is very much the same with that employed by our alien instructors of the Bee. It is in both cases fallacious because inappli cable. If Mr. DeRudio had been a sub ject of a government based on force, his right to change by force a form of gov ernment not of his choice would liav e been undoubted. In such case he would have had the same right. to overthrow a government of force by force, as had either of the heroic types of hiscory. His right to go out on a general mission of killing the oppressors of other nations can scarcely be justified by any improper intervention of a foreign oppression in the affairs of his (DeRudio's) own country. But assuming that he had been the sub ject of a form of government not of his choice we repeat that he as a subject would undoubtedly have had a right to change that form of government by any revolutionary act. Captain John Smith, the founder of an American colony, was captured somewhere in Transylvania. He is depicted in the books in irons, with his head shaven, the slave of the Turk. Captain John beat out the brains of bis master and fled on bis horse. In this John Smith was n® party to this labor contract, and he terminated it in the shortest and most effectual manner pos sible, nor has any publicist ever question ed his right or criticised his aet. Personally, we would prefer to any act of revolutionary violence an assemblage of the people, with an exposition of the reasons which justified the proposed change, the levy aud organization of troops with some fiscal system that would relieve the necessity of living by spoils of the army on free quarters of our own people. This rather than the poignard, or poison or explosives. The customs of nations, however, differ, and in admitting the principle of individual or associate right to overthrow any form of govern ment not the choice of the subject, we leave the fashion of means to national usage. Where we prefer Runnymede and Magna Charta Lieutenant DeRudio would perhaps choose a bomb and fuse, while a French communist would possibly resort to petroleum. Wo excuse, therefore, Messrs. DeRudio and the Bee man, be cause of the total difference between the Neapolitan and Parisian reasoning and the remedies of our own. Lieutenant DeRudio has of his own free choice renounced allegiance to nil other countries and become a citizen of the United States. Would ho assassinate the Preside nt of the United States, even if he personally thought as badly of him as he has done of Napoleon? He could not logically do so, because be, as as citi zen of the republic, bas agreed that if any question of legal construction, public policy or official conduct shall arise, he will not settle it according to his personal opinion on the merits by a bombshell or a stiletto, but will resort to the tribunals offended, according to bis own agreement, or to the electoral means of effecting a change of public agents, as provided for by the constitution. The whole difference between the moral obligations of Mr. DeRudio, the subject of a government of force, and Mr. DeRudio the citizen of a republic, lies just in this. The subject may right himself by per. sonal means, the citizen must right him self by the means which the law has pro vided and pointed out to him. Mr. DeRudio will thus see that his illustration of his right to assassinate, predicated Upon the invasion of the United States by some oppressive conqueror, has no appli cation. Meu would have revolutionary rights of violence under a government to which they were not parties, which they w ould not have under a republicau and representative constitution. There has been but one assassination in our federal history- that of Mr. Lincoln. It was perpetrated by one who acknowl edged the dastardly character of the deed by flying. It would have been wholly unpardonable even as an act of war. The whole nation and the whole , Kouth hastened to denounce the aet as a horrible crime. It affords no precedent. We express no opinion of the justification of Mr. DeRndio's act. It was a Euro, peau act in a European country, com. mitted under circumstances which w-e can not appreciate, because we are citizens of a republic with legal remedies, not sub jects of a despotism under which there are no legal remedies. The reputation of Lieutenant DeRudio a- a good cilizea and a good soldier, the indorsement of eminent men in other countries, and the entire exoneration from the charge of having abased his acci dental power over the citizen of a free country, warrants us in extending entire confidence to his "irreproachable Euro pean career." _ THE TAX ON 

LABOR. If it be a grievance, as President Grant truly shows it to be, to compel a man who has earned a dollar to accept ninety cents for it, what must we call that system in New- Orleans which offers to labor no more than thirty per cent of the ninety per cent thus excepted to? The President contends that the money used for the payment of laborers should be of full value, incapable of depreciation and exigible for all transactions between man kind in which balances are adjusted in cash. New Orleans bas its full share of bard money men, who let their sympathies go cut in a strong, full current for the poor factory men, the railroad laborers and all, aud singular who are compelled to take greenbacks for pay instead of specie. At the same time they give the employes of their own city and State the option be tween State warrants worth, perhaps, fifty cents in paper on the dollar, or in city time, worth about thirty-five or forty cents in the same currency. Yet our hard money men, who applaud the President and revere the memory of Old Bullion think anything is good enough for our policemeh school teachers, city and State employes, and public creditors of all kinds. Specie payment is vastly too valuable a principle to be wasted upon the common herd at home. It is well enough to introduce it into transactions between landlord and tenant, perhaps, where the latter do all the paying, but it should never be carried so far as to those between masters and servants. Our hard money men have one currency for the poor and another for themselves, though it looks well in them to approve more liberal sentiments in the President's message. A very large part of the labor of New Orleans pays not only the ten per cent difference between gold and greenbacks, bnt the more appalliDg difference be tween greenbacks and what they receive. Poor people have been compelled to suffer a shave as high as seventy per cent. In the meantime enormous quantities of the most productive real estate in tho city pay no taxes whatever. The Council is about to move on their works, notwith standing the feeble attempt of the Mayo», who is no doubt s bard money' man, to stay proceedings. Our half starved, over taxed laborers are crying for current money of any sort, soft or hard, while those who so wickedly withhold it feel none of the privations so familiar to pov erty. The signs are favorable for a change in public sentiment upon this question, and when that comes it will not need an honest journal to point out those who will be distressed by enforcing exact justice. The Returning Board is now very near the close of its labors. The members will therefore soon cease to be the target for political abuse and the objects of the small fry bullying that bas been the staple stock in trade of the White League jour nals. With their retirement our sensation mongers will be threatened with want of employment. Having been in the busi ness of abusing somebody so long it is believed their machinery is not adapted to any other kind ot work. There will be little or no canvassing of votes hereafter. The duties of the board will be to deliberate upon the questions which have already been argued before them and illustrated by such testimony as was attainable. As there will be no special need for counsel, perhaps the meeting» will be more private than those heretofore held. There is a remarkable subsidence of bluster, now that the days of this well abused tribunal have drawn so near to a close. To an outsider it would go far to strengthen any suspicions that may have been formed that there has been an unsuccessful attempt made at bluffing. A
