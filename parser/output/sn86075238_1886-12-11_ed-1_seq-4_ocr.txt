He covers the whole field. It nearly clogs t the wires with its transmission to the press throughout the country. He congratulates the United States that she is at peace with all the other na tions of the earth, reiterates his re commendations upon the fisheries o question and hopes that congress will C utake immediate action pointing to the settlement of all piscatorial difficulties. tl n He again urges the re-establishment '- of the boundary line between British d America and Alaska. takes up the sub- tc 0 ject of our Mexican relations and asks o0 for a better treaty for navigation and commerce. He sustains Secretary Bayard's position in the Cutting af fair. He recommends a revision of the extradition laws be so amended so that the surplus be relegated to the ci people, cheapening the price of the to necessities of life and giving free en- b< trance to such imported materials as p, by American labor may be nianufac- it tured into marketable commodities. di He again, earnestly recommends the r suspension of the coinage of silver. After suggesting some improvements a in the judiciary system he reverts to c the Indian question. He says that r the agency system is inadequate to I the requirements of the Indian Serv- Ib ice and wisely recommends the aboli- si ation of tribal relations and the allot- w Y ment of their lands in severalty. He ti thinks that all acts relating to the w taking up of public lands be repealed IY except the homestead and insists that Si e the laws against the fencing of public lands shall be strictly enforced. He u urges arbitration as the proper meth- o od of settling;difficulties between cap- Mt ital and labor. He asks congress to lip do something to stop the ravages of sa s pieuro-pneumonia and winds up by Ij 1 endorsing Civil Service reform. THE 

SPORTSMAN'S PARADISE. th - - - to. To the lover of our-door diversions G F Great Falls and vicinity offers an in- T t viting field. Within a short day's ci ride the sparkling nIountain brooks Pi i abound in the choicest specimens of I the finny tribe, while both large and small game yet tempt the hunter with promises of reward which are sure to be :fulfilled. Several bands of w antelope lurk upon the outskirts of h, the townsite within shot of which the \i sly hunter may come any day. The F drives about the town are all varied w and exceedingly interesting. h The smooth surface of Broadwater bay which quietly washes the eastern border of the town, allures the boat- ti ma.a, who, with skiff or sail- tt boat can pursue his pleasant w voyage up the picturesque Missouri for many miles. He will not cast his line there in vain, for large white fish, cat-fish, grayling and trout. We i' a believe that this will be a great resort 12 for summer tourists who will not suf- n fer from ennui though they prolong , s their stay througout the summer and F Y fall season. There are innumerable s, places of interest to visit and no s end of healthful diversions. One of tl these days some of the broad, level b acres about here will be laid out for c a fairground and race-track, for Mon- e tanians are proverbially fond of con testing the honors of the turf with horses of noble blood. THE CITIZEN'S DUTY. In almost every town there are cer tain individuals who are on hand to a get all they can out ofthe community " e without contributing anything them e selves. Public spirit is-an element ij s foreign to their character. We are, p thus far, very fortunate in Great Falls ii e in this respect. There are few if any, f - of our citizens who hang back when r" called upon to contribute to any good t work. It should be firmly held in 1 mind that money, time and exertion expended for churches, schools, librar ies and other publicinstitutionsis not a taxation upon what the contributor never enjoys. Whatever adds to the elevation of character and promotes proper industries, redounds to the benefit of each and every atom of the corporate body. of W. $.

Id --o Jumped tne Gang. Bf- rTTE, Nov. 7th.- Frank Ramage, an of inmate of the jail wh, was working out d a fifty dollar fine on the road a day or two since, found himself suddenly with no e custodian but a dense fog. and concluded ae to itinerate, which he did, and has not 1- been seen since. If he will leave the city as permanently the city will con,:ratulate c- itself, for he is a notoriucis an chronic s. drunkard. W, W. Dixon's House Burglarized. r. s 3'UTTE, Dec. 7th.- --The residence of to ilon. W. W. Dixon was surreptitiously at entered last night and burglary attempted. at Things in the house were well pawd over. to Itis plated ware was tested as to solidity, - but none was thken. Mr. Dixon's solid i- silver not being accessible to the thieves, t- was not stolen. The burglars made an en Ie trance and exit through the transom, ae which was removed, and that was the on ?d ly thing missing. Si Sherinfs Sale of the Big- Slaughter ic House. e n Thursd:ay afternoon Sherlif Savage sold tne entire plant and property of the i)-- Miles City Dressed Beef Company at pub o lic auction for the sucm of '2,5.870. The of sale was made under an execution on the ty judgmer~ which was confessed by the company in favor of the Lincoln (I11l.) banking house of Win. DUtstin & Co., and the purchaser was W. II. Ross, Esq., trus tee of the Lincoln Bank and the Stock is Growers National bank of Miles City. a- The amount of the sale represents the 's claims of those two institutions and at the is present writing they, through their true. tee, have possession of the plant in lieu of their claims.--Yelllowstone Journal. Deep Creek Dance. cr On the evening of December 17, a dance - will be given at the Deep creek school *t house for the benefit of the school fund. A Mr. Evans, who favored us with a call '¶ Friday, states that the school is provided with a good teacher, Mr. Remington and has about fifteen scholars in attendance. no There are forty-one children in the dis trict. It is to be hoped that there will be a good attendance, as all will have a good time and contribute their money to a wor thy cause. The Great Falls string band t will furnish the music. Fire! Firell Firell! Next Tuesday evening at Wetzel's store in the Stone block, there will be a mass meeting of citizens interested in the organ ization of a Fire Department. We do not need to urge tipon any sane man who is in anyway pecuniarily interested in Great SFalls, the necessity of at once providing 8 some means of stopping the spread of fires o which are liable to break [out anytime in f this town. A hook and ladder truck would 1 be the most practical purchase which r could be made now; and then have it man- a ed with certain reliable men who under stand the business and will attend to it when the time for action arrives. In a fa vorable wind a tipped-over lamp or a va grant burning match might sweep this townsite as clean as it was when Paris Gib - first looked upon it four years ago. t, w is the time.to take hold of this mat tr in earnest. Fire protection here will o alo reduce the enormous premiums which Y we are all compelled to pay to keep our property insured. Let's go at this matter ýt in a business-like manner and sensibly , provide a means of preventing our build bs ings from being transported to Heaven in r, freight wagons of fire. a The columns of the holiday edition of d the
