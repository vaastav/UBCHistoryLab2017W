A people whose liberality is proverbial, and whose cause never suffered for lack of financial aid, m*e now confronted by the unpleasant ifaet that their brilliant, tried and hon orable leader is now patiently ana man fully combatting one of the most power ful combinations ever organized against -An Irish leader in a British court of in nstice. The significance of the litiga tion between Mr. Parnell and the Lon don Time cannot possibly be overesti jy.aled. With Mr. Parnell and the holy cause which he represents, this is in deed a crisis. Its final result svill no doubt have a marked effect upon the movement to which Mr. Parnell has de voted the energies of his splendid man dvood. To is is certainly an emergency, one which again appeals to the lib erality of patriotic Irishmen every where. The cause of Mr. Parneii has beei such as to commend him to the Intelligent aud fair-minded people of America. It is particularly fortunate aud significant that here in the north west this movement to defend Mr. Par ••aeli was inaugurated by a purely .American source. With these facts be fore 'diem the Irish-American people of Minneapolis can certainly be depended MUOU to do their whole duty. It is the xlesire of the genera!, committee that Monday's meeting be not only a grand success financially,but that the spontan eity with which the Irish heart string rushed to this last call maybe made manifest in a general outpouring of our Irish-Americau citizens.'' A large number of circular invitations have been sent out to Americans throughout the city, requesting their presence on that occasion.

SIGNS OF A COMING- STfiTJGGLE. All over Europe there are signs of ap prehension at the present time. In these times of peace war preparations are going on upon a most extensive scale. In every capital and at every council board the work of preparing and calculating for war that seems to be in evitable, is, to aay the least, receiving vast attention. For almost twenty years the coming of a great contest be tween the armed hosts of Europe has been foreseen as the result of an un bearable situation, and state has armed against state and bayonet been added unto bayonet until the Continent of Europe has become a gigantic armed camp, It is not probable that such a state of things can endure. Loans can not always be raised, and it is lust as certain that commerce and prosperity are bound to decrease in proportion as the number of soldiers are increased. The richest exchequer is soon eaten away by the maintenance of great armies. Indications point strong to the fact that we have about reached the moment when, by what seems almost a tacit agreement amongst the nations, the result of twenty years of'prepara tion are on the eve of being tested. If war were to break out now it is almost certain that the contest would be at first between Germany, Austria aud Italy on one side—with Frauce and Russia on the other. What the result of such a contest would be it is not easy to foretell. The strain has further been aggrava ted by the recent issuing and raising in France of another ioan for llussia ot £20,000,000. This cannot be endured much longer. Furthermore, the fact that Salisbury deems it of more than ordinary necessity to make additions to both the Engiiih army and navy which he refused to endorse not many months ago, gives a pretty fair idea as to his estimate of the present situation. There are certainly good grounds for belief that a European war is near at hand THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. In his message to Congress last Tues day, president Cleveland called partic- now exist from a hteh protective tariff, we give that part of the message which bears oirectly upon the tariff. The farmer and laborer will find meat in these reflections of the President "The grievance of those not included with the circle of these beneficiaries, when fully realized, will surely arouse irritation and discontent. Oar farm ers, long-suffering and patient, strug gling in the race of life with the hard est and most unremitting toil, will not fail to see, in spite of misrepresenta tions aiid misleading fallacies, that they are obliged to accept such prices for their products as are fixed in foriegn markets, where they compete with the farmers of the world that their lands are declining in value while their debts increase and that, without compensa ting favor, they are forced by the action of the government to pay, tor the bene fit of others, such enhanced prices for the things they need that the scanty returns of their labor fail to furni3b their support or leave no margin for ac cumulation. Our workingmen, en franchised from all delusions and no longer frightened by the cry that their wages are endangered by a just revi sion of our tariff laws, will reasonably demand, through such reyision, stead ier employment, cheaper means of liv ing in their homes, freedom for them selves and their children from the chain ef perpetual servitude, and an open door to their advancement, beyond the limits of a laboring class. Others of our citizens, whose comforts and ex penditures are measured by moderate salaries and fixed incomes, will insist upon the fairness and justice of cheap ening the cost of necessaries for them selves and their families. When, to the selfishness of the beneficiaries of unjust discrimination under our laws, there shall be added the discontent of those who suffer from such discrimina tion, we will realize the fact that the beneficient purposes of our government, depenndent upon, the patriotism and contentment of our people, are endan gered. Communism is a hateful thing, and a menace to peace and organized govern ment. But the communism of com bined wealth and capital, the outgrowth of overweening cupidity and selfishness, which insidiously undermines! the jus tice and integrity of free institutions, is as dangerous as the communism of oppressed poverty and toil, which, ex asperated bv injustice and discontent, attacks with wild disorder the citadel of rule. He mocks the people who proposes that the government shall protect the rich, and that they in turn will care for the laboring people. Any intermedia try between the people and their gov ernment, or the least delegation of the care and protection the government owes to the humblest citizen in the land, makes the boast of tree institu tions a glittering delusion and the pre tended boon of American citizenship a shameless imposition. A just and sensible reyision of our tariff laws should be made for the re lief of those of our countrymen who suffer under present conditions. a revision should receive the support of all who love that justice and equality due to American citizenship of all who realize that that in this justice and equality our government .finds its erength and its power to protept the J' 7 THE 

IRISH STANDARD citizen and his property of all who be lieve that the contented competence and comfort of many accord better with the spirit of our institutions than colos sal fortunes unfairly gathered in the handa- of a few of all who appreciate that the forbearance and fraternity among our people which recognize the value of every American interest are the surest guaranty of our national pro gress, and of all who desire to see the products of American skill and ingen uity in eyery market of the world, with a resulting restoration of American commerce. The necessity of thereduc tiou of our revenue is so apparent as to be generally conceded but the means by which this end shall be accomplished, and the sum of direct benefit which shall result to our citizens present a controversy of the utmost importance. There should be no scheme accepted as satisfactory by which the burdens of the people are only apparently removed. Extravagant appropriations of public money, «rith all their demoralizing con sequences, should not be tolerated either as a means of relieving the treasury of its present surplus or as furnishing pretexts for resisting a prop er reduction in tariff latea*. Existing evils and injustice should be honestly recognized, boldly met, and effectively remedied. There should be no cessa tion of the struggle until a plan is per fected fair and conservative toward ex isting industries, but which will reduce the cost to consumers of the necessaries of life, while it provides for our manu facturers the advantage of freer raw materials and permits no injury to the interests of American labor. The cause for which the battle is waged is comprised within lines clearly and dis tinctly defined. It should never be compromised. It is the people's cause." 

EDITORIAL BREVITIES, TIIE new Holy Rosary church, Twen ty-fourth street and Eighteenth avenue south, will be dedicated to-morrow. "WHY was Harrison elected asks Walter Blaine, in an article to one of the December Magazines. An early answer is expected from Matt Quay, who handled the boodle. EVERY reasonable Northern .Repub lican ought to be satisfied with plund ering the South through the high tariff. Why should the enormous thefts of carpet-bag rule be restored? IT is explained in connection with the marriage of a Dakota couple (the groom is twenty-four and the bride sey enty-five) that the bride gaye her hus band $500 and promised to leaye him her entire fortune when she dies. THE estimated expenses of the Times in putting its case before the Parnell commission is $21,000 per day, and it is said that its total, bill, by the time the trial is ended, will run upwards of one million pounds sterling. FRITZ GJSLLERTJP'Sanarchistic teach ings will reap its reward. The young scholars, for instance, if they are dOli gent in their studies and. learn their lessons well, will have a splendid op portunity in future time to be '"dropped" by the hangman. COUNT Herbert Bismarck, the most rising man of the day in European diplomacy, is the only new representa tive of statecraft who bears a scar re ceived battle. H8 was shot through the thigh in the cavalry charge at Mars la Tour, in which he rode as a private dragoon. SIR Francis Clare Ford, who is men tioned as the probable successor to Lord Saekville at Washington, has had a long diplomatic career.. Since Febru ary, 1878, he has been the British Min ister at Madrid. He is a Knight Grand Cross of St, Michael and St. George, and a Companion of the Bath. THE contest for the parliamentary seat of Holborn, London, has resulted in the election of Mr. Bruce, the Con servative candidate, by 4.398 votes against 3,-133 for Lord Compton, the Gladstonian. At the last election the Conservative majority was 1,501. The Liberal gain is therefore 536. which, even in defeat, is very gratifying. THE total Presidential vote in the United States was 352,062.in 1S2-1 1, 410,772 in 1860 and 10,056,447 in 1884. It is altogether probable that the total vote this year has increased to nearly 11,000,000. These figures, indicating the growth of the country, are almost bewildering. Since 1860 the papulation has more than doubled. WE cannot understand, says the Can adian Freeman, how some Catholics can not Such conscientiously take a paper and pay for it. We know a few who took the Freeman, and after enjoying its contents for a year or two years sent it back, refusing to pay for it. We have their names and they might as well put their hands into our pockets and abstract therefrom the seyeral amounts in hard cash. None of our Catholic papers are patronized equal to their merit. In the defence of Catholic truth, they earn more than they can ever receive. All have their days of embarassment and trouble from the want of common honesty on the part of this very "delinquent'' class. Instead of encouraging their dishonest inclina tion, these fellows should be denounced and exposed. They are the incubus and the curse of the, Catholic press of the couptry Lt\ \iy«ft if i*y1 1 6 L_ I ty,- i, -V 'cM v. .TURDAY, DECEMBER THE American farmer is the only one in the world who would vote to mort gage his own farm and tax himself that hemightdoit.

In the meantime, let us reft rm the tariff, in crease our foreign trade, and develop the abundance of territory which we already possess. LIGE HALFORD,President Harrison's secretary, is an Englishman. He is a Methodist and something of and ex horter. in his early career as a journ alist he distinguished himself as a re porter of executions in Indiana. George Harding conferred upon him the title of "Banter Around the Gallows," which he bore with honor for many years. THE Parnell commission adjourned Friday uutil January 15. At Wednes day's session several witnesses testified to various cases of boycotting and out rages. On cross-examination they said that they knew people who had written themselves threatening letters, They also admitted that the National League denounced outrages. THE Democratic veterans ought long ago to have left the G. A. E. The Re publican press rarely, if ever, recog nizes that a large part of the Union army was Democratic, and everything achieved by Democratic soldiei'3 has been credited to the Republican party. The G. A. R. is now merely a Republi can machine, and is of nobenefio to the country whatever. BEING asked to announce from his pulpit a lecture by an ''escaped nun," Rev. W. II. Thomas, a Methodist min ister of Worcester, Mass., thus replied: "I am not in harmony with the un christian un-American, discourteous assault upon the Roman Catholic Church, now so popular about Boston. I am endeavoring to educate my people to higher things, and must decline to read your notice." IT will interest many of oui readers to know that the Sponge, tinged with Blood, used at Our Lord's Crucifixion, is still preserved at Rome, in the Church of fct. John Later an, with much vener ation. While the malefactor hung upon the cross it was customary, by meaus of a sponge, to apply vinegar to his wounds, that by its astringent qual ities it might in some degree staunch the blood, and thus prolong the suffer ings of the victim. PERHAPS no message since the days of Washington has commanded so much attention as that of President Cleve land's, read before Congress last. Mon day, and it is certaiulv the equal of any document of its kind heretofore given to the American public. In his cool, characteristic and conscientious way he makes an earnest plea of what he considers the people's cause, aod he does so in that plain, straightforward manner that he who runs may clearly understand his meaning. There is no mistaking the fact that it is a most perfect and timely arraignment of abuses existing in our governmental policy, and the bold and earnest tone of the message from beginning to the ciose marks President Cleveland as one of the most faithful and sincere public servants America has ever been blessed with. THE National Indemnity Fund, says the Dublin Freeman's Journal of No vember 24, now amounts to close on £191,000. The progress of the Fund has been most satisfactory. About .£2,000 a week have poured in in response to the call made by the Freeman's Journal, and the sum now stands at the splendid figure named. Of course, the amount is not nearly what will be required to meet the very heavy expeoses of Mr. Parnell and his party in their now his toric trial but we have no misgivings that whatever amount shall be required will be subscribed. Yery manv of the branches of the National League in Great. Britain have not yet sent in th^jgr contributions, although we perceive from the reports publised in our col umns very respectable amounts have been subscribed. In America, too., we perceive by exchanges to hand local subscriptions are being organized in the United States and Canada.

How to shine in society—Wear the same dress coat year afrer year. An envelope is like a woman. It can't go anywhere without address. A good constitution is like a money bos, its full value is never known till it is broken. The lady whose blood curdled in her veins has ever since been very sour in her disposition.

A country paper says that a young lady was recently discharged from one of the largest pickle factories in that neighborhood because she was so sweet she took the acid out of all the vinegar.

We have all been proud of the Min nesota Loan and Trust company as a home institution and of its building, and bave admired the conservatism of its management, and the excellent character of its Board of Directors and Officers. The company's business is divided into four departments. The first department is that of mort gage loans. These loans are made with money obtained from the East by the company at low rates. This Company has already procured aud loaned in our State, and largely in this city and St. Paul, over ten millions of dollars, of which not one dollar has been lost. Many of our people are coming to find that they cannot do better with surplus funds than to have them loaned upon so excellent a class of security as this Company requires. The Company keeps on hand a stock .of excellent first mortgages, to be assigned to those whe desire 3uch securities. The second department, is the Trust department, which is devoted to the care of estates, the execution of wills and the guardianship of minors' as well as the becoming of Trustee of bonded indebtedness. The late Governor Washburn showed his wisdom by mak ing a Trust company the Trustee of his estate. Trust companies are very much preferable to individual Execu tors and Trustees. Baing a corpora tion their life is perpetual, and they dc not die and leave the trust in strange hands while theirJ large capital and surplus makes them absolutely respon sible. The third department is the money deposit department. Five per cent per annum is allowed in this department upon deposits remaining six months This is as liberal a rate as our Saving? Banks can allow to a depositor, and he has the added advantage of a large capital and surplus for his increased protection. Trust companies havo been useful, because very safe, in this par ticular branch of their business. The fourth department is the Safe. Deposit and Storage Yaults which are the finest in the Northwest. They are built by the most famous manufactur ers, and after the most approved methods. The Company has not only fitted up safe vaults, but convenient waiting and coupon rooms, etc., and all these are at the service of the renter of a small safe, lor the small sum of five dollars per year. This affords to people in moderate circumstances absolute safety and protection for their valuable papers, and other valuables. That these safe deposit and storage vaults are appreciated, is shown by the fact that more than 1500 of our citizens have availed themselves ot the use of them.
