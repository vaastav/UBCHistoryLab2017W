IVure-; of this sort speak volumes for the piv-penty of the new South. Mr. Mills, it seems, listened with interest tc h.' president's message when it was read to tin House, and he seems to havi been at nit tho only congressman who did so. As it was largely an echo of his own opinions mi 1 statements, the Texas statesman was naturally impressed. Secretary Kndicott suggests in his report tint bv means of a generous supply of um mi mt ion for target practice to colleges win n nriny ollleers are serving as instruc tors, it is possible that competitive contests in rifle-shooting might, in time, becomo as popular with some of these inland collegc us boat-racing now is ut tho universities ol our seaboard.

Krone Is Murphy, the great temperance advocate, estimates that

The National Despatch Control Vermont fast line has lowered its rates from New York to Chicago on through business to thirtv five cents on first-class, twenty-eight rents on second, twenty-six cents on third, twenty-four cents on fourth, twenty cents on lifth, and twenty rentsonsixtb.

The astronomers taking observations of the last transit of Venus have finished their calculations und announce that the earth is only !I2,;!S5,000 miles liom the sun, which is ii.OOO.OOO miles less than the distance hero totoie fixed by the astioiiomers.

This is the ono department of the government in which almost every person In tho country is directly interested and It needs anil doubt less will have a thorough overhauling under the new administration. An Ottawa despatch says tint a deputa tion is urging the government to Impose an os-poi t duty on all hunloel; lugs for the Am erican nulls in order to protect Canadian In dustry and insure the expenditure In Can ada or capital at present in est til in the United States. As no duty can be imposed without the consent of Parliament, no im mediate change of duty can be expected. The recent fncrease of the export duty on pine loc, it is added, is chocking exporta tlnns to the United States. The democratic New York World takes no stock in Postlunstoi-Uencrnl Dickinson's dec laration in his report that the postal service under this administration has greatly im proved. "It would ih'light us to think so," says the W'mlil. "but we are constrained to ltelievo that th" postolllee department has been demoralized under Mr. Dickinson and that it is not as good as it was four years ago. Skilled and trained men have been displaced to make room lor men appointed on account of politics solely. How could that improve the sonlce?" The compt roller of the currency recom mends in his annual repoit that the out standing United States nots or greenbacks (amounting to about ;?:r0,000,000 be ttmd ed into bonds bearing interest at ! percent to be Used as the basis of a national bank note circulation, the banks to allowed to issue notes to the par value of the bonds, in stead of !)0 p"r rent us at, present. Here ports the nnniberof national banks in opera tion to be 111 10, a net. increase of 00 during the year; but the note circulation has suf fered a net decrease of !?17,000,000. At the laying of the corner-stone of the great new public library building, which the city of Boston has began to build, on Wed nesday, tho orator ot the occasion, Mr. I'rince. stated that tho Boston public library was tho first in the world to allow its books to circulate among the people. Before that in all libraries, hi re and abroad, readers were restricted to the use of the books in the rooms and cloisters of tho library buildings. Tho Boston library inaugurated the practice of allowing renders to take books to their homes. This is certainly something to boast of. The harmless find succulent oyster is the cause of a war in Maryland. The bivalve is the foundation rock of an immense industry in that State, the beds in the Chesapeake ag gregating 12;i..V.!O,l00 acres. From them over 10,000,000 bushels of oysters are taken every year, yielding wages to the extent of fl, 000,000. Th'Tc are nearly a thousand oyster vessels owned in Maryland, and their crews number between 1000 and 0000 armed men. These men have combined to pursue their calling wherever they may think it profitable whether they are authorized to dredge there or not. The Stato has sent out fourteen vessels with about 100 men to op pose them mid has thus far been worsted in the tight. The governor is thinking ot bringing some howitzers into service and there are prospis'ts of lively times ahead. The "White Cap,'' are organized bands somewhat similar in their methods to the ICu Klux of former years, which, undertake to administer lynch law in Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. One of the latest in ts was the brutal whipping of a poor shoo maker of Sardinia, Ohio, who was suspected aiiough not convicted) of stealing wood to kci p his wile nnd children warm. In the face of his protestations ot innocence ho was dragged from bis bed and lashed with heavy black snake" whips by six White Caps, while nearlv tlfty more looked on. The whips brought blood at eery stroke. Finally the tortured man was dwigged back to his cabin, thrown on the floor, and has inco becomo a laving mnni.ic. The liilli iins who thus take the law into their own hands should be made to foel its lull penal ties. The law of this Stato relating to steam heating on the railroads, enacted at the late session of the Legislature, provides that ut ter December 1, no passenger, mail or Imgago cars other than on mixed trains, halMiM heated by any method or healer un less such fiiruacH or heater shall llrst have been approved by thn Board of llailroad ( 'oniniianioiHTs. Nothing in tlie act is to au thoiiye th" commissioners to prohibit tho heaitng of cars by steam from the engine. nother law reipiires railroad companies to '. ep for wile at principal stations mileage tickets in the 1'orui of coupon books, which shall contain Aot more than 1000 roupous, good lor nil" iiiile uirli and be good for members of a family or llrm named on the book. Another relating to market days provides that all roads shall give to all sta tions equal acroiiimodalious ami facilities as to market day in- market day rates. The methods used to disfranehiso republi can voters In the Southern States vary In different localities, according to the circuni-stnu'-es und emergencies of the vaiious cases or according to tho whims of the democratic managers. In siiiro places the colored republicans are intimidated, in others cheated out of their votes. In many places they vote as they choose; but the ollleial returns ! ar no relation whatever to the true count. In Florida, according to a a corri'spondent ot tho Boston Ti-ttn tlev, a faoi'itr method is to doctor tho voting lists. Hesas tluit at Waldo in that State the names of many republicans were left oil' tho list ol voters, that at Ncuniaiisvilleforty-twonanies wore left oil', most of tin in of men who had been voters for years ; mid that at Orange Heights, witli less than 100 voters, the names of seventisn republicans wero left oil' tho list, while one democrat, who was not registered, was allowed to vote, and the United States supervisor was delleil and run out of town. Iteports ot similar doings come from all parts, of the State, and he says it is not doubted that oven with the mini bcr disfranchised, the vote of Florida, faiily counted, would show a republican plurality. There Is at least one branch of the govern ment service which is of necessity kept aloof liniii politics. It is the llfu-snvlng service. Tlio report, of the general superintendent of the service has just been jssued, There wero "s!'i stations in commission at the closo of the last llseal year, and the figures famished from these stations are interesting.

Tho ('land Army not n Uollllenl Ol giiiii.nt ion. The recent retirement of Hen. John M. l'ahncr of Illinois from thn (irand Army of the Republic on the ground that ho considers it to bea political organization, has created no little hue and cry in the democratic pa pers, it has been asserted th.it many other prominent soldiers, of democratic alllliatious, were about to billow lien. I aimer's exam ple, nnd flint an extensive rival organiza tion would be formed out of tho ex-members of the (Irand Army. Most of all this is .sensational. (irand Army men smile at the idea of a split of their order into two 1 todies, one consisting of republicans and the other of democrats, anil it is as plain as anything luture can be, that nothing of the sort will huppen. As to General Palmer's charge of parti sanship, brought against the (!. A. 11., it is effectively disposed of by Judge W, (1. Vea zey. ina letter to the Rutland rj-cftf, which we copy in another column. Having recently held the oflice of judge advocate general ol the order, Judge Vea.ey has been in a position to know exactly what he was talking about, and his denial of the charge is supported by a very effective array of official orders and of fncts. Commenting on his letter the Herald pertinently sajs : Judge Ilea owed his election as conunaii-der-in-chief to the tact that he was on the bench and therefore out of (lolitics, and the members wished to avoid even the appear ance of political partisanship. Judge Vcaey himself was strongly supported at the last national encampment for commander-in-chief on the same ground, not less than for his recognized ability and hjs brilliant l coord as a soldier. And Major Warner was elect ed not less because of previous pledges than becau.se he expre.-sly stated that he had de clined to be a candidate for re-election to Congiess and would therefore soon be out of politics. This is all so. "The Herald adds : This is the record of the Orand Army and of prom inent republicans in it. What is the demo cratic record ' Those members who are now complaining went to Columbus and did all they could to elect Gen. Sloeumcommander in chief, although ho had never been a very active and prominent (irand Army man. The object evidently was to get the great, organization into demo'-ratic hands during tlie campaign. President Cleveland oven wrote the conimander-iii-cliief a courteous letter of regret that he could not attend the meeting, when in fact he had not been in- ited, as indeed lie could not be, not being a inmibrr.'' No doubt party sympnthy nnd scheming had something to do with tho pushing ot lien. Slocuni as a candidate for grand com mander. Tlie help which the schemers hoped for, however, from his election was probably more ngntivo then positive. They could hardly have supposed it to bo possible to capture the Grand Army and turn it in to a democratic campaign club ; nor could they have darod face tho storm which such an attempt would have raised. There is no need to add a word to Col. Vouzcy's letter ; and we have only to say that it any of our readers have surmised that there might bo ground for Gen. Pal mer's charge, we trust that they will read, mark and inwardly dlftestlhiseU'cetive answer to it. Tho Now Insane Asylum. One or two Vermont papers say that tho legislature appropriated $100,000 for tho cri'ctiiin of a new insane asylum to be lo- eutid at Hutlaud. There is no foundation for the hitter assertion. Tho Legislature appointed a board of special commissioners, and placed the sum named at their disjiosal lor the care of the pauper and criminal In sane ot our State, with authority to estab lish a new State asylum, if in their disciflion they deem it to be wise, but no location for such an asylum was fixed In the bill, nyr indicated in tho discussion. Tho bill, in fact, moused little discussion and wus Mindly passed in tlie House, without opposition, though with less thun n score of votes in its favor. That something must 1? soon dono for in ereusod accommodation for the insane pau pers was plain. Tim iisyhini at Brattleboro which it is to bo remembered is a private institution, not under the control of the State, has of Into been overcrowded. It has been enlarged Ironi time to time till it has capacity to properly accommodate 100 patients. For the past two yours, tho aver age uuihIkt of its patl"ut has been 401. Its ollleers do not think it wise, to further en largo its buildings. In former years they havo opposed tho creation of a separate State asylum. Now they favor tlieestabllshinentof suclian asylum. They say in theirlnst i eport : "At the rate ol iucreiiso of the number of insano paupers and criminals which has been going on, betore the expiration of nil other biennial period some process of oxclu sion may bo forced upon us. We urge upon the Legislature tho consideration of till question." homo legishuion like that enacted was thus a necessity, Under tho bill the cover nor and commissioners havo large dlstretion- ary powers. Among these will I mi tho locaU ing of thn new nsyhuu, and various places. Burlington among tho muulr, w ill no doubt bo duly considered by them before coming to n iluul decision. The Signal Si'i-vh'c, The failure of tlie weather bureau at. Washington to predict the storm of last ,wool which caused so m.iny fearful disaster on the coast has called forth severe criticism. Many pooplo apparently will bo sat Islled with nothing l"ss than a com plete wiping out of the whole system. But granting that, the predictions of the bureau are not ns reliable as they used to bo and might be it does not follow it would bo wise to abolish thu signal bureau. There is such a thing as the science of meteorology, Imperfectly developed though it lie, as the previous work ol tho signal ollico has de monstrated. What seems to bo needed is a thoiougli reorganization. At present the absurd requirement that observer. shall first enlist In tho army as common soldiers keeps out of the service tho scientific men who might make it u success. The removal of this bar might tend to bring about another dcsirnhln change, viz., an increase in the number of observing stations. How would it work if the weather bureau were transfeired from tho war de partment, where it has no proper place, to the agricultural dcpattineiit, tho most ex pert meteorologists obtainable placed at, its head, and the subordinate positions filled with men who know as much about weather as the average New England farmer. The result would probably 1m a much more efficient ser ice. Such a change certainly could not make it any less reliable than it is at present. Tho I'rrsldrnt's Mcsar-. Mr. Cleveland's swan-song will be read with interest, though it was not awaited with especial anxiety, The president, as well as the people generally, is down on tho "trusts"; but these will be less dangerous when tlm republican party, with its recog nized opposition to trusts nnd monopolies, regains control and lakes them in hand. He is still alarmed about the sur plus. Ho has not altered his views upon the tariff, and insists with labored iteration that protection benellts only the few, while it lays unnecessary burdens on tho "toiling masses," Tho experience of the past year has evidently given Mr. Cleveland no new light on this subject. To many of his pro positions with reference, to these economic subjirts no exception can be taken. Some of them are self-evident platitudes; others show the obstinate unwillingness of Mr. Cleveland to modify views which he has once expressed. His opinions, however, are now of less consequence than they would be if ho were to remain many months longer at ashmgtoii. If his friends will join the re publican in the House in passing thu Senate tariff bill which will soon be sent to them, tho surplus will soon cease to trouble anybody: the revenue will bo re duced ; anil the tariff will be revised in the interests of industry nnd of tho toiling masses. Mr. Cleveland hns nothing new to offer in regard to the fisheries dispute. His allusion to the Sackville-West episode shows indications of the irritation which the British minister's disclosure of his opinion that tho president's letaliatiou message was simply a campaign document not unnatur ally amused. The other passages of the messago contain little of especial interest, and our dispatches indicate that it created no especial sensation in Washington. The Annual lioport of (ho Interior Drpni'tineiit. Three subjects treated by Mr, Vilas, in his annual report as secretary of the in terior, are of general interest. In tho public land ollico an extraordinary amount of busi ness was transacted. Besides the public land patented lor mining and railroad pur poses, etc., patents were issued during tho year tor an agricultural area estimated to ex ceed 7.."00,000 acres an increase of 11,000, ('00 acres over the j ear preceding. During tho last eight years 1 -12, 11.1,2 18 acres have been sold. This is a territory as largo as Germany or France, twice as large as Great Britain und Ireland, and equal in extent to tho New England and middle States, In respect to Indian affairs Mr. Vilas says that "although progress is not rapid, still the transformation of tlie Indian character and habits is steadily progressing." He makes plea for a more comprehensive system of Indian schools, and expresses the cou iclion that "the capacity of the lndia-i for civilized education is little, if any, behind that of many peop'o whom our institutions do not reject, and iwrhaps in udvanco of some of them ; and the promise lor the production of a Useful and trusty manhood as the fruit of such educa tion is correspondingly satisfactory." Ho thinks that the government should provide instruction for all Indians of teachable age, and estimates their number nt 10,00(1. At present theie are 11.000 Indian pupils in schools provided tor or aided by the govern ment, anil" the uvcrugo cost per pupil is !?102, which would make the annual cost of instructing all the Indiaus about 1,000,000 per year. More than half of all these pupils, however, are in boarding schools, where they have to bo maintained as well us taught. The average cost, per pupil ill the day schools is a little over 12(1 .per annum. The Indians have the advan tage of industrial training, for which five government schools nro maintained, with an average attendance of B!S8 pupils, and in addition, 47tf pupils are sent to the Normal training school, at Hampton, and the Lin coln institute. The disbursements of thu pension bureau were larger than over, tho amount paid out during th year amounting to .7H,77.",8(11,02, which, when added to the cost of conducting the business of the pen sion bureau, makes a total of $S2,()i!S,:N).59 or about one third of the total expenditures of the government. Our nation is certainly not an ungrateful one. Arrested Under an Assumed Xante. From the Messenger. One Georgo Walters, who was wanted at Lowell, Mass., for burglary and highway robbery, was arrested at St. Albans on Monday by Officer Kelley, mid taken back Tuesday by a Lowell officer, to whom the news of tho capture had been telegraphed. Officer Kelley rcceiwd a description of his man a short time ago, and succeedis! In working up the case to n successful issue. Wallers was found to have lut-ii living hero under the name of "Georgo Harrington,'1 and wns braking on tho road.

The prospects for a large and successful poultry show under tlie auspices of the Champlaiu Valley Poultry association at City Hall December l'l to 13 in clusive are very encouiging. Half fare rates on all the railroads and the Chateaiigay have been secured and a large number ot poultry fanciers have expressed their intention of making exhibits. A com mittee is canvassing tho city for the sale of membership tickets and ns this is tlie only form in which our business men will be nsked to contribute to the financial suc cess of the exhibition, it is hoped that a large sale may be eff ected.
