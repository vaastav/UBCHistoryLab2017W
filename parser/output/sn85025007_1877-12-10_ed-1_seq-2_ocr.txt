Albert Taylor Bledsoe, whoss death is aDDouooed elsewhere io to-iay's Gazette, was bora in Frankfort, Kentucky, November 9, 1809. When about twelve or fourteen years of ago bis remarkable mechanical ingenuity, io seeing through and imitating a puzzle, attracted the attention of Governor Letcher, of Kentucky, who said : "This boy shall have a cadet9hip at West Point." In his sixteenth year he went to the Military Academy through the itflueDce of the Governor. He graduated there in 1830, and for a year or two he seived io the army as Secood Lieutenant, io the irregular frontier warfare with tho Indians. At the expiration of the time due from oadets to the United Slates service, he began to read law, wbioh was his chosen profession, io tho office of his uncle, Mr, Samuel Taylor, of Richmond. In 1834 ho took the Assistant Professorship of Mathematics at Keoyoo College, Gambier, 0., where he also studied Theology, and io 1835 he was ordained to the ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church, He then took a parish io Hamilton, Ohio, and at the same time the Professorship of Mathematics in Miami University. Io 1836 he was married, and in 1837 went to Lexiogtoo, Ky., where he became the Assistaot to tho present Senior Bishop of the Episcopal nnoatinn * h Hiia f i m rt OrrtSiO VUUlUUt UULUU l|U^3llVUt UV Hiio \IIXIW! %??vwv in bis mind, iu regard to the teachings of tbe Prayer Book oo the subject of Baptismal lie generation, which fioally ioduced him to resign the ministry. Ho then offered himself to the authorities of the Methodist Church, but was refused admittance on account of somo views, which did not quite acoord with the belief of that denomination. Through his whole life his views, though always iodepeodeot, were i nearer those of the Methodist Church than of any other. i Leaving the ministry he began the practice of law in Carrollton, III., and afterwards carried it on in the Supremo Court of Illinois,at Spring- ' field, ood for a short time in tho Supreme Court at Washington. Io 1845 he published uAn Examination of ( President Edward's Inquiry into the Freedom of the Will," which has been for many years out of print. Iu J848 he applied for and ob- ! tained tbe Professorship of Mathematics io the University of Mississippi. Ia 1853 ho published bis "Theodicy,or Vindication of the Divine Glory, os Manifested in tho Constitution and Government of the Moral World," which, after beiog rijscted as a Rife by several ot tho most astute publishers in the United States on account of the unpopularity of the subjeot, went through three editious of 1,000 each, in four months. Subsequently many other editions were called for and printed. Io 1854 he accepted tbe "Professorship of Mathematics in tbe Uoiversity of Virginia. Whilo there, io 1857, he wrote his "Liberty nod Slavery." After tho completion of the volume he was smitten with brain fever, and lay for several weeks, hoveriog between life aod death. When the war broke out he entered the army . as Colooe! iD the Confederate service, but Presi- < dent Davis, sayiDg that be wanted the service of his brain, rather than of his hand, appoint- i ed him Assistant Secretary of War. He served about eighteen months, bearing, for much of tho time, the entire responsibility of the Department, in consequeooo of tho ill health of his superior officer. During this time ho retained the possession of his mathematical pro 1 fessorship. In 1863 he resigned on acoouut of impaired health and wont to London in order to pursue i his studies of the Constitution of tho United j States. He returned in 1865, aod soon afterwards published (in 1866) his book, "Is Davis a Traitor, or was Secession a Constitutional Right Previous to tho War of' 1861 ?" Io , 1865 he wrote "Tho Philosophy of Mathemat- j ics," completing it io the space of three weeks, and 80oo after published it, and io tho same year he began tho publication of "The Southern J Review," Baltimore, Md., to the editorial du- ( ties of which ho has devoted himself since that ' time. From the time that he loft tho ministry of tho Episcopal Church he romaioea a lay mem ber until 1871,when ho began occasional preaching in tho Methodist Church, and soon after 1 wards became a member and then a preacher 1 of that denomination. In that samo year the x Southern Review was accepted by tbe General : Conference of the M. E. Church, South, as its organ, though it always expressed the views 1 of tho editor himself, and was never subject to j any supervision from outside. I On the 7th of November he felt the oncom- j ing of tbe illness, whioh soon prostrated him, and his first wordson coming home were, "My j timeisoome." Without a tremor at the thought a of death, but with an unspeakable horror of ? outliving his mental powers, ho lay dowo, to die. In a very few days all care, anxiety a and dread fell away from bim, and be lived on I with only sweet thoughts and pleasant fancies v flitting across his mental vision, till he sunk into a calm and gentle sleep,whioh lasted almost w uninterruptedly till he breathed his last at eleven 8] o'clock Saturday night, December 8th. % sl Dr. Bledsoe was one of tho most vigorous (] thinkers of the age, and being firmly oonvinoed u of the oorreoiness of hie own opinions, was dis- h tinguished for the boldness with which ho an- ^ oounoed and supported them. He possessed ^ great natural mental powers, whioh bad been p assiduously cultivated, and was a rapid and industrious writer. Ho was truly an able man, {c mod the wo d of Letters has lost one of its D, brightest stars. h AXEXAIsTDiRIi Legislative.?lo the State Senate, on Sat | urday, Messrs. Queseobeny and Johnson were excused from serving upon corumi'lees?the former from the Committee ou ll)ads aud Lu teroal Navigation, and the latter from the Com mittee on Courts of Justice. The Chair stated that he did the best he could ia the appdut mcot of the committees, and had the approval of his owd conscience, and therefore would not have aoy feeling at the ac'ioo of individual Senators. A committee on re apportionment was appointed, ana u number of unimportant bills and resolutions presented a ad referred. *" " ,?r.rnml,l . l>ir.

The resolution, pro posing a reduction of 20 per coot, io the salaries of all offioers in the State, including members of the Legislature, was debated, but laid over till to day. Mr. Brooke's res lutiou for the appointment of a j )iot commi t^; on rovi sion of the criminal laws, to consist <f five on the part of the Senate and uinc ou the part of the House, was agreed to. Io tho House of Delegates, a resolution was adopted for the appointment of a j )iat commit tee, to whom all propositions for amendments to the Constitution aQ.l such measures as arc referred to in the Governor's message be re ferrcd. A committee on the part of the House oo reapportionment was appointed. Mr. Mushbach, of Alexandria, introduced a bill to amend tho act of March 27, 1870, sess. acts 1S75?*76, page ICS. The till iu relation to the use of convicts iu the repair of the James lliver aod Kanawha canal was discussed aud advauccd to a second reading. The time for the use of the convicts was limited to Deonmber 1, 1879. Probabilities point more and more, as Prcsi* dent Hayes's term is proceeding uninterruptedly on its course, to General Grant as the radical Domincc for the succession. Every act of the present Cungress that may result disastrously to the interests of the country, whether the democrats be solely responsible for ic or not, will strengthen this probably ; and, that there may bu some such acts, the radical support certain democratic measures receive, occasions forebodings by no means unwarrantable. Then, too, notwithstanding the denials to the contrary, Cscsarism was Dot kided when Mr. Hayes was nominated. There are thousands of people all over the country who are tired of this form of government?some who ore rien uuu want iu secure their posscs.-ions, and think that end can be accomplished by a mi;i:ary goveromoor, ai d 9ome who arc poor, whose condition may be improved, but cannot be injured by any change ?and both will favor a third term to General Grant, as a means of efTeoliog that change. With such a lookout, the true lovers of the country should be ou their guard, and democratic legislators, State ut;d National, be careful to do nothing that will Lend to still further low er free institutions in public estimation. They are low enough now in conscience ; any further reduction would bring them to the condition of absurdity. The members of the Virginia Legislature may have enjoyed their "sport" last Satutday Dight, but they certainly could not have realized I he fact that they were uiakiotr a foot ball of the credit of the State, acd itjtiring the reputation of the people they represent. If readjustment be the sioe qua non of prolonged State cxistcuce, let it at iea*t ho accomplished decently and in order. It will be seen that Mr. Eustis was, to-day, admiitnd to his seat in the Senate by a vote of 49 to 8. This increases the democratic strength in that body.

J oho Goode represents the second, or Mir folk district. His seat in ihe last House was ooutestcd by Piatt, a somiwhat noted em pi tbagm r, but, by a close Vote, Mr. Goodc retained his place. In the subsequent election lw was opposed by Joseph Segar, who threatened to coutt st Mr. G '9 right to a seat in this Hou-e, hut failed to carry out his intention. Mr. Goode is an able politician, an energetic repre seotative, watchful of the interests of hi" ci?n stiiuiuts, and a fiuc speaker, always command iug the ear of the House. Permitting the us of his name as an opponent ol Mr. ll?ndail for Speaker was the gravest mistake of his Congressionaljoarcer, indeed, about the only ot.c he has made. Wis jaid ambition ?and Mr. (J. must plead guilty to the soft impeachment? spurred him on, added to the importunities of Morrison, Sayle-r, Blackburn, and a few others, but in this butane ambiiion overleaped itself and fell on tother side, carrying wall it all save one of his colleagues from Virginia. So fat no opposition has developed itself, and Mr. G. may have a walk over the course nix time. The third, or Riohmond disiriet, was in the last, and is iu this House, represented by (J 11bcrt Carlton Walker, who, as above stated, declines another term, though injustice to him it um-i bo said that he has lost nothing of his great popularity.

Wise, of Richmond, though it is said by those who profess to kuow that a candidate will ho Si'leotod from the rural portion ef* the district. Joseph Jorgenson, of Pennsylvania, and an assistant surgeon in the U. 8. Army during the war, and who alighted in Prince Piward county, represents the leurth or Black district, io the House. lie is seldom seen, scl dum heard of, and will no doubt be omitted next time. Col. W. E. Hiotoo, Gen. iMahcne, Mr. Berkeley aod others are mentioned a.J.hc conservative candidate, and there is not much doubt tbat a conservative will represent the district io the next House. George C. Cabell, of Danville, is the renre seniative from the filth district in the present House, as he was in the last. Col. Cabell is a relative of the Breckeuridges, and presses a strong family resemblance, hut apparently Pcks the vigor if intellect so conspicuous iu his kns ineD. lie la very jmuc uat in Pis attend .nee upon the sittings ol the House, hut has, so far, taken no part io the debates, and it is Dot known that he i t a speaker.

John Randolph Tucker, locked uj.oo as one of the be?t Constitutional lawyers iu the State or country, a strict constructionist of the st?ict est sect, aod a man of uedoubod ability, represents the sixth or Lexington district in the iiousj. The 8cDate would be a more appropriate f'oruoo for tbc display of bis talcnis.? Notwithstanding bis legal lore aod scknoivlcrig cd genius, he has not made the display autici pated, and lately has been very quiet. Hiultra State's rights views make him a target in the House for the shafts of the republic ins.? Mr. Tucker will have decided opposition for ro election, aod the Hon.

He is said to be the greatest electiooecrcr in Virginia, never allowing his contests to puriurb his personal rclatioos. Notwithsandirg he will, it is said, have decided opposition, sjujo of the most distinguished men in the district being spoken of. Augusta, Shenandoah and Rockingham counties will each present a oandidatc, aDd Mr. H.'s reiuro is problematical. The Alexandria district, the eighth, is represented, for the third term in the House, by Gen. Eppa Iiunton, who during the la>t session acquired a deserved reputation by his > xpusure of lilaioe.

S.?Senator Wood bas iu troduced a bill in the Senate that is of interest to lawyers and sheriffs throughout the State. The bill provides lor the amendment of the Code of'73 r.o that in a criminal case in a eir ciiir, county, or corporation court, if qualified jurors uot exempt Iroui serving cannot be coo vcLiuutly found in the county or c >rporauoD in which the (rial is to be, the court mr.y cause so maoy as may he necessary of such jururs to he tULutuoood lroto aoy other cjuoty or corpora ticij by tho sheriff or sergeant thereof, or by its owu officer. Every juror so summoned will be paid one dollar per day he attends and same mileage as witness in a civil case. 1 suppose this hill will meet with tho approbation of criminal lawyers, especially when they are for the d? fence. The (Lin mitten for Courts of Justice has i' in hand. Hi-re was quiie an exciting scene io Ihe caucus called by i he read j utters to night. Gen. Andir.-on, <f Richmond; Senator Smith, of Nei-oi ; (Je11, Taliaferro, of Gloucester, and oth-.us who were net in the first caucus of re adjusters were prescuf, and Unir presence did net meet with the approval of Mr. Barbour, Mr Moffat and other read jitters whose idea of r-aiijus; incut is different from that of the other wing. The eousi qucnoe wa?, that aft-r :i stormy scene and words between Mr. II. I J.

They organized in secret session in the old billiard room at the Exchange Hotel. Mr. Fulkeison. of Washing too, was elected permanent chairman, aud Messrs. McCau'-l, of Pulaski, and liobio'-oo, of Portsmouth, .secretaries As this latter wing was the "Simon pure" readjustment element, us Mr. HarrRoo called it. ihi-ir meeting ha-i created somo excitement. Mr. Eu.kersou, in l-is speech accepting the nomination of chair mao, delivirod sentiments that eiioired ap plausc. lie denounced the Funding bill, and Slid that the State credit had already been dis honored bv repeated promises to pay and noi paying. What was demanded dow was tc make our ricoipts pay the expenses, and without increase of taxes. The session was secret, and only in em h-.-rs of the legislature who were vouchtd for by Messrs. Barbour, Muffett and other well known ring leaders were admitted. It, was decided by the caucus not to go into the election of State offic-rs at pres-nt. This iodi nates that other candidates will bo brought out. The caii-us ?i I pmbibly held auothtr meeting tifxt woi'k. Neither Delegates Hunter n rMushbach were in the caucus. There wore between seventy five and eighty gentlemen in attendance on this caucus, which included Messrs. Smith, of Diowiddie; Curiett, of Lancaster; Mr. Mar-fit1, and Robert Nurton (the last named delegate colored), all elected as repubicaDS. Ross II ;milton, Peter Carter and two othci * 1 i * i /i _ i i i_ colored delegates remaioca at tnc uapuoi wun the meeting presided over by Senator Smith, and participated in that meeting. So, as I predicted in my last letter, the republicans arc pretty evenly divided oo the readjustment question?although everybody is for readjust moot one w-;y or the other. At the mcetinc presided over by Mr. Smith ho offered resolu< tions, upon which r.o action was taken, depreoatmg repudiation, but favoring honorable re adju.-oujeur.
