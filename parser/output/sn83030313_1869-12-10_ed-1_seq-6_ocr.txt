But anybody can call upon CongrenR. : If the League is in earned It will try to do I wiuethuur more. matter* in Cengrew?l*?ertttBt Bilto '? Proapecb The session of Congress opens with very business-like purpose. It would appear to be fully appreciated in the Senate and the House that while the general growth of the country and the great elasticity of our institutions promise to carry us not only through the troubles left over by the war, but onward to a wealth and prosperity that were never dreamed of before the war, there are still many points in which our progress may be facilitated and furthoreil bv timely legislation. Perhaps there may be room for several opinions on this point, and it may especially bo doubted whether it is not wiser to leave alone the Improvement that we see and foci in our political troubles, as well as the immediate promise of our finances. These are the two points that are to have the honors of the session, from appearance. Sev eral financial propositions havo already been made and reconstruction Is to come on the carpet without delay. Mr. Morrell, of Pennsylvania, presents in the House a bill to fund the debt and make bank ing free. He proposes to fund the debt in a new loan beapng three and two-third3 per cent interest, retiring first that part of the debt that bears cois interest, and last the legal tender notes, making it compulsory upon the national banks to convert the basis of their circulation at once or go into liquidation. But the more immediately important proposition <>1 his bill is that for the repeal of the clause in the banking law which limits their circulation to throe hundred million dollars. Ho proposes to make banking once more free, only requiring banks to organiza under the national law, and to deposit bonds as a security for their issues. This appears to be the latest shape assumed by the agitation lor more currency. Hitherto different parts of the country and different interests clamored that they were cratupod in their operations by the scarcity of money, and the demand was only that the Secretary should expand in the limit of his discretion. Now it is proposed to make this matter onco more absolutely free, so that business shall regulate itself, and ono section shall not be sacrificed and another assisted in the interest of a financial policy. In theory this is very attractive, lor the simple name of free banking seems to put the matter quite in consonance with all our American ideas. It also seems quito satisfactory that the circulation is to be, as now, assured by national obligations; but the loss of the bills to a holder is not the greatest danger the people have to apprehend from banks. We see here a proposition that may put the coun try, even to a graator degroc than it now is, in the hands of banks, and wo are not without our fancy that theso will after all prove to bo the very banks that control us now, subject to a limitation of their power. Tho limitation ot the national batik circulation has always b?en held to be one of tho wisest points iu the banking law, aftd the legal tender currency our best currency, and we do. not see that we shall get an equivalent in giving up that currency and taking away that restriction. In fact, it seems to us that this is the very proposition that the banks would themselves make to enlarge and consolidate their power, for, having the field already, thfy, of course, would apprehend nothing from tho name of "free banking." An important bill on reconstruction is fore shadowed in the words of General Butler to aomo Virginia gentlemen, "Congress will compel Georgia 40 keep her plighted faith." Georgia, it will bo remombored, adopted a con stitution as "republican in form" as the most extreme radical could desire, giving the colored man all political rights, Ac., and on so doing was readmitted to the Union. Once in the Union, and feeling her dignity as a sov ereign State?over the local affairs of which, under "the constitution as it was," Congress could have no control?Georgia quietly kicked the colored man down from his high pedestal and declare J that ho should not sit in the Legis lature. In all this, as we hav e 3aid, she acted under the constitution as it was, forgetting in the new constitution the ever teeming words as to "appropriate legislation." These words give Congress as absolute a power over thi3 matter in Georgia as it could have in the Dis trict of Columbia, and no doubt tho power will be asserted in all its force. These are the words of the fourteenth amendment:?"No State shall make or < nf >rce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. * * * Con gress shall have power to enforce by appro priate legislation the provisions of tliis arti cle."* By the adoption of an amendment with these words the States have in effect vacated their sovereignty as to all the subjects Uiat can be brought under that amendment, since for all such subjects Congress is the su preme law-makiug power. What is to bo done in the case of Georgia may give to the States at large some light as to the practical possible operation of the amend ment Ia addition to these important topics we notice two propositions already up for com plete amnesty; an inquiry from stanch old Cameron as to Cuba, and a hint from the Census Committeo that the legitimate suc cessor of the slavery agitation is to be an agitation as to railroads. Among tbc moat important matters which were brought to the attention of the Senate yesterday mast bn enu merated a communication from the Governor of South Carolina, enclosing resolutions of the Legislature of that State relative to the recog nition of Cuba as an independent government; a memorial in fivor of according belligerent right! to Cuba; the necessity of the publica tion of a new map of the United States illustrative of the land resources of the country, to be made in connection with tho report of the Commission r of the General Land Office; a resolution by Mr. Sumner aiming at suoh legislation ns nhall secure for medical practitioners in the District of Columbia equal right" and opportunities, without distinct ion. of color, and a report from the Committee on tho Judiciary of the bill re lating to tho appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, with an amendment in tho nature of a substitute. The llotirfo of Repre sentatives was mainly occupied with a discus sion as to the most economical mode of taking the census. Evidently wo are to have a ses sion of very great interfst to the people, and if, as rumored, it is to be short, it umuI, per force. be very practical. The Council of the Vatican Opened. The Council of the Vatican, to long looked forward to, is now one of the great facts of tho hour. It has been opened. There has been aoine show. There were immense crowds in the streets. The bells rang. St. Angelo and Mount Aventine thundered. The Holy Father in fino health headed tho procession. Ex ternally all went merry as a marriago bell. But where wore the princes who did honor to the Council of Nice, the Council of Con stance and the Council of Trent? They were all conspicuous by their absence. There was no one to represent Constantino or Sigismund or Charles V. Tho absence of official repre sentatives of the governments of Europo more than anything else reveals tho weakness of Popory. The Popedom must to-day feel humbled. It now knows that it has no longer any hold on the kingdoms of this world. The Council of Trent was a crucial Council. So also is this of tho Vatican. The Council of Trent had to sorrow over tho loss of the half of Kuropo. The Council of the Vatican has had to sorrow over tho Iosb of all civil govern ments. Church and State iB doomed as an old system. Tho Council of tho Vatican is as purely ecclesiastical as our Episcopal convoca tions, our Lutheran synods, our Methodist conventions, our Presbyterian assemblies. It is a big thing, but it is no more than a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical assembly. Now that tho gathoring has taken place it is not out of place to ask, What will this Council do ? Wo cannot well answer. This, however, we can say, that so far as any one knows, either inside or outside tho Catholic Church, it is in tended to impose upon mankind by giving the sanction of Heaven to the Syllabus, the As sumption of tho Virgin and tho Infallibility of the Pope. On tho face of this programme absurdity is written. Greater absurdity is not conceivable. If tho Pope and his triends can not see this, the Pope, his friends and tho Catholic Church which they represent must suffer. Light, however, has often come out of darkness. Dark, therefore, as this dark ness is, it does not forbid us to hope for light. So Election Returns?How Do Tlicoo Things Ilnppen ? Tho Charter election has passed off. Cand' ? dites have gone through the ordeal of a can vnss. A set of them hava boon declared duly elected. Others who were in the field have been "counted out," as they allege. But with the close of tho po!ls on Tuesday last there has not been the usual finale to the interest and excitement of tho contest. IIow is this It arises from tho fact that most shameless and outrageous frauds were committed at tho polling places?that tho Charter election of 1S09 was in reality a saturnalia for partisan zeal and barefaced fraud, committed within and without the ballot box. Repeaters not only did their work effectually in suppressing and overruling the wishes and predilections of tho citizens as they desired to express them through tho ballot box in favor of tho candidates of their choice, but inspectors and canvassers lent their aid or co^ntcnanco to the cheat and to the outrage by "stuffing" and "counting out." Tho evils of our election system cry for ira mediate redress. They wero never so appa I rent as in the late election. In this connection tho Commhsaionera of Polico come in for large share of tho blame and opprobriu attaching to the manner of voting and the linal result of Tuesday^ election. The Clerk of the Common Council reports that in no less than sixty-two election districts the canvassers appointed by the Police Commissioners had failed, up to yesterday, in sending in their returns of the vote cast in their respective districts. ThiB fact alone makes a burlesque of the | election, and no candidate can be legally de clared elected under such circumstances. No wonder, then, that the greatest excitement prevails in political circles, and that the result of the election is canvas3ed und speculated upon from one end of tho city to the other. If this state of things is not remedied at once any election in this city is merely a delusion, a mockery and a snare. Our Central anil South Ainerienn Corres pondence. To-day we present our readers with a budget of correspondence from the Central and South American republics. Taken on the whole the news received is good. From Nicaragua wo learn lhat the war which has continued there for some years has been brought to a close. In Venezuela law and order have also been re stored. From South America we hear of the arrest of Morales by the Peruvian authorities on the charge of violating the neutrality of Peru. Morales had given out his intention of marching into Bolivian territory and there stir ring np a revolution. Tho prompt action of the Prefect of the Peruvian province of Puno in arresting the chief conspirator put a damper on the Insurrectionary desires of thoso who sympathized with Morales. Our letter from Lima refers to an unpleasant occurrence which took place in that city during the early part of last month, in which the officers of the United States mca-ol'-war thcu in port and the Peru vian authorities play the principal parts. Much feeling is expressed in ralation to the matter, and the particulars of tho affair have been forwarded to tho Navy Department at Washington. The political campaign in Chile for the elections to take place^arly next year is quite active. Thorn is au absence of politi cal disturbances notice&ble in all quarters?a tact worthy of record. The Soman and tiie Viceroy.?In connec tion with tha news by ocean telegram announc ing that tho Viceroy has yielded to the ulti matum of the Sultan and accepted all tho con ditions which it imposes, we reproduce the arguments on which the Viceroy bns'vl his previous resistance and also the text of tho isuitan's ultimatum. It will be seen that for the present, at least, the submission of the Viceroy to vassalage must be complete. Removing Disabilities.?CongresH practi cally offerb a premium for the adoption of the flllocnth amendment by proposing that upon iln Hnal adoption all diiabilitics shall ce&ce. This would bo a good proposition if it were not op<*n to the suspicion of an intention to influence the adoption of tho amendment. That is a false basis for legislation. Senator Ferry's proposition for (he complete abolition of all tost oath? Is much better. It la only i uecnseitrv to make It a little broader. Ptogre? of the Wtawa'* Bl|kM Horrible ItonWitH. Conventicles and meetings of the women'! rights women are increasing East and West, and they are widening the sphere of their dis cussions from women's rights in the matter of suffrage to "everything in heaven above, in the earth below and in the waters under the earth." But at the Woman's National Suffrage Asso ciation meeting in this city on Wednesday evening last the McFarland-Richardson tragedy, with all its shocking details and teachings, was the engrossing subject of the evening's debates and resolutions. Mrs. Norton led off in a resolution against the manufacturing of public opinion in behalf of an assassin, declaring that "had Sickles and Cole both suffered the just punishment of their crimes this (Richardson) murder would never have been committed." Upon this hint a woman's rights man of the freq. love order, named Poole, took up the subject. He con tended that the divorce laws of New York were not free and easy enough; that the death bed marriage of Riohardson and Mrs. McFar-* land upon that Indiana divorce was a glorious thing, though in defiance of the laws of New York; that women are loaded down with laws, and ho objected to a}l laws affecting women because they are women, and so on. Next pame Mrs. Blake, who, having a husband of her own, did not admire^ these lax divorce laws of the Western Slates. In France during the Reign of Terror, when the divorce lawB wore relaxed, a woman could not go to a public assemblage without seeing six or eight different husbauds, and Mrs. Blake didn't want anything of that kind. Mrs. Norton, for her part, thought that a state of things which allowed a woman six or eight husl^nds was much better than the order of society under which a poop woman was obliged to live with a husband she detested. This, surely, was "speaking right out in meeting." Mrs. Summerby, horrified, no doubt, at Mrs. Norton's ideas of women's rights, suggested that the real question before the society was woman's right to the ballot. A certain Dr. Hoeber here put in his oar, contending that women's rights in matrimony were dependent upon their possession of the right of suffrage. In the deplorable fact that none of the newspapers had come forth to the defence of Mrs. McFarland you could see how women are treated. In fact,' ho pronounced our present system of marriage as nothing but prostitution. Mrs. Norton backed up this free love doctor, and contended that the question of suffrage and the question of the divorce laws were mother and child. This simply means that the ultimatum of these woman suffrage associations is free love and easy divorces. This, then, as" the upshot of woman suf frage, is the entertainment to which the Ameri can people arc invited?free love and free and easy divorces?comprehending the abolition of the family, and the substitution of the Fourierite phalanx or the juvenile asylum for the children of the community. What a horrible mesa of darkness, diabolism and chaos, to be sure! In the face of such impudent and startling revelations from these free love men in petticoats and these old women in breeches, and in view of their atrocious designs upon society, McFar land will be apt to be considered the avenger of an outraged community, rather than an offender against its laws. Indeed, with a few more of these outspoken free love women's rights meetings on the Richardson assassina tion it will bo impossible to obtain a jury on the case. The Lecture: of Pehe IIyaointiie.?The Academy of Music was never more densely thronged than it was last evening; on the occa sion of Pi-re Ilyacinthe's first, and perhaps only, public appearance in America as an orator. Never have the walls of the Academy resounded to loftier or more im passioned eloquence. Pere Hyacinthe spoke from the heart to the heart. This was the secret of the prodigious power with which he swayed at will the emotions of the vast audience before him. If many but imperfectly understood the language in which he spoke, none could be insensible to the magnetism exercised by his beaming counte nance, by the music of his voice (veiled as it was by the effects of a slight cold) and by his superb action. A single phrase in bis lec ture?le cceur, c'cst Tliomme?an infinite im provement on Button's famous phrase?le style, c'e&l Vhomme?would suffice to make it memorable. We present elsewhere a report of Pfcre Hyacinthe's lecture, which must have yielded a liberal addition to the funds of the French Benevolent Socicty. Two Views.?Prom Paris and from London we receive simultaneously two views on Ameri can finance, set forth by great organs of opinioo in those cities. Apropos to our Trea sury roport, the Paris Siecle says:?"An Ameri can promise is equivalent to its fulfilment." Apropos to the same roport, the London Time* growls out a remembrance of State repudia tion, and mumbles a fear that we shall never pay. The financial man of the Time* will never forgive us for oitr success in putting down tli2 rebellion. An Expensive Economy.?On the New Jersey Railroad a conductor put a passenger off the train for the want of twenty-five cents to pay his fare; and now the company pays to the man's widow?killed by that expulsion? five thousand dollars. No doubt the conduc tor's severity was forced by the regulations of the company. There is probably some rule by which in such cases tho passenger's fare, if he were allowed to remain in the cars, would be deducted from the conductor's pay. The com pany now finds how much that sort of severe economy costs. State Jttaim seem likely to come up in Kentucky onco more, and in a shapo in which it will be hard to get them out of the way wilhout going near to the decision that there are no States. It is a question of taxation. Tho power to lay taxes is tho first necessity of the existence of government; that is it:) most vital function, and ono in which it must be absolutely free. This general principle is no doubt the basis of tho decision just given in Louisville, that it is unconstitutional for C011 gr> H8 to declaro that States shall not tax cer tain kinds of property, such as United Statos bonds. Jad?e Cardoso ud "Mart" !*>??? The worat and moat notorious ?vU ^}? c^" sens of New York suffer from at this P'"?8?0* moment Is the unblushing effrontery with wh a certain class of our judges not only inter fere with but actually subvert the course of justice and set aside the sentences of the court for the punishment of crime. The Real case is a real case in point, but not the one wo would here particularly refer to. Mart Allen, a notorious panel thief, charged besides, as all hiB family have been, with divers crimes against society at large, was lately tried be fore Judge Bedford in the Court of General Sessions, and convicted of the mean and con temptible crime of "panel" theft and sentenced to five years in the State Prison. Was Mart Allen conveyed to his place of punishment? No. A facile and accommodating judgo, ia the person of Albert Cardozo, of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, has reversed, or at all events rendered nugatory, the just sentence of Judge Bedford and granted a.wrlt of error In the case. The error is all on the part of Judge Cardozo, as it is in all similar cases where judges who for political reasons interpose the law to screen the violators and contemners of the law. A brother of this same Allen?Wesley?was a short time slnoa sentoncod to Qvo years' imprisonment for detection in his particular line of business? pocket picking?and has escaped. He was seen plying the game of repeating in an up town district on Tuesday last. This is another illustration of the course of conduct pursued by our judges, of which wo have had an example in tho case of Real. So the work goes on, and every condonation of crime for political or other causes but lends treBh incen tives to its commission. The Dalmatian Trouble. It does not appear that Austria has boon completely successful in putting down the insurrection in Dalmatia, as formerly reportod. Dalmatia Is peculiarly situated as an Integral portion of. the Austrian empire. It really has no connection with Austria proper. Whon it was handed over to Austria by the allies in 1814 it was for tho purpose of giving that Power command of tho Adriatic, but Aus tria has lost Venice,' and thus lost her prestige in that sea. This present trouble shows that tho spirit which robbed Austria of Venice ia now vigorously active on tho opposite shore. To rob Austria of Dalmatia would bo but ono other move towards driving her from the Adriatic, and thu3 shutting her out trom tho sea on all sides. Austria will not readily con sent to this. The peculiar formation of tho country makes it next to impossible for her to transport troops by laud. Hcnco her rumored request to tlio great Powers to bo allowed to cross Turkish territory so as to hem In and root out the insurgents. Turkey, as wo know, is not unwilling to grant this favor, for insur rection on her borders is dangerous; but Russia, who is watchful and jealous, will not permit it. The curious thing in tho affair is that Austria charges Prussia with tomenting and keeping alive the rebellion. When we re member, however, that Prince Charles, of Itoumania, is a nephew of King William, and that the disruption of Turkey and Austria is the one thing required to make Prince Charles, wo have no cause to wonder. North Carolina Special Tax Statb Bonds.?The carpet-buggers appear to have got possession of these securities; for wo hear of them in every out-of-the-way nook and corner. A large quantity, it is said, has been gambled away by one of the railway presidents of the unfortunate State of North Carolina. These bonds were issued in aid of existing reads and to build new ones; but, instead of being delivered as was required by the exigencies of the work, were handed by tho bushel basket to officers of the companios, who seem to be having a good time with them. They have sold them down to twenty-seven, and where they will stop remains to bo seen. Had not the State better "stop" before it is too late? Where is the committee of Investiga tion which was coming North to inquire about them ? * liurvftiuaw uiust 

UAIUIU applause sometimes without regard to their moral character; and thia being the case ii must be admitted that the diamond theft just committed at Albany was a noat piece of handi craft. The rogues seem to have had every point of their play rehearsed. The dropping the ring behind the counter, the stooping of the shopman to get it, the flight of the thief with the tray of jowelry, and the prevention of successful pursuit by fastening the door on the outside with an apparatus previously fitted to the premises?all imply study, forethought and a certain genius. Let the merchant console himself with the thought that he was not the victim of burglars. Tite Southern "pacikio Raiumjad.?Gen eral Fremont is at Washington, and it is re ported that his business is to secure the right of way over the public domain for his South ern Pacific Railroad, as provided for in a bill which passed the Houso at the last session, but which still awaits the action of the Senate. As he asks only the right of way we presume there will be no difficulty in getting through the bill. It is reported that the General, dur ing his late sojourn in Paris, waa very buccchs ful in providing the ways and means for the prosecution of tho work. Senator Wii.ma.mh, of Oregon, proposes to settle by legislation tho diilcult point in regard to tho retraction by a Stato.of lis ratification of a constitutional amendment. He moves to declare that when a State has onco given it3 assent to a constitutional amendment any other action of tho same State on that point shall be void. This can accomplish nothing. -Congress has not the necessary power in constitutional law to declare away tho sovereign authority of a State. A Sign in Favor of Ccba?Tho resolution In the Senate of General Cameron, which was adopted, calling upon tho President for such information as lie may have in his possession in reference to tto war in Cuba and tho politi cal condition of the island.
