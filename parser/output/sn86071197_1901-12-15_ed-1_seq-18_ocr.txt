CHINESE EXCLUSION Washington December u Staff Co > impendence There i > no doubt that the majority of the people of this country are very much interested in seeing that some legisla tion looking to the extension of the present Chinese exclusion law is enacted by the present congress A determined oppo sition to such legislation will no doubt develop as soon as the matter is actively taken up but there seems to be good reason to believe that it will be futile so far as the final re sults arc concerned although it may have the effect of de laying action in the premises to some extent The opposition referred to will come principally from the big steamship companies which operate between Pacific ocean points Such companies would derive a large amount of revenue from the flood of immigration which would unques tionably follow the failure of congress to extend the pro isions of the Geary law and it is quite natural that they should regard unfavorably any and all attempts to continue to exclude the celestials In fact at least one of the steam ship companies in question has been seeking to influence members of congress for some time past and there is no doubt that further and more decided attempt along the same line will develop as the session progresses Up to date I the steamship people have confined their work principally i to the sending out of literature to congressmen from all J parts of the country in which arc made arguments in favor j of Chinese immigration and against the extension of the art i which now prohibits such immigration The burden of the aigumrnt s that American labor particularly in the Ha waiian islands is too expensive and that the interests of the capitalists and others interested in various enterprises in those islands would be materially advanced were the bars taken down and the < hinese allowed to come in as they please While particular reference is made to Hawaii it is hinted that the same conditions exist in the United States proper and that the only way to safeguard those individuals and concerns who need the services of many laborers is to make it possible to replace expensive American labor with cheap Chinese labor lie This argument may appeal very forcibly to the capitalists who might save hundreds of thousands of dollars annually if they could secure labor at rates lower than those which are being paid at present it is not likely to be regarded in a particularly favorable manner however by the American workmrn who already believe that they are not as well paid as they should be nor by that portion of the general public which understands and appreciates the conditions of the la boring classes of the country So on the whole no matter how much pressure may be brought to bear by the corpora tions which are seeking to reduce their pay rolls it is not likely that the present congress will fail to extend the exist ing exclusion law and by such failure deny the American workingmen the protection to which they are in every way entitled As a matter of fact it is likely that the people who op pose the proposed legislation have really weakened their case by the efforts which they have made to influence mem bers of congress In fact more than one congressman has been heard to say that the perfectly frank statement of the steamship companies to the effect that Chinese immigration is only desirable because it will enable big corporations of various kinds to secure labor at rates less than are now be ing paid have done more to strengthen the argument for exclusion than to weaken it It seems to be the consensus of opinion here that the literature with which congress men have been favored has been such a plain appesl In favor of the classes against the masses as to destroy whatever hi of thousands of Chinamen in this country would be bad They would brinK from the Orient all the vices for which rtiey are noted They would render this country liable to epidemics of scourges which arc common in their country Except from the standpoint of the man to whom excessively chaep labor is a means to an end the acquisition of great wealth to be used for purely selfish purposes Chinese im migration can not be regarded in any but an unfavorable The present exclusion law expires by limitation on May 5 l9o It is therefore highly necessary that immediate steps be taken to extend the provisions of the act and in this connection it is gratifying to observe that several bills bearing on the subject have already been introduced in the two branches of congress The members who are especially interested in the matter have about decided that the pro visions of the Geary law should be extended by the present congress for a period of two years only The reason for this is found in the treaty with China which was entered into soon after the enactment of the Geary law and which was to cover a period of ten years The life of this treaty which embodied the provisions of the Geary law will extend nearly two years beyond that of the law itself and it is thought that it might be unwise even if not discourteous to the Chinese government to pass an exclusion act which would be binding after the expiration of the treaty If this plan is carried out congress may of course take up the matter two years hence and extend the exclusion for an indefinite period It is understood that the authors of the bills which have already been introduced arc willing to amend them so as to conform with this latest phase of the matter v The bill prepared by the bureau of immigration has been introduced in the house by Representative Kalin of Califor nia and in the senate by Senator Perkins of the same State It is a lengthy document covering over thirtyseven printed pages and it is said by those who have closely scrutinized it to be complete and adequate in every way It provides that no Chinese person or perron of Chinese descent other than such as by birth or naturalization have become citizens of this country or such as arc officials of the Chinese gov ernment teachers students merchants travelers returning laborers etc shall be allowed to enter the United Statos A number of restrictions arc thrown about even the classes which arc excepted and in all of its stipulations the bill is excessively rigid Penalties are providiJ for all violations of the terms of the law and on the whole the matter seems to be covered so thoroughly as to leave little or no room for further amplification or improvement One provision which distasteful the of Pacific is no douht particularly to owners steamship lines is to the effect that all Chinamen ineligible to entry into this country who shall attempt to enter shall after the necessary legal forms arc complied with be returned to China at the expense of the transportation company which brought them hither The bill even goes so far as to direct the secretary of the treasury to obtain a complete list of the officials of China from the government of that country in order that no frauds may be perpetrated by Chinese citizens falsely claiming to be officials In cases where there is an element of doubt a thorough identification is to be required of the person seeking admission The bill introduced in the housp by Representative Cou ncil of Pennsylvania is much simpler than the KahnPerkins bill It piovides that all laws now in force prohibiting and regulating the entry of Chinese into this country shall be con tinued iu force for a period of twenty years after the pas sage of the act The return of all Chinese unlawfully in this country is provided for and it is stipulated that all such persons shall prior to their deportation and subsequent to legal trial and conviction be sentenced to imprisonment with hard labor for a period not exceeding one year All Chinese laborers who are entitled to remain in this country are re quired by the new bill to immediately secure the proper cer tificates A penalty of a maximum fine of iooo and five vears imprisonment is provided for any one found guilty of altering or forging such certificates The other bills introduced do not differ from these in any of their essential features A glance at the census figures shows that the operations of the Geary law have apparently been quite effective In i8qo there were 107000Chinese in the United States while jn iqoo there were only 3000 more or a total of 110000 California contained r 42 of the celestials in 1800 The last census showed only 45745 or a decrease of nearly 40 per cent in ten years It would therefore icein that the Chi nese questien is solving itself in California and that the con dition in the United States generally could hardly become anything but better as a result of the extension of the present exclusion law C

TALKING ABOUT THE POST Memphis Commercial Appeal The Houston Post has broken the record and has issued an edition of sixtyfour pages dated Sunday December 8 This is the biggest newspaper ever printed in the big State and it is not a mere mass of padding the amount of adver tising justifies the size of the publication Texas is a State of great things Houston is a great and growing city and The Post is a great newspaper Austin Tribune Sundays Houston Post was a great newspaper It broke the record in Texas in point of size having sixtyfour pages making an aggregate of 448 columns Of these 244 were filled with advertising matter and 204 with news and inter esting valuable and instructive reading Everything about it was well displayed and it made a handsome appearance It was a credit to its managers and to the beautiful Magnolia City Mexia News Sundays Houston Post was the biggest thing in the shape of a newspaper ever issued in Texas sixtyfour pages about evenly divided between good readable matter and bargain ads Its a bird and speaks volumes for the enterprise of the manaSement and the business push of the railroad center of Texas TALKING ABOUT HOUSTON Goliad Guard If Houston s coming carnival is not a success it need not I t fxpricnce in carnivals as if the papers are to be believed that town has had a carnival of crime tor the past ear Crowley La Signal The fact that the Thompson rice mill in Houston received ° f ° day haS hope The Hon f p ne been a sinal ° r the opposition may have heretofore entertained of preventing l ° aRaln cut Ioose and who ° P em up or obstructing the legislation which it is proposed to get h fecclvlnK 5d fainloads of rice and again give the through It has been clearly an argument in favor of pander ing to corporate greed even more generally than is done at present under certain laws founded on republican policies that it is particularly distasteful to democratic members practically all of whom will vote to extend the provisions of the Geary law or to take some action which will have the effect of preventing an incursion of Chinese in the future 9 While it is barely possible that one or two points in favor of Chinese immigration might be advanced the fact remains that the most important feature of the whole matter is un alterably In favor of exclusion Chinese immigration would result in bringing the cheap labor of the East Into competi tion with American labor It would degrade and cheapen labor It would take away many of the already too few ad vantages enjoyed by the laboring man of this country Ameri can labor should be made expensive instead of otherwise and Chinese immigration would undoubtedly have the effect of making it otherwise No country can be prosperous if its laborers arc compelled to work for low wages The com pensation of American laborers is too low now Certainly nothing should be done to make it lower If the Chinese were to be admitted the American workingmen would be compelled to meet the competition thus brought about and in many citti thli would amount to ibiolute crime Then too the moril effect of the pretence of hundred prices on the grain The Post doesnt know anything about nee shipments If one or two Houton parties will com over 10 Cr0wley during the harvest season we w 11 pint out two trainload as big a the Houston shipment which are c ived every day in he week re and yet we fail t0 sce ay 1 gn St I US WaddUng Cl0hes when t II at tention to a twentyfivecar shipment 0ne for road Men Goliad Guard m Pl0y e eXp ° d t0 more P atlng Incl denu I 7 a r i Phap ay olh d of business men Ye about as toing a ol iff1 train is as can be f ° un 1 ° this line from conductor down Vi1 he en V rt crew bland ready to give a poll reSy and lnayS 6mlins and a ng d and crcanTe ryf0CSnd te 0S n Bessemer 5 ° Pr0m ° t0n of Jrfc u member uTjw c d ° rth iff > n 8 tfr elected to the unite e x A0 b a
