Important Matter* DIkpiisspiI and Recommendations Ma«lc—The "Wil son Kill Endorsed—The Hawaiian Milder Will lie the Sulj£Ct ot a Special "Washington, Dec, 4.—^President Cleveland's annual message, whieh was read in con gress jjoon after that body conveued at noon for its tifty-third regular session, Is as follows: To the Congress of the United States: The constituti.nial duty which requires thfc president from time to time to give tlie con gress Information of the state of the t'nion and reeoimnend to their consideration such matters as lie shall judge necessary is fit tingly entered upon by commending to the congress a careful examination of the detailed statements and well-supported rec ommendations contained in the reports of the heads of departments who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the government. In an effort to abridge this communication as much as is consistent with its purpose, I shall supplement a brief reference to the contents of these depart mental reiKtrts by Ihe mention of such executive business and incidents as are not embraced therein, and by such reeommend tions as appear to be at this particular time appropriate. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been entirely free from perplexity, no embarrassing situ ations remain that will not yield to the spir it of fairness and love which characterize a truly American foreign policy. Of the outbreak in 15ra7.il the president says: -The struggle is between the estab lished government, which controls the ma chinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and' lacking, as it does, the elements of divided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim rec ognition as beligerents. Thus far the posi tion of our government has been that of au attentive hut impartial observer of the un fortunate contliet. The questions affecting our relations with Great I'.ritain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress between the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the Bering sea tribunal of arbitration practi cal Iv effective, and it is not doubted that Great Britain will co-operate freely with this country for the accomplishment of that purpose. The dispute growing out of the documentary tolls imposed in the Welland canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States was adjusted by the substitu tion of a more equitable schedule of charges, and my predecessor thereupon sus pended his proclamation imposing discrim inating tolls upon British transit through our canals. A request for additions to the list of extraditable offenses covered by the existing treaty between the two countries is under consideration. A Special Hawaiian Messasre. It is hardlv necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our rela tions with Hawaii have caused serious em barrassment. Just prior to the Installment of the pres ent administration the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been ne gotiated between the provisional govern ment of the islands and the United States and submitted to the senate for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for examination, and dispatched lion. James H. Blount of Georgia to Honolulu as a special commis sioner to make an impartial investigation of the circumstances attending the change of government and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examina tion Mr. Blount submitted to me his re port, showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government and through the intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed, it seemed to me the only honorable course for our govern ment to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been been done by those representing us, and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible Intervention. With a view of accomplish ing tliis result whhln the constitutional limit of executive power and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities grow ing out of any changed condition brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instuctlons to that end. Thus far no information of the accomplishment of any deling results has been received. When receive" they will be promptly sent to congress, together with all othwr informa tion at hand, accompanied by a special ex ecutive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to a complete understanding of the ease, and presenting a history of all the material events leading up to the present altuation. The Treasury Department. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1803, amounted to iMttl.710.5Gl.94, and its expenditures to $4.r!.tfT4,074.1i!). Jl'hero was collected from customs $205, 3.r5.OKI,7.'! and from internal revenue ?1G1, 027,028.It:?. Our dutiable imports amounted to $421,850,711, an increase of .$51!. 453,007 over the preceding year, and importations free of duty amounted to .$444,544,211, a de crease from the preceding year of 4.rin, 447. Internal (revenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding year by $7,147,445.32 The totaj tax collected on distilled Rpiits was S'.4.720.200.55 on manufactured tobacco J31.8SO.7ii.74, and on fermented liquors, $32.-548. !S3.07. We exported merchandise Jilting the year, amounting To $*47,005,104. a decrease of $182,012,054 from the preceding year. The amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year in the history of the government, amounting to $108,080, 644, and exceeding the amount exported dur ing the preceding year by $58,485,517. The sum paid from the treasury for sugar boun ty was $0,375, i::o.8s, an increase over the preceding year of $20,335,30!). It is estimated upon the basis of present Pftvenue laws that the receipts of the gov ernment for the year ending June 30, 1804, will be $430. 121,305.38 and its expenditures f458.1 Li,305.38, resulting in a deficiency of j28.000.000. On the 1st day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in circulation, included in treasury holdings, was $1,718,544,082. an Increase for the year of $112,404,947. Estimating our population at 07,420.000 at the time mentioned, the per capita circulation was $25.49. On the same' date was In the treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,057,273, and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost, of $120,201, 653. The purchase of silver under the law of July 14, 1890, during the last fiscal year, ag gregated 54.008.102.59 fine ounces, which cost $45,531,374.53. The total amount of sil ver purchased from the time that the law became operative until the repeal of its pur chasing clause, on the 1st day of November, 1893. was 1 OS.074.590.40 fine ounces, which cost $155.930,940.84 between the 1st day of March, 1873, and the 1st day of November, 1S!3, the government purchased under all laws 503,003,717 fine ounces of silver r,t a cost of $510,622,948. The silver dollars that have been coined under the act of July 14 1890. number 3tt.087.285. The seigniorage arising from such coinage was 6.977.098.39 leaving 011 hand in the mints 140.(99.7 0 tine ounces of silver which cost $120,578,218. Our total coinage of all metals during the Inst fiscal year of valued at $43,085,178.80, of whieh there was $30,038,140 In nold coin. $5,34. 1 ). .si er dollars, $7,217,220.90 in subsidiary silver coin, and $1,080,102.90 in minor coins. Dur ing the calendar year 1892. the production of pi.-cions metals in the United States was estimated to be 1.500.375 fine ounces of gold, of the commercial and coinage value of $33, 000,X), nnd 58,000.000. tine ounces of stiver of the bullion or market value of $50,750, 000, and of the coinage value of $74,989, 000. It is estimated that on the 1st day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of money In the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to $1.213,559.100. of which $597, 097,085 was gold and $015,801,484 was sli ver. One hundred and nineteen national batiks were organized during the year ended Oct. 31. 1893. with a capital of $11,230,000 Forty-six went Into voluntary liquidation and 158 suspended. R'.xty-flve" of ihe sus pended banks were Insolvent, elghty-slx re sumed business and seven remained In the hands of bank examiners, with prospects of speedy resumption, Of thd new books or­ mwmi ganized forty-four were located in the Kast eru states, lorty-one west of the Mississippi river and tliirtv-four in the Central and Southern states. The total number of na tional banks in existence on the 31st day of October," lss)3, was 3,790, having an ag gregate capital of $095,558,120. The net in crease in the circulation of these banks (luring the year was {0.S80,'.»72. Silver rurclia.sc Repeal, The recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the government as a feature of our mone tary scheme has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs, and I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at this time pre cisely what conditions will be brought, about by the change, or what, if any, (supplement ary legislation may in the light of such conditions, appear to lie essential or ex pedient. Of course, after the recent finan cial perturbation, time is necessary for the establishment of business confidence. When, however, through this restored con fidence the money which has been fright ened into hoarding places is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the sit uation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a peimanently sound currency, abundantly sufficient: to meet every require ment of our increasing population and of business. Iu the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, determined to be content with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. Iu these ciicumstances I am convinced that a rea si 1 able delay in dealing with this subject, instead of being injurious, will increase the piol abllities of wise action. Postoftlce Department. The report of the postmaster general con tains a detailed statement of the op^-ations of the postottice department during tne last fiscal year, and much interesting informa tion touching this important branch of the public service. That there was a larger dis crepancy than usual between the pirn office receipts and expenditures is the "expected and unavoidable result- of the distressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the time covered by the postmaster general's report. At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessors that ihe deficiency on the 30th day of June. 1893, would be a little over $1,500,000. It amounted, however, to a little over $0,000, 000. At the same time, and under the in fluence of like anticipations, estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, which exhibited a Mirpius of revenue over expenditures of $872,245.71 but now. in view of the actual receipts and expenditures during that part of the cur rent fiscal year already expired, Hie present postmaster general estimates thJt, at its dose, instead of a surplus There Will Be a Deficiency of nearly $8,000,000. The postofflce receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $75.H90, 933.1G and its expenditures to $81,074,104.90. This postollice deficiency would disappear, or be immensely decreased if le.vn matter was carried free through the mails, an item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain from the agricultural department. The total number of jwstotilees in the United States on the 30th day of June, 1893, was 08.403, an Increase of 1.2S4 over the preceding year. Of these 3.300 were presi dential, an increase in that class of 204 over the preceding year, forty-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing, ranking a total of 010 cities June 30. 1893. Ninety-three other cities and towns are now entitled to this service un der the law. but it lias not yet been ac corded them on account of insufficient funds to meet the expense of its establishment. The railway mail service not only adds to the promptness of mail delivery at all of fices. but it is the especial instrumentality which puts the smaller and way places in the service on an equality in that regard with the larger and terminal offices. This branch of the postal service has, therefore, received much attention from the postmaster general, and, though it is gratifying to know that it is in a condition of hlsrh efficiency nnd great usefulness, I am led to agree with the postmaster general that there is room for its further improvement. The Navy Department. The report of the secretary of the nary contains a historv of the operations of his department during the past year and ex hibits a most gratifying condition of tlie pivsoimel of our navy. He presents a satisfactory account of the progress which had been made in the construction of ves sels and makes a number of recommenda tions to which attention Is specially in vited. During the past six months the de mands for cruising vessels have been many and urgent. There have-been revolutions, calling for vessels to protect Ameri can interests in Nicaragua. Gautemala, Costa Kica. Honduras. Argentina anil Bra zil, while the condition of affairs in Hono lulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. With all these calls upon our navy it became necessary, in or der to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol the Bering sea under the modus vivendl agreed upon with Great Britain, to detail to that service one vessel from the fish commission and three from the revenue ma rine. The following vessels of the new navy have been completed and are now ready for service: The double turreted coast de fense monitor Miantonomoh, the double turreted coast defense monitor Monterey, the armored cruiser New York, the pro tected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago, Phila delphia, Newark. San Francisco, Charles ton, Atlanta and Boston, the cruiser De troit, the gunboats Yorktown, Concord, Bennington. Machine. Castine and Petrel, the dispatch vessel Dolphin, the practice vessel Bancroft and the dynamite gunboaf Vesusivius. Of these the Bancroft, Ma* chias, Detroit and Castine have been placed in commission during the current calendar year. The following vessels are in progress of construction: The second-class battleships Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery and Marble head and the coast defense monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphitrite and Monailnock, all of which will be completed within one year the harbor defense ram Katahdin and the protected cruisers Co lumbia, Minneapolis, Olympia. Cincinnati and Italclgl). all of which will be completed prior to July 1, 1895 the first-class battle ships Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts and Oregon, which will be completed Feb. 1, 18!X5. and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed Aug. 1 of that year. It is also expected that the three gunboats authorized by the last congress will be completed in less than two years. Immigration. The superintendent of immigration, through the secretary of the treasury, re ports that during the last fiscal year there arrived at our ports 440,793 immigrants. Of these 1,063 were not permitted to land under the limitations of the law, and 577 were returned to the countries from which they came by reason of their having become public charges. The total arrivals were 141.034 less than for the previous year. The admonitions of the last two years touching our public health nnd the demon strated danger of the introduction of con tagious diseases from foreign ports has In vested the subject of national quarantine with increased Interest. A more general and harmonious system than now exists, acting promptly and directly everywhfre anil constantly operating by preventive means to shield our country from tlio In vasion of disease and at the same time having due regard to the rights nnd duties of local agencies, would, I believe, Add greatly to the safety of our people. Sea Coaot Defenses. Tt is gratifying to note that we have be gun to attain complex results In the com prehensive scheme of sea coast defenses and fortification entered upon eight years ago. A large sum has been expended, but the cost of maintenance will be inconsider able as compared with the expense of con struction and ordnance and at the end of the current calendar year, the war depart ment will have nine 12-Inch guns, twenty 10-Inch and thirty-four 8-inch truns ready to be mounted on gun lifts and carriages, and seventy-five 12-inch mortars. The manufacture of heavy ordnance keeps pace with current needs, but to render these guns available for the purposes they are designed to meet emplacements must be prepared for them. Progress has been made In this direction nnd It is desirable that congress by adequate appropriations should provide for the uninterrupted prosecution of this necessary work. Abolish the Fee System. The report of the attorney general con tains tli» usual summary of the affairs nnd proceedings of the departine.it of justice for the past year, together with certain rtcom mendations as to needed legislation on vari ous subjects. I cannot too heartily Indorse the proposition that the fee system, as applicable to the compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal courts and United States commissioners, should be abolished wltlf as Iltt'e delay as possible. It is clearly in the ly terest of the community that tfee business of bo courts, Bumwiinii both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as inexpensively transacted as the ends of justice will allow. The system is, therefore, thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation of court officials depend upon the volume of such business, and thus creales a conflict between a proper execution of the law and private gain, which cannot fail to be dangerous to the rights and free dom of the citizens, an Irresistible tempta tion to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. I also heartily join the attorney general in recommending legislation fixing degrees of federal jurisdiction, as lias been done in many of the states, authorizing writs of error on behalf of the government in cases where final judgment is rendered against the sufficiency of an indictment or against the government upon any other question arising before actual trial: limiting the right of review in cases of felony punish able only by fine and imprisonment to the circuit court of appeals, and making speedy provision for the construction of such pris ons aul reformatories as may be necessary for the confinement of United States con victs. A{fri#mltnre, The report of the secretary of agriculture will be found exceedingly interesting, es pecially to that large part of our citizens Intimately concerned in the agricultural oc cupation. On the 7th day of March. 1893, there was ui»on its pay roils 2.430 employes. This number has beeen reduced to 1.8.»0 per sons. In view of a depleted public, treasury and the Imperative demand of people for economy In the administration of their gov ernment, the secretary has entered upon the task of rationally reducing expenditures by the elimination frotn the pay rolls of all persvns not needed for an efficient conduct of the affairs of the department. During the first quarter of the present, year the ex penses of the department aggregated $345, 970.70, as against $402,021.42 for the corre sponding period of the fiscal year, ending June 30. 1893. The secretary makes appar ent his intention to continue this rate of re duction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by $994,280 than those for the present year. The amount of the appropriation for the bureau of animal industry for the current fiscal year is $850,000. The estimate for the ensuing year is $700,(W0. The regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been en forced during the last year, and the large stock yards of the country have been kept free from infection. The total number of inspections of cattle for export during the past fiscal year was 611,542. The exports snow a falling off of about 25 per cent from the preceding year, the decrease occurring entirely in the last half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to an increase in the price of American export cattle during the year ending June 30. 1893. Exports of inspected pork aggregated 20, 077,410.pounds, as against 3S,lr.2.874 pounds for the preceding year. The falling off in this export was not confined, however, to inspected pork, the total quantity exported in 1892 being G05.490.010 pounds, while in 1893 it was only 527,308.095 pounds. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892. attained the enormous fig ure of $800,000,000 in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent of our total exports. In the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but, nevertheless, reached $01 , 000,000. being 75.1 per cent of all American commodities exported. A review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their destination, will show that in al most every line the United Kingdom of Great Britlan anil Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle, the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, $26,000,000, of which Great Britiau took considerably over $25,000,000. Of beef products of all kinds, our total exports were $28,090,000, of which Great Britian took $24,000,000. Of pork products the total exports were $S4.000,000, of which Great Britiau took $53,000,.R0. In bread stuffs, cotton and minor products of like proportions sent to the same desti nation are shown. In the year 1839 the congress appropri ated $l,0tk, to be taken from the patent office funds, for the purpose of collecting and distributing rare and improved varie ties of seeds nnd for prosecuting agricult ural investigations and procuring agricult ural statistics. From this small beginning the seed division of the department of ag riculture has grown to its present unwieldy and unjustifiable extravagant proportions. During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $60,548.01. The remainder of an appropriation of $135,000 was ex pended in putting them up and distributing them. I11 each state and territory an agricultural experiment station has been established. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds, and yet this indiscriminate and wasteful dis tribution by legislation and legislator con tinues, answering no purpose unless it be to remind constituents that their representa tives are willing to remember them with gratuities at public cost. Civil Service Reform. The continued intelligent execution of the civil service law and the increasing ap proval by the people of its operation are most gratifying. The recent extension of its limitation and regulations to the em ployes at the free delivery postotlices, which has been honestly and promptly accom plished by the commission by the hearty co-operation of the postmaster general, Is an Immensely important advance in the use ft'ness of the system. 1 am, If possible, more than ever con vinced of the incalculable benefits conferred by the civil service law, not only in its effect upon the public service, but also, what is even more important, in its effect in elevating the tone of political life gen orally. Since 18S6 congress has at each session authorized the building of one or more ves sels, and the secretary of the navy pre sents an earnest plea for the continuance of this plan. He recommends the authori zation of at least one battleship and six torpedo boats. While I am distinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the policy we have inaugurated in building up a thor ough and efficient navy. 1 can not refrain from the suggestion that the congress should carefully take into account the num ber of unfinished vessels on our hands and the deplei"l condition of our treasury iu considering the propriety of an approprla tion at this time to begin new work. The Pension Bureau. On the 30th uay of June, 1S93, there were on the pension rolls 900,012 names, an In crease of 89,944 over the number on the rolls June 30, 1892. Of these there were seventeen widows and daughters of revolu tionary soldiers, 80 survivors of the war of 1812. 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3.882 survivors and widows of Indian wars, 284 ar^tiy nurses and 475,645 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the War of the Re bell lion. The latter number represents those pensioned on nccount of disabilities or death resulting from army and navy service. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1893, who were pen sioned under the act of June 27, 1890, which include also pensions on account of death and disabilities not chargeable to army service, was 459,555. The number added to the rolls during the year was 123, 634, anil the number dropped was 33,000. I The first payments on pensions allowed ilur- 1 lng the year amounted to $33,576,549.98. This includes arrears or the accumulation between the time from which the allowance of the pension dates and the time of act ually granting the certificate. Although the law of 1890 permits pensions for disa bilities now related to military service, yet as a requisite to its benefit a disability must exist in Incapacitating applicants "from the performance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support." The execution of this law in Its early stages does not seem to have been in accord with its true intention, but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construction was given to tlie statute, and since that time this con struction has been followed. This has had the effect of limiting the operations of the law to Its intended purpose. The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, the com mission suspended payments upon a num ber of pensions which seem to be fraudu'ent or unauthorized pending a complete exami nation, giving noiice to the pensioners in order that they might have au opportunity to establish, if possible, the justice of their claims, notwlthsandlng apparent invalidity. I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Ev ery name fraudulently put unon these rolls is a wicked Imposition upon the klrnllv sen timent in which pensions have their oiign. Tlie IndiaiiM. The eondton of the Iiuliv.is and their ulti mate fate are subjects which are related a »ynipathjr ot ©Wt poopla. to sacred dirtv of the government, and which flh-tmgly appeal to the souse of Justice aowj Cwr Indtaf number about 248,000. Most of them are lo cated on sixteen reservations containing 80, 116,531 acres of land. About 10,000 of those Indians have, to «i large degree, adopted civilized customs.

Tariff Reform Economy In public ixpendituro Is a duty that cannot innocently be neglected by those entrusted with the control of money drawn from the people for public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently endless resources, the familiarity of our people with immense accr.mul itlonr. of wealth the growing sentiment among them that the expenditure of public money should in some manner be to their immedi ate and personal advantage the indirect find almost stealthy manner in which a large part of our taxes are exacted, and a degenerated sense of official accountability have led to growing extravagance in gov ernmental approbations. The duty of public economy Is also of immense importance in its intimate and necessary relation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to meet government expenditure and yet reducing the people's burden of erate taxation. After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. Nothing so important claims our atten tion and nothing so clearly presents itself as both an opportunity and a duty—an op portunity to observe the gratitude of our fellow citizens, a duty imposed upon us by our oft-repeated professions and by the emphatic mandate of the people. Axier full discussion, our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform, and they have con fided the work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it. If there Is anything in the theory of a rep resentation in public places of the people and their desires, if public officers are really the servants of the people, and if political promises and professions have any binding lorce. our failure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should interfere to distract our attention or disturb our effort until this reform is ac complished by wise and careful legislation. While we should staunchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue Justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation, and that they should be limited by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up among us In which justice and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our government actually demand. Manifestly, if we are to aid the people directly through tariff re form one of the most obvious features should be a reduction in present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The benefits of such a reduction would be pal pable and substantia), seen and felt by the thousands who would be better fed anil bet ter clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the willing benefactions of a gov ernimnt whose liightr function is the pro motion of the people. Nob less closely re lated to our people's prosperity and well being is the removal of the restrictions upon the importation Qf the raw materials necessary to our manufacturers. The world would be open to our ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot be while fedral legislation through the imposition of high tariff forbids to American manufacturers as cheap material as those used by their compe titors. It is quite obvious that the enhance ment of the price of our manufactured pro ducts resulting from tills policy not only confines the market for these products with in our own borders to the direct disadvan tage of our manufacturers, but also in creases their cost to our citizens. Tlie inter ests of labor are certainly, though indirect ly. involved in this feature of our tariff system. The sharp competition anil active Struggle among our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their goods, soon fill the narrow market to which they are con fined. Then follows a suspension 'of work in mills and factories a discharge of employes and distress in the homes of our working men. Even if the often disproved assertion could be made good, that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw material and low tariff1, does the Intelligence of our worklngmen lead them quickly to discover that their steady employment permitted by free raw material is the most important factor in their relation to tariff legislation. A measure has been prepared by the ap propriate congressional committee emobdy lng tariff reform on the lines nerein sug gested, which will be promntlv submitted for legislative action. It is the result of much patriotic and unselfish work, and I believe it deals with its subject as oonsist ly and thoroighlv as existing condition? permit. I am satisfied that he redued tar iff duty provided for in the proposed legis lation. added to the existing Internal reve nue taxation, will in tlie near fun re, fcousrh, perhaps, not immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of th government. The committee, after full con sideration, and to provide against a tempo rary deficiency which may exist before the business of the country adjusts itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely em braced In their plan a few additional in ternal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon Incomes derived from certain corpo rate investments. The new assessments are not only abso lutelv just and easily borne, but they have the furtherment o-f beinsr such as can be re mitted without unfavorable disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that if success can only be attained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform, and as a result of their willingness 1o subordi nate personal desires and ambitions to the general eood. The local interest affected by the proposed reform are so numerous anil so vnrf-ed that if all are insisted unon the legislation embodying the reform must in evitably fall. In consluslon my intense feeling of re sponsibility Impels ine to invoke for the manifold Interests of a generous and con filling people the most scrupulous care and to nledge my willing support, to every legls lative effort for the advancement of the greatness and prosperity of our beloved count-y. 

C,ROVER CLEVELAND, Executive Mansion, Washington, D. O., Dec. 4, 1893. UnlcR Ayrage Ilisrher in Every Stateln rae Union Except Oreeron. If nobility mav be estimated In dollars, the mule is a nobler animal than the horse, says the New York Sun. Yet there are 110 autumnal mule shows, and even if there were it Is hardly probable that flower adorned young women would make a prac tice of patting the prize animal. The only way to pat a mule, according to the Texas code, is with a fence rail or a board. The man who collected horse and mule statistics for the census report shows that the average price of a mule is $7 more than the average pricc of n horse. The ordinary mule In 1 South Carolina, which owns about 55.000 of the long-eared beasts, is worth about $90 the average price o1 a horse In the same state is about $79. Texas probably has more mules (about 200.000) than any other state. The average price is about $41, or nearly twice the value of a Texas horse. In Missouri mules are worth about $7 more and In Kentucky about $3 more than horses. Only a few states have no mules, or so few that the statistician didn't make a note of them. One of these states is Rhode Island, which the mule driver of Texas doubtless would think is not any too large a pastur age nnd plav ground for a festive mule of Southern birth. Oregon Is the only state where horses bring higher prices than mules. The ordinary mule out there is worth $4(5 nnd the horse $51. The figures for alCallfomla are: Mules, $07 horses, $46. In Pennsylvania, where mules, famous for longevity, are much us-d In the mines, thev bring about $86: horses. $17. In this state there are seventy times as many horses as there tire mules, which number about 14,000. A New York mule is worth $91 and n horse $76. Mules are prized more In New Jersey than In any other st-ite. the average price beinsr about $106. or $30 more than horses. Illinois has about 140.000 ranle*, or more than any other Westers State. TIIUHSTON OFF FOE HAWAII l'HE HAWAIIAN MINISTER SUDDEN LY LEAVES WASHINGTON. It la Supposed That His Ultimate Destination Is Honoinl n- His Dfr» purture Canses Considerable prise and Speculation. Washington, Dec. 8.—Minister Thurs ton, the representative of the provisional government of Hawaii, furnished the surprise in Hawaiian affairs to-d&y by quietly departing from the city for the West, and it is surmised that he is. juite likely to go to Honolulu before re turning to Washington. His secret de parture excited considerable comment and there was much speculation as to its significance. It can be stated, however, that liis departure does not mean any break in the recognition this government heretofore has always accorded him as the accredited representative of the de facto government of Hawaii. Mr. Thurs ton was not given his passports, nor was there any interruption in the amenities which have been observed in the outer iiplomatic relations between the minister and Secretary Gresham. Before leav ing Mr. Thurston and Secretary of Lega tion Hastings were both at the state de partment. They said that they had been cordially received. Mr. Thurston at this time said nothing of his intention to leave the city to newspaper men who saw Kim, but went to his apart meats and then tcok the train on tiu Pennsyhania road for Chicago. Mrs. Thurston, his mother, ind his young son, remain in Washington, and the official status of the Hawaiian legation is continued Avith Mr. Hastings, the secretary, acting as charge d'affaires. From Chicago Mr. Thurston will go to San Francisco, and his ultimate desti nation may be Honolulu, where he would liavt an opportunity to orally advise the Hawaiian government. Opinion is freely expressed that the action of the senate in calling 011 the president for the Hawa iian coriespondence has satisfied the min ister that the subjcct will take care of itself in this country and that, his energies can be directed with best results in ad vising and helping the provisional govern mtut to hold its ground. The Iownn Diocese. Sioux City, Iowa, Dec. 9.—The Episco pal convention, diocese of Iowa, com pleted its work and adjourned this morn ing, after re-electing Archdeacon Me Klroy of Waverly secretary and Thomas Eaton of Ottumiwa treasurer.

After discussion, a new committee, consisting of lleverends Wil kin, Des Moines Green, Cedar Rapids, and Cornell, Sioux City, and Laymen Ilenry, Des Moines and Beaver, Cedar Rapids, was appointed to take action as to the location, the report to be made at the next convention. It is. understood that the committee is favorable to a lo cation other than Sac City. No action was taken in regard to the appointment of an assistant bishop on account of the lack of sufficient plecges from parishes for his support.

All the old miners who have seen it say they a--o persuaded that underneath the sand stone bottom there is another and better vein. A peculiarity of the coal is its leanness. A lump can he taken into the hand without leaving ny soil. Tramps at Creston. Creston, Iowa, Dec. 8.—Mrs. Myers, a plucky little woman, frustrated a da# tardly attempt by a tramp.
