GIVES LIE TO FORMER SENSATIONAL REPORTS Any Action Taken to Secure In crease in Wages Will Be Regular. CHICAGO, . Dec. G. William G. Lee, president of the Brotherhood of Rail way Trainmen, tonight sent u mes sage to President Tafl assuring jlrim that sensational reports regarding a general railroad strike were without foundation. Following is President Lee's message to President Taft: f'Tn order that yourself and the pub lic may know the truth. I deem it neces sary to state that the press 'reports indicating that a strike of the Brother hood of -Railwav Trainmen, and other affiliated organizations, threatens at this time as a result, of the demands made fpr incrcasod pav iu the territory oast of Chicago, are absolutely without foundation. Only Formal Action. "Whatever action is taken bv the organization 1 represent will depend en tirely upun the- individual expression of the members through the general committee for tho railways in the ter ritory and. will be handled iu the usual .maimer. The demands of the train employes in train and yard service cast of Chicago cannot take proper form even for dcliberaro consideration be tween the railway officials and their employes before the early pari of TJ'10. ''AJ1 this talk about a strike of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and affiliated organizations is absurd, and the membership of the organization fully realizes it " 

RUMORS OF STRIKE DECLARED PREMATURE NEW YORK, Dec Rumors of an impending strike." said Vice Presi dent rurdock of the Jirot herhood of .Railway Trainmen, today, "are prenia tine, and we believe they are circu lafed to influence the roads of the northwest, into granting the demands of the .switchmen s union of North America.- We have jiothing to do with that movement, and have troubles enough of our own without entering into any others. "Our proposals have not been sub mitted to the management of the east ern railroads.ud wc have no reason to suppose that they will be refused until they aro submitted. It is uo se cret that we have long felt wo aro entitled to higher wages. A demand for them was deferred two years ago when the financial panic caused a pause." A. II. .Smith, vice president and gen eral manager of tho New York Central, said today: "The company is on the most friend ly terms with its emplo.yos.M In other well-informed quarters it was said tonight that as the railroads have long contemplated an increase in freight rates, they are not in a position io treat-the request for an increase in wages from their employes loo brusquely. Two other railroad brotherhoods, those of the Locomotive Firemen and Railroad Conductors, it was stated to night, have decided to join the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen iu the demand on eastern railroads for a :JU per cent, increase in wages. About ilSS.oOO men in all are involved in de i mands to be made.

Although Fernandez took his ma chine to Rhoims in aviation weok, dif ficulties in - start ing always prevented au actual flight until today. . The accident appears to h3ve been due mainly to the jnexporience and reck lessness of the aviator, who, impatient at the delay and not heeding expostula tions of his mechanician, patched up a defective part of the machine by bind iug it with common twin". Fatal Turn Made. The aeroplane sailed off gracefnllv, amid the cheers of the spectators, and the inventor's hope seemed to bo ful filled when, after going two hundred meters and gradually rising, tho avi ator attempted to mnk.e a turn too sharp! v, and t.hr machino tipped over. Fernandez fell to the ground, strik ing with the wreck of his aeroplane on top of him. The aviator was found crushed beneath tho, motor, his head having been driven into the soft earth bv the impact. The victim was a - strikingly hand some man, well known in Nice, where lie was a fashionable woman 'h tailor, lie took up aviation recently, devoting all his time to it. lie was convinced that, his machine, which resembleil both j t'ho Wright and the Curfiss machines, was absolutely superior to any other. v IXlH-HnHi-- .J.

That .there has becu a careful scrutiny of the esti mates of appropriations for the fiscnl year ending Juno 30, JOIL is shown by the figures submitted to tho house of reprcscnlativcs- today. by Secretary of! the Treasury MaoVeagh. The grand total of estimates for 1fHl is 732.223,07o, which is .$103,370,303 less than the appropriations for the cur rent fiscal year and $123,0GG,403 under tho estimates submitted a year ago for BM0. A general cut has Jjccn made wherevur possible and new work au thorized only where regardeU as abso lutely necessary. Heretofore it has been the practice of departmental officers to "pad" the estimates with tho expectation that they would bo matoriidly reduced before be ing finally passed by congress.' As soon as President Taft canio into office ho directed that Ibis practice bo discontinued and gavo notice io the members of his cabinet that in the fu ture all estimates must be submitted on the basis of tho actual needs and re quirements of the service. The result is, tho officials say, that the figures submitted today aro down to bedrock and will bear the closest examination by the appropriation com mittees of both houses of congress. Large reductions in tho estimato as compared with the appropriations for tho current year are: In the treasury department!, a decrease of $12,000,000 for public works; in the war department, about $0,000,000 in the military estimate, made up of decreases in tbo estimates for regular supplies, construction works for the army, mount ed equipt ?nt. transportation, "ordnance and manufacture of anus, and $2.y00. 000 for public works, exclusive of tho Panama canal. Dowu to Bedrock. In tho navy department, decrease of $26,000,000, duo partly to tho fact that Secretary Meyer has not asked for any monov for new ship? and that:. only $4, 000,000' is required for armor and ar mamonfc. as agaiust. an appropriation of S12.-152.000 for this year. In the postotfico tlepartmont a re duction of .5.000,000 iu the estimated deficiency in (he postal revenues; and iu tho departmont of commerco and la bor a decrease from ?10,000,000 to $2, 000,000 is on account of the thirteenth census.
