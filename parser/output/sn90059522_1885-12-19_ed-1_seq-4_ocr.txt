The stock market has again become exceed ingly dull. At the opening there was a loss of J£ to % and a further decline followed, af ter which the market became more firm and moved slowly upwards with only a moderate j reaction. After midday a decided strength was exhibited in the last hour, and the mar ket closed dull and firm at or near the best figures of the day. Northern Pacific preferred was very firm and showed an advance of 1%. The report that this road had sold a large block is authoritatively denied. The wheat market at Chicago was nervous and unset tled, closing %o lower than the day before. At St. Paul quotations were the pnmo as on the previous day. At Minneapolis higher prices were, asked, but buyers would not coino up and the market remained the same as on the preceding day. SUB OF THE NEWS.

And all great j railway linos are pointing toward St. Paul. ; Senator S.vrsrx was greeted at the Garkett banquet in»New York last night as the rep , resentative of the western terminus of the Baltimore it Ohio trunk live. The banquet I was given to President Garrktt of that i j road in celebration of the consolidation of I j the Staten Island road and making New I York the eastern terminal of the line. It had boon arranged to have the banquet the day following the day on which Mr. Vas deruilt died, but was postponed on ac- | count of the occurrence of his death. It will be remembered that Mr. Vanber j bilt was in conversation with Mr. Rohert 

GABBETT at the time he dropped dead. The Baltimore & Ohio company is one that has never permitted its stock to be watered, and consequently only pays dividends ou a bona fide capital. Now that it has con cluded its eastern terminal facilities after a long, hard tight, all it will have to do now is to turn its attention to extending its line from Chicago to St. Paul. As Senator Satun assurred our Eastern friends last night, there will be no trouble at this end of the line. All that they will have to do is to let us know that they are coining and the gates will be thrown wide opeu and j with extended arms we will bid them wel | come. It is only a question of time, and not a very long time either, when the line of the Baltimore <fc Ohio will extend from St. Paul, the metropolis of the Northwest, to New York, the metropolis of the conti nent. OLEOMARGAEINB DISCUSSION. A few days ago the Gi.op.e published a communication from Dairy Commissioner I Howard defending the constitutionality of the law prohibiting the sale and rnanufact- j I ure of oleomargarine in this state. Into-] : day's issue we publish the communication J of Mr. C. P. Baxtbb in reply to Mr. Howard's card. It will be observed that in the discussion of this subject Mr. How ard follows in the line of the argument j used by counsel for the oleomargarine manufacturers in the light they made against the law in the states of Missouri, New York and Pennsylvania. The supreme court of New York held, as Judge Koox of t'.ie Hennepin district did, that the law was unconstitu tional. The supreme court of Pennsylvania \ takes the contrary view and holds that the \ legislature has the constitutional right to [ enact such a law. The opponents of the law urge that it is a violation of both the federal and state constitutions, in that it abridges the right of a citizen to earn a livelihood in the pursuit of a reputable busi ness. They claim that oleomargarine is only a substitute for butter, that it is made j from pure animal fats, and contains the j same elements as dairy butter, the only dif ference being that the manufactured arti cle contains a smaller per cent, of butterine, and that it is capable of being applied to the suine uses as an article of food as the ordi i dary dairy butter. Hence, they argue, that I they are entitled to put their substitute on | the market In competition with the original | article, and that in this right they are pro -1 tected by the fourteenth a mendment to j the constitution of the United States, as j well as the first section of article one of our state constitution, which guarantee to all citizens equal privileges and immuni ; ties. On the face of it the oleomargarine 1 people have a good case. But it is only I superficial. As has been repeatedly de cided by the highest courts of the nation and of all the states, and a well settled principle growing out of the nature of civil society, the rights and immunities guaran- j teed to the citizen by the constitu tion are only such as are not in jurious to the rights of the comnra i nity and are not in conflict with the equal enjoyment of the rights of others. While it is axiomatically true that all men are born free and equal, it is not Implied that each I and every individual has the right to do just i as his individual whims dictate without re- I gard to the rights and privileges of other , members of society. So it is when the con- ! stitution guarantees tiie full enjoyment of I civil and religious rights to the citizens of a i government it means such rights as are | legal and not injurious to the public wel ! fare. The constitution guarantees religious ! | freedom, yet it will not be maintained that ' tiiis feature of the constitution can be con strued into a protection of the polygamous practices of the Mormons under the guise of religion. The inherent right of self protection exists in a state just as it does in | the individual. Thus it is that courts and j constitutions have come to recognize the fundamental principle designated the police power of the state. This power is vested ; in the legislature and to that department of j the government is left the determination of ! what laws and regulations are needed to protect the public health and secure the public safety and comfort. Just where the line shall be drawn between the exercise of this police power and the invasion of pri ; vate rights has been the subject of legal dis- c ussion and judicial decisions from time j immemorial. As an illustration of how courts will differ in theit definition or rather description of this power, we have the two notable decisions respecting the oleomar garine law rendered respectively by the su | preme courts of New York and Pennsyl j vania. Although they reach different con i elusions, both courts agree that this grant i of legislative power never included a power for the destruction of a harmless industry, | nor under the pretense of police regulation ' can the rights of property be invaded or the citizen be divested of the right to earn a ! livelihood in a legitimate manner. The New York court decided the case before it I upon the theory that the intent of the oleo margarine law was to prohibit an important branch of industry for the sole reason that it competed with another. Conceding that this theory was correct, then it follows that the decision was correct. But the Pennsyl vania court does not concede it. On i the contrary, it assumes that the legislature had a bona tide intention to pro . tect the public health ami prevent the adul teration of dairy products and fraud iv their ■ ! salo. And basing its decision' upon this theory the court held that the law was not • repugnant to the constitution. It adopted i the view of the Missouri court that the cen tral idea of the statute was the prevention t of facilities tor selling or manufacturing an j article of butter resembling the genuine ! : article so closely in Us external appearance ' j tis to render it easy to deceive purchasers into buying that which they would not buy 1 1 but for the deception. The Perm " | sylvania decision will stand be , cause it is founded on common BetiSe and is in sympathy with the opinion ■ of the great nw-s of the people. Oleomar garine is nor wanted. If it was in demand I ; the dealers in the article would not resort to • the deception of imposing it upon their cus tomers as butter. It is butter, good, pure, sweet butter, that consumers want. They do not ask tor a substitute, made of all sorts of animal fat. We are inclined to agree with Dairy Commissioner Howard that the Minnesota law will stand a judicial test. If it does not then our advice to the legisla ture would be to pick its flint and try it again. If the police power of a state doesn't extend to protecting its citizens from fraud and the substitution of unwholesome articles of food for that which is useful and healthy then we have very little use for courts or legislatures. EXECUTIVE SESSIONS. The Washington correspondent of the New York 'World, who has been investigat ing the matter, says that there Is no prob ability of ever getting the senators to sup port a proposition to abolish executive ses sions unless an aroused public sentiment should demand it. As long as the public is indifferent to the matter the senators are going to stick to the executive session busi ness. In fact, an executive session is noth ing more than a senatorial picnic. As Boon as the public has been driven out and the doors closed the senators drop their dig nity and resume the levity of ordinary men. They are perfectly at their ease in executive session, and whenever a senator attempts to talk in the strained and dignified way they have on the floor when in open session, the Other senators commence a series of groans, coughs and jeers which soon bring the speaker up standing and to a realization of the fact that he is now in among the boys and is not expected to do the dignity act. Thej' lighten the burthens of the dull routine of executive sessions by having lunch served on their desks, and frequently a bottle of wine otiened to fortify themselves against the heaviness of the work in hand. When the lunch is cleared away the cigars are lighted and, with their feet cocked over the top of the desks, the grave and reverend senators discuss in an informal way the secrets of state. The tedium of discussing a dull treaty or of in vestigating the offensive partisanship of some luckless appointee is frequently re lieved by the telling of a good story or cracking jokes at the expense of each other. Just as Senator Er>- HUHDS is about to launch into a learned disquisition on the constitutional features of the latest reciprocity treaty. Senator Vanck will divert the attention of the body by relating the Tar Heels' coon hunt, or as Senator Sherman is in the midst of a tirade against the bloodthirsty rebels, who have, by the connivance of the Cleveland administration, usurped the power of government, Senator Vest will interpose to convulse the senate with laugh ter by telling how Pugh of Alabama went to the White house to secure some appoint ments in his state, and, when the president seemed to give him a deaf ear, how, in a rage of disappointment, he was found walking up and down Pennsyl vania avenue next day anathematizing "that hindquarter of beef up there in the executive chair." The senators have a good time of it beyond all question when they get into executive session. The per sonal comfort of the senators is so much in volved in these star-chamber proceedings that it seems a pity to disturb them. But the people are getting tired of this behind the-scene business. It is as much out of place in the senate as in the saloon. The popular theory now-a-days is that if an in dividual wants to take a glass of toddy he ought to step right up to the bar and drink it publicly. And there is the same theory in relation to matters which come before con gress. If the senators want to discuss an executive appointment they ought to be made to stand right up in their places in the senate and have their say right before the whole nation. 

ANOTHER RIVEK CONVENTION". The executive committee of the Missouri valley improvement has issued a, call for a waterway convention to be held at Kansas City on Tuesday, the 29th day of December, to take into consideration the great import ance of the improvement of the Missouri river, and of combined and active efforts to secure that end. Stimulated by the success of the convention held in this city during the past summer, the people of the Missouri valley seem to have awakened to the neces sity of prompt and united action in order to secure appropriations for the improvement of their river. As an illustration of how im portant this matter is to the people of the Missouri valley, the execu tive committee recalls the fact that in 1878 a lleet of barges was sent from St. Louis to Kansas City for a cargo of grain. They succeeded in making a successful trip, carrying out 208,516 bushels of corn and 44,108 bushels of wheat at a cost of s}£ cents per bushel for transportation, includ ing insurance. At the same time the rail roads were charging 13 cents per bushel on wheat and 8 cents on corn. It is also stated that although the barges made the upward trip empty they made at the rate charged a profit of 100 per cent. The com mittee estimates that if the river between St. Louis and Kansas City was improved to successfully employ barges, it would save in the matter of transportation of wheat and corn alone 515.000.000 annually, or nearly twice the estimated cost of improv ing the whole of the 800 miles between St. Louis and Sionx City. And if the river was improved from St. Louis to Sioux City it is estimated that twice this amount would be saved annually or four times the estimated cost of improving the river to that point. In its address the committee says: From the facts disclosed by the experi mental fleet of 1878, and from a knowledge of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, derived from a long experience with them, Capt. Lowery, who had charge of the Babbage company's* fleets in 1878, arrived at the con clusion that with adequate improvement of these rivers, grain can be carried from Kansas City to New Orleans at a freight charge of 7 cents per bushel. It is believed that a corresponding rate from all other Missouri river points, and 3 cents added for the higher costs of ocean freightage to foreign markets from New Orleans than from At lantic ports, would not exceed 12 cents per bushel, making the grain available for export from New Orleans at the same charge as from Atlantic ports. The current rail rates for years past from Missouri river points to Atlantic ports has not been less than 21 cents on wheat and 16 cents on corn — a difference of 4 cents on corn and 9 cents on wheat in favor of the river route. The price of grain in tho Missouri valley is the price in foreign markets, less ] the cost of placing it there. The price in I foreign markets is fixed by the supply from countries other than our own, hence this saving, if realized as it may be by the im provement of our rivers, will inure to the producers in the Missouri valley, and will ap ply to the entire product of our farms, as well as to that part, exported. The product of the Missouri valley in the census year 1879, the last for which we have accurate statistics, was 61.116.377 bushels of i wheat and 414,319.526 bushels of corn. These | crops at 4 and 9 cents respectively give a to j tal sum of $-2,074,456, which river transpor- I tation would save to the producers of the : Missouri valley, on each crop like that of | 187 S. We have to consider, however, not alone j the benefits that may be secured, but the ': dangers that may be averted. The hifh cost : of transportation in this conntry, maititaln i ing as it does the high cost of American grain I in foreign markets, and the reduced cost of ; transportation from grain-producing coun tries in Asia incident to the opening of the | Suez canal, reducing as it does the cost of gram from those countries delivered in the game markets,has so stimulated their product i that they threaten soon to drive American grain from all markets accessible to both, and so reduce the broflt of its production in the Missouri valley as to depress our agricul j tural industries and compel the adoption of ' other products. The contrast between American griiin and that of other countries for primacy In the world's markets is now re duced to a matter of transportation. ~mm THE DAKOTA SQUABBLE. In the senatorial high school Vkst of Missouri stands above Logan in the gram mar class, but Lobas seems to get the di ploma on history. It must have been rather mortifying to a gentleman of Mr. VkBt's self-esteem to have been turned down as he was by Gen. Logan yesterday in the dis cussion of the Dakota admission bill. The ; moral of it is, that when a man talks he ought to know what ho is talking about. So far as the discussion has gone it seems to betray a lamentable ignorance on the part of all the senators of the subject under discussion. They are treating it purely in the light of a party question without regard to the interests of the government or tho wishes of the people of Dakota. We are sorry to see the admission question make this bad start. Instead of wasting time over something that is intangible, if the senate would pass a bill providing for the admission of Dakota, there would be no trouble so far as the house is concerned. The bill now before the senate might ap propriately be entitled a bill to postpone ad mission. MINNESOTA AND NEW ORLEANS. In an interview with the Globe this morning Mr. Bailey, who has just re turned from New Orleans, points out most forcibly what Minnesota has missed by not being represented at this winter's exposi tion. The position that this state occupied at the exposition last winter makes its ab sence at this time the more conspicuous. The Globe did not hesitate to say some time ago that the two cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis could very well have af forded to defray the expenses of an exhibit this winter. We are still of the opinion that a mistake was made by not doing so. THE NEXT ISSUE. When time can be spared from trivial questions like the presidential succession, silver coinage and the tariff, it might be well for congress to decide the momentous question as to which cabinet officer should sit at the president's right hand at dinner parties. Ex-Minister Lew Wallace, just arrived in this country, is enthusiastic in his praise over the president's message. Gen. Wal lace has been so long out of the country that he perhaps does not know the presi dent has hardly anything left to give away except fourth-class postoflices. The senate in passing a bill to give Mrs. Grant a pension of $5,000 a year may have been simply following a precedent, but under the peculiar circumstances, every chivalrous American would have at once cried "shame" ■'a«t there been any opposition to the move ment. One who has had opportunity and occasion to learn the facts, makes the statement that 50 per cent, more children are born in the families of editors in North Dakota than in the average of households there. This is an other evidence of the public spirit and enter prise of the Dakota press. It is very unkind of Boston to organize a counter attraction just as St. Paul's ice pal ace carnival promises to be so successful. Koscoe Coxkling und Ben Bctleh have bceu retained to defend Parson Downks and Mrs. Tabor, who have been indicted. Thus far the senate has introduced 470 new bills even without the '"cold tea" stimu lant. Had prohibition not been the order of i ho day, it is fearful to contemplate the num ber which the dignified statesmen would have concocted. Congressman Ward, the millionaire Chi cago congressman, has given his wife his two years' salary. It is not stated whether he is a Ward in chancery and takes this method of making himself solid with the powers that be. IT is stated that England has 1.000,000 more women than men. Dakota will be loth to lose him, but there seems to be a pressing necessity for the services of Col. Donan in the little island across the seas. It's not the largest stocking that will catch the handsomest presents. So the pretty St. Paul maiden with the dainty footgear need not send to Chicago for hosiery to properly celebrate Christmas. Montana professionals will look with awe now unmingled with pride at the astounding record of the Bioomington, 111., man who un aided has Stolen 500 horses within tho past three years. Tt is said that Americans like to be hum bugged, but they will probably draw the line at the Now York swindle of artificial eggs made from composition, albumen and mashed carrots. Despite the $50,000 libel suit brought against Editor Pulitzer by Mayor Grace tho World had energy enough left last Sunday to get out a mammoth edition of thirty-eight pages. Arsenic put in the soup by the cook is found by a Montreal club to be n more effect ual way of disposing- of objectionable candi dates for admission than the black ball. The reviving commercial prosperity throughout the country will bring about a happier Christmas in many homes than has been enjoyed for many a year. -«_ Scotch colonies are being located in Florida. Florida has an abundant supply of lemons and sugar and the colonies will come pro vided with the other necessary. . Henry Ward Beecheb has been presented with a watch to take the place of the one re cently stolen from him. He will be watched with interest by pickpockets. Congressman McAdoo wishes it distinctly understood that he had no arrangement with Gidbeht and Sullivan in reference to nam ing their latest opera. The Servians have petitioned King Milan to go and take Sofia. Alexander thinks the Servians betray indications of becoming ad mirable humorists. Now Quebec has an epidemic of measles the rivalry beween that town and Montreal is so visible that it can be spotted at a glance. The Hastings, Minn.. New Era is early in the field with an illustrated Christinas num ber of exceptional merit. Trichinosis will soon rank with dynamite as the greatest of modern life destroyers. . - An Others See Us. Chicago Tribune. We observe that Minneapolis has allowed herself to be outwitted by St. Paul in the matter of a report on the number of new buildings erected in the respective cities within the last year. Minneapolis was so fool ish as to issue a report first, thus giving St. Paul the last word and the field. It appears that in Minneapolis in 1885 there have been erected 2.178,363 new buildings at an aggre gate value of 81,000,000.000.87. In St. Paul, within the same period, have been erected 4,178,463 new buildiugs at an aggregate value of 52,000.000,000.88. In Minneapolis the build ings averaged eighteen stories in height; in St. Paul nineteen stories in height. Minnea' - ' olis will know better than to get a report out first next time. Bishop Whipple's Earnest Plea. New York Mail and Express. We have received au earnest and eloquent plea by the universally esteemed and beloved Bishop Whipple of Minnesota in behalf of the Chippewa Indians. It is proposed to de prive them of a part of their reservation. Bishop Whipple, who knows all the facts and equities in the case, says that to do this would be to add another to the long list of wrong's perpetrated by our own race on harmless Indians, who within twenty-live years have so far yielded to the inlluencir- of Christian civilization that 1,500 of them are living by their labor. Bishop Whipple's words on such a subject will travel swift and far and will carry con- Tiction. for he knows all about these Indians, their characteristics, habits, history and [ tsndencies. He gives his word to the coun try, as t-> the Chippewas, that "there is not ' In the state a more orderly Christian com- i munity than the Indians of the White Earth Reserve. Their influence is folt throughout the Chippewa nation. The Indians at Leech Lake, White Oak Point, Casa Lake and Mille Lao must perish where they are; they can and will be saved if removed to White Earth." Bishop Whlpple adds: All the talk about danger from Indian massacre, by pine rings, is just to blind the eyes of Christian men to robbery. We have no title whatever to these lands except Ahab'a plea to rob , Naboth of the vineyard. These lands belong to the Chip pewas, and they need them for their chil dren and children's children. Their children have no right to dispose of their people's in heritance. These men at White Earth are our fellow Christians. Their heathen broth ers are children of one God and Father. A portion of these wild Indians have a right on the White Earth reservation, and we cannot justly prevent their removal to it. Such a plea ought to prevent the contemp lated outrage, on the Chlppewas. We gladly help along such an utterance from such a source or such a theme. Bishop Whipple is a sort of unordained archbishop over all the Indians of the Northwest. Let his unselfish and wise advice control the action of the gov ernment. A Bosh Paper. Calmer, la., Clarion. During the past year the St. Paul Globe has been a welcome visitor daily to this of fice, and we freely confess that no newspaper in tho West outstrips the Globe for enter prise. While thoroughly Democratic it treats all subjects with fairness, and with an in dependence that wins admiration from those who differ in opinions. The Globe is a boss paper. A Question of Intrinsic Value. Chicago Times. • To the remark that "the silver in a Bland dollar is to-day worth 80 cents," a silver crank editor responds: "Now tell me what the paper in a paper dollar is worth."

Washington, Dec. 18.— Dr. Wiliiam Hill of Bioomington, 111., United States consul at Port Sarnia, reports to the Indian bureau that one George William Roberts, a Cherokee, has spent some weeks with the Chippewas at Sarnia, Kettle Point and Wapole islands. Roberts is informing the Chlppewas that he is empowered by the government to offer each one a quarter sec tion of land and 525 per annum. The offer, which is accepted with great avidity by the Indians, is evidenced by a certificate, one of whicli has been forwarded to the Indian bureau. It reads as follows: Indian department, Washington, D. C, In dian Territory, United States of America: This is to certify that 1, Peter Dimond, have this day received from George William Rob erts this certificate entitling me to 100 acres of land in Indian Territory, Cherokee Nation, to be selected by the holder hereof, and the sum of $25 per annum. G. W. Roberts, Daniel Roberts, George Shapp, Marcus Lindsey, Chiefs of the Cherokee Nation. The matter is of course a transparent fraud. The names of Daniel Roberts, Georgo Shapp and Marcus Lindsey no not appear among those of the chiefs of the Cherokees. Roberts exacts from each In dian who accepts a certificate the sum of 25 cents for the seal thereon, and according to Dr. Hill's report has disposed of 200 of the worthless documents. The government has been requested to apprehend Roberts, and the law department of the Indian bureau is making an exhaustive search of the statutes in hopes of discovering some provisions un der which Roberts can be arrested.

Special to the Globe. Washington, Deo. 18. — The annual re port of the postmaster general and his as sistants has just been sent to congress in the shape of a bound volume of over 1,000 pages. It contains some curious facts, which impress one with the magnitude of the postal system of the country and indeed of the coui, try itself. It is quite astonish ing, for instance, to learn from the report that the number of miles traveled by the railway mail clerks during the year was over 96.000.000. equivalent to 4,000 times around the world, or a distance greater t.iaj that from the earth to the sun. The number of letters and pieces of ordinary mail matter handled by these clerks in that time was, in round numbers, 5,000,000.000. The number of registered letters passing through the mails in the year was over 11, -000.000, and the amount of money trans ferred throueh the mails in postoHice or ders was about 5125.000.000.

Pig Iron Reported Higher — Marked Decrease In Failures. New York, Dec. 18.— Special telegrams to Bradstreet's from leading business cen ters this week report in portions of the West and Southwest unseasonably mild I weather, which has resulted in bad roads, and of necessity at various points in whole sale lines there has been no special activity, but none has neen expected at this time. Merchants generally leel confident that the new year will bring a better demand, which fact imparts a firm tone to most markets. At Chicago business is now quiet and the weather is bad. The distribution of woolens and other seasonable articles has felt the declining demand most. The request for holiday goods there is said to be the heaviest for three years past. There are no features from St. Louis except the in creased firmness for pig iron, which is be lieved to promise an early advance in price. In the Northwest AT MINXEAPOLI3 ANT) ST. PAtTL the wholesale movement is in good volume. in the South dry goods have been pushed with a fair degree of success. In the East there are no developments of note beyond the advance in Glendon and A ndover brands of pig iron. It is in part attributable to the fa^t that they have always commanded SI per ton more than other varieties of iron. The demand for dry goods is for near-by wants only, jobbers and agents reporting a small volume of business. It is, however, better than a year ago and about equal to the volume disposed of in December, 1883. Cotton goods stocks at the East are rela tively small. Print cloths are less active, but tinn. There is no special change in the markets for raw wools. Prices are as firm as ever and holders expect them to be main tained or advanced. More woolen machin ery is at work than heretofore. The bread stuff market is weak and declining. An export demand of any amount for wheat may hardly be said to exist. TIDE-WATER PRICES are about 12 cents a bushel higher than a yearjago, while English wheat is selling but 1 cent higher. India and Russia are there fore making contracts to deliver wheat in the United Kingdom next spring and sum mer without serious competition from the United States. Hog products are dull and lower. Petroleum is quiet and featureless. Eastern pig iron is unchanged in price and demand. Kails are firm at 835 at the mills. The movement of grocery staples in re sponse to a demand for consumption is be low that of last year. Dairy products have siightly improved. Anthracite coal is be ing cut in price to some extent and is only fairly active. The production already equals that of ISB4. The total number of failures in the United States reported to Bradstreet this week is 217, against 221 last week, a decline of 4, and as compared with 300 in the like week of December, 1884,236 in 1882 and ICS in 1881. Thus continues the marked decline in the total number of failures weekly during the last quarter of the year as against 1884. The grand total of failures in the United States from Jan. 1 to Dec. 18 is 10,771. against 11,083 in a like portion of 1884, a deduction of 316. The totals for 50 weeks of 1883, 1882 and 1881 respectively were 9,591, 7,761 and 5.391. v- ham: fishing ax HOIIK. The Balsena Captures a monster "While Coming lulo Port, San Francisco Alta. The vessels of the whaling fleet from the Northwestern waters are beginning to arrive in port in rapid succession, fourteen of the blubber-hunters making port yesterday There are now thirty-one vessels en route to this port, most of them with fair catches, and they are all due within the limits of this month. Yesterday's arrivals were the steamer Balaena, Capt. Smith, twelve days from Ounalaska, with a total catch of 100 barrels of oil and 24.000 pounds of bone; the bark J. A. Rowland, Capt. Sharkley. twenty-one days from the Arctic ocean, with a total catch of (500 barrel of oil and 12,000 pounds of bone; the bark Hunter. Capt. Green, fourteen days from Ounimack Pass, with a total catch of 295 barrels of oil and 4,000 pounds of bone, and the bark Mary and Susan, Capt. Rogers, fourteen days from Fox Island, with 750 barrels of oil and 15,000 pounds of bone. The Ba- Irena had good luck all through the sesson, the consummation of it occurring Tues day, when almost home. She was about seventy-five miles north of the Golden Gate, wlnn a small waterspout a couple of miles to the westward betokened the presence of the huge game her crew had been chasing in the icy waters of the Arctic. A sharp chase of an hour carried the boats within striking distance, and the lapse of a similar space of time saw the monster a corpse, his life having been extin guished by a vigorous prodding with har poons and the injection of an explosive bomb-lance. The capture proved to be a sperm whale, a rarity in these waters, where the humpback and Cali fornia grays are about the only varieties found. He was a veritable monster in point of size, measuring 127 feet in length, and said to be the largest ever killed on the coast. Capt. Smith expects him to turn out over 100 barrels of oil, and the trypot3 of the Balaena will determine this question within a few days. The crew were in great glee over this unexpected increase of their "lay," and are anxious to put the huge trophy of their prowess on exhibition before mincing his blubber. With this view the carcass was towed into port intact, the task delaying the com pletion of the Balsena's trip as long as it I would to have cut him up at sea. The strange freight attracted much attention as it was hauled down the bay yesterday after noon, and scores of the curious visited it in small boats after the vessel had reached her anchorage.

William Pitt Lyiide, the Noted Mil waukee Lawyer, Dcud— Sketch of Ills Life. Thomas Clark or Superior Makes an Assignment-- A Wisconsin Em • bezzlor Caught. Senator Sabin on Minnesota. Special to the Globe. New York, Doc. Senator Sabin was in New York Wednesday and present at the banquet tendered by Mr. Winiau and his associates of the Staten lsland Improve ment company to President Garrett of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, who has rec ently consolidated the ritaten Island inter ests and is making the same the terminal for his New York business. The senator occupied a seat at the guest table which was assigned to the mayor of Philadelphia, who, I being absent, left his toast to Philadelphia without response, and on its being an nounced by President Wiman, calls were made by the assembled guests for Sabin and the Western terminus of the Baltimore & Ohio railway. Mr. Wnnan, president of the Staten Island company, introducing Minnesota's junior member, paid a hand some tribute to Minnesota and the West, which was substantially as follows: I have very great pleasure, gentlemen, in re sponse to your calls to announce the pres sence here to-night of a distinguished gentleman of the West a gentleman repre senting the great state of Minnesota, which is as largely, if not more so, interested in the development of this new railroad enter prise as any other section, being the largest wheat-producing state and having the most extensive milling manufactories in the world, and it affords me great pleasure to present to you Senator Sabin of Minnesota and ask you to drink the health to that great and growing state. To which Senator Sabin responded: Mr. President, I am sensible of the courtesy and honor you do my stale and myself by the very 

FLATTERING ALLUSION' and cordial greeting extended to-night. I am, however, as you know, the recipient of this favor as the result of the happy acci dent which detained me in New York to night, and I only wish that the accident might have occurred early in the day. and I been notified that a response was expected on this occasion, that I might, as my friends and neighbors have done, gathered my scattered thoughts to gether and carefully noted down a few impromptu remarks in which I might have fittingly expressed the appreciation which I feel for the complimentary allusion to the great and prosperous West, and es pecially the young: state of Minnesota which I have the honor to represent, and whose growth in the past has been almost phenom enal and whose future, in our estimation, is almost beyond the comprehension of even oar Western enthusiasm. This occasion, Mr. President is one in which the state of Minnesota and the great West mingle in en joyment and congratulation with you to night. The extension of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad to its terminus on an Eastern seaboard at one of the finest harbors on the coast marks a new era in the great subject of cheap transportation to seaports, a sub ject to which the productive and industrial interests of the great Northwest are turning their attention with renewed vigor and hope, and the extension of this great trunk line, which has been built and equipped and operated in the interests of the stock holders and business interests of the coun try instead of being built and operated in the interests of the construction company and • 

LOADED DOWN WITH WATERED STOCK and bonds for several times its actual cost and on which fictitious and enormous valu ations were created out of nothing, and which overburdened and oppressed produ cers of the West are paying from their hard earnings to self-elected railroad magnates and capitalists of the country, and in this connection permit me to say to the brilliant and enterprising young president of the Baltimore & Ohio railway that when this great work of supplying your missing link is accomplished, we invite you to turn your attention to that land of promise, the new- Northwest, and if you will drop us a tele gram over the lines of that other great cor poration of yours, which has also proved a potent factor in regulating other watered monopolies, we will without delay relievo you of the great expense and burden of the arduous labor and patient negotiation which has secured the consummation of the tor-. minal facilities which we celebrate to-night/ and cheerfully and thankfully join hands with you, and together we will join the head of navigation on the Atlantic with the head of navigation on the great Father of Waters in the midst of the most fertile and fair por tion of this fair land, and from which we will furnish you golden grain with which to till the miles of solid elevators which you expect will line your beautiful harbor, and when that auspicious occasion arrives the industries and people of the state which I am proud to represent will turn out ami welcome and banquet you, and to which feast we most cordially extend an invitation to you all.
