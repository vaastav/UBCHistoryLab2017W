The President's Message. The message is very long, but readable throughout. It is packed with matter In which the people are Interested?matter which by speeches and oiher deliverances the President has made of moment. Some of It is ripe for action by Congress, and action should be taken, while other por tions are for discussion, and should re ceive a good deal of discussion. Oar foreign affairs, the President points out, are in exce.lent shape. We are at peace with the world, and noihing threat ens a change in those fortunate relations. The reference to Secretary Root's visit to Mexico is couched In terms of warm appreciation of our southern neighbor, and the recommendation respecting Amer. lean representation at the Tokio exposi tion in 1011! should meet with the most cordial response in the way of a libera, appropriation. Congress should see that the greatest republic in the world makes the proper appearance at a celebration where all the world will be on view, and in a country strongly attached to us and to which we are strongly attached. The President gives his space largely to domestic affairs. Ills range of sub jects is wide, stretching all the way from the currency question?the most pressing of all our questions?to the campaign ex penses of political parties, which Just now is in the hands mainly of those with noth ing else to do. Except that the President is a man of serious mind, he might be suspected of quizzing the reformers by proposing that the government foot the bills of our national campaigns and keep its own account of expenditures. The suggestions as to the army are in the right spirit, but need working out. That establishment undoubtedly is lan guishing. and the wide advertisement of the fact discredits us in the eyes of the nations. But the fact exists, and unless in some way it is remedied we shall be discredited in our own eyes. As to the navy we have the most definite word in the whole message. The President wants four new battleships, and they should be voted. The cruise to the Pacific invites great attention to our sea power and how much we expect of it, and it should be made, and kept, equal to every possible demand. The President wants additional trust legislation, and argues his case very per suasively. He asks also for currency leg islation, though he does not go into the subject beyond the generalities of the day Perhaps he is wise in that. An elastic currency and an emergency currency are safe texts for use In discussing present conditions, but a law which will meet the requirements and at the same time safe guard values and business is something that must come from a conference of many men with many minds. The rresl dent is Justified In quoting from hla previ ous deliverances on both the trust ques tion and the currency question, and in doing so makes effective repiy to those of his critics who cliarge him with failure in the one case, and with responsibility for disaster In the other. At last we have a word about the tariff ?not as straight a word as the subject warranted, but sufficient to show that the President favors and expects revision, and that the time for it will come in the spring of 1909. Meanwhile, sentiment may be taken as to an income tax and an in heritance tax, as, should the country favor the one or the other, or both, the tariff will thereby be affected. Mr. Gor man's work in 1894 was rendered all the more abortive by the decision of the Supreme Court ruling out the income tax which he at that time had provided. First and last, tne President, as usual, has provided many texts for discussion! and all ot them, both in Congress and in the press, will be freely used. Bills and Petitions. Hills and petitions are now in order, and the prospects are that the record will be broken. Not only are there many new members in both bouses of Congress, all full of suggestions about saving the cquntry and anxious to redeem promises made on the stump, but issues are numer ous, and all of them tempt a new hand at the bellows. But no harm will be done. The more bills the merrier. Few are ex pected to become laws. The pigeonholes of Congress are capacious. Many am bitious propositions find their way to those caverns. Otherwise six years in stead of six months would be necessary to enable Congress to dispose of the business of a single long session. The rule "No flowers" still applies to the opening day of Congress. But that does not prevent the Speaker from receiv ing the customary bouquets. By not wearing a frock coat Senator Koraker once more gave evidence of a thoroughly independent spirit. . The District and Congress. Once more the District Commissioners lay before Congress their annual recom mendation Jhat the local appropriations be based upon business principles. They ask that In the allotment of the public funds, half fropi the Treasury and half from the local taxpayers, consideration should be given to the current needs of the municipality tlrst of all, and that the provisions for the large permanent works, which will benefit the residents of later generations, should be financed as are slmi.ar works in other cities. In no other way will it be possible for the District to grow in proper proportion, to develop harmonious.y, to meet its new require ments as they arise, and to provide ade quately for the future needs In advance. The annual report of the Commissioners is long and interesting. It embraces in detail all the items of municipal manage ment for the past fiscal year, and It dis closes In the main a satisfactory and wholesome state of affairs. In practically every department of the municipal organi zation, however, are to be noted the ef fects of parsimony, the direct results of the pay-as-you-go po.icy adopted by Congress several years ago and persist ently maintained! The District needs more school buildings, more policemen, more firemen, and better pay for these two vitally important protective workers. Its administrative forces are smaller than good municipal business requirements de mand. The various corps of Inspectors are Inadequate to cover the fields assigned to them. The truth is, the District has srewn faster tlM Congress has realised, or has undertaken to provide for tn terms of financial adjustment. The fact that this annual recommenda tion for tbsr&stabllshment of the District finances on a business basis has been reg ularly rejected from session to session does not operste today to warrant an other refusal of this reasonable request. The Commissioners have right and'logic on their side. They are backed by the entire community. They have in support an endless vista of precedents. Their proposition is sound. The Secretary of the Treasury wisely refrains from cutting the estimates submitted by the Commis sioners, passing up to Congress the whole budget with its involved issues of method and principle. If the recommendations are rejected and the estimates are cut It will have to be on the Initiative of Con gress. and with the houses solely respon sible for the results. Meanwhile it is gratifying to observe that despite the heavy handicap of the unjust and li logical financial conditions imposed upon the District. It has made headway during the past y$ar. That It would the more quickly solve the various problems which confront it, such as those which affect the public health and safety, if it were given a more adequate annual allowance for maintenance is perfectly plain. It cannot be expected to biiUd great permanent works on a cash basis, and at the same time keep up the stand ard of administrative efficiency, and the requirement to attempt this Impossible task imposed upon it by Congress is Flat ty to be deplored. The House and Business. Mr. Williams and Mr. DeArmond were doubtless sincere yesterday In objecting to the lodging of so much power in the hands of the Speaker of the House. But that was because of the Speaker's poli tics. Mr. Cannon Is a republican, and the leader of thp minority and his first lieutenant are democrats. Had Mr. Wil liams taken the gavel would Mr. DeAr njond have objected to the House rules? Hardly. Had Mr. DeArmond taken the gavel would Mr. Williams have objected to them? It is moat unlikely. The rules of the House, as we all know, are the fruits of a reform Instituted by a strong man. Thomas B.* Reed came to the chair at a time when the House, for years, had been tied hand and foot by a procedure which was discreditable to the body. Obstruction had become an art. and the dullest member could success fully practice it. A premium was put on talk, and business could be halted at any time by anybody. The Speaker was kept busy with points of order and parlia mentary inquiries, while the clerks' throats were tried calling the roll. It was that merry old scheme of how not to do it. Mr. Reed at the beginning of the Fifty-first Congress put an.end to the nuisance. He had seen it in operation and come to despise it. He thought the public welfare demanded a change, and ne made a change. Hs had studied the subject, and the rules he offered for adoption embodied everything nec essary for the transaction of business. The noisy obstructionist was deposed from power, and the House made the master of the situation. The cry of czar was raised, bat Mr. Reed did not wince. The charge that the House had ceased to be a deliberative body amused him, as well it might. As he knew, the House under the old rules had not been permitted even to delib erate. Talking against time is far from deliberation. A l%ss resolute or resourceful man would have failed, but Mr. Reed had both sand and sense, and wen. In the next House Judge Crisp, a democrat, used practically the same rules, and they have since remained in force. Mr. Henderson, who succeeded Judge Crisp in the chair, was no csar. and surely no man not playing politics can call Mr. Cannon a csar.' Tho House must do business. To go back to the old procedure would be a sort of crime against experience and common sense. But nobody thinks of going back to the old procedure. The proposition is Pick wickian. and has a smile concealed about its person. The verdict in the case of Mrs. Bradley may be regarded as something of a vin dication of Oklahoma's determination to have the unwritten law formally and respectfully recognlze'd on the statute books. A number of statesmen seem determined to do all in their power to counteract the pleasant, things that were recently poured Into President Roosevelt's ears by the reception committees. * . Stuyvesant Fish's enemies are still full of fight, but his athletic exploits make them chary about leaving the choice of weapons to him. It should be a matter of pride in pe rusing the message to note that previous messages have been found worthy of ?ncores. Now that ocean travel is at its mini mum there Is no longer enough advertising value in a record-breaking liner to make !t worth while. Overhead Wires for the Plaza. A suggestion that the street traction situation at the Union station be relieved, as an emergency measure, by the installa tion of overhead trolley lines, revives memory of Washington's long fight against the introduction of this "cheap and nasty" form of propulsion. The citi zens of this community have always been and still are flatly opposed to any less safe, sightly system of traction than that which, after many seasons of struggle, was finally installed here and now stands as an object lesson for the entire country as a type of the best attainable method of surface traction. Whether they will op pose the emergency proposition depends entirely upon circumstances. There will be no objection to the use of overhead wires to give street railway access to the station plaza provided the legislative authorization to that effect is directly coui led with and made an in separable part of the act of* Congress es tablishing the permanent system of tracks at that p ace. In other words, recogniz ing the acuteness of the emergency, the people of Washington, and doubtless their good friends in Congress who appreciate the necessity of maintaining the high standard already established after so much travail, will consent to the make shift method only on condition that its term of existence is definitely limited to the period necessary to complete the per manent arrangement of tracks on the underground-conduit basts, that arrange ment being enacted into laif In the same bill that carries the permission to install overhead wires. There wl"l be strenuous opposition to any move designed to establish the over head wires on the plaza by means of a separate bill, to be followed at some later time by the biij prescribing the perma nent routes. To separate the two meas ures will be to invite delay, to offer a premium upon the loading of the perma nent trackage bill with amendments such as have already caused postponement and are at this time promised, or threatened, by the advocates of the former proposi tions of a general character. The issue in this matter remains clearly deflned. Owing to the failure of Con gress to provide adequately tor the ac cewmoistkm of the public at the new terminal In the matter of street car Hues, the station la occupied before the car tracks outside of the building are ready. It Is clearly the duty of Congress now to repair its error as far as possible by hastening the enactment of the law which should have been approved at least during the first session of the Fifty-ninth Con gress. Any temporary scheme to lessen the public Inconvenience shoud be re garded merely as a phase of the general work, promptly to be undertaken and pressed to a finish, of insta.ling on the station p.aza a series of loops directly connected with the city's general system and operated by means of underground conductors. i A number of the members of the House of Representatives appear to like "Uncle Joe" very much, even though their poli ties prevents them from ever being re garded as favorite nephews. Predictions that Gen. Grosvenor will be forgotten are absurd. Even though the Congressional Record may be closed to him, the arithmetic is still open. * . . Of course young Mr. Hyde would not surrender a million dollars of insurance money voluntarily. But nobody cares a great deal about his feelings in the matter. When the "third term" Is mentioned It Is now necessary to study the remark to be sure whether it is intended as a com pliment or a sarcasm. In his indignation at the way some of the New Tork newspapers treat him Mr. Bryan may be tempted to start an Ana nias Club of his own. The President's tendency to increase the length of his message makes the ad vancing cost of white paper a more seri ous problem than ever. Postal savings banks would enable the village postmaster to become even more intimately acquainted with the affairs of his neighbors. Great possibilities before Congress in clude even those of launching hitherto undiscussed presidential booms. ? ? ?>?' ? 

SHOOTING STABS. BX PHILANDER JOHNSON. Forethought. "I have decided to give my husband something very inexpensive for Christ mas," she sai?, thoughtfully. . "Some simple souvenir of the day that will be cherished for its remembrance rather than for its value?" "Yes, that's it. Something that won't put,such a crimp in the family funds that -he will have to economize in selecting a present for me." "Do holiday recess of Congress." said Uncle Bben, "makes me think of what a lot of folks acts. Dey uses up so much energy mappin' out deir Intentions dat dey has to take a vacation befo" dey gits stahted." It Occasionally Happens. The statesman oft will cause distress By greedy depredations; Proprieties with him are less Than the appropriations. Progress Reported. "At least half a million dollars has been expended for that building." said the in dignant citizen, "and there ha; been no progresa" "My dear sir," rejoined Mr. Grafton B. Gay. "how can you ignore the fact that the expenditure of half a million la in it self. progress?" Refuge in the Abstruse. "Ethelinda seems to prefer the most classical pieces she can find." said the fond mother. "Of course she does," answered Senator Sorghum. "8ome people play the piano Just as some people make speeches?the more difficult and unfamiliar the subject, the less liable they are to be corrected when they make mistakes." The Sixtieth Congress. Old machine is running fine! Cheers resounding down the line! Used to look like 59; Now she looks like 00. Some were bold enough to say They pursued a restful way. That Is over. From this day They will work like 90. Heretofore two statesmen might Lose their heads and start a fight. After this they'll do It right. They will fight like 00. But with patriotic skill * They will pass each little bill That the voters hope they will; Yes they will?like 90! Currency Reform Prospects. From the Philadelphia Ledger. The advices which are being received from Washington concerning the subject of currency reform are about as clear as the minds of those from whom they ema nate. No J>etter confirmation could be had. U any were needed, of the remark which wan made in these columns a few days ago, that the average statesman's brain is a blank on thlB great question. The conclusion is reached thus early in the career of the session that there will be no financial legislation this year be cause the members cannot agree upon any one who shall be authorised to decide when an "emergency" Is at hand, be cause next year la presidential year and the democrats may make an Issue of such a law if the republicans pass it, and be cause?and because. Proving It.. From the New York Herald. Col. Bryan is running things to suit him self in Washington, and this will induce many to agree with him that the donkey is a fit emblem for latter-day democracy. Wires. From the Philadelphia Inquirer.' The air of Washington will be thick with wireless messages between the Cap itoi and the White House this week. But wires will be pulled. Just the same. What's a Motto in Cleveland f From the Cleveland Plain Dealer. The fact must not b. overlooked that for tossing-up purposes the new $10 gold piece has head or tail facilities that are not excelled by those of any other coin. ? Grand Larceny Panic. From Life. The right name for the recent crisis is The Grand Larceny Panic. Washington's Proper Place. From the Baltimore American. Today Washington will again have the center of the American stage. Loeb's Rubber Stamp. From the Colombia State. Secretary Loeb must have lost the rub ber stamp which reads: "Mr. Roosevelt stands Just where he did on the night of the election In 1904." Partners. From the Baltimore Sun. t J. Pierpont Morgan has a new Job as assistant to the President. Persistent From the New York 8un. Mr. Bryan is well pleased with the democratic donkey. A ''patient" and a "persistent" animal. It has to be to carry him. New York?WASHINGTON?Paris. Christmas Cards, Booklets, Calendars and Diaries?Main floor, G street.
