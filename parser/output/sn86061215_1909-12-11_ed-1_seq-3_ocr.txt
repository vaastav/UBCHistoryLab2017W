PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Taft's message is a plain, business-like document, concise and to the point and easily understandable. The president sees the necessity of economy in expenditures, of striving for a surplus instead of a deficit, and it will be agreed that this is a laudable im. The tariff matter Is not approached with a chip on the presidential shoul der, as this questloi is frequently ap proached. The tariff question was de cided at the last session and is not up for consideration before the present congress. The president's discussion of the subject is confined to a statement of his plan as regards the work of the tariff commission empowered under the present law, and what other future steps will be taken with reference to Dr. Shailenberger The Regular and Reliable Chicagc Specialist, who has visited Ottumwa since 1903, wil be at Ottumwa, Ballingall Hotel, Tuesday, Dec. 14, 1909 (One day only) and return every 28 days.

DISEASES OF MEN AND PRIVATE DISEASES A SPECIALTY this question are explained in the statement that "if the facts secured by the tariff board are of such character as to show generally that the rates of duties imposed by the present tariff l&w are excessive under the principle of protection, I shall not hesitate to invite the attention of congress to this fact and for the necessity of action predicated thereon." Until such inves tigation iias been made and the facts are at hand, the president believes the tariff question should be let alone. The president believes the postal savings bank practicable as a substi tute for the plan attempted by some of the western states of guaranteeing bank deposits, in which he sees the "seeds of demoralization to conserva tive banking, and certain financial dis aster.'' He favors a federal board of health and sees no reason why such an agency should not be as successful as the department of agriculture has been, though the states now have state agricultural boards that bear the same relation to the federal depart ment as the state boards of health would bear to a national board. Changes in judicial procedure and in the method of issuing injunctions in labor disputes are urged and plans are suggested by which such reforms may be accomplished. Taken as a whole, the recommenda tions cover a range sufficiently wide to give congress plenty of work to do, without taking into consideration the questions the president states he will deal jvith in future messages. 

WEIGH YOUR PACKAGES. Postmaster Nimocks has a communi cation in today's issue of the Courier which should command attention. He states that unless packages are fully stamped they will not be sent from the. Ottumwa office until after the Christ mas rush is over. Most of the Christ mas packages come under the postof flce classification of merchandise, the rate for which is one cent an ounce. This must be paid in full, otherwise the package is not mailed from the of fice .until a card has been sent to the person to whom the package is con signed and postage is returned tor the full amount. The due postage privi lege is not extended to packages and the postmaster is not permitted to al low mail matter ot this character to leave the office where it is mailed tor delivery until the postago is paid in full. All pa k..ges are weighed at the Ottumwa office, and unless they are fully prepaid they are not sent out. in the mails. It is to the interest of per sons sending Christmas packages through the mails to make sure that the postage is sufficient. If they fall to do this it is practically certain that the packages they mail will not reach their destination until after Christmas. WATER POWER WASTED. The Des Moines Capital, which has been enthusiastic in its advocacy of the improvement of the Des Moines river with a view to making the stream navigable, culls attention to a statement made by Major Riche,re cently regarding the valuable water" power of. the river, which is now wast ed. The Capital says. Major Riche in his talk before the Greater Des Moines committee a few days ago made the surprising state ment that the Des Moines river lias a fall of three hundred feet between the city of Des Moines and the point where the Des Moines empties into the Mississippi. Such a fall means that there are many' valuable water power sites going to waste. Every wheel in the Des Moines valley ought to be turned by power furnished from the Des MJoines river. The proposed government survey will not. only tell whether or not the river can be made navigable, but it will disclose the best sites for dams. Any way it is taken, good is to come out ot the present in vestigation in relation to the Des Moines river. Major Riche's recommendation, as the result of thu preliminary investiga tion, made last summer, calls for the surveying of the stream by the gov ernment. If favorable action is taken on this recommendation and the gov ernment comes into Iowa to do this work, the state should study means of co-operating with the government in the improvement and do its part in a work that means much to Iowa. The government engineers in charge of the Panama canal construction have reported that five miles of the canal have been opened to navigation and speculation has been aroused as to the probability of opening the completed canal for commerce at an earlier date than has been planned. This probabil ity should show congress the necessity of doing something for our merchant marine. The opening of the Panapid, canal will be a great boon to com merce, but America will not secure her fair share of the benefit derived from this great engineering task and from, its enormous expenditure unless more ships flying the American flag are available for the trade which \vill flow through this new waterway. President Roosevelt urged upon congress the necessity of passing a ship subsidy bill and President Taft makes a sim- tions by congress. Police Judge Morrissey calls the at tention of the city council to the nec essity of putting the prisoners In the city jail to work. The city, he says, has been buying crushed rock, while men have been taking it easy in the city jail.

The latest survey from which figures can be compiled, the dispatch says", shows that peers of all parties hold 16,411,986 acres, or one-ilfth of the en tire area of the united kingdom. And the peers who defeated the budget are shown to hold together 10,978,979 acres of this total.

Two of the three foremost brewers, Lords Hindlip and Kenmart, own 81, 000 and 140,000 acres respectively.

CHERRY DISASTER Human Life Held Too Cheaply. (By R.' Williams.) 5 •{..}. 4..j. 4.4, 3.,j. ,3, ,5, Editor of the Courier:— Just at present the eyes of the world are attracted to Cherry, Illi nois, and from what we can learri of the disaster through the. public press, three hundred lives were snuffed out, the result largely of pure carelessness. This disaster could have been avoided had the proper precautions been used and better safety guards been put around the men for protection. In the first place, the mine was very dry, and all the timbers around the bottom of the shaft, as well as the timbers in the main entries, were dry pine tim ber, like tinder to catch fire as it were. It is evident the man in charge of the burning hay was radically in competent as to his duties. Instead of running the car along tlie main en try with his load of flrfe in an attempt to dump it into a pool of water, he should have sent it up on top, from whence it came. In a case of this kind delays are dangerous a fool should have known, but it seems he didn't, hence as the result of careless ness we have the above disaster con fronting us. It is a deplorable one. It seems to me there is a good opportun ity for legislation in regard to the per sonal safety of men who work under the ground for a living. The quantity of ljay or dry material allowed in a mine at any one time should be lim ited to a certain amount and above all put men in charge of handling those things that are competent men with brains also a method of lighting those fire traps as it. were, should be provided by law. ilasr recommendation. Consideration tlieless the men (breadwinners ot fam should be given to these recommenda-1 ilies) are gone and eighty unborn chil enough work on the rock pile to keep them all busy, let them be put to work cleaning the streets for the Christmas shoppers. A cable dispatch from London which shows the amount j&f land owned by the members of the house Of lords bears eloquent testimony to the reason for the rejection of the budget by that body. It has been determined that not one of the lords owns less than a thousand acres of land. Twenty-three members own more than 100,000 acres each. Most of the others reckw their If I understand the«word torch, it means something more than an ordi nary light 011 top of a man's head. It just simply means a large naked light and in this case very carelessly han dled. This should be regulated by law, for it. is evident that •had the electric light that was put in for illum inating purposes been in use this acci dent would not have occurred. Never- dren will never know their lathers. It matters not how well they are provid ed for, the head of the house.-the one who was looked to for the. necessities of life, can never be replaced. They are gone to the land from whence none return and con only be cherished rvrtv MWA coxnxcEH 111 memory. In conclusion, I want, to say that -it is worse than useless to dwell upon this terrible disaster. What is needed now is to make the above disaster a turning point to bring about such re forms in mine management as will go far towards making such horrors impossible. In this case we are told that this mine had all the latest appli ances. but if so they failed utterly at

Ottumwa unionists and their friends enjoyed a love feast last night in the Ottumwa Trades and Labor assembly hall. John P. White of Oskaloosa was the chief speaker. The meeting was the initial one planned for the win ter months, and it was a success in every way. A. D. Watson, chairman of the entertainment committee, who presided, said the object of the meet ing was to get together for mutual benefit and good times, and the pro gram that followed was true to tlie object. All had a good time and thus were mutually benefited. Aside from Mr. White, short talks were made by W. Kitto, F. A. Ehrmann, George Bliss and W. C. Minnick. Mr. White extolled the virtues of organized labor, and in referring to the recent mine disaster at Chervv, Illinois, said that the laxity of laws was responsible, and that the catastrophe could have been averted if a second opening in the mine had been provided. The Schu bert orchestra played throughout the evening, and refreshments were served. Mr. White is a fearless exponent of unionism and his long service in the ranks ot organized labor as president, of the Iowa Mine Workers and vice president of the national Mine Work ers the largest union organization in the world, fit liim well to talk on any subject pertaining to labor. The Trade Union Movement. Mr. White opened his address by telling of the good wnl the members of his organization had for Ottuinwa and her laboring people. The aim and struggle of the trade union movement declared the speaker, was for higher ideals- He said one ot the objects of unionism was to alleviate the suspi cion that has been cast on it by the corporations and enemies of the move ment, and that it had passed the ex perimental stage. Mr. White's thoughts the very moment when most wanted. If that life-saving equipment had been available if the electric lights had not been out of commission, but had been there for the men to use (instead of the naked' torch which was an invita tion to a conflagration), and, finally, if an ample water supply had been pro vided for .iust such emergencies, the story would have been far less of a tragedy, and there would not have been a village full of weeping widows and orphans. It is a self-evident fact that human life is held too cheaply in our mines, and the humble heroes ot Cherry, manv ot whom saved the lives of their comrades at the cost of their own lives, will not have died in vain, it their sudden taking off arouses the country to the need ot such reforms as will afford the greatest protection to miners in the future.

That President Taft ib going to make appointments of northern ne groes to office rather than southern ones is tho information which hat. been pretty thoroughly disseminated among tlie colored politicians of W abh ington and elsewhere. The pieside.u has talked over his ideas about the appointment of colored men to office with some of the leading men of the race, and he has signified to them his inclination to give recognition to tho negro voters in northern states where there are large populations of blacks. As the result of this policy, it is ex pected that the negroes in the south who are holding important offices will, as their terms expire, he displaced for the most part by whites and in turn recognition will be given to colored men in the north. In the entire south, there are not manv offices held colored men, that is, offices of importance and influence. Tlie list of colored men holding im portant offices the south under tho fedef-al government includes the fol lowing: Robert Smalls, collector of customs at Beaufort, South Carolina. Henry A Rucker, collector of inter nal revenue at Jacksonville, Fla. Joseph Lee, collector of internal rev enue at Jacksonville, Fla. Martin H.

JOHN P. WHITE DELIVERS ADDRESS!LoWestPriceFlour ON THE TRADES UNION MOVEMENT went back many years to the struggle of labor for recognition and how the galling oppression had been lifted by the trades union movement. With the installation of labor saving devices, and the ingenuity of men, the laborer must adjust himself for every condi tion. Mr. White told of the intense in terest in the affairs of labor and in stead of being afraid to let the public know, the crafts were taking all into confidence and thereby eliminating suspicion. He told the work accom plished by the trades union move ment The flght against child labor, whereby the children, Instead of toil ing in the mines and workshop were playing 011 the school grounds, was pointed out as was other fruitful re sults obtained by the trades union movement. He told of his visit to tho international Mining congress in Eng land as a representative of the United States, and stated that the same trades union movement had extended across the ocean with the same ideals the betterment of mankind. He eulo gized the men who had forty years been fighting for the betterment of labor. The Cherry Disaster. The laxity of the laws, Mr. White said, was responsible for the appalling sacrifices of labor. The mine disaster at Cherrv, 111., where H00 men lost their lives was referred to by the speaker as -descriptive of how cheap ly human life was held by capital. "The protection of the laborer Is one of the present day problems of the trade union movement," said Mr. White, "and the Cherry disaster showB the shocking conditions under which miners worked. This horrible catas trophe might help tho laboring men to secure something to prevent further disasters. Had there been a second opening iu the Cherry mine, those poor men could have come safely out." The relation of the miner and oper ator in this state, Mr. White said, were fnendlv, but this condition did not ex ist. in ail states, and he cited Colorado, Alabama and Tennessee, and how the governors in their high offices had rul ed against the miner. He touched up on the switchmen's strike and hoped that they would be successful in their flght for higher wages. It. was regrettable that Mr. Moore head ot Des Moines, national organ izer of the Carpenters and Joiners of America, could not be present, as well as Miles Crawford and Edward Blako, who were unable to be present on ac count of illness. This left only one visiting speaker on the program, Mr. White, but his inspiring and helpful message to the unionists made lip for the absent, numbers of the program. selection of a successor to W.
