The "president's message sent to coBzress last' monday is too long for our oolumns, though it makes sight of good reading for any one wlshlnz information In reference to all departments of our good govern- Bjeat. It is a much more volumin ous document than his last annual message and bears upon almost every tooic claiming attention by congress. The president's views , iu reference to the unlimited and compulsory m if nave ' ot silver are not in exact accord with his party, particularly ta the West, but he gives his rea sons therefor in pointed terms, that Impulses oue with the honesty of hi convictions. Upqn the whole wc do not recollect a more statcmens tike document of the kind than the taessaere of President Cleveland. Tho Globe-Democrat, notwithstand Ing its intensely partisan character, makes favorable mention of tue mes or'. nd winds tiD its review as follows: ' "The message touches upon al . most erery question of broad na tional concern. While the recom mendations and suggestions will not all command and unqualified favors of the people, it must be acknowl edged that most of them arc sound and worthy of the action . of congress. The document certainly gives much valuable information on questions with which ever eood citizen should feel aa interest." A wspaech from Glasgow to the Globe ' Democrat says that the safe . at Essie's mill in that place, was broken open last Friday night and burglarized of $80 :. and Ollie Thix- ton. a yonng mulatto, had been ar tested for the crime, and had con fessed his guilt, that the mother of the boy, when learning mac circum stances implicated her son as the iiifof . Ait.ed the officers all she . could, that she applied the hickory so readily, and to such good pnrpo mes tint the vounff scamp became quite willihg to produce nearly a the stolen money. ' WtiAT TUK
