We have received an interesting cor respondence from Kentucky, but too late for insertion in this issue. ..... There is a chance now fcr somebody to make a few dollars by securing the contract for repairing the room under the old clerk's office. See advertisement headed "Sealed Proposals." Neither the Herald nor the Trionne had the nerve to "tackle" the President's Message. But after .a little reflection, the Herald managed this week to electri ify its subscribers with the Governor's Message. We were in error in stating that Frank Mitchell A Bro., of St. Louis, had suf fered loss by a recent conflagration, as we learn from A. M. Scott, Esq., of that city. It was another firm, with a name almost similar to that of the Mitchell brothers. We have a rather juicy communica tion from New. Lexington, which will appear in next issue. It, with other in interesting matter, was crowded out of our columns this week by the P. M., which, as will be observed, occupies nearly the whole of our second page. The burglar who carried off Mr. Le vi's goods, has i ot been captured, as was stated in a telegram from Lancaster to the Cincinnati Commercial. Herts, the person whom Mr. Levi suspects with the theft, ia still at large, and any in formation concerning his whereabouts would be very thankfully received by Mr. L. Congress convened on last Monday, and had scarcely got through with lis tening to the President's Message, when the financial question was sprung, and the indications now are that it will be the occasion of unusually lively debates during the session. The Mite Society of the M. E. Church will be entertained at the residence of Mr. O. T. Mohler on Wednesday eve ning, December 16th, by Mrs. Mohler, Mrs. M. Bugh, and Mrs. J. G. Kelso. Come, everybody, and have a good time. Three prisoners St. Clair, McMannis and Blackburn broke jail at New Lex ington, on Sunday evening last, and two of them made good their escape. But the third and most interesting of the pets Blackburn was collared by Mr. Porter, the jail guard, who happened to "come around" just as the boys had emerged from the hole they had dug through the prison wall, and taken back and supplied with a new set of jewelry. Died At his residence in this place, on Wednesday morning, the 9th instant, Jacob Burgoon, aged about 88 years. The deceased came to this county from Frederick county, Maryland, in 1825, and located in the vicinity of St. Jo seph's, where he resided until a few years ago) when he removed to town, where he departed this life as above stated. He led a quiet and upright life, was universally highly esteemed in the community, and his death is lamented by a large circle of relatives and ac quaintances. A battle occurred at Vicksburg, Miss., on Monday last between large forces of whites and negroes. The latter were re pulsed with a loss of about seventy. The whites lost one killed, and two wounded. A dispatch says: The attack was made for the purpose of reinstating Crosby, Sheriff, who was requested to resign be cause he had not given any bond. The negroes in the country are reported burning dwellings and cotton gins. At last accounts, however, all was quiet in the city, bat the inhabitants generally, were in arms, ready for any further "emergencies." Died, December 7, 1874, in Clayton township, i'erry coonty, Ohio, i-lixa beth, wife " of Jaa. W. Moore, and daughter of William and Mary Wil liams. She was born December 9th, 1849 was married December 22, 1870, joined the M. E. Church, February 1872, an der the Pastoral labors of Rev. Wm. S. Benner, and shortly after professed faith in Christ, and told her husband, she knew that her sins were forgiven. Her lut illness was brief but severe. A few minutes before her death, (having been In aomatoee state for a time,) she opened iter ya, wits a heavenly smile and passed away. Her end waa peace, , H. Z.

During the same year the expenditures were $992.06 leaving a net balance in favor of the Fair of $1511.19. This was good work. The Board re cently elected is composed of good ma terial but it will have hard work to equal the results of the last year's effort. It is already intimated that the new Board will give an entertainment at the city hall which will I worthy of pat ronage and that as the proceeds of last February's effort resulted in a net in come of $27730 nothing short of an ef fort to raise $300 this winter ull ratisfy the ambition of the new Board. This shows the right kind of pluck. Any laudable endeavor to lift the Fair Company out of debt will receive the hearty approval and support of the com munity at large, for after all it is the capacity of the community to sustain the fair in Somerset that is on trial and not the capacity alone of the Directory and officers. Ten or fifteen of our young melt have expressed their readiness, if called on by the proper authorities, to furnish an entertainment for the benefit of the Fair Company. Such an entertainment by our native amateur talent can be j made highly attractive with some care j in drafting a programme. I We hope that no pains will be spared in the presentation of the plays and the performances so that their repetition may rather be desired than ignored. In all the entertainments it may not bo well to leave out music both vocal and instrumental, nor the female ele ment on the stage. We have some ex cellent musicians who have already proven their powers to charm the ear, but we have also those whose presence on the stage hag not yet been greeted by a public audience. Let us hear them. And last, but by no means least, can we not have a series of lectures on var ious subjects of interest from competent persons who may be willing to aid the Fair Company? Surely we may if the proper steps be taken to this end. "American Clyelopsedla.' We have received the first three vol umes of this great American publica tion. This is the revised edition of what has formerly been known as the Xew American Cyclopaedia. It is en tirely rewritten by the ablest writers on every subject, and beautifully illustrated with engravings and maps costing up ward of $80,000. .The entire cost of the work will be upwards of $500,000. It is to be completed in sixteen royal octavo vol umes of eight hundred pages each. Nine volumes are now published. The re maining seven volumes will be complet ed one every two months. Those who secure this work will have st practical library worth more for practical use than many libraries containing volumes cost ing thousands of dollars.

The adjourned session of the Perry County Teachers' Institute will be held at Junction City, commencing December 31, 1874, and continuing three days. A suitable room has been secured, and present indications are, that the session will be one of interest and profit. Teachers, and all others interested in the advancement of the educational in terests of the county, are cordially in vited to attend. Ex. Committee. Mr. H. A. Schwartz of this place, is the agent for "our Fireside Friend," one of the most popular literary papers of the day. Every subscriber to the pa per gets one or more beautiful chromos. The premium chromos we have seen, and have no hesitation in pronouncing them charming, and of a high order of art. But as Mr. Schwartz lias these chromos and sample copies of the paper, for exhibition, and is also fully conver sant with all the inducements which the publishers offer to eubearibers, we refer the public to him, feeling assured that they will find in these offers abetter opportunity to invest a small amount to good advantage than has turned tip for a long time.

According to a decision of the Sup reme Court of Indiana on Wednesday, the passage of the Civil Rights bill will be necessary to enforce the mixed school system in that State. By an act of the Legislature in 1869 provision waa made for the education of white and colored children in separate schools. Suit was brought by a negro to compel a school board to admit his children to a com mon district school. One of the main points urged was that the statute of 1869 referred to was in conflict with the four teenth amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The court held that such amendment forbids any State from abridging the privileges of any citizen of the United States, that all the privileges of the school system of Indiana are de rived from Constitution and laws of that State, and that the Constitution of the United States has no force over such priyileges. The case will be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Helen M.
