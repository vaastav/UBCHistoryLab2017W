Washington, Dec. 4. The feature of the Benate proceenings was the reading of the president's message, which absorbed most of the time to adjournment. A resolution was adopted instructing the clerk to inform the house that the senate was in session. In accordance with the provisions of a resolution offered by Mr. Morrill and Adopted, Mr. Morrill and Mr. Saulsbury were made members, on the part of the senate, of a committee to wait on the president with the information that congress was in session. The senate took a recess from 12 :47 to 1 :S0 o'clock. When it was called to order the notifica tion committee reported that the president would communicate with the senate imme diately. The president's message was then pre sented, and at 1 :33 the clerk began to read it. The reading occupied an hour and twenty minutes. At its conclusion the message 'was laid on the table and ordered printed. At 2:53 the senate adjourned. IN THE 

HOUSE. The president's message was read to the house of representatives by Reading Clerk Brown. He began at 1:35 p. m. and con cluded at S: 15 p. m. Nearly every member was present, the only prominent absentee be ing Mr. Randall, who, after answering to the roll call, left the Capitol. The strictest at tention at the beginning of the reading was given by members on both sides of the chamber. The first subject to cause applause was at the conclusion of the paragraph dis cussing tne tariir. .Democrats, lea uy Messrs. Springer, Herbert and others, broke out into around of handclapping. It was of short duration, however, and did not cause the clerk to halt in his reading. Where the message touched on the dismissal of Minister Sackville, and said it was necessary to the dignity of this government to have "a new personal channel" of communication with Great Britain, the . house broke out m deri sive laughter, which was renewed when the clerk read the passage saying the British minister's offense took place at the crisis of a presidential election, and again when he read the reference to Minister Sackvillo as "the person." Interest in the message flagged when the reading of the recommendations of the various departments was reached, and members all over the house kept up a con stant buzz of conversation, visited one another and smoked and talked in groups behind the screens. When at 3:15 the reading was completed Mr. Mills offered a resolution, which was agreed to, referring the message to the com mittee of the whole and providing for its printing. The Louse then adjourned. 

INDIVIDUAL OPINIONS. At the conclusion of the reading of the president's message the representatives of the United Press attempted to obtain from prom inent congressmen their views upon the com munication. Many senators and representa tives declined to express themselves, giving as reasons that they had heard but portions of it read. As a rule the Democrats heartily indorsed it, while the Republicans could not find anything good to say in its behalf. A few of the expressions obtained are given below: Mr. Hoar About all I can say is that it embodies the utterances of a disappointed . politician. Mr. Sherman The latter part of the mes sage consists of a review of the work of the different branches of the government. There is nothing striking about it. The first part I did not hear. Mr. Cullom Of necessity he dies'ganie on his tariff views, and in his references to in ternational affairs runs into a great scold. Mr. Frye The only part of the communis cation which interested me was that refer ring to the fisheries question. I am now try ing to solve the problem therein, namely: The president states that there has been noth ing of moment occurring on that subject since March last. kWhy does he then so severely criticise us for not passing retalia tory measures? Mr. Manderson I was " not particularly struck with what I heard of the message. I can say, however, that if Mr. Cleveland will visit the northwest when he has more leisure he will find that oar farmers do not indorse his utterances on the tariff question. Mr. Cockrell I cannot say much about the message until I shall have read it over. Generally speaking, it impressed me very favorably. Mr. Ransom I think it was, like all of Mr. Cleveland's public communications have been, a very able and concisely framed in - strument. Mr. Teller I think that the first part of the message is full of spleen. There was no silver lining to the cloud that overhung Mr. Cleveland when he wrote it I do not believe the country is in so deplorable a condition as he would have us belive. As to the adminis tration of the different departments, I want to say in answer to the president that the postoffice department was never in a worse condition than it is in to-day. Mr. Sowden, of Pennsylvania (Dem.) The message is all right except the tariff portion. The farmers of this country in the last elec tion put a veto on the president's idea. They know that what betters the wage workers' condition enhances the price of their pro ducts, and they voted accordingly. Mr. Breckenridge, of Kentucky (Dem.) The president keeps in view that it is a fight between monopoly and labor, and he is on the Bide of labor. . Mr. McMillin, of Tennesse (Dem.) The president nun""" the advanced position he assumed on the tariff, and he is right. Mr. Weaver, of Iowa (Ind) The presi dent's position on the tariff is just the right thing, but I am sorry he saw fit to recom mend suspension of silver coinage. Mr. Crisp, of Georgia, (Dem.) I think the president gives a strong and correct presen tation of the Democratic view of the tariff Question. Mr. Blount, of Georgia, (Dem.) It is the ablest paper he has ever produced. Mr. Thomas, of Illinois, (Rep.) The style Is decidedly sophomorlc. No distinction is made between external and internal taxes; they are spoken of as a common burden. Taking the message as a whole, one is re minded of that beatific state of philosophy and purity in which a disappointed office seeker finds himself " when he contemplates the follies and frailities of mankind. It is really a pitiful waU. Mr. Dunham, of Illinois, (Rep.) It is a re hash of the tariff message that killed him. We look upon it as the vaporings of a disap pointed man. THE 

SPEAKERSHIP CONTEST. There are now in the field three open can didates -for speaker of the house of repre sentatives of the Fifty-first congress Mo Kinley of Ohio, Cannon of Illinois, and Reed of Maine. It is only within a day or two that Mr. Reed and Mr. McKinley have acknowledged themselves candidates. Now they are willing to admit that they are "in the hands of their friends," which is equiva lent to an admission that they will make the fight. The friends of the other candidates say that Mr. Reed is handicapped by the fact that he comes from the east. It was well enough, they say, to give him a com plimentary caucus nomination when the Re publicans were in the minority, but they do not think the Republican party can give the speakership to Maine under the existing political conditions. The contest between these candidates promises to be a lively one, and there are several dark horses in the field ready to gain and make the race if the leaders are crowded off the track. OIL FOR THE WHEELS OF GOVERNMENT. The secretary of the treasury has trans mitted to congress estimates of appropria tions needed for the government for the fiscal year ending June 80, 1S90. They ag gregate $323,407,488, which is $3,063,S05 less than the estimate for 1SS9 and $3,530,511 more than the appropriations for the current fiscal year. The estimates are as follows: Legislative establishment, $3,3Sl,9ti3; executive estab lishment, $18,955,081; judicial establishment, $430,000; foreign intercourse, $1,947,505; military establishment, $25,293,372; naval establishment, $25,103,028; Indian affairs, $5,475,410; pensions, $81,758,700; public works, $21,204,909; postal service, $4,303,414; miscellaneous, $20,856,385; permanent an nual appropriations, $108,091,055. Total, $323,407,488. FRESH FROM MR. BLAINE. The Star says: A Star reporter talked with a man who was with Mr. Blaine Sun day. He says that he knows Mr. Blaine has not yet received any intimation that Mr. Harrison intends to call on him as an ad viser. Mr. Blaine is as ignorant of Mr. Har rison's intentions as is any private citizen. His friends expect him to go into the cab inet; further than that none of them know. It is probable that he would accept an tation to manage the state department. invi- j Terrible Atrocities in Peru. San Francisco, Dec. 4. Mails from Peru bring stories of terrible atrocities committed in the interior by Indians. The Curate of Moyaro was shot and beaten to death with sticks and stones recently, and when his mother interfered she was shot and her head cut off. Another woman who tried to save her was killed. The bodies of all three were wrapped in hides and thrown into the river. At La Paz a riot occurred over an attempt to head a movement for Camacho, the revolu tionist leader. In indiscriminate firing by government troops 137 men, women and children were killed and sixty wounded. The Report Denied. Boston, Dec. 4. In refutation of the ca blegram published a few days ago as coming from Rome, stating that Cardinal Gibbons was instructed to congratulate Gen. Harri son on his election, on the ground that Cath olic interests in America would be safe un der his administration, a special cable, under the date of Dec. 2, received by The Boston Pilot, says: 'The Vatican to-day firmly de nies the report -relating to Gon. Harrison's election. The report, as reproduced here, produced a painful impression. The Vatican denies it, and declares that the pope never interferes in national politics." Uarry -rushing His Fight. East Saginaw, Mich., Dec 4 Thomas B. Barry says he is about to commence legal proceedings at Philadelphia against the Knights of Labor, through its officers, for defamation of character and alleged expul sion, and that he placed the matter in the hands of his attorneys Saturday for criminal action in the United States district court at Bay City against John W. Hayes, secretary and treasurer of the Knights of Labor, for violation of the postal laws in sending Barry a letter on which appeared, "Expelled O E. B." Financial Results of the Big Walk.

Francis Tumble ty, or Twomblety, who was arrested in London for supposed complicity in the Whitechapel crimes and held under bail for other offenses, arrived in this city Sunday, and is now stop ping in East Tenth street. Two of Inspector Byrnes' men are watching him, and so is an English detective, who is making himself the laughing stock of the whole neighborhood. A Whitechapel Imitator. Taunton, Mass., Dec 4. In the village of Whittenton excitement runs high over several assaults on women by an unknown man who, from his acts, has evidently been reading of the Whitechapel murders. The police have been on the lookout for him, and a large number of young men have been patrolling the ward for the last two nights in the hope of discovering him. A Talking Newspaper.

Newspaper Comment on the President's Message. GREAT MANY SHADES OP OPINION Some Say It Is a Breat Paper, and AY ill Inspire Kvery Header wltfi Profound Ad miration Oilier Say It Is Stale, Plati tudinous and Kxtremely Amusing. j Baltimore, Dec 4. The Sun says: "Mr. Cleveland writes with the authority and power of a man whose conviction are thor ough and whose information is full, and with that air of confidence which springs from the consciousness that the truth, like other great forces, continues to move on and grow, notwithstanding the efforts of heretic politicians to destroy it. Altogether the message is exceedingly full and well written. It is a fitting supplement to the able state papers President Cleveland has given the country, and of no public servant, in this generation at least, can it be more truly said than of himself that he has constantly guarded the rectitude of his intentions, main tained unsullied his love of country and with unselfish purpose striven for the public good." Regarding the message The American says: "The message lacks the vigor, spirit and in dividuality heretofore conspicuous in his official writings and conveys the impression that the president has suddenly tired of his duties and has relaxed his grip upon the helm of the old ship of state. He nowhere rises above the commonplace, except in his introduction, which is a labored, pessimistic wail over his defeat in November, and a despairing appeal to his scattered partisans to rally under the old flag of free " trade and save the country from imaginary perils not suggested by an existing condition." j Boston, Dec 4. The Journal (Rep.) says: "We grieve to say it of the president of the United States, of whom, by reason of his high office, it would be pleasant to speak ; with respect, but the earlier portions of this message are tinctured with a demagogueism which is unworthy of thechief executive of this great people, and which, so far as it is accepted by foreigners as a statement of facts, is untrue and libelous." The Herald (Ind.) says: "The message, in the consideration of controverted questions, has in it the qualities of frankness and cour age which have distinguished President Cleve land's entire public life, and it will be found to be throughout a statesmanlike as well as a patriotic document." The Globe (Dem.) says: "President Cleve land stands as the foremost representative of that fairer distribution of the products of labor which is the ideal and object of all labor's most intelligent friends and leaders." The Advertiser (Rep.) refers to the message a8 a "long and stale homily, a good portion of it in the vein of Herr Most," and says: "It scarcely deserves serious attention, except as being in itself the most striking indication of the national degeneracy and decay which it discovers." Chicago, Dec. 4. The Herald (Dem.) says: "There is not a passage in this important and significant state paper but impresses the country with a sense that Grover Cleveland, as president, was the right man in the right place." The Times (Dem.) : "Many millions of peo ple, reading this last state paper of Cleve land's, will find themselves deeply regretting the failure to re-elect him to the presidency." The News (Ind. Rep.): "None but a hide bound partisan can fail to be aroused to ad miration of the man who, in the hour ot political defeat, can still keep his rudder true and absolutely suppress all personal feeling in his last official utterance. If a Democrat, he must be proud of the rugged statesman ship and earnest striving for the best inter ests of the country which marks every line If a Republican, he can do not less than hope that his chosen chief may come as well out of the fray, with as heroic port and un daunted mien in 1892 as Cleveland in the closing days of 1SSS." The Tribune (Rep.) : "The message contains neither new thoughts or suggestions, except on the tariff question, where the president has, in the past year, made a prodigious stride from tariff reform to naked, absolute free trade. The president is bold, nervy, and desires at least one more round before he will acknowledge himself whipped." The Inter-Ooean (Rep.): "The message con trasts sharply with the policy adopted a year ago, when the president could think of noth ing but the tariff." On that question The Inter-Ocean comments: "That part of his message might have been written by Manton Marble, Joseph Medill, Henry Watterson or any other free trader, accustomed to think, pen in hand. In fact The New York World, Louisville Courier-Journal and Chicago Tribune have said substantially the same thing as one finds in this message over and over again, ana tney were stale oeiore tney said them the first time." Indianapolis, Dec 4. The Journal says: "The solemn and ponderous way in which the president begins by referring to the dan gers that threaten the government at the be ginning ot its second hundred years oi na tional existence, and then lapses into chronic platitudes about the tariff and surplus, seems like a great reach after something states manlike. It only attains to mischevious demagogy, for that is the size of his talk about the growth of classes, the gulf between employers and employes, the exactions of capital, the wrongs of labor, etc "In all this jeremiad about the decadence of patriotism and morals there is dot a sound principle nor healthy idea. No president has ever before so roundly lectured the American people for their alleged neglect of duty, or so plainly appealed to class interests and preju dices in supjwrt of a pot policy." Comments of the London Papers. London, Dec 4. The Post, commenting on President Cleveland's message to the American house and senate, says that if the Americans are really inclined to resume negotiations with a view to a settlement of the Canadian fisheries question they will find the English ministers willing to meet them. The Daily News says: "We would usuret President Cleveland's acrimony with refer ence to the Sackville incident much more if it were not for the fact that Lord Salisbury set the example Mr. Cleveland evidently possesses Salisbury's bitterness of tongue, but otherwise his message is a great docu ment." The Chronicle thinks that Mr.- Cleveland uses strong, but, nevertheless, true language on th6 subject ot protection. Milan and Natalie. Belgrade, Dec 4. Queen Natalie has received from King Milan all of the presents he formerly made to her and a grant of 1,000 000 francs, which remains at her disposal in the Bank of Servia. King Milan has ordered that she shall henceforth be known in Servia merely as Natalie de Ker.hko. A Fresh Stanley Rumor. Liverpool, Dec 4, Mail advices received here from the west coast of Africa say: A rumor has reached Bony, from the upper Niger, that Henry M. Stanley is proceeding at the back of the great oil rivers under the British flag, and tnat the natives are friendly. 

PHIL DALY'S - ADVENTURE. He Successfully Resists a Bold Attempt to Rob Illm In a Syren's Den. New York, Dec 4. Phil Daly, the well known sporting man and proprietor of the Pennsylvania club house at Long Branch, was shot and slightly wounded while resist ing an attempt to levy blackmail upon him at the house No. 406 Fourth avenue Mr. Daly has been residing at the Coleman house in this city for the past few weeks. He made the acquaintance of Addie Stanton, aged 25 years, a pretty woman and alleged dressmaker, who lived with Ella Hammond, aged SO, on the second floor of the house mentioned. He visited Miss Stanton several times, and on Saturday received a note re questing him to call at S o'clock Monday, which he did. He had $3,000 in cash and $30,000 in bonds in his pockets, which he had intended to put in a deposit vault during tho day. While conversing with Miss Stanton the folding doors between the two rooms of the flat opened and two men walked in. The larger of the two held a handkerchief before his features, drew a revolver and bade Daly throw up his hands. The smaller man made no hostile move. Daly rushed at and grap pled with the holder of the revolver. The weapon was discharged and the ball grazed Daly's temple and buried itself in the wall of the room. The shoebwaused Daly to re lease his hold upon his iSailant, who at once fled, followed by his companion. Daly started in pursuit, but by the time he reached the street the men had disappeared. Daly told a passing policeman what had hap pened, and went into a drug store and had his wound dressed. The policeman arrested Miss Stanton, and also Miss Hammond, who was found in another part of the house, and Daly made a complaint of attempted rob bery against them. Miss Stanton protested complete ignorance of any plot She swore she had never seen the two men before. She considered Daly a good friend, and had sent for him on a personal matter. She could not account for the advent of the two strangers. Miss Hammond was equally in nocent. Both were locked up. Several de tectives are searching for the blackmailers. A trunk found in the women s room, con taining a number of letters from men, was confiscated by the police. AUSTRIA'S ARMY. Russia and France Grumble, but Are Fow erless The New Rill Says Every Man Not Physically Incapable Must Rear Arms; j London, Dec 4. There appears to be a certainty that Russia and France have ex changed notes regarding tho provisions of the new Austro-Hungarian army bilL The situ ation is strained, but though the czar may be indignant at the increase of strength which the measure will give to his southern neigh bor, any protest he could make would be of little avail I The representations of Austria to Germany concerning Russian intrigues have had their effect, and Austria feels encouraged to aug ment her army. This can only be done by changing the terms and manner of service, whatever dis affection may result therefrom. There will be a great deal of murmuring among classes hitherto exempt from conscription; but the Austrian emperor naturally relies upon the support of those of the rank and file already compelled to serve, who will feel a grim sat isfaction at the inclusion of others previously free from service. The standard of height has been reduced, and many exemptions have been abrogated. This will add to the nominal strength of the army, but whether the element now in cluded in its ranks will add to its real effec tiveness is a question to be s eriously consid ered. The new regulations take in every man who is not physically incapacitated from bearing arms, and the many men of the middle class who in tho past have bought their freedom from conscription will be com pelled henceforth to serve or pay greatly in creased prices for exemption, a thing under the prevalent corruption in Austria not dif ficult to accomplish. It is the latter circumstance which causes the workiugmen to grumble at the new bilL The widely spread corruption which seems inherent in the Austrian empire renders it easy for those who have money to escape service altogether or to be detailed on merely nominal duty, and although medical students or only sons of widows, whose status is gen erally not too curiously inquired into may not so easily escape the dangers of war, it is only a question as to how many more florins they may have to pay. The purport of the bill, whether carried out mildly or severely, will be at least to in crease the efficiency of the navy, and it is undoubtedly Austria's object to increase her strength in the Mediterranean.

Curiosity Concerning Gen. Har rison's Letters. HE IS SEEKING INFORMATION. Lacking Facts, Indlanlans Interest Them selves with Speculation The President elect Is Endeavoring to Heal the Dif ferences In Several States. Indianapolis, Dec 4. Gen. Harrison, in his capacity of healer, has big business on hand, and he dare not leave it. Since he spoke so longingly a week ago about the good shooting there is at this seas.m of the year in the southern part of taa state, his friends have been trying to arrange a hunting party for his benefit. The plan was under the management of Attorney Frank Morrison, of the Louisville, New Albany and Chicago railroad, which is a thoroughly Republican corporation, and the proposition was to have a special train, conscript half a score of con genial spirits, and spend several days in the southern uplands shooting quaiL The invitation was seut to Gen. Harrison through law partner Miller, who returned a declination: "The general says he has engagements of the utmost importance next week. Maybe'he will snatch a day and run out with CoL Millard or some other member of the Indianapolis Sportsniens' club a few miles, but other sport than that he cannot hope for." What are these momentous engagements! The air is full of strange rumors. The im agination of the Indianapolis political gossip is fertile beyond comparison. An explanation is given here of the lively caucussing that has been going on in New York and Ohio between the Republican leaders during the past ten days. Such an unwonted fondness for conferences at so early a stage of a political game as tho pres ent is unusual1; and not likely to be mani fested except under the spur of a necessity Torced upon the conferrees. The necessity "arises, it appears, from letters the president elect has been writing. These letters have been addressed to Re publican leaders in these two states, and probably to leaders in other states also, and they set forth the anxiety of the president elect to act with perfect fairness to all fac tions in order to harmonize the party as much as possible at the very beginning of his administration. They request each person addressed to write to tne president-elect a careful statement of his views as to the situa tion in his state, and in effect are an invita tion for the leaders of the several factions to appear before the bar of the Harrison court and present briefs setting forth the argu ments in favor of their several sides of the case. The conferences consequent upon these letters arise out of the anxiety of each fac tion to tell the best possible story, and especi ally to have all the stories of its side of the case agree. How well these stories will work in influ encing the course of the president-elect is a question. Schoolmaster Harrison has some assistants traveling about the country who may be keeping their eyes pealed for bad boys, and their reports may have as much in fluence over him as the tales the boys tell on each other. But at any rate Harrison does not mean to leave any chance for the allegation that he has ignored any faction or failed to give it an opportunity to be heard. He will give them all a chance at the preliminaries, how ever severely some of them may be plucked in the final examination. The day's sensation here has been the re port that Matt Quay stole into town and out again without being caught at it. The in herently improbable report was pretty well exploded by afternoon, but it made a deal of talk among the politicians all the morning. It was followed by a report that James G. Blaine had come to town and was closeted with the presidout-elect. Some believed even that. "I'm always glad to have you newspaper men bring me the news," said Gen. Harrison, dryly, when the rumors were mentioned to him. "You have no idea what a lot of things about myself I never would know if the newspaper men did not tell them to me." Gen. Harrison has a good deal of fun with the newspaper men, especially with the new ones who come to town and hurry out to in terview him the first thing they do. The most interesting visitor to Gen. Har rison yesterday was Gen. Lougstreet, who arrived here from Atlanta. He was accom panied by E. A. Angier and A. Angier, and the party is visiting E. C. Atkins. They called upon Gen. Harrison and spent a short time with him. Last night Gen. Harrison dined with the southerners at the residence of Mr. Atkins. Gen. Longstreet is often spoken of as resembling Grant, and in nothing is the resemblance more marked than in the fondness for silence, and all attempts to get any significant utterances from him were dead failures. MR. 

BLAINE WOULD ACCEPT. So Says One of His Intimate Friends- -His Plans for the Winter. Augusta, Me., Dec 4. Mr. Blaine has re turned from his New York trip. He will start for VVashington about Jan. 1. As he has re-leased his elegant home in that city to Mr. Leiter, he will rent a modest house for the use of his family, and later will build another house, less expensive than the one he now owns. The statement that he will be come the editor of a New York magazine is pure bosh. He has for a long time contem plated an important literary work, and will undertake it as soon as he has the opportu t unity. It will be a book relating to Ameri can political history. One of Mr. Blaine's most intimate friends says that, while no formal offer has been made, there is good reason to believe that Gen. Harrison will first offer the place of secretary of state to the man who might have been nominated for the presidency if he would have taken it, and who is to-day the most highly esteemed Republican in the land; and, further, that Mr. Blaine, after much consideration, and after taking the counsel of several of the members of the Maine dele gation and other men in whom he has confi dence, has intimated to them that he would accept the secretary of state's portfolio if it were offered him.
