Fte Sh'ange Necessary In teal! ieniidiis Following aro those portions of President Roosevelt's meHSfrgo to con . gress upon subject especially Im portant to the west currency, Inland waterways, Irrigation and public lands. The president says: In mv message to congress a year ago I Bpoke as follows on tho cur rency: "I especially call your attention to tho condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose In aiding the enor mous business development of tho country, and wrthln 10 years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $33.08. For Bcveral years evidence hns been ac cumulating that additional legislation Is needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the defects of the present laws. "There must Boor. De a revision of them, because to leave them as they are means to Incur liability of busi ness disaster. Slnee your body ad journed there has been a fluctuation In tho Interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent, and the fluc tuation was even greater during the preceding six months. Tho secretary of the treasury had to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. "Even worse than such fluctuatoln Is the advance In commercial rates and the uncertainty felt In the suffic iency of credit even at high rates. All commercial Interests suffer during each crop period. 'Excessive rates for call money In New York attract mon ey from the Interior banks Into the speculative field. This depletes the fund that would otherwise be availa ble for commercial uses, and commer cial borrowers are forced to pay abnormal rates, so that each fall a tax. In tho shape of Increased inter est charges, Is placed on the whole commerce of the country. "The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system Is se- . rlously defective. There Is need of) a change. Unfortunately, however, many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because they are complicated, are not ensy of comprehension, and tend to 'disturb existing rlghtH and Interests. W"5 must also rule out any play which would materially Impnlr the value of the United States 2 per cent bonds now pledged to secure circulation, the Issue of which was made under con ditions peculiarly creditable to the treasury. I do not press any spec ial plan. Various plnns have recently been proposed by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and which certain ly should receive your consideration Is that repeatedly brought to your at tention by the present secretary of the treasury, the essential features of which , have been approved by many prominent tankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should be permitted to Issue a speci fied proportion of their capital In notes-of given kind, the Issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive tho notes back when not wanted to legi timate trade. This plan would not permit the Issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emergency presented by times of stringency. "I do not nay thnt this is the right system. I only advance it to empha size my belief that there Is need for the adoption of some system which shall bo automatic and open to all sound banks, so as to nvold all pos sibility of discrimination and favor itism. Such a plan would tend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which now obtain In the New arW market; for at present there Is too much currency at certain seasons of the year, and Its accumu lation at New York tempts bankers to lend It at low rates for specula tive purposes; whereat .at other times when the crops are being moved there Is urgent need for a large but tem porary Increase In the currency sup ply. It must never be forgotten that this question concerns business men gen erally quite as much as bankers; es pecially Is this true of stockmen, farmers, and business ' men In the west, for at present at certain seasons of the year the difference In interest rates between the east and tho west Is from 6 to 10 per cent; whereas In Canada the corresponding difference Is but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of course, guard the Interests of New York and Chlcngo bankers, and must be drawn from the standpoints of tho farmer and the merchant are less than from the standpoint of the city bankers and the country bank ers." T again urge on the congress tho need of Immediate attention to this matter. We need a greater elasticity In our currency; provided, of course, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by tho natlonnl author ities. Provisions should be made for an emergency currency. Tho emer gency Issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully pre scribed by the government. Such emergency Issue must be bas ed on ndeqtiate securities approved by tho government, and must bo Issu ed under a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issued when the demand for It was urgent, while

Your grorf r rcturni yont money If you don'l like it: we pay !"" securing Its retirement ns the demand fell off. It is worth investigating to determine whether officers and direc tors of national banks should, ever be allowed to loan to themselves. Trust companies should be subject to the same supervision as banks; legislation to this effect should .be enacted for the District of Columbia and the ter ritories. Yet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the subject can only accomplish a certain amount. No legislation can by any possibility guarantee the business community against the results of speculative folly any more than It can guarantee an Individual against, tho rj-sult of his extravagance. When an Individual mortgages his house to buy an automobile he Invites disaster; and when wealthy men, or men who pose as such, or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager to become such, in dulge In reckless speculation espec ially if it Is accompanied by dishon esty they Jeopardize not only their own future, but the future of all their Innocent fellow citizens, for they ex pose the whole business community to panic and distress. no ven no. The Income account of the nation Is in a most satisfactory condition For the six fiscal years ending with the first ..of July last, the total ex pendltures and revenues of the na tlonal government, exclusive of the postal revenues and expenditures. were. In round numbers, revenues, $3,465,000,000, and expenditures, $3,275,000,000. The net excess of In come -over expenditures. Including In the latter the $50,000,000 expended for the Panama canal, was $190,000,- 000 for the six years, an average of about $31,000,000 a year. This represents an approximation between Income and outgo which It would be hard ot Improve. The sat isfactory working of the present tar iff law has been chiefly responsible for this excellent showing. Never theless, there Is an evident and con stantly growing feeling among our people that the time Is rapidly ap proaching when our system of reve nue legislation must be revised. The Tariff. This country Is definitely commit ted to the protective system and any effort to uproot it could not but cause widespread Industrial disaster. In other words, the principle of the present tariff law could not with wis dom be changed. But In a country of such phenomenal growth as ours It Is probably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized so as to see that no excessive or Improper benefits are conferred thereby, that proper reve nue Is provided, and that our foreign trade is encouraged. There must always be as a mini mum a tariff which will not only al low for the collection of an ample revenue, but which will at least make good the difference In cost of produc tion here and abroad; that Is, the dif ference In the labor cost here and abroad, for the well-being . of the wage-worker must ever be a -cardinal point of American policy. The ques tion should be approached purely from a business standpoint; both the time and the manner of the chnnge such as to arouse the minimum of agitation and disturbance In the bus iness world, and to give the least play for selfish and factional motives.' ' The sole consideration should "be to see that the sum total of changes; represents the public good. This means that the subject can not with wisdom be dealt with In the year pre ceding a presidential election Inland Wntrrwuya. The conservation of our natural re-i sources and their proper use consti tute the fundamental problem which underlies almost every other problem, of our national life. We must main tain for our civilization the adequate material basis without which thnt civilization can njt exist. We must show foresight, we must look ahead. As a nation we not only enjoy a wonderful measure of present pros perity, but If thft prosperity Is used aright It Is an earnest of future suc cess such as no other nation will have. The reward of foresight for this na tion Is great and easily foretold. But there must be the look ahead, there must be a realization of the fact that to waste, to destroy, our natural re sources, to skin and exhaust th land Instead of using it so as to Increase Its usefulness, will result in undermin ing In the days of our children and the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to them am plified and developed. For tho last few years, through sev eral agencies, the government has been endeavoring to get our people to look ahead and to substitute a planned and 'orderly development of our resources In place of a haphaz ard striving for Immediate profit. Our great river systems should ho developed as national water high ways; the Mississippi, with Its tribu taries, standing first In Importance, and tho Columbia second, although there are many others of Importance on the Pacific, the Atlantic ajid the Gulf slopes. The national govern ment should undertake this work, and I hopo a bcglnnlifg will be made In the present congress; and the great est of all our rivers, the Mississippi, should receive especial attention. From the great lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should be a deep waterway, with . deep 'water ways leading from It to the east and west. Such a waterway would prac tically mean the extension of our coast lino into the very heart of our country. It would be of Incalculable benefit to our people. If begun at once It can be carried through In time appreciably to re lleve the congestion of our great freight-carrying lines of railroads. Tho work should bo systematically The new Pure Food Law requires every pat ent medicine manufacturer to tell just what dan gerous drug is in his medicine. Certain period icals.interested in patent medicine reform have declared that the formulas of many patent medi cines will have to 1 2 dunged before the manu facturers will dare co-.fjrm with this law. These periodicals also deck: c that the public wiil never know of these changes, and never know what these remedies formerly contained. This suspicion, however, cannot rest upon Rex all Remedies. You have absolute proof that Rexall Remedies have not been changed to con- form with the new Pure Food Law, because you knew the formulas of these remedies Jour years ago The Rexall formulas were nrocr secret. The thousand Rexall druggists have always known all the Rexall formulas and given them to every cus tomer who asked for them. No one Rexall Remedy was ever claimed to be a 4,cure-all" each of the 300 remedies is de signed to cure a certain human ill and does it. These 300 remedies were selected from among thousands because they were the most reliable and successful cures in the wprld.. Far from, wishing to conceal the formulas of these remedies, ive are proud to tell just what they are, and al ways l ave been. That's where the Rexall plan goes further to safeguard you than does the Pure Food Lav. Even now youll only know the dangerous drugs in other patent medicines, while you have always been able to know the complete formulas of Rex all Remedies ! The Rexall guarantee has been the greatest evidence of the sincerity back of the Rexall Rem edies. For four years Rexall druggists have offered to return the money to any one who brought back an empty Rexall bottle or package and said they were not satisfied. We, as one of the Rexall druggists, feel a gen uine satisfaction in having been able to supply this community for four years with one line of medicines which the United States Govern ment by its new Pure Food Law shows were always made right and sold right, and have de served every bit of the faith you have had in them. The Pure Food Law may necessitate changes in other patent medicines, but it only endorses Rexall Remedies. Afewofth 300 famous
