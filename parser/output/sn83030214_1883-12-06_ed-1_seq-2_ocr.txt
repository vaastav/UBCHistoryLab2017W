The present unsatis? factory condition of our gold and sliver coinage api?ci.i> so pronounced as to demand the serious attention of the Senate. Though nominally rep rc wonting the double Murninni, their relative pr?p^|^ii?l .aloe 1* a fiction too cr..** to endure; ami when tbe ll cl iou explodes, a* some time it must explode, tbe heaviest lo** will fall upon those lca*t able to hear it.

THE S1.N7.1MKNT IX WAU. flTRKB AND AMONG FED ILIUI. OFFICIALS. Gemini Kitisfaetion with tho .'resident's message was expressed In Wall Street yesterday. " Thero UX milling remarkably brilliant about lt," an officer or a prominent Wall Street bunk said, "but it ls financially business-like nnd sound." The remark fully expressed tha opinion of leading bankers and financiers. Thomas C. Acton, Assistant Treasurer of the T'nltod 8taass> auld: " I have uot hail tune to read tho message carefully, hut from what I havo road and from what I have seen In the editorial columns of THE TniniM. to? day, I am satisfied that tho message was a very good one." ILdmnnd I). Randolph, president of the Continental Vat-anal Hank, said thal ho considered tba message a l MBUfkiy liiisiiiess-like docinm nt, .'ind 1,1 this opinion John T. Agnew, vice-president of tin- ban!,-, expressed his hearty concurrence. " In regard to tho recommenda tio-is of the message about Nation.il bunk circula? tion," Mr. Ilatnlolph said, " If would be possible Unit a financial flurry in the riroet sight result seriously ir the baal- ihonM be allowed lo taha out circulation for !'ii | -r cent of the iii.iii;ct value of the hon.ls di-po-it.-.l for security.

II. C. Ihhaaetoek, of Winslow, Lanlor Sc Co., who is the riee-ftaaaaaal af tba First National Hank, oal.l the difference between the amount allowed banks on bonds securing circulation nnd that which i oultl bo obtained on loan of tbe same hoods In open market was preposterous. " Any one ean borrow within 't, ami exrcptlonably 2 i>cr ceut of the market value of Government bonds, be remarked, " but u National bank i i-i borrow of the (lovernment only 00 per tint of the par value of the bonds. Tho most of the .National banks of tho country are re?ponsibln on thetr own account, bul thia fact seems to tte forgotten. There ls no reason why the banks should not receive morn than !'0 pal I BUI of the fact* value of bonds which now are selling nt a lane premium. Thc stability of tho bonds ls au at-.sur unce against loss." A. M. Hutch, of Fisk* A natch, president of the Stock Exchange, said: "I have mad only the financial peri af the mnee/n, but this is conservative and pei factly sound. Bud deserves the Immediate attention of Congress, Ah to the iicriietuutlori of b-ink-note circula? tion, the neonunendanona of the President are very con sen ittlvo. I think there would be no risk to the Govern? ment In allowing the full market value of the lionds, but with a 10 per rent margin aud a 5 per ct nt redemption fund, in addition, tho Gftrr ernmeat certainly emla surfer bo loss. Hmo the resumption of specie psvmenis, the existing long dale lionds haw) not depreciated 3 per ceut from their highest prices. There would bo BO flurry lu the market which would remit In loss to the Government if the Presidents lOggeetton of til) per cent ol the mai ket value should be adopted." The comment* on the inesaugo amoug Ibo officials lu Ihe Federal Mudding were all favorable. Most of tl-. court officials hail read the message through, and ex pressed their approval ol the sentiments expressed, ono official, who would be affected by thc suggested chang.-, expressed himself as lu favoro! the ivetem of salines only as payment for tho services of the ofllci.ils under the DepartBseol of Ju 'icc None of the heads of omen would express their opinions or the reeoinnifndBtliMii affecting toe departments with which they were eon ioctl .1.
