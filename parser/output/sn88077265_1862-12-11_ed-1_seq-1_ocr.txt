Jtoardig by. the Day, Ve or Month S. Q. CASSEL, Proprietor ABSTRACT OF The President's Message to Congress. Organization of Banking Associations Recommended. Immediate Emancipation Discarded. COLONIZATION AGAIN URGED. Fellow'citizens of th Senate ' And House of Representatives : Since your last annual assem bling, another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed; and while it hus not pleased the Al mighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light lie gives us, trust ing that in Ills own good time and wise way, all will be well. The correspondence touching foreign ufFuirs, which has taken place during the lust year, is here with submitted, in virtual compli ance with a request to that effect, made by the IIou6e os Represen tatives, near the close of the last session of Congress. If the con dition of our relations with other nations is leas gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distract ed as we are might reasonably have apprehended. The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave trade has been put into op eration with iv good prospect ot complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of her Majesty's Government has been marked by a jealous respect for the authority of the United States, and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens. The convention with Hanover for the abolition of the State dues has been carried into full effect nm der the act of Congress for that purpose. Applications have been made to me by many free Americans of Af rican descent to favor their emi gration with a view to such coloni zation 'as was contemplated in the recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad, some from interested motives, others upon patriotic considerations, and still others influenced by philan thropic sentiments, have suggested similar measures, while on the other hand several of the Spanish American territories have protesti ed against tho sending of such colonies to their respective terri tories. Under these J rcu instances, I have declined to move aty such colony , to any State without first obtaining the consent of its Govt ernmcnt, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants" in all their rights as freemen. Liberia and Hayti are yet the only countries to which colonists of African descent from here oould go with certainty of being received and adopted as citi zens; and I regret to Bay that such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to emigrate to these countries as some others, nor so willing as I think' their in terest demands. . . , Our rotation's "-with European States remain uudisturbod, and with States of our. continent have im- iiroved, especially Mexico, Costa liea, &c. ' " The President speaks' of a fa vored project, the Atlantic tele graph, and extending tho Pacific line io connect 'with that being ex tended across the Russian Empire, thinks tho mineral raaourcosot'.the Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have v ten dency to, improve the revenue. Th.e condit'on of the finances of the country will clau.u your most diligent consideration. vTlie vast expenditutos incident to tho mili tary and naval operations required I (for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a promptness and certainty, unusual in mmiisr .circurajtitnies.. The :g flf,.tte wai however. ,ncreased '"disourSemeiifaTJ and the i made necessary, demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue. The suspension of specie payment by the banks made large usues of United States Notes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so econ omically or as well provided f r. It is extremely doubtful whether a i circulation of United States notos,! tayable in cin, and sufficiently j for the wants of the people, can be permanently, ucef'ully and ' safely maintained Is there any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wauts can be made, and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured ? I know of none which promises so certain results, and, at the same time, so uuobjectiouable, as the organization of banking associations under a general act of Congress, well guard ed in its provisions. To such asso ciations the Government might furnish circulating notes, on the ;-e;:urity of Unitel States bonds deposited in the Treasury. These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in appearance and security and convertible always into com, would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges. A moderate res ervation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and dis tribution of the notes, and a gen eral supervision of the system would lighten the burden of that part of The public debt employed as security. The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved, and the oegotiatiou of new loans great ly facilitated by the steady market demand for Government bonds, which the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is an ad ditional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight in my judgment, that it would recoti ciie, as far as possible, all existing interests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorgan ize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national circu lation lor the local and various cir culations now used. The President then gives a sunn mary from the Secretary of tho Treasury's report. e refers to the reports of tho Secretaries of tho .Navy ana War, ana says, though lengthy, they aro only brief abstracts. He says there is a decided im provement iu the financial condi tion of the Postoffice Department, compared with the preceding years. The Secretary of the interior re ports that tho public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. The President refers to bis E raanclpution Procl.utautiou of Sept. 22d, and nays, "that portion of the earth occupied by the people of the United -States is well adapted to he the home of a national family, but not for two or iuore.: In the Inaugural Address, I briefly pointi ed out tho total inadequacy of Dis union as a remedy for differences between the poople of the two sections. I did so in language which . I cannot improve. Physii cally speaking, we cannot separate, we cannot remove one respective section from each other, H or build an i.nipasttble-wa.U between. ihom," He then remarks at length, pu-the ditHculty of making uy uatiojual boundary Hue. .-..-. f The Prcsideut then supgosted amend meats to the Constitution, Congress concurring, to bo pro posed to the Legislatures' or Con ventions of the several States, iRtntwa . abolishing slavery before with their consent at any place without the United States. The President discusses these ar arge tides at some length, and asks if, then, for a common object, slave i j i which, if ratified by tbree-fourtliB of said Legislatures, to be valid as parts of said Constitution . The first article proposes that all compensation trom me uimea States. 2d All slaves freed by chances of war any time before the end of the rebellion shall be fori ver free, but all owners who had not been disloyal, shall be compensated. 31 Conjriess may appropriate money, ami otherwise provide for colo!i;zin ..,iiAnk,l rmnoAiiii property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done at a com mon charge? The President then say, this plan is recommended as a means not iu conclusion of, but addition- ial to all others, for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the Union. I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addres sed to the Congress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate of the nai tion; nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many ot you have more experience man . . 1 . I I . IV I in the conduct ot public affairs ; y'm L trust that i i view of the great responsibility resting upon me, you will perceive no want ot respect to yourselves lu any uudue earuestuess I may Beem to display. Is it doubfed then, that the plan I propose, if adopted would shorten the war and thus lessen its expen diture of money and blood ? Is it doubted that it would restore nati onal prosperity, and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we here, Congress and Executive, can secure its adoption? Object wheresoever is possible, still the question recurs, "Can we do better? Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress will be remembered iu spiteof ourselves. No personal significance or iusigub ficanco can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial, through which we pass will light us down in hon or or dishonor to the latest genera tion. . Wo say that we aro for the Uni on. The world will not forget that we do know how to savo the Uni on. "We, even we here, hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free, hon orable alike in whdfe we give and what we preserve. Wo shall nobly 6ave, or meanly lose the last, best hope of the earth. Other nieaus may succeed. This could not fail. The way is plain peaceful d uerous -just a way which, if fol lowed, the world will forever ap plaud, and God nust forever bless. 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN. The Bollmeyer Fund. We beg to inform our . readers that a tund is being raised by the Democrats and Conservatives of the North-west, for the purpose of erec ting a monument to the lamented J. F. Bollmeyer, late Edltor of ;the Dayton Empire, and for the support of his family;: We hope our friends will respond liberally to the appeal, and thus: 6how that they 'respect the memory ot the tnsu who bat. tied so nobly for the 'cause of De mocracy, even junto death, Sub- ascriptions wilb.be received by the Editor; at the Press . Office, and Messrs. Gilraom and Campbell, Ea ton, of .whom subscription. lifitB may bo obtaiued;; o: v.c. : - IvP ' vsi For neat and cheap job. Tvarlt, go to the Tress effice. ' . v ' TO READERS OF THE "DEMOCRATIC PRESS." Sirs, You may not have been at the trouble to look carefully into the real condition in which we are, placed by the present war, and its consequences. You can get a much better price for whatever vou may have to sell this year than you could for many years past, and you are therefore in a much better con dition to pay for your paper. But how is it with us? Ilaveyou thought on that question? We have fewer subscribers now than we had last year. We lost a considerable sum of money by the Tress last year. We now pay nearly twice as much for our food and clothing as wo did last year, and much higher for paper and ink. How then with a smaller circulation, and a much dearer paper to print ou are we to live and be honest? We cannot do t. There will bo a meeting held sjoii iu a central town, of the pro prietors and conductors of country weekly papers to fix a price at which the various county papers cau be sold in future. A few addi tional cents paid yearly by each of our readers will not hurt them, but will be much to us. If tho Dem ocrats of Old Preble, with their po tatoes, wheat, corn, hay, pork, but ter and wood at an advanced price will stand by and let their county paper suffer for want of a liberal. effective and generous support, let them do so we cannot help it. Our office books will show that we have done our best to serve our rea ders for eighteen months at a great loss to ourselves. We did thiuk that after tho unexpected triumph of the Democratic party at the late elections, many of them would come forward unasked to subscribe to the Press. We shall be compel led to raise the'prico of our paper in tho year 1863. All'who will pay us before that time will be charged the old price, namely, $1:50. All Persons Indebted to this Office, will please to settle up at hi once, as an oacx accounts are now being placed In the hands of the proper parties for collection,
