Old Santa's Supplies If Santa Claus doesn't find what he wants for his gifts in Es tancia this year, it will not be the fault of the local merchants. Anyone making a round of the stores and seeing the many dis plays of holiday goods could easily imagine himself in some of the cities of the east, rather than the miscalled "wild and wool y west. ' ' There will be no need this year of sending to mail order houses for holiday goods, as al most everything anyone might chance to want for a gift is to be had right here at home, where the quality as well as the price may be examined before purchas ing. Our merchants have good news for, our readers in the ad vertising columns of the News. Don't overlook this part of the paper. , rií'úüc Installation oí Officers.

In regard to statehood he says: "I advocate the immediate ad mission oí New Mexico and Ari zona as states. This should be done by the present congress. The people of the two territories have made it evident by their votes that they will not come in as one state. The only alternative is to admit them as two, and I trust that this will be done without de lay." On finance he says conditions are excellent. As regards corporations he re peats what he has said in previous messages, recommending partic ularly that railroad, telegraph and telephone companies engaged in inter-state business be puiun der the jurisdiction of the inter state commerce commission. On labor he says the producer should have a greater share in the wealth produced and that a pro per employers'liability law should be .pussed. Salaries of judges, he says, should be increased aud the su preme court judges salaries should all be doubled. Injunction abuses should be corrected. Control over great corporations doing an interstate business should be vested solely in the ad ministration of the department of the federal government. The conservation of national resources, especially forests, is insistently urged. This would aid in the protection of inland water ways, which should be carefully protracted and improved. He suggests also an improve ment in the secret service. He makes renewed recommen dation for postal savings banks and says it would encourage tariff and bring money out of hiding. He also again recommends the extension of the parcel post, es pecially on rural routes. The share of the national gov ernment in the board work of education has not received the attention and care it de erves and he v.-:: -.!mMds that this be re medied by adequate appropria tions. He urges that the census em ployes be placed under, the civil Service and commends the report of the director of census. ' He touches on the recent bu bonic plague at San Francisco and says it is highly advisable that intelligent action on the part of the nation be taken on this question of preserving the public health. On foreign affairs he says: "The nation's foreign policy is based on the theory that right must be done between nations precisely as between individuals and in our actions for the last ten years we have in this matter proven our faith by our deeds.
