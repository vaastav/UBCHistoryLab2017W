Joe McAuley, Assaulted by Tim O'Connors, in a Crit ical Condition. LATTER HELD WITHOUT BAIL Assault Made With a Beer Glass in a Cedar Street Saloon. TWO BOYS MADE TO STEAL. Usual Monday's Grist of Of fenders Before the Mu nicipal Court. Tim O'Connors engaged In ' an alter cation with Joe McCanley in a Salons at Cedar and Fifth streets Sunday night, After the fight was over, McCanley was in such a condition that a physician, who was summoned, found it necessary to take more than a score of stitches in Mr. McCauley's scalo. Witnesses of the affray say that Connors struck Me* Auley with a beer glass. Connors was charged with assault, but since his arrest McAuley's condi tion lias become so serious that the case has been continued until Thursday, and no bail was allowed, owing to the un certain result of the injuries inflicted upon the complainant. Made to Steal. Arthur Hanson and Eddie Johnson, aged eleven and twelve years, and John and Charles Johnson, aged fifteen and seventeen, are lads who gather coal iv the railroad yards while the coal is in transitu. Detectives Atmiu, of the Omaha, and Noble, of the Great North ern, arrested the boys yesterday, and took them before Judge Twohy. They told the court that their parents made them "swipe de coal." Arthur and Eddie, who worked the. Omaha, and Johu and Charles, who were so bold as to attempt to rob the Great Northern, will be tried next Thursday. A Police Haiti. Minnie Baldwin's house at 320 East Fifth street was raided Sunday night, and some gentlemen and their compan ions gathered In. Mis.

Frank Haraff. a young man who lives out mi West Seventh street, was ar rested yesterday on the charge of as saulting William Pinirer some six weeks ago. Lint Bahe captured Haraff not far from his house. The police say that Haraff has been dodging arrest ever since the offense was committed. ST. PAUL MORALLY And Religiously Considered by the Commercial Club. It is a prevalent impression among many that the surroundings and influ ences of a city are vicious, and that lo dwell therein exposes ths young, par ticularly, to more temptations than else where. There is in metropolitan cen ters more crime than elsewhere, be cause there are more people than in sparsely settled areas. Human nature, however, Is the same all the world over; if there is In cities more crime, there is also more virtue, and proportionately more of the latter, because of the various civil and re ligious agencies to advance the public good. For years this city was an outbost of civilization, but as settlements extended to the Northwest it assumed a different aspect and has changed very much for the better, until now its citizens claim with pride that it is as free from vice as any city of its size in the country. Not that perfection has or ever will be reached, but vice is well under control and not so glaring. The two widely known pool rooms have been permanently suppressed, and all laws relating to dissipation are, owing to public sentiment, more strictly enforced. People here have their various circles of frieuds and acquaintances, and pro miscuous gatherings such as occur in smaller daces are almost unknown. The moral agencies are many; they aim to reach the young and those most subject to temptation; those not fre quenting churches, the poor, and es pecially girls and women. They are managed by noble, generous hearted and charitable men and women. The influence of the church is greater than it has ever been, and its growth is more than keepiugpace with that of the city. Not only have graceful and im posing edifices reared their spires heavenward in our wealthy districts, but also in the various outskirts a large number of modest edifices nave been erected. The different denominations are work ing In pleasing harmony, as was shown a short time ago at the Mills union re vival meetings held at the Auditorium, when ministers of all denominations addressed the farewell gathering. The city is honored by the presence of many earnest, eminent divines, and church services are made more Inviting to many by the rendition of the highest class of music by competent musicians, and strangers are cordially welcomed. So that, from a moral and religious standpoint, it may be said that St. Paul is as desirable a place iv which to live as any city in the country, and more so than many, and that its advantages more than overbalance its disadvan tages as compared with suburban or country life. Patience Is commended as the highest' form of politeness. Dr. Price's Cream Baking Powder as the purest and best leavening agent. FAVOKB CO-OPKRATION. Prof. Folwell Makes an Instruc- tlve Address. One of the ablest scholars in the Northwest, William W. Folwell, pro fessor of political science at the state university, delivered last evening, at the High school, the first of six lectures on the "Wage Question." These lec tures are of the university extension aeries for the present season, which is under the direction of the committee appointed last August by the High School Alumni association—F. L. Ham mond, chairman; Charles J. Ingles and Miss Sarah Patten. These lectures will be delivered each Monday at the moder ate cost of 75 cents for the entire course. After an effective definition and an alysis of the nature of political econ omy, the lecturer devoted himself to the question of the distribution of prod ucts. He mentioned the ideal plans of distribution— according to worn,to needs tojsacrifice. All of these are "void for uncertainty." He followed with a brief review of the economic experiments, actual and proposed, for the better dis tribution of wealth. After referring to monasticism, communism, socialism and profit-sharing, he laid special stress on the prospective vaiue and growth of co-operation. Of the latter the coopers' societies in Minneapolis are flattering examples. *" ■■'^fi This course will afford much practical THE

WORK FOR UNEMPLOYED Is What the Park Board Is Plan- nlnsr. The park board,at its regular meeting last night, approved the pay roll for October, amounting to 1*337.62, and passed a resolution renewing the pro ceedings for the condemnation of land for Phalen park. The funds originally appropriated for this purpose were re leased by the board at its last meeting by rescinding the Phalen park condem nation, as it expected to expend them to give work to the needy unemployed: but when the council reimburses the board next year, the amount borrowed from the Phalen park fund will be re stored to it and the proceedings will be renewed. The board adopted a resolution re questing the city council to take im mediate Droceedings for the opening of an extension of Ryde street, eighty feet wide, from Union street to the Como park boulevard, to the end that the board of park commissioners may utilize the labor of the needy unem ployed iv grading and improving the ex tension. . Mr. Adler, the caterer, asked permis sion to erect a warming house for the skaters, sleigh parties, etc. Inasmuch as the street railway company has of fered to do likewise, but has not thus far accomplished anything, the board decided to notify tho company that un less tbe latter took soma action immedi ately, the privilege would be accorded to Mr. Adler.

SIX JUDGES SIT TOGETHER, Judge Brill Presiding:, and Judge Flandrau Presents the Memorial. DECEMBER TERM IS BEGUN. Trial of Hawks, Accused of Bank Embezzlement, on Wednesday. At the opening or the December term of the Ramsey county district court yes terday, most of the lawyers of the city being present, it was deemed fitting to take action over tne demise of the late Horace R. Bigelow. All six judges of the court occupied seats on the bench, and Judge Brill, the senior member of the bench, presided. Judge Charles E. Flandrau was spokesman for the mem bers of the bar and read a memorial which was ordered spread upon the court records. Judge Brill, speaking for the court, made a feeling response to the remarks and memorial of the bar and directed a minute of the proceed ings to be made. The memorial is as follows: Memorial to Bi.elow. The Bar Association of Ramsey coun ty, being desirous of recording its senti ments on the lire and career of Mr. Horace Ransom Bigelow, one of its oldest and most honored members, de clares as lollows: The loss of an esteemed, associate by death Is always to be regretted, both by our organization and the community at large; but when, as in this instance, we are deprived of one who has long been recognized by unanimous consent as an eminent example of the wise counselor, the learned lawyer, the distinguished citizen, the friend of the poor and the just and good man in every relation of life, the loss becomes a calamity. As one of our oldest members, and also once the president of our society, we knew him thoroughly, and what we say regarding him springs from our hearts and is approved by our con sciences. He came to Ramsey county In the year 1853, when St. Paul was a mere hamlet. He brought with him a legal and moral equipment rarely imported into the far West in its infancy. In the short period of four years faom his arrival his superior qualifications for judicial prominence led his party, with unanimity, to select him as its candi date for the exalted position of chief justice of our state. As our industries expanded from the primitive to the perfected, when commerce supple mented agriculture, bis high character istics as a man ana a lawyer necessi tated his becoming prominently engaged in our advancing development, and he was chosen as the adviser and coun selor of our first railroad enterprises, which ha ably conducted to successful results. His general connection with and labors at the bar of this county and state for over forty-one years were a continuous and uninterrupted career of honorable endeavor in the interest of his clients; a splendid example in the cause of right and justice, aud a supreb vindication of the. elevated aims aud ends of the legal profession. His social and domestic relations were sublimated in their purity and goodness. His charity was only limited by his resourses. His religion, though not recorded in the creed of auy church established by. man, rested upon the authority of the God of nature and hu manity, found in the sublime harmonies that are exhibited in the works of the Creatior, and the hearts and con sciences of men. Such a life and character deserves the love and admiration of all mankind, and by this record we hone to preserve it to posterity as an example for imita tion, and to the present and future members of this association as an assur ance that no channel to greatness and goodness surpasses that presented by the legal profession, when fully appre ciated and properly lived up to. If a life of virtue and excellence on earth is an index to immortal existence, then shall our friend enjoy to the fullest the blessings of heaven. "The mau of honest worth The muse will not let die. But lifts him from the earth Among the blest on high." Charles E. Flandrau, Henry L. Williams, C. D. O'Brien, John B. Sanborn- George B. Young, Dan W. cawi. eh. Ambrose Tighe. Competitors of Dr. Price's Baking Powder are growing weary of trying to equal it. Their labors are vain. 

DECEMBER TERM BEGUN. Hawks' Bank Case Begins Wednesday. The December term of the Ramsey county district court opened yesterday. The calendar was called and cases set for trial, beginning today. Judge Brill will have charge of the criminal branch of the court, Judges Kelly and Egan will try civil jury cases, Judges Kerr and Willis will hear court causes, and Judge Otis will sit in chambers.

Barns, accused of securing money upon false certificates from the Second National bank and the Union bank, will come next in order. Hotel Barteau Foreclosure. Judge Egan has filed an order In the ease of Hiram BacKus against Mary and William L. Barteau and others, order ing a mortgage for $53,000 to be fore-, closed upon the Hotel Barteau property, it is also decided that Edward J. God frey has a priority lien for $1,414.81, that the National German-American bank. J. L. Merriam, A. J. Weldle, Charles Rheinholdsen, Tbe Minnehaha Street Building society aud William F. Thompson have no claims prior to the mortgage interest. Judge Otis has ordered Judgment In favor of David Swank against the St. Paul City Railway company for $517.60, for rent and damage to a barn at the top of the Selby avenue hill, which is used by the brakemen who work on the steep grade of the hill. It ls found that part of the money ls due for rent, and that the building was damaged to tbe extent of $50, by allowing windows to be broken, the shingles to be torn off the roof, and tha water pipes to freeze and burst. John Bartlett has sued the village of North St, Paul to recover 125,000 for in juries sustained l>y a fall on an icy side walk on New rear's day. Paul Hartman has begun an action against WHllam Banholzer to replevin a piano, valued at $200* LOCAL LEGISLATION. Chamber of Commerce Proposes to .shape It. '•Municipal Legislation*' was. the burning question before the chamber of commerce at its meeting yesterday morning. On motion of E. V. Smaliey the committee on legislation was In structed to report on Dec. 17 what legis lation is needed for the benefit of the city at the approaching session of the legislature. All interested citizens are requested to oe present at that date. W. 11. Dean moved a resolution "with a string to it"— that five delegates be ap pointed to represent the chamber at the municipal reform convention in Minne apolis Dec. 8 and 10, providing the chamber is invited. The necessity of reforming the Unit ed States consular service was brought before the chamber some weeks ago by the New York Evening Post. The mer cantile committee reported that the present system of appointments in the service at the dictation or politicians is detrimental to commercial interests. The committee recommends the appli cation of civil service principles. A resolution approving this report was adopted, and copies ordered sent to the Evening Post, the state department at Washington, and to our senators and reuresentatives. Tbe committee on transportation will investigate the alleged inadequate serv ice on the Selby cable line, to which at tention was called by Mr. Tig he. Proposed changes in national bank ing methods, as suggested by the Bal timore convention, will bo considered by the committee on banks and bank ing, in accordance with a motion of Mr. Smatley. Series of Bible Heading*. Rev. E. P. Marvin, of Lockport, N. V., is giving at the Gospel tabernacle. Market street, between Fourth and Fifth, a series of Bible readings on the "Dispensational History of Redemp tion."

He has just finished a similar series in Minneapolis and gives these each afternoon at 8 o'clock, con ducting evangelistic services each even ing at the same place. The public is iuvited. Commercial Club to Sleet. An important directors' meeting of the Commercial club will be held today at 1 o'clock, lt is probable that final action will then be taken in the matter of the Altamoute canal, which was con sidered by the club last Friday.

Warner, of the club, on tne subject of "Municipal Conditions in American Cities and Needed Reforms." Special Kiection Called.

TRUST SQUIRMS. CIiEVESaAND'H VIEWS CAIiI. OCT A PROTEST. President Havemeyer Claims the Sugar Octopus Is Not Pro tected. New York, Dec. President H. O. Havemeyer, of the American Sugar Re fining company, this afternoon gave out the following signed statement: "If one will fairly and dispassionately consider the president's recommenda tion about sugar it will become apparent that lteomes down to this: 'The sugar company has taken action, the result ot which is to deprive temporarily of work 25,000 persons employed in the various Industries dependent upon the refining of sugar, together with the members of their families. I recommend such ac tion as to deprive those persons of work permanently. If the Industry is lan guishing the proper course 'is to de stroy It.' "There are some things which can be established through a demonstration. A comparison of the duty put by the tariff I bill upon various articles will show while the maximum protection accorded to sugar is 5 per cent, other and more favored articles receive pro tection up to 40 and 50 per cent. Why this discrimination should be made against a large number ot persons who hold stock in the company and are em ployed in its refineries, it is Impossible to say. They protest against it. The answer to this protest in the president's message is Tf the present protection Is lnadequate.lt ought to be removed alto gether.' " 'Reasonable legislative aid' requires that the sugar industry shall be treated as were other Important Industries. if this is done the industry need not lan guish, and 'thousands of discharged workmen' will have remunerative em ployment. "The country has already pronounced Its Judgment on the mode in which the last congress dealt with the interests of the worklngmah. The president ap parently has not learned the lesson. It ought not to require much time for workmen to afcpreelate that the presi dent in a bid for pet tonal popularity is willing to strike a death blow at their lateresUH "H.Q. Havemeyell"
