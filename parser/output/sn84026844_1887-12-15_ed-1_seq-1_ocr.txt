It is part of the hiatory of tho Minneapolis revolt that the men who onginoarod it are the Anarchist element of tho order, which has declared war ou Mr. Powdorly and reeved to rule or rnin. It should give great satisfaction to tho friends of the Knights of Labor hereabouts that when the issuo was proasod here that element got but two votes. The atmoophere in getting clearer.

It is joyfully suggested that if the Ee publican Convention will consont to nominate another than Mr, Blaino, Mr. Conlrline may concent to come back into the fold ~acd even to bo Chairman of tho National Committee. The men who have preferred Mr. Blaine and do still prefer liim will support tho nominee of the Contention, which ia mora than Mr. Conkling did in 188-i.

Wabuiuqtok, D. 0., Doc. 14.?An amply foreshadowed in thooo dispatches, Judge Fauiknor took bis sent In tho Sonata as Mr. Camden's auccossor to-day at a quarter to 1, on tho adoption ol two resolutions, one declaring that Danlol B. Lucas was not entitled to tho teat, and tho other that Oharioa J. Faulkner was. There was no disaonting voico. There vaa a lull Senate cud tho procoedlng had no foatare beyond n brlul Interpolation by Benator l'lalt, ol Connecticut,as to whether Faulkner should bo Senator from March i, 18S7, or from the dato of election; bnt this point baa been bo long aottlod that it waa evident that tbo Connecticut Senator had but littlo to talk about. Chairman Hoar replied In an inaudible tone for a low minutee, when acting Vice President Ingalla put tho question, and the caae was settled in short order. Profound allonco reigned iva Judgo Faulkner, leaning on the arm of Senator Konna.paasod up tho middle alslo, through tho charmod circle that hedgsth about the Vice President, and was put through the iron-clad oath performanco by Mr. Ingalls. The Judge boro himself with Hue dignity and composure and must havo made a good impression upon hie critical associates, General Butler, of South Carolina, and Payne, of Ohio, were the first to congratulate him, and others followed in rapid succession, making quite a levee for the now Senator. Though still in the city, Mr. Lucas was not present to onjoy the profound and interesting spectacle. The gravamen of today's action is, briefly, that as the Constitution of tho United States says a State Legislature shall proceed to olect a Senator on the occurrence or exietenco of a vacancy, it ia not competent for a State Constitution or statute to restrict the Legislature as to time in the performance of that duty?good public policy dictating that the vacancy shall be filled at the earliest practicable time. As far as the election of a Senator ia concerned, therefore, the clause of the State Constitution narrowing* the functione of the Legislature, under the Governor's call, to objects mentioned in the proclamation, is a dead letter. To Restrict Immigration. After tho West Virginia cnae was diepoeod of, Mr. Morrill briefly explained the bill introduced by him yesterday. lie main obj ?ct, he said, was to have the character of foreign immigranta examined, first by the United States Consul at the port of departure, instead of by State OomraiEBlonera at the port of arrival. Tho foreign idea, he said, was that the United States invited free immigration, regardless of the character of the immigrants, bat the American idoa was that it never really offered an asylum to convicts, to irreconcilable enemies of law and order, or to tho occupants of the Old World's insane asylums and workhouses. The doors were left open only to persona of good moral character. By the csneua of 1880, the population of foreign birth and parentage was about 15,000,000; and the immigration sinco then 4,344,000. So that, without including the children born of ioreign parents sincg 1880, there waa now in this country a foreign population of 19,340,000, or nearly one-third of the entire population. This diacloeed thfc enormoua attractive force exerted by this country on the inhabitants of Europe. He had lately visited Castlo Garden, N. Y., where a veesol had just arrived from Antwerp with ttOO immigrants, and the sight he had witnessed suggested the doubt whether this country possebsed the transcendent power to transform all those immigrants into good and valuable American citizens. There was too strong a tendency in Europe to regard tho United States as a f.-,- ?>, n vlloot rworluntft nf A (.CBSpUUl IU1 bUO

Baltimore, Dec. 14.?Tho Federation o1 Labor Convention began buaino38 late this morning with comparatively few delegates present. William Martin, of Pittsburgh, offered a rule by which all delegates not answering to roll call will be fined. This rule waa adopted. Tho convention wont into executive session, and excluded reporters during part of the morning proceedings. When tho treasurer's report was to D0 presented the doora were closed and all outsiders had to leave during the secret session. Tho treasurer's report was acted upon, and delegates aay it waa adopted. The attitude of tho Federation toward me juugnu 01 i^aoor was snown this morning. The New York ahoemakora who left the K. of L. sent a delegate hero to-day. He waa refused admiaBion . on tho ground that hia constituents had not obeyed tho commanda of the Knighta . of Labor while members of that body. Thia action clearly shows that the Federa1 tion will not fight the K. of L, Ham Burt I did his boat for tho New York shoemak' era, and offered a resolution that they I should be taken into the Federation when r they shall have formed five local branches. Thia measure waa declared out of - order. W. J. DHlon, of the Flint Glass Workers' Union, says that arrangements 3 have been made by which the Federation will contribute $10,000 per week to the l Pittsburgh tableware mon now on a atrike. l President Weihe, of. the Amalgamated - Iron and Steel Workers, ia elated for an 3 office in the Federation.

A a RAND WELCOME ItKCEPTION Tendered to Two DletlngulaUed 1'fttrloU In Wtulilngton?An Hloqaent Speech by Beuntur Bhermnn-Addremod bJ Mr. logalla nud Otliora. Washington, D. 0? Dec. H.?Sir Thomas Henry Ejraonde, anil Hon. Arthur O'Connor, loadurn ol the Irish Homo Iiaie cunso, arrived in tho city this aitornoon. In the evening they -were tendered a reception by the Irish societies, at the Masonic Temple. The hall o{ tho templo was brilliantly iiinminiteil and decorated with American anil Iiisii Hags, whilo such inscriptions as "Bcotland, Walos and Ireland demand home rulo," "American Bympsthy is with Irelnnd," "Ooercion is an outrage on tho spirit of hnroan liber ty," "Colombia greota Gladatono and Farnoil," ornamented the ataga and walla. Nearly every neat in tho body of thohall waa occupied. It waa nearly 8:30 when tho diatinguiBhed gueatu arrived and woro escorted to aeataopontho platform, where a large number of Senatoru and Beproaentativea were proaont to do them honor. Amoug them were the following: Senatora Sherman, I'alracr and Hawley; Iispreaontativea Collino, Bland, Horbert,Outhwatto, Foran, Lawler, O'Neill, of Miaoouri, Woodbttin, Phelan, Orain, Kennedy, Parker, Nutting, J. D. Taylor, and Urorcn, of Ohio, mid Fred Douglaaa. Reproaentativo O'Neill, of Miacouri, propoaea the namo of Senator John Sherman for chairman, and ho waa olocted amid great cheering. 'Senator Sherman, in acknowledging tho compliment conferred upon him, waa created with load applaune and cheere. In'appearing hero to-night, ha said, he was bound to say that ho waa not an Iriahman, but tho trouble was that hia ancP6toro had come to tbra country ao many years ago that it waa abaolutely immaterial whether thoy wore Iriah, Engliah, Scotch or Welah. He know ono thing?he waa an American (applause) and aa an American, fooling himaelf froe to speak, not only of mattera concerning our national affaira, but alao aa to tbe affairs of friendly nations, ho took pleasure in Baying that he believed he apoke the general voice of the people of the United 8tatee in evory part of tho union whon he said to tho distinguished guests that the 8YMPATI1Y or AMEItlCA. wont forth fully and heartily in tho otrang desire that they might have home rule in Ireland to the full extent demanded by Parnell and Gladatono. (Applause.) Why should not Ireland have homo rule? Americana felt that they were born to nnxfuvn homoalnno *Un-? Ui.-> t huiu.u uuvugoiiuo uuu IUUJ U?VO UUU1U rulo not only in the nation but in every part of this graat organization of States. Oar nation armed with limited powers was but tho creature of the peoplo. Everywhere in onr country thero was, or ought to he, free and equal rights and equal privileges among all the citixena of the United 8tates. (Applause.) Ho wanted to see Iroland possess the aame rights aa thoso adopted by the peoplo of the United States, (Applause), and he believed that in this sentiment the general voice of tho people went with him. It waa not because they yore Irishmen, but becauao they were freemen, and deservod the privileges ol freemen, that they endorsed this sentiment. No country could be free unless it was governed by the peoplo of the community, and homo rule meant a "Government of the people, i by the people, and for the peoplo." [Appluae] Why should not Ireland have homo rale? Why was it that the British Government denied to the gem of the British Empire what was conferred on all the colonies of this great Empire ? Irishmen had led in advance of all the great battles which England had fought for two . centuries. Irish poets had not only made j the love eonga for the MEN* AND TTOMKN OF TUB WORLD, j but had written the national anthems of that great Empire. Ireland had furnishjed the Demonsthenes and Cycero of 'modern times, Iroland had produced : great mon in every branch of life. He did not claim any right to govern the British Empire, or to advise anybody in that groat and powerful Empire how to govern it; all ho could say was that he hoped that the pleading voice of Gladstone, the greatest statesman of the age (applause), would induce the British Parliament to grant homo rule, and that the manly courago and brave poraistance of Mr. Parnell (applause) might bo suatained in his eickness by the growing hopes of homo rule for Ireland. All the American people deBired for'this people of a kindred race was the right to govern themselves?-not to break down the British Erapiro, but to pasB laws affecting their local interests without the interference of tho British Parliament. In conclusion, Bonator Sherman said: "All we want, and all we pray for, is that Great Britain may yield to onr Irish brethren what they desiro and give them home rulo; and the British Governmont from that day forth will be stronger than ever amid the powers of tho world. (Loud applause.) "Now I am going," he added, (bowing to Senator Ingalls) to resign my office to tho gentleman who has come to take my piucu." Benator Ingalls, after tho applause with which he was greeted had Bnbsidod, said: bk nato el ingalls* bfescii. TVe havo assembled thia evening, he said, in the Bhadow ol the National Capitol for tho purpose oi voicing the sontimento of the assemblage that the canse of Ireland ia the cause of America great (applausa); that in a wider sonse it is not only the causo of Ireland, but ol humanity itself. Ho did not understand, ho said, that the Irish representatives of home rule deBire to interfere with tho unity of tho British Empire, bnt Britain should not forgot that there is nothing eo dangerous and eo unprofitable as an injustice; Great Britain should not forget that B8ven rpilliouB of people determined to be free; can never 30 enslaved; Great Britain should not forget that throe milliona of citizsnB in the original thirteen colonies revolted and achieved their independence under far less provocation than tho seven millions of Irloh people havo endurod for cen tunes. (Applause.) He did not desiro to trench upon the proprieties of tho occasion! nor to intrude upon tho comity of nations, but ' he could hot forget that a brutfil and degraded Brittoh ' soldiery within tho memory ol men who j might now be within the tearing of hio . volco, had sackod and burnod this capital. He could not.iorget that in1 every ; groat crinia in American history we have bad to contend with tho ill-will and , uialMOlenoo oi the governing classes oi | Great Britain; that jn that last great . Btrngglo lor the preservation oi oonatltu. tioual liberty upon this continont wo had tho ill-will oi tho governing claeBoe of Great Britain; that she consorted with the South, and equivocated with the North, and contributed everything Bhort ' oi actual hostility to secure the down> toll of TU1I AMERICAS BKIOX. In conclusion he said: "I shall never 9 cease to remember that during that awful j period thero was not a battlo field for 3 American liberty which waa not illustrated by Irish valor and consecrated Irish blood." llo then Introduced Sir Arthur O'Connor to tho andience, and ho wag rocoivod with cheers. Mr. O'Connor upoko eloquently of tho r wrongs ondnred by Ireland during the ' 700 yoars ol English mlo elnce that con<|ueot, and procoedeil to draw a vivid pie- 1 turg o( the oppression and hardship to which the Irish pooplo wore compelled to bow, and dotallod tho domands which tho Home Halo party modo npon tho Drltlsh Government.

While bolloTe that an ad valorem tariff is the nly (air and wise moaauro, Billl I will oto (or a upecitic tariff II by that moans I an get a bill passed reducing taxes." "Bo yon think a bill will bo passed by longreBS reducing the tariff?" "it Congress does its duty it will pass 01110 moasuro lowering tho duties and ecreaning rovenue." Do you thinte there will bo much differ* nee of opinion about tbo bill?" "Well, thero aro many interests that tnagino they will bo hurt by low duties nd helped by high ones, and, of course, bey will bo heard from, but I hope wo iay bo ablo to harmonize these conflictog opinions and pass a bill making Bubtantial reductions." "Will the bill, do you think, pass the onaio V" "I cannot tell about that. I am inclinod 3 think sorao bill will pass the Senate, t may not bo what wo want, and we may uarrel some over it in a leglolativo way nd then agree on something. Consulted as the two houses aro now, it iB bard 5 predict what phaao the bill will wear 'hen It gets through, if it Bhould succeed tall." "Do you think the tariff will be tho issue a tho compalgu of 18S8?" "There is no doubt of it, and I am glad lat we havo the battle pitchod on it.

"Do you think that any measure affectig the tariff that may be passed by this longresa will raako itself folt in the counry at large In time to havo any effect in hn Mmnnbn nflfiSS?" "If the tariff is lowered considerably, nd should bo passed by the iirat of Lprll.totake effect June 30, the price of ur exports will go up before tho bill ikes effect, and before November the imroved condition of agriculture, manufacires and commerce will be vory percepblo."

FRANK DEMOCRAT. , Democratic Congressman -who Says lJlulno Would cot tho Irish Vote. Washington, Doc. 14.?Since the publiition of tho President's message and the iterview upon its features with Mr. laine, there has been but one opinion mong (be members of Congress as to who ill bo the candidates of the Republican nd Democratic parties, respectively, in 3SS, There are a great many members rho do not think that it would be for the eat intorost of the party to nominate Mr. laine to cross swords with Mr. Clevemd, but there are less than a dozen who re willing to assert that Mr. Blaine will ot bo nominated. In fact his nomination i Chicago, on tho l?th of June next, is egarded as a foregone conclusion, proiding that he will accept, and there is ttle question on that ecoro. Congressaan Frank Lawler, of Chicago, an IrishLmerican Democrat, in speaking to-day pon this subject, said: "There is one tiing you may bo sure of, and that is, if Ir. Blaine is nominated by the Kepublians he will secure almost the entire ote of the Irish-Americana. Burchard 38t him a great many votes in !New York a 18S4, bat ho -will more than recover hia 3B8 in that Stato. Even then if the Remblican press had not made a national latter of it by attempting to apologize nd to counteract the effect of Mr. Jurcbard's foolish remarks it would have lot been no bad." "Do you think his trength has increased in Chicago among ho Irish?" "Yes, I think so. His ag;reB8ive policy toward England is undertood by the Irish-American leaders out here, and I havo no doubt but what they fill support him to a man. On the other tand, Mr. Cleveland, by his bold stand on he tariff, bus met with the approval of 9 per cent of the newspapers in the Jnited States; but," added Mr. Lawler, 'the newspapers of tho country do not lect candidates for the Presidency as eadily as they used to." "What is your >osition on tho tariff, Mr. Lawler?" "I lon't care to be interviewed on that subect just now. I prefer to wait until my onstituents have read and digested the 'resident's message. When they have lono so I have no doubt they will advise ne as to their sentiments, and then I shall 10 able to shape my course." "Do you hink that Mr. Ulaine can beat Mr. Gleveand?" "Now, look here, I am a Demorat, and I am not going to give my party way liko that." Air. Lawler's sentiments .re snared by a number of others who sit in his side of the House, and altogether here is a decided feeling of uneasiness .inong tho Democrats in Congress, in pite of the fact that they profess to beieve that the President's tariff viewB extress the sentiment of the country.

From 1850 to 1800, under low tariff, farms incroased 100 per cont in valnation; from 1800 to 1870, under high tariff, 40 per cent increase, and from 1870 to 1880, under high tariff, but 9 per cent.
