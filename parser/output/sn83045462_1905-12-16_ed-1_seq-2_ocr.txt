Sensational Features That Are Attract ing Considerable Attention in * New York and Elsewhere. NEW YORK, December Ifl.?The crucial legal point in the celebrated Dodg??-Morse divorce case, namely, the question whether Dodge was ever served with the summons to the divorca proceedings with his wife, who later became Mrs. Morse, was taken up today at the trial of Abraham H. Hummel, the lawyer, for conspiracy In this case. The first witness, William A. Sweet3er, was the lawyer who represented Mrs. Dodge in her original divorce proceedings. Sweetser said that he served the sqmmons in question on Dodge on March 1, 1897, at thx Everett House in this city. He then said, in reply to questions, that In 1903 he identified as Dodge a man whose real name was Ilerbltch. This was at reference pro ceedings In connection with the case. The prosecution In the Hummel trial has charged that Herbltch was used at the reference to Impersonate Dodge, who, they chr.rge. was being kept away from the city. SweetseT said that Mrs. Dodge was to pay all expenses of the divorce proceed ings, including her husband's counsel fee. Charles K. Herbltch, whom Sweetser testified he identified as Dodge In 1903, was then put on the witness stand. He said that he went to the reference proceedings in question at the request of Mr. Hummel. "I went to his office," said Herbrteh, "and he told me he wanted to use me for about fifteen minutes at a hearing, but did not want me to testify. He sent me to Judge Hall's office. at H2 Williams street. Hummel afterward entered the office with Steinhardt." "Did you receive anything for your serv ices?" "Yes, $25." "What did Hummel say to your "He told me that he wanted to see If a certain man would mistake me for some one else." 'You knew by* what you heard there that there was a dispute as to service of a summons?" "I did." Justice Rogers, who Is trying the case, asked at this point: "And when Sweetser greeted you as Mr. Dodse you did not make any response. I "I did not." , ' Charles W. Morse, the banker, organizer I of the American Ice Company and other corporations, was next called to the wit ness stand. It was In order to secure an annulment of the marriage of Clemence Dodge to Morse that the alleged con spiracy was entered Into by Hummel. Mr. Morse said that Hummel told him in 1902 that Mrs. Dodge's divorce from Dodge was corrupt and bad. Morse said he answered that If anything was wrong he wanted to set it right. The witness said that Sweetser showed him a news paper picture of Dodge which the lawyer said he had with him when he served the summons. Delancy Nlcoll, Hummel s at torney. then said: "And when you called his attention to the fact that by the dale on the paper the picture was not printed until months after the service of the summons what did he say?" _ j "That he would have to frame up some other excuse." was the reply. Mr. Morse testified that his wife said she preferred a new divorce from Dodge, and that she started an action for one. He said ! that Hummel was to act as Dodge's counsel in this new divorce, but that case was stop ped by intervention proceedings. Mr. Morse was asked about the attitude of his uncle, Capt. James T. Morse, the New England shipowner, regarding the marrlaga with Mrs. Dodge. "You have heard him say that Mrs. Dodge was an unfllt woman for you to marry?" he wis asked. "Yes." "You have heard him say also that he would take steps to break your marriage?" Yes." ? Mr. Morse said that he was in District Attorney Jerome's office, and that Mr. Jerome was present when Capt. Morse said he hid taken legal steps to break the mar riage. Judge Ernest Hall, who acted as referee in the Dodge divorce case in 1903, testified that Sweetser took Herbltch for Morse at one of the hearings, and that he afterward understood that Herbltch was there sim ply -.hat It might be seen whether Sweetser would recognize him as Dodge. Judge Hall said that Dodge himself was present at a later meeting, and that he did not at all resemble Herbltch in appearance". After this testimony the case was adjourned until next Monday. Alleged Payment of $77,250. If the district attorney proves his case against "Abe" Hummel. It will be shown that Hummel was paid $77,250 by Capt. James T. Morse, the uncle of Charles W. Morse, to break up the marriage of Mrs. Dodge to Charles W. Morse after she had obtained a divorce from her husband. Chas. F. Dodge. This much was outlined yester day in the opening of Assistant District Attorney Rand and In a series of questions put to Abraham H. Kaffenburgh and Na thaniel Cohen, who are employed by Mr. Hummel's firm. Mr. Rand said that he would prove that Captain Morse, who Is a Boston shipowner, went to Hummel, and, after asking Hum mel to look into the manlage of his nephew, gave Hummel $15,000 as a fee on Hummel's statement that he could show that the Dodge divorce had been obtained by fraud. It was after the Dodge divorce had been set aside and while Dodge was In Texas a fugitive from this state that Cap tain Morse paid, it is alleged, to Cohen, in sums ranging from $1,500 to $21,000. $02, 250. Mr. Rand Indicated that much In hi? questions to Mr. Cohen, and Captain Morse will undoubtedly testify that he pa:d the money to Cohen. For Public Works in Hawaii.

Local Suit Heard in United States Su preme Court. Tho case of Marian J. Looney, administra trix of the estate of James Looney. against the Metropolitan Railroad Company of this city, wag called for argument yesterday in the Supreme Court of the United States. This action was originally instituted to re cover damages for the death of James Looney, In 1901, who was then an employe of the Great Falls Railway Company, oper ating as a pitman in the plow pit at 36th street and Prospect avenue. His duties were to change the motive power of the through cars from Washington to Cabin John from the underground to the overhead system, and It was while operating the ma chinery in the pit on the date mentioned that Looney lost his life while handling the electrical apparatus. Tho questions of law raised In the case were interesting, as they Involved the well known doctrine of fellow-servant. Coun sel for plaintiff contended that the doctrine did not apply, as the accident resulted from the negligence of the crew of the Metropolitan car which passed over the pit while Looney was an employe of the Great Falls Company. This contention was op posed by the defendant, contending that the Metropolitan car became a Great Falls car upon its arrival at the pit by reason of being on the Great Falls roadbed, and the apportionment of the receipts in favor of the Great Falls road, and payment of the employes of the said car out of the funds of the Great Falls Railway Company. Mr. Maurice D. Rosenberg of the local 1 bar opened the argument in behalf of the plaintiff in error, Mr. J. J. Darlington ap peared In behalf of the defendant in error and Mr. Alexander Wolf closed for plaintiff In error. The legal questions Involved are of an In teresting nature, and the decision of the Supreme Court is eagerly looked for. PRESIDENT'S VIEWS. Warmly Approves of Proposed School of Correction. The delegates to the conference here on the matter of interstate schools for depend ent and delinquent children . called at the White House to see President Roosevelt yes terday. " He expressed himself as much In terested in their work, and during the course of their visit said: "About all I can say to you Is to ex press my very hearty sympathy with and belief in your purpose. The time of iny life, when I was brought into closest touch with conditions similar to those which you are trying to remedy, was while I was po lice commissioner In New York city. At that time my closest friend and associate In all my work was Mr. Jacob Rlls, wKh whose books and writings you are all more or less familiar. I was even more im pressed than I have been all along, ever since I have been grown up, with the tact that if you are going to do anything per manent for the average man you have got to begin before he Is a man. The older man is almost impossible to reform. "Of course, there are exceptional lndl \ (duals?men who have been completely changed, not only after they have reached years of manhood, but after very advanced periods of life. But, speaking generally, the chance of success lies In working wltn the boy and not with the man. "That applies peculiarly to those boys who tend to drift off into courses which mean that unless they are checked they will be formidable additions to the criminal population when they grow older.
