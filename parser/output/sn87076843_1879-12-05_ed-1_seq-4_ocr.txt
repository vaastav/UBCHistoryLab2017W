Hcpnrta from ho Hc'rciary of the Interior, from the Postmaster-Ov-noral. from the J'oat maater in the eitv of New York, where ench ex aminations have lecn Home time on trial, and also from the Collector of the Port, the Naval Officer, and the Surveyor in that city, and from the Post masters and Collector in several of the other large eitlea. how that the comctitive system, where applied, nan. in various waya, contribu ted to improve the public acrvico. The reports show that the results have been aalntarv in marked d.-irreo, ntl that the general application of aimilar rules cannot fall to be ol decided benefit to the acrvice. ... The report of the Oovcrnment officers in the city of New York especially, bear decided teati monytothentility of open competitive rxamina tiona in their rciective nllicea, showing that " thcac cxaminations.'nnd thcexcellciitciualihca tiona of thoao admitted to the service through them, have had a marked incidental effect upon the ieraona previmialy in the aervico, and par ticularly fipnn those aspiring to promotion. There has been, on the part of theae latter, an 111 nreaacd in tercet in the work, and a dcaire to ex tend acquaintance with it beyond the particular dw.lt orenpied, and thua the moral nf the entire force haa been raised. The everninay tiona have been attended by many citizens who have bad an opportunity to thoroniihly inveeti irnte the aeope and character of the tests and the mcthnda of determining the results, and those visitors have, without exception, approved the mcthoda emploveil, and aeveral of tbcm have publicly attcatel their favorable opinion. Upon auchoonaidcrationa, 1 deem it ruy duty to renew the recommendation contained in my annual message, of December, 1877. ropiesting Congress to make the necessary appropriation for the resumption of the work of the Civil Ser vice Commission. Kconomy will bo pnimoted by snlhorisitig a moderate compensation to persons in the publio acrvico who may perform extra la bor nimn or under tho Commianion, aa the Kxec ntivo may direct. . , . ... I am convinced that if a Jnat and Bileojnatc teat of merit ia enforced for admission to the public aervicc and in making promotion, such etiiisea aa rcmovala without good cauae and imrtiaan and official interference with tho proper exer cise of the appointing power, will in largo mcas ure rliaapiiear. . . ,. . There are other adminiatrativeabuaoa to which the attention of Congraaa ahould be aaked in thia connection. Mere partiaan appointmenta.and the constant peril of removal without caiiac. very naturally lead to an abaorlnng and mischievous political activity, on the part of thoHO thua ap pointed, which not only interfere with the due .liecliargo of official duty, but la incompatible; with the freedom of elections. Not without war rant, in the vicwa of several of my pteileccaaora in tho Presidential office, and directly within tho law of ltfll.alrcady cited, I endcavon-d. by regula tion, mado on tho Kit day of June, 1877. to put some reasonable limits to such anuacs. It may not bo easy, and it may never perhaps be necea aary, to define with precision the proiajr limit of political action on tho part of Federal officers. Put while their right to hold and freely express thoir opinions can not be ciuostioned, it is very plain that thoy should neither lie allowed to do vote to other subject the time needed for the proper discharge of their official duties, nor to nse the authority of their office to enforce their own opinions, or to eoerco the Kilitical action of those who hold ditTerentopinions. Iteasons of justice and public policy, finite analogous to those which forbid the use ot offi cial power for the oppression of tho private citi zen, impose upon tho t.ovcrnmcnt the duty of protecting its officers and agenta from arbitrary exactions. Iri whatever aspect considered, tho practice of making levies, for 'party punoes. iiiwn tho salaries of officers is highly doinoraliit ing to the public service and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money 111 aid of his opinion or his party, ho should also be aa free aa any other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If'salariea are but a fair comjionsation for the time and labor of the officer, it is a gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear the taxj the excess iB an indirect robbery of the pub- '"1 recommend, therefore, anob. a revision and extension of present Btatutes aa shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public em nl.tvmant the orotection with which a great and enlightened Nation should guard those who are taithtul in lta service. OUR 

RELATIONS WITH FOREION COUNTRIES With (I rout. ISriljuii there are still unsettled questions, growing ont of the local lawa of the msritime nrovincca and the action of provincial authorities, deemed to be in derogation of right seen red by treaty to American fishermen. The United State Minister in London has been in structed to present a demand for ifrlOo.WKi.OJ, in view of the damages received Dy American citi zens at Fortune Jiay on the (ith of January, lt78. The subject has been taken into consideration by the Uritish Government, and an early reply in stil.iniiutted. Upon iho completion of the necessary pre- lllllllinry tJJtttl.l.llUHW.lt,, nui.jt.i-, tri. wiai - tii'ioation in the provincial naheriea.a rtgiilatini by treaty, will at once be brought to the atten tion of the British Government with a view to an early and permanent acttlemcnt ot the whole iiuestion, which was only temporarily adjusted by the Treaty of Washington. , Kifort have been made to obtain the rrnioval of restrictions found injurious to theexporUtion of cattle to the linitcu Kingdom. Home eorrennondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and prop erty upon the lake, which has resulted in im portant modifications ol the previous rivulatlons ol the dominion uovrrniucni on toe sunject, the intenwt of humanitv and commerce. In accordance with the joint resolution of the last session of Congress, Commissioners were appointed to represent the United Mates at the two International Exhibitions in Australia, one of which is now in progress nt H.vdne.v, and the other to be held next year ut Alelliouriie. A de sire has been expressed by our merchants and manufacturers interested in the inisirtant and growing trade with Australia, that an increased provision should be made by Congress for the representation of our industries at the Mel bourne Exhibition of next year, anil thesiihject ia respectfully submitted to your favorable con sideration. The assent of the Government has been given to the landing, on the coast of Massachu setts, of a new and INDEPENDENT THANH ATLANTIC CAHI.E between France, by way of the French island of Ht. Pierre, and this country, subject to any future legislation of Congress on the subject. The conditions imposed, Defore allowing this connection with our sborea to be established, are such as to secure it competition with any exist ing or future lines of marine cable, and preclude amalgamation therewith, to provide for entire duality of right to our Government and peopl with those of France in the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege aa accorded by Franoe to the disadvantage of any future cable communication between Franceana the United tttatea which mav be tirotnctAH accomplished by our citizens. An important re- nucuon or im present race or caoie communi cation with Europe, felt to be too burdensome to the interests of our commerce, must necessa rily flow from the establishment of this compet ing line. The attention of Congress was drawn to the propriety of some general regulation by Congress of the whole subject of transmarine cable by my predecessor in hia message of December 7, 1875, and 1 respectfully submit to your consideration the importance of Congressional action in this matter. The ijneations of grave importance with Spain crowing out of the incident of THE t't'BAN INHt'HUEtTION, have been, for the most iart, happily and honor ably aettled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the Commission now sitting in Washington for the decision of private cases, in thia connec tion, will soon bo able to bring its labors to a conclusion. The long-standing question of East Florida claims baa lately been renewed as a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require Con gressional action for its filial disposition. A treaty with the Netherlands with resucct to Consular right and privileges, similar to thoio with other powers, has been aigned and rati- ull1d. H"r ,rVm,t"m" """ exchanged on i theaistof July aat. Negotiation for extra dition treaties with the Netherlands and with Denmark are now in progress. Home iioestions with Switzerland, in regard to pauper and convict emigrant, have ariacn. but it is not doubted that they will be arranged upon a Juat and satisfactory Wis. A question Vas also occurred with respect to an asserted claim by hwiaa municipal authorities to exercise tute lage over persons and property of Bwiss citizens naturalised in this country. It is possible this may require adjustment by treaty. With the German Empiro freiiuent questions arise in connection with the subject of natur alisation and expatriation! but the Imiatrial Government haa constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty stipulations in regard to theiu. J Jn epiueuuenee of the omission of Congresa to provide for a diplomatio representative at Athena, the legation to Greece haa been with drawn. 1 here is now no channel of diplomatio communication between the two countries and the expediency of providing for one, in some form, is submitted to Congress lUjlationa with Austria, Kussia, Italy, Portu KJl Turu "d B'.u" uoutinue amicable, Inoe n ,ut'lcU;llt of Ieojl impurW A change of the personal head of the Govern ment of Egypt liaa Ukeu place.

It Is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the Judicious and energetic action of the military commanders of the two Nations on eseh aide of the Hio Grande, nnder the inatrne tiona of their reaiiective Governments, raids and depredationa have greatly decreased, and, in the localities where formerly miwt destructive, have now almost wholly eeaaed. In view of this re sult, 1 entertain a confident expectation that the prevalence of ipiiet on the border will soon le come so assured as to Justify a modification of the present orders to our military commanders as to creasing the border, without encouraging such diatiirhaucca aa would endanger the peace of the two countries. The third installment of the sward airainat Mexico nnder the Claima Commission of July 4, lHirt, was duly paid, and haa been put in oourso of distribution in pnrsuance of the act of Con grcaa providing for the same. Thia aatiafactory situation between the two countries leads me to auticiimte an expansion of our trade with Mexi co and an increased contribution of capital and industry by our people to the development of the great resources of that country. I earnestly commend to the wiadom of t!ongres the provis ion of suitable legislation hsiking to this result. Diplomatic intereourae withOjonihia ia again fully reatored bv the arrival of a Miniater from that country to the United Htatea. Thia is es pecially fortunate in view of the fact that tho qmation of an intena'cBnie canal has recently assumed a new and important aspect, and is now nnder diacuasion with the Ontral American countries through whiwo territory the canal, by the Nicnragua route, would have to (was. It ia trusted that enlightened atatesmanahip on their part will see that the early prosecution of such a work will Isrgely inure to tho benefit not only of their own citizens and those of the United State, but tho commerce of the civ ilised world. It is not doubti-d that should the work be undertaken nnder the protective aus pice of the United States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the right of way .and its security, by theCentral American governments, tho cap ital for it completion would be readily furnished from this country and Europe, which might, falling such guarantees, provo inaccessible. Diplomatic relations with Chili have also been atrengtnened by the reception of ajMinister from that country. The war between Tern. Bolivia and Chili atill continues. The United States have not deemed it projer to interpose in the matter, further than to convey to all the Governments concerned the assurance that the friendly offices of tli Govern ment of the United States for tho restoration of peace upon an honorahle basis will be extended, in esse the beligcrenta shall exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cordial relations eontinne with Brazil and the Argentine Hepublic, and trade with these coun tries ia improving. A provision for regular and moro f reiiiieut mail communication, in our own ships, between the isirt of this country and the Nations of South America seems to me to deserve the attention of Congress, ss an essential pro cursor of an enlargement of our commerce with thm, and an extension of our carrying trade. A recent revolution in Venezuela has been fol lowed by tho establishment of provisional Government. This Government hBS not yet been formally recognized, and it i s deemed do sirablo to await the procd action of the peo ple, which is exjiected to give it the sanction of constitutional forms. A naval vessel has been sent to the Hamoan Islands to make surveys and take possession of the privilegea ceded to the United States by Samoa, in the harbor of Pago Pago. A coal ing atation is to ho established there, which wul be convenient and useful to United States vessels. The subject of opening diplomatic relations with lloumania and Scrvia. now become inde pendent sovereignties, is at present under con iderntion, and is the subject of diplomatic correspondence. There ia a (HlATlFVINf! INCREASE Or TRADE with nenrly all European and American eoun trica and it ia believed that with judicious ac tion in regard to its development it can and will be still more enhanced, and tLat American prod ucts and manufacturers will find new and ex panding markets. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers uimn this subject, under the system now adopted, have resulted in obtaining much valuable information, which has been and will continue to be laid before Coiigrca and tho public from time to time. The third article of the treaty with Hnsaia, of March 80. 1807, by which Aluska was ceiled to the United States, provides that tho inhabitant of tho ceded territory, with the excoption of the un civilized native trine, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizena of the United States, and shall be maintained ami pro tected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, proierty and religion. The uncivilized tribea are subject to such laws and regulations as the u i-. i Ktotc mnw. fr4"? .ti.H'e d.-.k lu regard to the aboriginal tribes of that country. Both the obligation of this treaty and the necenfliiie or me ieopie, require mat some or ganized form of Government over the Territory of Alnaka lieadontcd. Thereappcar to be no law for the arrest of persons chsrged with common-law offences, such as assault, robbery and murder, and no magis trate authorized to isniie or execute process in auch cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen from offence of thia character, not only among the original inhabitants, but among citi zens of the United States and other countries who have engaged in mining, fishing and other business nnerationa within the Territory. A bill authorizing the appointment of Justice ot the pence and constables, and the arrest and de tention of persons charged with criminal of fences, and providing lor an appeal to United Statca Courts for the District of Oregon, in suita ble easm, will, at a proper time, be submitted to Congress. The attention of Congress is called to the an- nnai REPORT OF THE BECRETARV Or THE TREASURY on the condition ol'thenilhlic finances.

The large amount exjiended for arrenrs of pen sions during the Inst and the present fiscal year amounting to 21.747,WJ.fi(), has prevented the application ot tne tun amount required by law to the sinking fund for the current year; but these arrears having been substantially paid, it is believed that the sinking fund can hereafter be maintained without any change of existing law. The Secretary of War report that THE WAR estimstes for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are 40m4.i, tne same being for a less sum of money than any annual estimate rendered Umgreaa from that department during a period of at least twelve years. He concurs with the General of the Army in recommending such legislation aa will authorize the enlistment of the full number of 

2S.KKJ men for the line of tht Army, exclusive of the 3.403 men required for detached duty, and, therefore, not available for service in the field, lie also recommends that Congress be asked to provide bv law for the disposition of a large number of abandoned military posts and reser vations, which, though very valuable in them selves, have been rendered uaelesa for military purpose by the advance of civilization and set tlement. He unites with the Quartermaster-General in recommending that an appropriation be mado for the construction of a cheap and perfectly tire-proof building for tho aafe atorage of a vast amount of money accounts, vouchers, claima and other valuable reoords now in the Quartermaster-General's office, and exposed to gn at risk of total destruction by fire. .He also recommends, in conformity with the views of the Judge-AdviH-ato General, aomo declaratory legislation in reference to the mili tary statute of limitations as applied to the crime of desertion In these several recommendations I concur. Iho Secretary of War further report that tho WL,,rr, tl!e "npro'oment of the South Pass of the Mississippi River, under contract with Mr. James 11. EadB, made in pursuance of an act of Congress, has been prosecuted during the past year with a greater measure of success in tho at tainment of result than during any previous year, ihe channel through the South Pass, which, at the beginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only seven and one-half feet of water, had. on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of twcnty-ai feet, having a width of not less than two hundred feet and a central depth of thirty feet. Payment have been made in ac cordance with the statute, aa the work prog ressed, amouuting in the aggregate to 4,250,000: and further payment will become due. as pro vided by the statute, in the event of success in maintaining the channel now secured. 1 he reports of the General of the Army and of bis subordinates ureaent a full .,, .l.-i-.l.-l .... count of the military operation for the suppression "OaT'I'TIES AMONO THE INDIANS t .u of the Uteand Apache tribes, and praise is Justly w vv ijiuuois auu tnsipa engagea Ior promptness, skill and courage displayed.

The report of the Secretary show the gratifying fact that among all the disbursing officer of tho pay corps of the Navy there is not one who i a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with him in recommending the removal of the Observatory to a more healthful location. That institution reflects credit uian the Nation, and has obtained the approbation of scientific men in all part of the world. It removal from it present location would not only be conducive to the neaitn oi it officer and profcsnor. but would greatly in it naeflllnesa. THE APPROPRIATION FOR JUDICIAL EXPENSES. which h heretofore ment of Justice, in grosa, was sub-divided at the isal sMiif,n i,r Colon-can. and no anoroitriation whatever was maxle for the istymcnt of the fece of Marahal and their Deputiea, either in the erviee of proeesa or for the discharge of other dutic; and, since Juno 30, these officers hsve continued tho performance of their dutiea, without compensation from the Govern ment, taking upon themselves the necessary in cidental outlays, aa well aa rendering their own nervier. In only few unavoidable instances haa the proer execution of the process of the United State failed by reason of the absence of the requisite appropriation. This course of official conduct on tho imrt of thoe officer, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the Attorney General, who informed them, how ever, that they would necessarily have to rely for their oomiienaation uisin the prospect of future legiaiatlon ny tjongreaa. i toereioro i-ssf -isiiy recommend that immediate appropriation be made by Congress for this mnso. ine act maaing toe pnucipni npproin mbitm on the Di'iiartment of Justice at previous sessions u uiiiiormiy contained tne lonowing ciaune; And for defraying the exiennea which may bo Incurred in the enforcement of the act approved Kebrnsrv VH.

REPORT OF THE POSTMASTER GENERAL bcara testimony to tho general revival of husi neBB throughout the country. The receipts of the Post-office Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were oO,041,98,2.8fi, being ifr7li4,4ti6.Ul more than the revenues of the pre ceding year. The amount realized from the sale of ismtage ntamiM, stamped envelopes and ixxtnl cards waa tl7(i4,!fW).'Jl more than in the preceding venr. and '2.HH7.55'..ffl more than in 1S77. The expenditure of tho Department were 33,449,- BJV. 'ID, or WHICH tne suiu oi t.i'o.ioi.im wus pniu on liabilities incurred in preceding years. The exnendit.ures during the vcar were $801 209.77 less than in the preceding year. This re duction is to be attributed mainly to the iqtera tion of the law paaaed June 17, 1878, changing the compensation of postmasters from a commis sion on the value of stamp sold, to a commis sion on stnniM cancelled. The amonnt drawn from the Treasury on ap propriations in addition to the revenues of the department was 3.021.454.U6, being '2,i?76,197.86 less than in the preceding year.

The relations of the Deoartment with railroad cninitanica have been harmonized, notwithstand ing the general reduction by Congress of their compensation, by the appropriation for special facilities, and the railway lmst-oftice lines have been greatly extended, especially in the South ern States. The interest of the railwnv-niail service and of the public would be greatly pro moted, and the exitcnditures could be more readily controlled by tho classification of the employes of the railway-mail service sb recom mcnilcd by the Pontmaster General, the appro priation for salaries, with reaiect to which the maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be mado in cross. The Postmaster General recommends an amendment ot the law regulating the in crease of compensation for increased service and increased speed on star routes, so as to enahlo bim to advertise for proposal for Mich increased service and speed. Ho also suggests tho advantages to accrue to the com merce of thecountrv from the enactment of f:encral law authorizing contracts with American illilt steamer, carrying the American Mag, for trniiHiKirting the mail between porta of the tinted States anil isirts ot the West Indies and South America, unda fixed maximum price per mile, the amount to bo eMndcd being regu lated by annual apprnpriation, in like manner with the amount paid for the domestic star serv ice. The arrangement made by the l'otmaster General and the Secretary ot the Treasury for the collection of duty uim bmiks received in the mail from foreign countries, has proved so satis factory in its practical osration that the recom mendation is now made that Congress shall ex tend the provisions of the act of March 3, 1879, under which this arrangement waa made, so as to apply to all other dutiable articles received in the mails from foreign countries. The report of tho Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, set ting forth the present state of our relations with the Indian tribea of our territory, the measures taken to advance their civilization and nronjx'ri ty, and the progress already achieved by them, will be found of more than ordinary interest. The general conduct of the Indian isipulation haa been ao satisfactory that the occurrence of two disturbances, which resulted jn bloodshed and destruction of property, is all the more to be lamented.

WHITE RIVER t)TE RESERVA TION in Western Colorado has become so familiar by elaborate reisirta in the public press that its re markable incident nci-d not be stated here in detail. It is exiiected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead tosuch arrangements will prevent further hostile contact between the In dians and the border settlements in Western Colorado. The other disturbance occurred at the Mea calero Agenoy, in New Mexico, where Victono, the head of a small band of marauder, after committing many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military force, made his way acrosa the Mexican border and is now on foreign soil, , While those occurrences, in which a comiiara tively amull number of Indians were engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority of our Indian population have fully justi fied the expectations of those who believe that by humane and peaceful iutlu etices the Indian can hu led lo abandon the habits of savage life and to develop a capacity for useful and civilized occupations. Wind they have already accomplished in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable success which has alttnded the experiment of employing as freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest and most intractable, and the general and urgent desire expressed by them for Ihe education of their children, may hu taken aa eiillidont proof that they will bo found capable uf accomplishing. much more they euiitiniiu to be wisely and fairly guided. The "Indian policy'' sketched in the report of the Secretary of the Interior, the object of which is to make liberal provision for the education of Indian youth, to settle tin In dians iihju farm-lots In severalty, to give Ihein title In fee to their faru.s. inalienable for a certain number of years, and when their wants are thus provided for, to dispose by sale of the lands ou their reservations uot occupied ami used by them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds for the heuerlt of the Indians, which will gradually re lieve the Government of Ihe expenses now provid ed for by annual sppropriatious, must counneud itself ss just aud beuencial to the Indians, and as also calculated to leiuove those obstructions which the existence of lare reservations preseuts to the settlement and development of the country. I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law cuablliig the Government to give Indians title in fee, lualieiiable for twenty-live years, to the farm lands assigned to them by allotment. also repeat the recomiueudatlun made lu uiy first annual message, that a law be passed admitting Indians who cau give satisfactory proof of having by their own labor, supported their families fora uumber of years, and who are w illing lo detach themselves from their tribal relatlous. lo the benefit uf the homestead act, aud to grant theiupateuts containing the same provision of Inalienability for a certain period. The experiment of sending a number of Indian children, of both sexes, to the Hampton Normal aud Agricultural institute, lu Virginia, to receive au elementary Bngllsb educatiou and practical In struction In farming and other useful Industries, has led to results so prumlslug that It was thought expedient to turu over the i avail y barracks at Carlisle, In Pennsylvania, to the Interior Depart nieut for the establishment of an Iudiau school ou a larger scale. Ibis school has now oue hundred aud Afty-elght pupils, selected from various tribes, aud Is in full operation. Arrangements are also made for the educatiou of a number of ludian boys snd girls belouglug to tribes ou the Pscille slope, lu a siuiilsr manner, at Forest Grove, lu Oregon. These iuslitiitioui will commend them selves to the liberality of Congress, aud lo the philanthropic niuuiflceuce of the American people. ljist spring. Informal lou was received of Ibe or gauizstiou of su exte-ustve n ovemeut lu the Western States, the object of which was Ihe occu uatlou by unauthorized persous of certain lands lu the Indian Territory ceded by the Cherokee lo the Goverumeut for the purpose of settlement by other ludlau tribes. Ou the Willi of April, I issued a proclamation warning all persous agalust participation lu such au attempt, aud, by the co-operation of a military force, the invasion was promptly checked. It Is niy purpose to protect the rights uf the ludian lu babliautsof thai Territory to the full exteut uf the JtxecutJve power. But it would be un wise to lguore the fact that a Territory su large and so fertile, with a population to sparae sud with so great a wealth of uiui-rf r... sources, will be fouud more exposed to Ihe repeti- awvu aiicuque usppeucu iuis year, wueu tuesurrouud Utf hlates ars more dsiiMHlw MWtilu aud the westward inuvemeul of our populailou uiuiv eagerly ior iresu lauds lo occupy. Under such circumstance the dittleuliy uf uiaiu taiuii (he luUisu Territory iu its prvstul iut0 a i will greatly Increase, and tha Indian tribe Inhab iting It would do well to prepare for nc.h a con tingency. 1 then-fore fully approve of the advice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recent occasion, to divide among Ihsmaslvea In aeveralty aa large a quantity of their lands a they ran cultivate, to acquire Individual title la fee, In- atend of their present inoai ownersiopui ronnnon, and to consider In what manner Ihe balance of their Isnrts may be disposed of by the Government for their benefit. By adopting such policy they would more certainly cctire for thf maelve the value of their possessions, and at the aamo time promote their progrena In civilization and pros perity, thn by endeavoring to rs-rpetuate the present state of thing In the Territory. 1 lie question wntjincr huiihiikd ".. the Indian aervlee should be nwrte waa lu the Knrtv llflh Tenures referred to a joint Committee of both House for Inquiry and roiwirt. In my last annual message I expressed the hoM) that the derision of that question. the In prospect, "would arrest runner agitation mo snuieci, auch agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service a well as the Indians themselves." Since then, the committee having reported, the question has heifl decided In the negstive by a vote In the Ibpse of Kepresonta- Kor the reason here stated Rd In view of the fact that further uncertnlnt on this point will be ralnilated to obstruct olhe much-needed legisla tion, to weaken the dlsoplliie of Ihe service, and to unsettle suliitary men-urea now in progress ior the government snd lmrovement of the Indians, 1 respectfully recomiiKiid that the decision arrived nt by Congress at Itr last session be permitted to stand. The efforts ninrte by rlls ntsiurMKMT or THE fMTKMon lo arrest Ihe diprcihitlone on limber bind of the l ulled State have been continued, and have met with consldirnblo aucceea. A lnrgu number of case of trciiaaa have been prosecuted In the tourts of theC'nltcd Stnleaj others have been aet tled, the trcsnsser nltcring to mnae payment to the (lovernm-nt for the value of the timber taken by them. Tie proceeda ot these proseciillona and settlement ttriicd Into the Trenail ry.fnr exceed In amount the sun appropriated by Congresa for this purpose. A nore Important result, however, con sist in ine tan inntino destruction oi our puiiiic forests bv denudation, although such ciisea still occur, haa heel greatly reduced In extent, and It is probable that If the present policy is vigorously pursued Biid sufficient provision to that end I mado y Congnss, such trespasses, at least tluxe on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, ixccpt In tho Terri tories where timber for the diily requirement of Ihe population cannot, under tie present state of the law, lie otherwise ohluiicn. I therefore earnestly Invite the attention o congress to tno recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a Inw be enacted einhlliig tho Gov ern nieut to sell timber from the uibllcland with out conveying the fee, where such lands ore nrincloallv valuable for the timber thereon, such sales lo be so regulated ns to cosortn to domestic wnnt and business reiititrumeils, while at tho snine time guarding against a sweeping destruc tion of the forests. The ennctmc nt f such a law appears to become a mure yrossjif; necessity everv ilav. My recommendations In former messages are re newed In favor of enlarging the fictlitic of THE 

DEPARTMENT OF AOHI.X'LTUItE. Agriculture is tho leading Interst and the per manent industry of our people. I Is to the abun dance of agricultural prodtictioi, a compared with our hoine consumption, nnd he luively In creased and highly profitable mnrkit abroad which we have enjoyed In recent year, that we are mainly Indebted for our present prosperity as a people. We must look for Its ciatiniied main tenance to the same subtaiillal reource. There is no branch of Industry in which hbor, directed by scientific knowledge, yields suchincreascd pro duction In comparison with uvkllled lunor. and no branch of the public seirice to which Ibe encouragement ot liberal ipprnnrintions can be more appropriately exteudci. Inn omis sion to render such aid is not a wiseeconomy; but on the contrary, undoubtedly reti;s in losses of Immense sum nnniinlly thnt mljit be saved through well-directed efforts by the Gvernmeiit to promote this vitttl interest. The results already accomplished 'ith the very limited means heretofore placed at ae command of the Department of Agriculture is n earnest of what may he expected with incrensd appropria tions for the aeveral purpose iudicxed lu the re port of the Commissioner, with a viw to placing the Department upon a footing whld will enable It to prosecute more effectively te.objects for which it is established. Appropriations are needed for a rrire complete laboratory, for the establishment of a veterinary division, and a division of forestry, .nd for au in crease of force. The requirements for these and nper purposes. Indicated in the report of IheConisvsslouer under the head of the Immediate necesities of the Department, will not Involve any expenditure of money that the country caunotvith propriety now undertake in the interests of e;ricultiiru. It Is gratifying to learn from THE Rt'KKAP or EntTOA'ION the extent to which educational prilleges through out the United Stntcs have been atauced during the year. No more fundnmeiita responsibility rests upon Congress thau-thut of deislng appropri ate measures of financial aid to edention, supple mental to local action In the States nd 'I errltorles, and iu the District of Columbia, he wise fore thought of the founders of our Gvernment has not only fnrnisbed tho basis for thisnpport of the comiuon-Bchool system of the ne'er States, but laid the foundations for the mnlutaance of their universities and colleges of arlculture and mechanic arts. Measures in accornnce w.th this traditional policy for the furtherbenetlt of all these interests, and the extensio of the same advantages to every portion of he country, It is hoped will receive your favoible considera tion.

While the nimber of pupils ia rapidly increasing, no adoqnatf provision exist for a corresponding increase of schtaii accommo dation, and the Commisaionea are without the means to meet thia urgent neel. A number of the buildings now used for sclool purptme are rented, and are, in importan. particulars, un suited for the purpose.
