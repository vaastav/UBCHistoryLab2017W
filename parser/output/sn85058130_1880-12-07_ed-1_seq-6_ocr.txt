by the Fortyfifth congress for the commence ment of a breakwater and Harbor of refuge to De located at eomo point I between the straits of Fuca and San Francisco at which the necessi ties of commerce local and general will be the best accommodated Tbe amount appropriated is though to be quito inadequate for the purpoee intended The cost of the work when finished will be very great owing to tho want of natural advantages for a site at any point on the coast be S tween the designated limits and it has not neen thought advisable to un dertake the work without a larger ap propriation 1 commend tbe matter to the attention of congress DEPAUTKEST BUILDING S Tho compction of the new building for the var department is urgently needed and estimates for continuing its construction are especially recommended The col lections of books specimens and re cords constituting the army medical museum and library are of national importance The library now con tains about 51500 volumes and 57 000 pamphlets relating to medicine surgery and allied topica Toe con tents of tbe army medical mueum consist of 22000 specimens Their destruction would be an irreparable loss not only to the United States but to the world There are fled in the record a dupsnsary division over 16000 bound volunua of hospital records together with a great quantity of papers embracing original record 01 the hospitals of our armies during the civil war Asido from their historical value these records are daily searched for evidence needed in the settlement ot large num bers of pension and other claims for the protection of government ment against attempted frauds I as well sa for the benefit I of honest claimants These valuable collections are now in 0 building which is peculiarly exposed to the danger of destruction by fire I is I therefore earnestly recommended that an appropriation be made for a I new Ore proof building adequate for the present needs and reasonable fu I ture expanson of tbaaa valuqble col I lection Such buildings should be I u n r nrn f ln nnonH u v Uy lure for more architectural display is required I is believed that a suit able structure can bo erected at a cost not to exceed 250000 AS APPEAL TOS GHAKT I commend to the attention of Ctougrea the greatservicca of the com mander in glue ot our armies dur ing the war la the Union whose wise firm ltd pairioio conduct did r much to bring that momentous conflict to a oloae The legislation of the United States contains many pre oedenU for recognition ot distin guished military merit authorizing lank and emolument to be conferred for eniineLit services to the country An ast ot Congress authorizing the appointment ot a captain general of the army with suitable provisions re lating t compensation retirement and other details would in my jUdg mont be altogether fitting and pro per and would be warmly approved by the country countryTE THE NAVY Tha report of the secretary of the navy exhibits the successful and satisfactory management of that de partment during the last fiscal year The total expenditures for the year were 12916639 leaving unexpen ded at tie close of the year 2141 6S2 of the amount available The appropriations for the present fiscal year endlrg June 30ih 1881 are 15 095001 and the total estimate for tbe next fiscal year ending Juno i 30th 1882 aro 15953751 The amount drawn by warrant tram July let 1SSO to November Htb 3SSJ is 5041570 Gl570LSA ALASKA Tho recommendation of the secre tary of the navy that provision be made for the establishment of some form of civil government for the people of Alaska i < approved At the present there is no protection of persons or property in that territory except such as is offered by officers of the United States ship Jamestown This vessel was dispatched t Sitka bsciusa of the fear that without the immediate presence of national autho rity there was impending danger of anarchy The steps taken to restore order have bean accepted in good faith by both white and Indian in habitant mid tho necessity for the m Oi of restraint does not in my Opinion now exist II however the Jamettotcn should b withdrawn leaving our people as at present without the ordinary judicial and administrative authority of organized local gore ninent serious conse quences might ensue The laws provide only for the collection of revenue protertba of public prop erty and tbo transmission of mails The problem is to apply local rue I for a population so scattered and peculiar in its origin and con dition The natives are re ported to be tractable and 1 prtej ctbla self supporting and i properly instructed doubtless wonli advance rapidly in civilization and I new factor of pros I perity would b added to the national life I therefore recommend le remmend requi site legislation upon this subject r Toe secretary of tho navy baa taken etepa towards the establishment of M naval coaling stations at theIsthmus J of Panama to meet the requirement f of our commercial relations with i Central and South America which are rapidly growing in importance M Locations eminently suitable both as I regards our naval purposes and the I i ages of commerce have been selected one on tho cast side of the Isthmus nt Ohiziqai Lagoon in the Caribbean 54 Sea and the other on tho Pacific et the Bay of Golfito Golfto The only cafe 4 harbors sufficiently commodious on T the Isthmus are at these point and the distance between them is less than 100 mite The report of the secretary of the navy concludes with valuable suggestions with reaped to Li I tbe building up of our merchant marina service and which deeervea the favorable consideration of Con rees POST OFFICE DEPAETMENT The report of the postmaster general exmbits a continual growth nd high state of efficiency of the I postal service Tbe operations of no department of government perhaps represent with greater exactness the increase of the population and busi ness of the country In laW the postal receipts were 8518067 in 1880 the receipts were 33315479 All tbe inhabitants of the country are directly and personally interested in naving proper mail facilities and naturally watch the poitofSoe very elosely This careful oversight on he part of the people baa proved a Constant atimuloaa to improvement During the putt year there was an increase of 2134 pcetofhces and the mal routes were extended 27177 miles making an additional mnual transportation of 10804191 Tiiles The revenues of tbe postal lervtce for the enduing year arc estimated mated at 38 845174 and expendi tures at 42475932 leaving a deficiency ciency to be appropriated out of the treasury of 630757 The universal postal union has received the approved of almost all the countries and colonies of the world maintaining an organized postal service and it is cocflJently expected that all the countries and colonies now outside of tne union will coon unite herewith thus realizing the grand idea and aim of the founders of the union of forming for tne purpose of inter national mail cotnmunicatian a single postal territory embracing the world with a complete uniformity of postal charges and conditions of inter national exchange for 1 descriptions aud correspondence To enable the United States to do its full shares of this gieat work additional legis lation is asked by the postmaster general to whose recommendation etpecial attention is called The lug elton of the postmaster general that i would be wile to Encourage by appropriate Segiilation tho establish ment of American lines of steamers Ameroan seamers by our own citizens to carry mails between our own ports and those of Mexico Central America South America and of trans Pacific coun tries ia i commended to the serious eerous consideration of f Congress The at tention of Congress is also invited to tbe suggestion of tho postmaster general in regard to postal savings 

TEDEEAL COURTS Tho necessity for additional provi sions to aid in the transaction of the buninetc of federal courts becomes each year more apparent The dockets of the Supreme Court and of tbo circut court in the greater num ber of the circuits are encumbered with the constant accessions of cases In the former curt and in many instances in the circuit courts years intervene before it ia practicable to bring cases to a hearing The at torneygeneral recom mends the es tablishment of an intermediate court of errors and appeals I is recom mended that tbe number of judges of tbe circut court in each circuit with the exception of tbe second circuit should be increased bj the additions of another judge in the tocond circuit that two should ba added and that intermediate appellate courts should be formed in each circuit to consist of the circuit judge and circuit jus tice and that in the event of the ab sence ol either of these judges the place of the absent judge should be supplied by the judge of one of the district courts in the circuit Such appellate court could be safely invested with Urge jurisdiction onri ifa roiinn nlr tl itn nr wuu uuw aUD in many cases where appeals would i still be allowed to thoSuprome Court The expense incurred for this inter mediate court will require a vary aoderAte increase ot the appropria tions for the expenses of the depart ment of justice This recommenda tion is commended to tbe careful con sideration of Congress I is evident that the delay of justice iu many in stances oppressive and disastrous to Euitoranow necessarily occurs in Fed remedied eral court which will in this way be ISDIAK AFFAIRS The report of the secretary of the interior presents an elaborate account to tho operations of that department during tbe past year It lves me re plensuro to say that our Indian 8f irs appear to be in a more hopeful condition now then over before The Indians have made gratifying prog ress in agriculture herding and me chanical pursuits Many nho were a few year ago in hostile conflict with tbe government are quietly Bat tling down on farms where they hope to make their permanent hornet and are building houses and are engaging in the occupations of civilized life The introduction of freighting among them has been re markably fruitful of good results in giving many of them congenial and remunerative employment and in stimulating their ambition to eRr their own support Their honeety fidelity and efficiency as carriers are uiphlj praised The organization of a police force of Indians bai been I equally successful in maintaining law aud order on the reservttion and in exercisidg a wholesome moral icflu euca among the Indians themselves I concur with the secretary of the interior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be increased a p an inducement to tbe bt class of yonnjj men to enter it Much care and attention has ben devoted to the enlargement of the educational facil ities of the Indians The means available for this important object have been very inadequate A fWjad dittonalborirding schools a the Indian agency have bern established and the erection of buildings begun for several more but an increased appropriation or this interesting undrit king i greatly needed to accommodate the large number of Indian children of school age The number offered by their parents from all parts of the runty for education in government schools is murh larger than can be accommodated with the means n present available for that Ivni ths purpose The number Indian pupils at the Normal School at Hampton Va under the direction of Gen Arm strong has been considerably in creased and their progress is highly encouraging The Indian school es tablished by the interior department in 1879 at Carlisle Penn under the direction of Captain Pratt has ben successful I has now nearly 200 pupils of both seses representing the great variety of lives l cut of the Becky Mountains The pupils in both these institutions receive not not only an elementary English edu cation but are instructed in house work agricultural and useful me chanical pursuits A similar school was established this year at Forest Giove Oregon for the edu cation of tee Indian youth oa the Pacific Coait In addi tion fo this thirtysix Indian boys and girls were selected from the east ern Cerobecs and placed in board ing schools in North Carolina where they aro to receive an elementary English education and training in industrial pursuits The interest shown by Indian parents even among the so called wild tribes in the educa tion of their children is very gratify ing and gives promise that the results j accomplished by the cHarta now I making will be of lasting benefit Tbe expenses of Indian education have so far been drawn from the per manent civilization fund at the dis posal of the department of the interior poa rior but the fund is now eo much reduced that a continuance ot this bentficial work will in future be de pendent on a specific appropriation by Congress for the purpose and I venture to express the hope that Con gress will not permit institutions BO fruitful of good results to perish for want of means for their support On tbe contrary an increase of the number of euch schools ap pears to me highly advisable The past year baa been unusually free from disturbances aoaong the Indian tribes An agreement has been made witi the Utes by which they surrender their large reservation in Colorado in consideration ot an an nuity to be paid them and agree to settle in severity on certain lands designated for that purpose as farmers holding individual titles to their lands in tea simple inalienable for a certain period In this way r costly Indian wr baa been avoided which at one time seemed imminent and for the first time in the history of the country tm Indian nation has given up its tribal existence to settle m severally and live as individuals under the c mon protection of the laws of the country Tbe conduct of the Indiana tbrougout the country during the past year with but few noteworthy exceptions has been or derly and peaceful The guerilla war fare carried on for two years by Vic torio and his band of Southern Apaches has virtually come to end by the death of that chief and moat of his followers on Mexican soil The disturbances caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull and his men who had taken refuge in the British domin ions are also likely to cease A large majority of his followers have surren dered to our military forces and tbe mitary remainder arc apparently in a state I I of disintegration I concur with the secretary of the interior in expressing the earnest hope that congress will before the close of the session take favorable action on the bill providing for the allotment ot lands on different reservations in toveralty to Indians with patents conferring a fee simple title inalienable for a certain period and the eventual disposition of the residue of the reservations for general settlement with the consent and for the ben ¼ fit of the Indians placing the latter under the equal protection of the laws of the country Thi method together with a vigorous prosecution ofour educational efforts will work 1 most important and et fectic advance toward the tolution of the Indian problem and in pre paring for the gradual incorporation of oar Indian population into tbe great 1 body ot agrarian citizcnsahip I PUBLIC LANDS A largo increase is reported in the 1 disposal of public lands for settle ment during the past year which I marks tbe prosperous growth of our agricultural industry and a vigorous i movement cf the population toward our unoccupied land As this move ment proceeds the codification of our land laws I a well as proper legislation to regulate the disposition of public Undsbecome of more pressing neces sity and I therefore invite considara tion of Congress to the report and tbe accompanying draft of a bill made by the public lands commission which were communicated by mo tj Con gress at the list I session Early ac tion upon this important subject is highly desirable TIMBER LANDS The attention of Congress is again asked to the wasteful depredations committed on our public timber lands and the rapid and indiscriminate de struction of or forests Urgent ne occuLT for legislation t the end that this may be prevented it i now gener ally recognized in view of the lawless character ot the depredations com mitted and the ditaitrons conse quences which will inevitably follow their continuance Legis lation again and again has been recommended to arrest the evil and preserve for tho people of our western states and territories the timber needed for domestic and other pur poses GEOLOGICAL AND MINERAL SURVL The report of the director ol geo logical 1 surveys is a document of un usual interest The consolidation of the various geological and geo graphiccal turvojc rod exploring enterpriaS each of which has here tofore operated upon an independent plan without concert cannot fail r be of great benefit to all those indus dustries of ha country which de pend upon the development of our mineral resources Toe labors of the scientific men ot recognized merit who compose the corps of geological survey during the first season of their field operations and inquiries appear to have been very comprehensive and will soon b3 communicated to Con ercsi in a number of volumes Ibe director of surveys recommends that the investigations carried on by his bureau which so far has been con fined 10 the gocalled public land Elates and territories be extended over the entire coun eotre try and that the necessary appropriation be made for this purpose This would be particularly beneficial to iron coal and to the other mining interests of the Missia eippi valley and of the eastern nd southern states The subject is com mended to the careful consideration of Congress PUBLIC BUILDINGS Toe secretary of the interior ache attention to the want of room in the I public building of tho capital now i existing and iu progress 01 construc I tion tor the accommodation of tbo I clerical force employed on tho public record Necessity has compelled the renting of private buildings in I 1 different parts of the city for the lo J cation of public offices for which a large amount of rent is annually paid while tho separation of offices belonging to the sme depart ment impedes the trans action of current businosr The B C retary suggests that the block sur rounding Lafayatte Square on the east north and west be purchased as a site for 1 new edifice for the accommoda I tion of government office leaving the square itself intact and that if such buildings were constructed upon an harmonious plan of architecture they would add very much to the beauty of the national capitol and would together with the treasury and now Bttttv navy and war department buildings form one of the meet im world posing groups of public edifices in the TEA AND 

SUGAR The commissioner of agriculture expresses the confident belief that his eflorts in behalf the production of i our own sugar and tea have been en I couragingly rewarded The impoit ance of the results attained have at tracted marked attention at home and have received special considera tion from foreign notions The EUC cesaful cultivation of our own tea and the manufacture of our own sugar would make a difference of many millions of dollars annually in the e 1th of the nation 

CATTLE DISEASE The commissioner ak altenI ton particularly to the conj I tinned prevalence of infectious and contagions cattle diseases known in Europe and ASIA as the cattle plague or pleuropneumonia A mid type of this disease in the present condition of our country is the occasion of great loss to our farmers and a serious disturbance to our trade with Great Britain whicn furnishes a market for most of our live stock and dressed meats Tne value of cattle exported from the United States for tbo eight month ended August 31 1880 was more than 127000000 and nearly double tbe value for the lame period in 1879 an unexampled increase in tbe ex port trade Your eirly attention is solicited to this important matter PUBLIC AKD INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS The commissioner of education re ports a continue increase of public interest in educational affairs and that the public schools generally throughont the country are well cur tamed Industrial training uattraotint deserved at cation and colleges or in struCtion theoretically and practically in agriculture mechanics and arts including the govern m ant a hoth I re oently established for the instruction of Indian youths are gamingetcadil in public estimation The commie eioner aikj special attention to the depredations committed in the lands reserved for the future support ol public instruction aud totbe very great need of help from the nation for schools in the territorial end in tbe southern states Tho recom inundation heretofore made it re peated and it is urged that an edu cational fund be set apart from the net proceeds of the sales of publio lands annually the income of ffhich shall be distributed on some satis factory plan to the states and territo ries and the District of Columbia The ucce3 i of tne public schools ol tbo District of Columbia and the progress made under the intelligent direction of the board of education and superintendent in supplying tbe educational requirements of the district with thoroughly trained and efficient teachers is very gratifying
