C.—I'voh il)!y the most. inconsis'em message over de- 'i\en to congress is a fair character­ ization of the president's advice to tho session which began on Deceniliei J. Some ol '.hi! politicians allege thai 1 composed by members of the cabinet rather than by the president. and tin- inconsisiency may relied the differing views of cabinet members. It i.-. also marki'd by genera lilies which can be interpreted in lnanv vvays and tew specific reeoninn n dat:ons. At firs 1 congress is told thai iihivsi is a superficial matter to be remedied by passing the peace treaty, (loins something to abate profiteering und -shutting up radicals. Then there is a magnificent passage which goes to tin very root of the matter and showing that fundamental, changes are need ed I'vucs I'-iIini Hill i- 1 !u e,:.-.t discussion of our prob lems is advised, and on the oilier hand congress :a urged to pass the vicious Palmer .substitute for the espionage bill which would close the mouths ol progressives as well as the voice of radical opinion. Freer trade is urged to bring about better international conditions and ai the same, time new protection plan: for several lines of trade.

The Lane plan for putting soldiers on the land and the providing of em ployment. service for the returned men .............. Hotter regulation of colli storage. More democracy in industry. Passing of peace treaty. In view of the fact thai the Repub licans control congress the president message will probably have little ef fect. The Republicans in the senate threaten to lay the peace treaty on tjie itable and take up domestic issues un less the president offers some basis for compromise. He has not. as wt receded from his position to "take it or leave" which he declared for from the beginning. Conservatives iitil Radicals People who have been afraid all along that labor might becom'c radical have a good deal to think about in the present coal situation. The strike is the weapon of conservative labor. Po litical action is the major waepon urged by most of the so-called danger ous radicals like Debs, Morris Hi'.quit and Thomas Van Lear. The conserva tive leaders have preached cratt union ism and alliance with old-party lead ers, with the strike as the means of securing bettor conditions in the trade. Conservative labor, as represented by Gompers, Lewis of the miners and other federation chiefs, had had to call two big strikes, the steel strike and the coal strike, which bring g.-eat distress to the public. Their political "friends" have failed them absolutely. The politicians have refused to, do a thing to bring the trust officials to terms. If, on the other hand, labor had t.i.l: en up independent political action years ago, it would now have consid erable power in the government. It could have raised an effective voice against war profiteering, it could have kept wages up to the cost of liv ing by regulation, and the country would bo immensely better off. Labor would not now have to strike to keep the children from going Iv.in- A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year V. A.
