The great ?c<ly which, according to *he theory of the American constitution, purport* especially to represent the pooolc, met to-day'at noon, lu their accustomed hall. Long before tbo hour of assemblage a densely crowded throng of specta tors looked down upon the most numerous He i9e of Coonmenera eyer witnessed in America. The scene wt3 Interesting and not easily to- fr. for gotten. There were TUB ORF.AT'TARTY REAPERS who Tre^c voted away "the people's money- in posed taxes, changed the constitution, impowofc d An drew-Johnson, reconstructed the South, eniian ehtaod the African and enacted tariffs, bankinr laws, bankrupt acne and given away <rtch and brood empires ton ha mammoth railroad corpora tione?all of them moving about the trad r.nd shak ing hands with each other as eagerly ae If PLEASANT flAlBTTINGS AND HAN I?VH< KINGS wore the one great obiect In life, Blaire, Gur5eld, I Drwes, Butlerrjind Kelley were all In pie ce, and Uur ing the long parliamentary day went as coolly through thelr*rerr>ectlv.c parts as if their persoual and pollticalrrelatIons had never been a subject of speculation.<tur anxiety. AU went "merrily as a marriage 11011."" Over on the democratic side there loomed uptrjio-ViU form and swarthy face o/Beck, tlie erect 'figure of Fernando Wood, the rotund, jolly Rob ptsoc of Illinois; the striking, thoughtful Lamar, ?f Mississippi; the eager, oustllng, lithe Sunset < Joxi'of New York, while directly la front of the ! t leaker the form of ALEXANDER HAMILTON STTPI1ENS, irall a nd feeble, but enshrining a great intellect challsi ? acl the interest of aU observers. The htll Itself Ay.neared to have expanded to the new de mands i-tpou it. The old, heavy and unsightly desks tiiad txxen removed and new ones substituted, ^rseatly fir proving the appearance of the floor. Event-Ring looked new, fresh and bright. The diplomatic gallery had been ohanged aver tc the of the hall, while to the right of the re porters' gallery a special flection had been set ftpuvTi fcr the families of members of Congress. The Tapirters' gallery, an usual on important ?cannons, had been allowed to be overrun with the usual crowd of bummers, loafers and mis cellaneous females and stragglers. Even overhead tin-re--was a change, and for the better, which a Bowed a fall soft light, as the day wans J, to be thrown, down upon tne hall. f CLERK M'PILEKSON RAVPED TO CRDTR and ca'ied the roll. Nearly every member was in Ills pie ce. The Louisiana members and two dis tricts from Arkansas and two Irom West Y irginia were omitted as lacking the usual prirci facie oare. As soon as"this form was concluded Mr. May nard .ose and moved to go into an election for 6peat,er. declining to give way to Sunset Cox lor another and different purpose. This carried, Mr. MayT ard uomliated Mr. Blaine. Mr. N!bl&cK nomi nated Fernando Wood, while the spectators looked lor tl e democratic bolt which, It was reported, wss oout to be disclosed. After a pause Mr. Hol mur. nominated Mr. Cox, of New Y'ork, who briefly declined. THE VOTE WAS THEN TAKEN . and exhibited a good deal ol discipline in the re publican side of the House. Blaine received every republican vote in the Chamber, and also two libe ral republican?namely, Eroinberg's, of Alabama, and General Bannlng's, of Ohio. Whitehonse. liberal, from New Y'ork, voted for Cox. as did also the irate and determined Holman. Mr. Stephens wu3 complimented with a vote, and Mr. Wood, of New York, voted for Heyeri-r Climer, ol Pennsyl vania, receiving himself nearly the entire demo cratic vote?77 in number. The bolt-tad evidently fizzicd out. BLAINE WAS NOW ESCCETEP TO THE CHAIR, and his speech was one et the moat noteworthy events of the day?clear, genial and with a broad patriotic ring that made a good platform from ?which to bound lightly into the Presidential race. The impression on the President makers in lront war evidently good. Dawes next. In solemn lorm and sepulchral tones, expurgated the good na tnved Speaker of all rebellious and dlsloyn1 antecedents, the ex-Vice President of the Soothern Confederacy calmly surveying this curious and ridiculous ceremony. Next the .members were sworn In groups. Butler, Dawes, "Woo-J, Cox, nelfltcr Clymer, lollowed by six natty litUe mulatoes, who hat! jupt rejoiced In a good breakfast at Willard's, among all the white folks; And then some fifty-two ex-Confederates came for ward to take the modified oath, the wasted form ?4>f Steohens leaning on his colleague in the centre ?of a gi onp of Southerners. Little time was wasted THE 

REMAINDER OF THE nOfKE ORGANIZATION, -dr. MoPherson and the other republican nominees being pnt through by a resolution, the yeas and mays being called to let the democrats vote for the brilliant ticket presented by Saturday nights' caucus; and now comes some routine motions^ which meant evidently more than such usually do, Dawes being recognized by Mr. Blaine to move for thetosual notice to the Senate ?f an organization. *nd Mr. Garfield for a committee to Inform the President and receive his Message. Motions indt cntRic, in the opinion of all, that these gentlemen would- continue to fill the Important places on com mittees they have hitherto held. The swearing in of the Territorial delegates gave rise to a *harp con test over 

CANNON, THE MORMON, whole-reported to have only four wives. Merrtam, of New York, a siern loe to such monopolies, moved to send Cannon to the limbo of the Com mittee on Elections; but Cox, Butler, Hoar, Potter and liaynanl carried the House with them lor recognising the hard-hearted and much-married Mormox upon Me prima .facie title, and so he ?wore like mi the rest. The House next eagerly insisted on LOCATINO TTIE SEATS By a propot and graceful courtesy exception were made in favor ol Mr. Dawes as the senior member of the House and Mr. Stephens by reason of his age, to fir ml ties and long services, and thus those gentlemen had the plates they warned. The reet had to abide the lottery. Mes<rs. Negley, Eld ridge and Scofleld came early and oicked good places. Mr. Laruar took Mr. Beck s scat and held It ror him till bis turn came. Holman and Mll'on Taylor had good luck. Mr. Ciymer purposely look a back ?cat, as did Mr. Harlay, while Mr. uat'lcia bad to do the same from mcessUy. Mr. Batler came late, and finding all the jood seats op the radical side occupied, marched over, amid general laughter and ap plause, yid took up his quarters among the de. raot-acy. Messrs. Maynard and Hyoper had to 'ollow suit. THE ONLT 9CENB that disclosed any party feeling during the day grew nut 01 the resolve ol the republicans to send the case of Messrs. Shanks and Kna-pp, from the Ninth dvtrlctoJ Indiana, to the Committee on Elec tions. ip vain did tne democracy insist and nrgo that Mr. Knapp had a prima facts case; in vain did ? hey ask for time. The confllet led to two yea ?ml nay votes at a season when all were wearied out and hungry, but the republicans triumphed, of course, in the end. VARIOUS COMMENTS 'are made on the day's proceedings-one, that there publicans, having a large majority, will role rough shod over their oppopeuts, and thus create ? bitter ami ugly feeling during the session; the ether, nvv a distinguished democrat. is a lament ?vei the ofbsenca of s leader aud o-gauizauno ou rib rtrte of hoR?f in contrast to the discipline and ample preparation of tbe opposition, Mr. Butler evidently propos?*?o force in the Kellogg mem bers from Loufelona to-morrow || his party will Pact Mm in the'cndcavor. There are Blgns of a ?wn<y and a wtter session everywhere, and the Bponker will "plainly have need of his gavel and the qukA will iftich has so often borne down the un ruly crowd. A tvosy Day la tbe Senate. The meeting of the Senate to day, save that It ' '?as the beginning of a new Congress, did not possess any more real interest than during a proBy debate. Senator Carpenter presided most of tiro time the Seuate was in session. Senator Runner waa congratulated on all sideB for Irs re covery and vigorous appearance. Senator Brown low. still feeble ami irrtrm, was in his seat. The caucus to-morrow will not, It Is thought, change *ny of the committees. The election of an execu tive clerk, for which there are many oandidatea, and a chaplain are fhe only offices to be Ailed. Unimportant Uiplomntlc Correspondence ArrompsnyUg the President** A1 es se ge?Secretary Fi*H'* Lilt Instruc tions to Minister Sickles Itt Behalf of the Cuban Insurgents. Toe diplomatic correspondence accompanying the President's Message is, so far as the printed volume goes, unimportant, and does not relate to the more recent action of our government In regard - to Spanish rnle in Cnba. In a letter addressed ' by Secretary Fish to Minister Sickles August 27 last?he says that "previous despatches from Madrid are not calculated to com mand confidence in the expectation of a satisfac tory settlement ot the troubles in which Spain fLr.de herself involved, either In respect to her ltiternal or colonial atfhlrs or her relations with ether Powers. As to the former wo can bnt sin cerely regret that the effort to establish a republican form of government does not give greater promise of success. The United States promptly and cordially extended its recognition and the moral effects of its sympathy to the new government. It hn9 further manifested Its friendly interest by abstaining from Insistence m the presentation of complaints, on account of the frequent failure of compliance with assurances of Intended reiom In the government of Cuba and of the reparation of wrongs done to the persons and property of American citizens. Keoent information from Havana shows that the decree for the release of the embargoed estates had not at a very late date been proclaimed, and that influence seemed to be at work to induce the withholding of the publication and the consequent nullification of the de cree. ? ? ? The President has heard with deep concern and regret the announcement said to be made by a member of the Ministry of Spain, that no reforms will be granted and no notice taken of the demands of the Insurgents In Cuba as long as they do not lay down their arms. ? ? ? In the interest of Spain no less than In that of Cnba; in .the interest of the United States in the Interest of humanity. The President hopes that such may not be the deter mination of Spain, and yon will not fall to urge upon the Ministry the tendency of such policy and the Importance in this direction of pacification and , the arrest of the further destruction of property an<i the waste of human life; of the disavowal or abandonment of a policy so inconsistent with the possibility of a restoration of peace. ? ? ? it is, therefore, that It appears to us, as friends of Spain, of urgent importance that Spain, in the exercise of her historic wisdom, voluntarily recall the incon siderate declaration of a Minister (ir, indeed, it were made), that the granting of reforms to Cuba will not be entertained while the Insurrection lasts, and the President desires that you impress in a friendly and delicate way, the paramount im portance of action rather than promise in the di rection of reforms, of wulch the wisdom of the government at Madrid have more than once re cognized the propriety." The subsequent correspondence with our Minis ter at Madrid relates more directly to the exlstlte troubles in the island of Cuba, and is reserved to accompany a message to Congress whenever the present negotiations are regarded as settled. Attorney General Williams To Be Chiel Justice. During the session of the Cabinet to-day the President formally tendered to Attorney General Williams the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, that gentle man, as he afterwards said, having received no previous Intimation of the designation. Judge Wil liams thanked the President for conferring upon him this nonor, as the position was the highest civil office in his gift, and at the same time the most !Tr,nt ,eV. H? exprc85eJ hls re*r? at retiring from the cabinet, with the members of which he had always been on the closest terms of friend ship and in official accord. His colleagues con gratulated him on the appointment, while they were sorry to part with him as a Cabinet officer Colonel Brlstow To Be Attorney General Colonel B. H. Bristow. of Kentucky, who was the first Solicitor General under the law establishing the Department of Justice, and who, over a year ago, resigned that office, will be appointed Attorn*. 5% 'IS The President's Sleusgc To Be Sent To day. The Cabinet met at half-past eleven o'clock, all the members being present, an 1 remained in ses sion until twenty minutes of lour o'clock, in ex pectation of receiving the Joint committee of the Benate and ilonse of Representatives instructed with the dnty of informing the President the two houses had organized, and were prepared to receive any communication he might be pleased to make them. The committee not appearing by half-past three o'clock, a telegram was sent to the Capitol inquiring into the Rtate of aifairs in Con gress, and on receipt of the reply the private secretary of the President iniormed the gentlemen of tne press in waiting for copies of the Message that the document would Dot be sent to Congress until to morrow. They bad beeu there at least three hours, besides a full force of operators were at the instruments in the telegraph office to transmit the message over the wires, and they were similarly disappointed, but there Is no question the docu ment will be sent to Congress probably between tweive and one o'clock to-morrow. Secretary Richardson's Report. Secretary Richardson had sent advance copies of his financial roport to New York, Philadelphia and Boston to be distributed to the press at the time the President's Message should be delivered to Congress; but, owing to the President's Message not having been communicated to Congres to-day, the Secretary this afternoon telegraphed to the government officers having his report in charge to retain u until to-morrow. Movement to Amend the Back Pny Bill? 95.000 and Kxtrae. Sixteen republican members of the House to-day requested Mr. Maynard, the Chairman of the re publican caucus, to call a meeting to-night to take action on the Increased Pay bllL There were about 116 members present, and after speeches, all or a harmonious tenor, a committee, consisting of Messrs. Kaason, Trcmalne, Hale, Butier, and Tbowas, of Nortn Carolina, was appointed to {"alt a bill embodying a resolution ad/opted, to the effect that the pay of members of Congress should >>e from tne 4th or March, 187 3. at the rate of $6,000 per axuum, together with alloarauce of stationery sod actual travelling expenses. As the bill now sutjfiH the pay is $7,600 per annum Arid no allowance whatever. Smntury Richardson Recommends Bo Inflation of the Currency. The Secretary of the Treasury, In his forthcoming report, takes positive ground against inflation or tne currency, and says that such an evil should be avoided, especially as It Is the Intent of previous legislation to make the legal tender redeemable In coin at the earliest practicable period. He recommends '.hut Congress fix the amount oi a eserve, 10 be used bv the Secretary o the Treasury oniy in certain case's and under cerf tain restrictions, which it is lor Congress to de termine.

Important Meeting of the Committee of One Hundred?A Mandamus To Be Ap plied for to Compel the Throwing Open of the Boohs. The Newark Citizens' Committee of One Hundred held an Important special meeting last night. The attendance, both of members and of citizens, was 1 unusually large, and nrnch enthusiasm and earnest ness was manifested in the proceedings. A cor; rcspondence was read between the Chairman or the committee and Mayor Kicord, in wnich the Mayor was earnestly requested to exercise nls authority In compelling the officials to throw open their books to the committee. The Mayor's reply was a shifting, wishy-washy letter, setting forth his earnest desire to aid the committee, but i promising no action. It was of the old Dackboneless stripe. The committee on Auditor's accounts pre sented a report, which was unanimously adopted, utterly disposing of the semi-official explanations by the officials of the exposures tn former reports. A committee was appointed to consult legal ad vice in regard to going before the conrts and ap plying for a mandamus to compel the officials to throw open their books. Chairman Courier made a stirring speech, in which he clearly showed that If t e credit ol the city was Injured the blame rested on the officials. AN ADDRESS to the citizens at large was reported upon favor ably by a sueoial committee and ordered issued. The address is a calmly worded and careiully condensed resume' of the work accomplished by the committee from Its organization two and a hall mouths ago up to the date ol the arrogant refusal of City Auditor Dawes to allow the Committee of Experts to examine his accounts, Ac,, the object of the committee lelng to state direct to the people in Its own language the pith of what has been discovered. The reason given is that the local press has been divided seriously In Its treat ment of the committee and its work, the greater portion treating it most unfairly, and the lesser portion too kindly, perhaps, according as it best suited the policy of the papers. "In the first place," says the address, "It must be kept steadily in view that the committee was com missioned by the people to make a thorough lnvos 1 tigation into the financial and other department 1 affairs of the city, and to see whether the people's I work had been doue properly and honestly?not as some persons seem to thtnk, to act as public prose cutors and convict certain persons of s>tate prison offences." Then follows a brlei and succinct state ment of what lias been discovered by the commit tee In regard to the finances. "The committee," says the addre?s, "through Its sub-commit tee on auditor's accounts, has discovered ample evidence I to warrant it in making the following positive statement, to witThat on a comparison alone of the printed reports of officials there have been found a series ot bond and balance discrepancies which are GROSSLY AT VARIANCE with good, plain, simple and honest business con duct?discrepancies, which. It found by any Armor corporation In the accounts oi their servants, would surely result In their being discharged and branded, at least, as incompetent." The result of the Investigation in financial matters is summed up in the statement "that the conduct and man agement of the financial affairs or the city, at least in many notable instances, have not been in ac cordance with good business principles or even with law." Regarding its revelations on the transactions ol commissioner "Joe" Young, It is set forth that enongli evidence has been discov ered "to show conclusively that the knowledge obtained by Mr. Y'oung tn his capacities as a paid city official has been frequently used, not tor the best interests of the city and citizens generally, but lor the personal interest AND MONETARY PROFIT of a few persons, past and present city officials and their connections, and that, too, In a manner that. If not positively punishable by law as a crime, Is, to say the least, unjust, scandalous and dis graceful In the worst degree." It closes with an appeal for continued co-operation on iha part of citizens.
