Pious Indians use the Bibles which ! the Government baj issued to them for gun-vvdding. Many Christians have been known to put the Bible to no use at all. The trouble with a certain class in this city is that they have no respect or fear of the law and hold honesty and capacity in contempt. The reme dy is for honest and capable citizens to enforce the law. Veneration for old age, we pre ) sume, is the reason why the American press has so little to say in the way of criticism concerning Lydia Thompson, who has recently arrived in this coun try.

The St. Louis Republican, of Satur day morning, contained .an advertise ment of a St. Louis business bouse which occupied four pages of that paper. It is safe to say that the firm will reap four-fold benefit. Advertis ing liberally will always bring in a full return for the outlay. We rejoice in the conviction that no mischance i3 likely to deprive the Nation of Mr. Cleveland's services. Nevertheless, in common with the great body of the Democratic party we should like to see the Presidential succession so arranged that whenever a vacancy occurs the officer designated to act as President shall belong to the party in power. Shot in the Back. About 1 o'clock yesterday evening as Mr. William Roberta was returning to the Refuge Mill, from dinner, when near the mill he was shot, and it is feared fatally wounded by some one unknown to the unfortunate mar). Tne shot was Dred from the bushes on the rode side where the assassin was concealed . Roberts was hit in the left side, near the spine which it struck. The wound is considered extremely dangerous. Roberts was taken to the residence of Mr. Dave Kennedy, on Pearl street. Mr. Roberts states that he has not the slightest idea' who committed the dastardly deed, as he has bad no difficulty with any pert on. THE 

DEATH OF THE HON. JfiHN PERKINS, Which occurred in Baltimore on Sunday the 29th ultimo, marks the passing away of an old land mark in Louisiana, and the final extinction of a name long and honorably connected with the history of that State. Judge Perkins was the eldest son of the late John Perkins, Esq., who was for many years, not only a leading citizen but one of the most intelligent, the wealthiest and most extensive cotton planters in the entire Southwest. Born to a princely fortune, Judge Perkins enjoyed all the educational advantages that wealth can procure, and as he was endowed by nature with rare intellectual gifts.tbe young Louisi anian made the most of his splen did opportunities. Graduating with distinction at that ancient seat of learning, Yale College, young Perkins passed at once to the law school of Harvard University at Cambridge. Massachusetts. Graduating with honor at that eminent legal school, he spent two years with the Hon. George M. Dillas, one of the most dis tinguished lawyers of Philadelphia, and who a few years later became Vice-President of the United States. Having completed his legal train ing, Mr. Perkins returned to Louisiana and established him self in the practice of his pro fession in the city of New Orleans. The bar of New Orleans was then in its glory. With John H. Grymes, Randall Hunt, Judah P. Benjamin, Sargent S. Prentiss, Pierre tioule, Ettienne Mazureau, Christian Rozelius and Isaac T. Preston in full practice, the bar of the Crescent City presented an array of genius, eloquence and ju clicial learning that was cert tiinJj t surpassed by aDy city of this broad Uuion. That young Perkins was able successfully to encounter that splend id galaxy of intellect and learning, none who knew the man and his vast mental resources ever doubted, but, alas! he lacked the spur, the incitiment of those "twin jailers of the heart, low birth and iron fortune." Beared in the lap of luxury, he lacked the grand incentive to success as a lawyer, and hene he turned to travel, and to study in another and a noble sphere, the science of government and statesman ship. Having made an extended tour of Europe and the Orient, he returned to London and to Paris, where he became a most intelligent and inter ested listener to the debates of the intellectual Titans in the Englise Par liament and the French Chamber of Deputies. With a mind strengthened and enriched by extensive travel and discriminative observation, Mr. Perkins .returned to Louisiana like Pallas, "lull armed," lor any iuttllee tual emergency. He was not how ever, long permitted ito enact the role lot a recluse and a dreamer, Loui siana called him to a position, for which years of study had amply pre pared him. As a J udge of the Circuit Court be bad a wide field for the dis play of his rare intellectual powers, and the vast store of legal attainments he bad gathered in his earlier years. His career on the Bench was all that could have been desired. A profound knowledge of the law went hand in hand with the loftiest integrity, and when he laid down the unsullied ermine of the Judge, he took up, at the com mand of the people of his native State, the robes of a Representative in the Congress of the United States, where he served two terms before the great war between the States convulsed the land and bathed it in blood. The service of Judge Perkins in the House of Representatives gave him an opportunity to Introduce and have passed, a law revising and improving our Consular system, 8 system which stands to-day a monument to his wis dom and Statesmanship. Retiring from the Halls of Congress in 1861, Judge Perkins was promptly elected by the people of Madison Parish as their delegate and Repieseta tive in the Secession Convention of that iyear. From this post of honor and usefulness he was soon transferred to a broader theatre, and was sent to Montgomery as one of the Representatives of Louisiana in the Confederate Congress, a position wbich be held until the cause to which he was devoted went down in dark- ness and blood. After the collapse of the govern ment of the Confederate States of America, Judge Perkins retired to Mexico, from whence he soon went to Europe, where he remained for several years. When he returned to the United r States a few years since, he returned wim g.eauy impaired health, the sight of one eye gone, and a once princely fortune reduced to a moderate competency. The disease, which destroyed the sight of one eye soon attacked the other, and for several years he has been totally blind, envel oped in utter darkness. Judge Perkins was distinguished for many winning and noble qualities, and his career through life was marked by the purest pa triotism, the loftiest integrity, a scorn of all that was mean and petty, a love of all that was pure, ennobling and beautiful, and that "flowing courtesy" which distinguished the great English patriot John Hampden. In the death of the lion. John Per kins, Louisiana mourns the eclipse of one of her brightest and noblest, sons. He will, we learn, be buried in the cemetery at Natchez next week. His last resting place has been well chosen. Overlooking the great river he loved so well, he will sleep by the side of that majt-stic in land sea near which he was born, and as his infant ears were first greeted by the murmuring waves of that mighty stream, so shall its ceaseless billows, as they pour their wealth of waters into the Gulf of Mexico, '8 's eternal and never ending requiem. Peaceful be the rest and light the slumbers of an honorable and true man. OUR NEW POSTMASTER. We are gratified that Mr. William Groome, one of the stockholders of the Vicksburg Printing and Publish ing Company has been appointed Post master of this city by the President. This was done after the most careful investigation of all the charges made, and as the appointment was very ear nestly opposed by a very few young Democrats and a few corrupt Re publicans, Mr. Groome's character, capacity and record were closely scrutinized. That he came through unsmircbed is greatly to his credit. The Democrats who opposed him should now bow gracefully to the de cision of the highest authority in our party. Any farther opposition to Mr. Groome would be opposition to the Democratic administration, and could only end in injury to any Democrats taking part in it. The Evening Post is appealing to the Republican majority in the Senate, to defeat the will of the President and the Democratic party, in regard to this appointment. We are sure that it will not be sus tained in this course by any good Dem ocrat, and by very few good Repub licans. The many friends of Hon. II. 1). Money will be gratified to know that he is doing well in Washington in the practice of the law, and that his pros pects are brightening every day. Mr. Money, who was for years Chairman of the Committee of Postollice3 and Postroads in the House of Representa tives is associated with Hon. A. A. Freeman, who has eight years expe rience as Assistant U. S. Attorney General. The style of this strong firm is Freeman & Money, and they are located in the St. Cloud Building,' Washington D. C. They already have bad busiuess from nearly every State and Territory in the Union. While we are giving our attention to National affairs, we should not neg lect those which more directly concern us. This city is in a condition to prosper, but no city can prosper if it is cursed by misrule. If there is any citizen of average intelligence, who anticipates that city affairs will be managed with even ordinary capacity and good faith by some of the Alder men claiming to be elected and some really elected, we can only say we do not see on what he bases his anticipa tions. Our business men and property owners should give this matter serious thought. When it is known what Aldermen will take their seats in January we may refer to this subject again. We trust that the good citizens will make up their minds to insist on their rights and accept nothing less. If we can make a beginning by going to the root of our troubles and landing some con sumate scoundrelsin the penitentiary, the effect will be worth a million dol lars to the city of Vicksburg. 

WASHINGTON. The Opening of Congress Changes In the Membership Since the Last Session. Special to the H. O. Picayune. Washington, Dec. 7 The opening day of the session, and especially the first session of anew Cong'ress, is al ways the occasion of a great throng at the Capitol. The multitude, only half informed, have an idea that tbore win ue some special incident or dra matic situation which it would be a pity for them to miss. Every year it is the same thing. To-day the galleries were crowded to overllowlnir. and thouoh the rn- I ceeding developed little or nothing out me usual course ot tnmgs, tne peo ple lingered to the close. In the Senate the Republicans put old John Sherman in as presiding offi cer, all the Democrats voting for Mr. Harris, of Tennessee. The flower and boquet business, which has been a folly for years past, to-day received a large development, many of the senators' desks being loaded with these tributes. On the house side there was a very full attendance. On the floor many familiar faces were missed, though there were some notable acces sion and some return of old members. Ohio loses two valuable members iu Jordan and Follet. Maryland loses McLane, the minister to France. New York loses S. S. Cox and Dorsheimer, two able men, appointed to Federal offices, the first a remarkable off-hand debater. Kentucky loses Phil Thomp son, Jr., a very valuable representa tive, and Missouri loses Buckner and Broadhead. There is a large compensation, how ever, in getting rid of such creatures as John S. Wise, of Virginia, and J. Warren Keifer.of Ohio, and in the ac cession of Breckinridge, of Kentucky; Gay, ot Louisiana; Scott, of Pennsyl vania, and John W. Daniel, of Vir ginia. The best Republican leaders Read, Hiscock, Phelps, Lond and Kelley are still in their places, and On the Dem ocratic side one n&tices the familiar faces of Randall, Morrison, Carlisle, Willjs, Hewett, Ragan, Curtiu, Tucker, Dup.n, Herbert, Uolman and othef strong men. In point of talent and effectiveness the two opposing sides of the house are not badly . matched, the Republi cans having some advantage in the line of criticism and opposition to com pensate them for the traditions of job bing and sectionalism on which their party is based. The work ol to-day was all routine, but much was done. The house was fully organized, the members sworn in and the Beats arranged by lot as usual. All this consumed the day, but it had to be done some time or other, and no time was wasted in squabbling and details. Mr. Carlisle made a modest and kindly address which tended to in crease his present large popularity. The message will probably come along to-morrow. Its text cannot be known in advance. The precautions taken insure that much, but the lead ing ideas of the message have prob ably been well discounted by the press, uui Mr. uicveiana is a man not given to concealments. That ho will favor a moderate re duction Of duties nnri u slntrililinutinn of the tariff, a reduction or suspension of the silver coinage, an adherence to the civil service reform policy and methods, a moderate increase of the navy, and an Indian policy looking to making the Indian tribes self-supporting, the relief of the supreme court docket and other reforms, including economy in the public expenditures, is almost certain. The sketch of foreign relations will Cive a neaftpfnl ovhlhih rhnnuh Iho Keily incident will probably be lightly touched upon. The message will no scanned with deep interest. The Republicans are preparing for a vigorous onslaught on the administra tion. The course of the New York Tribune, its virulent mendacity and hate inspired by Blaine, the keen dis appointment of the vultures and birds of prey, all foreshadow a campaign of unusual rancor and falsehood, in which the bloody shirt will of course be made to figure largely. The message and reports will be watched by them very carefully in order to discern points of attack if they canjbe found. Meantime, we may expect a lopg debate in the house over the rules. Conversation with members to-day fails to develop any considerable op position to the demand for a change in the rules, which will restore to the house its loss faculty of free action on public questions. The appropriation bills may be distributed or left where they now are, but nearly all members insist that they shall be promptly re ported, that there shall be a chance to read them, at least, before passing them, an opportunity also for debate, and methods adopted by which a known majority of the house can take up and pass other public measures of Importance. The press generally praise Secretary Limar's report Even the New York Tribune, fertile in blackguardism as It is, is forced to compliment the report. Secretary Manning has rendered a long opinion on the subject of ap praisement of imported goods, holding that he cannot Interfere unless fraudu lent or illegal action by the appraisers is alleged and reasonably shown. Mr.Tilden'g letter on the subject of ordnance and defense of the seaports, whether right or wrong, is the point of very careful study Hnd research upon the subject. He has spent the sum mer and fall studvins the subject and reading ud everv document within his reach that would throw light on the subject. There is reason to believe that the Rupublicaos will make a Btrong fight against confirming First Auditor Chenowite, and bis confirmation is altogether uncertain. All the Lonsiana members were in place to-day. Blanchard and Gay se cured good seats, King, Iron and St. Martin rather poor ones. Mr. King has bills to regulate the Presidential count and the electoral succession which he proposes to offer at a convenient opportunity. 

ALMOST 1NCREDABLE. The Largest Loaded Train Ever Hauled by One Engine Major M. Burke Gives a Practical Demon stration of What an Engine Can Do. About two weeks siuce the manage ment of the Morgan's Texas railroad, placed and run into New Orleads from the limit of their road an immense train of freight cars consisting of 114 cars. This achievement gave rise to much comment and speculation in railroad circles, as it was the greatest number of loaded cars than had aver been hauled in this section; it also ani mated tne amumon of other railroad managers. Supt. M. Burke, of the L , N. 0. & T . R. R., after consulting with his master mechanic, Capt. Ed. Ander son, proclaimed bis intention of haul ing to New Orleans from Wilson, a distance of 122 miles, with one engine, a train to consist of 150 loaded freight cars. When tbis'intention of Major Burke's was made known many of the more experienced railroad men shook their heads knowingly, and said "the Major has attempted too much." Sunday was BDDointed as the a C. II, reporter was invited by Major Burke to accompany him in his special car auu witness me ieat. , xne train was made up of trains and cars from all tributary roads which had arrived mere uu ine oay previous, consisting or oj cars in tne switcn at Wil son and 88 from the sldim at Ethel and Slaughter, nine and fourteen miles below. The engine was a McQueen, of 52 tons and was a six driver ten wheel locomotive and Mr. Ilefeli was her engineer, while Mr. C. H. Merritt was conductor of the train. There were in the train 134 car loads of cotton, 10 loads of staves and S of merchandise. These cars averaged 34 feet In length, aggre gating 5,100 feet or 90 feet over a mile, allowing 30 inches to each car for slack and drawheads 375, or a grand total length of train, including 68 feet length of two cabooses and 49 feet of endue, of 5.583 feet or 578 feet over a mile. Some difficulty was experienced in get ting links and pins to stand the strain required on those in front. Thetonage of freight on the train was 1,852,831 i .rn.'i - . puuuus, ioi cars at an average ot zi, 000 pounds each, 3,648,000 with an aggregate weight of freight and cars to be hauled of 5,442,831 pounds. Mr. G. Barrow, of the freight department of this road, was sent for by Maj. Burke to take charge of the way bills of the train. Capt. E.I. Anderson, master mechHnin of the road, was on the engine with Mr. Hafeli. Superintendent Burke, while his car. drawn bv aner engine, remained several hundred feet to the rear of this train, remained him self in company with Master of Trains Marshall on the big train. The rate of speed made was about nine miles per hour, and could have been made much greater but for the breaking of coupling pins in taking up slack in running. This is beyond doubt, as It is pronounced by the New Orleans press, the longest and heaviest train ever pulled by one engine It run to "La Place" Sunday night and went into the city yesterday with a banner hanging from the rear car upon which was printed in large letters, "The Champion Load." Maj Burke is a go-ahead man and in this he has demonstrated that when he wills there is always a way and he will make it go, A Captain's Fortunate Dioovery. Capt. Coleman, schooner Weymouth, plying between Atlantic City and New York, had been troubled with a cough so that he was unable to sleep, and was induced to try Dr. King's New Dis covery for Consumption. It not only gave him Instant relief, but allayed the extreme soreness in his breast. His children were similarly affected, and a single dose had the same happy effect. Dr. King's New Discovery -is now the standard remedy In the Coleman house hold and on board the schooner.

The President's Message is very lengthy, but Is of such value that its length will not deter any patriot from reading' every word of it. No good citizen can read it and not feel proud of his citizenship. 1 It treats fully of our foreign rela tions, and as they are in an exceeding ly satisfactory condition, we may be Bure American interests have been carefully watched and guarded by the State Department. On the questions at issue between the great parties, the President frank ly and fully expresses his convictions. He handles the giant corporations, that by the aid of the Republican party have acquired so much of the publi lands, without gloves. He takes strong ground in favor of exacting of them what the people are entitled to. His reference to the available public lands in the Territories will be encouraging to the Southern people. He says that three-fifths of all the -public lands have been acquired by actual settlers and corporations, and t!-iat a large portion of the remaining two-fifths is unfit for settlement by reason of its mountainous and sterile character. In addition to this fact, a very great portion of the public land of the Northwest has such a severely cold climate, that it is not nearly so desir able as the vacant land In the South ern States. It is certain that the tide of emigration and capital will soon turn Southward. Indeed it has already started and it will steadily increase as the available supply of public land decreases. On the civil service the President is clear and positive. While many will doubt tbe practicability of bis views, none will doubt their wisdom or, sin cerity. The message is noteworthy.as indi cating one of the purest and most earnest administrations since the days of. Washington. In every depart ment honest endeavor to serve the people faithfully is manifest, and It will inspire men of all parties with confidence. The anxietv with vMoh some saw the Government change from Republican to Democratic hands. will give way to a conviction that bur rulers are trustworthy statesmen of the highest integrity and patriotism. The election of Mr. Sherman to ere- side over the senate has no political slgnlcance, as many imagine. Some think that bis course in the Ohio cam paign is thus endorsed by his party. In the discussion of the question in Washington the Ohio campaign was not even mentioned, and the blooiiy shirt had nothing to do with the mat ter. His election resulted from the desire of the Republican Senators to quiet complaints made by him and his friends at at his not being placed at the head of the Finances Committee after he retired from Hayes's Cabinet" and returned to the Senate. When he left the Senate to become Secretary of the Treasury, he was chairman of the Finance Committee. When he re turned to the Senate he complained bitterly, that he was not accord ed his ' old position, The whole matter is now arranged by his election as President pro tem. of the Senate. Logan was first elected, as his name had been most prominently mentioned, but it was understood that he was not to accept. Such is politics. The Nineteenth Century Club is an onganlzation that will consist of an equal number of men and women. It is hardly to be expected that thev will agree on all subjects ; but it can ap prise no one to learn that Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical DiscoveryMs unani mouBly pronounced the most success ful remedy extant, for pulmonary consumption, as has been demonstrated in hundreds of cases; it positively arrests this disease and restores health and strength, if administered in its early stage.
