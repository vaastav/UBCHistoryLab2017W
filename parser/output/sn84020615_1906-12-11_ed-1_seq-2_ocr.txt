Special Correspondence. .Washington, Dec. 11. Now they -an talking of a breach In the repub lican party. By "they" is meant sen' -aura and representatives in con- sreas. They are not talking It very ioudly, nor are they talking It for imhlication; ; tut there ig a good deal of serious concern in the exchange of mngreodlonal confidences. ' The president's message Is respon sible for the talk. It Is not Indulg d in by everyone, understand; but republicans and democrats alike are .among the participants. The mes Jtage is looked upon as the first com plete and comprehensive setting forth of what Is come to lie known as the "Roosevelt platform." It meets with tne approval of a good many repub licans, outspoken and enthusiastic rpprovai. It also meets with the ap yrovall of a good many democrats. There are other republicans, con spicuous and influential in the par ty's council, whb can ' no more ap prove it than they could approve free trade or the free coinage of silver. There are also a good many democrats who look upon the presi dent's proposed measures as far too radical. That gives you the situation. The republicanism of Theodore Roose velt, say those senators and repre sentatives who do not accept his preachments. Is no more the republi canism of McKJnley and Hanna than the democracy of William Randolph Hearst is the democracy of G rover Cleveland. The difference between Hearst democracy and Cleveland democracy split the democratic party -wide open all men admit that, no . matter what their creed. That Is why democrats are amazed and con founded at the spectacle of Theorode Roosevelt and Joseph O. Cannon pull . ing together for the maintenance of party organization; Cannon of course, being the king-be in the school of republican stand-patism They should be as far apart, demo crals argue, as Hearst and Clevland are apart. The pertinent question Is, how long no such a situation continue? Some believe the end is even now in sight; that while the present short session f congress may be tided over with out a breach, it Is almost sure to corns when the sixtieth congress con veaes. Others and they are the optimistic ones think there will be no serious trouble before 1908, and they are counting on the nutlonul convention of that year to put forth a platform and nominate a candidate acceptable to all kinds of republicans. U&Vmlstlc democrats, by the way, re counting on their own party do tag the same thing. That either party will be able to - do this Is doubted by a good many ten, who for years have been close students of political himory and whose judgment generally Is looked upon as good. It would create a sen ation to publlsh the names of some oT the men of the republican party who have abandoned hope of con tiaaed party supremacy. Among "1 hem are men who are recognized as candidates for the presidentall nomi nations;' others are senators, and it is Mid some are members of the presi dent s cabinet. Mo doubt this dolorous talk has familiar sound. A realignment of the parties has been discussed as a xs- juhility for several yeurs, but belief that it Is Inevitable never was so pronounced as it is today. Many en a tors and representatives came to WahhiKtun for the opening of con Kress filled with apprehension, but still hopeful that the president would omit from his message some of the radical beliefs he waB known to en lrta!n. This hope was dissipate when the message itself appeared Ifcmocratic praise of the message has not helped the republican situation The fact that Mr. Roosevelt makes no mention of the tariff, other than to advocate free trade with the I'hllip. pines, has not greatly helped. The belief is general that he liaH held the tariff iback, and that when he does speak on that subject his utterance will ln as objectionable to the stand patters as any ther of the things lie advocates. WJght early In March next In the course of a Mediterranean cruise. It Is also reported In official circles that Count Metternich. German ambassa dor to the court of St. James, will be succeeded early in 1907 by the Here ditary Prince of Hohenlohe-Ivuingen berg, who was an attache at Charles ton House Terrace In 1892. The prince's wife Is Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg, who Is a nloce of King Edward.

Capetown, Dec. 11 The Europeans n the Transvaal are in a state of great excitement over the fate of their new ordinance for the registration of Asiatics, from which royal conseut has been withheld until a delegation of Asiatics have an opportunity to present their side of the case in Lon don. The Europeans maintain that if the Transvaal be opened for free Asiatic immigration, the skilled trade and retail commerce will Inevitably be taken from the whites, and in fifty years, the population will resemble that of India or Mauritius. Europeans will cease to be anything but a small ruling class.
