PBE3IDENTS 'MESSAGE. President Cleveland's Recom mendations to Congress. Tariff Kerbrra AcIn a Leading; Feature The XVet Incident Res-lew ol the Pen sion law. Fubllc Lamia Restored Other Recommendations. Vassktgtox, Dec 5. Congress opened at 1:S? to-day for its econd session. The President's message was presented to both faomses and read. President Ctevebrd opens his nrssage to Oonrres by calling attention to tfce fact thmt frtA. the explratle ot the presert session ot Cecgress the first century of our constitutional bfctory Is ccmpWwd. The time admonishes ut to soberly Inquire whether in tfcefast we hare .wars closely kept in the course-of safety, ad whether Ire btfre before us a way plain and lear which teals to happiness 'and perpetuity. When the experiment of our Government was undertaken Sfce chart adopted for our guidance was the Constitution. Departure from the lines there hid down is failwe. It is only by a strict adfremce to the direction they indicate. and by restraint within te limitatiors they fix, that w; can furnish proof to the world of the fitness-of the Americarrpeople for telf-soT- ernment. The ecraal and exact "Justice of whis we boast as the underlyire -principle of eur Insti lutions-rtaould not be confined to the relations of oureltizens to each other. The GoTemment itself Is under bond e the American people that it the exercise of its functions and powers It wia-aeal with the body of our citizens in a manner scrupulously ionest and fair and abso luteiy'just. We view with pride and satisfac tion the bright picture of our country's growth and prosperity, whilccnly a closer scrutiny de velops a somber shading. Upon more careful Inspection we find the wealth and luxury of our cities mingled with noverty and wretchedness. A crowded and consMmtly increasing urban pop- utstion snegests the impoverishment of rural sections and discontent with agricultural pur suits. TVc discover tfcst'the fortunes realized by our tnanufacturerers ore no longer solely the re ward of sturdy industry and enlighted foresight. tmt theT result Irom the discrimi ating favor of the Government-trad are largely Built upon un- -due exaction from the masses of our people. The gulf between employers and employed is constantly widening and classes are rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich and pow erful, while tn 'lire -other are found the toiling -poor. Corporations -which should be the carefully re- strained creatures-df tne law and the servants cf the people are fast becoming the people's masters. Still 'congratulating ourselves upon the wealth -anil prosperity of our country, aed complacently reontemplaung every incident of shange inseparaKe from the conditions. "t is our uuty as patriotic citi zens to inquire at the- present stage of our pro gress how the bond ot the Government made with the peopJe ihas' been kept and performed. Instead of limiting the tribute drawn from our citizens to the necessities of its economical d tninistration, the Got ernment persists in -exacting from 'the (people millions which, unap plied and useless, lie dormant in its treasury. This flagrant injustice and this breach of felth and obligation add to extortion the danger at' tending the diversion of the currency of the lountryfroci the legitimate channels of fcusl- uess. Under the sme laws by which the results are produced the Government permits many millions more to be added to the cost of Using of our people and to.be taken from onrtcon- turners which unreasonably swell the profits of a small but powerful minority. The people must be-taiMTfor the support of the GoTern ment under the operation of tariff laws. But to the extent that the mass of our citizens are inordinately burdened beyond any sscful public purpose, and for the ibene fit of a favored few, the Government undera pretext of an exercise of its taxing pow er, eaters gratuitously into partnership with thee favorites to their advantage and to the Injury of a vast majority of our people. This is not equality before the law. The existing situation is injurious to the health ot onrtmtire body politic .It stifles in those for whose ben- efit it is, permitted, all patriotic love of country and substitutes in its place selfish greet and igrasp.ng avarice. Yben to the selfishness of the beneficiaries of unjust discrimination under our law there shall fce added the discontent of tbeaa who suffer from such discrimination, we will realize the fact that the beneficent purpose of our iGcvernment, cepenoent upon the patriotism ted contentment of our people, is eniancercd. iCcinmunisni is a hateful thing, and a menace 'to peace and organized government. But the sotnmunism of combined wealth and capital. 'tire outgrowth of overweaning cupidibv and felfishaess which insidiously undermines the justice and integrity of free institutions, is not ess dangerous than the communism f op pressed poverty and toil, which, exasperated 'by injustice ana discontent attacks with. vrtld jiisorder tbe-citadel of rule.

Such a revision should receive the-sup- ,port of all who love that justice and equality due to American citizenship; ot all who realize that in this justice and equality our Govern- TBent finds its strength and power U protect the -citizen and his property -of all who believe that the corrtent cient, competence and comfort of tnany accord better with the spirit of our Institutions than-colossal fortunes unfairly gathered is the aintiso'-a few.; of all who appreciate thaCthe forbearance and fraternity among our pecple. whiehnvcegmze the value of every Ameri-.au i interest are the surest guaranty of our national progress, and of all who dedre to see the pro ducts of American vkUl and ingenuity in every iinarkct of the world, with .suiting restoration of American commerce. .CxisUnevils and injustices should be honestly -recognized, boldly met and effectively reete- .idied.

A lev of the sumcrotu msstrations of this taaitunn may be stated: The crowded condition ot the calendar of the Supreme Court, and tne delay to setters and de nial cfjudce resulting therefrom, hare been strongly crrd upon the attention of the Con cress. wita a plan for the relief of the situation approved by those well able to judge of its sier jls. TVhi'e this subject remains without effect ive consideration, many laws have been passed fZJ!l2Z larlg-VIirgaf ttrraa oi initact , ecurto at plaeas to suit the oenrenlenee ot local ities or to lay the foundation nf an application for the erection of a new-public building. Repeated recommendations have been sub mitted for the amendment and ohange ot the laws relating to our public lands, so that their spoliation and diversion to other uses than as homes for hottest settlers might be prevented. While a measure to meet this conceded neces sity of reform remains awaiting the action of the Congress many claims to the public lands and applications for their donation in favor ot States and individuals have been allowed. A plan in aid of Indian management, recom mended by those weit informed as containing Taluabie features in furtherance of tin solution ot the Indian problem, has thus far Tailed of legislative sanction, while grants of doubtful expediency to railroad companies, permitting Uaem to pass through Indian reservaafons, have greatly multiplied. The oropriety and necessity of the erection nf one or more prisons for the confinement of United States convicts and a post-office build ing in the National capital are not disputed, but these needs yet remain unanswered, while scores ot public buildings hare been erected where their necessity for public purpose is not apparent. A revisieet of our pension laws should be made, which would rest upon just principles and provide for every worthy applicant. But while our general pension laws remain con fused aad Imperfect, hundreds cf our priiate pension laws are annually passed which are the sources ot unjust discrimination and pop ular demoralization. Apprepnation bills for the support ot the Government are defaced by items and provis ions to meet private ends and it Is freely as serted y responsible and experienced parties that a bill appropriating money for public in ternal Improvement would fail to meet with favor, unless it contained items more for local and yrivate advantage than for public benefit. These statements can be much emphasized by an ascertainment of the proportion of Federal legislation, which either bears upon its face its private character or which, upon examination, develops such a motive power. And yet the people wait and expect from their chosen representatives such patriotic action as will advance the welfare of the entire country and this expectation can only be answered by the performance of public duty with unselfish pur pose. Our mission amocg the nations ot the earth and our success in accomp'lhing the work God has given the American people to do, require of those intrusted with the making and execu tion ot our laws, perfect devotion, above all other things, to the public good. This devotion will lead us to strongly resist all impatience of constitutional limitations of Federal power and to persistently check the increasing tendency to extend the scope ot Federal legislation Into the domain of State and local jurisdiction upon the plea of subserving the public welfare. The preservation of the partitions between proper subjects of Federal and local care and regulation, is ot such importance under the Constitution, which is the law of our very ex istence that no consideration of expedience or sentiment should tempt us to enter upon doubtful ground. "We have undertaken to dis cover and proclaim the richest blessings ot a free Government with the Constitution as our guide. Let us follow the way it points out. ItwCl not mislead. And surely no one who has taken upon himself the solemn obligation to support and preserve the Constitution can find justification or solace for disloyalty in the excuse that he wandered and disobeyed in search of a better way to reach the public wel fare than the Constitution offers. What has been said Is deemed not inappro priate at a time when, from a century's height we view the way alreidy trod by the American people and attempt to discover their future paths. The seventh President of the United States the soldier and statesman and at all times the firm and brave friend of the people in vindication ol his course as the protector ot the popular rights and championship of true American citizenship, declared: '"The ambition which leads me on is-an anxious desire anfl -a fixed determination to restore to the people, unimpaired, the sacred trust they have confided to my charge, to heal the wounds of the Constitution and to prevent its violation. To persuade my countrymen, so far as I m-iy. that it is not in a splendid rovemment supported by powerful monop olies and aristocratic establishments that they will find happiness or their liberties pro tected,"but in a plain sjstem, void of pomp protecting all and granting favors to none, dis pensing its blessings like the dew of Heaven, unseen .and unfelt save in the freshness and beautr they contribute to produce. It Is such a Government the genius of our people requires such an one only under which our States may remain for ages to come united, prosperous and free." 

TOREICV AFFAIRS. TheTresident announces that the close of the year finds the United States in the enjoyment ot domestic tranquility and at peace with all the Nations. Foreign relations have been strength ened and improved by performance ot individual good offices and by new and renewed treaties of amity, commerce and reciprocity and extradi tion ot criminals. The Fisheries question has not been satisfactorily adjusted, but since March 3d, IsST, no cases have been re ported to the Department ot State wherein complaint has been made of unlawful or unfriendly treatment by Canadian authori ties in which reparation was not promptly and satisfactorily obtained by the United btates Consul-General at Sail ax. I continue in the opinion that the treaty of February last, which failed to receive the approval of the Senate, did supply "a satisfactory, practicable and final adjustment, on a basis honorable and just to both parties, to the difficult and vexed ques tion to which it related," and having subse quently and unavaillngly recommended other legislation to Congress which I hoped would suffice to meet the urgency created by the rejection -of the treity, I now again invoke the earnest and immediate attention ot the Congress to the con dition ef this 'important question as it now stands before them and the country, and for the settlement ot which! am deeply solicitous. TThe West inc.dent is treated as fol'ows: Sear the close of the month ot October last occurrences of a-deeply regrettable nature were brought to my knowledge, which made it my pilnf ul but imperative dnty to- obtain, with as little delay as possible, a new personal chan nel ot diplomatic intercourse in this country with the Government of Great Britain. The correspondence in relation to this incident will in due oourc be laid before you and will disclose the unpardonable -conduct of the offi cial referred to in his interference by advice and counsel with the suffrages of American cit- dzess in the veryxrisis cf the Presidential elec tion then near at hand and also in his subse quent action, superadding impugnment ot the .Executive and Senate of the -United States in connection with important questions now pend ing in controversy between ithe two Govern ments. The offense thus committed iiS most grave, involving disastrous possibilities to the good relations of .the United States and -Great Britain, constituting .gross breach ot diplomatic privilege and an invasion of the purely domestic affairs and essential sove reignly of the Gorernment to which the .envoy was accredited Having first fulfilled the just demands of international comity, by affording Joll-opportuniry for her ilajesty's Government to act in relief of the situation. I considered prolongation of the subject to be unwarranted aad therefore declined to further recognize the diplomatic character of the person whoe.con tinnanae in such function would destroy that which is essential to the good understanding of the two Governments, and was inconsistent with tne welfare and self-respect of the Govern ment of the United States. The usual inter change ff communication has since, continued through her Majesty's legation in this city. Tbe President calls attecSion to the eed of measures to prevent the destruction ot fur; seals in Sehnngs sea: for a survey of the. Alasfcan boundary, to prevent new complica tions with England for measures to alleviate loss of life asd property en the great lakes, especially & concession from Canada allow ing Amencs. vessels to go to the assistance of wrecks is Canadian waters, as Canadian ves sels are allowed to come into ours; the protec tion ot atzxexs of French ongia faun demands for military serrfce whes they return to France the return to German steamship lines of mer est upon tonnage Illegally exacted. The Presi dent calls attention to our relations witJi Samoa; says the fund to recompense Chine-e citizens for uspszes received in this country straits acceptance by China, and the exclusion of tnis class will probably prevent repetition of such troubles Japan still wants oar good ofVes is helping ec establish her right ta con trol ser own commerce; the establishment of consalates is Corsa is recommended: the United States is lookaig after her citizens in HayU, but is endeavoring to main tain proper neutrtaty: the treaty with Hawaii having been extended calls up the commercial Importance of a sub marine telegraph to Honolulu. X commercial treaty should be concluded with Mexico and appropriation cade for a pre cise relocation of our boundary with that coun try. The Mexican Government shows a very Inesdly spin; is its osneratios is the staia- f aeaee along theJetern tMsttat ary. The President thea-cnUs attention to our relations with Central and South American States and the claims ot certain ot our citizens against Chili, Ecuador and Venezuela. As authorized by the Congress, preliminary steps have been taken for the assemblage at this capital duriug the coming year of the rep resentatives ot South and Central American States, together with those of Mexico, Hayti and San Domingo, to discuss sundry Important monetary and commercial topics. Excepting 1c those cases where from reasons of contiguity of territory and the existence of a border line in capable ot being guarded, reciprocal commer cial treaties may be found expedient, it is believed that commercial policies Inducing freer mutual exchange of products can be most advantageously arranged by independent but co-eperative legislation. In the mode last men tioned he control of our taxation for revenue will be always retained In our hands, unre stricted by conventional agreements with other Governments. utsncRATiox. With the rapid increase of immigration to our shores and the facilities ot modern travel abuses of the generous privileees offered by our naturalizati n laws call for their careful revision. The easy and unguarded manner in which certificates ot American citizenship can now be obtained has induced a class, un fortunately large, to avail themselves of the opportunity to become absolved from alleg iance to their native land and yet by a foreign residence to escape any just duty and contribu tion of service to the country of their proposed adoption. Thus while evading the duties of citizenship to the United States they may make prompt rlaim for its national protection and demand its intervention In their behalf. International complications of a seri ous nature arise and the correspondence ot the State Department discloses the great number and complexity of the questions which have been raised. Our law regulating the issue of passports should be carefully revised and the institution of a central bureau of registration at the capital Is again strongly recommended. By this means full particulars ot each case of naturalization In the United States would be secured and properly indexed and recorded, and thus many cases ot spurious citizenship would be detected and unjust responsibilities would be avoided. The maritime powers have also been Invited to confer in Washington in April next regard ing uniform rules for the security of lite and property at sea. 

TIIE COSSETAIl SKtmOB. The reorganization of the consular service is a matter ot serious importance to our National interests. The number of existing principal consular offices is believed to be greater than is at all necessary for the conduct of the public business. I repeat the recommendations here tofore made by me that the appropriation for the maintenance of our diplomatic and consular service should be recast, that the so-called no tarial or unofficial fees which our representa tives abroad are now enabled to treat as per sonal perquisites should be forbidden: that a system of consular inspection should be insti tuted, and that a limited number ot 'secretaries of legatlon-at large should be authorized. THE WASnUTGTOS CESTESNIAL. Preparations for the centennial celebration on April 30, IS?1, ot the inauguration of George Washington as President of the United States at the city of New York have been made by a voluntary organization of the citizens ot that locality. -nd believing that an opportunity ihould be afforded for the expression of the in terest felt throughout the country tn this event, I respectfully recommend fitting and co-operative action by Congress on behalf of the people of the United States. THE 

TREASURY. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows that the total ordinary revenues of the Government for the fiscal year ended June 3D, 1S. amounted to 4.CT.33G.074 T8, of which fc!19,091,17t 63 was received from customs duties and lli4.i9G,sn to from internal taxes. The totaljrcceipts from all sources exceeded thoe for the fiscal year ended June 3), ISST, by ?7,82!,T9T.1U. The ordinary expenditures of the fiscal year ending JuneS), 1SN. were iJ59,633, SKK67, leaving a surplus of 119,G2,11S.09. The decrease in these expenditures as com pared with the fiscal year ended June 31.1S-T, was ?5,SrS,C2L31, notwithstanding the payment of more than t5,00,0"0 for pensions in excess of what was paid for that purpose in the latter mentioned year. .The revenues of the Government Tor the year ended June 30, 1&8S. ascertained for the quarter ended Sep tember M, icSS, and estimated for the re mainder of the time, amount to fiT7,(XM, and the actual and estimated ordinary expendi tures for the same years are 1271,00 .W), leaving an estimated surplus of tl(M,.O,0i. The estimated receipts for the year ending June 20. 1K, are !377,00fl.fo0, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same time are f275,7C7,4').31, showing a surplus of Sl01,-..- 51 1.60. The foregoing statements of surplus do not take into account the sum necessary to be expended to meet the requirements of the sink ing fund act, amounting to more than I 7,OJ0,0iX) annually. The cost of collecting the customs rev enues forthe last fiscal year was s.4J per cent.; for the year 18S3 it was 3.77 per cent. The excess of internal revenue taxes collected during the last flsc-il year over those collected forthe year ended June 30, 1!S7, was KMsO, 174.23. and the cost of collecting this revenue decreased from 3.4 per cent. In lSs7to less than 3.4 per cent, for the last year. Bonds of the Government not yet due have been purchased up to and including the 30th day of November, 1SSS, amounting to i9l,704,4l), the premium paid thereon amounting to 117,508.613.08. The premium, added to the principal of these bonds, represents an investment yielding about S per cent, interest for the time they still had to run, and the sav ing to the Government represented by the dif ference between the amount of interest at 2 per cent, ujton the sum paid for principal and premium and what would have paid for interest at the rate specified in the bonds if they had run to their -maturity is about CS'.lES.OiXX At first sight fhK would seexa to be a profitable and sensible transaction on the part of the Govern ment, but as suggested by the Secretary ot the Treasury the surplus tans expended for the pur hasaot bonds was money drawn from the people In exeeesot any actual need of the Gov ernment and was so expended rather than allow it to remain in the treasury. At the close of the Caeal year ended June 8, 1Ss7, there had been cvined under the compul sory Silver Coinage act rJ66.858.290 in sdver dol lars, .-O,JOt,310 of whicfc were In the hands of the people on the 30th day of June, 16S8. There had been coined 3,7047J1. and of this 8r-S.SJ9-,-303 was in circulation tn eein and ?20Q,327.376 in silver certificates, for the redemption of which silver dollars t tkat amount were held by the Goverdment. The Secretary recommends the suspension of the further coixaie ot silver, and In such recom mendation I earnestly concur. the Amor. The Secretary of War reports that the army, at the date ot the lateonsolidated returns, con sisted of 2,183 officers and 2l9 enlisted men. The actual expenditures of the War Depart ment for the fical year ended June Srt, less, amounted to &l,ii.1 17.07. of which sum ifl.'SS, 5I4.C3 was expended for public works, including nver and harbor improvements. I earnestly req-oest that the reeomipenda tions contained in the Secretary's report, all of which are. in my opinion, calculated to In crease the usefulse-s and discipline of thearmy may receive the consideration f the Congress, among these the proposal that there should be provided a plan tor the examination of officers to test their fitness for promotion is of the ut most importance. This reform has been before recommended in the reports of the Secretary, and its expediency is so fully demonstrated by the argument he presents in its favor that us adoption shonld no longer be neglected. The dtath of General Shendin in August last was a National adction. The nrmythex lost the grandest of its chiefs. The country lost a brave and experienced soldier, -t wise and discreet counselor, and a modest and sensible man. Those who in any manner came within the range of his personal association will sever fail to pay deserved and wiUzcg homage to his geatness aad the glory of his career, tat they wtu cherish tvith more tender sensibtlsy the loving memory ot his simple, generous and considerate nature. THE If AVT. The report cf the Secretary f the Xavy demonstrates very intelligent masasemest is that important department and discloses t&e most satisfactory progress in the work of re constructing the navy made during- the past year. Of the ships in coupie of construction, five, viz.i The Charleston, die Baltimore, the Tork. the Vesuvius and the Petrel have in that time bees launched and are rapidly approach ing completion. The Philadelphia, the San Francisco, the Newark, the Bennington, the Concord and the HerreshcS torpedo boats are aQ under contract for delivery to the depart ment during the next yea. The progress already made and beisg mad gives good ground for the expect""3 that these eleven vessels win Us incorporated a3 pert of the Americas navy within the next twelve months. Tbe report sioTj thai, sotwjthstandisg tas 1 large expeadltnea tor sew euusUacMua, m4 the additional labor they involve, the total ordinary or current expenditures ot the de partment for the three years ended Jane 30, liS?, are les3 by more than 30 per cent, than such expenditures forthe three years ended June 30, 1SS4. The various steps which have been taken to improve the business methods of the Depattment are reviewed bv the Secre tary. The purchasing of supplies has been con solidated and placed under a responsible bu reau head. This has resulted in the curtail ment ot open purchases, which in the years 1984 and 1885 amounted to over so per cent, of all tne purchases of the department, to less than 11 per cent.; so that at the present time about j per cent, of the total departmental purchases are Biade by contract and after competition. As the exDenditures on this account exceed on an average of C000,000 annually, it is evident that an important improvement en the system has been Inaugurated and substantial economies introduced. toe Fosr-orrrcx. The report of the Postmaster-General shows a marked Increase of business in every branch of the postal service. The numberot post-offices on July 1, 1SSS, was 57,376, an Increase of 6,124 In three years and of 1S10 for tne last fiscal year. Free delivery offices have increased from 169 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1887, to 35? In the Year ended June 30, 1SS. In the railway mail service there has been increase in one year of 168 routes, and in the number of miles traveled per annum an increase of 150,795,917.48. The estimated increase of railroad service for the year was 0,060 miles, but the amount of new railroad service actually put on was 12.764.50 miles. The volume of business in the money order division including transactions in postal notes. reached the sum of upwards of 143 millions for the year. During the past year parcel post con ventions have been concluded with Barbadoes. the Bahamas, British Honduras and Mexico and are now under negotiation with all the Central and South American State. The in crease for correspondence with foreign countries during the past three years is gratify ing and Is especially notable and exceptional with the Central and South American States and Mexico. As the greater part ot mall matter exchanged with these countries is com mercial in its character this Increase is evi dence of the increased business relations with them. The practical operation of the parcel post convention so far as negotiated has served to fulfil the most favorable prediction as to their benefits. In January last a general postal con vention was negotiated with the Dominion of Canada, which went into operation March 1 and which practically makes one postal territory of the United States and Canada. Under It mer chandise parcels may now be transmitted through the malls at fourth class rates ot post age. It is not possible here to touch even the lead ing heads of the great postal establishment to illustrate the enormous and rapid growth of the business and the needs for legislative readjust ment ot much ot Its machinery that it has out grown. For these and valuable rcccommenda- tlons of the Postmaster General attention is invited to hL report. A department whose revenues have Increased from tl9,772,0iO In 1870 to t52.7-0.000 In lbSS, despite reduction ot post age which have enormously reduced rates of revenue while dally Increasing its business de mands the careful consideration of the Congress as to all matters suggested by those familiar with Its operations and which are calculated to Increase Its efficiency and usefulness. Of the total number of postmasters 54,874 are of the fourth class. Thes, of course, receive no allowances whatever for expenses In the ser vice, and their compensation is fixed by per centages on receipU at their respective offices, This rate ot compensation may hae been and probably was. at one time, just, but the stand ard has remained unchanged through the sev eral reductions in the rates ot postage. Such reductions have necessarily cutvdown the com pensation of these officials while It undoubtedly increased the business performed by them. Simple justice requires a mention ot this sub ject to the end that fourth-class postmasters may receive at least an equivalent to that which the law itself fixing the rate intended for them. Another class of postal employes whose con dlt on seems to demand legislation is that of clerks in post-ofllces. and I call especial atten tion to the repeated recommendations of the Postmaster-General for their classification. Proper legislation of this character for the relief of carriers in the free delivery service has been frequent. Provision is made for their promotion, for substitutes for them on vaca tion; for substitutes for holidays, and limiting their hours of labor. Seven million dollars has been appropriated for the current year to pro vide for them, though the total number of of fices where they are employed Is but 3M for the past fiscal year, 1th an estimated increase for the current ear ot but forty, while the total appropriation for all clerks In offices through out the United States Is rs,9Gfl,0i. 

DEPARTMENT OF JCSTICE. The transactions ot the Department of Jus tice forthe fiscal ear ended June 3), lisSS. are contained in the report of the Attorney Gen eral, as well as a number of valuable recom mendations, the most of which are repetitions of those previously made and ought to receive consideration. It is stated in this report that though judgments in civil suits amounting to tJSS.02l.tS were recovered in favor of the Gov ernment during the year, only the sum of (132, ftil was collected thereon; and that though fines, penalties and forfeitures were Imposed amounting to KX, KM 41. only Jt 9,648.42 of that sum was paid on account thereof. These tacts may furnish an illustration ot the sentiment which extensively prevails that a debt due the Government should cause no in coveniencc to the citizen. It also appears from this report that tbaugh prior to March, INS. there had been but six convictions in the Territories of Utah and Idaho under the laws ot 18G2 and ISSi, punish ing polygamy and unlawful cohabitation as crimes, there have been since that date nearly six hundred convictions nnder the laws and statutes of lstfr. and the opinion is expressed that undersuch a firm and vigilant execution of these laws and the advance ot ideas opposed to the forbidden practices, polygamy within the united States Is virtually at an end. Suits instituted by the Government under the previsions of the act ot March 3, 1&87, for the termination of the corporations known as the perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and the Church of Jesus Christ ot Latter Day Saints have resulted, in a degree, favorable to the Government, declaring the charters of these corporations forfeited and escheating their property. Such property, amounting in value to more than 1800,00 is in the hands ot a re ceiver, pending further proceedings, an appeal having been taken to the Supreme Court of the United States. PUBLIC LAND XATTECS. In the report of the Secretary of the Interior. which will be laid before you, the condition of the various branches of our domestic affairs connected with that Department and its opera tions daring the past year are fully exhibited. But a brief reference to some of the subjects discussed in this able and Interesting report enn be here made, but I recommend the entire report to the attention of Congress and trust that the sensible and valuable recommenda tions it contains will secure careful considera tion. I -can not too strenuously insist on the Im portance of proper measures to insure a right disposition ol our public lands, not only as a matter of present justice but m forecast of the consequences to future generations. The broad, nch acres of our agricultural plains have been long preserved by nature to become her untrammelled gift to a people civilized and free upon which should rest, in well distributed ownership, the numerous homes of enlightened, equal and fraternal citizens. We came to Na tional possession with the warning example in our eyes ot the entail of inequities of landed proprietorship which other countries have per mitted and still suffer. We have co excuse for the violation of prin ciples, cogently taught by reason and example, nor for the allowance of pretexts which have sometimes exposed our land to colossal greed. iiws wnioi open a door to fraudulent acquisi tion or an administration which permits the capacious searcre by a favored few of the ex panded areas that many should enjoy are ac cessory to offenses against our National welfare acd humanity and can not be too severely con demned or pumshed. Iz is gratifying so know that something has been done at last to redress the injuries to our peoale and cheek the perilous tendency of the reckless waste of national domain. That over eightr million acres have been wrested from illegal usurpation, improvident grants and fraudulent entries and claims must afford a profouxd gratification to right feeling citizens as it is a recompense for the labors and struggles of the recovery. Our dear experience ought sufficiently to urge the speedy enactment of measures ot lega tion which wfll confine the future "position of oar remaining agnenltp-- mnds to the uses ofactoal hk-arr ad genuine homes. Nor .wuia our vast tracks of so-ealled desert land be yielded up to the monopoly of corporations or grasping individuals as appears to be much the tendency under the existing statutes. The lards require but the supply of water to become let tile aad productive. It U a yrpblea of great assent haw mote wUely (Br the public goe that factor shall be furnished. leas not but think it perilous to suffer either those lands or the sources of their Irrigation to fall Into the hands of monopolies which, by such means, may exercise lordship over areas dependent ot? their treatment for productiveness. Already steps have been takes to secure ac curate and scientific information of the condi tion which is the principal basis of Intell'gent act-on. Until this shall be gathered, the course of wisdom appears clearly to be In a suspension of further disposal, which only promises to create rights antagonistic to the common in terest. No harm can follow this cautionary conduct. The land will remain, and the public good presents no demand tor hasty disposses sion ot National ownership and control. I commend also the recommendations that appropriate measures be taken to complete the adjustment ot the various grants made to the States for Internal Improvements and of swamp and overflowed lands as well as to adjudicate and finally determine the validity and extent of the numerous private land claims. All these are elements of great injustice and peril to the settlers upon the localities affected, and now that their existence can not be avoided no duty is more pressing than to fix as soon as possible their bounds and terminate the threats ol trouble which arise from uncertainty. THE WDtMfS. The condition of our Indian population con tlnues to Improve and the proofs multiply that the transforming change so much to be desired, which shall substitute for barbarism enlighten, ment and civilizing education, is in favorable progress. Allotments In severalty hate been made on some reservations, until all those en titled to land thereon have had their shares assigned, and the work is still continued. As soon as possible community In laad shonld cease, by opening up such as remain unallotted to settlement. Contact with the ways ot industrious and successful farmers will perhaps add a healthy emulation which will both instruct and stimulate. But no agency for the amelioration ot this people appears to be so promising as tbe ex tension urged by the Secretary of such com plete facilities of education as shall at the the earliest possible day embrace all teach able Indian youths ot both sexes and retain them with a kindly and beneficent bold untd their characters are formed and their faculties trained The Apache Indians at Mount Vernon bar racks. Ala., are being well cared for and their children carefully educated, and there Is no good reason why they should be returned to the reservation. They should be kept la restraint. 

FENSIOKS. The number ot pensions added to tbe roll during the fiscal year ended June 30, ISSf, is 60,252, and lnciease ot pension was granted in 45,716 cases. The names of 15,730 pensioners were dropped from the rolls during the year for various causes, and at the close of the year the number of pensioners was 452.537. Of these there were SX survivors of the war of 1S1-J, 10,787 widows of those who served in that war; 16.OS0 soldiers of the Mexican war and 5,101 widows ot said soldiers. One hundred and two different rates of pen sions are paid to these beneficiaries, ranging from R to (416.66 per month. The amount paid for pensions during the fiscal year was 178,773,851.91, being an Increase over tiie pre ceding year of t308,2S0.22. The expeamr at tending the maintenance and operational the Pension Bureau during that period was 13,362. 534.67, making the entire expenditures of the bureau 182.038,35.17. being 21H percent, of the gross income and nearly 31 per cent, of the to tal expenditures of the Government during the year. I am thoroughly convinced that our general pension laws should be revised and adjusted to meet, as far as possible In the light of our ex. perience. all meritorious cases. The fact that one hundred and two different rates ot pensions are paid can not in my opinion be made con slstent with justice to the pensioners or to the Government, aad the numerous private pen sion bills tint are passed, predicated upon the Imperfection of general laws, while they in crease in many cases existing Inequality and injustice, lend additional force to the recommendation for a revision of tbe general laws on this subject. The laxity ot Ideas prevailing among a large number of our people regarding pensions is be coming every day more marked. The principles upon n hich they should be granted are tn dan ger of being altogether ignored, and already pensions are often claimed because the appli cants are as much entitled as other successful applicants, rather than upon any dlsabil lty reasonably attributable to military service. If the establishment oi various precedents be continued. It the granting of pensions be not divorced from partisan and other unworthy and irrelevant con sidcrations, and the honorable name of veteran unfairly becomes by these means but another term for one who constantly clamors for the ail of the Government there Is danger that lnj iry will be done to the fame and patrotism of many whom our citizens delight to honor, and that a prejudice will be aroused unjust to meritori ous applicants for pensions, ACniCCUCRE. The Department of Agriculture has continued with a good measure of success in its efforts tc develop the processes, enlarge the result and augment the profits of American husbandry. It has collected and distributed practical information. Introduced and tested new plants, checked the spread of contagious diseases of farm animals, resisted the advance of noxious insects and destructive fungus growths and sought to secure to agricultural labor the highest reward of effort and the full est Immunity from loss. Its records of the year show that the season of IsSj has been one ot medium production. A generous supply ot the demands ot consumption has been assured and a surplus for exportation, moderate In certain products and bountiful in others, will prove a benefaction alike to buyer and grower. Four years ago it was found that the great cattle Industry of the country was endangered and those engaged in it were alarmed at the rapid extention ot the European lung plague of pleuro-pneumonla. Serious outbreaks existed In Illinois, Missouri aad Kentucky, and in Tennessee animals affected were held in quarantine. Five counties in New York and from one to four counties each in the States ot New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Delaware and Maryland were almost equally affected. With tbe great danger upon us and with the con tagion already tn the channels of commerce; with the enormous direct and Indirect losses already being caused by it, and when only prompt and energetic action could be success ful, there were in none of these States any laws authorizing this department to eradicate the malady or giving the State officials power to co operate for this purpose. Tbe deport ment even lacked both the requisite ap propriation and authority. By securing State co-operation In connection with authority from Congress, the work of eradica tion has been pressed successfully and this dreaded disease has been extirpated from the Western States, with the exception of a few re stricted areas which are still under supervision. The danger has thus been removed and trade and commerce have been freed from the vexatious State restr ctlons which w ere deemed necessary for a time. An exhaustive study has also within the same period been undertaken of the subject of food adulteration and the best analytical method for determining it. A part of the results ot this work has already bees published oy the department, which, with the matter in course ot preparation, will make the most complete treatise on that subject that eier has been puolished is any country. The de partment seeks a progressive development. It would combine the discoveries of science with the economies and amelioration of rural prac tice. A supervision of the endowed experi mental station system recently provided for, is a proper function of the depart ment and is new in operation. During the past four years the process of dif fusion as applied to the manufacture of sugat from sorghum and sugar cane has been intro duccd into this country and fully perfected by the experiments carried on by the department. This process is now universally considered te be themost economical one, and it is througt it that the sorghum sugar industry has beet established upon a fins basis and the road U its future success opened. The adoption et till diffusion process is also extending in Louislan. and other sugar producing parts of the countrj and will probobly be the on'y method employed for the extraction of sugar from the cane. The Government's relations with land grant roads are taken up and the District ot Columbia affairs treated at length.
