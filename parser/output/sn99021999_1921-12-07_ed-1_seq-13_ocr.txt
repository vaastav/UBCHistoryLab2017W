THE. BEE: OMAHA. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7. 1921. 13 Plans Made for Anollior Mprurpr Of Steel Plants Six or More Concern in New York and Ohio to He Drought Into One Great Cor poration. . By HOLLAND. In one of the addresses which wee recently niado hy Charles M. Schwab, he spoke in favor of industrial corn bination directed by a single, very able leader, which would permit reasonable competition with other organizations engaged in similar manufacture and would also estab lish healthful co-operation. Mr. Schwab is thought to have had in mind when he thus spoke- the con templated merger of several inde pendent steel corporations. For it is presumed that he must have known last summer that a plan of this kind was then under consideration. Others , had knowledge of it but their in formation was confidentially impart ed so that they could do no more than hint at it. n of the loading business and finan cial authorities said In the autumn, having; first Impoited confidence, that ,a merger was under consideration Involv ing several of the large independent In dustries ami 1f It were completed would be ot atmoHt Inestimable benefit to Amor- nan business mid Industrial Ufa. But. hp aald, this la nut iho only mentor that la In contemplation for when IhK iima la propitious an oarnest effort will ne maue to merge into one large corpo ration several of tho railway systems of he United States. This la apart from .ie recommendation that the country be evlded Into zones In each of which tho allways were to ba consolidated Into a. jingle system. Steel Merger Planned. Thla man said mora recently that It la now possible to aay that the merger to wnicn ne rererreo. early in tne law would nnng at least six, poasilily seven or eight. Independent steel corporations In to alnifle orxanlied body. It must be therefore that all who have had the plun tinder consideration have now pro gressed ao far In their atudy of It that aubatantlal and authoritative admission has been made that a number of the Independent ateel companies have been considering a plan by means of which they can reach' a satisfactory basis for consolidation. Various surmises have been made as to the identity of tha independent steel companies which If the plan be adopted will be merged into a single great cor poration. Almost all of these Indepen dent steel companies have their chief Plants m western New York and in eastern Ohio. They are In the vicinity of Pittsburgh Which will probably al . ways remain the center of the chief steel Industry of the United States al though the time is not distant when the Industry .at Birmingham, Ala., mny rank a close second. There la tho Mid Vale Steel and Ordnance company, the Republic Iron and Hteel company, the Lackawanna Steel company, the Youngs town Hheet and Tube company, the Brier Hill Steel company whose plant Is near Youcgstown. the Inland Steel company and the Steel 'and Tube Company of America, Co-Operatlon and Competition. It Is tho surmise that Judge Gary, who is chairman of the board of the United States Steel corporation, does not regard with disfavor or apprehension a merger of thia kind. He has often said for publication and oftener in private con- . versauon inai lor economic reasons anu for the best Interest of the industries of the United States It would be well if large "Independent Industries be brought, as the United States Steel corporation was brourht. Into a single corporation. Of course It la recognized that a merger of this kind will make It all the easier to maintain reasonable competition with the United States Steel corporation. But reasoname competition is vjeiqome. u tests the ability- and the capacity to bring forth produots of . high quality at relatively low cost. " It does not mean that harmful antagonisms will be cre atod, for upon matters , of general In terest and pollcJe&.of national tmpor-. tance it hi possible, to maintain com- "Hon. That is the policy wmcn nas made tha Clearing House association in New York of great and honorable In fluence, . although., the individual mem bers of the Clearing House are engaged today in more Vigorous competition for business! than at any previous time. The United States Steel corporation has demonstrated that pot least among the policies which enable the corpora tion to produce steel and jron products ' at comparatively "low cost is the fact that this corporation embodies a con siderable number in the steel and Iron Industry which were formerly operated Independently. That undoubtedly is one of the considerations which has stimu- latea mose wno t-uimui dent steel and Iron industries to take careful an yet couragsous steps with the view of bringing all of these : Indepen dent Industries into one family. Iarge ret 1 omparaiiveiy ouiau. These Independent companies can pro duce nearly -,800,000 tons of ateel a vear. They are also as a whole the own ers of rich and extensive ore, coke and coal properties and limestone. They have every facility In the way of raw material for operating their plants. If the merger is based upon the aggregate capital it will represent S467.000.000. If It were not for tho United States Steel corpora tion, that figure would Justify listing the merged company 'as the leader so far as capital Is concerned In American industries. Vet It is, comparatively speaking, small when tha capital of the United Steel corporation is cc-nsidered. In fact, the capital' stock of the Steel corporation, a little over $500,000,000, is represented by common stock. Tho underlying feature, however, of this contemplated merger is the fact that It represents the belief of- all the lead ers In the American steel and iron in dustry that Mr. Schwab was conserva tive wheh he ventured to predict a few davs -ago that the future of the steel Industry in thr United States, provided there ' be reasonable combination and co-operation, is to be enormously pros perous. This merger will make it pos .ihi i avian to a considerable ex tent In the export trade of which the United States Steel corporation now pos sesses the greater share. The plan may be abandoned for rea- ,; J - nn, BltnHr. Kilt 'e Impression In the financial district W that it is now well on the road to 'consummation and that the financing of it will be handled easily with great skill and without involving any watering of securities. - Hay Market, Furnished by Omaha Hay Exchange, December 1. 1921: w Prairie Hay Receipts have been light during past week; - demand fair; top prices slightly lower.

Severa hundred cattle were carried over from Monday - and local packers were apparently no more anxietis for- lib--eral supplies today than they were then.' Bids and sales were generally around 25c lower except on a few desirable handy weight steers and heifera. Eastern ship pers bought a' few desirable beef steers and cows at about steady prices, but It was a 25c lower deal on practically every thing that went - to local packers. Busi ness In stockers and feeders was rather quiet, but prices generally held steady; .

Weakness in De cember wheat at Minneapolis, where prices were off 4 l-2c at one time, more than offset bullish news from Europe and Argentina, and precipi tr.ted liquidation at Chicago, with the close at net losses of 1 ?-82 7-8c, with July leading. Coarse grains weakened with wheat and ' finished with corn S-8 1 l-4c and oats 1-8 5-8c lower, while rye was off 3c. There was sufficient .bullish news in the wheat market, under normal conditions , of trading, to have brought about a sharp upturn in prices, but at the top early they showed only l-2lc over the finish of the previous day. Foreign cables told of an improved demand for cash wheat. The seaboard claimed a good export business, with 500,000 bushels Manitobas sold abroad. Antwerp ' reported a more general demand and there 'were inquiries re ceived at Chicago for offers from the United Kingdom, the first in some time. Argentine exporters were reported in London cables as rcbuying wheat sold to the United Kingdom, on .ac count of .crop deterioration. Broom hall, after careful investigation, esti mated the surplus from the old crop remaining for shipment at 24,000,000 bushels or half of what was recently said to be on hand, suggesting a total surplus of 143,000,000 bushels, old and new grain. Kansas also sent dry, weather reports. Corn Market Heavy. Prospects of an Immense export busi ness In 'corn, with domestic and export sales f 750,000 bushels in all positions in the west during the day, counted tor little in the corn market and the undertone was heavy': from the start. Cash houses bought December to remove hedges against shipping sales, but better weather condi tfona led to heavy sales to arrive by tho country and sample values, while un changed early, were lc lower at the last. President Harding, in his message to con gress, asked for an appropriation to buy 10,000,000. bUBhels corn for Russian relief, buit it was ignored as a market influence, as was tile strength in stocks and foreign exchange,- especially marks. The seaboard reported '400,000 to 600,000 bushels corn sold for export. Receipts were 467 cars. Oats Were affected by the action of other grains and ranged lower, closing at the bottom. Domestic shipping demand was better, but the total business was not given. Premiums on epot were unchanged as compared with the December. Re ceipts, 96 cars. . . Houses with seaboard connections were free buyers of rye early, but the market flattened out later when wheat broke and closed about the bottom. The Beaboard reported 1,000,000 bushels sold for export in the-past;two days. Receipts, five cars. Pit Notes. .' Minneapolis wired Leland: "December wheat has become weak here, going to almost 3 cents discount under May. Many traders expected to see December continue Btrong, as the September did, but there appears lo be no concentrated holding in the current month." ' An Antwerp cable said that there had been a complete recovery from the recent . apathy there. Consumptive demand for' all grains was reported active." According to New Tork, Germany has established a good line of credit, but where they got it la said to be a mystery. Germany recently has bought Australian wheat, American, rye and corn, nnd Mon day was a factor in the rye market. Total sales of rye were 1,000,000 bushels yesterday and today, 750.000 bushels being worked yesterday. Milwaukee stocks of rye are said to have been about all cleaned up. Hutchinson, Kan., wired Bennett: "A local banker, who la a very 'conservative man, states that in this territory the 1922 wheat promise has been cut down 70 per-cent. Snow was sufficient to bene fit the crop only In a few places." Updike Grain company had an Austral ian cable 'saing that wheat was in fair condition, but was in the critical period and that reliable authorities placed the crop prospect at about 80 per cent of normal. The fact that 600.000 bushels No. 2 yellow corn at Buffalo .was sold for ex port at 2 cent's over May c. 1. f. Buffalo, caused considerable comment. The demand was regarded as more urgent than sup posed. Domestic sales were more liberal than for some time and shippers here In many cases are confident that asy nor mal run of corn will be taken care of without difficulty. In spite of the enormous' receipts of wheat at Canadian terminals for weeks past, much larger, In fact, than for the same time a year ago, visible stocks now are only about 9.000,000 bushels more than a year ago, and there was a decrease of 3,836,000 bushels for the week.

New York. Dec. 6. In view of existing circumstances, especially the proposal to defer cash payments on Germany's reparations account after next February, today's move ment of foreign exchange was in teresting. That the German mark should have risen, on the report that such purpose was. officially con sidered, to the highest price since Berlin's "black Thursday," Decem ber 1, was natural. The day's re covery from .0043 3-4 to .0050 1-2 will doubtless have its own impli cations to the German stock ex changes; but that is another matter. The sharp rise in sterling to $4.08 7-8, a higher rate than has yet been touched since the autumn, of 1919, might be taken as London's expression of satisfaction over the drift of the reparations controversy, for Lombard street had rather evi dently come . to , favor leniency to Germany. French Francs l"p. But today's rise In French exchange to 7.61 4c an advance of nearly 1-3 cent since tne increase oegan, is consiueraoiy more significant because it is a very plain comment of the outside financial world on the lately prevalent Idea that suspen sion of cash payments by Germany -nuuld drive France into bankruptcy. The price reached by' the franc on today's market was the highest since the first days of September and something like 25 per cent above the rate of a year ago this week. What we thus far have in the cables regarding the proposed three-year remis sion seems to be more or less tentative in character; indeed, It does not appear that either the allies or Germany have agreed on the conditions to be attached to it, No Change in 8tocks. No change occurred today In tho char acter of the stock market. It was again made un of a seemingly purposeless mix ture of advances and declines. Wall street went through the form or discussing tne influence on the market, of the president's speech to congress or of the seeming settlement of the Irish question. ' Such matters as these often have considerable effect on a day's market, but not on a market which has given no reflection to the arms conference, and which makes no response even to the discovery that tne railways, as a wnoie, nave nearly ur quite earned the objective 6 per cent In October. In the bond market there was no change. Most of the Liberty bonds fell back a small fraction and the Victory is remained at their subscription price. The time is now fairly near when we shall learn whether the November bond mar ket embodied the "reinvestment demand" coming ahead of time or was only a fore runner of .the actual year end. reinvestment.
