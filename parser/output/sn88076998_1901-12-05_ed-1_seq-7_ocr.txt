i*£ The following is a comprehensive sum mary of President Roosevelt's message to congress: Sends His First Ao&ual'Message torthe Senate and House \& HAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ON IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. Eulogizes the Late President.McKinley and Advocates^ Stern Measures for:Anarchists—Proposes Trust LegislationAlongthe Lines of Pub lfcity—Favors Government Construction of Iringatidn "Works- The president begins his first annual communication with an official announce ment of the death of the late President McKinley, and a eulogy of his former chief in which he says: "It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley's death he was the most widely-loved man in all the United States, while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter ani mosities incident to public life. His po litical opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, thfe sweetness and eentleness of character which so endeared him to his close asso ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender affec tions and home virtues which «re all important in the makeup of national character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the union, he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relations. There could be no personal hatred of him, for he never act ed with aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or private life. The defenders of those mur derous criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is exer cised for political ends inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power. But for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged." "The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter In the minds of all who saw the dark days while the president yet hovered between life and death. At last the light was stilled In the kindly eyes, and the breath went from the lins that even in mortal agony uttered no words save of forgiveness to his murderer, of 'love for his friends and of unfaltering trust in the will of the Most High. Such a death crowning the glory of such a life leaves us with Infinite sorrow, but with such' pride in what he had accomplished and in ills own personal character that we feel the blow not as struck at him, but as struck at the nation. We mourn a good and great president who is dead, but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements of his life and the grand heroism with which he met his death." In the same connection he makes strong recommendations as to how the nation should deal with anarchy. He urges that the preaching or teaching of anarchy be not permitted, and requests congress to enact legislation that will prevent anarchists from foreign countries landing upon our shores. He would also have the federal courts given jurisdiction over any man who kills, or attempts to kill, the president of the country, gr any person who is in line for succession to the presidency. He has no fear, however, that the country will ever,fail into an archy. "The federal courts should be given jur isdiction over any man who kills or at tempts to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law Is in line of succession forx the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our in stitutions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race, and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of nations, like piracy and that form of man stealing known as -the slave trade, for it Is of far blacker Infamy than either. It should be so declared by treaties among all civilized powers. Such treaties would give to the federal government the power of dealing with the crime."

Another reason for caution in trust legis latids?which he 'gives "is to be' found in the international! conunereial condttions of to day .^The same business conditions which haveSroduceji- -great-aggregations of corporate $nd .individual -wealth have madf): them very potent 'factors' in Inter national commercial competition.

There are excep tions, and in times of prosperity somewill prosper far more and in times of adversi ty some will suffer far more than others but, speaking generally, a period of good times means that all share more or less in them, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater or less degree." He points to the fact that in the past "the ignorant or reckless agitator has been the really effective friend of the evils which he has been nominally oppos ing. In dealing with business interests for the government to undertake by crude and ill-considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad would be to incur the risk of such far-reaching na tional disaster that it would be prefer able to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would endeavor to IInd out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in what manner it is prac ticable to apply remedies." Remedies for the Trust Evil. But while he says the above is true, he yet sees many evils for which there should be remedies provided. Of these evils the chief is over capitalization, "bccause o:' its many baleful consequences."' He .says: "The conviction of the American people that the great corporations, k.iown as Massachusetts in order to produce excellent remits." The president believes th&t 'it will be ^possible to secure the needed "remedies fqt the.-'trust evil under thij ertnftitution as" it now exists, but if congress thinks votherwise he recommends iltirt. a «in titu tthnai amendment be subm tted tnat will co,fer the povev necessary.: connetuin'i with .'the- trusts hs rec ingunends legislation creating^cabinetfiofi Vfiefcr. to h! krown ss seciftary of^-Jftft tr»ice, whose di tiesi:. woui'J be with all qu vtion* eipicernVr coiHtRebfiaf' lit rr and -th* infchjMtt Wonld -Exclnie the nt'ndation for i!

The standard of ilvlgg Is "alsfo higher than ever before. Every -efrort of legis lator and admibistratof :8n0ivrd'be be^t needs to have i.s trusts, are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare, is based upon sincere conviction that com bination and concentration should be not prohibited, but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled, and in my judgment this conviction is right." As a remedy for these evils he says: "The first essential In determining how to deal with the great industrial com binations is knowledge of the facts publicity. In the interest of the public the government should have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in inter state business. Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be determined after publicity has been obtained by process of law and in the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and complete —knowledge which may be made public to the world. "Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations de pending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and full and accurate information as to their operations should be made public regu larly at reasonable intervals." "The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one state, always do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated. There is utter lack of uniformity in the state laws about them, and as no state has any exclusive interest in or power over their acts it has in practice proved im possible to get adequate regulation through state action. Therefore in the interest, of the whole people the nation should, without interfering with the- pow er of the states in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regula tion over all corporations doing an inter state business. This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in Its business. There would be no hardship in such supervision. Banks are subject to it, and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed it Is probable that supervision of corpora tions^toy the not go so far as Is now the case with the supervision exercised over them bv so oohservative'.sj/state to secure the permanency oi^lhL1* condition of things and its imprdvement wherfcyer possible..

In the labor unions of the present he sees much that is good, in which connection he says: "Very great good has b«en and wilifce accomplished by associations or unions of wageworkers--»,when, managed 'with forethought and Whe'fi'they combine in sistence upon their owp rights with law abiding -respect for the rights of others. The "display of these qualities In such -bodies is-a-duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves. -'•'at .Finally there must als.o in many cases be action by the -government in order to safeguard the rights and interests of all. .Under, our constitution there is' much more scope for such action by the state and the-municipality-than by the nation.: But on points such, as those touched on above the -national government can act.

In which connection he pays "we need.every honest and. of ficiant 1 Immigrant fitted to' become an' American clUsen, every Immigrant who comes here, to stay, who brings hire1 a strong bodjt, a irodd head and a resolute purpose to dc his duty well in every way ana to brine up nls children as law-abiding. God-fearing members of the community.". But he says: "There should be a comprehensive law cnacted with the object of workln* a threefold improvement over our present system. First, we should aim to .exclude absolutely not only all persons who'are wn to be believers in anarfcHistlc prln or members of anarchistic socie but also all persons who are of a moral tendency or of unsavbry repu tation.

The president does not desire any change in the present tariff schedule except where such may be made in reciprocity treaties and recommends the adoption of reciproc ity treaties and the general policy of reci procity as a means of opening the doors of foreign nations to our commerce, in which connection he says: "Every application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must nev6r be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wageworker is a prime consid eration of our entire policy of economio legislation. "Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home the principle of reci procity must command our hearty sup port. The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a lib eral policy in dealing with foreign na tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex atious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long run directly or indirectly pur chase those surplus products by giving us something in return. Their ability to pur chase our products should as far as pos sible be secured by so arranging our tar iff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. "The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with those of our productions which no longer require all of the support once needed- to establish them- upon a sound basis, and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition.' "I ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor." Tlic Merchant Marine. The president pronounces our merchant marine "discreditable to us as a nation and ins.ignifiQant to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of business," and says we "should not longer submit to conditions under which only a trifling por tion of our great commerce is carried in our own ships. Of this he sayB: "To remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build up our shipping in terests, but it would P.lso result In benefit to all who are interested In .the perma nent establishment ot wider market for American products nnd would: provide &n auxiliary force for the ravi'i iShips work for their own ccur-tries just as, railroads work for their terminal ^points. Shipping lin^s, if established to the principal coun tries with which we have: dealings, would be of political as wei! as commercial ben efit. From every standpoint.it is unwise for the United State to continue'to rely upon the ships of competing nations,for the distribution of. on: goods. It should be made advantageousi.to carry American goods in American built ships.". His recommendation -On. this subject is ly that "our government should take action as will remedy these inequall •j The American merchant marine uld be restored to the ocean." f! Fv?t that each at times stumbles or halts, thai each at Finances. 'il: L'Adar this heading the president recom lis such legislation as will better safe |al'd against the deranging Influences of irtmerclal crtecs. and financial panics and .eh as will make the currency of the [untry moro responsive to the demands domestic trace and commerce. .. ,. le points out the iact that the receipts bm duties on imports and internal taxes fefced the exptnd'turcs of the govern pnt. but counsels ^Kftinst^redhcing the fr'jr.ues so that 'thsftVilfcUli^'the possi fijy of a deficit. iut after providing:-:sigatest" any such tinger.cy .wans should be' adopted Mfh will bring the rever.ues more nearly thin the limit of our actual needs." le urges the necessity for strict economy expenditures, but that- "'our national |ej Js forbid us to be niggardly in the mat jof providing whatever Is actually nec ^ary to our well-being." Inter-State Commerce, points to defects' In the interstate merce law, and recommends amend ts to correct them, in which connection life Says: S'Those who complain of the management jtho railways allege that established t^s are not maintained, that re tes and similar devices are habitually •orted to, that -these preferences -are liiu'ally in favor of the large shipper, that tjley drive out of business the smaller competitor, that while many rates are too low many others are ^excessive and that grops preferences are made affecting both localities and commodities. Upon the oth er hand, the railways assert that the law by its very terms tends to produce many 'of these illegal practices by depriving car riers of that right of concerted action which they claim i? .necessary to estabr lish and maintain nondiscriminating rates. "The act should be amended. The rail way'-is a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to It that within its jurisdiction this is so. and should provide a speedy, inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. At the same time It must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the develop ment and operation of these commercial agencies." Agricultural Interests. -The president clte's the forest legislation the past and the great-good Of forest- :preserves to the people, and says they will inevitably be of still greater value. Con tinuing. he says: "At present the protection of the forest -reserves rests with the general land office, the mapping and description of their tim ber with the United States geological sur •vev and the preparation of plans for their "conssrvative use with the bureau of for estry. which is also charged with the gen eral advancement of practical forestry in th»-United States. These various func tions should be united in the bureau of forestry, to which they properly- belorg. ..The present diffusion of responsibility'is :£ad from-every-standpoint. It prevents that effective cooperation between the government and the men who utilize the resources of the reserves, without which the Interests of both must suffer.

The in creased demand for manufactured arti cles will stimulate Industrial production, while wider home markets ana the trade of Asia will consume the larger food sup plies and effectually prevent western competition with eastern agriculture. In deed, the products of irrigation will be consumed chiefly in upbuilding local cen ters of mining and other industries which would otherwise not come into existence at all. Our people as a whole will profit, for successful homemaklng is but another name for the upbuilding of the nation." He counsels against attempting too much at the beginning, but advises, that we let experience on a small plan teach the pos sibilities of greater undertakings.

With a few creditable exceptions, the arid states have failed to provide for the certain and just division of etreanu in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain .laws have made it possible to establlslv'fights to water In excess of actual uses or "ne cessities, and many streams have already passed into private ownership or a control equivalent to ownership. "Whoever controls a stream practically controls the land It renders productive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition of such ownership, which has been per mitted to grow up in the arid regions, snould give way to a more enlightened and larger recognition of the rights of the pub lic in the control and disposal of the pub lic water supplies. Laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humid1 regions, where water Is too abundant to justify hoarding it, have no proper application in a dry country* "In the arid states the only right to water which should be recognized is that of use.

It is therefore necessary that the congress should pass laws by which the resources of the islands can be developed, so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can be granted to companies doih*»uslness in them and every encburagerafeit be given to the incoming of business men of every kind.

Four thousand additional sea men and a thousand additional marines should be provided, and an increase in the officers should be provided by making a large addition to the classes at Annap olis: There Is one small matter which should be mentioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmean ing title of 'naval cadet' should be abol ished: the^tltle of 'midshipman,' full of historic association, should be restored. "We now have 17 battleships appropri ated for, of which nine are -completed and lfavfe been cbmmlissloned for actual service.

The organization and armament of the national guard of the several states, which are treated as militia in the ap propriations by the congress, should be made Identical with those provided for the regular forces. The obligations and duties of the guard In time of war should be carefully defined and a system estab lished by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in advance. It is ut terly impossible in the excitement and haste of Impending war to do this satis factorily If the arrangements have not been made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing In- the first volunteer organizations called out the training of those citizens who have al ready had experience under arms, and especially for the selection in advance of the officers of any force which may ba raised: for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible after the outbreak of war."

In short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing save the man's own character and capacity and the needs of the service. "The administration of these islands should be ,as wholly free from the .sus picion of partisan politics as the admin istration of the army and navy. All that we ask from the public servant In the Philippines or Porto Rico is that he re flect honor on his country by the way in which he -makes that country's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come un der it.

Among other recommendations which the president/makes are those asking for leg islation that Will Improve the consular serv ice alongjlnes outlined In bills introduced at previous ,sessions, and he says that: It is true that the service is now in the main efficient but a standard of excellence cannot be permanently maintained until the principles set forth In the bills here tofore submitted to the congress on this subject are enacted Into law." He believes the time has arrived when the Indian: should cease to be treated as a member of tribe, but as an Individual, i.aihd recommends breaking up the tribal Tfunds, putting a stop to the Indiscriminate -permission-to Indians to lease their allot ments and stopping the ration system.

He calls'i'ttention to the growth of the postal system and to the fact that the an nual deficit in this department of the gov ernment service has been reduced to the small sum of *3,923,727. This, he says, could further be Increased and possibly a surplus shown but for the fact that many publi cations are now securing the pound rate as second-class mail.matter which are nofe entitled to the same, under the law. Of this he says?: \j- .t "The full measure of postal' pros which might be realized has* long hampered and, obstructed by the burden liA|4se$ on the ^Vernmeiit' through th$ intrenched and well stood abuses which have grown I nectlon with second-class mall matter. The extent of this burden appeaTs when it is stated that, while the second-class mat ter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the mail, It paid for the last fiscal year only $4,294,445 of the aggregate postal revenue of $111,631,198. If the pound rate of postage, which produces the- large loss ..thus.entailed and which was fixedjby the congress with" the purpose of encouraging the dissemination of public injfoirnatlon, were" limited torthe' legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually upntemplated by the law, no. just exception ohuld be taken. That expense would be the recogr^zejl and accepted, cost of a llberal.publle policy de liberately adopted for a justifiable end. But much of tho matter which enjoys the Jirlvlleged rate Is wholly outside of the ntent of the law. and has .secured admis sion only through an evasion of its re quirements or through lax construction. The proportion of such wrongly included matter is estimated, by postal experts to be one-half of thtf whole volume of second class' mail. If It be '-orfly one-third or one quarter, the magnitude of the burden is apparent. The post office department has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as possible by a stricter application of the law, and it should be sustained ia Its effort." Tlie Chinese DHBcnItlesv He calls attention to the satisfactory settlement of the Chinese difficulties of laifet year, and this nation's part In the settlement, and says provisions have been made for insuring the future safety« of- 'the foreign represen a^tive,s. Of tlWs promises made by China he says: "The Chinese government has agreed to participate financially in the work of bet tering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tientsin, the centers of foreign trade in central and northern China, and an international conservancy board, in which the Chinese government is largely represented, has been provided for the Improvement of the Shanghai river and the control of Its navigation. In the same line of commercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports has been assented to for the purpose ot substitut­ ing specific for ad valorem duties, and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of the United States to assist in this work. A list of articles to remain free of duty, including flour, cereals and rice, gold and silver coin and bullion, has also been agreed upon in the settlement." f--. ln^ condttJtioiv h*-.-inei»tions «*b* Pan-w Americanrcongresef -nowln •scaaiotj'-gt the^aj gyrap«*wgi"the by the people of both these nations upon the assassination of President McKinley. 3
