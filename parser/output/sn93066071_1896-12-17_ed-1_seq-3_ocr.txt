Washington, Dec. 7. The Fifty Fourth congress assembled for the short (tcsstou at uoon to-day and soon after committees from the house nnd seriate waited on the president and in formed him that they were ready to receive any communication he mi 'lit havo to make and the president theu sent the following communication: To tbo Convresi of tho United btntes: As representatives of the people in the IcrIs Intlve branch of their Rovcrnrac nt you ia o as sembled nt n time when the Htrenuth nnd ex cellence of our frco lmtltutlnns and the fitness of our eltlfii ti enjuv popular rule have been tutain mailv inaulfet. A political contest In volving nmiuciitous con-ioiiuonccs, fraught with fovcrlsli apprehension nnd creating dr (rcsshcnesi so Intense nsto approach bitter ness nnd passion, has been wnged throughout our land and determined by tho decree of free and Independent suffrage, ulthout disturbance of our tranquility or thn least sign of weakness In our national structure. When we consldor theso Incidents and contemplate tho peaceful obcdlcnco nnd manly submission which have succeeded n heated clash of political opinions wo discover abundant evidence of n determi nation on tho part of our countrymen to abide by overy verdict of the popular will and to bo controlled nt nit times by un abiding faith In the agencies established for tho direction of tho nffalrs of thelrcnvernmcnt. Thus our peo ple exhibit u patriotic olsposlUon which en titles them to demand of those wio undertake to maho and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as run only bo promptel by it serious appreciation of the trust nnd confidence which the acceptanco of public duty Invites. In obedience to n con stitutional requirement, I herein -submit to the concrcss certain information coneerninij na tional nffalrs, with tl sugitostlon of such leg islation as in tny judgment Is necessary nnd expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tlre somo narration, I shall nmlt many details con cerning matters within federal control which, though by no means unimportant, nre more protllably discussed In departmental roports. I shall also curtail this communication by omitting minute recital of many minor Inci dents connected with our foreign relations which hae hitherto found n pi ico In executive messages, but nro now contained In n report of tho secretary -of state, which Is 'herewith sub mitted. TIia Armenian Question. At the outset of a reference to imoro Impor tant matters nff( ctfnjr our relitlons with foreign powers It -would afford mo satisfaction If I could assure Oio concrcss that tho disturbed condition of Asiatic Turkey had during the past year assumed a less hideous and bloody aspect and that either us a consequenco-of tho uwatening 'Of tho Turltlsh government to tho demmds of human civilization, or as tho re sult of decish o action on tho part of tho great nations having tho right by treaty to Ititor'oro tor tho protection of those exposed to tbo rngo of mere bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the shocking features of tho situation had been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a softening disposition or protective interven tion, we havo bcon uflllctod by continued and not unf rcquent reports of tho wanton destruc tion al homes nnd tho bloody butchery of men, women and children, made martyr to tholr profession of Christian faith. While none of our citizens In Turkey have thus fa' been killed or wounded, though often In Uio midst of dreadful scenes of dangor. tholr safety In the future Is by no means assured. Our gov ernment at homo and our minister at Constan tinople have left nothing undone to protect our missionaries InOttomin torrltory, whoconstl tutenearly all tbs individuals residing there who have n right to claim our protection on tho scoro of American citizenship Several naval vessels aro stationed In the Med iterranean as a measure of caution and to fur nish all possible, relief and refuge In case of emergency. Wo have made claims agaipst the Turkish government for tho pillage nnd de struction of mlsslonnrv property at, Ilarpool and-Mnrasli during uprisings at those plncos. The IiiNjirrectloii In Cuba. Thoiinsurrectlon In Cuba still continues with nil Its pcrploxltlos. It Is difficult to perceive that nnv progress has thus far been mado to wards tho pacification of tho island or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last an nual message has In the loast Improved. If Spain still holds Havana and tho seaports nnd all considerable towns, tho Insurgents still roam nt will over at loist two-thirds of tho In land country. If tho determination or Spain to put down tho Insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lupso of tlmo and is evidenced by her unhesitating dootlon of largely Increased mllltiry and naval forces to tho task, thero is much rea son to believe that the Insurgents bao gained in point of numbers, nnd character, and rcHources, and aro uona tho less Inflexible In their resolve not to succumb, without practi cally securing tho great projoct for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet ro-cstab-lishcd her authority, neither havo the Insur gents yet made good their title to bo regarded as an independent State. Indeed, as the con test has gone on, tho pretenso that civil gov ernment exists on tho island, oxcept so far as Spain Is ubli to maintain It, has been practi cally abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such n government, more or less Imperfectly, In tho large towns and their Immediate suburbs. Hut. that exception being mado. the entire country lis either given ovor to an archy or is subjoct to the mili tary occupation of ono or the other party It Is rcportod, Indeed, on rellablo nu tuorlty that, at the demand of tho commnndor-in-chief of tho Insurgent army, the putatlvo Cuban got ernment kas now given up all at tempt to exercise Its functions, leaving that government confessolly (what there Is the best reason for supposing It always to havo been in lact) u goiurnmcnt merely on paper. Were the Spanish armlos ublo to meet their antagonists In the open, or in pitched battle, prompt and declslvo results might bo looked for and tbo Immense superiority of the Spanish forces In numbers, discipline and equipment, could hardly fall to tell greatly to 'tholr advantage. Hut they nre called upon to taco a foe that. shuns general engagements, that can choose and does choose Us own ground, that from the nature of the country Js visible or.lnvlslblo nt pleasure and that fights only from ambusotde nnd when all the advantages of position and numbers nre on its side. In a country where all that Is Indispensable to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter Is so easily obtain able especially by those born and bred on the soil It Is obvious that thero Is hardly in limit to the tlmo during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as In all cases of protracted civil strife, the pas sions of the combatants grow moro nnd more inflamed and excesses on bath sides becomo moro frequent and more deplorable They also aro participated in by bands of marauders, who now In the name al ono party nnd now in the name of the other lis may best suit the occasion, harry the country at will and plunder Its wretched. Inhabitants lor their owu advantage. Such a condition of things would Inevitably entajl Immense destruction of property even ft It were, the policy of both parties to prevent it as far as practicable. Hut while such seemed to bo the original policy of the Sp inlsh env eminent, it has now apparent ly abandoned it. and is acting upon tne same theory us the insurgents, namoly, that tho ex igencies of the contest require the wholcsalo annlhllat'on of property, that it may not prove of uso and advantage to tbo enemy. It Is to (he same end that In pursuance of eeii cral order Spanish garrisons aro nov being withdrawn from plantations and the rural pop ulation rfqulred to concentrate itself In the towns. Tho sure result would seem to be that the Industrial value of the Island Is fast di minishing and unless (here Is a speedy and radical change In existing conditions, It will soon disappear altogether. That value con slstvery jargely. of course, n its capacity to produce sugars, a capacity already much re duced by the Interruption to tillage, which have taken place during the last two years. It Is reliably asserted that should these in terruptions continue during the currant year, and practically extend, as it Is now threat ened, to the entire sugar producing territory of the island, so much time and so much "money will be required to restore the land to Its normal productiveness that It is extremly doubtful It capital can be Induced to even make the attempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the globe would engage the serious attention of tho gov ernment and people of the United States under any circumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with it which Is by do means of a whollr sentimental or philanthropic character. U lies o near to us as to be hardly sepirated from oaf territory. Our actual pecuniary Intcrost In It Is sccoud only to that of the people and government of Spain. It Is reasonably estimated that at least from V,ooo, to t O.u 0,00) of American cap ital ore Invested In plantations nnd In railroad, mining nnd other business enterprises on the Island. Tho volume of trade between tho United States nnd Cuba, which In IMU amount ed to about tOI.OuO.nuu. rose in I'M to about 1103,0 o.'KW, and In 1831, the roar beforo tho In surrection broko out, nmountcd to nearly ?8. 001,0 0. llcstdcs this large pecuniary stake In the fortunes of Cuba, tho United States finds Itself Inextricably involved 111 the prosent con test In other wars both vexatious nnd costly. Many Cubans reside In this country nnd directly promoto the Insurrection through the press by public meetings, by the purchaso nnd shipment of arms, by tho raising of funds nnd by other means which the spirit of our Institutions and tho tenor of our laws do not rcrmlt to bo made the subject of criminal prosecution. Some of them, Ihouah Cubans nt hoirt nnd In all their feelings In Interests, hae tnlion out pipers as naturallzod citizens of tho United States, n proceeding resorted to with n view to possible protection by this got ernment nnd not unnatu rally regarded with much indignation by tho I country of their origin. incse inevnaoio entanglements of tho United States with tho rebellion In Cuba, tho large American property Interests affected and considerations of philanthropy and hu manity In general havo led to a chuncnt de mand In various quarters for some sort of pos ltlvo Intervention on tho part of the United States. It was at first proposed that belliger ent rights should bo accorded to tho Insur gents a proposition no longer urged becnuso untimely nnd In practical operation clearly perilous nnd lnjutlons to our own Interests. It has slnco been nnd Is now sometimes contended that tho Independence of tho Insurgents should bo recognlzod. Hut Imperfect nnd reslrlctol ns tho Spanish government of tho Island may bo. no other exists there, unless tho will of tho military officer In tcmnovnry command of a particular district can bo dlgnlllcd as a upcclos of government. It Is now suggested that tho Untied States should buy tho Island, n suggestion possibly worthy of consideration If 'there wero any evidence of n desire or willingness on tho part of Spain to en tertain such a proposal. It Is urged, finally, that nil other methods falling, the existing In ternecine strlfo In Cuba should bo terminated by our Intervention, even at tho cost of war between tho United States and Spain, a war which Its nduicalos confidently prophecy could bo nellhurlarco In Its proportions nor doubtful In Its Issue The correctness of this forecast need bo either affirmed nor denied Tho United States has nevertheless the character to main tain us a nation, which plainly dictates that right and might should bo tho rule of Its con duct. It would seem that If Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, n measuro of home rule which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain would satisfy nil rational requirements of her Spanish subjects, thero should be no Just reason why the pacification of tho Island might not be effected on that basis. It was in timated by this government to the government of Spain somo months ago thn It n satisfac tory measuro of homo rule wero tendered tho Cuban Insurgents and would bo ac cepted by them upon a guaranty of Its execution the United States would en deavor to find a way not objectlon nble to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. It should bo added that It cannot be reasonably assumed that tho hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will bo Indefinitely main tained. Whllo we aro anxious to accord all due respect to tho sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view tho pending conflict In all Its features, and properly apprehend our Itievlt-i-blo rotations to It nnd its possible results with out considering thnt by tho course of events we may be drawn Into such an unusual and unprecedented condition ns will fix a limit to our patlont waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and in her own way. or with our friendly co-operation. When tho inability of Spain to doal success fully with tho Insurrection has become mani fest, and it is demonstrated that her sover eignty Is extinct In Cuba for all purposes of Its rightful existence, nnd when a hopeless strug gle for its re-establlsbment has degenerated into a strlfo which means nothing moro than tho useless sacrifice of human life and then utter destruction of the very subject matter of tho conflict, n situation will be presented In vhlch our obligations to tin sovereignty of Spain will bo superseded by higher obligations which wo can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. The Venezuelan Ilounilury Qnentlou. Tho Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to bo a matter of dlffemu-o botween Great Britain and the United States, their re spective governments having ngreed upon tho substantial provisions of a treaty between Oreat Britain and Venezuela submitting tho whole controversy to arbitration. The provi sions of the treaty arc so eminently just nnd fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may contldontly be anticipated. Go eminent Kmenuea nnd ICxpennefi.

The War Department, The report of the secretary of war exhibits satisfactory conditions in tho several branches of the publlo service Intrusted to his charge. The limit of our artillery force as fixed by law is constantly and readily maintained. The present discipline and morals of the army are excellent and marked progress and efficiency are apparent throughout Its entire organiza tion. With the exception of delicate duties in the suppression of slight Indian disturbances along our southwestern boundary in which the Mexican troops co-operated and the compul sory, but peaceful return with the consent of Great Britain of n band of Cree Indians from Montana to the British possessions, no active operation hare been required of tho army dur ing the past year.

Tbo attorney-general presents a detailed and Interesting statement of tho Important work done under bis supervision during tho last fiscal year. Tho ownership and management by the government of penitentiaries for tho confinement of tho contlctcd lu tbo United States courts of violations of federal laws, which for many years has bocn n subjoct of cxecuttvo recommendation, has at last to a slight extent been rcnllzod by the utiliza tion of tho abandoned military prison at Fort Leavenworth ns a United Stotos penitentiary. This Is certainly a movoment In tho right di rection: but It ought to b2 nt onco supple mented by tho rebuilding or oxtenslvo enlarge ment of this Improvised prison and the con struction of nt least ono more, to bo located In tho southern states. The capacity of tho Leavenworth ponltontlnry Is so limited 'hat thooxpensaot Its maintenance, calculated nt a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners It can accommodate does not mnko ns econom ical an exhibit ns It would If It wero larger und better ndnpted to prUon purposes, but I cm thoroughly con vinced that economy, humanity and a proper senso of responsibility nnd duty toward thoso whom wo punish for violation of federal law dictate that the federal government havo tho entire control nnd management of tho pcnlten tlarlos where convicted violators are confined. Itapicars that since tho transfer of tho Fort Leavenworth mtdtary prison to Its new uses ihe work previously dono by the prisoners con fined there, and for which expensive machin ery has been provided, h is been discontinued. This work consisted of tho manufacture of articles for army uso. now dono' elsewhere. On all grounds It Is exceedingly desirable that the convicts confined in this penitentiary b9 al lowed to resume work of this description. the I'nat Office Department. Our post offlco dcpirtment is In good condi tion and tho exhibit made of its operations during the fiscal jear ended Juae 30, 1896, It allowance is made for imperfections In tbo laws applicable to it, is very satisfactory. Tho total receipts during tho year were !8J.499,S08. 40. Tho total expenditures were i9l.6;0,!9a&4, ex clusive of tl,-M),8ll&27l which was'enrned by the Pacific railroad for transportation and credit on their debt to the government. Thero was an increase of receipts over tho previous year of t5,iltV8V21, or7.l por cent, and an Increase of expenditures of $1,811,1 Jl Of, or 4 41 per cont The deficit was 1.679.910.I9 loss than that of tho prooedlng year. The chief expenditures of tbo postal service nro regulated by law and nre not In control of tho postmaster-general. All thnt ho can accomplish by tho most watch ful administration and economy Is to enforce prompt and thorough collection nnd account ing for publlo moneys and such minor savings In small expenditures nnd In lotting thoso con tracts for post ofll,co supplies und star service which nre not rcgulntod by statute. Tbo average revenue from each pound ol first-class matter was '03 cents. From each pound of second-class, RV4 mills (of the second class 5.1,348. Of was county free matter). From each pound of third-class, 13.1 cents. From each pound of fourth-class. 1V6 cents. Tho growth In weight of second-class matter has been fiom 299,0 iO.OK) pounds In 1891 toSli.OOtf, IXW In '189V, nnd to almost 319,0X),WW In 1896, nnd It is quite ovhlcnt this in creasing 'drawback Is far outstripping any possible growth of postal revenues. Our mnll sorvtco should, of course, bo such as to meet tho wants and oven the conven. IcnccRofdho people, nt a direct charge upon thorn so light as porhaps to exclude tho Idea of our post offico department being a money making concern, but in tho faco of constantly reourrlng deficiencies in 1 Us re venue. and In view of the fact that wo supply tho best mall serv ice In tho world, It seems to mo It is quite time to correct tho abuses thnt swell enor mously our annual doficlt. If we concedo the publlo policy of carrying weekly newspapers freo In the county of publication nnd 'ovon tho polloy of currying at less than one-tetnh of their cost other 'bona flda nowspapcrs and periodicals, there can'be no excuso for subjecting tho serv ice to the further immense and Increasing loss involved In carrying at the nominal rata of one cent a pound tle serial libraries, so.netlmes Including trashy and even harmful literature and other matter, which under the loose Inter pretation of a loose statute has been gradually given second-class rates, thus absorbing all profltublo returns derived from first-class matter, which pays threo or four times more thun Its cost and producing a largo annual loss to bo paid by general taxation. Kxpcrlcnco and observation havo demon strated that certain improvements in tho or ganization of tho post offico department must bo servoJibeforo wo can gain tho full benefit ol tho Immenso sums expended in its administra tion. This Involvos tho following reforms, which Loarnostly recommend: Thero should bo n small nddltlon to tho existing Inspector service, to bo cmplovcd In tbo supervision ol tho carrier force, which now numbers I3.f0 men nnd performs Its service practically without the survolllnnco exercised ovor nil other branches of tho postal or publlo service. There should also be appointed a few inspect ors who would assist the central office In nec essary Investigation concerning matters oi post office leases, post offico sites, allowance for rent, fuel and lights, and In organizing and securing tho best results from the work of the H.lOl'Clerks now employed In first and second class offices. Tho Navy Department The work of the navy department and Its present conditions aro fully exhibited in the roport of tho secretary. Tho construction of vessels for our navy has been energetically prosecuted by tbo present administration upas the general lines previously adopted, tho de partment having seen no necessity for radical changes In prior methods under which the work was found to be progressing in a manner highly satisfactory. It has boon decided, however, to provide in every ship building con tract that the builder should pav all trial ex penses, and it has also been determined tc pay no speed premiums in future contracts. On March 4, 1893, there wore in commission but two armored vessels, tbe doublo-turreted monitors Mlantonomoh and Monterey, Since that date, of vessels theretofore nuthorlzed, thero have been placed In tbolr first commis sion three first-class and two second-class bat tleships, two armored cruisers, one harbor de fense ram and five double-turreted monitors, Including Maine and Puritan, Just completed. Eight new unarmored cruisers and two new gunboats have also been commissioned. Tbc Iowa, another battleship, will be completed about March I, and at least four moro gunboati will be ready for sea In the early spring. Tho war college has developed Into an Insti tution which It is belloved will be of groat valuo to tho navy in teaching the science ol war. as well as In stimulating professional zeal In tbe navy, and it will be especially use ful in tbe devising of plans for tho utilisation In caso of necessity, of all the naval resources of the United States. The naval militia, which was authorized s few years ago, as au experiment, has now de veloped Into a body of enterprising young men actlvo and cnergctlo In the discharge ol their duties and promising great usefulness. Tola establishment has nearly the same relation to our navy as the national guard In tho din ;r ent states bears to our army, und constitutes g source of supply to our naval forcos, the Im portance o- which Ls immediately apparent. Tim Interior Department. The report of the secretary of the Interloi presents a comprehensive and interouing ex hibit of the numerous and important affairs committed to his supervision It is Impossible In this communication to do more than briefly refer to a fow of tbo subjects concerning which the secretary gives full and Instructive Infor ruatlon. Our public lands, originally amount lng to 1.810.000,000 acres havo beon so reduced that only about 600,K,t,QOJ acres still remain in government control, excluding Alaska. The balance, being by far the most valuable por tion, has beta given away to Buttlers, to new state j und to railroads, or sold at a compara tively nominal sum. The tout Indian population of the United States is 177,23, according to a census made In 1893, exclusive of those within tbo state of Ken York and those comprising the flvo civilized tribes. Of this number there are approxi mately 18.000 children of school ago. During the year 13,393 of these were enrolled In schools. Tne progress which has attended re' cent efforts to extend Indian school facilities and the anticipation ol continued liberal ap propriations to that end, rannot fall to afford tbe utmost satlsfa Hon to those who believe that tho education of In dian children Is a prlmo factor In tho accomplishment of Indian civilization. The condition of nffalM nmong tho live civilized tribes, who occupy largo trtctsot land In tho Indian territory nnd who havo governments of their own, has assumed NUh tin aspect ns ti render It almost Indlsprnsible that th.'re should bo nn entire cbango In tho rcl itlons of these Indians to the general government This seems to bo necessary In furtherance of their own Interests ns well ns tor tho protection ot non-Indian residents In tholr torrltory, A commission organized nnd empowered under several recent laws Is now negotiating with these Indians for tho relinquishment ot their courts nnd tho division of their common lands In severalty. Tho Pension lloll. Tho diminution of our enormous renslon foil and tho decrease of pension expenditures which have been so often forotold still fall In material realization. Tho numbor of pension ers on tho rolls at tho closo of tho fiscal year ended Juno 3), IcO), was 070,678. This is tho largest number ever roportod. Tho nmonnt paid exclusively for ponslons during the year wasIS8,2H,76l.9t, n slight decroe from thnt ot tho pro 'odlng yoar, while the total expend itures on nccount ot pensions, including the cost ot m ilntnlncnco of tho department nnd expenses attending pension distribution amounted to J1U.206, M)(9. or within a very small fraction of ono-thlrd of tho cntlro ex pense of sup-wrtlng tho government during tho samo year. Tho numbor of now pension certifi cates Issued was. 00 010. Of these 40,374 repre sent original allowances of olnlms nnd 1V878 tnerenscs of existing pensions. Tho number of persons rccolvlng pensions from tho United Stales, but residing In foreign countries nt tho closo of tho last fiscal yo.tr was 3,781, and the amount paid to them during the year was .3J "JVS3. Tho sum appropriated for tho pay ment of pensions for tho current fiscal year, ending Juno 34, I S'J 7. is tllO,00.0)i. and for tho succeeding year ll ls estimated that the samo smount will bo necessvry. Tho I'm-llto Itnllninds. Tho secretary calls attention to tho public Interests Involved In an adjustment ot tho ob llg itlons nt the Pacific railroads to tho govern ment. I deem It to bo an important duty to es pecially present this subject to tbo consider ation ot the congress. Oa January II, 1897. with the amount nlready matured, moro than li:t.OT(i,000 of tho principal of tho subsidiary bond Issued by tho United States In aid ot tho construction of tbo Union Pacific railway, In cluding its Kansas line, and more than 

(O.UOO, KM of like bonds, Issued In aid of the Central Pacific railroad, Including those Issued to the Western Paclflo Hallway Co., will have fallen sloo nnd been paid or must on that slax- be paid by tho government. With out any reference to tho application of tho sinking funds now In the treasury this -will creuto such a default on the part of tbo companies to tho government ns will give It tho right to nt onco institute proceedings to foreclose Its mortzago Hen. In nddltlon to this Indebtedness which will bo duo January I, lfc97. thero will mature between that date and January 1. 1899, the remaining principal of such subsidy bonds which must also bo mot by tho government. These amount to moro than ii,OO0,O0J on account of tho Union Paclflo lines nnd exceeds 21,0J,iKUon account of tho 'Control Pacific lines, Th Agricultural I)eprtment. The department ot agriculture Is so Intl- mntcly related to tho welfare of our people nnd tho prpcrlty ot our nation that It shoul 1 con- 'Ktantly tccclvo tho caro and encouragement ot tho government. Tho secretary reports thnt tho valuo ot our exports ot farm products dur ing tho last fiscal year amounted to 8 70 0.10.000, an Increase of tl7,o00,ojo ovor thoso ot tho year Immediately preceding This statement ls not tho less welcome be cnuso ot the fact that notwithstanding sach tn creaso, tho proportion of exported agricultural products to our total oxports of all description fell off during the vcar, Tho bonoflts ot an In crease In agricultural products being assured, the decrease in its proportion to our total ex ports Is moro gratifying whoa wo consider th it it is coming to tbo fact that such total exports for tho year increased moro than i7J,t00,l.08 Tho largo and Increasing exportation ot our agricultural products suggests tho great use fulness of the organization lately established In Ilia department for tbe purposo of getting to thoso engaged in tho farming pursuits re liable Information concerning the condition, needs nnd advantages of different foreign markets. Inasmuch as the success ot the farmer depends upon tho advantageous Gale ot his products, and inasmuch as foreign mar kets must largely be the destination or such product), It Is quite apparent that a knowledgo of tho conditions und wants thnt uffect these markets ought to result in sowing moro Intelligently and reap ing with a better promise of profit. Such Information points out the way to a pru dent foresight In thn selection and cultiva tion of crops und to a release from the bond ago ot unreasoning monotomy of protection, a gluttod nnd depressed mirket and constantly recurring unprofitable toll. In my opinion tho gratuitous distribution of seeds by tbo depart ment as at present conducted ought to bo discontinued. Civil fsorvlee Itefnruu Tho progress made In civil servioo reform furnishes a cause for the utmost congratula tion. It bus survived the doubts of its friends ns well as the rancor ot Its cnomles, and has gained n permanent place nmong the agencies desllnod to cleanse our politics nnd improve, economize and elevate tho public sorvlce. There aro now in the competitive classified service upwards of 81.001 places. More than half of these havo been Included from time to tlmo slnco March 4,1891. A most radical and sweeping extension was made by executive order dated tho th day of Muv, 196. and If fourth-class postm istershtps are not in cluded in tho statement It may be said that practically nit positions contemplated by tho civil service lav. arenowrlasslficd. Abundant reasons exist for Including these postmaster ships, based upon economy Improved scrvlco and tbo pence und quiet of neighborhoods. If. however obstacles prevent such action at prosent, I carnostly hopo that congress will, without Increasing post offico appropriations, so adjust them as to permit lu proper rases ot a consolld itlon of these post offices to tbo end that through this process ihe result desired may to a limited extent be accomplished. The Tariff. I desire to recur to the statements else where made concerning the government re ceipts nnd expenditures for tbe purpose of venturing upon somo suggestions touching our present tariff law and its operations. This statute took effect on tbo .'8th day of August, 1891 Whatever may bo Its shortcomings as a comptete measure ot tariff reform, it must be conceded that it has opened up the way to a freer and greater ex change of commodities between us and other couetrles and thus furnished u wider market for our products and manufactures. Ths only entire fiscal year during which this law has been In force ended on the 30th day ot June, 1896. In that year our Imports Increased over those of tbo previous your moro than (tf).5';0,0J0 while tho valuo of tho domestic prod ucts exported and which found mar kets abroad was nearly 70,0 0,x3 more than during the preceding year. Those who Insist that tho cost to our people of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful uso should only be lnereased through tarif changes to un extent nccossary to meet tho expenses of tho government, as well as thoso who claim that tariff changes may bo laid upon such articles beyond the necessities of government revenue, and wltn the additional purpose ot so increasing tbelr price in our markets as to give American manufacturers and projucors better and more profitable opportunities, must agree that our tariff laws are only primarily justified as sources of revenue to enable the government to nioet the necessary oxpnso ot Its malntenuncn. Con sidered ns to Its sufficiency In this aspect tbe present law can by no means fall under Just condemnation During the only complete fis cal year of lu operation it has ylcldol nearly ISM) ood more revenue than was received from tariff duties la the preceding year. Thero was nevertheless a deficit between our receipts and expenditures of a little more than t;WW, oou. This, however was not unexpected. Tbe situation was such In December last. seven months before tho close of tho fiscal year, that the sectetary of tho treasury fore told a deficiency of i 17.000,000. Tbe great and increasing apprehension and timidity In busi ness circles und the depression In all activities Intervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well understood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or operation, seriously checked tbe Imports we would have otherwise received and readily account for the difference between this estimate of the secre tary and the actual deflclenoy as well as for a continued deficit, I believe pur present tariff law, if allowed fair opportunity, will In tbe near future yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical expenditures, will overcome fill difficulties. In the meantime no deficit that has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet such deficit we have in the treasury. In addition to a gold reserve ot I103.uoj,o00, a urplus of more than 128,ooO,Ojo applicable to payment of expenses of the government, and Homo Down with Infirmities, which must, unless expended for that purposo, I Aro finds IU surest sol.ico In tho bcnljmnnt rneantiy tonic aid nffordeil by Hostcttei's Stomach remain a useless hoard, or, If not extra wasted, must In anv event be perverted from the purposo of Its exaction from our people, tho payment, therefore, ot nny deficiency In tho revenuo from this fund Is nothing moro than Its proper nnd legitimate use. It Is Immeasur ably better to npproptlato our surplus to tho payment ot Justifiable expenses than to allow It to become nn Invitation to reckless appro priations and extra vagnnt expenditures. I suppose It will not bo denied thnt under tho present law our peoplo obtain tbo necessaries of n comfortable existence nt a cheaper rato ban formerly. This Is n matter of supreme Import ince slnco It ls tho palpable duty of every Just government to mnko tho burdens of taxation as light ns possible. Tho people should not hi required to relinquish this privilege of chenpet living except undor tho stress of tholr government's necessity mads plainly manifest. Our rinsnclnl Mn'liols. This reference to tho condition and pros pects of our revenues naturally suggests nn nlluslon to the weakness nnd vices of our finan cial methods, Thev hnvo been frequently pressed upon tho attention of congress In pre vious cxccutlvo communications and the In evitable danger of tholr continued toleration pointed out. Without now rop-ntlng thcic de tails I cannot r.trntn from ueatn earnestly presenting tho necessity ot the prompt reform of a system opposed to every rulo of sound Ilnnnco nnd shown by exporlrncn to bo fraught with tho pravest peril and perplexity. Tho terrlblo civil war which shook tho lounintlons of our government more than 31 years ago brought in Its train tho destruction of property, tho wasting of country's substances, and thn ostrnngemom of brethcrn. T'hcso nro now past nnd forgotten. I'.ren tho distressing loss of Ilfo the conflict otitallod Is bat a sacred memory, which fostnrs patriotic sentiment and keeps nllvo a tendor regard for thoso who nobly died, and jot tliTO remains with us to day, In full strength nnd activity as un Inci dent of thnt tremendous struggle, a fenture ot Its financial necessity not only unsullcd to our present circumstances, but manifestly n dls- "'tuiuK ii inutu iu uusimi'sh security nnu nn ever present agent of monetary distress Hecnu-o wo mav bo enjoying n tempornrv re lief from Its depressing lnfiucnco this should not lull us Into a false, security nor lead us to (orgel the suddenness of past visitation. I nm moro convinced than ever that wo rannot havo assured financial peace and safety until the government obligations upon which gold mny bo demanded from tho treasury are with drawn from circulation nnd collected. This might bo done, as has been heretofore recom mended, bv their exchange for long term bunds benrlng n low rnto of Interest, or bv their re demption with tho proceeds of such bonds, liven If only the United States notes known as grconbacks wore thus retired. It Is prob.iblo that tho treasury notes Issued In payment ot sliver purchases under the act ot July 14, I89J, now paid in gold when demandod, would not create much dl-turbanco, as I hey might from tlmo to time, when rooolved in tho treasury by redemption In gold or othsrwiso be gradually nnu pruucntiy repiacod by silver coin. This plau of Issuing bonds for tho purposo of redemption certainly appears to bo tho most effective und direct path to tho needod reform. ""'"""' '"'s. iiuwvvur, n woum WJ II step
