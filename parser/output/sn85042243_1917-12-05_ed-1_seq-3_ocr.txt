WEDNE Y. DEC. "K 1917 General Byng Still Clings to Cap­ tured Terrain in Cambrai Region. DEADLY ONSLAUGHTS OF GERMANS WASTED No Sign in Italian Theatre that Austrians Contemplate a New Attack. With the British Army in France, Dec. 5.—That Field Marshal Haig pre­ vented the Germans from breaking through his lines on the €am'brai front discounts the small gains which the enemy hosts achieved yesterday at a terrible cost in life. It means that yesterday's critical period has been successfully passed and that for the second time in four days Field Mar­ shal Haig thwarted what is to be a German attempt to duplicate the Aus tro-German performance in Italy. Germans were collected from the eastern theatre and various parts of the German line in the west. At La Vacquerie the enemy fought his way through the town, and one party pen­ etrated for some hundred yards into British territory. This,,was the ex­ treme gain. The attacking forces se­ cured a very harrow strip of ground *a little north and south of La Vac­ querie, but the British srtill clung grim­ ly to the high ground north of this place. The British commander voluntarily pulled back his line to the west and southwest of Masnieres to make it firmer. This morning the British line was near the western part of Marco ing Copse, but included Marcoing, a small triangular piece of territory, therefore has been sacrificed by the British. Since 8 o'clock last night the line has remained unchanged. A heavy concentration of German guns east of Gonnelieu suffered great­ ly by the excellent British counter battery work. Things appeared much brighter in the British camp this morning. The battle probably has not yet run its course, but the defenders from now on will be in much better shape to handle the situation. AMERICA'S WAR PURPOSES. President Wilson in a message to congress that is regarded as one of the most momentous declarations in American history, again has enunciat­ ed, but more strongly than before, America's purpose in the war. He also asked congress to declare war on" Austria Hungary, the chief ally of Germany, but failed to include in his request Turkey and Bulgaria, Germany's other allies, declaring that, they were "mere tools, and do not yet stand in the direct path of our neces­ sary action." The president reasserted that Ger­ man power as. now constituted must be crushed and that then, when the German people have spokesmen whose words can be believed, "we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price for peace and pay it ungrudgingly." "Let there be no misunderstanding, the president said. "Our'present afad immedaite task is to win the war, and nothing shall turn us aside from it un­ til it is accomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, or money, or of materials, is be iftg devoted and will continue to be devoted to that purpose until it is achieved." Hun Sacrifice* Cease. The Germans, apparently, have ceased the reckless expenditure of lives of their troops in trying to blot out the Cambrai salient held by Gen­ eral Byng's forces. After four days of onslaughts that have been charac­ terized as equalling atoy previously witnessed during the war, only the artillery now is engaged. Although the Germans claim the capture of more than 6,000 British prisoners their attacks and also more than 100 guns, reports from the scene of bat­ tle, both from the British war offi,ce and from correspondents, have indi­ cated that the German loss in men killed, wounded or made prisoner was a terrible price to pay for the very small recovery of lost terrain. while It Is expected further attacks will be delivered on the Cambrai sec torr, which is a salieint vitally men­ acing to the important railroad junc­ tion of Cambrai, with its highways and railroads radiating in all direc­ tions as feeders to the German lines north and south, the British troops are declared not to be in a better posi­ tion to offer stronger resistance to their efforts, it such ft thing is pos­ sible, than heretofore. Astro-Germans Quiet. As yet the anticipated renewal by the Austro-Germans of their infantry Stacks on a large scale against the Italians on the Venetian front has not materialized. The enemy artillery however, continues active from the 50 plateau eastward toward the kfo^atprs of the Piave river. G?e™iif OH the Treninto front the enemy has es­ sayed an attack which was repulsed.

ES Hold3 Compulsory Vaccination Laws of North Dakota are Not Constitutional Wolford, N. D., Dec. 5.—George B. Vermilya. of Towner has brought suit against the board of health of Towner county to test the constitutionality of the compulsory vaccination laws of the state.

FORMS Miss Aagot Raaen, Steele County Superintendent of Instruc­ tion, has Experience Aneta, N. D., Dec. 5.—Miss Aagot llaaen, Steele county superintendent of schools, lay pinned under her over­ turned Ford car for two hours before a traveling medicine vender chanced along and with the aid of a lifting jack raised the machine sufficiently to relieve her of the weight, which was slowly but surely crushing the breath from her body. Miss Raaen whs by this time bleeding freely from the nose and mouth, and, finding that he could not release her unaided, the peddler was forced to proceed some distance to obtain help. When the car was righted Miss Raaen found herself in condition to proceed on her journey, and, unless some internal in­ jury should develop, fehe will be none the worse for her terrifying experi­ ence. WALLA GUILTY ILL WILL BE m_ THURSDAY State Announces thatN Secretary of State will be Tried Imme­ diately Following Pankow Eugene M. Walla, clerk in the auto­ mobile registration department of the secretary of state's office, was arraign­ ed in district court this morning on a charge of embezzlement, to which he pleaded not guilty. Thomas Hall, secretary of state, bound over to dis­ trict court on the same charge, will be arraigned Thursday morning, his counsel being unable to apear today. The state announced today that the Hall case will go on immediately after the trial of Henry Pankow, charged with murder, begun this morning, and that the Walla case will be tried at the conclusion of Hall's trial. The entire morning was consumed in drawing a jury for the Pankow murder case, first on the criminal court calendar. GOPHER SHORTHORN BREEDER BUYS RIO BILLINGS HOLDINGS Fryburg, N. D., Dec. 5—J. C. Mills, a well known Preston, Minn., breeder of Shorthorns, has purchased all of the holdings in. Billings county of W. S. and William Hamilton of Bow­ man, comprising 1% sections of good farming and grazing land. (Continued from Pass One) not wifh~tfie~former Difficulty~piled upon difficulty, and much as he hoped to avoid it, the president was forced to realize: that Austria was being used by Germany in the United States as an active enemy and that nothing less than a declaration of war would clear the situation and leave the govern­ ment perfectly free to carry on the war with Germany in the most effec­ tive manner. Spy System Austrian. The German spy system in the Unit­ ed States today is known to be man­ ned largely by subjects of Austria Hungary, many of them members of the Industrial Workers of the World, and the recent attempts of that organ iaztion to hamper the government's war preparations are traceable to the German system. American secret service men fouqd the trails of the notorious on Papen and Boy-Ed leading through the Aus­ trian consular service in this coun­ try. Every turn of the government to­ ward combatting the German espion­ age system found evidences of how Germany was using Austria. Members of congress and many ad­ ministration officials, realizing the sit­ uation, have for months urged a dec­ laration of war. 

SUSPECTS ARRESTED. Washington, Dec. 5.—Scores of Aus tria-Hungarian subjects suspected of being enemy agents in this country will be arrested within a few hours af­ ter declaration of war against Aus­ tria. Many of these men have been under surveillance by repartment of justice agents foor months, but have not been taken into custody because of lack of definite evidence against them. When congress adopts President Wilson's recommendation that a state of war against Austria-Hungary be de­ clared, unnaturalized subjects of the dual monarchy automatically will be­ come enemy aliens and be subject to summary arrest and internment. For months government ajgents have been gathering information on the hostile activities of Austrians, who were hot subject to the restrictions imposed on unnaturalized Germans by the state of war with Germany, and those caught in illegal acts were ar­ rested and tried under the usual crim­ inal statutes. Many others were free to travel and obtain information val­ uable to America's enemies, however, while keeping their conduct technical­ ly within the law. Department of justice officials were pleased today over the president's recommendation for legislation to ex­ tend enemy alien restriction to wom­ en, some of whom are suspected of being clever aids to the German es­ pionage system, and to authorize more drastic punishment for active alien enemies, such as penitentiary impris­ onment and hard labor.

In the house the war resolution was brought out by Chairman Flood of the foreign affairs committee. The committee itself had been called to meet this afternoon to formally act upon the resolution and return it to the house for passage. The senti­ ment for including Turkey and Bul­ garia! in the list of recognized ene­ mies persisted and there was promise of some attempts to amend the reso­ lution. The committee of both houses, how­ ever, will be guided by the state de­ partment in the language of the reso­ lution, and if the administration has its way, as it probably will. Turkey and Bulgaria will be left for the time when they come directly in the path of America's action against Germany, as the president expressed it in his address yesterday. Wlhile congress is working on the actual declaration of war, the execu­ tive departments of the governments are setting in motion the machinery which will make the declaration ef­ fective. The departmnet of justice began taking steps for disposition of the great number of new alien enemies the war declaration will create. The Many aliens are Czechs, Bohemians and others of the races which have been oppressed by the Austro-Hun garians. Many of them to join the fight, for freedom of their countrymen and realization of national aspiration have joined the American army, waiv­ ing exemptions they might. have claimed as aliens. It is evident that some sort of an exception will be made for them, as the government hardly wishes to treat them as ene­ mies and still wislies to protect itself as far as possible. The department of labor, which hat custody of alien civilians classed as enemies also was making its prepa­ rations to care for them as may be necessary. Senator Stone of Missouri, one of the original "wilful 12" and stout op­ ponent of the government's war plans until war actually was declared, will pilot the Austrian war resolution through the senate as spokesman for th° administration. Since war actually was declared on Germany, Senator Stone repeatedly has announced that the government has his full and unequivocable sup­ port and the administration was so pleased with his attitude that it was decided that, as chairman of the for­ eign relations committee he should have charge of the Austrian war reso­ lution. Senator Hitchcock, the next democrat of the committee, handled the German war resolution. TOO

There are in the United States many sub­ jects of Austria-Hungary who are op­ posed to that government and sympa­ thize with the cause of the United States. Outlining a legislative program in the house today, democratic leader Kitchin said legislation should be con­ fined as far as possible to appropria­ tions and war measures, but that woman suffrage and prohibition con­ stitutional amendments, he expected, would be taken up and voted on be­ fore the Christmas holidays. He said conservation measures would be con­ sidered.
