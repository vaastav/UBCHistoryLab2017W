Weekly citizen. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1887 The Tnoson Sampling Works still continue to do a Rood business. On an average they ship four car loads ot ore per week to El Paso. When our own Btnalter gets in operation this ore -will be reduced here and a clean Bavlng of railroad freight will bo made to the pro ducer. The Mormon recruiting office in New York, is said to be at last closed, and further that the European shipment of converts to that faith, has diminished much of late. This, together with the empty treasury at Salt Lake, is some wVmt rtminnnn of tha downfall of the churoh of Latter Day saints. To-day we yield muoh space to the mes sage of President Cleveland, but finding it impossible to oomplete it to-dBy, will nnhlmh th hnlonoe to-morrow. We hare no anticipation of this message setting the world on fire, but as it is Bnpposed-to emanate from the brain of nnr chief mania trate. we rive the full text of it to'our readers. Secbetabt Lamas, has, as anticipated, been nominatod to fill the Tacancy on the Supreme Bench. His confirmation. however, by the Senate, is believed to be somewhat problematical. His mis chievous interpretation of the Constitu tion in 18G1 is liable to be used to his disadvantage, as likewise are several other public declarations of later days. By his record he will be judged, and on this issue he must stand or falL The Fiftieth Congress has assembled and by the draco of God and Qrover OloTeland, they were privileged to tit two hours in solemn silence and listen to the longest presidential message that contained the least ever sent by rtchief magistrate to that august body. Grover evidently considers Congress but a gathering of asses that need much pres idential advice, hence ho starts them in with ten thousand words and promises them a similar doso later on. The Las Vegas Optio speculates as follows: Annexation to the TJnited States of the northern states of Mexioo promises to become practicable through the new schemes of capitalists. A French syndicate has purchased b vast area of land in the state of Chihuahua, sixty miles long by six miles wide: Frenoh and Belgian immigrants are to be settled on it Another large body of land has been acquired by nn Amerioan syndicate aDd is to be colonized by Amerioan and European immigrants, Already the syndicate has laid out a town adj'oininc Deming.intho territory. The towns will run together and the international boundary line may soon be in the center of the rivals. Then may come trouble whioh may lead to war and a conquest of Chihuahua and with it Coahila, Sonora and Lower California. The first tiffin the Fiftieth Congress was democratic A man by name of Donelson was put in nomination for door keeper. Taublee of Kentucky, said he was a saint, but Breckenridgo of Ar kansas, denonnced him as a sinner. This made Blount of Georgia, mad and he re flected npon Breckenridge. The latter quickly reciprocate "You re another." Blount struck out from the shoulder but was neatly stopped by Breckenridge, who countered on Blount's cheek. Before time was callod for the next round, friends interfered and sep arated them and tho house went to bal- lotting. Donelson rcoeiTed 66 and Hurd of Mississippi 88, tho latter wbb therefore declared elected. Blount and Brockonridgo shook bands and tho gape of war wbb healed. The Democracy bto on the outlook for a tail to their presidential ticket. Cleve land will undoubtedly be the presiden tial nominee and politicians ore inclin ed to the belief that the tail end Mill be found to best wog in Indiana. All efforts to unite conflicting interests and center on Yoorhees, have proven nn availing and a new man must be taken up. CoL Chas. Denby, TJnited Btates Minister to China, has been trotted out 03 a poBBiblo candidate for the vice pres idencr. and the Indiana demooracy is now yelling itself hoarse in his behalf His sentiments on the main political is sues of the day are unknown, but this counts largely in his favor and is the prime cause of the unanimity, as each of the several sections of the hoosier bourbons, fonndly imagines that he thinks as they do. Other states may come in; however, with n favorite son, and in the wrangle Mr. Denby's aspire tions may be lost sight oL Indiana is not the only state that would like to do tho presidential wagging. The total cash in the treasury on De cember 1st, says the National Bepnbli can, was SbM,40,KK, which is an in crease of 310,819,066 in the sum locked up nnd taken from tho circulation through the incapacity of Democrats to govern. As Congress meets on Monday it is not amiss to reoall tho fact that Secretary Manning states that on the 4th of March, 1885, when ho took oharge of the treasury, thero was 8379,166.353 cash on hand. One of tho fiercest bat tie cries of the Democracy in 1884 was that the Republicans were "hoarding four hundred million dollars in the treasury," whioh should "be taken out and distributed among the people' Now, after two years and nine months of Democratic rule thero is 824491,182 more in the treasury than there was when the Republicans wont out of pow er. Will "the Tall Sycamore of the Wabash," who was one of the loudest deolaimers against this "Republican boarding," please rise and explain? Neveb sinoa this old pueblo was a oorporatcd town, has such indifference on the ove of an election, been manifest, For Chief of Police, Oouncilmen and Counoilman at Large, thore is absolute ly no opposition to. the announced can didates- If the several gentlemen as piring to these place?, had not voluntar ily come before the public, these offioea would have gone begging. For Treas urer thero are two candidates Messrs, M. P. Freeman and Demotrio Gil; for Reoorder, three, Messrs. Chas. H. Meyer, R. Starr and W. Jacobs. Judgo Meyer. however, holdf the winning hand. His many years of service have thoroughly familiarized him with his work and his knowledge of he law makes him invalu able in this position. His election is an assured fact as is also that of George Foster, who as Assessor and Tax Col lector, has filled his office creditably and well. In tho race for Treasurer, Mr. Freeman will undoubtedly lead. His well known probity and becoming fit ness for the office will win him many votes. Mr. Gil is a bright young man of exemplary habits, but is much less known to the public than his oompoti tor. MOW BEN 

BUTLER OPT RICH. Bill l n I Men of T-dy May dp Likewlft tf Tbajr Follow Advice Glvn. OpjiAral IL P. Butler bcinc asked foi erxno suggestions on gaining success, Elated that when no was o young lawyer, nmrtlrJnff in Lowell. Mass., a bank pres ident advised him to take his little de posit and buy real estate, from which be eonld to deriving some revenue. Tho general said that he had but little money and was uncertain as to hid future. " Never mind," said tbo bank presi dent, " go to the next public auction oi real estate, bid off a lot with a building 3f flomo kind on it, pay down what money you have and give your promis sory notes lcr ine Daiancc. xou win come out all richt." General Butler saya this advice was good. When a man has obligated him' self, by his notes, to pay money at a cer tain time. It inclines him to economy. He followed the advice, and in time be came the owner ot several parcels ot vai nable real estate in Lowell. Two classes will not bo likely to hood such advice the improvident nnd the over-cautious. The latter will bo ant to say : " It would bo all right but fcr those dreadful promissory notes. They arc always runnlncon and if a man falls eick tlicy do not wait for him to get well." There is this danger, of coarse, but one can make no business venture without some risk, and with the knowledge ac quired by recent investigations oi ue cause of most ordinary ailments, and the means of cure, one runs little risk from that Bource. It Is now known that most of the common ailments have their ori gin In deranaed Iddnevs. They aro the chief blood purifiers of tho system and when disordered a breaking down eome- where is eoon inevitable, because the poison, which in their healthy condition is eliminated, is carried through the en tire system. Put them in order and health returns, C. D. Dewey, a successful man, presi dent of tho Johnston Harvester Com pany, Batavia, N. Y., gives his experi ence as toiiows: In I8S2 my health was failing, ray head pained me constantly, my appetite was uncertain, I could not sleep soundly. I attribute this to the extreme pressure of business cares, but I crew worse, and finally was confined to my bed for two months. It seemed aa thouch I would "never recover " my former health. Under the aid of etimulants I gradually gained strength, so that in a few inontlis 1 was able to attena to nuBinets, but i could walk only with tbo assistance of a cane, and thon in a slow and unsteady manner. I continued somowhat in the Bame condition until February last, when I used Wamor'B safe cure. It has cured ao. I consider it a valuable remedy and can highly recommend it. Younz men have but to uso ordinary prudence, and when any derangement occurs if they use the same means aa did this successful business man, they may feel a constant assurance of their ability to carry to Hiccesstui conclusion ail or dinary business projects, including tho care of their promissory notes when due. TELE&RAPH The Secretary ot the Interior in his recent report on tho Apaches in Arizona, coments somowhat adversely on General Miles' proposition to divide the Apaches among the various military reservations, "The Indians," he says, "were gathered upon their present reservation at great expense, and in pursuanoo of a policy then considered best for their proper management and advancement. To again scatter the various bands to dif ferent localities involves the establish ment ot several zaore agencies, the main tenance ot which, would no doubt, oon siderably increase tho expenditure of the Indian servioo in that locality. In view ot these things I have not felt satisfied to take any final action npon tho proposition until I could gather such information through official reports from the representees of this Depart ment as will enable me to fully consider every phase of tha subjeet. Lead and Copper Market. GorrEB Tho boom in metals has mado further progress during tbo past week, and nearly the entire list of the principal metals has now shared in the improvement in prices. Too movement is conducted by a powerful oombiaation in Europe, who havo managed the whole business in a very skilliui manner. uhUi bars were first of all driven up to a price which could not have been anticipated, and we had again a repetition of the state of affairs which was brought about in 1873, when consumers copper was con siderably cheaper man ino moro specu lative Oh lib bars. This peculiar oondi tion ot things has now, however, nearly disappeared, and during the last few days a largo amount oi business nas been done in all the liner grades or oop- per, which aro found to be getting rather Boarse. Chili bars, whioh closed lost week at 58 15s. cash, ranged on Mon day from 61 to 62 15s.; on Tuesday from 6i 10sTtoG3 15a., and on Wed nesday 57 was touohod, but after some fluctuations prieea fell somewhat and again rose to 66 15s.

It is evident that tbo highly successful operations in tin and copper have now encouraged the manipulation ot lead, and as was the ooso with tin and oopper, London has taken the initiative in this movement Last week tho clos ing price in London for Spanish lead was 12 15s., and it is reported to-day at jeid Dd.$i.io 1U&, with buyers over.

This wrong inliicted upon thoso who bear the burden of national taxation like bther wronga multiplies a brood ot evil consequences.
