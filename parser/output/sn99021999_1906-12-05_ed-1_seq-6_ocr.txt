Thoea who expected sensationalism and eitrenielsni In President Rooee velfs annual message will be as much disappointed as those, if any, who looked for Signs of cessation or reac tion in the policies with which his name and administration have bevn so signally Identified. The communi cation is eminently characteristic, pos itive without rashness, rationally con servative, courageously and aggres sively facing the vital problems of our time, and absolutely candid. It is in exact line with the record of the presi dent, and, as the expression of a man of serious though optimistic spirit, and ripened by experience in high place and arduous effort, will strengthen public confidence in him. There Is Indeed not much of sub stance which is altogether new, be cause of the president's frank hablttof taking the country into his confidence, although emphasis Is put on special points, according to the circumstance and occasion. in.vlew of this Juncture. Even with reference to taxation of in heritances and of Incomes, which are the two points that will likely engage the most serious attention of the coun try, the position taken by the presi dent la rather the notable development ot a consistent fundamental attitude towards present national problems than the sudden proposal of a novelty, an attitude, too, which was not I?88 distinct In his earlier potent stand for national control of interstate rallronfltf. The president had la previous public utterances, beginning many months ago in an address at Washington, fore shadowed the views strikingly elab orated in favor of national taxation of inheritances rated according to bulk. The companion proposition of an In come tax grows out of the same funda mental attitude, which is every day more representative of the serious thought of the country. It Is not prob able that the president expects that these progressive adjustments will be legislatively made at the present ses sion, but the fact remains that he has fixed upon them the . popular mind in a way that will bear fruit. In otherwise urging action upon congress the president deals with liv ing questions, whether, it be labor and capital, national marriage and divorce laws, alienation of coal lands, em ployers' liability or a score of other practical recommendations. It is a message in which obsolete tradition or tread-mill routine are displaced by liv- Ing realities, and which voices a gen uine sympathy with the mass of a great, virile, ' constructive people in their struggle to solve rightly many hard and pressing 'problems and fo have their government responsive to their needs and opportunities. 

COLORADO COAL DISCRIMISATI0X8. The Interstate Commerce commission at Pueblo, Colo., in spite of strenuous objection by the railroads, is admit ting Into Its records most sensational testimony, showing rebates and dis crimination in coal rates for hauls be tween points within the state. The discriminations are of the grossest and most outrageous character and seem to be systematic rather than excep tions to 'the rule on which the local charges are fixed. In the majority of the Instances established by the testi mony the range of discrimination is 100 per cent, in one case, however, where the published rate Is 1.75 a ton, as low as 36 cents a ton was con ceded to favored shippers for Identi cally the same haul. Whether these intra-state dis criminations fall within the op eration of the national law or not, the commission is performing an Invaluable public service by securing publicity of the facts. They demon strate to what lengths of Injustice be' tween shippers the carrier corpora' tlons will go when unrestrained by public authority. Every state, too, is thereby Blgnally warned ot the pressing necessity to see to it that its laws for abolishing such abuses be assimilated to the amended national law. These Colorado disclosures are im pressive, moreover, for the fact that in all cases where 4 per ton is charged to one shipper and only $2 per ton to another for the same haul, it is the big corporation or combination that gets the low rate and the Independent shipper and the small dealer or shipper from whom the excessive charge ' is extorted. OUR FAULT WITH JAPA. If there be bitteruess and resentment in Japan for the, experience ot bo rue of its cltlsens in San Francisco and a few other localities in the Pacific coast states, the stand taken by the preslden In his message ought to go far to re move it. Beyond question, his con demnatlon ot prejudice against and un- civil treatment ot Japanese residents and their children in public schools or elsewhere, and especially his de mand for full concession by local authority of their rights and protec tion therein under treaties, precisely as we expect Americans to be treated abroad under like conditions, ex presses the overwhelming sentiment in thla country. It shou.d deter the Japanese from transferring indigna tion on account of wrong at the hands of individuals or a locality to a na tion which unreservedly deplores and condemns the wrong, and it should at least put the matter on a friendly rather than a hostile basis for settle ment, which will be gain of a vital point. But the president gives a guarantee of good faith by going to the root of the matter with a request to congress for additional power conclusively to remedy such grievances, where local authority snl sUte and municipal laws are at fault, lie could, hardly put luto words more forcefully his determina tion to use to the uttermost every ex isting power of the national executive under the law as it stands, defective though It Is. There Is indeed no more grotesque and dangerous absurdity than that which has been so long tolerated be tween the national and state Jurisdic tions with reference to foreign com plications. It is a hazardous anomaly that the mob of a slnle city may at any time perform acts of lawless vio lence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us Into war, and the president does not put it too strongly when he declares that "There should be no particle of doubt as to the power of tho national government completely to perform its own obliga tions to other governments." While the Japanese difficulty is grave when considered by itself, it really raises the whole question of our na tional sufficiency for the plainest in ternational obligations, and the chief part of the difficulty in the San Fran cisco case arises from our failure so long to settle the fundamental princi ple. That matter cannot be settled too soon, once for all. 

OMAHA AS A MILL1SO CKSTKR- The progress made by the Omaha grain market during the last two years has again directed attention to the fact that, while Nebraska lsne of the greatest grain-producing states In the union. Its milling industry amounts to practically nothing. Two-thirds of the annual wheat crop Is shipped elsewhere to be milled; the corn that is milled in Nebraska is but a very small percent age of the total crop; practically no oats are prepared for consumption in Nebraska. This condition has been recognized for a long time and has been given more or less perfunctory thought. The time has come when the situation must have serious consid eration. There s no reason why Omaha should not have a milling In dustry worthy of the name. Condi tions were no more favorable at Kan sas City when the start, was made there, and yet the mills of that city have grown to a proportion where they are second to none, save those of Min neapolis. This is a matter that should be taken up for action by the Omaha Com mercial club. Much tentative work has been done, but the concrete re sults have not as yet been attained. The same vigorous efforts that brought the grain exchange into being would also bring the mills. The country is full ot capital seeking Investment and nowhere does there appear a more at tractive Investment than is offered in this. The consideration now being given the eubject should produce some definite showing before another crop Is harvested. ChiUtmas exposition week in Omaha opened most auspiciously. The prepa rations made by the local retailers for the accommodation of their customers were never more complete, nor was a more attractive display of seasonable good ever made. The enterprise ot these gentlemen is undoubtedly appre ciated by the public and they will reap their reward in a business that is cer tain to exceed that of any. previous year in Omaha. The campaign against dangerous street signs should not detract public attention from the dangerous bill board, Omaha has already been amerced in a large sum owing to the presence on the street of a structure that should be prohibited by law. The billboard is not only a menace to life and limb, but is an eye-sore, as well. before the dnngerous sign is removed the billboard. ought to come down. When perusing the monthly report ot the operations of the Nebraska treasury department, bear in mind that two of the great railroad systems of the state have for three years persist ently refused to pay the taxes levied against them. When the time comes, as it must come, that these moneys are paid In, the treasury not only of Ns LrHHka, but of a number of Nebraska counties, will be greatly benefited. Treasurer Morteiisen announces an other reduction in the floating debt ot Nebraska ot $274,000. Tbe showing made is- a good one, but it must be re called that the reduction is made possi ble only by a special levy for the pur pose. When the railroads come to pay their Just share of taxes In Nebraska this floating debt will not only be ex tinguished, but the general tax rate will be reduced. . The loss to the Union Pacific shops emphasizes more than ever the neces sity ot fireproof construction. Valua ble papers and patterns stored In a cheaply constructed building are al ways exposed to great danger of de struction. The decision of the United States supreme court in the Moyer case will be received with pleasure by officers whose efforts to capture suspected per sons have often been fulled by respect for "state's rlgh's." With Governor maoou acting for Cuba and Secretary Root for the United States, the new Isle of Pines treaty should be satisfactory to the United States, If not to the Americans on the island.

EARLY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. Get Baay Now and Secanre tbe Pick of the Goods. Cleveland Lader. It Is not too early to make plans for any structures Jutting from the building Christmas.

JE1ATOHS BV fOPlLAK VOTE. Slgalflrance of the Interstate Coavea tloa at Dea Moines. Washington Btar. An Interstate convention will meet at Dee Moines, la., next Wednesday whose object Is "to effect the crystallisation of public sentiment; to afford an opportunity (or consultation; to devise plans for co operation between th states, and, It deemed advisable, take steps to secure a permanent organization for the promotion of a movement looking to the election of United States senators by direct vote of the people." Delegates from the following states have been appointed, and Indications are that all the states named will be represented: California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon. South Dakota, Tex!as, Wash ington, West Virginia, Wyoming. Urorgia, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. This should be sn exceedingly Interesting meeting. The subject commands wide in terest, as Is seen by the responses to tho invitations to attend. Northern, southern, eastern and western states are on the list, and :f delegates who speak for and with full knowledge of their communities are encouraged to go on record In support of the general purpose advertised the result should be fortunate for the country. In some quarters there is a belief that practically this battle Is already won. In a number of the states senatorial nomina tions are matle at primaries, and legisla tures by such means are Instructed. This system wherever It has been tried has worked well. Legislatures hav obeyed In structions thus given, and In an hour have performed a service which, under the old system, with Its deadlocks am Its s. and.ils, consumed months. The choices thus made have In the main been excellent, result ing from campaigns before the people con ducted in a way to obtain the best sense of tha electorate. Candidates have prast ntej themselves en the stump, and huve been obliged, either In Joint debate or otherwise, to commit themselves on the issu, s of the day and submit to a thorough examina tion of their records. For this reason objection here and th:e is heard to the proposition to clinch tin matter by a constitutional amendment. Not only, it is urgea. is tne calling or a convention for amending the constitution attended with many difficulties, but why. It is aked, go to so much trouble for what, as has been shown, may be obtained ij easily? Let those states whlrh have not as yet tried the primary plan observe Its workings where It has ben adopted, and they will speedily be convlnved. But even the primary plnn may be Im proved It Is somewhat in the rough at yet. and If the Des Moines convention goes no further than to suggest where the pl.m may be strengthened. It will more thtn Justify It sw-lf and thoea who suggested the meeting. The procwdinse, even with coo ROI KD Allot T HEW TOSK. Rlpalea the arrest t Life I Metrepolla. New York has set out to discover some thing more Interesting to rnitldents gen erally than th north pAe. This Is whether the streets and the sidewalks belong to the people or to the stores and factories oi to th cotnractora who are engaged In the construction of new buildings. Mayor Mc Clellan wants the Information and some remedies warranted to effect a cure. Ac cordingly he has appointd a special com mission of prominent cltlsons to Investi gate conditions and devise rules to be en forced by the city, especially on streets whore a great deal of building Is btlng done. When they report he promises to move vigorously for suppression of existing nuisances, so far aa they ctin be sup pressed. There can be llttie building cur ried on in New York were the contractors absolutely forbidden to encroach on the streets. Plana were filed last week for the new terminal buildings now under construction for the New York A New Jersey railroad, which Is tunneling under the North river. There will be two buildings In Church street, from Cortlandt to rey street, and from Dey to Fulton street. Each will be twer ty-two stories above the eurface. There will be space for 4.000 offices, and when completed it Is said the terminals will constitute the largest office structures In the world. They will be examples ot Italian Rennalsance. P'ossibly by July 1, and positively before the end of next sum mar, If present prospects hold good, trains will be running through the two tubes. This will bo the first connecting link be tween New York and the Jersey shore by an under-rlver tunnel. The Pennsylvania tunnel will furnish a second. The McAdoo tunnel has Its New Jersey terminal close to the Lackawanna depot in Hoboken. I Fifth avenue Is gradually losing Its glory. It Is no longer possible to Ignore the fact that New York's proudest street has be come a street of trade. Art galleries, . an tique dealers and Parisian costumers were the first to Invade It from the southern end. Residents moved farther up, but hotels and great business houses left them no peace. The skyscraper apartment house hobnobs with the exclusive club and the private houses of wealthy men, lordly chateaux and marble villas must bear with what grace they may the intrusion of new comers. The traffic on the street has Increased enormously since the automobile has be come I he rival of the horsed carriage, and congestion Is a common occurrence In spite of the endeavor to restrict the use of the roadway to pleasure vehicles and light carts. To widen the forty-foot street so aa to accommodate three parallel lines of vehicles going in opposite directions the city has decided It necejunry to take six feet from the side pavements, and to give the necessary room for foot passenger aDout to order property owners to remove ' J U"iri 1 1 1 . 1 1 HI c tn ha r n n . .

When nun avenue's character la entirely changed It is difficult to see what other street of the city can tnke the place of the richest residential street in the .nru richest residential street In the world.

During her ride Miss Thornton was hys terical, but when she found herself safe she made Inquiries as to the Injuries of the policeman. He had not only received nu merous lacerations, but his uniform was torn.. As a reward for' his bravery Miss Thornton kissed hltp twice. I "Thank you for the reward," said Cross, blushlngly. Then Miss Thornton hastily railed an other cab and was driven back to the pier, where she boarded the liner Caronla, none the worse for her exciting experience. Ther is a renewal of the police cam paign against "fake" fortune tellers, and several arrests have been made. An ex ample of the influence these nraglc per sons wield over weaker ones was described recently by a policeman. He came across a poor woman who was reduced to poverty by following a fortune teller's advice. The woman lived at the top of a five story tenement. Sh had five children, and while her husband was at work in a sweat shop she took In work and helped to ac cumulate a tidy sum. One day she re ceived a fortune teller's card and, un known to her husband, visited the clair voyant. The sceress questioned her about her means and gleaned enough Informa tion to convince her that her visitor had KtfO and was "easy."
