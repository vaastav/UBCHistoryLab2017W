The presentation of "Henry VIII" at the Crawford last night with Louis James as "Cardinal Wolsey" and Mad am Helen Modjeska as "Queen Kather ine," from all standpoints was the most notable dramatic event of the season. The company includes the names of several of the best known actors of the country, the stage settings were elab orate and technically correct, the cos tuming was done with a lavish hand and still the audience was the smallest that has greeted Madam Modj'eska in Topeka. There were many seats vacant on the first floor and the boxes were but partly filled. Madam Modjeska's abilities are given excellent opportunities in the part of "Queen Katherine" and the great Polish actress appears to far better advantaga in that role than she did in either the part of "Mary Stuart" or in "King John" a year ago. Age has necessarily forced certain limitations upon Madam Modjeska which have been painfully apparent before but as the divorced wife of the King of England she met every requirement with less evidence of age. Madam Modjeska's pronunci ation is of course peculiar but perhaps not distasteful. Madam Modjeska was especially pleasing in the trial scene and in the interview with "Wolsey" and "Campelus." Louis James as "Cardinal Wrolsey" received the largest share of the ap plause after the scene of the fall of the mighty cardinal. Mr. James was last seen here two years ago in "The School For Scandal" and from the jolly, rol licking" part of the Sheridan play to the sedate and all powerful character in the Shakespearian drama is a decided change, but surprising as it may seem Mr. James was as perfect in one .part as the other. It was a decided surprise to see him in the comedy part in "The School for Scandal" after his years in Shakespearian and kindred plays but as surprising as it was he handled the part with a lightness that was remarkable. Then he was deviating from his usunl path and last night he was again seen in one of his favorite roles. As the cunning churchman Mr. James was at his best. He was decidedly more in favor with the audience than Madam Modjeska as the two curtain calls after the farewell to all his future greatness would indicate. From the dancing scene in Wolsey Hall where the cardinal watched the minuet in si lent approbation to the stormy inter view with the king. Mr. James was the perfect master of the part. Norman Hackett made a kingly "King of England." He possessed all the pomp and swagger due the charac ter and made it sufficiently execrable. Several times the audience awarded Mr. Hackett their approval by applause. Thomas Coffin Cooke as "Duke of Buck ingham" received a curtain call after the execution scene. Wadsworth Har ris as "Duke of Norfolk," made up a I z1!mw ' -.1 Immense line of Cel luloid Goods, from 10c tc $10 each. They are bet ter and cheaper than ever.

Miss Aphie James made a charming "Anne Boleyn" and captivated the audience as well as the king. The staging of the play was magnificent but the Crawford stage would not hold all the scenery carried by the company and the regular settings for several scenes were not used and the settings for other scenes were pressed into service to save completely blockading the stage with the two carloads of scenery carried by the company. The council chamber In the palace, Wolsey's hall and the queen's apartments were magnificent and by far the most elaborate stage settings seen here this season. In the third act showing the queen's apartments a Kansas girl held the center of the stage for a time. She was Louise Gale, a lady of the court, and sang the song at the request of "Queen Kather ine." Of all the company of players with Mod jeska this year. Louise Gale is said to be the favorite. The affectionate looks and smiles which Modjeska bestows on Miss Gale during the play are not all "stage business." Madame Modjeska has invited Miss Gale to spend six weeks with her at her own home in San Francisco when the company reaches there. The costume which Miss Gale wore last night In the ball room scene was designed especially for Miss Gale by Madame Modjeska her self. How old is Miss Gale? Well, of course, that's a secret, but on good authority it is stated that she is the youngest by sev eral years of any other actress in the play. Twenty years would not be far from a correct guess. She has been on the stage only two years, both seasons with Modjeska. Last year she played in To peka the part of Arthur in King John, and played it well. Kut she was only an understudy for the part and played here because her principal, Odette Tyler, was sick. For two years prior to going onto the stage Miss Gale studied with teachers in Chicago and New York. Her work was largely in music as it was and is her am bition to sing in opera. That she has an admirable voice for operatic work was demonstrated by her little song last night. Miss Gale enjoys her work thoroughly and speaks of Madame Modjeska in most endearing terms. She admitted last night that she was considerably excited because of the fact that her mother and a num ber of Council Grove friends had come to Topeka to see her, and was more or less worried for fear that she would not please them with her acting. She received sev eral immense boxes of roses from friends during the performancee. Miss Gale's mother does not travel with her. but expects to accompany her from Topeka as far west as Salt Lake City. Mr. Gale is a well-to-do lawyer in Coun cil Grove. A BUKGLAB SCARE. How Mrs. Diggs Mat a Severe Disappointment. A few nights ago in the stillness of the wee sma' hours mysterious sounds were heard in the house occupied by Mrs. Annie L. Diggs, state librarian, and her daughter, Miss Mabel Diggs, and Miss McLallin. They were alone in the house at the time. The strange sounds awoke one of the trio and she awakened the other two. They listened a few moments and then heard sounds which indicated that some one was moving about in the kitchen. Naturally they hesitated about tackling a burglar unarmed, and their first thought was to summon a policeman. No one of them wished to go for an officer alone, and if either two went the third one did not wish to stay alone in the house with the burglar, so all three hurriedly dressed and started to find a policeman. The house stands on Twelfth street, west of the car barns and not far fro-n them. It was hastily decided to go to the street car barns and telephone from there for an officer, but before they had gone far they met two men. "Is there a police station at the car barns?" gasped Mrs. Diggs excitedly. "She means is there a telephone there," corrected Miss Mabel. "We've got burglars in our house," said Miss McLalllin. The men offered to go back with the trio and reconnoitre the premises. The offer was gratefully accepted. They marched boldly into the house, expect ing to scare the burglars out, but no burglars scared. They listened a mo ment, but not a sound could be heard. At length there were sounds again as of some one moving about in the kitchen. A light was secured and the men broke into the kitcher, while the women held their breath expectantly. The room was empty, but a search re vealed a rat. At least this is the story that is told by the two men. III Chairs "ifV?"!? Rockers 'y''"8"8 Each. STAYSJOWN. Submarine Boat Fnlton Sinks at Her Pier And Resists Efforts to Bring Her to the Surface. DUE TO AS ACCIDENT. Hatchway Was Left Open by Some Workmen. Water Got Inside and Took Her to the Bottom. Workmen Succeeded in Getting Her Up With Little Damage. New York, Dec. 11. The submarine torpedo boat Fulton, which sank at her dock at New Suffolk, L. I., on Monday was raised today. The only damage done the boat was by the water that poured into her through the open for ward hatch. Her bottom was not dam aged. After her machinery has been overhauled and cleaned, the vessel will be as good as ever. The boat went down almost at the same spot where she underwent her fifteen-hours' test under water about two weeks ago. The accident happened while her com mander, Captain Cable, was in New York on account of the illness of his wife. In order to repair an exhaust valve, the crew raised the stern of the Fulton under a derrick is the air. One of the forward hatches had been left open, and as the stern was raised and the bow was submerged the craft filled with water. By the time the stern was lowered the boat sank in about fif teen feet of water. At the offices of Isaac L. Rice, presi dent of the company it is stated that in view of the fact that the work of re floating the boat was begun so soon, it is thought that the damage from salt water to the delicate iron and steel ma chinery will not amount to anything, owing to the short duration of the ex posure of the machinery to water. A force of twenty men will be put to work on the Fulton to clean and oil her parts as soon as she is afloat and put her in shape for her sea trip to Washington in company witn a convoy of the com pany's vessels. In the event of any part of the Ful ton having been irreparably damaged, the company will use a duplicate part from the Adder, her sister ship, now be ing built for the government. Her elec tric battery, with which she is propelled, will probably have to be replaced. As soon as Captain Cable reaches New Suffolk it will probably be known how soon the boat will be able to go to Washington. EXPECTED NEXT WEEK. Leland's Nomination Will Go to the Senate. It is understood that the nomination Of Cyrus Leland to the Topeka pension agency 'will be one of the first that will be sent to the senate for confirmation the coming week by President Roose velt. In fact it may be looked for al most any time between now and De cember 19. If for any reason, it should be delayed beyond that time it will go over until after the holidays, as con gress has set Dec. 19 as the dat on which the holiday recess shall com mence. The Burton faction is now claiming that the president has determined to leave the appointment to whoever a majority of the Kansas delegation in congress shall agree upon, but it is un derstood that Mr. Leland would get it even if this should be done, for he is said to have at least a clear majority of the Kansas congressmen on his side.
