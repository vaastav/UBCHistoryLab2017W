Richmond gispatch. WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 3,1SC5>. The President's Message-Georgia, &c. We presented in what we bad to nay yes terday of this message its principal feature . It is a very frank and straightforward doc? xncnt. Devoid of the art of political diplo macy, which teaches men to cover up their real motives in skilful verbiage,is alUhc more entitled to the favorable consideration of the free and the generous, who are nei ther partisans nor diplomat1st*. We tffcre frank In expressing our own opinions, aud find no reason to modify them. We think Georgia should be left to manage her own affairs now. Wo look upon her as having committed a great blunder, and she is likelv to suffer for It: but we regret that General Grant deemed itpecessai? to bring the subject before Congress. Wo do not think It timo yet to obliterate State lines, in a political sense, and had hoped that at least some semblance of the local State authority would be allowed to remain until the period arrived iu the proper progress of events for the in stillation of complete arbitrary authority. But this is a matter not for us of the South to settle. It rests with those who have the power, Georgia representatives have been admitted, and according to the reeoustruc tion laws she is a State in the Union. The Legislatures and the natioual Congress are alike declared constitutionally the judges of the qualification of their own members ; nnd the Congress has exercised the right as much in dorogation of the constitutional rights of persons elected to that body ns ha< the Georgia Legislature. There has been, however, no power to Interfere for the protection of the persons thus wronged. The right of the Congress sprang from the Constitution, and there was no tribunal to question the manner of its exercise; for that would have taken away the rieht. Sothat if the Georgia Legislature errs in judgment, it does so in the exercise of a constitutional right which there is no power established under the Constitution to call in question. Now, if Congress may cri ticise the act of that Legislature, and reform the body itself for what it considers an error of judgiuant and an infringement of individ ual rights, wc ask what limit is there to its Interference, and what .State is protected from its scrutiny nnd its overriding dictum." Nevertheless, let us not forget that Geor gia committed a great error, and, in our opinion, denied to persons with every eon Ftitutiouul claim to seats in the Legislntun the right to take those seats. We are not sufficiently far removed from the arbitrary authority authorized in war to escape tb? consequences of acting in contempt of the prejudices engendered by the war and the statutes emanating from those prejudices We consider the southern btatesas acting under duress for the fulfilment of those laws, and it is folly for them to resist them. We especially invito the attention of Vir glnlans to this matter, and urge the pro priety, even after their representatives arc admitted to the floor of Congress, of calm ness, forecast, and prudence. T It will be yet some time, wo imagine, be fore the Federal Government ceases to re flect the opinions, and prejudices if you please, of tho northern people through their representatives elected at least a year ago, nnd who will not much advance be yond those prejudices until another elec tion, whoso successful men will not take their scats until two years from last Mon day. So the mettlesome spirits and the Bourbons may not deem that they are out of the woods to cut their capers at will, free from observat Ion and restraint! Let us add that there would not only be folly in any such conduct, but iuexcusablc obstinacy and blindness. The new order of tiling? exacts of us new duties as well as policies, and to disregard them will be at least sub jecting us to the daugcr of Federal interpo sition, and would beyond question obstruot the ndvancf^nent of our physical interests. Recurringto the message : GcneralGitAKT is not forgetful of our foreign affairs. He Informs Congress that be has taken mea sures to ascertain the practicability of a oanal across the Isthmus of Darien, so im portant an enterprise to our commerce, the more especially since the construction of the Suez canal. The only Important foreign question save that with regard to Cuba in that with refer ence to the Alabama claims, in which the President involves himself in an incon sistency to which our "Washington corre spondent yesterday called attention. The President is disposed to hold England ac countable for damages upon our commerce because she " prematurely " recognized the Southern Confederacy, while in reference to Cuba he claims that "this nution is 41 its own judge U9 to when to accord 44 the right of belligerency." Laying down the proposition that the nation would rest more easily under a wrong wholly uuatoued than under an unsatisTay tory settlement, the President informs us that he concluded that the state of feeling after the rejection of the Johnson treaty was not favorable to the immediate renewal of negotiations. In this sentiment England ooncurred; but the President hopes that the time is not distant when a settlement may he effected, including the laying down of a broad principle of public law which may prevent future differences. The President is very frank relative to the tcnure-of-office law, which ho urges Congress to repeal at once. It cripples the Executive and injures the public service. He contends that it was never the intention of the framers of the Constitution, " in u providing that appointments made by 44 the President should receive the consent 44 of the Senate, that the latter should have 44 the power to retain iu office persons ** placed there by Federal appoiutment 44 against the will of the President." Very true; and we shall have on this point a re newal oi the war between the Senate and the Executive. The President makes some excellent sug gestions upon the subjects of naturaliza tion, the regulation of immigrant ships, In dian affairs, &c. He objects, justly, and strenuously, to the seeking the protection of this country-, through naturalization, by persons merely to pursue avocations in for eigu lands freed from the claims of those luDds, on the ground of their altered alle giance. General Gbant urges the increase of the salaries of the judges of the Supreme Court, which have not been changed iu fifteen year's, while the expeuses of living have been dou bled. The message, on the whole, 1? commend ed for that independent and undisguised spirit which will meet with popular sym pathy. We applaud General Grant for his persistent good faith towards Virginia, and whatever may be the opinions of our people on his general policy tbey cau never fail to be grateful to him for his conduct towards thia State. How to Do It.?The Postmaster-General recommends that the postage on all printed . matter be required to be prepaid. Very U8 have no trouble about it. the whole sent from one printing office together, and charge ?o much A pound?a few ceuta. The fact that it la in the mail bag will be evidence enough that it has been prepaid. The Richardson Sensation. The friends of the murdered Richardson, including the Rev. Bef.chkr and his suitable confrere the Rev. Frothingham, have sin ned grievously against the deceased and against society by the prominence which they have given the Richardson case and the detestable morality with which they have clothed it. Richardson and the lady deserved all the charity of society. Trans gression brought sorrow, and that might have been properly comforted with pity and forbearance. But to convert their con duct into purity nud propriety and to sanc tity their sympathies with tho cloak of virtue was a great outrage. The New York Times justly declares: " We are reluctantly compelled to pro test once moro against the wild and iero clous shouts for vengeance which are being raised by a few journalists round MeFar land's prison door. We doubt whether a more disgraceful outrage on public morals has ever been committed in this commu nity than is involved in the open scorn of the marriage tie and the total disregard of all principles of justice which professed ministers .of religion and public writers have managed to display." " Rev. Dr. Collyer, of Chicago, preached a sermon in Washington, Sunday, in which he commented upon the AlcFarland-Rich ardson tragedy, and criticised in severity the conduct of Vice-President Colfax, wb<? the reverend doctor represented as 4 beard ing the lion in his den,' (Brigham Young in Utah) there getting off a homily upon the sanctity of marital relations, aiid now 'scattering flowers of sympathy upon the bed of a spiritual adulterer. " The last meeting of the Woman's Rights Club, In New York, was devoted to the consideration of the marriage relation, and one speaker avowed her predilections for 'Tree love" on the ground that lovo was "free," and the married relation was only endurable as long as it was agreeable. That the women present did not with one voice exclaim against the doctrines of the speaker proved that they were approved. This Club is a considerable affair, both for the numbers and the talents of its members. They have tea at Delmonico's once a week, we believe, and discuss their theories with great boldness. They invite leading men to be present, and arc occasionally honored with the presence of editors and statesmen, whom they catechise sharply. It is a fea ture of the times, but one that has never appeared in Old Virginia or, we believe, the South ; aud never may it.
