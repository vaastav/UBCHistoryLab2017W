TOTAL EcLirsE OF THE MOON. —There will 'be a total eclipsc of the moon early on Sun day night, December 6th, throughout the whole United States. The moon, however, will be ftequently visible, and in color resem bling a copper disc. The eclipse occurs here about midnight. PAINFUL ACCIDEXT.—Mrs. Wagner, resid ing in Grandview, Louisa county, whilst com ing down the stairs from Evans' photographic gallery, yesterday about noon, caught on the steps in some manner and was thrown down, alighting on her hands and dislocating both wrists. Dr. Cobb, Asst. Surgeon of the 35th regiment, and E. R. Wright, Hospital Stew ard, were called, and replaced the bones. IMPORTANT TO FARMERS.—Notice is given in another column by the Assessor for this county which will be of interest to all farmers, as they are not generally aware of the fact that they are required to report to the Asses sor monthly the number of cattle, hogs, sheep and calves slaughtered by them and to pay a tax thereon. He also gives notice to the owners of luxuries in the shape of buggies, &c., worth over seventy-five dollars, and all silver ware and plate over forty ounces, to re port the articles, so they may be properly taxed. A QUKES "BIRD."—Jacob Compton, Esq., of this city, has come into possession of an animal, (reptile or insect,) which is consider­ able of a curiosity in its way. It is about 5 inches long, and shaped like a common lizard. Its skin is nearly like that of a catfish, its head, also, bearing a slight resemblance to that species of fish. It has four feet, which are shaped somewhat like the human hand. Its natural element seems to be water. It may be seen at Mr. Compton's store, where it Is kept in a jar of water, and is doing as well as could be expected under the circum stances." HEALTHY. The hospital at Camp Strong contains at the present time only two patients —one of whom is confined with a broken leg, the other with tlje measles. If there is any other regiment in the service that can show a less amount of sickness in its ranks than this we should be glad to hear from it. The Gray Beard regiment has proved itself able to en dure the fatigues and privations of camp life, as well, and indeed better, than those com posed of young men. Their present experi ence on the Island" we take as rather a :severe test, the situation and the condition of things there being, in view of the winter sea son, not in all respects such as the health and absolute comfort of any regiment wonld seem to require. 

COKCBSNIKS LAND,—A big rush for the West, the coining Spring, is confidently look, ed for, equal, probably, to the best days of "fifty-four" and "five." The majority of these emigrants will be good substantial far mers, seeking a h5me on our fertile prairies, of which they have heard such marvelous stories. These men, or the majority of them, will, at least, seek for lands at the hands of persons,who devote their entire attention to the buying and selling of land. The oldest, end in fact the only firm in our city, the members of which give their entire attention 'to this business, is that of C. O. Hayes & Bro., whose advertisement may be found in ^another column. They established an office iin this city for the purpose of buying and veiling lands about eight years since, in which time they have been the channel through which large quantities of lands liave changed owners. They have, of course, pasted themselves up in the meantime, and are well acquainted with the farming lands of this county. Persons having any busi ness to transact of this nature can leave it in no better or more competent hands. THE REVENUE STAMPS.—Commissioner Boutwell announces that on and after the 1st of December, the use of nine varieties of stamps will be compulsory, under the penalty prescribed by law. They are as follows: Playing cards, proprietary, express, telegraph, insurance, life assurance, fire and marine, passage tickets and protest. The stamps, in sufficient quantities for use east of the Rocky Mountains, are ready for distribution. The provision in relation to the affixing of stamps states that on and after October 1st (extended to January 1st) all instruments, documents or paper of any description what soever should be duly stamped by the maker of the instrument, wbo /shall also cancel the stamp by writing his initials thereon. Any person making such instrument, without af fixing the proper stamp, shall be liable to a fine of $50, and such instrument or paper shall be deemed invalid. The receiving of a .non-stamped paper is a violation of law, as is :also the attaching and canceling a stamp on such paper by the person receiving it, and the (cancelation of a stamp by any, other (than the maker of the instrument, is equally improper. The stamps on bank checks at tach only to checks amounting to twenty dol lars and upwards. There has been no stamps of any description, with the exception of stamps for bank checks, (which were brought on by our bankers, of whom they may be procured,) brought to this city. We would therefore advise those of our eitizens who are obliged to use the above described papers.to immediately send for them.

JATHOME.—Dr. C. O. Waters arrived at his home yesterday from Cairo and below, where he has been for some time. He reports the Muscatine county boys in the different Iowa regiments he has visited as being in good health and spirits. We are under obligations to him Memphis papers of a late date. 

BADLY WANTED. A bridge over Cedar river is a want felt by all classes—merchants and farmers alike. There is a large district of country on the other side of the Cedar to the productions of which Muscatine is the natural market and outlet. Nearly half of our trade comes from the Cedar valley—one of the richest sections of country in the West. This trade is of incalculable value, and the loss of it would be seriously felt by our city. There is not, to our knowledge, a single bridge across Cedar river. This should not be. The immense amount of country beyond this stream, tributary to this city, should have at least one bridge, by which farmers might bring their produce to market without interruption. At this season of the year, when the ice is running, it is an utter impos sibility to get across. Muscatine thus loses for a time, at least, a large amountuof trade which she would otherwise receive. This is not, perhaps, the most important consideration. In the summer, when the river is in its ordinary stage of water, it can not be forded, and farmers are thus obliged to pay ferriage, which is no inconsiderable item in times like the present, when produce rules low. If a bridge was built across the Cedar now, next summer should see an increase to our trade such as would astonish the "oldest inhabitant." We hope to see this matter, which has been broached before, agitated more earnestly and perseveringly than ever, and that a move will be made before the Board of Supervisors, at their next meeting, in January, to hare a bridge erected soon. By *U jMps^us have a bridge across Cedar* TELEGRAPHIC. Synopsis of tlio President's Message. WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. The following is a synopsis of the Prcsi dent's Mes-age: He s!»j\s the correspondence touching for cign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted, in compliance with the request to that effect. The coiuli tion of our relations with other nations is less jp-atifyin£than formerly, though it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted might have reasonably apprehend ed. A blockade of three thousand miles of sea-coast could not be established and vigor I ously enforced in a season of great coinnier dftJ activitV) ,lke the prescnt) through the mails. lnit'ing occasional mistakes, and inflicting Mr. Cox offered a resolution that, as many citzens of tin United States have been arrested and carried out of the jurisdiction of the Stato never given by the people to their rulers, and prepared to redress. I have proposed to some do hettbv demand that all such arrests shall i of the foreign States interested a mutual con herrafter cea=e, and that all persons so arres te 1 and yet held, shall have a prompt and public trial, according to the provisions of tho Constitution and laws of the United States. The motion was laid on the table by a vote of 40 to 80. Mr. Richardson offered a resolution that the President be requested to inform the House what citizens of Illinois are mw con fined in any fort or place of confinement, and upon what charges such citizens were arrested. 

WASHINGTON, D«c 2. HOUSE.—A bill was passed that all judge ments now pending, or hereafter brought for collection, or in receiving duties or other monies due the United States collectors or other officers, shall be paid in gold or silver coin. A resolution was adopted, instructing the Military Committees, to inquire into the expe diertcy of advneing the pay of privates to $15 per month, and reducing tha pay of offi* cors not on actual duty. without com unintentional injustice upon foreign nations and subjects. In clear cases of this kind, I have, as far as possible, heard and redressed complaints by friendly powers. There is, in which they reside, and imprisoned in niili- however, a large and augmenting number of tary prisons and camps, without any charge being preferred against them, and as such arrests hive been made in States where there is no insurection, doubtful cases, upon whi :h the Government is unable to agree with the Governments whose protection is demanded by the claim ants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United States, or her citizens, suf fer wrongs from the naval or military author ities of foreign nations, which the Govern ments of those nations are not at once vention, to examine and adjust some of these complaints. J'liis proposition has been made espi.ciully to Great Britain, France, Spain and Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but not yet formally adopted, AFRICAN K.V1GRATION. Applications have been made to ine by many free Americans, of African descent, to favor their emigration, with the view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad, some from interested and other mo tives, have suggested similar measures, while on the other hand, several of the Spanish American Republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respec tive territories. Under these circumstances, I have therefore declined to move any such col onies to any State without first obtaining the consent of its government, on its part to re ceive and protect such emigrants in all their rights as freemen and I have, at the same time, offered to the several States situated in the tropics, or having colonies there, to ne gotiate with them subject, to the ad vice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective territories, upon condition, which shall be equally just and humane. Liberia and Hayti are yet the only coun tries to which colonists of African descent from here could go with the certainty of be ing received and adopted as citizens, and I regret to say that such persons contemplating colonization do not seem so willing to emi grate to these countries as to some others, nor so willing, as I think, as their interest demands. 1 believe, however, that the opin ion is improving, and that there will be aug mented a considerable emigration to both of these countries. Our relat ons with Mexico and European States remain undisturbed, and with the States of our continent have im proved, especially with Mexico, Costa, llica, &c. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. SENATE.—The standing committees are tho same as last session, with the exceptions of Sumner in the place of Simmons on Finance, and Mr. Arnold in the place Mr. Thompson on Commerce. SUNDRY SCIENTIFIC HEASUBSS. The President is in favor of an Atlantic Telegraph and of extending the Pacific line to connect with that being extended across the Russian Empire. He thinks the mineral resources of the ter ritories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues. It is worthy of serious consideration whether some extraordinary measure to promote that end cannot be adopted. The means which suggests itself most likely to be effective is a scientific exploration. THE WAR 

EXPENDITURES. The vast expenditures incident to the mili tary and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion has hitherto been met with a promptitude and a certainty un usual to similar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. The con tinuance of the war, however, and the in creased disbursements made necessary there to demand your best reflection as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue.— The suspension of specie payment by the banks made large issues of United States Notes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfaction of the other just demands be as economically or as well provided for. It is extremely doubtful whether the circu lation of United States Notes, payable in com and sufficiently large for the wants of the peo ple, can be permanently, usefully and satis factorially maintained. Is there any other way in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made, and the great ad vantage of a safe and uniform currency se cured A GENERAL BANKING PROJECT. I know of none which promises so certain, and at the same time is so unobjectionable, as the organization of banking associations un der a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such associations the Government might furnish circulating notes, on the security of U. S. bonds deposited in the Treasury. These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, be ing uniform in appearance and security, and convertible always into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of vicious cur rency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges. A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and dis tribution of the notes. And under such a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions, the Government might furnish to such associations circulating notes on the security of a general supervision of the sys tem, and it would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as security. The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved, and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated, by the steady market de mand for Government bonds which the adop tion of the proposed system would create. It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight in my judg ment, that it would reconcile, as far as possi ble, existirig interests, by the opportunities offered to existing institutions to re-organize under the act, substituting the secured, uni form, national circulation for the local and various circulations now issued. THE PUBLIC REPORTS. just thatit be done at a common charge? and if, with less lnouey oi money more easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of th Union, by this means than we can by the war alone, is it not economical to do it The proposed emancipation would shorten this war, perpet uate peace, insure the increase in population, and proportionally the wealth of tho country. The President then says the plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption, nor will the war or the proceedings under the proclama tion of September 22d be stayed because of the recommendations of this plan. Its time ly adoption, I doubt not, would bring restora tion, and thereby stay both and notwith standing this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide by law for compensating any State which may adopt the emancipation before this plan sh til have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed. This plan is hereby recommended as a means not in conclusion of but additional to all others for restoring and preserving the National authority throughout the Union.— The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan is proposed as a permanent constitutional law. 

PACIFIC RAILROAD AND ILL. SIIIP-CANAL. He suggests the earliest completion of tho Pacific Railroad also a favorable action by Congress on the projects for enlarging the great canals in New York, Illinois and Mich igan. COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION. The President refers to his compensated emancipation proclamation of Sept. 22d, and says: That portion of the earth occupied by the people of the United States is well adapt ed to be the home of one National family, but not for two or more. In my inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the differences be tween the people of the two sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve.— Physically speaking, we cannot separate—we cannot remove our respective sections from each other, or build an impassable wall be tween them. In conclusion, the President says: The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulties. We must rise with the occasion. The fiery trial through which we are passing will light us down with honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We say that we are for the Union. The world will not forget that while we say that do know how-to save the Union. In giving freedom to the slaves, we insure freedom to the free and honorable alike. In what we give and what we receive, we shall feebly save, or meanly lose the last best hope of the earth. Other means may succeed—this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, gener ous just —the way, which if followed, the world will forever applaud and God must for ever bless.

There is a decided improvement in the financial condition of the Post Office Depart ment, compared with previous years. The Secretary of the Interior\reports that the public lands have ceased to b\a source of revenue. Speaking of Indian affairs, and the recent troubles, he says: I submit for yotir special consideration whether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. He then remarks at length on the difficulty of making any National boundary lines and amending the Constitution. He then suggests amendments to the Constitution, Congress concurring, to be proposed to the Legislatures or to Conventions of the several States, which, if ratified by three-fourths of said Legislatures or Conventions, are to be valid as parts of the said Constitution. The first article proposes that all States abolishing slavery before January 1st, 1900, shall receive compensation from the United States, The second provides that all States freed by the chances of war, any time before the end of the rebellion, shall be forever freed, but all owners who had not been disloyal be com pensated.
