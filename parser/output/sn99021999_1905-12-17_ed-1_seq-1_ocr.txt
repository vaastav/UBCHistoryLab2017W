According, to Present Tlana. I -J. IN. Dec. 16. (Special Cablegram to The lice.) The fi.sral question continues to attract an much attention In Germany an It does In Great Britain. The semi-orllclal statement showed that It li proposed to raise, tlie balance of the $30,000,(00 or $32. t'JO.OOO nf necessary additional revenue, un provided by the contemplated Increase In the duties on beer and louacco, by a variety of methods. First, it is proposed to raise the sum of llO.OuO.MQ from a stamp duty on 

WHIR of freight and bills of lading j tor inland navigation und Inland traflic on tha railways. (Secondly, the provision of j e3.u00.000 is anticipated from the Imposition of a Ktamp duty upon steamship and rail- j way tickets, but the duty will uot npph- 1 to sea-going traffic, In order that this traffic may not be hampered against foreign com petition. Tho senle of duties will vary acordlng to the price of the ticket. No Ucket will be dutiable which cost less than two marks and the result of this restriction will be to make fourth-class railway tickets free of duty for a distance of 100 kilometers and third-class tickets free of duty for the distance of sixty kilometers. Further It Is proposed to raise something like )l,0C0.0no by Imposing an annual tax of from 100 to 150 marks on motor cars, ac cording to their size, nnd a duty, the amount of which Is not stated, but which will vary In accordance with the horse power. Motor cabs, motor omnlbusses and motor carriages for tho conveyance of goods will bo excepted.' The hope Is ex pressed that the motor car Industry will not be prejudicially affected by the new lax which Is expected to fall principally upon tha well-to-do section of the com munity. Another H.OOO.noO Is expected from the contemplated Imposition of a receipt stamp duty of ten pfennigs upon receipts for amounts over 15. Imperial Death Unties. There remain some II 2.500. 000. which It la proposed to raise by the introduction of imperial death duties. These will be Im posed upon Inheritance on a scale ranging from 4 to 20 per cent in accordance with the degree of kindred of the heir and the 'value of the" Inheritance. Inheritance under $76 wltll bo exempt from duty and the lowest tax on the scale will be im posed upon inheritances exceeding $125,000 In value. When the heirs axe the children or the husband or the wle of the testator the Inheritance remains free of duty. It Is anticipated that this tax will yield some $12,500,000; but at least one-third of. the pro need will be restored to the federated states In order to compensate them for tho revenue which they have hitherto derived from their state death duties, alnoe they will now surrender this source of Income In favor of the empire. Apart from this restriction the amount of the proceeds of the death duties which will be appropriated by the empire is to be determined from year to year by the an nual finance bill In connection with the estimates. The amount of the appropria tion bill will be decided in accordance with the necessities of the budget after other available sources of revenue have been ex hausted. Among such available sources of revenue the matrlcular contributions of the federated states will continue to be reckoned, but they must not in future ex ceed in amount the repayments which the states receive from the empire. The North German Gazette observes: The conjecture which during the last few days has found expression in the press to tha eflect that it was intended to retleve the separate states from all uncompen sated matrlcular contributions la Incorrect. Th highest amount of such (uncompen sated) payments will be fixed at 40 pfennigs per head of the population, wnicu i per head ot tne population, wnicu means that Itie constitutional oougainin Incumbent on the states in this respect will not be removed, nut win oniy ue iiiiun. iniiy limited In Its application. Taking the popu lation of the country at 60.uu0.0o0, the luml which the separate states might have to' contribute in a given year would thus amount to $n.0u0,0ia, and It would increase with the growth of the population. Meanwhile the main financial features of the- German navy proposition are being dlscusaed at great length. The main finan cial features are aa follows: The total expenditure upon the navy for the next twelve years will amount to $$25,000,000. Of thla aura tha ordinary astlmatea will have to bear $475,000,000 for recurring expendi ture, and. also a portion of non-recurring expenditure, which, in accordance wttb the financial regulations of the last navy law, works out at $360,000,000. or In ail $0,000,000. Thla represents $65,000,000 as the average annual expenditure which will have to be met out of the ordinary revenue. TIBETANS SHOW FRIENDLINESS Const de Lesbaln and Bride Hurt Pleasant Trip to Hoef f World. CALCUTTA, Dec. II (Special Cablegram to The Bee.) Additional reports from the Count de Lesbain of the French legation at Peking and his bride, who recently ar rived In Dar Jelling from Tibet, indicate that he and his bride have established a record In Central Asian travel. On their honeymoon they went north from Peking to Mlnghai, and thence north again, dis covering two buried citlea. They traveled to tbe Gobi desert, discovering a new lake, and returned southwest to Liang Chow, whence they circuited on the north the lake of Koko Nur In Tibet and arrived at lonely Tsaldaa salt swamp. The daring ex plorers reached tbe sources of the Yang Tse Klang river. They endured Incredible hardships and at one time saw no human being for fifty days. They nearly perished on a terrible upland mud plateau, 1,600 feet high only four of their transport animals nurvlvlng. Thence the oeunt and his wife struck south to Lake Plngri Nor and down to the Sang Chu river, avoiding Shigatse on the route from India to Lhasa and com liig straight to Gyanlee. They found the people tf Tibet entirely friendly and at tribute their extraordinary success to th visit of the recent British cxpeditio LORD CECIL ON CHAMBERLAIN Fear that PressInK of F.stremr Policy Will lrtro Party. LONDON, Dec. 16 (Special Cablegram to The Bee.l Lord Hugh Cecil. M. P . sneak ing before the Oxford Union society on a motion regretting the identification of the conservative party with Mr. Chamberlain's fiscal proposals, said that memory went back naturally to two previous occasions, on which a great modern political party had been deeply and seriously divided. The first occasion was in when Sir Hubert Feel adopted free trade. In ISM another great division of party took place, and again that division was created by the action of the leader of the party; but in 1S6. as on the present occasion, the larger part of the party adhered to the Innovator and the smaller part remained of the oid opinion. A great many people were per plexed by the attitude of the prime mini ster, but he thought they overlooked the fart that this discussion had followed lines not very essentially different from, though prolonged over a far greater space of time, than that which took plaee in lbSt. The late prime minister. Mr. Bnlfour. now held a position had all along held the position, which Mr. Chamberlain took up in con nection with the home rule bill. Mr. Cham berlain In those days had proposals of his own, which went far hcyr.nd anything any unionist would now consent to go. He was In the position of a moderat reformer in the direction of home rule at that time, but he was not prepared to go to the full extent to which Mr. Gladstone would lend IjIh party. The same thing might be said with little ehaim of Mr. Balfour at the present time Lord Cecil lilted to augur and he said that he believed that he should j augur truly that the event in the one case as In the other would bo the san.e, and that lc would l round that tne pressing tor- ward of the extreme policy woulu have no other effect than to bring logethere nil those of every shade of opinion who were not prepared to assent to every word of that extreme course. In lSIti and 1)S6 tho party which was split was destroyed, and if Mr. Chamberlain's policy was pressed in all its crude entirety a great division was certain to result. They w.re told by Mr. Chamberlain's admirers that he was a great fighting leader, but Lord Cecil addrd It would bo poor consolation to the con servative party In later years to reflect that It was destroyed in order to Illustrate the unrestrained courage of a distinguished statesman like Mr. Chamberlain. - i 

CONDITION OF TRANSVAAL Kffert of Chinese Miners Forms nh Jrrt of Debate In fonth Africa. JOHANNESBURG. Dec. 16. (Special Ca blegram to The Bee.) As a result of Lord Milner's statement regarding the general benefits accruing for the colony from the importation of Chinese, and Mr. Mackar ness' reply to this statement, no end of figures are being elucidated to show that the population i.nd the trade of the Trans vaal have Increased. The trouble appears to be that accurate statistics of population are not obtainable, but the figures of voters on the rolls, as compared with the census returns for April. 1904, together with the statistics of building operations In Johan nesburg made public In tho speech of the I Consolidated Investment compnny's chair- ! man. argue a striking increase. Then, too, the increase in trade since the arrival of the Chinese is shown by the returns of the customs department and of the railways. : Another Illustration of the Increased pros- j perlty of the general community is afforded by the statistics of native labor Issued by the department of native affairs. During the seventeen months in which the Chinese havo been In the Transvaal, apart from mine laborers employed In the chief busi ness centers of the colony, the number of natives has increased from 65.JC3 to 79.411. These natives earn an average of $15 per month and represent an Increase of tATi.nio monthly paid In wages by the white com- munlty. Another noticeable feature Is that while the native labor In the mines has shown considerable fluctuation during this period, tho natives employed outside tho mines have steadily Increased In number.

BOYCOTT AGAINST .USTRIA MOOTED Independent Opponent of Government ays People lot Hefnse to Pat ronise People Who Are Xot Friendly. VIKNNA. Dec. K (Special Cable gram to The Bee.) The conlllct between far beyond the original point of the word of command and It Is rapidly becoming a niatier of principles which will make tho situation far more difficult to deal with. The country enn no longer be governed to its own advantage with parliament as It is at present constituted. Popular representa tion must he placed on a totally new basis. Those classes which have hitherto domin ated parliament and whose monopoly of power has led the country into Its present distracted plight, cannot he allowed to re- main the sole arbiters in parliament. The first task of the government Is to restore otder In all circumstances. A new election mu.'-t then be conducted with tho program of universal and secret suffrage. Negotia tions with the coalition has not taken place of late nnd will probably not take place in the near future. They are superfluous, inasmuch us the coalition Is not prepared to recognize the rights of the crown an 1 established by tho fundamental statute, j and tlvse rights the King can not forswear without breaking his coronation oath. liaroii i'ejervary acknowledges that the situutlon is very serious, but he is con vinced that after a hard fight the Hun garian people will understand the barren- "l " s.rugsies. i ne reiormaiion ot parliament, li is nopea. Will transform Hungarian politics. One tiling which has been noticed In this connection Is that the struggle in Hungary- is assuming moro and moro of a tinancial and economic character. Cabinet and coalition are striving to break each other's powers of resistance by cuulng off each other's supplies while the bociallsta who operate as Irregular allies of the gov ernment seek to turn to their own advan tage every stroke and counter stroke of the principal belligerents. Advocates Boycott. In the Magyar Orszag M. Louis Holto, a prominent clerical, independent deputy, calls for a complete boycott and blockade of the government, whose material posi tion, he says, must bo rendered untenable. Hitherto only direct taxes have been cut off. Henceforth JndJcsct.JUixes and. state monopolies mu&t'h, placed under the state Interdic t. This system will affect Austrian Interests also. "If we wish to get at the i root," concludes Mr. Holto, "wo must swing the axe moro powerfully. On the day when we begin the Intensive struggle let no single Hungarian support Austrian Industry by purchases and orders." This plan might have its advantages for tho coalition, but would scarcely be as comfortuble as the system pursued hitherto. It Is easy, and In some cases agreeable. not to pay Income tax and house duty, but the question beeomes more serious when luxuries like tobacco and some heavily taxed necessities ot life havo to be dis pensed with. Nevertheless, tho scheme of M. Holto shows that a crisis Is once more working to a head.

RECOLLECTIONS OF O'BRIEN Recently Published Volume Attract ing; Much Attention Among; British Public Men. j ! LONDON, Dec. 16.-(Special Cablegram to i To Bee.)-Th. recollections of Mr. William O'Brien, M. P., Just published, are attract ing universal attention In the British politt cal world. They are published at an op- neral elec- portune time Just before the general tlon. However, there Is considerable re gret that Mr. O'Brien has not brought bis recollections down to a period beyond the Mallow election of 1&S3. As a result the last phase and the most Interesting the closing incidents of Mr, are omitted. For Mr. x-arneu s lire Parnell figures i largely in these fascinating pages. It Is Interesting, for Instance, to have Mr. O'Brien's word for it that in the early eighties Mr. Parnell spoke habitually of Mr. Chamberlain, Sir Charles Dllke and Mr. Shaw Left vie as assured friends.

It is icgaid'd ns an Interesting coincidence by those Inter ested In. the problems t utfottndlng the Norwegian succession that Queen Mnud begins here residence In Chtistianla exactly ; 500 years from the date on which another i English princess, Phillppa, the daughter of Henry IV. was married to ono of the of DtnmarH and Norway.

Then Nor- way had fallen on the unfortunate and the Inglorious days of the Kalmnr union. Now it has vindicated more fully than ever be fore Its Individuality us a eopiratc state. The new era Is appropriately marked by the title which Its king has chosen. By taking the name Haakon the sovereign rc- j vivos memories of the old epoch when Nor' way last existed as a distinct state. : Haakon VI, whose marriage with the fn- mous Margaret of Denmark led directly to 1 the Danish connection under the Kalmor union, was the last king to rule over a , scpnrate Norway. Now another Haakon ' ascends the Norwegian throne to rule over i a countrv which is Similarly independent. ! but which hns long ago eagerly adopted all of the element of morlern life. The Hnakons of the past gave to Norwegian history some of Its most revered and fa mous name. The young king who now rules over Norway can, like his queen, trace back his lineage to the ancient kings: and on every . grounu, wnntner or i history or policy, he has a firm position to say the least. King Haakon VII and Queen Maud, who are changing- the somewhat retired life to which they have been accustomed fnr the many varying duties of a monarch and his consort have already made themselves much beloved among thosn who have been lucky enough to be counted among their Intimate acquaintances.

The rich, it Is further declared, have already taken earning and are converting their property and securities Into gold and are sending 'l"1"! abroad.

Congressman Norrls of the Fifth district made an exceedingly forcible speech today on the question of federal control of Insur ance and was accorded marked attention from both sides of the chamber. Aa a law yer Judge Norris argued the question of federal and state control. He contended that the only way to govern Insurance com panies was by national supervision, but aa the president's message questioned the right of congress to legislate on this question without a constitutional amendment he wanted that portion of the president's mes sage referring to Insurance sent to the com mittee on Judiciary for a report on the con stitutional right of congress to legislate. Should the Judiciary committee find that congress has not the power to legislate, then he wanted a constitutional amendment j passed at once and submitted tn the states ! for ratification so that the present ecn- ' ress could enact a law that would plaoe Insurance companies under federal control. Norrls argued that every man who had In vestigated tho question of federal super-. vision had doubts as to the Jurisdiction of congress to legislate at this time, a doubt which the president clearly enunciated la his last message. , Cattlemen Call on Wilson.
