THUKSDAY, DECEMBER 15,1898. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President McKinley's annual message has received at the hands of the press, generally, a most favorable comment. It has been pronounced very modest, even compared with other messages of the Pres? ident. To the average reader it has ap? peared as a business-like statement of im? portant events that have occurred during the present year, and a brief reference to our national affairs generally. There has been a disposition with a few papers, like the New York Herald, to make unfavora? ble criticisms upon the message. That paper in speaking of it say?: "True to bis habit ol thiowing down the reins, Presi? dent McKiniey in this inspiring moment of our history has nothing to suggest, takes no initiative, strikes the keynote of no new policy, he merely collate? a dreary rep ?rl presenting numerous facts, and leaves the rest to Congress arid to God." L'pon the whole the message has been received by the public as a patriotic de? claration of the views of our Chief Magis? trate and will be able to win the beany approval of the mass of the people. It was wise in President McKinley to avoid announcing at this time any policy in re gard to the Philippine Islands, before the treaty with Spain had been signed by the Peace Commission, now sitting at Paris and before the ratification of that treaty by the Senate. The suggestion of a policy by the President at this time would be premature and Injudicious. When th< islands have become ours in fact and :i treaty is ratified there can be no doubl that Mr. McKinley will give expression to his views in the usual decided manner in which he has expressed himself upon every important question that has arise| during his administration. At the begin ing of his administration, when he gavt bis views on the Cuban question, he wa> criticised by the opposition press and poli? ticians, who declared that he did not have any decided convictions upon Ilia: question, or was afraid to express them, His caution and conservatism were pro? nounced by hostile Democracy, cowardice The sequel, however, showed that Mr. McKinley not only held positive convic? tions but when the time ca:ne and neces Bity demanded he could express and exe? cute his views. So will it be in cornier tion with the Philippine question. The people have seen enough of Mr. McKinley to have complete faith in his intelligence courage and patriotism, and w?fnphoh him in every step he takes for the advance ment and progress of the nation. It i: most gratifying to note that the President in his message gives an uneijualitied en dorsement and approval to sound money In this position he will be sustained noi only by those who elected him President in 1896 but by many others who did not agree with him in his views that year. 

WILL THEY SUGGEST SOMETHING ? The Democratic newepapeis are making themselves ridiculous by decrying the President's policy in connection with tin Philippines before he has announced what that policy will be. They are striking at what they are pleased to call "imperial ism," but which is in truth territorial ex? pansion. Even if the Administration has determined that the Philippines shall be held as conquered territory, what better policy have the anli-annexationists to sug? gest? They are prolific in criticisms of the supposed policy of the Administration,but seem unwillingly or unable to offer any? thing that will be acceptable or reasonable as a substitute. In. dealing with the Philippine question this country will be compelled to choose between four distinct policies. The first, is to restore the islands to Spain, which would be infamous; the Eecond,is to aban? don them to the natives to he followed by prolonged cru.;l internercine strife, which would be brutal; the third, to turn them over to other Powers for their supervision and to accomplish the work which our people set out to do, which would be cowardly; or to hold the islands, giving to them a teiritorial or colonial government and preparing them for the independent form of government that maybe desired in the future, which would be wise and honorable. If the anti-expansionists have any policy to offer that is better than that whbh they claim is to be pursued by the Adminis tration, why do they not make it known? They should do so.or shut up. A few months ago the Democratic news? papers said that John Sherman was an imbe? cile and it was shameful for Mr. McKinley to make him a member of his Cabinet. Now Mr. Sherman has pronounced against the President's Philippine policy the Democratic journals treat him ss a pro? found statesman and highly qualified to speak upon the foreign policy of the Uuited States. 

SOMETHING MORE THAN AMBITION. Hon. John Sherman said. "I sympa? thize with Agninaldo in his ambition to found a republic in the China Sea, near the equator, and hope be may become the Washington of a new nation, abso? lutely free from European and American influence." Mr. Sherman seems to foisiet that it takes something besides ambition to make a Washington. Aiming the essentials for such a character as that of Wash? ington are courage, extraordinary good sense, sublime patriotism and abso? lute .honesty. There can be no doubt that Aguinaldo has the ambition. We doubt whether he Las the courage, good sense and true patriotism. If report be true he is not honest, for he was bribed by Spain to leave bis native land, then le turned with the American lleet to help organize a rebellion be bud been bribed to abandon. Mr. Sherman shows that he has no just conception of the true situa? tion in the Philippines, when be suggests \ that there is a remote possibility of Agu naido developing a character anything like that of our grand George Washington. Thebe is every indication that there will be a row in the Democratic camp over the question of who shali be the leader ofthat party in the next Congress. It looks like Bailey, of Texas, will be selected for the leadership, which ?ill afford a pic nie for Tom Reed and the Republicans of the House. Americals for Peace, and Can Fight for It. ! .St. Louis Globe Democrat.] Peace is the normal condition of the United States. This country believes in international courtesy, fairness and open i dealing, not in the diplomacy of furtive ! cunning and sinister stratagems. Ameri cans are as direct in war as in other du? ties that devolve upon them. Our army at Santiago pushed .at once to the front and tried cunclui-ions with rifles. Admi? ral Dewey detied torpedoes and forts and as soon as it was light enough engaged the enemy".- lleet in its chosen position. The troops at Manila took the enemy's works by assault. The ships nearest Cervera's lleet when it came out of the harbor did not wait for a massed formation, but at ? tacked singly on the shortest lines. What ! the French official characterizes as a lack of manners turns out on examination to be straightforwardness, a decisive purpose wiien tiie time comes to act. Yet it is the earnest desire of the American people to be at jier.ee with the world, to deal with all frankly and honeslly, to avoid rashness or w.mton aggression, and to keep out ol ^vooked diplomacy, for which they have JMthcr liking nor adaptiveness.
