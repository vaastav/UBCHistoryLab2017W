FOKEHiN DELATIONS. It is gratifving to announce that the relations of the United States with all loreiirn ttowers continue to lie frinmllv Our position after nearlv a centurv ,f successiiii constitutional government, maintenance of good fadh in all of our engagements, the avoidance of compli cations with other nations. and consist ent and amicable attitude toward the strong and weak alike, furnish proof of a poli deal disposition which renders professions of good will unnecessary. There are no questions of d.tiicn'lt pending with any foreign government. (Question has arisen with the govern ment ot Austro-lliingai y touching the representation of the United States at .eiiiui. Having, under mv constitu tional prerogative, appointed an esti mable ciltzcn ot unnnpeaclied probi'v and competence as minis er at that court, the government of Attstro-llun-gary invited this government to cogni zance of certain exceptions, based upon allegations against he personal accept ability of Mr Keilev. the appointed envoy, asking that, in 'view thereof, the point ment should be withdrawn. The reasons advanced were such as ould not be acquiesced in without vio lation of my o:iili of office and the pre- cep.s ot the constitution, since they necessarily involved a limitation in liivor of a foreign government upon the right of selection by the executive and requited such an application of a religious lest as a qualilicalion tor of fice under Ihe United States as would have resulted m the practical dis franchisement of a hu ge class of our citizens and the abandonment of a vital princ pie of our government. The Atistio-IIungarian government finally decided not to receive Mr. Keiley as the envoy of the United States, and that gentleman litis since resigned his ci -in miss on, leaving the post vacant.

The privilege and franchise of Amer ican citizensiif stiouni tie grauieu with care and extended to those only who intend in good faith to assume us duties and responsibilities when at taining its pr.viitges. It should be withheld from those who merely go ihroncrh ihe forms of naluralszat ion wi. n intent of escaping dtr tes with their original allegiance, without taking up on themselves those of the new status, or who mav acmiire the rights of American citiz- nsinp tor no o tier than a hnstiip, niiroose toward their original Government.

The fact tha' our revenues are m ex cess of the actual needs of an ec nom- icul Hdministra ion of the (ioveinment just ties a redu- tiou in the amount ex acted from the people for its support. Our Government is but .he means es tablished by the will of a free people bv which certain principles are ap plied whi'-h thev have adopted for their benefit and projection. And it is never bet er administered and its true sp rit is never belter observed than When ;he peo le's taxation lor its support is scrupulously limited to the actual necessities of expenditures and iiis ribmed according io a jusl and equitable plan. The proposition with which we have to deal is the reduc ion of the revenue received by the Government and indi rectly paid 1 y the people from custom duties. The ques ion of free trade is not in volved, nor is there now any occasion tor the general d.scussion o' the wis dom or expediency of a protective sys tem. Justice aii 1 fairness indica e that in any modification of our pres ent laws relating to revenue, the in dus'ries and in; erests which have been encouraged by such laws. and in which our citizens have larire investments, should not be ruthlessly injured or de stroyed. YVe should also deal with the subject in such m nner as to protect the in terests of American labor, which is the capital of our workinnmen. Its stability and proper remuneration fur nish the most just fiabte pretex for a pro ective policy. Wi bin these limi tations a certain reduction should be made in our customs revenue. The amount of such reduction having been determined, the inquiry follows: Where can it best be remitted, and what articles can best be released from du y in the interest of our citi zens? I think the reduction should be made in the revenue derived .rom a lax up on the imported necessaries of life. We thus directly lessen tne cost or -.vino: in every tamiiy ot tne lanu, ana release to the public in every humbl home a lamer measure ot me rewarus of frugal nidus ry. TIIK S1LVKK QUESTION. During the vear ended Xov. 1, 1SS5, 145 nat ional banks were organized, with an aggregate cap.tal of $H 948 000. and circulating notes have been issued to them amounting to f 4 .274.910. Ihe whole number of these banks in exist ence on the day named was 2.727. The verv limited 'amount of circulating notes issued by our national banks compared w.th the amount the law per mits mem to issue upon a ueposit ui bonds for their redemption, indicates that the volume of our circulating medium mav be largely increased through this instrumentality. .N'otu- iiig more important lhan the present condition of our currency and coinage can claim your attention. Since Feb ruary. 1S7S. the government has. unaer the compulsory provisions or law. pur chased stiver bullion and coined the same at the rate of more than 5-.000.- 0U0 everv month. JLsy tins process, up to the present date 21o,7 !) 431 s lver dollars have been coined. Every month S.-2 iKHt.o- 0 of crold in the public treasury is paid out for two mi I on or more of silver dollars to oe atmea 10 me iu.e mass already accumulated, it con tinned Ions e'nough this operation Will result in the substitution of silver lor all the gold the government owns ap- niic.itiie to its trenerai purposes. will nnr ilo to rely nnoll the receipts of the government to make good this dram of gold, Because tue silver iuus coined having lieen made legal tender for all debts and dues, puouc ana pri vate, at times during the last six months 08 per cent of the receipsfor duties have lieen in siver or Silver cer tificates, wh le the average within that tieriod haa been 21 ner cent. The nrooortion of silver and its cer tificates rece ved by the government w.ll nrohab v increase as time goes on for the reason that the nearer the nueii-arl nrmroMr h. when it Will be obl ged to offer silver in payment of iLs oblitaitions the greater inducement 1 hern will ti. tn hoard eold agiiinst de preciation in the value of silver, or for trifl TKurnosa or soeeuuuuig. lionrrfint of cold has already begun When t!i time comes that cold has been withdrawn from circulation, them will be apparent thed fference between the real value of the silver dollars and the dollar in gold, and the two coins w.ii part eomnanv. a-oiu. plui standard of value and necessary in our .iinlinTa with oilier countries, will be at a "premium over silver.

The president goes on to mention ' our participation in the conference of the Latin union, and refers to the fail- i ure of that effort. He recounts send- 1 ing a delegate to look into the financial j condition of Europe, and says that the attitude of the leading European coun tries has not been change 1 oh linancial subjects since issi and that these views are supported by public opinion. He , then says: j The steps thus taken have therefore only more fully demonstrated the use lessness of further attempts at present ' to arrive at any agreement on the sub- ject with other nat.ons. The condition in which our treasury may lie placed ; by a persistence in our present course is a matter of concern to every patriotic citizen who does not desire his govern ment to pav in Silver such of its obi - ca tions as should be pa.d in gold. iXor should our condition lie such as to obl.ge us. in a prudent management of our affairs, to discontinue ihe calling j in and payment of interest bearing j obligations which we have the right ' now To discharge and thus avoid the,' payment of further interest thereon, j That disaster has not already overtaken us furnishes no proof that danger does not wait upon a continuation of the present silver coinage. I recommend tiie suspension of compulsory co.nage of silver dollars, directed by" the law passed in Eebruary, 157S. THE 

LIFE SAVING SERVICE. The most gratify ng results have at tended the operations of the life saving service during the hist fiscal year. The observance of the provision "of law re quiring the appointments of the force employed in the service to be made "solely with reference to the:r fitness, and without reference to their political or party afliliat.on," has secured the re sult which may confidently be expected in any branch of public" emplownent where such a rule is applied. "As a consequence this service is composed of men well qualified for the perform ance of their dangerous and exception ally important duties. The number of stations in commis sion at the close of the year was 2 3. The number of disasters to vessels and crafts of all kind within thcr held of act on was 371. Tne number of ner- sons endangered in such disasters was ' 5 4::ft nf whom o too ,-. .,,,,1 ! only eleven lost. Other lives which : were imperiled, though not bv d s- asters to shipping, were also rescued, and a large amount of property was saved through the aid of this serv.ee. The cost of ts maintenance during the year was SS2S.47 1.4:1. TIIH AU5IY, The report of the Secretary of War is herewith submitted. The attention of Congress is invited to the detailed account which it contains of the ad ministration of his department and his recommendations and suggestion for the improvement of tue service. The army consisted, at the date of the last consolidated returns, of 2 lo-l officers, and 24.7-0 enlisted men. The expenses of the departments for the fiscal year ending June 3 . 1SS5, in cluding S13.1b4.34.Gd for public works and river and harbor improvements, were T5.S-5 I.9D9.54. lieside the troops which were dis patched in pursuit of the small band of Indians who left their rescrvat on in Arizona and committed murders and outrages, two regiments of cavalry and one of infantry were sent hist July to the Indian Territory to prevent an out break which seemed imminent. They remained to aid, if necessary, in the expulsion of intruders upon the reser vation, who seemed to have caused the discontent among the Indians, but the executive proclamation warning them to remove was complied with without in erference. Troops were nlso sent to Rock Springs, in Wyoming Territory, after the massacre ot Ch nese thereto pre vent further disturbances, and after ward to Seattle, iu Washington Terri tory, to avert a threatened attack upon Chinese laborers and domestic violence there. In both cases, the mere pres ence of the troops had the desired effect. It appears that the number of deser tions litis diminished, but thatdnrng the last fiscal year they numbered 2 027, and one instance is given by the JL.eu tenant General of s;x desertions by the same recruit. I am convinced that this number of desert ons can be much d nnnished by better disc phne and treatment, but tiie punishment should lie increased for reiieated offenses. These desertions might also be reduced bv lessening the term of lirst enlist- ; ....... O,,, -11,.,,-i,,,, r. .li.,...,l..,,r...l I ill.

After one term of service, a re-enlistment would be quite apt to secure a contented recruit and good soldier. ! The acting Judge Advocate General reports that the number of trials by general courts-martial during the year, 1 was 2 328. and that 1.851 trials took place belore garrison and regimental courts-martial. The suggest. on that probably more than half the army has been tr.ed for offenses great and small. in one year, mav weiltirrest attention. Of course, many of these trials before garrison and regimental courts-martial were for offenses almost frivolous, and there should, I think, lie a way devised ' to dispose of these in a more summary '. and less inconvenient manner than by j court-martial. If some of the pro- ceedings of courts-martial which I j have naa occasion to examine, present the ideas of justice which generally prevail in these tribunals. I am satis fied that they should be much re formed, if the honor and the honesty of the array and navv are bv their in strumentality to be vindicated and pro tected. 

SIGNAL 8'TtVICE. The work of the Signal Service has been prosecuted during the last yeif with results of increasing lienefits to the country. The field of instruction has been enlarged With a view of ad ding to its usefulness. The number of stations in operation June 30. 1885, was 4S9. Telegraphic reports are re ceived daily Irom 110 stations. Re ports ar,e also received from 7o Cana dian stations, 375 volunteer observers, 52 army surgeons at military posts, and 333 foreign stations. The expense of service during the fiscal vear. alter de ducting receipts from military tele graph lines, was 797.592.97. In view of the fact referred to by the Secretary ot ar. that tne work ot tins service ordinarily is of a scientific nature, and the further fact that it is assuming large proportions constantly, and be tantlv. and be- coming more and more unsuited to the fixed rules wh en must govern the army, I am inclined to agree with him in the opinion that it snot 1 be sepa rately established. If this a done the scope and extent of its operations should, as nearly as possible, be defi nitely prescribed by law. and always capaiiie or exact ascertainment. NAVAL AFFAIKS.

POSTAL SEUVICE. The affairs of the postal service are ex hibited bv the report of the Postmaster General, which will be laid before you. The postal revenue, whose ra es of gain up u the rising prosperity of island out stripped the increas-iiig exi'nse of our prowing service, was checked by the reduc tion in the rate of letter postage, which took effect with the beginning of O.'tober In ihe Lit er year, and it diminished during the two past liscal year Si,7!"i(M) in the proportion tu j.-',7ii,(XW in lssi to S t0.(X I in 1Sn5. Natural growth and development have, in tne meantime, increased expendi ture, result ing in a deficiency in the rev enue to the expenses of the ilepirtinent of five and a qu.irter millions for the year ss3, and eignt and one-third milli .ns in the last tisc.d year. The anticipated and natur d revival of the revenue has !een op- pressed and retarded by the unfavorable business condition of the country, of which :.,o- r 'V " iT... ' " i! . ".U!T- !? a"""J"S ...u.ic .sii.r,,ii, iiunrtii, .v 111U report t.iat our retanling prosperity is marked by a gain of :so,ih.io in the revenue of the l itter half of the last year over the corr. sponding period of the preceding year. The change in the weight of first class niiitiei which may be carried for a single ruie of postage, from a half ounce to an ounce. ;uid the reduction by one- mil of the rule of newspaper postage, which, un der recent legislation begun Willi the cur rent yenr. will operate to restrain the ring mentation of receipts which otherwise might h ive been expin'ted to such a degree th in tiie scale of ex cuse may gain upon ttie revenue and cause an increased defi ciency to be shown at its close; yet after no long period of rewe.ikened prosperity, by proper economy, it is confi lently antici pated that event In present low rites now as favorable as any country affords, wi I be adequate to sustain the cost of the ser vice. The operation of the Tost Office Depar' nient is for the convenience and benefit of the peop e, and the method by winch they pav the charges of this usefiti arm of their public service, so that it lie just and impar tial, is of less importance to them than the economical expenditure of the means they provide for its maintenance and the due improvement of its a g -11c ics, so that they may enjoy its highe-t usefulness. A proper attention has be 11 directed lo the preven tiyii of wus:e r extravagance, and good re sults appe.ir from the rcitorts to have al ready been accomplished. 

DOMESTIC MON'F.Y ORDERS. I appro. e the recommendation of the Postmaster (.eral to reduce the charges on domestic money orders of S" and less from to 5 cents. This change will mater ially aid those of our people who, most of all, "avail themselves of this instrumental ity, but to whom the eleme.it of cheapness is of the greatest importance. With this reduction the system would still remain self-siii'porting. THE F It II E PF.I.IV T!T SYS F.M has been extended to nin teen additional cities during the year, and l.S now enjoy its conveniences. Experience has commended it to those who enjoy its benefits, and fur ther enlargement of its facilities is due to o her CDi111111mii.es to which it is ad ipted. In the cities where it has been estab ished, taken together, the local wistageevceeds its maintenance bv nearly Si, Hi 0.000. Tne limii to whicn tins system is now confi ed by law has been nearly reached, and the reasons given justify its ext.-nsiou, which is proposed. F 'RI'.IGX MAIL SERVICE. It was decide I, with my approbation after a sufli lent exminiation, to he inexpe dient for the Post Oltice 1) partment to con tract for carrying our foreign iiiuiis tinier the additional auihority giv -a by the hist Congress. The amount limit 'd was inad equate to pay aii w ithin the purview of the law t e full rate of -VI cents per mile, and it would have been unjust and unwise to have given it to some and denied it to others. Nor could contracts have been let under the law to all at a rate to have brought tne aggregate within theappropria tioti without such practical pre-ic raugemeut of terms as would have violated it. The rate of sea and inland postage, which was pr ffered under another statute clearly ap pears to lie a fair compensation for the de sired service, being three times the price necess iry to secure tnuispor ation by other vesse.s upon any route, and much beyond the charges made to private persons tor services not less burdensome. Some of the steamship comp inies, uihii the refusal of tlip Postniiis er General to a tempt, by the means provided, the distrihntioji of the sum appropriated, an extra compensation, with drew the services of their vess 'Is, and thereby occasioned slight inconvenience, though no considerable injury. Tue mails have been dispatched by other means. Whatever may be thought of the policy of subsidizing any line of public conveyance or travel. I am satisfied that it Simula not be done under cover of an expenditure i -cideut to th" administration of a depart ment, nor should there lie any uncertainty as to the recipients of the subsidy or any discretion left to an executive otiicer as to its distribution, if such gifts of puolic money are to be made for tiie purpose of aiding any enterprise in the supposed In terest of the puolic, 1 can not hut think that the amount to tie paid and the beuetici.iry might better be det-rmiued by Congress thau in any other way.- DKPAItTMKST OF JUSTIC?.. The rejiort of the Attorney General con tains a history ot the conduct of the De partment of Justice during the last year, and a 11 11 in tier of valuable suggestions as to needed legislation, and 1 invite your careful attention to the sime, 'i he condition of business iu the courts of the United States is such that there seems to lie an imjierative necessity for remedial legislation on the subject Some of thes courts are so over bui'iiened wi.li pending causes that the de lays on determining litigation amount often to a denial of justice. Among the plans suggested for relief is one suhmitted by the At ornev General. Its main features are the transfer of all or.gmal jnnsiictiou of i the Circuit Courts to the District Courts i and an increase of Judges for the latter where necessary; an addition of Judges to the Circuit Courts and co, stunting iheni exclusively courts of at -peal and reasonably limiting apeais thereto; further restric tions ot the right to rein ve causes from the State to Federal courts; permitting ap- rea s to the Supreme t.ourt irom, the courts of the District of Columbia mid tiie Territories only in the same cast's as they are allowed from State courts, and gu ird in r against mi unnecessary uuintier of ap peals from the Circuit Courts.

Among In dians u ion these several reservations there exists me most m irKed d if -rence in natu ral traits and disiiositioii, and in their prog ress toward c.vi izaiion. Wuile somj are lazy, virions and stupid, ot iters are indus trious, peaceful and intelligent. While a portion of them are self-supporting aud in dependent and have so far advanced in Civiiiz.n, on t.iat t. icy may in ike their own laws administered through oflicers of their own choice, and educate their children in schools of their own establishment and maintenance, others still remain 111 squalor and dependanct, elm 1st the savagery of their natural state. In dealing with this question the desires manifested by the In dian's should not be ignore I. H -re again we find a great diversity. With some the tribal relaiion is ch risued with the u, most tenacity, whi;e its hold up n others iscou sideraoly relaxed. Tne love of home is strong with ail, and yet there are those whose attachment to a" particular locality is by no means unyielding. Tue ownership of the.r lands in severa ity is much desired by some, w.nle by others and soinetim s th' most c.viiized. suci auisiriimtion would be bitteriy opixis al. T.ie variation of their wants growing oitt of and connected with the character of their several locations, should bi. regtrdi'd. 3 nine are upon reser vations 1111st tit for grazing, b.it without flocks or herds, and s.'in 1 on arable laud have no agficu.tu aal miplemeius, whib some of the reservations are double the s ze necessary to maintain tlu; number of In dians now upon tliein. In a few cas 's, per hatis, tuey sm.uUI be enlarged. Add to all tins the differeiiee in the administration of the agencies. While the same duties are devolved upon ail, the disposition of the agents ami the mannerof tiieircontaet with the Indians have much to do with their con dition and welfare. The agent who peri'unctioiiarily perforins his duty and sioilifu.ly neglec.s all oppor tunity io advance tneir mural and physical improvement, an 1 tails to inspire t .1111 with a desire ior belter things, win aceo up i-.li nothing in thedirec.ion of tued civil. zaiion, while he who feels the burden of an impor tant trust and has an interest iu his work wib, by constant example, lii in, yet con siderate treatm nt, and well directed aid a. id enc itirag. ni.-nt, constantly lead those under iiis charge tow ird the light of taeir entranciHseineiit.

RAILKOAP UNI) GRANTS ASD SL'USIPIES. The Nation has made princely grants and subsidies to a system of railroads projected ns great national highways to connect the r cine states wi lithe t. 1st. it has been charged that Ihese don 1 1 ions from the eo- ple have leeti diverted to private cam and corrupt u-es, and thus publ c indignation has been aroused, and suspicion engen dered. Our great ation does not begrudge Its generosity, but it abhors pecul ation and fraud, and the favorab e regard of our peo ple tor the great eoriiorations to which these grants were made can only be revived by a restoration of confidence, 10 be secured by tlhir constant, unequivocal and deary manife-ted integrity. A faithful app icit Hon of the unit iniiiished pr cceds of the grants to tlieconstriK-t on ami perfecting of their roads, an honest discharge 01 their ob ligations and entire lust ice .0 all tiie people in the enjoyment of their rigits on these highways ot travel, is all the public asks. and it will be content with no less. Io se- cur- these things should be the common purpose of th otlicers of the Government, as well as of the corporations. With this accomp' ished, prosperity would be perma nently secured to the roads and national pride wou.d take the place of national com- piainL PEXSI0X9.

In the Territory of J an. the law of the United St tes pissed for the surpressiou of polygamy has peen energetically did laitli fully executed dining the past year, with measureahl jcooil results. A number of convictions have been secured for un, awful cohabitation, and in some cas s pleas of guilty have been entered and sbght jsin lshineut imposed tpiou prom se by the ac cused that they would not again offend against the law,"nor advise, counsel, aid or aliot iu any w ay its viol dion by others. The Utah Commissione s express "the opinion, based uikjii such inform at 10:1 as they may be idile 10 obta 11, that but few polyg inous marriages h ive taken place in tne Terr tory during the last year, i'hey further reimrt that, while there can 110 be found 11 on the registration lists of v ders the name of a man actually guiby of polygon.-, and w.iile none of that ' lass are lolning olliee, yet, at the last election in the J'eiri.ory, all the of ficers elected except in one county were men who, though not actually living in practice of p .lyg.iniy, subscribe to the doc trine of polygamous marriages as a divine revelaiion and a law unto a. L higher and more binding upon thecou-cience than any human law, local or national. This is the strong spectacle presented by a (immunity prot"cted by a republican form of govern mmt to which they owe allegiance, -us-t.tining by their suffrages a princi ie and a belief which sets at nan in that oh i git ion of absolute w iedience to the laud whicn lies at the foundation of republican institutions. The strength, the ix'ipetuiiy and tiie des i ny of the Nation rests upon our homes ev tablislied by the law of G mI. guarded by fiarental care, regulated by paren.al authof ty and sanctified by parental love. Th"se are not the homes of polygamy. The mo hers of our land who ruie the Nation as they would ti e characters, and guide the actions o their sous, live according lo God's holy ordinance, and each, pure and happy In tne exclusive ove of th father of tier children, shells the warm light of true wo manhood, uiiperv rted and unpolluted. u on ab within her pure and who esome fami ly circie. These are not the cheer ess, crushed and u iwomiin y mothers of po y ga my. The faih rs of our fannies are ihe tj-st citi ens of the K-pub ic; wife aud children are the sources of patriotism, and co -jugal and parental atfec.101 beget dev -tion to country. The man who. u ideti el with plural marriage, is - unbounded in his Sin '. e home with his wife and ciu oren, h a stake in the country inch inspires him with resect for its laws and courage for the defense. These ar" not the fa. hers of po y gabions f 1111 lies. There is no feature of this practice or the system which sanc tions it, which is not opposed to all that is of va ue in our institutions. There shou d be no re ax i'ion in the firm but Just execution of the law now in opera tion, and I shou d fie e ad to approve such further d screet icgis alio 1 as wd rid this country of this o ot U)Kn its fair fame. Since the people upholding polyg amy in our Ten Stories are rcint'op'ed by immigration from other I ids 1 r-ecommend that a law be p ssed to prevent the impor.a.ion of Mormons in o the cou dry. civu.-servi.se reform. The report of the Civil-service commission, which will be subinituil. contains an account of the manner in w inch the Civii-service law has been executed during the last year and much valuable information on this impor tant subject. I am inclined to think that there is no sentiment more genertl in the minds ot the i-eople of our country than a conviction of the correi-tness of the princi ples upon which the law entoreing civil-service retorm is bas.iL In its present condi tion tiie law regulates only part of tiie subor dinate public positions throughout the ui tr'.

THE 

OOVESMEST I.tUHART. lt Is a source of considerable and not un natural discontent that no adequate provi sion has yet been made for the a, comui".i tion of the principal library of tne Govern ment. Of the vast collection of looks and pamphlet gathered at the I'apitol, number ing some 700,000 volumes exc usive of manu scripts, map.-, an. 1 the products of thegraphio arts, also ot great volume and value, only almut 300,000 volumes, or less than half the collection, are provided with shelf room. The others, which are increasing at the rate of from 25.000 to 30,000 volumes a year, are not only unaccessible to the public, tint are subject to serious damage and deterioration from other causes in their present situation. A consideration of the fact that the library of the Capitol has twice been destroyed or damaged by tire, its daily increasing value and its importance as a place of deposit of books miller the law refuting Io copyright, make manifest the necessity of prompt act ion to ensure its proper accommodation and protection. 

DISTRICT MATTERS. My attention has Ikhmi eallcd to a contro versy which has arisen form the condition of law relating lo railroad facilities in the city of Washington, which has involved the commissioners of the District, iu much an noyance and trouble. 1 hope the difficulty will tie promptly settled by appropriate leg islation. The tlommissioncrs represent that enough of the revenues of the . strict are now on deposit in the Treasury of the United Sta es, to repay the stun advanced by the Government tor sewer improvements, under the act of June SO. lsst. They desire now an advance oftlie share which ultimately should be borne by the District of the cost of extensive improvements, to the streets of the city. The total e-nse. of these contern- Sbited improvements is estim ited at S1.000, K). and tuey are ot tiie oniinou that a con siderable suiu could be saved if they had all the money in hard, so that contracts for work could be made at the same time. They express coiiiiilenee that, if the adviuice ask ed for should be made, the Government would be reimbursed the same within a rea. suitable time. I have no doubt that these improvements could be made much cheaper if undertaken together and prosecuted ac cording to a general plan. The License law now in force within the District is deficient and uncertain in some of its provisions, and ought to lie amended. The Commissioners urge with good reason the necessity of providing a building for tho use of the District Government which shall better secure the saiety and preservation of its valuable books and records.

(.ROVER Cl.EVKLAJ.Ia, iA-SHINOTON. D C-lll er lcoi. A No Need of a Quarrel- There seems to he some apprehension among some Democrats, as there is a vivid hope among Republicans, that a conflict will be "precipitated" somehow or otocr between the President and his party during the next Congress. The prophets of evil think, or pretend to think, that the irritat on against the President, of w hich there are sporadic local symptoms, will break out virulent ly when the floodgates of talk i6 opened at Washington next month. Now, of course nobody can tell what the President may do or what Congress may do; but it should be borne in mind that love for competitive ex." ruinations, unsatisfactory distribution 0" offices and delay in distributing them are the only causes ol offence yet manifest in Mr. Cleveland. None of these things is matter for the Democrats in Congress to make a rov almut. The conieiitive examinations are prescribed by a Ktatute which cannot now be repealed, and the delay may be a little disappointing, but sooner or later, and on the whole pretty soon, tbe offices will be in Democratic hanC.s; and as to the appointments already made, it is absurd to suppose that ai-ybody hut the Republicans wants to be disagreeable aliout tl em Take out a few Mugwump appointments, given for supiosed value received, and Mr. CI veland's appointments have been Democratic. In a few notable instances the party would have preferred other DtMiiocrats than those he selected, but s long as the President HpiM.ints Demo crats, and not Republicans, his party is not going to quarrel 'ith him. That he has stepped 011 the toes of a number of Congressmen is very prfthahie, but Con gressmen with sore toes will keep them to themselves if the have any sense of propriety. Tbis mattir of the offices, important as it is. is after all, a minor one. The Democratic party has to intention and the Democrats in the Forty ninth Con gress can have no intention of quairel ling with the President aliout offices. The Repuilicans have the patent fol doing that sort of thing.
