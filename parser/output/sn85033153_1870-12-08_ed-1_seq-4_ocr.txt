Wit Svibunc. PBESIDKXT'S MESSAGE. The President’s Message might be much shorter without much injury to the writer or to the nation. It contains much which will meet strong opposition, especially the repeated recommendation of annexing San Domingo. The Pres ident is as fully satisfied with the dis graceful conduct of the “protector,” Mr. Washburn at the expulsion of some 80,000 Germans from Franco without even a protest, as he is with the recog nition of the “Mob Republic” in Paris at the receipt of a single telegram. The President’s pionositioa con cerning Alabama question, is very proper, and if carried out, will bring on an early settle ment ; for bis strong remarks in regard to Canada he has not sufficient cause. The best part of the message is con tained in the Presidents remarks on “revenue reform” and on the reform in public offices. Taken as a whole, the message contains much material, many good suggestions and propositions and surpasses by far in its diction and in its whole attitude the first j’ears message of President Grant. 

TAXATION AND REVESCE. In the report of air. Delano, Commis sioner of Internal Revenue, he gives the comparative figures of the collections cf revenue euring the last eighteen months of Andrew Johnson’s administration,and the first eighteen months under Grant. The tables compare as follows : From Svpf. 1, From March 1 1867, to Feb, ISG9 to Aug. 28.1860. 31,1870. $241,5-0,760 $291,492,827 This shows an increase of revenue to the amount of §-19,072,041. But, in the latter eighteen months, taxes, which had yielded $52,216,010 had been repealed, showing a total gain in the collection ex ceeding $100,000,000. This result estab lishes the two facts, that an honest col lection of the taxes is but justice to those who pay them, and that’a reduction of the rate, and of the number of objects of taxation does not involve a loss of revenue. In Johnson’s time, the tax on whiskey was $2 per gallon, and, during the eigh teen months covered by this estimate, $41,678,000 were collected from spirits. During the’second eighteen months, the specific tax was 50 cents per gallon, and the revenue collected was $82,477,000. The rate of tax on tobacco was also large ly reduced, and the revenue therefrom increased from $29,327,000 to §40,504,- 000. lot there was not a gallon more spirits, nor a pound more of tobacco sold during the one period than there was in the other. The repeal of the taxes on other articles which yield $52,000,000, in no way di minished the revet uc, yet it was a great boon to the people. HUME. The coil of the Pru sian army is slowly tightening around the Ton mine. A heavy force is gradually moving down to ward the valley of the Loire, nowhere seriously resisted t>y the French. The dispatches report a body of 8,000 Ger mans at Chateau Regnault on the 28th, not more than a half-day’s march north of the scat of Government. The vast wave is spread all over the Departments of the Sarthe, the Loire and Cher. They are reported as occupying in force the towns of Mainers and St. Calais to La Chartre and Chateau Regnault, a dis tance ot sixty miles. At right angles to this gicat line runs another of about equal length trom Cha'eaudum to Mon tugis. nearly due cast and west, only about twelve miles north of the city of Or' leans. At the extreme left of this line the veteran army of Prince Frederick Cher.es lies massed, in apparent inactiv ity, contenting itself with occasionally feeling the force of Gen. Puladines, and easily repulsing all his attacks. As we have before shown, the present purpose of this force is merely to detain the army of the Loire where it is, while the army of the Duke of Mecklenburg pursues its advance southward upon Tours.— Meantime, the forces of Man tea lie 1 are making clean work in toe extreme north, •weeping through Picardy, capturing Amicus and defeating the army of Gen. Farrc in two engagements. The ganison of Paris, growing restive in their enforced leisure, have been given * breathing by Trochu. They have made a demonstrotion upon Doz ens, a village nine miles north of Ver sailles, where the Rouen railroad crosses the Seine ; and ;.n apparently serious at tack against Choisy le Roi, six mi’es south of Paris on the Orleans road, which resulted in a severe repulse cf the French. Alarming symtems of insubordination are visible among the officers of the Re publican army. Gen. Bourhaki hesitates to take command of the Eighteenth Corps, and Count Keratry has tendered his resignation in a violent and indecor ous letter addressed to the Provisional Government. Keratry is a man of great energy and talent, and has hitherto ex hibited a fortunate faculty of deserting a losing cause at the most advantageous moment. His revolt at this time is per haps more significant as an omen than as an event. —-V F. Tribune. RfTSS^A. —The Eastern question is rap idly subsiding into a matlcr of purely diplomatic interest. It seems probable that a European Congress will soon be held to give another settlement to the claims of Russia, which will hardly stand as long as the last. The Prussian Gov ernment has taken a lively interest in this Compromise; and it is saij that the Cab inet ot Petersburg accepts it in principle. The Sublime Porte regards the whole af fair with characteristic apathy, and no more thinks of actively interfering in the discussion than a patient, sick unto death, would think of dictating a course -of treatment to his physician. 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Washington, Dec. s.—The following is part of the President’s messaee : To the Senate and House of Representa tives : A year of peace and general prosperity to this nation has passed since the last assembling of Congress. We have, through a kind Providence, been blessed with abundant crops and have beer spar ed complications and war with foreign nations. In our midst comparative liars mony has been restored. It is to be re gretted, however, that a free exercise of the elective franchise has by violence and intimidation been denied to citizens in ex ceptional cases, in several of the States lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the people has thereby been reversed. The States of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas have been'restorod to representation in our national councils; Georgia, the only State aow without representation may confiden tially be expected to take her place there also at the beginning of the new year. Then let us hope will be completed the work of reconstruction. 

GENERAL HARMONY AND PROSPERITY With an acquiesence on the part of the whole people in the national obligations to pay the public debt, created as the price of otir Union, the pensions to our disabled soldiers and sailors, and their widows and orphans, and in the changes to the Constitution which have been made necessary by the great rebel lion, there is no reason why we should not advance in material prosperity and happiness as no other nation did, after so protracting and devastating a war. THE WAR IN FRANCE. Soon after the existing war broke out in Europe, the protection of the United States Minister in Paris was invoked in favor of the North German domiciled in French territory. Instructions were issu ed to grant the protection. This has been followed by an extension of Ameri can protection to citizens of Saxony, Hesse and Sax Coburg,Cotben,Columbia, Portugal. Uruguay. The domnician re public, Equador, Chili, Paraguay and Versailles in Paris. The charge was an enormous one, requiring constant and se vere labor as well as the exercise of pa ;ienoe, prudence and good judgment. It has been pci formed to the entire satisfac tion of (his government, and, as I am officially informed, equally so to the sat isfaction of the government of North Ger many. ****** CENTRAL AMERICA. It is the obvious interest, especially of neighboring nations, to provide against injury to those who may have committed high crime? within their borders, and who may have sought refuge abroad. For this purpose extradition treaties have been concluded with several of the Cen tral American republics, and others arc in progress. VENZUELLA. The sense of Congress is desired, as early as may be convenient, upon the pro ceedings of tho Commission on claims against Venzuella, as communicated in the messages of 31 arch 4th, ISC9, March Ist, 1870, and March 31st, 1870. It has not beer, deemed advisable to distribute any of the money which has been receiv ed from that government until Congress shall have acted upon the subject. THE CHINESE MASSACRES. The massacre of French and Russian residents at Toin Tein under circumstan ces of great barbarity were supposed by some to have been premeditated, and to indicate a purpose among the populace to exterminate foreigners in the Chinese empire. The evidence fails to establish such n supposition, but shows a complic ity by the local authorities and the mob. The government at Pekin, however, seems to have been disposed to fulfil its treaty obligations ; so far as it was able to do so. Unfortunately tho news of the war between tho German States and France reached China soon after the mas sacre. It would appear that the popu lar mind became possessed with tho idea that this contest, extending to Chinese waters, would neutralize the Christian in fluence and power, and that the time was coming when the superstitious mass might expel all foreigners and restore mandarin influence- Anticipating troub le from this cause, I invited France and North Germany to make an authorized suspension of hostilities in the East, where they were temporarily suspended by act of the commanders, to act together for the future protection in China of the lives and pro] erty of Americans and Europeans.
