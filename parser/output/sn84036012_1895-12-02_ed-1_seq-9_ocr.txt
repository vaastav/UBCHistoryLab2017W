Wauhingten. Dec. 1.-4rbe Pifty toarth congress will begin its drat see slon in Washington to-day. When its members were chosen, Uhere was a grave question whether they would be called 'together last spring in e*tra orinary session. TBepresideMt did not see 'the neoesity for that. so the rega ht session of the congress is its flAtt session. and the maen who will gather hn the ball of the house of represenat Wmves and the senate chamlber will have waIted 12 months for the exercise of The privileges and powers conferred on them in the election of 1ist No. net all the privileges. The ser seantat-arms has a habit, long estab lished by ocmnon usage, of advancing newly elected members money on :heir salaries aster the 4th of March pro vided there is no contest for their seats. 'lbe pay of mabe and senators be gins March 4 at noon, though neither members nor sen tors are sworn in until the meeting of congress, which may not oocur, as in the present case, until nine months later. In at least one instance, which is a part of the unwritten history of the house, the sergeant-ast-arms advanced money to a member who was contest inc a seat. Mnowing that the contest ant was of 'the same faith as the ma jority of the members of the house and having no doubt that the contest would be decided in his favor from po litioal sympathy, as is 'the common rule. And it is also recorded in the memories of many of the older mem bers that this contest was decided on its merits, and that the sitting mem ber was permitted to keep his sea:, which so complica.ted the accounts of the of cers of the house that a great soandal resulted. Since 'that time no money has been advanced to members until it had been earned, at least con struotively. Constructively a member serves his country from noon of the 4th of March e.dter his election; actual ly the new member in meet cases be gins his work after the first Monday In December. TWhe Pensylvania Avenue Parade. The procession which will move on the capitol by way of Pennsylvan'a avenue Monday morning, Dec. 2, will be remarkable chiefly for the absence ft fauRliar faces. Mar. Reed of Maine will be there, no doilt. He usually walks to the oapl tol because it affords h*.m the only ex emrise he gets during the long legisla tve day, sand even through the term of his spketasttp, so soon to be renewed. his slow, swlnging gait was famil'ar to the pedeartisas on the avenue between 10 and 11 o'clock of every bright morn kwe. His oolleague, Boutelle, just back from Europe, will be another pedestrian flgure. So will The hard-worked D;ng Iey and The earnest, thin-faced Milliken ter the eleotion of 1894 left 'the Maine delegatton kAtact. Dookery of Missouri, cordially hated by the department clerks for his cru sade in favor of the revtislon of the last of govermue nt employee, will be on- of the flw survivors of 'the Missouri con gresional colony. Cobb of St. LIouis, elected in spite of himaelf; the fiery Tanraney of Kania's COty, Hal and DeArmond are all that are lest to Missouri, but Chareles F. Joy of St. Louis, who was unseated by the demooratic house two years ago, will have his revenge as he strolls up tihe avenue, rehearsing the list of men who voted ageinst him and who are now in private liNa "Privete John" Allen of Mississippi, the quaint 'humorist whose fun is never bitter or malicious, and Hernando Money, his colleague, now a shot con testaiet for the senatorship from his state, are both in the new congress, 'bit Money will possibly be at home on Monday, attending 'to his senator Er-Speker Crisp will Join the procee slon at his winter home, the Metropoll tan hotel, headquarters of Sou:hern sta'tesmen, but the Metropolitan nc longer lairbors the oourtly Ramsonm, sc long a menember of the senate, now min later to Mezxoo. Cannon of Illinois, grizied and gray, will pull his slouched hat over his eyes as he turns into the avenue from Fif teen'th street and masets the irays of the mm'nrtng sun. Six years ago be was a dardiedate for speake,- against the aaan who is now the unanim ws thoj-.- of the republican memnbers of the house. Burrows of Midhigan, another of 'the candidates at ahe t poit*toea crisis, is now a senator from the state of Michl gaon, promoted to higher honors at the last session of congress. (bbb of Alabama, beat known as the author of "Where anm I at?" is one of the survivors at the last political revo lution. Hilborn of California. turned out like Joy of Missouri. returns as he did to serve his tfil term 'this rtime. Catch ings of Misslinippi, confident of the administration. is another of the sur vivors. So is Miecreary, ex-governor of Kentucky, but he and Berry are the only membiers of the old delegation left. The face of Breokinridge will be missing. So will many another famil iar face--Bland of Missouri, father of the cart wheel dollar; Holman of In diana. watchdog of the treasury for 30 years: Bourke Cockran, New York's famous campaign orator; Bymn of Nebrpaska. the "boy orator of the Piad'te;" Springer of Illinois, who in troduced the famous anti-third term resolution in the house when Grant was a candidate, and who has been sent to Oklahoma to fill a judge's place side by side with that famous kicker, Kilgore of Texas. Conn of Indiana will not be in the congressional parade, he will eye 1: not enviously from the office of his Washinictun newspaper, for like that other ex-congressman, Beriah Wilkins of Chtio. he has prospered in the field of journalasm at the capital. ilut the list is t ii long. It would fill a mtumn to re-i--x all that have gone and all that still remain. To the stran ger eye perba;s' the pro-ession will te much as it a.'. tw^ yEars ago.

The number of new ftein In the senate chamber when tihe v4ce prest dent calls that body to order will be comparatively few. Mr. Ransom's will be missing. Mr. Butler of South Carolina, another relic of the age of chivalry In -the Bioth, is also gone Into retirement. Georgia sends Auwuetms 0. Bacon to take the seat held for a brief space by Patrick Walsh. the ed4tor of the Augusta Chronicle. J. H. Gear, an old-tim mem ber of the house, best known as "Gov ernor Gear." fills the seat of Wilson of Iowa. Ex-Governor Knute Nelson. known not so long ago as a member of the house. 'takes the place of Washburn of Minnesota. Mr. Dixon of Rhode Isl and gives way to George Peabody Wetmore. W. J. Sewell, once a mem ber of tihe senate and well known of later years as President Harrtson's hunting companion on many a trip, takes the seat of Mr. MoPherson. Ex Steeretary Elkins, once of the Harrison oalbinet, succeeds Jlohnson Camden of What Virginia. Ex-Senator Warren of Wyoming returns to take the place of Mr. Carey, and Thomas S. Martin of Virg~nla displaces I')ppa Hunton. Not many changes. But the senators serve for six years and .are reasonably sure of reelection. Mr. MorrilI has been in the senate 28 years, Mr. Sher man 30 years. 'Mr. Allison 2Y years. .Mr. flansm had served for 23 years continu'ousky when he retired. Because there are so few newcom er, amonag them tihe gathering of the senators is like the r, union of a big family. No party distinr:-tion's tr drawn as they group thvn'selves on the floor of the senate chamber on the opening day of the sersion. Personal frlenlsi-t> obliterate for a time that imaginary line which separates d, mi crat from renui'i;cin, and the reinr - eeneattives of the parties and of all saetions of 'the ceeun':ry mingle freely, shaking hands. exchanging congratu lataone on improved hteath. swapping a 1:4tle gossip of the late election p r haps.

Dverything is fresh and clein and bright looking. The furniture ha4 been reu'holstered, a new carpet has been laid. The senate wears out a carpet in every congress. 't a senators drop in *me at a time. There are n:t many In their places usu tally when the gavel falls. but on ti I opening day there is a larger number than is cust'rrrary at her times. The gtalrie-s are fairly well filled when, sit 1 minute before 12 o'clock. 'the eastern door I-ad.o'g t') 'tDie lobby opens, and the v:ce prey.dent and the crl'pijin ap;eor. Mr. Stevenson, who fhaua been sys-nding the rummer in Alas ka. anti at his h ,me .n iBl>omingt,,n. and wl.rse ruddy compllxion tells of Improved healtir. and Dr. Milburn. t'he famous blind chaplain, who 'has been in the service of congress off and on F''ne.' he wa.s ,iiyouth, a.nd whose thi'u sam is of m.!es of travel have been in m reised during the congressional rv coma by a 'trip to Europe. The gavel of the vice preaMeiet is an Ivory device, small. and ithaped some thIng like an hour-gkass. It l'ras been its the care of Captain Base tt through the summer, concealed, no one knows' Where, but h:dden as c.anpietely as is the identity of Daniel Wcrters desk. which Bassett' 'ha stored In his mind. When the Gievo Falls The vice prescent takes the L4ttle gavel and taps J,!b.::ly ern the cloth c-)ve red desk. Conv. rsrtt ,n ceases, an I many of the senat.rs rise and re marn steading while the chaplain de livers a brk'f invoc'rtrnn. A.: Its con clot>.!,rn the dOaisrs fill rapidly. There is rr> jotrnal of the last day's Session to read, and the first bueiness to traneact is the swear;ng In of newly-elected sena'icors. Many have been sworn in at the last sessm in ipreparwtion for their tr augwmaton to-day. So this bustness is accompLthed quickly. Then a committee of old senators is appointed to act with a commlttee of members of the house in notifying the presad'nt that congress is in session. After this a recess is taken till the committee is ready to report. Car riages h'ae been waiting to convey the comm::tee to the white house. and the kcurney is mwde quickly. In half hour the committee is back with the information that its du::es have been performed and that the pre.ldent wilt cornmunicate with con gr-es in writing. This formal an n 'uncement presages the coming of the president's message, but it is cue tomary for the prestdent to withhold the message fir a day and to send it in at t"'he beginning of the session ot Tuesday. If this is to be tale pro gramme. the meirers of the commit tee are Informed of the fact, and it re-tly after the report of the commit tee the senate adlourns. ut: the adlournmnnt Is not had until a ft o.I of bills pour in. For even thus ea:"i in e'. sesn the senators are triaerJ. some with new measures w-:ch :save in:ubated during the re cess, some wi:h old measures of which they have printed copies tram the doe ament room. Al these be se seead merely on their titles by C~dt Cark Mo~wan and rterfed by the steees ident to the appropriate coammtees If the mmesae of te psesgeet comes to the semate on the epealag 69y. 6t e woresented by ome of the wilte boose clerk.-smually by Mr. . who is the chief among them i Il watting. caretally eagimesd an peper of a light hbe tint. It M suegaled by pMerted copies, however, M these are distrthuted to the senatreers soon a the written dopy ie placed is the vice oreeldeate hands. Almost immediately after the presen tat4on of the message by Mr. Praden. a oeremowy In wteach the Ana the ample aasststnce of Captain Bassett, the vice president announces that he 'lays before the senate a message elft the preldent of the United States." The secretary of the senate, MW. Oex. takes the document from his hands. opens it and affeots to read from the original document. But ihis is wholly a sham. The read'nx is done from a printed copy. Few of those on the floor listen with much attention. They prefer as a rule to read the message at their leisure later. When the reading of the aammal message von:'luded. whether it he on the day when congress assemble' or the dew following it, the senate ad bourns and the senators go torte to be interviewed. **.. M**tizg of the Hoese. The house is a far more ente in ing nla^o on the first day of a "ion of contress than is the senate. Igng before -noon the members gather, the older ones at the desks which *ere famllar to them in the session which ended on the 4th of Marsh. the young ones at the unoc-&upled desk. Not that the older ones have now any pro prietary right in the dsks they used be fore. A members !nterest in his desk and seat tnis with the ending of cnn gress.

The rules of the hous.' pri - vile tcr a lottery of seats, and two pages are stationed at the clerk's .l" 2 to draw from a box the names of the membes. Each member as his nam' Is celled selects a seat andl takes poe sesagon of It. The least experienced of the new members may have first ohniee of seats, and the father of the house-to whom, by the way, Is Istrusted the euty of swearing in the speaker-may be the last person reached in the 41st. ()Id or new, a menmber must take von session of his uchiosen seat and hoki it' tiH the end of the call, for only pos session is proprietary after the roN call has begun. The Importance of lo cation is better appreciated by the older members. who know how difficult it is in an obscure place to catch the speaker's eye in an effort to address the house. i t"--r incidents of the opening sea Pio:i are the appointment of the mem. be- i u' the joint committee to notify the president and. If the president should send the annual message in. the reading of that document. Here, as In the senate. the message receives but scant attention in the 1 reading. Maost of the members take their printed copies into the committee rooms and read the document at Isis ure these. The hcsuse. too, adjourns as soon as the reading is conie'jded, and the firmt cession is usualy hardly mor-* than an hour or an hour and a h'cif in lengtfh. No bills arn introduced becsue. like the senate, the house has no rules to govsern It. It is acting under general parlamentary law until such tmet as It ms.B adopt the toles of the preoedkw house or tarmulate a code for Itself. It is more than likely that the rules adopted by the house In the Fifty otarth conae. wIM be those prepared under the supervidton of Mr. Reel when he was speaker Wefore, those fa onus rutes whose efaoroemeat woe for him the hatred et the democratio enem berg of the house and gave btan ttrouchout the country the title of The Usseaese ei Cesgress. When the bouse Itmo edopted a code ot rules there will be no lack of bills and resolutloms. There is always much unfinished basiness lft by one coon Cres for dA suoesor to take up. And Mhen Onere are changing omditi on, which teake aeOeswary certain new leg ilab"Jon. Ibr example, the new congreae will have to consider the quention of pro vkling revenue adequate to the gov ernment's experndiure. a condition wthich was not expected whe ,the com proroLse traiff bill wars agreed to. Vice Preeblert Stevenson said this smo mer that the had no doubt the re publicans in congress could agree with the administtrtion on some measures to Increase the revenue w'hic'h would be accep4atble to 'bcuuh parties, but al ready Senator Sherman Is talking about sgreeintg to nothing if it does not In clude proteotton to wool. If all the reptublica.na take the mane view of sthe maeter. It Is not likely any egreement can be reaohed. There would 4e ,s much fighting over loua interests In that eaae as there is when a general 'tariff bill Is under disrusrlon. if the demowrats hid the -h use and senate. It is likely internil revenue taxes would be increased. Even many republicans are slid to favor a tax on "patent mnedicines and an increased tax on 'beer. Then the congress esa the finaneial pr).blem to solve, and that will include, no 'loubt. the recomim n Ist~on made by the pres!Iern just bcf re the 4th of misses for the paesag.. of a law author izing the Issue of b inda to keep up the gold reserve.
