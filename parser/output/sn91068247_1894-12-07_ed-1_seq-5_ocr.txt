Washington, Dec. 3. The following Is the message of Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, trans mitted to both houses of Congress to day: 

OONORESS OF THE UNITED STATES: The assemblage within the nation's legislative halls of those charged with the duty of making laws for the benefit of a generous, free people impressively suggests the exacting obligation and in exorable responsibilityinvolved in their task. At the threshold of such labor now ro be undertaken by the Congress of the United States and in the discharge of an executive duty enjoined by the constitution, I submit this communi cation containing a brief statement ol the condition of our national affairs and recommending such legislation as seems to me necessary and expedient. FOREIGN DELATIONS. The history of your recent dealings with other nations and our peaceful re lations with them at this time afford ad ditional demonstration of the advan tages which constantly adhere to a firm but just foreign policy, free from envi ous or ambitious national schemes and characterized by entire honesty and sin cerity. During the past year, pursuant to a law of Congress, commissioners were appointed to the Antwerp Industrial Exposition. Though the participation of American exhibitors fell far short o completely illustrating our national in genuity and industrial achievement. yet it was quite creditable in view o the brief time allowed for presentation I have endeavored to impress upon tli Belgian government the neediessnet: and pobitive harmfulness of its restric tions upon the importation of certai. food products and have strongly ur-e that the rigid supervision and inspectioi under our laws are amply suflicient V. prevent the exportation from this coun try of diseased cattle and unwholesome meat. The termination of the civil war in Brazil has been followed by general prevalence of peace and order. It ap pearing at an eariy stage ot the insur ruction mat its course would call for unusual watchfulness on the part of this government, our naval force in tuc naiwr ui iuo Janeiro was strengthened. This precaution, I am satisfied, tended to restrict the is sue to a simple trial of strength between l. I :u me Drnzinan government and the in surgents, and to avert complications which at times seemed imminent. Our Urm attitude of neutrality was main i'.iut-u tu me tiiu. ine insurgents re ceived no encouragement of eventua asylum from our commanders and such opposition as they encountered was for the protection of our commerce and was clearly justified by public law. A serious tension of relations having arisen at ine cjose ot the war between Brazil and Portugal by reason of tin wcape of the insurgent Admiral D; (lama and his followers, the friendly offices of our representatives to thos ountnes were exerted for the protec tion of the subjects of either within the territory of the other. Although the government of Brazil was onlv notified . i. . it . , - mat uiu commercial arrangement ex isting between the United States and that country, based on the third section f the tariff law of 1890, was abrogated n August 28, 1894, by the taking effect f the tariff law now in force, that gov ernment subsequently notified the United States of its intention to termi nate, such arrangement on the 1st day f January, 181)5, in the exercise of the right reserved in the agreement bv "cu uiv mu tou ii i nus. mention is ailed to the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Brazilian minister on this subject. The commission organized under the : i wuvcuwou wnicn we nau entered into with Chile for the settlement of the utstanding claims of each government against ine other adionrned at the end f the period stipulated for its continu ance, leaving undetermined a number f American cases which had been duly presented. These claims are not barred and negotiations are in progress for their ubmission to a new tribunal. "ii mc inn oi xuarcn last a new treaty with China, in further regulation "f emigration, was signed at Washing ton, and on August 13th it received the unction of the Senate. Ratification on the part of China and formal exchange ire awaited to give effect to this mu tually beneficial convention. A gratifying recognition of the uni form impartiality of this country towards all foreign States was mani fested by the coincident request of the Chinese and Japanese governments that the agents of the United States should, within proper limits, afford protection to the subjects of the other during the suspension of diplomatic relations due to a state of war. This delicate oftice was accepted, and a misapprehension which gave rise to the belief that in affording this kindly unofficial protec tion Our agents would exercise the same authority which the withdrawn agents of the belligerents had exercised was promptly corrected. Although the war between China and Japan endangers no policy of the United States, it deserve our gravest consideration, by reason of the disturbance of our growing com mercial interests in the two countries and the increased dangers which mav result to our citizens domiciled or s journing in the interior of China. Act- ujj uuuer a stipulation in our tr MU with Corea (the first concluded with a Western power,) I felt constrained at the beginning ot the controversy to tender our good of fices to induce an amicable arrange ment of the initial difficulty growing out of Japanese demands for adminis trative reform in Corea, but the un &appy precipitation of actual hostilities abated this kindly purpose. Pepldring the destructive war be tween the two most powerful Eastern nations, and anxious that our commer cial interests in those countries may be preserved and that the safety of our citizens there shall not be jeopardized, I would not hesitate to heed any in timation that our friendly aid for the honorable termination of hostilities would be acceptable to both belliger ents. A convention has been finally con cluded for the settlement by arbitra tion of the prolonged dispute with Ecu ador, growing out of the proceedings against Emilio Santos, a naturalized citizen of the United States. Our relations with the republic of France continue to be such as should exist between nations so long bound to gether by friendly sympathy and simi larity in their form of government. The recent cruel assassination of the Presi dent of this sister republic called forth such universal expression of sorrow and condolence from our people and gov ernment as to leave no doubt of the depth and sincerity of our attachment The resolutions passed by the Senate and House of Representatives on the occasion have been communicated to the widow of President Carnot. . Acting upon the reported discovery of Texas fever in cargoes of American cattle, the German prohibition against importations of live stock and fresh meats from this country has been re vived. It is hoped that Germany will soon oecome convinced that the inhibi tion is as needless as harmful to mutual interests. ine German government has protested against that provision of the customs tariff act which imposes discriminating duty of one-tenth of 1 cent a pound on sugars coming from countries paying an export bounty thereon, claiming that the exaction of such duty is in contravent ion of articles 5 and 9 of the treaty of 1828 with Prussia In the interest of the commerce of both countries and to avoid even the accusa tion of treaty violation I recommend A. . - t P 1 m . t uie repeat oi so mucn oi tne statue as imposes that duty and I invite atten tion to the accompanying report of the Secretary of State containing a discus- sion oi ine questions raised by the Ger man protests. E,arly in the present year an agree ment was reacnea with Ureat Britain concerning instructions to be given to the naval commanders of the two gov ernments in Bering Sea, and the con tiguous North Pacific Ocean, for their guidance in the execution of the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration and the enforcement of the regulations therein prescribed for the protection of seal me in the waters mentioned. An understanding has also been reached for the payment by the United States of $425,000 in full satisfaction of all claims which may be made by Great Britain for damages growing out of the controversy as to fur seals in Bering . i : e t , . j , , oca, ur ine seizure 01 Xirilisn vessels en' gaged in taking seals in those waters, The award and findings of the Paris nounal to a great extent determined he facts and principles upon which hese claims should be adjusted, and aey have been subjected by both gov- i-nments to a thorough examination pon the principles as well as the facts men they involve. I am convinced iiat a settlement upon the terms men .oned would be an equitable and ad- tntageous one, and 1 recommend thai rovision be made for prompt payment i tne stated sum. lhus far onl . ranee and Portugal have signified rheir willingness to adhere to the regu lations established under the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration. Preliminary surveys of the Alaskan oounuary ana a preparatory examina tion of the question of protection of food fish in the contiguous waters of the Lnited States and the Dominion of Canada are in progress. The boundary of British Guinea still remains in dispute between Great Brit ain anu enezuela. Believing that its early settlement on some just basis. alike honorable to both parties, in the line of our established policy to remove trom this hemisphere all causes of dif ference with powers beyond the seas, I will renew the efforts heretofore made to bring about a restoration of diplo matic relations between the disputants and induce a reference to arbitration, a resort which Great Britain so conspicu ously favors in principle and respects in practice, and which is earnestly sought oy her weaker adversary. Since communicating the voluminous correspondence in regard to Hawaii. the action taken by the Senate and House of Representatives on certain questions committed to the judgment and wider discretion of Congress, the organization of a government in place ot the provisional arrangement which followed the deposition of the Queen has been announced with evidence of its effective operation. The recogni tion usual in such cases has been ac corded the new government. Under our present treaties of extradi tion with Italy miscarriages of justice have occurred, owing to the refusal o that government to surrender its owi suojecis. inus iarour ettorts to nego tiate an amended agreement obviating this difficulty have been unavailing. Apart from the war in which the Island Empire is engaged, Japan at tracts increasing attention in thiscoun try by her evident desire to cultivate more liberal intercourse with us and to seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her laudable desire for complete au tonomy in her domestic affairs and full equality in the family of nations. The Japanese empire of to-day is no longer the Japan of the past and our relations with this progressive nation should not be less broad and liberal than those with other powers. Good will, fostered by many interests in common, has marked our re lations with our nearest Southern neigh bor. Peace being restored along her northern frontier, Mexico has asked the punishment of the late disturbers of her tranquility. There ought to be a new treaty of commerce and navigation with that country to take the place of the one which terminated thirteen years ago. The friendliness of the intercourse be tween the two countries' is attested bv the fact that during this long period the commerce of each has steadily increased under the role of mutual consideration, being neither stimulated by convention al arrangements nor retarded by jeak us rivalries or selfish distrust. An indem nity tendered by Mexico as a gracious act for tne murder in 1887 of Leon Baldwin, an American citizen, by a band of marauders in Durango, has been accepted and is being paid in install ments. The problem of the storage and use of the waters of the Rio Grande for irrigation should be resolved by appro- mate concurrent action of the two in terested countries. Rising in the Col- rado heights, the stream flows inter nittently, yielding little water during he dry months to the irrigating chan iels already constructed along its ;ourse. This scarcity is often severe v felt in the regions where the river forms a common boundary. Moreover, he frequent changes in its course through level sands often raise embar rassing questions of territorial jurisdic tion. Prominent among the questions of the year was the Bluefields incident, in what is known as the Mosquito Indian strip bordering on the Atlantic Ocean and within the jurisdiction of Nicara gua. By the treaty of 1860 between Great Britain and Nicaragua, the for mer government expressly recognized the sovereignty of the latter over the strip and a limited form of self-government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians, to be exercised according to their . customs,' for themselves and other dwellers . within : its limits. This so-called " government, which grew to be largely made up of aliens, for many years disputed the sov ereignty of Nicaragua over the strip and claimed the right to maintain therein a practically independent mu nicipal government. Early in the past year efforts of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over the Mosqnito terri tory led to serious disturbances, culmi nating in the suppression of the native government and the attempted substi tution of 'an impracticable composite administration in which Nicaraguan and alien residents were to participate. t allure was followed by an insurrection which for a time subverted Nicaraguan rule, expelling her officers and restrict ing the old organization. This, in turn, gave place to the existing local govern ment, established and upheld by Nic aragua. Although the alien interests arrayed against Nicaragua in these transactions have been largely Ameri can, and the commerce of that region for some time has been, and still is, chiefly controlled by our citizens, we cannot for that reason challenge the rightful sovereignty of Nicaragua over this important part of her domain. For some months one, and during part of the time two, of our naval ships have been stationed at Blueflelds for the pro tection of all legitimate interests of our citizens. In September last the gov ernment at Managua expelled from its territory twelve or more for eigners, including two Americans, for alleged participation in the seditions or revolutionary movements against the republic at Bluefields already mentioned, but through the ear nest remonstrance of this government the two Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful management of their business. Our naval command ers at the scene of these disturbances, by their constant exhibition of firmness and good judgment contributed largely to the prevention or more serious conse sequences and to the restoration of quiet and order. I regret that in the midst of these ocurrences there hap pened a most grave and irritating fail ure oi iMcaraguan justice. An Ameri can citizen named Wilson, residing at Rama, in the Mosquito Territory, was murdered by one Arguulo, the acting Governor of the town. After some de lay the murderer was arrested, but so insecurely confined or guarded that he escaped, and, notwithstanding our re peated demands, it is claimed that his recapture has been impossible by rea son of his flight beyond Nicaraguan ju risdiction. The Nicaragua authorities hav ing given notice of the forfeiture of their concession to the canal company on grounds, purely technical and not embraced in the contract, have receded from that proposition. Peru, I regret to say, shows symptoms oi domestic disturbance, due probably to the slowness of her recuperation from the distresses of the war of 1881 v eakened in resources, her difficulties in paying international obligations invite our kindly sympathy and justify jur forbearance in pressing long pend ing claims. I have felt constrained to testify this sympathy in connection with certain demands urgently pre ferred by other powers. The recent death of the Czar of Rus sia called forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and sympathy on the part of our government with his bereaved family and the Russian people. As a further demonstration of respect and friendship our minister at St. Peters burg was directed to represent our gov ernment at the iuneral ceremonies. The sealing interests of Russia in Be ring Sea are second only to our own. A modus vivendi has therefore been con eluded with the imperial government restrictive of poaching on the Russian rookeries and of scaling in waters which were not comprehended in the protected area defined in the Paris award. Occa sion has been found to urge upon the Russian government equality of treat ment for our great life insurance companies, whose operations have been extended throughout Europe. Admitting, as we do, foreign corpora tions to transact business in the United States, we naturally expected no less tolerance for our own in the ample fields of competition abroad. But few cases of interference with naturalized citizens returning to Russia have been reported during the current year. One Krzeminski was arrested last summer in a Polish province on a reported charge of unpermitted renunciation of Russian allegiance but it transpired that the proceedings originated in al leged malfeasance committed by Krze minski while an imperial official a num ber of years ago. Efforts for his release, which promised to be successful, were in progress when his death was re ported. The government of Salvador having been overthrown by an abrupt popular outbreak, certain of its military and civil officers while hotly pursued by in furiated insurgents sought refuge on board our warship, Bennington, then lying in a Salvadorean port. Although the practice of asylum is not favored by this government, yet in view of the imminent peril which threatened the fugitives and solely from considerations of humanity they were afforded shelter by our naval commander and when af terwards demanded under our treaty of extradition with Salvador for trial on charges of murder, arson and robbery, I directed that such of them as had not voluntarily left the ship be conveyed to one of our nearest ports where a hear ing could be had before a judicial offi cer in compliance with the terms of the treaty. On their arrival at San Fran cisco such a proceeding was promptly instituted before the United States dis trict judge, who held that the acts con stituting the alleged offenses were po litical and discharged all the accused except one Cienfugos, who was held for an attempt to murder, thereupon I was constrained to direct his release for the reason that an attempt to mur der was not one of the crimes charged against him and upon which his sur render to the Salvadorean authorities had been demanded. Unreasonable and unjust fines im posed by Spain on the vessels and com merce of the United States have de manded from time to time during the last twenty years earnest remonstrance on the part of our government. In the immediate past exorbitant penalties have been imposed upon our vessels and good3 by the customs authorities of Cuba and Porto Rico for clerical errors of the most trivial character in the manifests or bills of lading. In some cases fines amounting to thousands of dollars have been levied upon cargoes or the carrying vessels v hen the goods in question were entitled to free entry. Fines have been exacted even when the error had been detected and the Spanish authorities notified before the arrival of the goods in port. This conduct is in strange contrast with the considerate and liberal treatment of Spanish con suls and cargoes in our ports in like cases. No satisfactory settlement of these vexatious questions has been ar ranged. The Mora case, referred to in my last annual message, remains unset tled. From the diplomatic correspond ence on this subject, which has been laid before the Senate, it will be seen that this government has offered to con clude convention with Spain for dis- posal by arbitration of outstanding claims between the two countries, . ex cept the Mora claim, which having been long ago adjusted, now' only awaits pay ment as stipulated, and of course it could mtbi included in the proposed conven mm. it was hoped this offer would remove parliamentary obstacles encountered by the Spanish government in providing payment of the Mora in demnity. I regret to say that no defi nite reply to this offer has yet been made and all efforts to secure payment of this settled claim have been unavail ing. In my last annual message, I adverted to the claim on the part of Turkey of the right to expel, as persons undesira ble and dangerous, Armenians natural ized in the United States, and returning to Turkish jurisdiction. Numerous questions in this relation have arisen. While this government acquiesces in the asserted right of extradition, it will not consent that Armenians may be imprisoned or otherwise punished for no other reason than having acquired without imperial consent American citizenship. Three of the assailants of Miss Melton, an American teacher in Mosul, have been convicted by the Ot toman courts, and I am advised that an appeal against the acquittal of the re maining five has been taken by the Turkish prosecuting officers. A convention has been concluded with Venezuela for the arbitration of a long-disputed claim growing out of the seizure of certain vessels, the property of citizens of the United States. Al though signed, the treaty Of extradi tion with Venezuela is not yet in force, owing to the insistence of that govern ment that, when surrendered, its citi zens shall in no case be liable to capi tal punishment. The rules for the prevention of col lisions at sea which were framed by the maritime conference held in thiB city in iou, having been concurrently in corporated in the statutes of the United States and Great Britain, have been an n'ounced to take effect March llfh, 1895, and invitations have been ex tended to all maritime nations to ad here to them. Favorable responses have thus far been received from A us tria, France, Portugal, Spain and Swe den. In mv last annnal message I referred briefly to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Samoa under the opera tion of the lienin treaty as sig nally illustrating the impolicy of en tangling alliances with foreign powers, and on May 9, 1894, in response to a resolution of the Senate I sent a special message and documents to that body on the same subject, which emphasized my previously expressed opinions Later occurrences, the correspondence in regard to which will be laid before Congress, further demonstrate that the government which was devised by the three powers and forced upon the Sa- moans against their inveterate hostility can be maintained onlv by the con tinued presence of foreign military force and no small sacrifice of life and treasure. The suppression of the Mataafa insurrection by the powers, and the subsequent banishment of the leader and eleven other chiefs, as re cited in my last message, did not bring lasting peace to the islands. Formida ble uprisings continued and finally re bellion broke out in the capital island, Upolu, headed in Aana, the western district, by the younger, Tamasese, and in Matua, the eastern district, by other leaders. Ihe insurgents ravaged the country and fought the government's troops up to the very doors of Apia. The King again appealed to the powers for help and the combined British and German naval forces reduced the At uans to subjection, not, however, with out considerable loss to the natives. A few days later, Tamases and his adher ents, fearing the ships and marines, professed submission. Reports received from our agents at Apia do not justify the belief that the peace thus brought about will be of long duration. It is their conviction that the natives are at heart hostile to the present government; that such of them as profess loyalty to it do so from tear of the powers and that it would speedily go to pieces if the war ships were withdrawn. In re porting to his government on the unsat isfactory situation since the suppres sion of the late revolt, by foreign armed forces, the German consul at Apia stated: "That peace will be lasting is hardly to be presumed." The lesson given by firing on Atua was not suffi ciently sharp and incisive to leave a lasting impression on the forgetful Sa moan temperament. In fact, condi tions are existing which show that peace will not last and it is not serious ly intended. Malietoa, the King, and his chiefs are convinced that the depart ure of that warship will be a signal for a renewal of war. The circumstances that the representatives of the villages of all the districts which were opposed to the government have already with drawn to Atua to hold meetings and that both Atua and Aana have forbid den inhabitants of those districts which fought on the side of the government to return to their villages and have al ready partly burned down the latter, indicates that a real conciliation of the parties is still far off." And ina noteof the 18th ult., inclosing a copy of that report for the information of this gov ernment, the German ambassador said: "The contents of the report awakened the imperial government's apprehen sion that under existing circumstances the peace concluded with the rebels will afford no assurance of the lasting restoration of tranquility in the islands. The present government has utterly failed to correet, if indeed it has not aggravated, the very evils it was in tended to prevent. It has not stimu lated our commerce with the islands. Our participation in its establishment against the wishes of the natives was plain defiance of the conservative teach ings and warnings of the wise and pa triotic men who laid the foundation of our free institutions and I invoke an expression of the judgment of Congress on the propriety of steps being taken by this government looking to the with drawal of its engagements with the other powers on some reasonable terms not prejudicial to any of the existing rights. THE 

SECRETARY OF TILE TREASURY'S RE PORT. The Secretary of the Treasury re ports that the receipts of the govern ment from all sources of revenue dur ing the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, am6unted to $372,802,498.29 and its ex penditures to $442,605,758.87, leaving a deficit of $69,803,260.58. There was a decrease of $15,952,674.60 in the ordi nary expenses of the government as compared with the fiscal year 1893. There was collected from customs $131, 818.530.62 and from internal revenue $147,168,449.70. The balance of the in come for the year, amounting to $93, 815,517.97, was derived from the sale of lands and other sources. The value of our total dutiable im ports amounted to $275,199,086, being $146,657,625 less than during the preced ing year, and the importations free of duty amounted to $379,795,536, being $64,748,675 less than during the preced ing "vear. The receipts from customs were $73,536,486.11 less; and from inter nal revenue $13,836,539.97 less than in 1893. The total tax collected from dis tilled spirits was $85,259,250.25; on manufactured topacoo $28,617,898,62, and on fermented liquors $31,414,788.04. Our exports of merchandise, domes-: tic and foreign, amounted during the year to $892,140,572, being an in crease over the preceding year of $44, 495,378. - - The total amount of gold exported during the fiscal year was $76,898,061 as against $108,680,444 during the fiscal year 1893. The amount imported was $72,449,119 as against $21,174,381 during the previous year. The imports of sil ver were $13,286,552 and the exports were $50,451,265. The total bounty paid upon the pro duction of sugar in the United States for the fiscal year was $12,100,208.89, being an increase of $2,725,078.01 over the payments made during the preced ing year. The amount of bounty paid from July 1st, 1894, to Augnst 28th, 1894, the time when further payments ceased by operation of law, was $966, 185.84. The total expenses incurred in the payment of the bounty upon sugar during the fiscal year was $130, 140. 8o. it is estimated that upon the basis of the present revenue laws the receipts of the government during the current fiscal year ending June 30th, 1895, will be $424,427,748.44, and its expenditures $444,427,748.44, resulting in a deficit $2,000,000. On the first day of November, 1894, the total stock of money of all kinds in the country was $2,240,773,888 as against $2,204,651,000 on the first day of No vember, 1893, and the money of all kinds in circulation, or not included in the treasury holdings, was $1,672,093, 422, or $24.27 per capita upon an esti mated population of 68,887,000. At the same date there was held in the Treas ury gold bullion amounting to $44,615, 177,55, and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $127,779,988. The purchase of silver bullion under the act of July 14, 1890, ceased on the 1st day of . November, 1893, and up to that time there had been purchased during the fiscal year 11,917,658.78 fine ounces at a cost of $8,715,521.32, an average cost of $0.7313 per fine ounce. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that law took effect until the repeal of its purchasing clause on the date last men tioned was $168,674,682.53 fine ounces, which cost $155,931,002.25, the average price per fine ounce being $0.9244. The total amount of standard silver dollars coined at the mints of the United States 6ince the passage of the act of Febru ary 28, 1878, is $421,776,408, of which $378,166,793 were coined under the pro visions of that act; $38,531,143 under the provisions of the act of July 14 1890, and $5,078,472 under the act pro viding for the coinage of trade dollar bullion. The total coinage of all metals aC'all mints during the last fiscal year consisted of 63,485,220 pieces, valued at $iuu,2iu,au.uu, or wnicn there were $99,474,912.50 in gold coined; $7,580,000 in standard silver dollars; $6,024,140.30 in subsidiary silver coin, and $716,919.26 in minor coin. During the calendar year. 1893 the production of precious metals in the United States was estimated at 1,739,323 fine ounces of gold, of the commercial and coinage value of $35,955,000, and 60, 000,000 fine ounces of silver, of the bul lion or market value of $46,800,000 and of the coinage value of $77,576,000.

Loans and dis counts were $161,206,923 more than at the same time the previous year, and checks and other cash items were $90, 349,963 more. The total resources of the banks at the date mentioned amounted to $3,473,922,055 as against $3,109,563,284.36 in 1803. THE 

SECRETARY OF WAR'S REPORT. From the report of the Secretary of War it appears that the strength of the army on September 30, 1894, was 2,135 officers and 25,765 enlisted men. Al though this is apparently a very slight decrease compared with the previous year, the army really has been increased to the equivalent of nearly two regi ments through the re-organization of the system of recruiting, and the conse quent release to regimental duty of the large force of men hitherto serving at the recruiting depots. The abolition of these depots, as predicted, will further more effect an annual reduction ap proximating $250,000 in the direct ex penditures, besides promoting generally the health, morals and discipline of the troops. The execution of the policy of concentrating the army at important centres of population and transpor tation, foreshadowed in the last annual report of the Secretary, has resulted in the abandonment of fifteen of the smaller posts which was effected under a plan which assembles organizations of the same regiments hitherto widely separated, lhis ren ders our small forces more readily effective for any service which they may be called upon to perform, increases the extent of the territory under pro tection without diminishing the se curity heretofore afforded to any local ity, improves the discipline, training and esprit de-corps of the army, besides considerably decreasing the cost or its maintenance. Though the forces of the Department of the East have been somewhat increased, more than three- fourths of the army is still sta tioned west of the Mississippi. This carefully matured policy, which secures the "best and greatest ser vice, in the interest of the general wel fare, from the small force comprising our regular army, should not be thought lessly embarrassed by the creation of new and unnecessary posts through acts of Congress to the ambitions or interests of localities. While the maximum legal strength of the army is 2o,000 men, the effective strength through various causes is but little over 20,000 men. The purpose of Congress does not therefore seem to be fully attained by the existing conditions. While no considerable in crease in the army is in my judgment demanded by recent events, the policy of seacoast fortification, in the prosecu tion of whieh we have been steadily en gaged for some years, has so far devel oped as to suggest that the effective strength of the army be now made at least equal to the legal strength. Meas ures taken by the department aunng the vear. as indicated, have already con siderably augmented the effective force and the Secretary ot war presents a plan which I recommend to the consid eration of Congress to attain the de sired end. Economy manifested in the department in the lines of its work will offset to a great extent the expenditure involved in the proposition submitted. Among other things this contemplates the adoption of the three-battalion for mation of regiments which for several years has been indorsed bylhe Secreta ries oi r ana tne generals command ing tne army, uompact in itself, it pro vides a skeleton .organization ready to be filled out in the event of war, which is peculiarly adapted to our strength and requirements; and the fact that every other nation with a single excep tion, nas aaoptea mis xormation to meet the condition of modern warfare, should alone secure for the recommendation an early consideration. It is hardly -necessary to recall the fact that, in' obedience to the com mands of the constitution and the laws, and for the purpose of protectinsr the property of the United States, aiding the process of Federal Courts and re moving lawless obstructions to the per formance by the government of its legitimate functions, it became neces sary in various localities during the year to employ a considerable portion of the regular troops. The dutv was discharged promptly, courageously and wun marnea aiscrei on dv the officers and men, and the most gratifying proof was thus afforded that the army de serves that complete confidence in its efficiency and discipline which the country has at all times manifested. Ihe year has been free from disturb ances by Indians, and the ehances of further depredations on their part are constantly becoming more remote and improbable. The total expenditures for the War Department for the year ending June autn, 18U4, amounted to $56,039,009.34 Of this sum $2,000,613.99 was for sala ries and contingent expenses, $23,665, 156.16 for the support of the military establishment, $5,001,682.23 for miscel laneous objects, and $25,371,555.96 for public works. This latter sum includes $19,494,037.49 for river and harbor im provements and $3,947,813.56 for de fense. The appropriations for the cur rent year aggregate $52,429,112.78, and the estimates submitted by the Secretary of War for the next fiscal year call for appropriations amounting to $52,318,- 629.55. The skill and industry of our ord ance officers and inventors have, it is believed, overcome the mechanical ob stacles which heretofore delayed the armament of our coasts and this great national unaertaKing upon which we have entered may now proceed as rapid ly as congress shall determine. With a supply of finished guns of large cali bre already on hand to which additions should now rapidly follow, the wisdom of providing carriages and emplace ments for their mount cannot be too strongly urged. The total enrollment of the militia of the several States is U7,o&( omcers ana enlisted men, an in crease of 5,343 over the number reported at the close or the previous year The reports of militia inspections by regular army officers show a marked in crease in interest and efficiency among the btate organizations and 1 strongly recommend a continuance of the policy oi affording every practical encourage ment possible to this important auxil iary of the military establishment. The condition of the Apache Indians, held as prisoners by the government for eight years at a cost of half a million dollars, has been changed during the year from captivity to one which gives them an opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for self support and at least partial civilization. Legislation enacted at the late session of Congress gave the War Department authority to transfer the survivors, numbering 346, from Mount Vernon barracks in Alabama to any suitable reservation. The depart ment selected as their future home the military lands near Fort Sill, Indian Territory, where, under military sur veillance, the former prisoners have been established in agriculture under conditions favorable to their advance ment. In recognition of the long and dis tinguished military services and faith ful discharge of delicate and responsi ble civil duties by Major General John M. Schofield, now the general command ing the army, it is suggested to Con gress that the temporary revival of the grade of lieutenant general in his be half would be a just and gracious act and would permit his retirement now near at hand with rank befitting his merits. THE ATTORLEY GENERAL 8 RECOMMENDA TIONS APPROVED. The report of the Attorney General notes the gratifying progress made by the Supreme Court in overcoming the arrears of its business and in reaching a condition in which it will be able to dis pose of cases as they arise without any unreasonable delay. This result is of course very largely due to the success ful working of the plan inaugurating Circuit Courts or Appeal. In respect to these tribunals the suggestion is made in quarters entitled to the high est consideration that an addition al circuit judge for each cir cuit would greatly strengthen these courts and the confidence reposed in their adjudiciations, and that such an addition would not create a greater force of judges than the increasing business of such courts requires. I com mend the suggestion to the careful con sideration of the Congress. Other impor tant topics are adverted to in the re? port, accompanied by recommenda tions, many of which have been treated at large in previous messages; and at this time therefore need only be named. I refer to the abolition of the fee system as a measure of compensation to Fed eral officers; the enlargement of the powers of United States commissioners, at least in the territories;the allowance of writs of error in criminal caseson behalf of the United States, and the establish ment of degrees in the crime of murder. A topic dealt with by the Attorney Gen eral of much importance is the condi tion of the administration of justice in the Indian Territory. The permanent solution of what is called the Indian problem is probably not to be expected at once, but in the meanwhile such ameliorations of present conditions as the existing system will admit of ought not to be neglected. I am satisfied there should be a Federal Court estab lished for the Territory with sufficient judges, and that this court should sit within the Territory and have the same jurisdiction as to territorial affairs as is now vested in the Federal Courts sit ting in Arkansas and Texas. Another subject of pressing moment referred to by the Attorney General is the re-organization of the Union Pacific Railway Company on a basis equitable as regards all private interests and as favorable to the government as existing conditions will permit. The operation of a railroad by a court through a re ceiver is an anomalous state of things which should be terminated on all grounds, public and private, at the ear liest possible moment. Besides, not to enact the needed enabling legislation at the present session postpones the whole matter until the assembling of a new OmoTPss and inevitably increases all the complications of the situation, and could not but be regarded as a signal failure to solve a problem which has practically been before the present Con gress ever since its organization. TWO 

FEDERAL PRISONS NEEDED. Eight years ago in my annual message I urged upon the . Congress as strongly as I could the location and construction of two prisons for the confinement of United states prisoners, a simuar recommendation has been made from time to time since and a few years ago a law was passed providing for the se lection of sites for thTee such institu tions. No appropriation has, however,, ' been made to carry the act into ef fect, and the old and discredit able condition still exists, it is not my purpose at this time to re- , peat the considerations which make ah impregnable case in favor of the owner- ship and management by the govern- ment of the penal institutions in which Federal prisoners are confined. . i simpiy desire to again rge former "recommen dations on the subject and to particu larly call the attention ot the congress to that part or the report oi . me Secretary of War, in which he states that the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., can be turned over to the government as a prison for Fed eral convicts without the least difficul ty and with an actual saving of money from every point of view. Pending a more complete reform I hope that by the adoption of the suggestion of the Secretary of War this easy step may be taken in the -direction oi tne proper care of its convicts by the government of the United State". THE POSTAL SYSTEM AX ABCSE TO BK CORRECTED. The report of the Postmaster General presents a comprehensive statement of the operations or the Postomce uepari ment for the last fiscal year. The re ceipts of the department during the year amounted to $75,080,479.04, and the expenditures to $84,324,414.15. The transactions of the postal service indi cate with barometric certainty the actuations in the business of the coun try. Inasmuch, therefore, as business complications continued to exist throughout the last year to an uniore- seen extent it is not surprising that the deficiency of revenue to meet the ex penditures of the Postottice depart ment, which was estimated in advance at about $8,000,000, should be exceeded by nearly one and a quarter million doi; lars. The ascertained revenues of the last year which were the basis of calcu lation for the current year will be cor respondingly greater, though the Post master General states that the latest in dications are so favorable that he con fidently predicts an increase of at least 8 per cent, in the revenues of the cur rent year over those oZ last year. The expenditures increaso steadily and necessarily with the growth and needs of the country, so that the defi ciency is greater or less a year depend ing upon the volume of the receipts. The Postmaster General states that his deficiency is unnecessary and might be obviated at once if the law regulating rates upon mail matter of the second class was modified. The rate received for the transmission of this second class matter is one cent per pound, while the cost of such transmission to the government is eight times that amount. In the general terms of the law this rate covers newspapers and periodicals. The extensions of the meaning of these terms from time to time have admitted to the privileges in tended for legitimate newspapers and periodicals a surprising range of publi cations and created abuses, the cost of which amount in the aggregate to the total deficiency of the Postottice Depart ment. Pretended newspapers are start ed by business houses for the mere pur pose of advertising goods, complying with the law in form only and discon tinuing the publications as soon as the period OI aUVertlSillK la wcr. uamyia copies" of pretended newspapers are is sued in great numbery for a like purpose onlv. The result is a great loss of revenue to me government besides its humiliat ing use as an ingenuity tofcid in carrying out the scheme of a business house to advertise its goods by means of a trick upon both its rival houses and the reg ular newspapers. Paper covered liter ature, consisting mainly of trashy novels, to the extent of many thousands of tons, is sent through the mails at 1 cent per pound while the publishers of standard works are required to pay eight times that amount in sending these publications. Another abuse is the free carrying through the mails of thousands of tons of seed and grain use lessly distributed through the Depart ment of Agriculture. The Postmaster General predicts that if the law be so amended as to eradicate these abuses, not only will the Postoffice Department show no deficiency, but he believes that in the near future all legitimate news papers and periodical magazines might be properly transmitted through the mails to their subscribers free of cost. I invite your prompt consideration of this subject, and fully endorse the views of the Postmaster General. The total number of postofflces in the United States on the 30th day of June, 1894, was 69,850, an increaso of 1,403 over the preceding year. Of these 3, 428 were presidential, an increase in that class of 68 over the preceding year. Six hundred and ten towns and cities are provided with free delivery. Ninety-three other cities and towns entitled to this service under the law have not been accorded it on account of insufficient funds. The expense of free delivery for the current fiscal year will be more than $12,300,000, and under ex isting legislation this item of expendi ture is subject to constant increase. The estimated cost of retail free deliv ery is so very large that it ought not to be considered in the present condition of affairs. During the year 830 addi tional domestic money order offices were established. The total number of the offices at the close of the year was 19,264. There were 14,304,041 money orders issued during the year, being an increase over the preceding year of 994,306. The value of these orders amounted to $138,793,579.49 at an in crease of $11,217,145.84. There were also issued during the year postal notes amounting to $12,649,094.55. During the year 218 international money order offices were added to these already es tablished, making a total of 2,625 such offices in operation June 30, 1894. The number of international money orders issued during the year was 917, 823, a decrease in number of 138,176 and their value was $13,792,455.31, a de crease in amount of $2,549,382.55. The number of orders paid was 361,180, an increase over the preceding year of 60,- 263, and their value was $6,568,49.. 8, an increase of $1,285,118.08. From the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money or ders and postal notes for the year amounted to $165,235,129.35. The number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special de livery was 3,346,970. The special deliv ery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted to $343,697. The messengers' fees paid for their delivery amounted to $261,209.70, leaving a bal ance in favor of the government of $82, 4S7.30. The report shows most gratify ing results in the way of economies worked out without affecting the effi ciency of the postal service. These consist in the abrogation or steam- snip suosiay contracts, re-letting of mail transportation contacts, and in the cost and amount of T-.APplies used t the service, amounting insil to $16,619, 047. 42.
