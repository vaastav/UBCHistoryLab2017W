SILVER. The decline of 6ilver to its old price of lart April, when the new silver law was passed, leads the New York Commercial Bulletin to call attention to the new campaign in favor of free silver coinage, ! v.iiich is pretty certain to be waged when congress meets for its second session. From 9SJ j cents per ounce on the 15th of April the price rose to $1.21 in August, when the government began it purchases under the new law. With these purchases the decline began, and it ha -teadily progreseed until it has now r-; : d the old figures. The reason for the dn ' i is not dificult to find. No sooner w:; :Le law t sssed than scores of ruir.t-s which : a i not been worked fr years began to be operated again, d the output of numerous other mines was largely increased. With the prospect of higher prices the outward current of silver from this country was 'most completely arrested, while im portation ol European ouinon ana or Mexican silver ore begHn. Says the Buil- tin: "The- thine which most needs at- ention here Is that the American mines have for six ;non'.h supplied all the de mand, excepting Mis above mention im- iation of ore, hv that the foreign mines have likewise supplied for six lrmths all tlii d-mandi in all ether untr.v-3 wiir-out the usual aid from United States.

In some wa; , tne entire ioreign aemana nas oeen b,i; (lien, notvitnflianaing mis increase, wit- ut the tlO,000.000 worth of silver usually receiyed from ;this country ia a half year. This points clearly to an incresse in the output of foreign mines. And in some way the treasurer has been r applied with 4,500,000 ounces per month by mines in this county, while require entn for the arts have been met by importations of ore, so that the produc ion of American mines alone apparently no re than meets the treasury de- inanus. ino i)reBtnt. law naying iauen iiertfove, to n;eet the expectations of e silver advocates, the demand will ni,v bs rtncvni lor ire coinage. .ms vili rrovtdc an unlimited instead cf a l'liite ' deaif-nd. and at a fixed price ii ouiinrd doli'irH thptis, Rbout 1129 per il:v. thouirlit the highest limit ranched t!ie rf ceut rise, ith all American ilvcr .-di.-wrbed by the treasurer, wa 3i! ?'1.21 per ounce.

At a New York banquet the other night, Coancey Depew gave some prac tical ideas of reciprocity in his own in imitable w ay. Mr. Depew said in brief "South ot us lie the republics of the other America and the Isthmus. They have a population of 50,000,000 and ter rilorios which can safely support $1,000 n.000. Immicration is pouring m there at the rate of 500,000 people in year. They require in constantly in creasing quantities the bread stufT the q provisions, the petrol eum, the agricultural machinery, most of which we can furnish cheaper an '.setter, and all of which as cheep as an nation in the world. The conditions c our trade with South America are stigma upon os as a commercial nation We buv from South America 312,000. 000 worth of goods more than we se them. This is paid in cash tbrouir London, ,and tho English banker toi i.xita from us over a miiiion of dollar3 n commiseionsfor the transactions of th business. ;Tt is. easy to imagine tbe in faleulable advantages whicn our mer chants, farmers, manufactures and rail roads would derive from reciprocal pur "l-.fir.pn from us. if only to the extent ol .his 5112,000,000 a year. Imports to th value of t233,000'000 were sold in tw South American Republics in 1883. Ou farms and factories could have supplieo every article which entered those ports Out of this vast sum the United State secured only f 13,000,000. The res went to England, Germany and France Of the 1742.000,000 worth of export from the United States in 1833 only $09. 000,000 went to the whole of Spanisl America." The President's message was receivee and printed in the Citizen before any other paper in the territory. It is an ex ceptional strong, pointed message anu contains much sound tease. The execu tive's firm stand on our foreign relations in rnnneetion with the lamented Bar undia affair and the Behring Sea cou troversy; his unchanged attitude on th arilf bill; his friendahip for silver legis tation; for the eellers; his hastility to Chinese immigration and pauper labo of all kinds; his admirable expression on reciprocity, all commend him as statesman of comprehension ana pat riotism. The message for a presideuti message is free from ambiguity an platitudes. The president dignifys every thinf by the right name and whips nothing about the stump. He shows th zealous care which an executive of thi mighty nation should exercise in all things relating to our foreign trade and home commerce, inrougu an mere exists a spirit of Americanism which w ill be appreciated by democrats and republicans alike who hold their own country above any other nation on the face of the globe.

The 8nors of the Gazette have evidently not read the latest reliable and authorata- tive report from the cactus beds of the Santa Cruz.

LATEST IN LETTERS. Never use a postal card. The colloquial style is by far the most agreeable while a didactic method, of expression is unpleasant and to bo avoided. ' In fashionable stationery tho faintest shade of pink is the latest, there being water mark of Cupid with his sug gestive bow and arrow. A married woman's letters always should be addressed in the name of her husband, as "Mrs. Romaino Brown, instead of "Mrs. Amelia Brown." Black ink is the rule, although some women, notably those with romantic proclivities, affect violet ink, which, it must be admitted, Hows easier and is of a superior quality t3 the ebony fluid. The angular English style of hand writing, although neither legible nor symmetrical, is the one in high favor, the flowing Italian and the cramped French chirography being quite out of date. Good sense and good taste should govern ones correspondence as 11 should all other things, and a man or woman of fine breeding, education and heart will not go very far astray in the inditing of polite epistles. Women who should know better often sicrn themselves "Mrs. bo-and-bo or "Miss So-and-So," instead of using their Christian names. This is the acme of vulgarity, but if, when writing to a stranger, it is necessary to state whether Miss or Mrs., place the prefix in parentheses as "(.Mrs.) Amelia Brown." . Crests, monograms and initials, once so fashionable, are rarely seen, al though certain people have nover given up the illuminated cipher or crest. The most fastidious letter-writers have simply tho address, engraved in either black or colors, in a fac simile of their own handwriting, and running across one corner or at the top of the page TniCK, cream-laid note, hand-finish linen, or linen-bond paper is plain, elegant and agreeable to write upon. The fashionable paper folds but once into a square envelope, and outre sizes are but little used. The square corre spondence card is a thing of the past, and dainty note paper, which fits into an cnvelopo without folding, is sub stituted. Tho gray paper and white ink, which wa3 a French caprice, had brief existence, and was received with favor by misses in their teens and wom en in search of the bizarre. A BATCH FOR THE BOTANIST. TIte newest freak in begonias is tuberous-rooted variety bearing fringed flowers. It is said to be very beautiful. The common sweet-william Dianthui baric Ut in the woods of France, where it is indigenous, has smallish blood red flowers, without any of that beauti f ul variety common to it in gardens. A California judge is the possessor of a niirht Viooming cereus that is the largest of iu kind in the United States. It is thirty feet high, with branches that cover his house and porch nearly 250 square feet. The land is plowed in tbe foDowiuf manner: From ix to a dozen teams of oxen are put at work hi a single field of twenty or thirty acres. The oxen are "yoked" by tying a heavy beam aeroes their foreheads. To this beam the plow is attached, all the force being applied by the head instead of the shoulders. The plow is a crooked stick or branch of a tree, the point faced with iron. The Hebrews, when they tilled the soil in the time of Moses, had a plow made In the same way. Intelligent Peruvians contend th.-.t they do not need to plo more than two or three inches deep simply enough to loosen the soil so as to enable the awed to take root. The water used in irrigating is said to be rich in plant food, farther obviatinf tbe necessity of deep plowing. It may also be :d-d that improved plws, suitable fi1 liu country, aronowmanu facturcd in Europe and the United States, but it goes without saying that they are very different from the plow used by an American farmer. They are light and small, having a close re semblance to the original crooked stick. Another peculiarity of every Peruvian plow Is that it has only one handle. The driver carries in one hand a large goad, twelve or fifteen feet in length, with which to touch up his team, and ha manages the plow with the other hand.
