POLTROONS, OR WHAT? If the league members of the board of adminis­ tration expect to be taken seriously in their con­ tention that they are discharging C. E. Stangeland, the man who made the North Dakota state library a free love culture, merely because of a "malicious assault" made upon him by minority members of the house, and for the further reason "that poli­ ticians may not be able to divert the public mind from the great industrial program," then these men are craven cowards. If they regarded Stangeland a good and faithful servant if they agree with the Rev. George A. Tot ten that the books on free love and atheism which he had placed in the North Dakota public library had a place there if they regarded his alleged se­ lection of these books as fit reading matter for the rural youth of our land, then in the name of Heaven why weren't they men enough to stand back of their servant? :„5\.

DARE NOT IMPEACH Senator Ployhar put the thing in a nutshell when management dare not bring Attorney Gen- ^01 ^lc offenses which lie is alleged to have committed. Before the extra session convened there was a on other methods of depriving this authority. Without a direct charge one of thcse officials, thus leaving *10 "vvcre elected by the people to perform cer­ tain important duties deprived of the means of performing the work for which tjiey were elected. This is the method which has been chosen, and various bills have either been passed or arc under way whose sole purpose is, as Senator Ployhar said, to clip the wings of these men whose sole offense is that they have displayed a measure of independ­ ence and have declined to have their actions gov­ erned by thc dictates of Mr. Towrnlcy and his hired men. For this sort of thing no evidence is needed, not even a recital of facts. The majority is there, it has the votes, and it can deliver them. Impeach­ ment would be a different matter. Something in the way of formal charges would be necessary Without these even the form of impeachment by the house would not be considered, and when the proceedings reached the state of trial before the senate the men accused would be entitled to their defense, and could not be denied the opportunity to summon witnesses if they wished to do so. The proceedings must be public ami the record of an impeachment trial with all that transpired there would go before the people of the state. This would be exceedingly inconvenient to the bosses for there are a great many things in their career concerning which they would not desire the public to be in­ formed, and they are not taking the risk which would be involved in impeachment proceedings of having the records spread before the people and their corruption exposed. Therefore it is that in­ stead of impeachment in the open we have th gumshoe method of enacting bills prepared in se­ crecy, ordered passed by the secret eaitcufl, ant accepted in formal session witjwut serious consid­ eration of any kind.

FLINT'S VIEWS Vows and the Integrity of thc Family in Stirring Sunday Sermon A largo crowd gathered at the Evangelical church Sunday evening and listened attentively to the sermon by Rev. C. F. Strutz on the "Old Fashioned Home." The speaker took to exchange the sun. the creation of his text from Gen. JS: 19. "For I know Him t'nat He will command His chil­ dren and His household after Him, and1 they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He liath spoken of him." The recent agitation of the sub­ ject of the sacredness of the home caused by some startling statements cn the floor of the house of represen­ tatives, has suggested the theme and prompted this discussion, said Rev. Strutz. "It will hardly be necessary for me to state that I stand decidedly for the sacredness of thc home and marriage ties and am radically op­ posed to the thoories of 'free love,' advocated by certain radical social­ ists and1 other atheistic writers, but I have no desire to take sides in a purely political fight or to have my words used as political propaganda in a factional strife.

"Bible relig'on is not old-fashioned, any more than the smiling sun that' has brightened and cheered tlr's earth for thousands of years is old-fash­ ioned. or thc crackling /lire that warms our homes and makes this place of worship comfortable on this cold December night. You don't' want God, for a gas lamp, the device of man, nor give up the hot flame in the furnace for painted' fire. In like man­ ner I refuse to give up my faith in Jesus Christ, through whom I have salvation from sin, peace with God and victory in my soul, for the wild •guesses of higher critics and vague notions of conceited rationalists. "This old-time faith strengthened Abraham, caused Moses to triumph over all his difficulties, was the in­ spiration of Elijah and the comfort of Paul, who coui.-l say in view of the hangman's axe and the executioner's block, 'I am ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought thc good fight, have finished my course, I have kept thc faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.' "This was the faith of the founders of this nation.

Thc home problem is the greatest problem of our civilization. The homes of our country are as so many streams pour­ ing themselves into the great current of our moral, social and political life.
