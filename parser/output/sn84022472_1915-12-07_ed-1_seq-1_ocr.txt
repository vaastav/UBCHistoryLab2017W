TEUTON AND BLJLGARS AIMING AT MACEDONIA London, Dec. 7 The campaign against the main Serbian armies hav ing been closed, it is expected that Gen. Von Gallwitz, with his. German forces, will join the' Bulgarians in Macedonia in an effort to crush the French and British armies before they become much stronger. , ' Information from Berlin indicates that the German forces engaged in the 'earlier movements in the Balkans have now been detached for the pur pose, of sharing In the-- attack on the Franco-British forces along the south ern v, Macedonian front. ' Dispatches from Athens- partly corroborate this theory, as it is reported -that two Ger- man divisions are co-operating with the Bulgarians near Strumitza. ' There is little to report from the other fronts - except the usual minor operations.' The French, however, are carrying on a particularly energetic bombardment of the German lines in the , Champagne. In Mesopotamia the Germans are beginning to show con siderable Interest in the ' campaign, which is developing In favor of their Turkish allies. It is" reported from Geneva that the Germans under Field Marshal Von Der Goltz are prepar ing an extensive campaign which will be directed toward the Persian gulf by way of Bagdad. Further impetus Is given to peace talk by the Papal! consistory, at which Pope Benedict delivered an address calling upon the beligerents to make a just and immediate peace. The effect of the dismissal of the German military arr naval attaches in Washington on the Gerian public is not ascertainable yet, as the Ger man newspapers have not been per mitted to publish even the bare facts of the incident. ALLIES IX WAR. COUNCIL. j. Paris, Dec. 7 Another meeting of the general war council of the entente allies will be held here today. . Secretary Lansing Notifies Berlin That Boy-Ed and Von Papen Have Become Unsatisfactory Through Their "Naval and Military Activi ties" Further Exnlanation. Renuested Rv Berlin, is Denied Sources of Information Against Officials Will Noi Be Disclosed. -Washington, Dec. 7 Secretary Lansing has replied to-Ge-r-ipany that the American government's request for the "with drawal of Captain Boy-Ed and Captain Von Papen, the naval and military attaches, respectively the German embassy here, was entirely because of their military and naval activities. Secretary Lansing's reply to the German government's in quiry, which indicated the Berlin office intended to cjontestthe withdrawal of the attjaches finder certain conditions, was deliv ered in a long communication, which the German embassy im mediately forwarded to Berlin. V r At the embassy all comment on it was refused.- ' President Wilson lias fully approved Secretary Lansing's decision, and it was said authoritatively today that it will be adhered to 110 matter what Germany does'. '.- Neither was there any indication of whether the reply would meet the contention of the German -government, that it should know the reasons for the request for the withdrawal of its officers. . x . - It was broadly intimated to the state, department that if the request was based on something else than the developments of the Hamburg-American line cpnspiracy trial or the case of James F. J. Archibald, the American war correspondent who, secretly car ried despatches .- for Captain Von Papen, i, Germany would decline to withdraw either of the men. The general impression was , that Secretary Lansing's - reply at some lengths -repeats that the two officers have become persona p.oh grata be cause of their military and naval ac tivities "and that, further, under the diplomatic usages existing between na tions, it is unnecessary for one- gov ernment to do more than intimate to another that the presence of a diplo matic officer is distasteful. - ' . Overnight advices from Berlin indi cate that the German government would withdraw the . officers as ' re quested, although it might press for a bill of particulars. The position of the state department Is that it will not dis cuss the facts in the -case ' or reveal thesources of , its ;,inf qrmation which have led to the decision that the ac tivities of. the two German attaches make their presence in this country no longer desirable. j The department of justice is - still investigating reports - that ,: German agents were' back of alleged plans for a counter revolution In Mexico to be headed by General Huerta-r Attorney -General .Gregory said today, however, that' no new information on the sub ject had been called - to - his attention recently. . " One reason why the American gov ernment will not furnish Germany with specific reasons f or the request for the recall of Captain' Boy-Ed and Captain- Von Papen. Reports involv ing other men in this country are un der investigation and these the gov ernment does , not desire) to disclose until it Is ready to take further, action. Secretary Lansing also sent a repfy to Germany through Ambassador j Gerard at Berlin. In making its In-1 quiry, Germany also used two -avenues of communication, the German am bassador here and the American am bassador in Berlin. .' , ' ; , ' , While there was no indication to day . that the text of 'Secretary Lan sing's communication would be, made
