President Cleveland's meesage is a long one, but the importance of the subjects treated in it, justify a full statement, and tho force, directness and ability of the President's statement amply excuse tho length of the sage. The intelligence of tho Ameri can people will promptly recognize the President's patriotic spirit, and ap preciate the wisdom and convincing force with which this state paper dis cusses the country's foreign relations and the national iiuances. The first half of the message is de voted to an exposition of the relations of the United States to foreign pow and kindred subjects. It is satisfactory to great republic triving emphatic ap proval to the principle and practice of arbitration in international disputes. Arbitration means peace on earth.

Republican newspapers and politi cs have been asserting with some confidence that the is to bo found in tho deficiency of reve nue. They say that tho bonds were is d more to make up tho deficiency u to replenish the gold reserve, and that all trouble with the gold re serve would disappear if the treasury were filled to overflowing. The President shows the fallacy of this view, leave one shred of it clinging to another, lie also shows that the issue of bonds eta ot of the troub'.o thi His reasoning does not forced on all three occa sions when tho treasury had a comfort able surplus of other f< of money but was short of tho gold in which curroney must bo redeemed, figures in the following paragraph of the messag point: The are conclusive on this At no time when bonde havo been issued has there been uny consideration of tho question of paying the expenses of the government with their proceeds. Ihern was no necessity to consider that question. At the time of each bond issue we had a safe surplus in the treasury for ordinary operations, exclusive of the gold in our reserve. In February, 1894, when the first issue of bouds was made, such surplus amountod to over $18,000,000 ; in No vember, when tho second issue was made, it amountod to move than $42, - 000,000, and in February, 1895, when bonds for tho third time w issued, plus amounted to more thau 81U0,000,0U0. It now arounts to $98,073,420. Besides all this, the Secre tary of tho Treasury had no authority whatever to issue bnodsto increase the ordinary revenues or pay current ex penses. With unerring isdom the moBsage points Congress and the country to tho real trouble, and reveals i its ularming portent The trouble i in the treasury notes which the 6oniM detail govern ment is "forced to redeem without re demption and to pay ithout acquit tance." Tho treasury has outstanding notes amounting to nearly $500,000,000 which must be redeemed tat ion, and yet upon presen .'hen presented and paid the law says that "they shall not be retired, cancelled or destroyed, but they shall bo reissued and paid out again and kept in circulation." ■suit of this way of treating our currency is stated thus by tho President : Nearly $.'127,000,000 nf the K ohl thus withdrawn has been paid out United States notes, and yet every of the $346,000, (XX) is still uncalled ready to do these . .. , ,ie0 in future gold de pletions. More than $70,000,000'in gold has, since their creation in 1890, been paid out from tho treasury upon tho notes given on the purchase of pilvor by the government: and yet the whole, amounting to $155,000,000, excepting * htt \* more than $10,000,000, which hav ® been retired by exchanges for sil 7° r - "* ,h .\ reuu™t <'< uommen o.ru.

Should Congress respond to this declaration in the broad and patriotic spirit in which it is made thero should bo but little difficulty experienced in the settlement of our financial trials. If Congress be patriotic dent is know the Presi to be, the government Speaker Reed Btyled it, the vital question will not be, as "a divided one'' of finance. The President's message shows that ho is not "playing tho game of politics." Ho iB rather the patriot and statesman in office. Congressman Willis ot Tariff. Possibly if he learns in time of OongreHuman's peculiar fitness, Speaker Reed may put Mr. Willis and means committee, can hardly he expected to give Mr. Willis tho place his closo study of the tariff merits, at tho head of the mittee, but ho the ways Of course he ay squeeze him in somewhere towards tho tail end and thu9 give the committee the advantage of his sage counsel. Congressman Willis haR a definite tariff and that would bo a greatjhelp to the Republican leadors who are all at sea the tariff. The well matured viows of our Congressman were given as fol lows in yesterday's Philadelphia Press : "Wo must restoro the duty on wool and lumber, and tho McKinley schedules >lens, coal, wines, cigars, Scotch whisky, lino velvets, laces and silks, diamonds and agricultural products,and put an additional dollar a barrel inter venue tux on beer.

We have accordingly been proud of it and in dulgent to it. Considering we have been generous to a degree in appropriations for the support of thia institution. The State has in tended to make it a model of its kind; and the general impression has been that its management oism. The Philadelphia Inquirer's exposure of outrageous treatment of patients in our hospital for the insane, coming with charges that brutal murder lias been committed by trusted attendants patient in their guard and keep ing, falls like lightning from a clear sky. Naturally it has created great in terest throughout the State. Delaware will not patiently submit to the ill treatment of the poor defectives and unfortunates in her keeping, and her people are astounded to hear that such thiugs have been going on in Farn hurst. our mi above criti A I-, Nothing in tho exposure appears to re flect blame upon tho Board of Trustees. Tho members of that, board aro able, upright, conscientious citizens in whom tho people in tho communities in which they live havo reposed full flilence. Tho Inquirer's story doos not shako that confidence, beca porter's account of his stay in tho asylum shows that tho trustees have been taking wise and generous care of the institution. Reporter Synionds, who mitted con I Thomas West, Lord De La ^Varr, a follow afflicted with a delusion that he was tho old colonial captain general of Virginia who died at sea in 1618, found the hospital admirably ar ranged and in the boat of sanitary dition, with beautiful grounds laid out about it. It is well heated and lighted, the floors aud beds aro clean aud do cent. The food is good, wholesome and abundant. Evidently tho trustees doing their part towards making Farn hurst what Delaware intended it to be. The whole trouble lay in tho reckless brutality of Michael Lynch, a super visor, and Daniel Brown and John J. Swan, two attendants. Unless Reporter Symonds is utterly unreliable thero can be no doubt of the rough and heart less conduct of thoso three Keeper Oakes has a grievanco against them, aud if his word stood alone should take it with a grain of allow ance. But Mr. Svmonds says he saw and hoard things con U , re . Ex ith his •n oyes and oars ; and what ho saw and heard is enough and more than enough to prove that the throe men, against whom Oukes testifies, aro villainous keepers. He 'ports hammering with fists, throwing upon the floor, and beating with a stick. According to Dr. Ilancker's account of the condition of the heart of Pina—the man who is said to have been murdered—-Mr. Symonds saw people treated in a way that might have killed Pi6aat anytime. As to whether Pisa was murdered or not, we do not desire to opinion at this time, which must go befoi the jury leave it. But whet! was tho immediate c death, it is impoesiblo to doubt with the evidence now before tho public that thero has been heart rending brutality in tbe treatment of patients at Farn liurst. It may be that Pisa died of heart disoaso instoad of from cruel beating; but dead PiRa's heart trouble can not cover the blows and excuse tho kicks which Mr. Symonds witnessed. The brutal chargo of murder. Whether victod of that crir. take it express It is a question a jury and to jontented juRt ■ Iu • not brutality se of Pisa'« are in custody on the or acquitted, w that they will certai bo put in charge of our insane patients any more.

He went to tho north on invitation to open tho exhibition of wator aud F. Bayard, put in il puintings in Dundee, and the citizens took advantage of tho occasion to mark their appreciation of his character by presenting him, according to their quaint old custom, with the freedom of the city. Mr. Bayard made three addresses during thn day; ono, on International Amity, when he received tho freedom of the city : another, and Educative Effect of Art, opened tbe exhibition i Art Galleries; and the third before the Dundee Chamber of Commerce. Wo publish elsewhere two of the speeches be delivered. The citizens of Dundee give a very good and suggestive reason for their dosire to honor Mr. Bayard. Thoy say is in "recognition of his service to peace and commercial inter course between Great Britain and the United States, and in testimony of the high esteem and warm friendship enter tained by the citizens of Dundee for the American people." That is in full keeping with the pur and aspiration of Mr. Bayard's mission abroad, and shows that his efforts aro appreciated by tho Britishers by his own countrymen this side of the water. No man can have a higher mission than to cultivate peatfe and good will between two great aud civilized countries.

Dundee was kind enough to couple with its compliment to Mr. Dayard, n:i expression of high esteem aud warm friendship for tho American poople.

The gas company made complaint that the city was violating tho ag ment in allowing the lights to b_._ beyond the time prescribed in the agreement. It was shown that the morning the lights burned over the prescribed time was Monday morning, the occasion of tho robbery."
