THE ELKO 15DEPEKDENT. (ATIKIIU. DKIKMHKk |U. IK TO. ?? ?? ? r- V < ? x VKMBKMtCn Owr Vfrlarjr H? rmanrnl. Tbt- Republican journal* u( this State and of California since the ele ction have attempted n-jestwilv to pourtheboltn of conMation into the hearts of their friends. and while utrr admit that their defeat was only "retributive justice following swift upon the heels of vio lated law." They take new courage by telling ns that "we can no do it again:" "it is not a Democratic victory;" "the unfortunate awsociations o4 otrr guberna- I torial candidate caused our defeat." and such like empty declamations. To our Republican ' friends ar say. if such talk gives you hope it gives us no fear. Our victory over the Republican party is for all time. Othet combinations may arise in after years to cause the Democracy defeat. 1 but neither the principles nor the name of the late Republican party will enter into those combinations. Dead beyond a question, they have no spriukliug of truth with which to ?gain Its leading characters in the East, who made that party, more clearly see its doom, and have already subsidized a venal press to echo the cry of "Sew party," "Reform party" or some such terms with which to tickle the oars of the too credulous public. While the abandonment of the Republican party to its fate by such men as "Dirty Dv>g" Logan and that old devotee of Celestial per fection, Lyman Trumbull, is natural, and has been expected, we can not believe that their Call for a new party will meet with an appvrov- j ins response from the p?eople. lhe jeojJe j know the corruption of the Republican putty, and if it ever had any miss: n of good to per form, that mission by the declaration f tt leadrrs is ended and tt stands Uvw as a rv'.ic I of the past. * , How then is this to affect the Democracy ? The answer is cbvioua. The masses will re turn and remaiu with the tune-honored Dein ocracy, while the Radical leaders wiU go I searching after strange gods. We as a party ! have every element of perpetuity; our an cient name is dear to the hearts of the people. I?u.i lUirw^rui ut ? v a *-_?** *?,? ki*c C^OU X1?X1X?

The Sin Joaquin Republican, hi an article rrlati^i to the proposed undtinK works in Chicsgp. wry properly thai tb.?-e works should be construeWsl near- r the great center of ore supplies. Tbe Republican, how ever. falls into the nsual error of most of the California journals in supposing Sou Francisco to he that center. A moment's redectiou should dissipate that aiwamption. It will he found that only within the la<t two years, or since the construction <*f the 1'ccidc railroad. , has there been any practical reduction of ores by the smelting process, for the eery gocd reason that Vase metal or galena bearing ores had ao? in any quantity been discovered. The tirst general shipment of base bullion was from White Fine, since which time the discoveries of new districts of smelting ore hare been of almost daily occurrence. The distance on the line of the Fscific railroad m which such ores are found is about 5W miles, taking its western limit .-a Ore ana and its east ern at the mines near Salt Lake City. Sow, should extensive works be put up at SunFran cisco or Chicago, the owmrs of mines, or dealers in .res. would be snbjevtedin either in stance to the enormous expense of hundreds of miles of railr .H transportation. Prcui the eastern limit of the base metal region to Chicago is 1..V* miles and from its western limit to San Francisco is XX) miles- While the dtSrretikc in diatasw .? lexcly in f.ttur of sati Francisco, how much greater would be the gatn to lite miner if extensile smelting and separating w, rks were erwteO within the limits of the ngi.n above noted.
