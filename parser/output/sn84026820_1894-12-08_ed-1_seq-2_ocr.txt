There sre insane people who insist that they are perfectly sane, and that all the rest of mankind are mad. There are very many callow youths who es teem lightly the experience of age, and claim to "know it all." There are all-knowing men, who are so imbued with their own consequence, that their thick skulls are ever impervious to penetration by the light of reason. There are men who simply have no tions, and think they have ideas. But the truth remains that the in sane man is still insane. The youth is still callow. The self-esteemed and all knowing one still has his thick skull, (which is not backbone after all), and the man who mistakes notions for ideas is still without the needed brains with which togenerate the ideas. About eight years ago Grover Cleve land in his celebrated message, launch ed his notions on the tariff, of which a year before he confessed he knew but little. His party took up the cry, and with a mighty shout, followed the new flight. The campaigns "of education Commenced. The people were "hoo flooed." returned Mr. Cleveland to the White House and gave him a Congress of hflfco'wn «lection along with him. The rasuifc was, the panic of 1893 and the sickening business heartache of 1894, whtqh has cost the people of this country more money than did the civil war.. 1 But, Mr. Cleveland is not yet satis fied. The country has not yet been sufficiently disgusted by tariff tinker ing. H9 wants mare. And it is not enough to keep the people in a furore over the tariff, he and Mr. Carlisle have some more vagaries on the cur rency, which if permitted to be put into practice, will prove as disasterous as his tariff craziness. But so far, the people have not contemplated this late message with much seriousness, for it is not believed that the present Con gress, for the few weeks it will be in existance, will be able to agree on any thing. The people have settled down to a patient waiting for Mr. Cleveland's exit, and few tears will be shed when he goes. a as A bill to repeal the Income Tax law was the first to be presented to Congresss. Two ex-Governors expired on Tues day, Leon Abbett, of New Jersey and Oden Bowie, of Maryland. Governor Marvil will be inau garated at Dover January 15th, the fixed by the Constitution. The lulsture will assemble on Monday, January 6th. 16 Silver is speech but Silence is Gold." Mr. Cleveland evidently had this in mind when he preserved such remarkable silence on tlie recent elec tions in his last message. But there was really nothing for him to say, and he said it. We can truly say of the President's Message, "If its length benot its merit it hath no other. We presume, how ever, Prof. Wilson is pleased with it, Mr. Catching likewise, but the rest of the country receives it with apathy. It did not make any stir in Congress, and with the exception of a volley of condemnation from the press of the country it seems to be almost ignored. It i-' a very dull, humdrum, uninterest ing document, lacking either vigor or brilliancy, and so far as any distinctive originality is concerned it is not to be mentioned with the "perfidy and dis honor" letter. The President had a duty to perform and he did it in a very perfunctory manner. The Sunday opening of Saloons is being much discussed in New York City. The Devil seems a little harder to down in Gotham than in most places! After such an overwhelming victory for good morals and good government it is surprising that there should be such activity in favor of Sunday sell ing of liquor: Ministers are preaching against it hut some of the newspapers and many citizens are declaring in favor of it, pleading for the rights of the saloon men and their patrons, and declaring that because the present Excise law is not enforced, it is impracticable, and that lawful Sunday selling is belter than unlawful Sunday selling I But the sentiment that finds a lodgement in the most enlight ened minds and hearts is, dise the saloon not only on Sunday, but every day and the greatest foe to good govern ment and morality will be removed. It is certainly not to the credit of STew York City that many of her so-called leading men claiming to be reformers are favoring Sunday selling. The ex isting evils would be increased mani fold if t)>e present Exci. e law, irrprac« > Ü ticable as it is claimed to be, should be replaced with legalized Sunday selling, The liquor question is one of the vital questions of the hour. IIow to deal with it wisely and well is one of the must difficult problems this great na tion has to face. We are persuaded that the Dispensary law that has made the name of Governor Tillman, of South Carolina, to be known throughout the country, is a step in the direction of the final overthrow of the saloon. — / Our delinquent subscribers will please take note of the fact that wet are making an effort to collect all sub scriptions due us, and during the pres ent month shall endeavor to reach all oursubscriberseitherinperson,through our agents or by letter.

WASHINGTON DETTER. _ Washington, Dec. 3d, 1884:— I Congressis with us again! And a very much sadder and a somewhat wiser Congress it is than it was when it ad journed last August. One who saw the ending of tue last and the begin ning of the present session and who was entirely ignorant of the interme diate occurrences would not need to be told that something important had happened, and the faces of the Repub licans and Democrats would give him | an excellent clue to guess what that something was. Proportionate to their number there was a better attendance of Republicans in both House and | Senate than of Democrats. A witty Democratic member of the House per petrated the following just after the Democratic ^chaplain had concluded 1 his opening prayer: "I say," he said in a stage whisper, turning his head to wards the member seated next to him, "that fellow has an almighty poor memory." "Why?" asked the gentle- . man spoken to. "Why? Why great Scott! he omitted to say a word about the great November catastrophe, just as though the loss of $5,000 a year by such an awful lot of us was an insig- 1 nificant affair already forgotten. He' should have given us a word or two of religious consolation; we need it. The contemplation of the loss of his own job ought to have aroused his sympa thy. *• the warring factions of his party in Congress get together amicably, his wishes aie not made apparent by a bur ried reading of his message. On the contrary;the impression left upon one's mind is that he merely offers them a choice between accepting his views and being kicked out of the party, and that he doesu't care very much which they choose. Already liiere are mu'.

Verily the Fifty-fourth promises to be known in history as the sugar Congress; but I there seems to be no probability of anybody's getting punished, except the poor public. Tlie pour Senator Sherman does not as a rule bother himself about contradicting I newspaper stones in which he figures, bat he lost no time m informing the public that there was no truth in the statement that he helped Mr. Cleve land fix up the financial portion of his 1 be message. He doesn't care enough about ordinary misrepresentations to run them down, but lie draws the line at being charged w ith acting as financial the I adviser to Secretary Carlisle and Mr. na- Cleveland. He considers that an ex traordinaiy misrepresentation, the — Representative Cannon, of 111., isn't the a man of vindictive or revengeful na of ture, although when the occasion calls for them he can throw his share of / ora orial brick bats. When asked I whither the Republicans would during wet this session taunt the Democrats with their defeat, he said: -'If they show us their scarified backs and ask us to do all some rubbing 1 think we can find a little salt and water handy to touch up the the sore spots. However, what with their apologies and explanations and finding fault with Cleveland I do not us think the Democrats will give us a | chance to get in a word edgewise, The calibre of Mr. Cleveland's Cabi I net was never more forcibly demon strated than by the annual reports which the members, with the excep tion of Secretary Gresham who makes at no report, have submitted. Of course nobody expects any thing thrilling or | exciting iu these annual reports, but the public has a right to expect some thing better than the common place I woik which was put on them this year, There isn't a single department in which a score of minor officials could not be found who could—given the same facts to work on—produce in one | week's time better constructed and I have been signed by members of the | Cabinet.
