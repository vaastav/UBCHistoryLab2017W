PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE DE- LAYED. Washington. Nov. 29. Owing to his present affliction, the President will be unable to complete his annual message to Congress in time for sub mission to that body on the opening day of the session. The present ind ica tions are that he will be precluded trom making any progress whatever during the remaining days of the present week Consequently it is more than probable that the completion of the message will be delayed -until the end of next week or the beginning of the following week.

It will contain about 15,000 words. . 

THAT BIG BREWERY DEAL. Notwithstanding the Denials, it is Be lieved to Have Been Accomplished. St. Louis. Mo., Nov. 28 Notwith standing denials from Chicago and Milwaukee, there is a general feeling here that the proposed consideration of the largest four export breweries of the United States is a sure thing. While the local brewers cannot ac count for the statement of the Schlitz people in Milwaukee that there is noth ing in it, they call attention to the fact '.hat the denial from Chi ago by Presi dent Cooke, of the Cooke Brewing Company is of no effect. "The consolidation was to be one of the large -it four breweries manufactur ing beer for export," said a local brewer1 today, "while Mr. Cooke speaks only for these who brew for home consumption. The Rothschilds certainly would not care to back any local enterprise, but it can readily be understood that they would be inter ested in a scheme of such gigantic and far reaching proportions as that pub lished this morning." An evening paper here contains an interview with August Busch, a son of Adolphus Busch, on whose statement the published article was based, in which the son says he knows nothing about the proposed consolidation. TO STOP RAILROAD WRECKING. A Stringent Law Which Bids Fair to be Passed by the Georgia Legislature. Atlanta. Ga , Nov. 27. A great deal of consideration is being given by the people of Georgia to a bill intro duced in th House of Representatives of the Georgia Legislature by Mayor A. O. Bacon, of Bibb county. The bill is designed to prevent the wrecking of railroad property and pre scrnVs severe penalties for acts done with this purpose in view. " Mr. Bacon was for eight years Speaker of the House and is one of the m jst prominent men in the State. The probabilities are that if his bill passes the law will become a general one in the South. Every railroad in Georgia except three is m the hands of receiv ers. Railroad stocks, much of which is held by widows and estates through out, Georgia, bought at good nrices. have become" almost valueless in the last one or two years.TThe impression is prevalent that this has been caused in many instances by intentional wrecking operations and this belief is the reason for Bacon's bill, which in substance is as follows: Any act done by a director or officer of a railroad company with the design to wreck the railroad, by ! which act alone or in cor junction with other acts the railroad company is wrecked, is" made a felony punishable by con finement in the penitentiary for not more than twenty years or. by a fine not exceeding f 25.0C0 or by both. An act done with above design, but not successful in wrecking the com pany, is . made a felony, punished by confinement in the penitentiary for not exceeding ten years or by fine, not exceeding $10,000 or oy both. An act done by a director or officer of a company with intentio depress the value of the stock of the company is made prima facie evidence of intent to wreck the property. Any person not a director or officer of the company who conspires with a director or officer to do acts prohibited by the bill snail be punished to the sme extent as though a director or officer. It is said that there is a good prospect for the bill to become a law. A CRUEL BRUTE AT LARGE. Cows and Horses the Objects of His Vin dictiveness Columbus, Ohio, Nov. 29. For some months the local papers have contained at intervals accounts of cows killed by mutilation with a knife. Detectives have been unable to discover a trace of the perpetrator, but efforts were made to show in individual instances that the owners of the animals had by some means incurred the enmity of neigh bors and suffered a somewhat unnatu ral conseqnence It has gotten past tha stage, and the entire community is disturbed, as last :niht two cows and a valuable horse were horribly carved, and the horse and one cow are dead. The horse was in a 6ta'l of the stable at 383 Neil street, where the "ripper" cut a. gash in the abdomen, from which the entrails protruded, and cut off the animal's tail. The cows were attacked in the same manner, addi tional injuries being inflicted. Volun tary contributions are going into a fund to employ the best detective talent. No one has been able to explain the curious depravity of the brute, whose acts have extended over several months. The cow killed last night was owned by David Greene, eon of the late M. M Greene, President of the Hocking Valley Railroad, and Mr. Greene has offered $100 for the arrest and conviction of the man who killed her.
