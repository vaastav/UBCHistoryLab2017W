VOL. XXIII.-NO. 338. I Iff MII LITTLE BUSINESS TRANSACTED AT THE OPENING SESSION OF THE SENATE BiLusciiiM mm h SENATOR DOLLIVIfIt, THOUGH PRES ENT, DID NOT PRESENT HIS CREDENTIALS TRIBUTE PAID TO THE DEAD Chaplain Milbnrn Delivered a Touching: Eulog-y on the Late Senators Davis and ■ Gear. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—ln the senate today the work of the short session of the fifty-sixth congress was successfully launched. It had been the purpose of the senate to announce the deaths cf Senators Gear, of lowa and Davis, of Minnesota, immediately after assembling and then to adjourn and then receive the message of the president tomorrow, but as this had been announced by leaders of both branches to be a "business ses sion," it was determined to receive the message today and thus gain one day in a session when that much time may be of immense importance. Aside from the reading of the mes sage and the administration of the oath of office to W. B. Dillingham, the new senator from Vermont, who succeeds the . late Justin S. Morrill, no business was trans acted. The other new member 1 of the body, former Representative John P. Dolliver, who succeeds the late Senator Gear, of lowa, was present throughout the session, but his credentials were not presented and he was not sworn in. These formalities will "be completed to morrow, now that the senate has been informed officially of the death of Sen ator Gear. When the senate convened It was with in the shadow of death of two of Its most distinguished members. Since the senate last convened, a great national campaign has been inaugurated, and conducted to a conclusion, and as sen ators assembled they exchanged political greetings as well as the warm hand clasps of personal friendship. A notable meeting on the floor just before the ses sion opened was that between Mr. an na, of Ohio, and Mr. Jones, of Arkansas, the chairman, respectively, of the Repub lican and Democratic rational campaign committees. Surrounded by many of their colleagues they exchanged cordial greetings and laughed and chatted for several minutes. The air of the chamber was heavy with the perfume from magnificent floral pieces. 

TRIBUTE TO THE DEAD. Tire fall of Senator Five's gavel caused a hush to fali over the chamber at 12 o'clock, and then Mr. Millburn, the ven erable, blind chaplain, in a beautiful prayer, paid touching tributes to the deaths of Senators Davis and Gear. Tho call of the roll disclosed the pres et! »- of sixty-one senators, and the sen ate men proceeded to routine business. William B. D.Kingham was sworn in to fill the unexpired term of the late Justin S. Morrill. A solution by Mr. Hoar (Mass.), that a committee of sen ators be appointed to join a similar com mittee of the house to inform the presi dent that congress was in ses?icn and ready to receive any communication he might have to make, was adopts The .hair appointed Senators Hear and Cock ell. ' £•:: The senate, on motion of Mr. Hale, then took a recess of forty minutes, and on reassembling Mr. Hoar announced that the president had expressed his pleasure that congress once more was In session, and that he would communicate With it forthwith. -•>.-.. Instantly Maj. Pruden, one of the sec retaries to the president, was recognized, and presented the awaited message of the president. It took Mr. Beiin.tt, the secretary of the senate, one hour and fifty-four minutes to read it.. Mr. Allison then announced the death in July last of his colleague, Senator John Henry Gear, and offered the usual resolution of sorrow, which was adopted. Mr. Nelson (Minn.-), who had returned only, two hours before from St. Paul, announced formally the death of Sena tor Davis, saying that in his death "the nation has lost one of its wisest public servants, and the state of Minnesota one of its most distinguished sons." Then senate then, at 3:45 o'clock p. m. upon motion of Mr. Allison, as an addi tional mark of respect for the memories of Senator Gear and Senator Davis, ad journed. 

SENATORIAL PROGRAMME. The Republican senatorial committee on order of business this afternoon de cided the ship subsidy bill should displace the Spooner Philippines bill as unfinished business. It also considered at the same time the disposition of the Hay-Paunee fote treaty and decided that the.question would receive alternate attention with the shipping bill. The arrni-^pnt. pro vides that the shipping bill shall have preference, but that when no one is pre pared to make a speech on it the senate shall go into, executive session for the consideration of the treaty. In accordance with this understanding, Senator Frye at the first opportunity tol morrow will move to take up the bill, and if this motion prevails, as there is little doubt it will, the effect will be to displace the Spooner bill, which there is no disposition at this time to press Sen ator Frye- probably will make a speech. It is not expected that any other senator ■will be prepared to proceed on the sub sidy measure, and in that event Senator Lodge, of the committee on foreign re lations, who will have charge of the treaty, will move an executive session in order to consider the treaty. The arrangement further provides that if the army bill reaches the senate prior to ; the vdisposal of the shipping bill or the treaty, either or both of these may be displaced temporarily ln order to permit the prompt considera tion of that measure, which is considered to be of more pressing Importance than either of the other questions. The same understanding prevails regarding the ap propriation bills. Senator Morgan's Nicaraguan canal bill received some consideration at the hands of the committee on order of business. While no definite agreement was reached concerning it, the opinion was generally expressed that it should wait upon the senate's action for the treaty. The members of the committee apparently consider that the ratification of the treaty is a necessary preliminary to the passage of the canal bill, and the present disposition Is to contend for that order of precedence. The committee also discussed the pos sibility of Democratic opposition to the subsidy bill. Some of the members who Had talked with Democratic senators ex pressed tilic opinion that there would be no effort to prevent this legislation by factious opposition, though they expect a number of speeches against it.

It Provides for a Reapportionment Increasing: the House Member ship to 365—Minnesota ' Gains Two. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The «. opening of the session in the. house was brilliant, but not exciting. There 'were the usual throngs in the galleries, and the usual display of floral'pieces on the floor, but the proceedings were purely formal, con sisting of the rapping to order by the speaker, prayer by the chaplain, the roll call of members, the appointment of the formal committees to wait upon the president, and the reception and reading of the president's message. Despite the fact that a great presidential campaign had concluded within a month, the best of feeling seemed to prevail between Vic tors and vanquished. The reading of the message, which naturally was the feature of the day, occupied over two hours. It was listened to with respect ful interest by both sides. The deaths of the late Representatives Daly (N. J.) and Hoeffecker (Del.), and Senators Da vis (Minn.) and Gear (Io.), were an nounced, and as a further mark of re spect to their memories the house ad journed until tomorrow. , . When Speaker Henderson called the house to order at noon the desks of half the members were freighted with flowers from admiring friends or constituents, and. the profusion of the floral pieces gave the vast hall more the apearance of a garden than a legislative assembly. The floral pieces were of infinite varie ty. Roses, carnations and. chrysanthe mums of every hue were made into every conceivable design. The greater proportion of the flowers was cj.r the Re publican side, and one could mark the geographical limits of. "the party in the recent campaign by the flowered area. They usually marked the seat of one who had won a personal triumph. In the galleries the wealth and beauty cf the capital was present gowned in smart winter frocks. A rap with a gavel from £!peaker Hen derson commanded the assemblage on the floor and gallery to remain quiet, and then |the blind chaplain referred feelingly' to the deaths of the late Rep resentatives ..Daly, of New Jersey, and Hoeffecker, of Delaware, which occurred during the recess. The speaker then directed the clerk to cad the roll. As soon as the clerk began the con versation on the floor and in the gal leries was resumed. The conversation became so great that the clerk could not hear the responses, and the speaker was obliged several times to call for order. The speaker announced that-275 mem bers had responded to their names a quorum, and the house was ready for business. The following then- appeared at the bar and took the oath: Albert D Shaw, who succeeds the late Represent tative 'kerin^ of New York; Allen F. Mc-Denmott, who success the late Representative Daly, of New Jersey: Walter O. Hoeffecker. who -succeeds tme late Representative. Hoeffecker. of Dela ware; Edward de V." Morrell, who suc ceeds the late Representative Harmer Pennsylvania; Wm. Richardson, who suc ceeds Gen. Joe Wheeler, of Alabama; W a. Jackson, who succeeds Gov. Smith of Maryland; Samuel D. Woods, who suc ceeds Representative D. Vrie-' of Cal ifornia. ." . • .-*". 01 al" Mr. Bailey, of Texas," questioned the ££? rv V c re T s T^ nation of Representa tive Dolliver. He said- he doubted the right of a member to resign, at a future fixed date. lie said he would not raise the Point formally, but. merely called the attention to it so that in the future it could not be used as a precedent. Mr. Dolhver's resignation, he said had been tendered to take effect De- 1 so that Mr. Conner had been elected to' fill a vacancy, which did not exist at the time of the ejection. He cited a de cision to show that a resignation to take effect at a future date was not a resig nation in fact, but simply a notification of a resignation to be made in the future. Mr. Bailey said he did not desire to press the matter, but desired the protest to be filed.  . The speaker stated that* inasmuch as objection had been made, Me. Connor would step aside until the protest had been disposed of. The speaker announced the appoint ment of Mr. Eabcock, of Wisconsin on the committee on ways and means to succeed Mr. Dolliver. Messrs. Payne (Rep., N. V.); Gros venor (Rep., O.) and Richardson (Dem Term,), were appointed to join the com mittee of the senate to notify the presi dent that congress was in session and ready to receive any^ommunication from him. The clerk was also directed by resolu tion to notify the senate that the house was ready to do business. After the adoption of these formal resolutions the house at 1 o'clock took a recess until 2 o'clock, when the president's message was listened to attentively. The reading occupied two hours and ten minutes. There were no demonstrations during the"reading, but as' the clerk finished, there was a scattering round of applause on .the Republican side. The deaths of the late Representative Hoeffecker, of Delaware; the late Rep resentative Daly, of New Jersey; the late Senator Geor, of lowa and the late m ator Davis,' of Minnesota were then an nounced and after the adoption of reso lutions of regret, the house as a further mark of respect, to .the memory of thi deceased statesmen, at 4:20 p. m ad journed. - '"".'

Decision Was Unanimous, Though the Justices Did Not Agree as to Their Grounds . Therefor. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The supreme court has knocked out the Anderson law on constitutional. grounds. The case is remanded Tor a new trial in Steams county. V The decision is a victory for the North ern Pacific, the St. Paul & Duluth and subsidiary lines, but does not include the Great Northern. The court was unanimous. The case came to this court on error to the supreme ;court of the state of Min nesota. It was brought up at the in stance of certain railroad companies, and involved the question of whether real es tate belonging to them not used in the operation of their roads is subject to tax ation according to its value, or is ex cepted by virtue of a contract-alleged to have been made several years ago through legislation by the state, providing that- railroad companies should pay 3 per cent on their gross earnings in lieu of taxes on all property. The taxes of the St. Paul & Duluth railway company were immediately in volved in this case. The case also included the question of the validity of the Minnesota law of 1895, repealing the ro"rmer contract law and seeking to separate the lands of rail roads from their other property for pur poses of taxation, still retaining the 3 pe r cent tax on gross earnings. ACT IS WORTHLESS. The effect of today's opinion is to hold the law of 1805 invalid. In passing upon the case the court held that the state had been admitted to the sisterhood of states under the usual cm pact, and that as long as the title of its lands remains .in the United States' tho ?e lands are exempt from taxation. So far as the land involved in this case is con cerned, it was stated that it had been granted to the state by congress and by the slate to the St. Paul & Duluth com pany. Soon afterwards, the justice con tinned, the state had enacted legislation providing that railroads in the state should pay 2 per cent on their gross earn ings, in lieu of all other taxes upon their property. The opinion by Justice Brewer sustain ed the view that the original legislation was in the nature of a contract, which was binding and which could- not be in validated by the act of 1895, seeking to repeal it. This latter act, therefore, was pronounced repugnant to the federal con stitution and void In this respect. Justices Harlan, Gray, Brown, White and McKenna concurred In the result, but did not agree with their colleagues as to the grounds on which the conc"us;on was reached. Justice Brewer read the decision. OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. C. W. Bunn, attorney for the Northern Pacific railway, was seen last night by a reporter of the Globe, and in refer ence to the above dsclsion, said: "It is a long story, and I cannot new go into the history of the case as fully as I would like to. It has been a most important case, one involving a very large sum of money, and the supreme court of the United States has sustained the position taken by the railroad com panies interested, the Great Northern and the St. Paul & Duluth, on every point at issue. "What Is known as the Anderson law was first brought before the state legis lature under the name of the Markham bill in 1893. It was defeated at that ses sion, but two years later was re-introduc ed by August Anderson, of Chisaem coun ty, and was passed In the house. Th - sen ate also passed it by a majority of one vote and at the next election it was en dorsed by the pople. The railway com panies party to the action just derided, never paid the money due under the as sessments provided for in the new law." It so happened that the bill passed the senate by. this scant majority after Sen ator Frank A. Day had succeceded to the presidency of the senate on the pro- FlErfplSlf''M'lJßPEll lf4 A 

PALLAS S TEX.j SALOOtf DALLAS, Tex.. Dec. Screams of agony brought policemen to a saloon in East Dallas early this morning. Seated in a chair, unable to move, was a man whose garments were a mass of flames. The officers say Eugene Faulkner and J. W. Chapman were standing behind. the bar, smoking cigars and watching the unfortunate man, who was being roasted to death. "Bring some water here, quick!" shouted an officer. "Get it your self," the policeman declared one of the men rertoted. g "Let him die; what's the use of worrying over him?" One of the officers took off his coat and with it beat" out the- fire. The man was sent to the city hospital, where he died within a few hours. Soon after his arrival at the hospital the two men who-were In the barroom were brought before him for identification. Then it was that the discovery was made that his eyes had been burned: out. He was Pate Bain, for many years a constable at Garland, GE^MAJ^J EXFEpITioM BERLIN.

Clough to succeed Senator Knute Nelson as-governor. When the next election rolled around and the contention was raised that Day had forfeited his seat in the senate by becoming lieutenant governor, ; although only one half of his four years' N «enatoiial term had expired,' it was insisted by many that this was the first step in an effort to break down the Anderson law by contesting the regularity of its passage, Day having been one of those who voted for it, and without whose vote is would have been .lost on a tie. The legislature unseated Day under the whip hand of .the Rpublican state central committee, although his ostensible griev ance was his leaning toward tree silver rather than his altitude on this bin. ■ The courts, however, later declared his unseating unwarranted, and he was re imbursed for his expanses in defending his right to a seat in .the senate during the session of lSi'7. That summer litiga tion was begun. Mr. Burin say's: 

GREAT NORTHERN NOT TN IT. "Fred Steams, auditor of Aitkin county, left out two pieces of railroad land from the tax rolls, and the'then attorney gen eral, Childs, commenced mandamus pro ceedings to have the land placed back on the tax rolls. The matter came before Judge Holland at Brainerd, and he grant ed the write. > "The case was next taken to the su preme court, cf the; state, where Judge Holland's decision 'was affirmed. Then' proceedings in error were instituted in the supreme court at -Washington,' "and. to make a long story short, that court has decided in favor of the. railways, and by virtue of this last decision, the And erson law is quashed, a; being uncon stitutional.-. •_' - ■--.; "The companies immediately interest ed in this decision, c, re the Northern Pa cific and the St. S Paul & Duluth. Other roads are also interested, but they are not parties to the.present suit." "How much would-we have had to pay if the decision had been the other way?" "The lands "formerly, owned '-by. the St. Paul & Duluth- have also been sold, but In the event of an adverse decision, the state would have had probably $200,000 coming. "I said before that tihe Great Northern was not concerned in this decision. This is true, but at the same time it has a better case than had we. Most of the land grant of the - Northern Pacific was obtained under an act of 1565, while that of the Great Northern was granted under previous acts of territorials days, and the contract held by that company exempting its lands from special taxation is, I think, confessedly a good contract. "There are other companies which. will welcome today's decision, for all the money that has been paid by any of them is now known to have been paid under the provisions of a law that is unconstitutional. - j "What the Washington court has done amounts to declaring that the Minnesota legislature had no power , to pass such a law as the Anderson law. The condi tions under which, the grants were made originally are safeguarded by the "con stitution of the. United States and cannot be violated by the legislature.." . The case has been argued' before the supreme .court at Washington twice; once last spring, when a rehearing of . the case was ordered, and on Oct. 15 last. Mr. Bunn and Mr. Hornblower, of New York, appeared r for the- railway com panies, and Attorney General Douglas and ex-Attorney General Childs for the state. . in this country. It is claimed by the officers that Bain was drugged, and as he reclined in a chair, unconscious, a quantity of -turpentine was poured over him and a.match applied. The man was literally coasted. When the heat and pain partially revived him, he called pite ously : for help, and when no one came, he screamed and - attracted .'the offi cers, i When neves of the outrage became widespread,: the greatest indignation j was expressed. The two suspects were put in the city:jail and guarded by deputies. Tonight a mob of uffflen ' or -twenty men called at the jail and demanded the pris oners of the -jailer.

Your countrymen will join with you in felicitation that American liberty, is more firmly established than ever before, and that love for it and the determination to preserve it are more universal than at any former pe»od of our history. The republic was never so strong, be cause never so strongly intrenched in the hearts of the people as now. The con stitution, with lev amendments, exisis as it left the hands of its authors.

Causes of the Uprrsing and the Dip- lomatic Status. In our foreign intercourse the dominant | question-has been the-treatment of the j Chinese problem. Apart from this our re- ; lations with the powers have been hap- ! py. -. -*'•"■ The recent troubles .in China spring I from the a»tiforeign agitation which for? the past three years has gained strength ! in the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep. in the character of the Chinese races and in the traditions of their gov ernment; - The .Taiping srebellion and the opening of Chinese ports to "foreign-trade and settlement disturbed alike the homogeneity and the seclusion of China. Meanwhile foreign activity, made itself felt', in all quarters, .not alone on the, :' coast, but along the great river arteries ' and in . the remoter districts, carrying hew ideas and introducing new associa- ! tions among a primitive people which had pursued for centuries a national! policy of., isolation.' ... \ The telegraph and the'railway spread-, ing over their land, the steamers plying on their waterways, the merchant and the missionary penetrating year by year farther to the interior, became to the Chinese mind types of an alien invasion, ; changing the course of their national life and fraught with vague forebodings j of disaster to their beliers and their self- ; control. For several years before the present \ troubles all the resources of foreign diplo- i macy, backed by moral dominations and physical force of fleets and arms, have been needed to secure due respect fur the treaty rights of foreigners and to obtain satisfaction from . the responsible authorities for the sporadic outrages up on the persons and property of unoffend ing sojourners, which from "time to time occurred at widely separated points in the " northern provinces, as in the case of the outbreaks in Szechuen and Shan- I tung. - Posting of antiforeign placards became I a daily occurrence, which the repeated ; reprobation of the imperial nower failed ! to check or punish. These inflammatory i appeals to the ignorance and supersti- i tion of the. masses, mendacious and ab- I surd in their accusations and deeply hos- '■ tile in their spirit, could not but work i cumulative harm. They aimed at no ' particular class of foreigners; they were ' , impartial, in attacking everything for- j eign. An outbreak in Shantung, in which Ger- ' man missionaries were slain, was the i too natural result of . these malevolent i teachings. The posting of -seditious pla- j cards, exhorting to the utter destruc tion, of foreigners and of every foreign thing, continued, unrebuked. Ho«ti'e demonstrations toward the stranger gain- I ed strength by organization.
