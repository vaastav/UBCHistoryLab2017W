'"Yes sir,' the servant answered. "The major, dressing for dinner that night, said again: 'I suppose, James, that you did as 1 told you about those boots?' "James laid 35 cents on the bureau. 'Yes, sir,' said he, 'and this is all I could get for them though the cor poral who bought 'em said he'd have given half a dollar if pay day hadn't been so far off.'" Unearthing the Briber. During a recent campaign in Eng land a certain woman called on a la borer's wife and asked if her husband would /vote for Lord Blank. "No, he won't," was the reply. "But, remem ber 'the blankets and coals you got I from the clergyman." "Never mind them. He's been promised anew pair of trousers if he votes for Mr. Dash." Suspecting. that this was a case of bribery that must be outdone, the woman canvasser offered a sovereign If the woman would tell her who had promised the trousers. The money paid over, the woman smiled. "I I promised them," she said, "and I'll buy them out of your sovereign." NO MEDICINE. But Change of Food Gave Final Relief.

Bead the bop*, "The Road to WellvillV "si Washington.—President Roosevelt's message, describing conditions in Por to Rico, and making recommendations for legislation he believes necessary, was read to the congress. It is as fol lows: To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: On November 211 visited the Island of Porto Rico, landing at Ponce, cross ing by the old Spanish road by Cayey to San Juan, and returning next morn ing over the new American road from Arecibo to Ponce the scenery was wonderfully beautiful, especially among the mountains of the interior, which constitute a veritable tropic Switzerland. 1 could not embark at San Juan because the harbor has not been dredged out and can not receive an American battleship. I do not think this fact creditable tf» us as a nation, and I earnestly hope that im mediate provision will be made for dredging San Juan harbor. I doubt whether our people as a whole realize the beauty and fertility of Porto Rico, and the progress that has been made under its admirable government. We have just cause for pride in the character of our represen tatives who have administered the tropic islands which came under our flag as a result of the war with Spain and of no one of them is this more true than of Porto Rico. It would be impossible to wish a more faithful, a more efficient and a more disinter ested public service than that now be ing rendered in the island of Porto Rico by those in control of the insular government. I stopped at a dozen towns all told, and one of the notable features In every town was the gathering of the school children. The work that has been done in Porto Rico for education has been noteworthy. The main em phasis, as is eminently.wise and prop er, has been put upon primary educa tion but in addition to this there is a normal school, and agricultural school, three industrial and three high schools. Every effort is being made to secure not only the benefits of ele mentary education to all the Porto Ricans of the next generation, but also as far as means will permit to train them so that the Industrial, agri cultural and commercial opportunities of the Island can be utilized to the best possible advantage. It was evi dent at a glance thitt the teachers, both Americans and native Porto Ricans, were devoted to their work, took the greatest pride in it, and were endeavoring to train their pupils, not only In mind, but in what counts for far more than mind in citizenship, that Is, In character. I was very much struck by the ex cellent character both of the insular police and of the Porto Rican regi ment. They are both of them bodies that reflect credit upon the American administration of the island The in sular police are under the local Porto Rican government. The Porto Rican regiment of troops must be appro priated for by the congress.

Last year, therefore, there was double the trade that there was In the most prosper ous year under the Spanish reglwo. There were 210,273 tons of sugar ex ported last year, of the value of $14, 186,319 $3,555,163 of tobacco, and 28,290,322 pounds of coffee of the value qf $3,481,102. Ur fortunately, what used to be Porte Hieo's prime crop—• ooffee—has not shared this prosper ity. It has never recovered from the disaster of the hurricane, and, more over, the benefit of throwing open our market to it haa not compensated for the loss inflicted by the closing of the markets to it abroad. I call your attention to the accompanying memo rial on this supject of the board of trade of San Juan, and I earnestly hopo that some measure will be taken for the benefit of the excellent and high grade Porto Rican coffee. There ts a matter to which I wish to call your especial attention, and that is the desirability of conferring full American citizenship upon the people of Porto Rico. I most earnest-, ly hope that this will be done. I can not see how any harm can possibly re sult from It, and it seems to me. a mat-j ter of right and justice to the people' of Porto Rico. They are loyal, they are glad to be under our flag, they axe, making rapid progress along the path* of orderly liberty. Sutely we should) show our appreciation of them, our pride in what they have done, and! our pleasure In extending recognition^ for what has thus been dotre, by grant ing them full American citizenship. Under the wlBe administration of the. present governor and council, marked) progress has been made in the difficuU matter of granting to the people of the: island the largest measure of self-gov ernment that can with safety be givent at the present time. It would have, been a very serious mistake to have! gone any faster than we have already gone this direction. The Portoi Ricans have complete and absolute autonomy in all their municipal gov-i ernments, the only power over them) possessed by the Insular government: being that of removing corrupt or in-, competent municipal officials. This) power has never been exercised savej on the clearest proof of corruption or of incompetence—such as to Jeopar-j dize the interests of the people of the. island and under such circumstances it has been fearlessly used to the im mense benefit of the people. It is not a power with which it would be safe.j for the sake of the island itself, to dis-j pense at present. The lower house is, absolutely elective, while the upper house is appointive. This scheme is working well no injustice of any kind results from it, and great benefit to the island, and it should certainly not be changed at this time. The machin ery of the elections is administered en tirely by the Porto Rican people them selves, the governor and council keep ing only such supervision as is neces sary in order to insure an orderly elec tion. Any protest as to electoral frauds is settled in the courts. Here again it would not be safe to make any change in the present system. The elections this year were absolutely orderly, un accompanied by any disturbance and no protest has been made against the, management of the elections, although three contests are threatened where the majorities were very small and error was claimed the contests, of course, to be settled in the courts. In short, the. governor and council are co operating with all of the most enlight» ened and most patriotic of the people of Porto Rico in educating the citizens of the island in the principles of order ly liberty. They are providing a gov ernment based upon each citizen's self respect, and the mutual respect of all citizens that is, based upon a rigid observance of the principles of justice and honesty. It has not been easy to Instill into the mind3 of people unac customed to the exercise of freedom the two basic principles of our Ameri can system the principle that the ma jority must rule, and the principle that the minority has rights which must not be disregarded or trampled upon. Yet real progress has been made in having these principles accepted as elementary, as the foundations of suc cessful self-government. I transmit herewith the report of the governor of Porto Rico, sent to the president through the secretary of state. All the insular governments should be placed in one bureau, either in the department of war or the department of state. It is a mistake not so to ar range our handling of these islands at troops'1hi^the 'TslanT and"it is" wise Washington as to be able to take ad that these troops should be themselves 1 native Porto Rfcatis It m'd be from every standpoint a mistake not to perpetuate thi3 regiment. antage of the experience gained in one, when dealing with the problems that from time to time arise in an other.
