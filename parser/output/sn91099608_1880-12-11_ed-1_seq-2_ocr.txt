fail!) ftt# anil galtirtaix* f|v 8ATUBDAY, DECEMBER11,1880. Representative Kelley, ol Pennaylva nia, has prepared a substitute for the I refunding bill, now pending before con gress. It provides that the secretary the treasury shall be authorized to issue notes to the amount of $400,000,000 of denominations not less thau $100, bear ing interest at a rate not exceeding three per cent per annum, redeemable at the pleasure of the United States, after one year, and payable in ten years from the date of issue, but not more of said notes shall be redeemed in any one fiscal year than the amount of the sinking fund for that year, and the particular notes to be redeemed from time to time Bhall be de termined by lot under such rules as the secretary of the treasury shall prescribe. This will be offered by Representative Kelley as a substitute when the Wood refunding bill is called up. A meeting of the citizens of Fargo was held last Monday night at which it was agreed that the division of Dakota was desirable upon the seventh standard parallel and the conclusions of the meet ing were forwarded to Delegate Bennett, The seventh standard parallel is the dividing line between the counties of Bamson and Day, La Moure and Brown, Logan and McPherson and Emmons and Campbell. By making this the bound ary line between the two sections no change would be necessary in county lines. Dividing the territory upon the proposed forty-sixth parallel, which lies about five miles north of the seventh standard parallel, would place five sixths of the lower tier of townships in Emmons, Logan, LaMoure, Ransom and Richland counties in southern Dakota and the balance of these counties in northern Dakota. It would not only cause an inconvenient patching up of townships, but would cut in twain numerous farms, placing a fragment in each of the states that are to be. These are the causes which impel the people of Fargo to desire division upon the seventh standard parallel. The following item, sent out from Washington as an associated press tele gram, is causing some anxiety among the people of the north: Delegate Bennett introduced a bill to-day to admit Dakota as a state. The bill provides also for the division of the territory, making the boundaries of the proposed new state to include that portion of the present territory lying south of the forty-seventh degree of north latitude. It can hardly be doubted that the agent of the associated press made a mistake in writing the number of the parallal which it is proposed to make the line of division, and that Delegate Bennett's bill names the forty-sixth in stead of the forty-seventh parallel. The Fargo Argus, the exponent of northern sentiment, is inclined to take this view of it, though it has its suspicions, as can be seen from the following paragraph from its columns: The 47th parallel runs a little north of Fargo and Bismarck. Can it be possible that it is pro posed to tack these cities and the line of the Northern Pacific railroad to the tail of south ern Dakota's kite, and cut ns off from our friends of the northern counties? The Argus trusts that a mistake has been made in trans mitting the report, and refrains from saying anything further until the news shall nave been corroborated or otherwise. There are features about the movements accompanying this latest admission scheme which suggest watchfulness on the part of our people, ni ted and rapid action will protect the interests of north Dakota now indifference might lead to results that would be regretted, perhaps, when too late. Without any actual knowledge upon the subject, it is our firm belief that Delegate Bennett's bill does not con template any such division as the tele graph credits him with. He fully understands the wishes of the people and is not the man to act in opposition thereto. There is no class of officials appointed by the president who are more inade quately paid than the judges sent out to administer law and justice in the popu lous territories. Each has his special field of labor and must conduct courts in various counties of his district and in ad dition must hold two general semi-annu al terms of the United States court for his entire district. Then as often as twice each year these judges come to gether as the supreme court of the terri tory and go through with seasons of la borous mental work and research. For all this they have' been receiving the modest recompense of $2,600 per annum, or less than one-half the money return their legal attainments would bring them in the Bame field as practicing attorneys. Taking our own (the second) judicial district as a sample of the rest, it can be readily seen that territo rial judges as a class give double the yalue of their recompense in solid work upon the bench. From one year's end to the other one court or an other is almost constantly in session and the presiding judge is expected to take time between two days to Bearch author ities, and prepare eleborate and correct opinions which shall go down to posteri ty as the law of the land. There are brief intervals between court sessions, it is true, but they are exceedingly brief and not at all numerouH. Instead of be ing seasons of rest and recuperation, they are devoted to severe mental labor by which the presiding judge hopes to dippose of the work which has accummu lated and be ready to begin anew upon matters to be developed within the court room. During the coming fiRcal year territorial judges will receive, probably, salaries of $3,000, but this is too little by abont $2,000. Lawyers of their standing can readily secure a practice worth $5,000 per year and there is no good reason why the government should not pay them what they are worth.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. A Stalwart Republican Newspaper's Opln Ion of It. Chioago Inter-Oeean. ., The last annual message of President Hayes wsubmitted to oongress yea teraay. and is printed in full in to-day Inter-Ooean. The paper is longer than usual, but is of more than ordinary in terest, owing to the fact that many of the questions tonched upon are iu the debatable stage, and find advooates and opposers among men of both parties. In a literary sense the present message is perhaps a less admirable dooumeut than some of the president's previous papers but in other respects it is super ion It is more praotical in its sugges tions, less objectionably in it* recommen dations, and breathes throughout a spirit of sobered and well tempered judgment, in pleasant contrast with the rather self oomplaisant and over confident tone which characterized his early utterances, and which enabled one to read between the lines the assuranoe that we had at lost got a president who would correct all evils, reform all abuses, and give the American people an administration worth having. After all, there is no teacher like expe rience, no school like that where the dif ficulties of human endeavor and the ob stacles to human progress come home to a man from aotual knowledge gained iu the conflict of practical, every-day life. To the looker-on in this world, great deeds seem easy of accomplishment, and perfection in government seems only a matter of will and authority. To the participant, striving in the midst of the turmoil to gain the ideal point, nothing appears more difficult and naught so childish as the views of the ideal ist. To our mind, the message of President Hayes reveals j»n advance ment on his part away beyond the point occupied by him at his inauguration. His views are broader, his vision wider, his charity greater, and his vanity less. Fools will not gather wisdom from expe rience great men do, and tl fact that Mr. Hayes profited by the schooling of his presidential term is in itself a recom mendation. He never was so fit to be president as now, when he is about to toy down his office. The message begins with a reference to the disfranchisement of colored citi zens in the south, and does not, as the synopsis published yesterday would lead the reader to suppose, "express satisfac tion with the outlook of affairs in the southern states." On the contrary, he deeply deplores the reign of fraud aud tissue ballots which have "been success ful in defeating the exercise of the right preservative of all rights, the right of suffrage, which the constitution express ly confers upon our enfranchised citi zens." The president truthfully says that the failure to observe the amendments to the constitution is "all that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sec tional lines in our political con tests" and he no longer seems to enter tain the hope that an appeal to the pa triotism and gratitude of southern poli ticians will bring abont this millennium. On the contrary, he expresses* the hope that congress will see to it that no mem ber of eitner house gains a seat by rea son of violation of the letter and spirit of the fifteenth amendment, and declares his purpose, if he shall receive the neces sary aid from congress, "to prosecute unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights guar anteed to them by the constitution." While the Inter-Ocean manifests its sat isfaction with the message on this point, it cannot but express its regret that the first document ol the kind sent to con gress by Mr. Hayes did not show equal clearness and decision upon this subject. There will be some objection to and probably some ridicule expended upon hat part of the message devoted to the subject of civil service reform. It is not to be expected, however, that the presi dent will abandon a favorite principle simply because he has found it impracti cable of enforcement during his term of office. The theory of civil service reform has many features to commend it, and when Gen. Cfrant first suggested legisla tion upon the subject ne was himself quite sanguine that a reform could be instituted without much difficulty that would be most beneficial to the public service. There are many obstacles in the way of success, however, and one of the chief of these is the failure of the dem ocratic party to observe any part of the principle wherever they are successful, though they never fail to urge its adop tion upon republicans. When that party succeeded to power in the senate and house, such a wholesale discharge oi hon est and capable men was instituted as to naturally excite a spirit of retaliation and a determination to postpone all rad ical reform in this direction until democracy was forever relegated to defeat. No one doubts that, hail the democrats succeeded at the late election, the whole patronage of the government would have been used to strengthen and perpetuate their tenure, and, with such a foe to contend with many republicans believe it dangerous to grant any favors, even though the principle may be right and the service would he, in individual instances, benefitted by the "reform," There are many other things pro and con to say about the practical workings of this theory, and many questions just now before the people which are, in the opinion of the Inter Ocean, of more pressing importance that progress can be made, however, in the direction of giving merit precedence of mediocrity and mere political service, we think most probable, and the remarks of the presi dent oan therefore be accepted with can dor, and should be treated with respect ful consideration.
