A correspondent of the New York Tribune, writing from the department of the West, s&js that the Emancipation Proclamation is already having its effect in the preparations which the slare owners of Alabama and Tennessee are making for their future relations to their slaves. Many of them have already entered into a oontraot with their slaves to remain upon the plantations under vagtt. They have eame to the conclusion that the slaves are as necessary to them as it has long been asserted they were to the slaves. As la borers, the slaves are essential to the pros- parity of the South, and no class will be more opposed to their colonization in a foreign country, when the war is over, than their former masters. It has long been manifest that there was a far greater prej udice existing sgainst association with the negro at the North than at the South. There, the two races have been intimately connected from childhood, a fact of which the quadroon and the octoroons are living witnesses. Hence there will be less social resistance to them as free persons there than at the North. The fact that the negro Is especially adapted to the cultivation of the Southern soil under the Southern climate, is perfectly understood by the master and hence it is that they are ne gotiating with the Blaves to remain as pud laborers and do the work to which they have been accustomed. Several instances are noticed by the correspondent, where this arrangement has been effected. One Mr. Aiken, a cotton planter of Tennessee, said to him that he and several of his neighbors" had already had a talk with their slaves and agreed with them to remain and receive wages. They preferred them to any new set of la borers that they could obtain. They had advised their slaves to remain and they were pleased with the arrangement. Other instances are narrated, sufficient to show that the movement is spending. There are, no doubt, many Northern Democrats who will see, even in this peace ful negotiation, an "unconstitutional policy " tut all those who earnestly desire the welfare of the oppressed of the human race will see in it one solution of the great problem "what shall be done with the laves?" Departure of General Banks' Expedition. The military expedition which has been fitting ont under the command of General N. P. Banks, sailed from New York on Thursday, the commander himself taking passage in the steamer North Star. A part of the troops to composcJhe force under this command have been Andetvousing at Fortress Monroe, and it is supposed that the Massachusetts troops which lately ailed from Boston to North Carolina are also to have a place in this expedition. On Thursday an excursion was given in Kew York harbor in honor of General Banks, at which many distinguished citi tens were present. A dinner was served on board, and brief speeches followed. A patriotic toast complimentary to General Basks wa followed by three rousing eheen and a tiger, when the gallant Gen oral arose and said that he could not but feel gratified by the honors paid to him and the scene by which he was surround ed. Ee never felt better satisfied with any mndertaking. The Government had given hie expedition a good chance, and if his isnceeae should be equal to his wishes, New York would be satisfied, the Government Strengthened, and humanity ennobled. He hae under his command men of intelli gence, courage and patriotism, who will Work and fight in defense of their country. At this point the General paused, when he Was loudly called upon to go on, but he good-naturedly replied -that there was a potot where he should stop talking, and he thought he had reached it completely. to it Help for English Operatives. , At a meeting of the New York Chamber of Commerce held on Thursday, the most munificent response was made to the call for help for the starving poor of England. Messrs. N. L. & Geo. Griswold offered the free nse of a new ship of 1800 tons to con vey the supplies free of charge, and their ervioee, if needed, to forward them to England, an offer which is valued at not lest than SLO.OOO. An unknown gentle man, who signed his offer "Union", gave one thousand barrels of flour and seven one-thousand dollar Treasury notes. Other offers were mode of from five thousand to one hundred dollars. Subsequently A. T. Stewart, the dry goods prince, gave $10, 000. New York is pouring out of her abundance with no stinting hand, and it will require but a very few days to make np a losd for the noble ship of the Messrs. Griswold. to of S. The Rochester Demoorat, Boston Courier, Albany Argus and Albany Evening Jour nal, have reduced the size of their sheets on account of the high price of paper. The Oswego Times, in view of the high price of piiating material, has cut down iti lise one' column on each page. Report of Secretary Chase. The report of the Secretary of the Treas ury is very long and full, filling two very close pages of the New York papers. It is obviously too long to publish entire in our eolumns,and we avail ourselves of a synop sis from the Tribune, of its principal fea tures. The report is clearly and forcibly written, and at this period, when the means of carrying on the war expenses of the Government are subjects of such vast im portance, it will be read with an. interest second only to that given to the President's Message. The Treasury report has gener ally been a mere mass of dry statistics, but at this time every man's pocket is vi tally interested in the recommendations of the able head of that bureau. The Secretary explains why a change of circumstances may cause estimates to ex ceed expenditures such as the great in crease of the army. Disbursements, how ever, up to the 80th of June, 1862, were al- most precisely according to the Secretary's last December estimate : the disbursements being, in round numbers, 614 million dol lars, and the estimates 617 millions. The estimate of debt to be incurred up to the commencement of July, 1863,is over eleven hundred millions; and if the war be con tinued in full force till the 1st of Jul 1 18134, the debt likely to have been then in curred is set down at seventeen hundred and fifty-four millions The Secretary is happy in the statement whiche can make in regard to the reduc tion of the cost of the debt, or tbe interest. The first loans being of such nnusual mag nitude, were handsomely paid for: but large amonnts are now obtained at from four to five per cent- while the circulation of the C 8. notes continues practically a loan from the people to the Government, without interest. The average rate of loans is thus reduced to 4 per cent. Both receipts and expenditures will be increased for the current and following year. Ag gregate receipts for the fiscal year 100:2, $583,885,247 06; expenditures, 070,841,- 1 00 2d: balance in Treasury July, 18b 'J, $13,043,546 91. The actual rcoeipts of the first quarter of the fiscal year of 1803, com mencing August 1, 1802, are noted on the Treasury books; the other three quarters must be estimated. The one is actually $37,208,629 62 ; the others estimated $143,- 286,816 63. Loans during first quarter, $114,458,321 02; and during October and November, $35,670,895 99. Loans ob tained up to 1st December, $200,129,71701, and to be realized probably, ur ker existing (5ws, in addition, $131,021,197 35 making the total of receipts under actual and anticipated laws, $511,646,659 9G. For the first quarter of the fiscal year J 003, the actual expenditures were $111,084,447 40. tor the second, third and fourth quarters estimated ex penditures, under existing appropriations, including interest on public debt, are $072,843,841 73. Estimates of deficien cies to be met, $109,413,032 80. Making the wbole amount actually expended or estimated, $893,346,321 48. Estimates, for payment of public debt during the year, or $3o,zlz,ibb 14; making an ag gregate for all purposes of $988,563,777 62. It is usual to make an -estimate large enough to cover all possible requirements under it until a session of Congress shall afford an opportunity of providing for any deficiencies that may thereafter occur. Hence estimates always largely exceed expenditures. The appropriations unex pended, therefore, will lessen the above sum by $200,000,000, making it $788, 658,777 C2. But of this sum, as already stated, there has been received, and may be expected of customs, etc., $180,495,345 60; and loans, $331,150,914 .6. Aggre gate, to be deducted from actual and an ticipated expenditure, $511,646,259 96 ; and leaving to be provided fortbe current year, $276,912,617 66. The 6coreiry next oners the conjectural estimates of the fiscal year 1804, commencing the 1st of July next. Expenditures: $845,000,000. Receipts, customs, taxes, Sc., $223,000,- 000. Leaving amount to be provided for, $622,000,600. Amount needed beyond resources under existing laws, if war con tinues, for the fiscal year 1863, $276,000,- 000; for the fiscal year 1864, $622,000,000. Aggregate: $900,000,000. A tabular state ment is submitted with the report as a part of it, giving receipts and expenditures of financial years of 1862, 1803, and 1864, Details of debt are also submitted. The Secretary reviews his recommendations to Congress to increase duties; by a direct tax; by internal duties; emit notes; nego tiate loans, etc. Unexpected military de lays required further financial operations. The suspension of specie payment by banks is treated financially. The Secreta ry describes the loans made and the course he took thereupon. He considers the value of the Treasury-Note system in the present exigency. $150,000,000 in all have been emitted. Congress authorized, late in the session, $150000,000 more; $5(1000,000 of which were to be reserved from issues un til actually required for payment of de posit. Still later, Congress, upon the recommendation of the Secretary, author ized a fractional currency. Total author ized emission, $250,000,000. Sixty millions received from customs were not available for circulation, but might be replaced as paid in by notes of the new issues which were thus available, so that in the end, a total circulation of $250,000,000 might be reached, and on an improbable contintren- cy increased $50,000,000 more. The Sec retary recommended and Congress author- zed the receipt on temporary deposit of $100,000,000 at 6 percent., and payment creditors who liked of debt certificates one year and 6 per cent Congress authorized bonds to the amount of $-300 -000,000, convertible at will of holder to United states notes; bonds at 6 per cent. specie, and redeemable afu i jeara. They are called live-twenties or five- twenty sixes. The good results have ex ceeded the Secretary's expectations. The Secretary expresses regret that his recom mendation in regard to a general bank ing law, etc., were not carried out. 1st July, $08,000,000 on deposit. United States Notes issued, $158,000,000: S19.- 000,000 paid in certificates of debt; $208, 000,000 in cash. Every call on the Treas ury answered, and all army business with promptly executed. Balance in the Treasury, $13,000,000. Notwithstanding the unexpected demands on the Treasury. arising from army reverses, the Secretary has provided for constantly increasing disbursements. Payments during the quarter ending September SO, other than for the principal of public debt were $111,000,000; October, $49,000,000; No vember, $59,000,000. All requisitions be yond resources, only $19,000,000. ' Power borrow or gel loans under aot of July, 1001, is exhausted, secretary considers financial laws. He dues not favor the is sue of Treasury Notes to pay S276, 000,000 as needed. A limited issue under certain restrictions might answer. The Secretary does not believe the present pa per issues redundant. Stoppage of specie payments, and rears or ignorant people abroad throwing stocks into the market, caused gold to be an object of speculation, till it reached 87$ per cent. The Secreta ry treats of the cause of the rise ; not to be att"buted mainly to increase of currency. The cause of redundancy is the increase corporate notes. He recommends a U. Bank circulation, and the reduction of the bank-note circulation. Be renews the proposition to lay a moderate tax on cor porate circulation, and considers it the best means of gradual reduction and sub stitution. The Secretary believes in a Bound circulation of uniform value, through banking associations organ ized under La ional legislation. He disensses the national resources lands, mines, &C, ana is nopelul of the fu tare, Th modo of obtaining the new j loans is handled. Certain restrictions in theact authorizing the issue of bonds, he advises to be taken off. The bullion re ceived at the Mint last financial year was $15,000,000. Amount coined gold, $15,- 000,000; silver, near 3,000,000, etc. To tal coinage, $65,000,000. Bullion depos ited at Assay Office, N. Y., $26,000. In San Francisco gold deposited in branch mint, $16,000,000; silver, $749,000. The Secretary recommends that the present demonetisation of gold may be well availed of for the purpose of taking one consider able step toward having uniform weights, measures and coins. vIle recommends that the half eagle be made equal to the sovereign of Oreat Britain. He discusses the trade between the loyal and disloyal States; Cus tom-House frauds ; the necessity of a N. 1 Assistant Collector; the requirements of the tt. 1. Custotn-House building; tbe ad ministration of the hospital fund; the is sue of stamp currency ; the printing and engraving of Treasury notes; the labors of the Bureaus; the property destroyed through military service ; the appointments of certain deputies; the inspection of steam boats; the revenue-cutter service; praises the coal survey; glances at maps and charts and lighthouse ; then concludes without any peroration. The report it written with a clearness, force, and elegance of all papers emanat ing from the distinguished secretary of the Treasury. Report of Secretary Chase.
