In speaking of Hawaii President Roosevelt urges that provisions be made lor harbor improvements on eacn island. llus is cood news for Maui, and would menu pro visions for breakwater and fur dredging Kahului harlor, which is Maui's shipping center. Poor Mnn to Pny Lew. Tnx. On the tax problem the President recommends that, "as far as pos sible we should lighten tho burden of taxation on the small man." This meets with the views of the average man, and puts the question on the point of adjustment. When the State wants more revenue there must 1k additional taxes, and the burden usually falls on lioth rich and poor alike. The President meant inheritance taxes, and possibly ,a graduated tax thereon, but if a graduated taxis applied to inheritances and is pro ven a success, how long will it be before graduated taxation will be applied to.all other taxable assets? Injunction!. Another burning issue on which we once looked from a mere academical point of view, but from which recent developments have rudely disturW'd us is the injunc tion issue. We feel when; public rights are involved on one side an injunction should have prompt and early attention . On this subject President Roose velt says: 'The power of injunc tion is a great equitable remedy, which should on no account be destroyed. But safeguards sjiould be erected against its abuse. I be lieve some uch provisions as those I advocated a year ago for cheeking the abuse of the issuance of tem porary injunctions should le adopt-1 ed." Temporary injunctions are a tem porary nuisance and should lie at tended to very promptly. Forestry. On the subject of forestry, and forest preservation President Roose velt points out to Congress the im portance of conserving ' '.the natural resources of the country." for it matters not to what agency de forestation is due. While he has taken his examples from the ruin tliat followed de forestation of Northern China we. residents of Maui, need only point to the sufferings to the district of Kula for ours. Twenty-five years ago a heavy forest still covered the mountain slopes alwvc Kula clear over to Ulupalakua reaching down and across the pre sent public highway in some' places. Even then and for , forty years immediately preceding the reckless cutting of timber had been going on. But about that1 time small farmers, principally Chinese, began to take up land in Kula recklessly clearing and destroying what was left of the old forest, in order to use the rich virgin land for raising crops of potatoes,-corn, etc., and of the deplorable conditions that have since arisen this extract taken from tho President's message describes it as if he had Kula in mind when he wrote: i "The climate has changed and is still changing. It has changed even within the last half century, as the work of tree destruction has been consummated. The great masses of arlwreal vegetation on the mountains formerly absorbed the heat of the sun and sent up currents of cool air which brought the moisture-laden clouds, lower and forced them t.o precipitate in rain a part of their burden of water. Now that there is no vegetation the barren mountains, scorched by the suu, send up currents of heated air wjiich drive away instead of attract ing the rain ekmds, and cause their moisture to be disseminated. In consequence, instead of the regular and plentiful rains which exist in these regions of China when the forests were still in evidence, the unfortunate inhabitants of the de- t. ... ..... i i . . i . . . wither for lack of rainfall, while the seasons grow more and more irregular; and as the air becomes dryer certain crops refuse longer to grow at all. The deforestation of the mountain above Kula and the sufferings of that district from drouth ought not to go by unheeded. We should take, warning before other districts arc stricken in a like manner. We should reforest the mountain sides where donuded of trees. The borers, beetles, fungus and other pests are at work on the old forest trees, as any one who will look closely cm see, and soon fhe old forests would ie gone. Was it a mere coincidence that when Chinese took tin farniimr lands in the Kula. mountains the terrible conditions alluded by .the President as prevailing in North China ap peared in Kula? The At-my. The President condemns the pre sent system of promotion of army officers by seniority. He speak of the desirability of refusing to pro mote respectable elderly incom petents, in the army and of a desire to adopt a process of selection in promotion and of elimination for lge, mental, physical and temper- mental disabilities to improve the efficiency of the military. If we mistake not the President's process of elimination by putting officers periodically through a strenuous course of horse back rid ing would be an admirable test of physical fitness. . The use of Fire-Arms. in speaking of the use of tire- arms by citizens the President points out the unfortunate truth "that the great body .of our citizens shoot less and less as time noes on." and urges the desirability of encourag ing rifle practice amoung school boys and among all classes, for the first step in the direction of pre paration to avert war is to teach our men, to shoot and to .shoot straight. ' When this nation spends millions of dollars yearly in giving its naval and military forces needed cannon and rifle practice why should this little Territory ehargo the citizens a license for the privilege of using a rrfle or a shot "gun?. Under such discouragement when the reserve militia of this Territory is called out in time of war, if it comes, how- many of them will know how to handle a gun let alone doing effec tive work with it at the usual light ing range? In military circles a man who knows how to use the long range ritle of today effectively is rated as a military factor worth one-hundred green recruits. The Four Big Battle Ships. The President's recommendation of a naval program calling for a full battle squadron of four new battle ships of the all big gun type should have the approval of Hawaii. , . When Congress decided on two big ships at the last session we thought it did well in reducing the nuniU-r of ships, but since looking at it from another point of view we have come to the conclusion that four battle ships this session will be alout right, and for several reasons. In the first place a bigger navy will deter other nations from want ing a war with us and in the next place, if war should come, Hawaii as a frontier Territory will 1m- the first to feel it and likely to suffer the most, so far the good of these sunny isles the United States should maintain an efficient battle squad ron in the Pacific, all of which mean a bigger navy such as the President has recommended, for a strong navy spells peace and safety for us.

J . llart writes as follows in St. Mary's Collegian. Of eoime, an excursion to the volcano Kilauea is in order for every traveler it is neither just to himself nor to Hawaii to fail to see this, one of the world's wonders Thirty-six hours at sea brought us to Ililo, the metropolis of the island of Hawaii. Ah! I shan't forget those thii t vand-six hours! I was seasick. After some twenty or thirty miles of assorted land travel our excursion reached the t i . . . volcano House. Minner was but you forget even such lurid dc tails when memory turns pages to Kilauea. Two miles of real walk ing and Hawaiian miles they must be, too, over lava beds, brought us to the crater. Silence seemed natural and, as we peered. first searchingly, and then with eyes focused at space, a great rcali zatiou ot the Urator s presence over-came me. If ever my heart was filled with the fear of God that moonlight night was the veri est time. How canny was that si lence, broken, or rather intensified, by the dull moaning and incessant hissing of the molten stuff beneath us. A thought.of Kilauea's possi bilities, even probabilities, are ter rorizing; and science, with her knowledge, detracts vastly from the terror which inspired the pri mitive llawaiians to worship a Goddess of Fire, resident in Kilau ea. With thoughts still rampant we traced footsteps over the so. lenin, grotesque lava beds an hour later. I could not begin to describe Kilauea coherently. As for naked cold dimensions, the crater is a mile around, and a hundred feet below the spectator's viewpoint is the seething matter. Any person and particularly any atheist who has a two months to spare should visit Ha waii and its Kilauea. The indus try" and geological conditions of all Hawaii and the inevitable Hawa iian hospitalify satisfies every visi tor. And, withal, it is a "piece of our country." Hilo Tribune.
