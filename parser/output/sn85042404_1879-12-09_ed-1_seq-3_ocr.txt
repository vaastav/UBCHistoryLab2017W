A coaling station ia to be established there which will be convenient and useful to the United States vessels. ROUMANIA AND 8EUVIA. The subject of opening diplomatic relations with lloumaoia and Servia, now become inde pendent sovereignties, at present under consideration and ia a subject of diplomatic correspondence. FOREIGN TRADE. There is a gratifying inorease of trade with nearly all European and American countries, and it is believed that by judicious action in re gard to its development it can and wil 1 be still more enhanced, and that American- products and manufactures will find new and expanding markets. The reports of diplomatic and con sular officers upon this subject under the sys '. tern now adopted have resulted in obtaining much valuable information which has been and will continue to be laid before Congress ,4 and the publio from time to time. ALASKA. The third article of the treaty with Russia of March 30, 1SG7, by which Alaska was ceded to the United States, provides that the inhabi­ tants of the ceded territory, with the exception of uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all rights of citizens of the United States, and shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their lib­ erty, prosperity and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such laws and regulations as the United States may from time to time adopt. In regard to the aboriginal tribes of that country, both the obligations of the treaty and the necessities of the people demand that some organized form of government over the territory of Alaska be adopted. There appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged with common law offenses, such as assault, robbery and murder, and no magistrate author­ ized to issue «r execute process in such cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen from offenses of this character, not only among the original inhabitants but among citizens of the United States and other countries who have engaged in mining, fishing and other business operations within the terri­ tory. A bill authorizing the appointment of justices of the peace and constables, and the arrest and detection of persons charged with criminal offenses and providing for an apeal to United States courts for the district of Oregon on suitable cases will at the proper time be sub­ mitted to Congress. THE TREASURY. The attention of Congress is called to the annual report of the secretary of the treasury on the condition of the public finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year end­ ing June 30, 1879 were 8273,827,18-1 46 The ordinary expenditures for the same period were 266,947,883 53 Leaving a surplus revenue for the year of 6,879,300 93 The receipts for the present fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, actual and estimated, are as fol­ lows: Actual receipts for first quarter commencing July, 1879 $ 79,843,663 61 Estimated receipts fur remain­ ing three quarters of the year 208,156,334 39 Total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and esti­ mated 288,000,000 00 The expenditures for the same peri:td will be, actual and estimated, as follows: for tbe quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expendi­ tures $ 91.683,385 10 For the remaining three quar­ ters of the year tbe expendi­ tures are estimated at Making tbe total expenditures. Leaving an estimated surplus of revenue for the year end­ ing Jnne 30, 1880, of. The total receipts during the next fiscal ending June 30, 1881, estimated according to existing laws, will be And the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same period will be.... 172,316,614 90 264,000,000 00 24,000,000 00 288,000,000 00 278,097,364 39 Leaving a surplus of $9,902,635.61 for that year. The large amonnt expended for the arrears of pensions during the last and the present fiscal year, amounting to $21,747,249.60, bas prevented tbe appropriation of the full amount required by law to the sinking fund for the current year, but these arrears having been substantially paid, it is believed that the sink­ ing fund can hereafter be maintained without any change of the existing law. THE WAR 

DEPARTMENT. The secretary of warjreports that the war'de­ partment estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same being for a less sum of money than any annual estimate rendered to Congress from that de­ partment during a period of at least twelve years. He concurs with the general of tbe army in recommending such legislation as will authorize the establishment of the full number of 25,000 men for the line of the army, exclu­ sive of 3,463 men required for detached duties, and therefore not available tor service in tbe field. He also recommends that Congress be asked to provide by law for the disposition of a large |uumber of abandoned military posts and reservations which, though very valuable in themselves, have been rendered useless for military purposes by the advance of civili­ zation and settlement. Be unites with the quartermaster general in recommending that appropriations be made for the construction of a cheap and perfectly fire­ proof building for the Bafe storage of a vast amount of money, accounts, vouchers, claims and other valuable reports now in the quarter­ master general's office and exposed to great risk and to total destruction by fire. He also.recommends, in conformity with the views of the judge advocate general, some de­ sultory legislation in reference to the military statute of convictions as applied to the crime of desertion. In these several recommendations I concur. The secretary of war further reports that the work for the improvement of the south pass of the Mississippi river, under contract with Mr. James B. Eads, made in pursuance of an act of Congress, has been prosecuted during the past year with a greater measure of success in the attainment of the results than during any previous years. The channel through the South Pass, which at the begin­ ning of operations in June, 1875, bed a depth of only seven and one-half feet of water, had, on"the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of twenty-six feet, having a width of not less than 200 feet and a central depth of thirty feet. Payments have been made in accordance with the co tract, as the work has pro .'rcsscd. amounting in the aggregate to $4,259,009, and further pajments will become due as provided by tbe statutes, in event of success in main­ taining the chanuel now secured. -The reports of the general of the army and his subordinates present a full detailed ac _'ountof the milisary .operations for the sup­ pression of hostilities, and praises are justly awarded the officers and troops engaged, for the promptitude, skill and courage displayed. Tbe past year bas been one of nlmost un­ broken peace and quiet on the Mexican fron­ tier, and there is reason to believe the efforts of this government and of Mexico to maintain •rder in that region will prove permanently The department was enabled during the past 1 year to find temporary though crowded ac oommodation and safe depository for a portion 1 A is V1 ]'li:' '-,UA. of its records in the completed east wing of the building, designed for the state, war and navy departments. The construction of the north wing of the building, the part of the structure intended for use of the war depart­ ment, is being carried forward with all pos­ sible dispatch, and the work should receive from Congress Buch liberal appropriations as will secure its speedy completion. THE 

NAVY. The report of the secretary of the navy shows continued improvement in that branch of the service.^During the last fiscal year extensive repairs have been made on vessels and two new ships have been completed and made ready for Bea. The total expenditures,ended June30,1879, including specific appropriations not esti­ mated for by the department, were $1,353,• 571 09. The expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting the amonnt ot the specific ap­ propriation, were $13,343,317.79. But this is subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants, but not "paid out during the year. The amount of appropriations applied to the last fiscal year was $14,538,646.17. There was therefore a bal­ ance of $1,479,054.37 remaining unexpended and to the credit of the partment on June 30. 1879. The estimates for tbe fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $14,864,147.93, which exceeds the appropriations for the present fiscal year $301, 897.28. The reason for this increase is ex­ plained in the secretary's report. The appro­ priations available for the present fiscal year are $14,502,250.67, which will, injtbe opinion of tbe secretary, answer all the ordinary demands of the service. The amount drawn from the treasury from July 1st to Nov. 14, 1879, was $5,770,404.12, of which $1,095,440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditures for that period $4,074,963.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds of tbe year do not exceed the proportion for these four months, tht re will renain unexpended at the end of the year $477,359.30 of current appropriations. The report of tbe secretary shows the gratifying fact that among all the disbursing officers of the pay corps of the navy, there is not one who is a defaulter to tlie extent of a single dollar. 1 unite with him in recom­ mending the removal of the Observatory to a more healthful location. That institution re­ flects credit upon the nation and has obtained tbe approbation of scientific men in all parts of the world. Its removal from its present lo­ cation would not only be conducive to tbe health of its officers and professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The appropriation for judicial expenses which has heretofore been made for the department of justice in grosB was subdivided^at the last ses­ sion of Congress, and no appropriation what­ ever was made for the payment of the fees of marshals and their deputies, either in the ser­ vice of process or for the discharge of other du­ ties, and since June 30 these officers have con­ tinued the performance of their duties without compensation from tbe government, taking upon themselves the necessary incidental out­ lays, as well as rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable instances has the proper execution of process of the United States failed by reason of the absence of the requisite appropriations. ThiB com so of official conduct on the parr of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the at­ torney general, who informed them, bow ever, that they would necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon tbe pros­ pect of future legislation by Congress. I therefore especially ,-ecommend that an imme­ diate appropriation be made by Congress for this purpose. The act making the principal appropriation the department of justice at previous ses­ sions has uniformly contained the following clause: "And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the enforcement of the act approved Feb. 28, 1870, entitled an act to amend an act approved May 30, 1870, entitled an act to enforce the right of citizens in the United States to vote in the several States of the United States, and for other purposes, or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto." No appropriation was made for this purpose for the current year. As no general election for members of Congress occurred, the omission was a matter of little practical importance. Such elections will, however, take place during the ensuing year, and the appropriation for the pay of marshals and deputies should be suffi­ cient to embrace compensation for the services they may be required to perform at such elec­ tions. THE SUPREME COURT. The business of the supreme court is at pres­ ent largely in arrears. It caunot be expected that more cases can be decided than are now dispose! of in the annuai session, or that by any assiduity the distinguished magistrates who compose the court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits the business has increased to such an extent that the delay of justice will call the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed all is done in each circuit which can be fairly expected, and the evils arising from delay are less heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors, as its causes are ad­ vanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve the discussion of questions of a public character. The remedy suggested by the attorney gen eral is the appointment of additional ciicult judges and tbe creation of an intermediate court of errors and appeals, which shall relieve the supreme court of apart of its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for tbe performance of cirouit duties. I recommend this suggestion to the consideration of Con­ gress. It would seem to afford a complete remedy and would involve, if ten additional circuit judges are appointed, an expenditure at tbe present rate of salaries of not more than $60,000 a year, which would certainly be small in comparison with the obj?cta to be attained. THE 

POSTOFFICE. The report of the postmaster general bears testimony to the general revival in business throughout the country. The receipts of the postoffice department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, was $30,041,982.86, being $764,465.91 more than in the preceding year, and $2,3S7,559.23 more than in 1877. The ex pendituies of the department were $33,149, 899.45, of which the sum of $376,461.61 was paid on liabilities incurred in preceeding years. Tbe expenditures during the year were $801, 209.77 less than in the preceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the ope­ ration of the law passed on June 17, 1877, changing the compensation of postmasters from a commission on the valuaof stampssold, to a commission on the stamps cancelled. The amount drawn from the treasury on ap­ propriations, in addition to the revenues of the department, was $303,454.06, being $2, 276,W7,86 less than in the preceeding year. The expenditures of the fiscal year ending, June 30, 1881, are estimated at' $39,920,900, and ihe receipts from all sources at $32,210, 000, leaving a deliciency to be appropriated for out of the treasury of $7,710,900. The relations of the department with tbfe railroad companies have been harmonized, notwithstanding the general reduction by Congress of their compensation by the appro­ priation for general facilities, and the railway postoffico lines have been greatly extended, es­ pecially in the Southern States. The interests of the railway mail Rcrv'co would be greatly promoted and. the expendi­ tures con be readily controlled by the classi­ fication of the employes of the railway mail, as recommended by the postmaster general. The appropriations for services with respect to ^vfw J' 'F- */,,, VV -v which the maximum limit is already fixed by law to be made in gross. The postmaster general recommends an amendment to the law regulating an increase of compensation for increased service and in­ creased speed on Star routes so as to enable him to advertise for proposals for such in­ creased service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to the commerce of the country from the enact­ ment of a general law authorizing contracts with American built ft earners carrying the American flag for transporting the mail be­ tween the United States and ports of tbe West Indies and South America at a fixed maximum per mile, the amount to be expended being equalated by annual appropriations in like manner with tbe amount for the domestic Star service. The arrangements made by tbe postmaster general and the secretary of the treasury fot the collection of duties upon books received in tbe mail from foreign countries bas proved so satisfactory in its practical opera­ tion that the recommendation is now made that Congress now extend the provisions of the act of March 3, 1879, under which this arrange­ ment was made, so as to apply to all other dutiable articles received in the mails from foreign countries. THE 

INDIANS. The reports of the secretary of the interior aud of the commissioner of Indian affairs, set­ ting forth the present state of our relations with the Indian tribes and our territory, the measures taken to advance their civilization and prosperity, and tbe progress already achieved by them, will be found of more than ordinary interest. The general conduct of our Indian population has been so satisfactory that the occurrence of two disturbances which resulted in bloodshed and destruction of prop­ erty, is all the more to be lamented. The history of the outbreak on the White River Ute reservation, Western Colorado, has become so familiir by elaborate report in the public press, that its remarkable incidents need not be stated here in detail. It is ex­ pected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to such arrangements as will prevent further hostile cor.flicts between tbe Indixns and the border settlements in Western Col orado. Tbe other disturbances occurred at the Mes celaro Agency in New Mexico, where Nieland, tbe head of a small band of marauders, after committing many atrocities, being vigorously charged by a military force made his way across tbe Mexican border and is no«v on a for­ eign soil. While these occurrences, in which compara­ tively small numbers of Indians were engaged, •re most deplorable, a vast majority of our In­ dian population have fully justified the expec­ tation of those who believe that by humane and peaceful influences, the Indians can be led to abandon the habits of savage life, and to develop a capacity for useful sad civilized occupations. What they have already accomplished is shown in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work. The remarkable success which has at­ tended the experiment of employing as freight­ ers a class of Indians hitherto counted among tbe wildest and most intractable, and the gen­ eral and urgent desire expressed by them for the education of their children, may be taken as sufficient proof that they will be found ca­ pable of accomplishing much more if they con­ tinue to be wisely and fairly guided. Tbe Indian policy, sketched in the report of the secretary of the interior, tbe object of which js to mako liberal provisions for the education of Indian youths, to settle the In dians upon farm lots in severalty, and to give them title in4fee on their farms inalienable for a certain number of years, and when their wants are thus provided, to dispose of by "V" fr^ Eale of lands on their reservations, not occupied and used by them, a* fund to be formed out of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians, which will gradually relieve the government of the expenses now provided for by annual appropriations, must commend itself as iust and beneficial to tbe Indians and is calculated to remove those obstructions which the exist­ ence of large reservations presents to the set­ tlement and development of the country. I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enabling the government to give Indi­ ans a title in fee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to them by allotment. I also repeat the recommendation in my first annual message that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proofs by their own labor of supporting their families for a number of years, and who are willing to de­ tach themselves from their tribal relations, to the becetit of the homestead act, and to grant them patents containing tbe same provision of inalienability for a certain period. The experiment of sending a number of In­ dian children of both sexes to the Hampton normal and agricultural institute, in Virginia, to receive an elemementary English education and practical instruction in farming and other industries, has led to results so promising that it was thought expedient to turn over the cav­ alry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the interior department for the establishment of an Indian school on a larger scale. This echool has now 158 pupils, selected from various tribes and in full operation. Arrangements are also made for the education of a number of Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on tbe Pacific slope in a similar manner at Forest Grove in Oregon. These institutions will commend themselves to the liberality of Congress and to the philanthropic munificence of the American people. Last spring information was received of the organization of an extensive movement in the Western States, the object of which was the occupation by anauthorized persons of certain lands in the Indian country ceded by tbe Chero kees to the government for the purpose of set­ tlement by other Indian tribes. Ca the 29th of April I issued a proclamation warning all persons against participation in Buch an at­ tempt and by the co-operation of a military force the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect the rights of the In­ dian inhabitants' of that Territory to tbe full extent of tbe executive, but it would be un­ wise to ignore the fact that a Territory so large, and with a population so sparce, and BO great a wealth cf unused resources, will be found more exposed to the repetition of such attempts as happened this year, when the surrounding States are more densely settled, and the westward movement of our population look still more eagerly for freBh lands to occupy. Under such circum­ stances the difficulty of maintaining the In­ dian territory in its present state will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to prepare for such a contin­ gency. I therefore fully approve of the advice given to them by the secretary of the interior on a recent occasion to divide among them­ selves in severalty as large a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire individual title in fee instead of the present tribal ownership in common, and consider in what manner the balance of their lands may be'disposed of by the government for their benefit. By adopting su.'h a policy they would more certainly secure themselves in the value of their possessions and at the same ticie pro­ mote progress in civilisation and prosperity, than by, endeavoring to perpetuate the present state of things in the Territory. The question whether a change in the oontrol of tbe Indian service should be mado was in the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint committee of both Honses for inquiry and re­ port. In my last annnal messageIexpressed the hope that a decision of that questior, then in prospect, would arrest further agitation of this subject, each asritation being apt to pro­ duce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as the Indians themselves. Since then, Z'^T' '•f ,f,5 tbe committee having reported, the questions have been decided in tbe negative by a vote in the House of Representatives. For the reason here stated and in view of the faet of further uncertainty on this point, will be calculated to obstruct other much needed .legislation, to weaken the discipline of the service and to unsettle salu­ tary measures now in progress for the govern­ ment and improvement of the Indians,I respect­ fully recommend that the decision arrived qt by Congress at its last cession be permitted to Btand.
