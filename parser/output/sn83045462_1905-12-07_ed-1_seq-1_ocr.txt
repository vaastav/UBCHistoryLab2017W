CRITICISM GENERAL ON THE LARGE SALARIES PAID SPECIAL EMPLOYES. Remaiks of One Republican. Leader. Which Summarize Expressions by a Number of Others. A big storm is brewing in the House over the Panama cana! expenditures, and the very vigorous talk over the pending bill is certain to be followed by some stringent legislation restricting salaries and con tracts. I he Interesting feature of the situation I* that the criticism is not confined to the democrats, but is as general among the lepuilicans, and is directed against the ad ministration. In conversation .with each other today republicans high In the party j in the Mouse spoke out in vigorous criti cism of the administration In permitting th:s situation to be presented by which the demo, rats ar. Riven an opportunity to find fault. Republican representatives talked freely In the cloak rooms and lobbies and took no pains to conceal their views. Some Remarks of One Leader. The remarks of one republican of influ ence and prominence to a Star man this afternoon would summarize similar ex pressions by a number of others This man said: Here conies the President with an ad monition to Congress to !>e frugal and eco nomical. to scan expenditures, and on the heels of this warning there is precipitated upon Congross evidence that the adminis tration has been dealing out salaries with ? lavish hand to Its particular friends. Tak? that salary of $10,000 to the press agent of the commission and compare It with the salary of $\000 which the Secre tary of War. who Is at the head of the whole canal project. Is paid. There is a general auditor who draws $10,000, and after he has audited the accounts they have to go to the regular auditor of the \\ar Department, who gets only $4,."?o0. There is a purchasing agent at $10,000, probably three times the amount paid to men in the army and navy who purchase as many supplies as he will be called upon to buy. There Is the case of the paymas ter who went out in No vein Iter, an officer In the navy. His salary in the navy was $2,400, but the canal commission pays him His successor has been jumped to $9,000. "There is the chief sanitary officer, an of ficer in the army, where be gets $4,050 as a surgeon, but his; services to the canal com mission are rated at $10,000. The chief quarantine officer is a surgeon in the ma rine hospital service at $:i,2~>0, but his worth to the commission is supposed to be fT.000. Of course they do not get that > Oin jensation in addition to their service pay. "These are a few of the cases among the many instances of high-priced men em ployed by the commission. Will Stand by the Commission. "The republicans intend to stand by the commission, but we cannot be blamed for feeling angry that the administration has given opportunity for criticism. The out come Is certain to be the enactment of leg islation by the committee on interstate and foreign commerce, fixing salaries and otherwise throwing limitations around ex penses and contracts. I do not believe it will be necessary for an investigation. I do not believe, and !n that I think I express the opinion of the leaders of the House, that there has been any wrongdoing in the canal work, and that an investigation would only be a waste of time. The committee will doubtless call upon the commission for Its reasons for paying these high salaries, and if the reasons are valid they will be given due consideration. "Another outcome of the situation. In my opinion, will be a general overhauling of departmental expenses and salary list, espe cially as to special commissions and tem porary organizations." 

PRESIDENT AGREES. Sanitary Inspection of Government Departments.

PROBING IHMCE Mutual Reserve Officials on the Stand AT NEW YORK TODAY TESTIMONY AS TO CERTAIN PAY MENTS UNDER HARPER WILL. Vice President Elredge Questioned About His Inaction in Regard to Illegal Contract. NEW YORK, "December 7.?The first wit ness to appear before the insurance Investi gating committee today was William A. Butts, paymaster of the Mutual Reserve Ufe Insurance Company of this city. Mr. Hughes, counsel for the committee, asked h'rn for an account of the payments made by the company to Mrs. Harper, he'r of the estate of former President Kdward B. Har per, as commissions 011 premiums which Mr. Harper bequeathed to his estate and to be paid after his death. The witness was temporarily excused and J. A. Hyland, bookkeeper of the Mutual Re Ferve, was called and identified entries in the books of the company showing pay ments of ?fi<>0 each to Mrs. Harper in 18U5 and 1800. Some of them were cheeked with the initials of Frederick A. Burnham, presi dent of the Mutual Reserve Company. Witness Hyland s i:d Mrs. Harper is now Mrs. Orlando H. Dornian, having married since Mr. Harper's death. The total amount paid to her by the Mu tt:;;! Reserve Company under the will of IOd ward B. Harper, witness said, was and is still being paid one-third of 'jo cents on each Sl,0ix? insurance in force prior to 1?'.5. Wllne:-s did not know that any money in the Harper account was paid to Presi dent F A. Burnham. William A. Butts, the paymaster, then went oi. the stand. He said he gave to President F. A. Burnham from the con tingent fund in Witness did not know what the president did with the money. Corrected Former Evidence. George D. Kidredge. vice president of fthe Mutual Reserve Company, was called and asked if he had not previously testified that the total amount paid to Mrs. Harper was ?48,600 and to the Harper family {35,000. The witness said he did not intend to have given such testimony. He W4S asked why he had not opposed such payments as hav ing been made under an illegal contract, as the company had once contended in a suit brought by one of tlie heirs. He said.he understood the courts decided it was legal in the previous suit. Mr. Hughes #aid the point was never adjudi cated. as the company's answer alleging illegality was withdrawn. Witness said he did not know why the 18,OiJO was paid to President Burnham. President Charles M. Turner of the Se curity Mutual Insurance Company of Bing hamton was recalled. In the course of his testimony he said that his company had paid $1,000 a year to D. H. Keeper, a clerk in the New York state insurance depart ment, to perform some duties as actuary of the Security Mutual. "It did not occur to me," said Mr. Turner, "that this con flicted with Mr. Keeper's duties to the in surance department." THE 

KOREAN. MINISTER Much Affected by His Brother's Death. Mr. Yeung Tchan Min, formerly minister of Korea to France, has arrived in this city and is staying at the Arlington. The bad news from his own country about the re ported suicide of his brother, Yeung Whan Min, which was brought to him very sud denly yesterday, has affected his health, and he was not able to receive any callers this morning or to announce his plans in the near future. It Is expected that he will call upon the President and Mr. Root and try to influ ence them in favor of his country, which, under the treaties just concluded with Ja pan, will lose most of its independence. In official circles, however, the feeling Is that although the former minister will be well received and will have a good deal of sym pathy, it will not be possible or wise for the government of the United States to In tervene in Korea's Issue with Japan. 

WILL RETIRE IN 1909. Senator Proctor Will Announce Inten tions to His Constituents. Senator Proctor of Vermont will send a letter to Ills cons'Kuents Informing them that he will resign liis seat in the Senate 011 or before March ?)> lt*K>, which is the date for the ending of the present presi dential administration. Mr. Proctor gives as his reason for this action that he is now ready to retire from public life and that if he continues to serve his state until the date indicated he will have had twerty years in Congress. This satisfies his am bition In that respect. He prefers not t.j end his senatorial term before 1009 because he considers it only fair to his successor that he shall take office at the commence ment of the new presidential teirm, so that he may have an opportunity to look af'.er new appointments that will begin on that date. He has also given this long advanje notice In order that his constituents r.uy have ample I'tne In which to select ills suc cessor. Senator Proctor stated that he did not know who would be most likely to succeed him. There will be many candid.ties for the office and among them will be Repre sentative Fosttr of Burlingion. Mr. "Foster is a Dartmouth man, about forty-eight ye irs of age, and has been I11 Congress two terms. His friends propose to make a Je iucxl effort to land him in the Senate.

The United States government will have to furnish post office boxes permanently to all citizens paying the first cost of the boxeg in all post offices now renting boxes to citizens, If a little bill introduced today by Representative Stephens becomes a law.

ADOPTED BY SENATE Action on the Tillman Bank Resolution. POLITICAL DONATIONS CONTRIBUTIONS BY INSURANCE COMPANIES DISCUSSED. After a Debate of More Than Usual In tel est and Animation Adjourn ment to Monday is Taken. At the beginning of today's session of ths Senato the Vice President designated Messrs. T.odge and Bacon to serve on the hrnrd of regents of the Smithsonian Insti tution. The Senate granted a request made by Mr. Culberson for the. printing of h docu ment prepared by Allison Msyfleld. a mem ber of the railroad commission of Texas, In reply to attacks made before the Inter state commerce committee on the railroad laws of Texas by Victor Morrowltz of New York, when the latter gentleman was be fore the comm'tt-e as a witness. At 11"i Instance of Mr. tJaliinger a 'evolu tion directing the eomm'.ttee < n naval at fairs to Investigate the condition of the old frigate Constitution with a view to its re pair was adopted. Banks' Campaign Contributions. Mr. Tillman called up his resolution call ing upon the Secretary of th> Treasury for information as to whe.h r the reports of bank examiners show the payment of cam paign contributions i?y national banks, and addressed the Semite. Outlining h f reisons for the inquiry, he called attention to the recommendation made by the President in his annual messages of Vol and 1U05 for the enactment of a law for proteedon against bribery ai.d corruption in connection with elections. He quoted with especial em phasis tli, President's remarks concerning campaign contrlLutl ns by corpora lima. "Our chief executive has taken .1 very progressive s;and to s< -ure purity i elec tions," he s.iid, and added: "livery ^ood American will say, "Well done,' and look for progress along that line." lie also quoted s atenients by Secretary Hoot and Perry Belmont of New York, of the same tenor as the President's rtinH.ks, saying that he would be impartial as be tween political parties. lie conceded that the Secretary mlyht not have the facts wanted, but he thought ha ought to have. Incidentally, Mr. Tillman said that he had been Informed that the controller of the currency has. been lav rs.i gating the subject of bank contributions, with the view of instituting legal proceed ings. Before Mr. Tillman had proceeded far Mr. Gallinger, who had yesterday objected to the consideration of -.he resolution at that time, said that he had done so oniy for the purpose of inspecting it, that he had done so and being entirely satisfied as to Its pro priety. would support the resolution. Continuing Mr. Tillman said that the con troller has means of getting information which others have not and added tha- If hs would "push in his probe he can make dis coveries that are worth while." The Insurance Scandal. He added that Ills reison for requesting the Information is found in the reveluations concerning the Insurance companies, "it has been shown by the testimony or confes sion of a member of this body," he said, "that for ten years the insurance corpora tions have been making annual donations to the republican party with the under staiding that they should be protect?-d from adverse legislation at Albany." He went on to say that such revelations were not agreeable. "I am the holder of a small policy In one of the Mutual's," he said, "and I don t like to have my dividends cut down In crder to give Mr. McCurdy J150.000 and his sifters, liis cousins and his aunts $75,0txt each." He expressed doubt as to the right of the federal authorities to take control or Insurance companies, and Mr. Hale inter rupted to say that he agreed with Mr. Till man on that point. He said further that the provision providing for such a pro vision was not properly considered, and he did not consider It,binding. Return of Contributions. Mr. Bailey asked whether the insurance company contributions to the republican national committee had been returned to tiie donors. "I understood." replied Mr. Tillman, "that the President was going to have Mr. Cor leiyou return them, but I don't know whether he has done so. I know that I haven't got my share." ill'. Spooner?"Is your's a life policy?'* Mr. Tillman?"It is." Mr. Spooner?"Then it is not yei time to realize on it." Mr. Tillman replied that it was dividends ana not the policy itself that he wanted piiid. "These," he said, "were pitifully small, while McCurdy has been getting tat with out doing anything." Mr. Bailey said he had not supposed the President would make a second recom mendation on the subject of punishing cam paign contributors until the money had bean returned. "Ah! Mr. President," responded Mr TH1 man. "all the Turveytops and Pecksniffs are not dead yet: although I would not for a moment be understood as comparing our strenuous occupant of the White Houae with those characters. What we want is reaul's. and those we do not seem to have procured so far." Quoting the testimony of Senator Piatt before the New York committee. Mr. Till man congratulated that senator upon his straightforwardness. "There was no d >dg ing," he said, "and I do not believe that a dollar of the money ever stuck to hla fingere." He added his conviction, however, that the conditions had had the effect of con trolling the New York legislature In the in terest of the insurance companies. Judge Parker's Charge.
