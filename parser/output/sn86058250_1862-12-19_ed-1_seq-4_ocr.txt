And looked up to heaven through the night, A viaioa came o'er me and lighted my brain ' With a glory that will never flood it again This aide of the river of light. And I heard a sweet sound, as it came Like the flutter of feathery wing, ---- And the voice of a seraph kept calling my name. And her breath In ray tresses went playing the same jt. As the air in an instrument's strings. I told my wild heart to be still That the via ton was naught but a dream; For I knew not that over the amethyst hill . The feet of my darling had wandered at will On the hanks of Eternity's stream. I said to the sanctified bird, ' Oh, why have you come from the West?'' And she told how the leaves of the forest were stirred By the feet of the angels who bro'lherthe word Of the land where the weary may rest. She said she was tired and faint. And her heart was all covered with snow. The angels they heard her unuitered complaint, They called her, and brought Iter the robes of a saint. And she Said she was ready to go. . . I told her the blossoms were sweet In the meadows, tbo Mime as of yore; But she showed me the., dew oh her sparkling feet, " ''" r , Pressed out of the lillies that bordered the street By the sand of the Paradise shore. 1 asked her hew Ion; I rnuet wait Before I should meet her afar; And I prayed her unfold me tho hook of my fate; But alio vaniohed and passed through the crys teline gate Site had left, in her coming, ajar. Dear Hugh, there' a battle to-day. And perchance 1 may happen to fall; If I'm not at the call of the roll, you may say A pood -by to the boys in my name, for 1 may slave said "aye" to an angel's sweet call.
