Chicago has opened its campaign against pneumonia by pointing out that those who eat too much and those who drink too much are in more dan ger than those who live tempcrato lives. But will it do any good in Chicago? The advance of 100 per cont in the price of yellow pine lumber iu tho last two years means that the South has a rich, but not inexhaustible, mine of wealth ic her pine forests.

On Wednesday, the 6th inst., thc AuguBta Chronicle issued a 16-pago illustrated immigration edition, which was an exceedingly interesting and timely paper.

"? jury in Seattlo has decided that a dog has a right to bito a man in self defense, relates the Portland (Ore.) Telegram. Thia is an interesting vcr diot. It appears that a dog bit a piece out of a man's leg, and the vic tim sued tho owner of tho dog for $10,000. Th defense was that tho dog would never havo bitten tho mas if ho had not been provoked to do ? and that as ho was provoked to dc u the dog was standing quito within his rights in biting the man. Tho defense was upheld, and dog and owner alike ought to bo happy. Many other cases of a similar nat'ire have been brought before, but this case is said to he the first time that the ju -y has taken this point of view. The Columbia Record of the 8tb last., says: "If tho now judicial bill passes Congress John ?G. Capers will not have smooth sailing in becoming Judge.

December iO.--Presi dent Harvie Jordan, of the Southern Cotton Association, issued u circular lotter to tho farmers of tho South to day regarding a reduction in cotton acreage for IOCS. Tho lotter says in part: "The Southern Cotton Association will not ask the farmers of tho South to reduce the cotton acreage for 1000 less than that planted in 1005. The Association doeB ask, and insist with all the force at its command, however, that the acreage planted In cotton throughout the bolt in 1005 be not in creased during the planting season of 1000. Let the , watchword of every Southern farmer be diversification, and through that agenoy produce nn abundance of food supplies to main tain each farm. "The present estimated twenty seven million acres planted in cotton is sufficient under normal climate con ditions to produce enough cotton to meet the demands of the spinners for the American, staple. Auy material increase in the cotton acreage of 1000 will tend to stagnate the cotton mar ket and depress prices below their legitimate value. The legitimate law ofsopply and demand 1B the only true medium ot regulating fair and legiti mate prices for our great staple pro President Jordan- cl o BOB the letter with a strong appeal to the farmers to plant an abundance ot small grain, corn and side crepe, and urges them to raise more hay, cattle and hops that the farms may become more self BUBtaining.
