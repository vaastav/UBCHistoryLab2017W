COMPROMISE BILL JuajBry it once and see if we are not correct about this 1 special to the cazette AW Washington Dec 19 Outside the gossip of committees the members ol Congress are still discussing the Presi dents message The one measure in which all agree is that a tariff bill must be considered by the House at an early day and that as the issue has been made the country will look to the House for tfce much needed relief From the Bpeech of Mr Reed of Maine delivered in the House on Friday last it Is pretty evident that the tobacco tas will be removed thus reducing the surplus some thirty milllous also the tax on fruit distillations A prominent southern memoer who repreenta a protective and tariff reform district combined stated that no tariff bill on the line of the Pres idents message COULD HAVE ANY SHOW of success in thia Congress and that such a measure as that proposed by the President would lose the support of the Virginia Alabama North Carolina and possibly some of the Georgia delegation However he said we will pass a compromise tariff bill and the Prtsidcnt will not veto it In the south the pro tective doctrine since the establishment of mining and manufacturing industries has had many converts while in the New EDgland states the sentiment has changed and the large manufactures are clamoring for tariff reform or as Borne say free trade One of the measures that will Remand the attention of the House at an early date is the Blair education bill The people of the country especially in the small southern towns ara IN 

FAVOR OF THE BILL Its passage of course will be urged this seesioni and froi what I can lesrn the friendsof the measure will not suffer it to hi killed Jn committee as I under stand it was In the last Congress5 One reason why a more deter mined effort will be made this session lies in the fact that by its passage the redaction of the tariff will be less on account of the amount which the Blair Mil calls for The people of Vir iuia and in the mountain districts of Keniucky in Aabsma Tennessee Georgia and I m y say the whole pouth are clamoring for the bill If the bill should fall to be reported thi3 session and is buffered to be pigeonholed vou may depend on it tost its death will be permanent but I will do all in my power to have the measure reach the President befoie the final adjourn nent A
