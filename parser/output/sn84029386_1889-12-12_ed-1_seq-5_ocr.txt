'5t Hr7 fJt-. Jk fje lejledor. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 18S9. Maiione is one of the deadest ducks of the year. Manhattan is having an electric light muddle too. Resub3iission is so dead that talk about it is almost a chestnut. Congressman Harrison Ejxley has been placed on the committee on accounts. These be panicky times. Half the papers in the state are clawing at the other half. And Emin Pasha is to die after all. The world's stock of noted men seems to be decreasing. Xoav that Jeff is dead will the Junc tion City Tribune give up calling it "Davis county?" The democratic papers are not pleased with Mr. Harrison's message. That means it is a good one. "Those who have steers to shed pre pare to shed them now," is the classic agricultural advice of an exchange. TnE Hutchinson Xews has a column headed "Kansas Klatter." There seems to be something loose about it. TorEKA is thirty-five years old and still growing older. She is a frisky and and vivacious creature nevertheless. Congress should mean business from the word go. It is business and not monkey-work that the people look for and desire at present. The fact that the Roman number of the present congress is LI does not necessarily indicate that the members will not stick to the truth. The Wichita Joural says we have "the pouts." That is a mean word to be fling at a fellow just because he criticised the Journal a little. The McPherson Republican says that $300,000 have been paid out in that county this year for broom corn. One dealer alone paid out $105,000 for this product. The defaulting cashier of the house of representatives was a remnant of the old democratic administration. Too bad that all the rascals were not turned out sooner. The central figure in the south's list of noted men has passed away. Jeff Davis was a man of great energy, great organizing power but he used them in a wrong.cause. We wonder if a prominent attorney of the city does not feel that be has gone a good deal out of his way to make a very small exhibition of himself in this week's Chronicle. Senator Vest allows no dress suits at his suppers. He is probably making a bid for the vote of the backwoods grangers of Missouri who dressin jeans pants nd cotton shirts. Senator Ingadls has been re-elected vice-president pro tern, that is, he will take Mr. Morton's place when that gentleman is absent. It is going to be pretty hard to down a man with a grip like that. The last of the four men who in 186-1 were of national prominence on the national tickets has just died. They were Abraham Lincoln, Geo.B.McClel lan, Andrew Johnson aDd Geo. H. Pendleton. Talmage is following up Paul's journeys. It is hardly likely that his sermons on the way will be as long re membered as the Apostle's, but he is having more fun and making more money on the trip. The amount offered by the govern ment for the alleged Indian title to the Cherokee Strip is S7,113.S46, which would yield, at 5 percent, interest, over $350,000 a year. If the red-skins are wise, they'll take it. The Paisons Eclipse is the newest daily paper of the metropolis of the southeast. With three dailies Parsons ought to survive the winter. The Eclipse starts in bright enough to sur vive its competitors at least. , Fire-proof and time-proof books, with leaves and covers of sheets of asbestos and printing in gold or silver letters, hayj been suggested. In this way, and this way only, can some authors' works become indestructible. Some enlightened individual pre sented the pupils of the deaf and dumb institution atrOlathe with a jewsharp last week and the Star wickedly sug gests that it-will now be in- order for some one to give the inmates of the blind asylum a spy-glass. While Sam Jones was preaching in Kentucky on bringing up children an old blue-grass fellow said: " We raise horses and bring up children." "Yes," retorted Sam, "you raise horses worth $50,000 apiece and bring up children worth about $3 a head." The old soldiers are getting their first remittances from the new pension agenf, 'Kelly:' It is not likely that Mip money will g- any further than wli-ii Glick signed the checks, but it doubt less seems better to the pensioners. Martin of Salina thought himself the finest reader in America but the house of representatives bounced him after one day of his Salina brogue. The mere fact thafa man comes from Sa lina works against him everywhere. The Wichita Journal puts the word Journal in small caps when it occurs in the congressional proceedings. This is as bad as the Xew York Herald which once printed the- famous hymn as "Hark, The Herald angels sing." Western Kansas is said to be going into the winter in excellent shape. There has an abundance of rain fallen and the wheat will be better prepared for the cold weather than ever before. If the year is prosperous the western part of the state will come to the front again. Senator Pdumb yesterday intro duced bills in the senate to erect pub lic buildings; one at Emporia, Kas., to cost $100,000; at Kansas City, Kas., to cost $200,000, and at Salina, Kas., to cost $150,000. Mr. Plumb, Abilene is to be the future capital of Kansas. Be ware how you slight her. Indications point to the fact that Henry M. Stanley will eat English roast beef and plum pudding in London at Christmas. And if his welcome is not sufficiently enthusiastic in that conser vative old town let him take the City of Paris for ew York, and Americans will see what they can do on New Year's day Did the State Journal have the Dick inson County News in its mind's eye when it said yesterday: A worse plague than the old saloon is the small resubmission democratic paper that afflicts many Kansas towns. Its effect on the community is something like that of a leaky sanitary wagon. It only succeeds in polluting the atmosphere. Here are a few dates of interest: 1776 The United States of America. 1824 The United States of Mexico. 1S61 The United States of Columbia. 1S61 The United States of Venezuela. 1889 The United States of Brazil. Will there ever be the United States of North and South America, and how soon? Ex. It is said that Mr. Cleveland nowa days moves at a slow and ponderous gait, and seldom smiles. Even at a theater the expression of his face is habitually solemn and morose, though the play may be shriekingly funny. Grover is painfully aware thathis goose as a public man is forever cooked and the white house has taken its place in the past forever. A large amount of gush is being wasted over the fate of Igoe, the asso ciated press reporter lost in the Trib une fire at Minneapolis. As a matter of fact he seems to have stayed at his wire to send an unimportant message when he was told to escape. He fell, the victim of his own delay. He helped nobody by staying, and butfor the fact that he is dead would be severely cen sured. Blatherskite Claiborne in his pretended reply to the Reflector fails to deny the charge that he "was a rebel all through the war and never voted the republican ticket until he came to Abilene and theu did so for boodle." In fact, he couldn't after telling the facts about town and then begging his hearers "not to tell' it, asit would hurt him in pulling the wool over the eyes of the republicans." The Wichita Journal would like some one of the brilliant brains of Kan sas to give us new expressions for the following which have grown threadbare and chestnutty: "Alone with his God and a lead pencil," "Dull thud," "Chestnuts," "O, mamma," "Atrench- ant pen," "Lurid flames," "Conven tional black," "(Hie)," "Ye Editor," "Rats," "The blushing bride," "It's a boy," "Parts his name in the middle," "Pants," "What's in a name," "Pro hibition cranks," "Whisky soaks," "W," "Napoleon of Finance," "e. c," "Where did yu get that hat," "In the soup." When the south has enjoyed a free ballot and a fair count of it for a short term of years it will wonder at the patience with which it endured a long reign of oligarchs who ruled by fraud and force. There are thousands of im migrants and millions of money wait ing to enter the southern tier; their advent is delayed solely by the absence of respect for law and the paucity of free schools. The negro question will subside as soon as white immigrants reduce the relative numerical force of the colored people and new capital establishes new industries which will create new issues upon which both the colored and the white voters willdivide in the south, as they now divide in the nor tli, A democrat can get a great deal of consolation out of very small favors. The republican caucus named a chap lain for the house of representatives. Upon the final vote iu the house a number of the republican members voted for Mr. Milburn, who was the former chaplain and a blind' man. Doubtless their votes were cast out of sympathy for the man's misfortune. The office is in no sense a political one, and has never been so regarded. But the poor, defeated democracy claims this act of charity as a democratic victory. The politicians who are advocating a constitutional convention ought to tell us just what part of the state con stitution they would change, leave out or add to. It is easy enough for a man who would like to be a delegate to a state constitutional convention to say he favors a new constitution, but the reasons for a change are what the voters would like to hear. The adop tion of a new constitution would cost the state a half million dollars. There must be some pressing need for this lirge expenditure of money before the people will authorize it. Be explicit, gentlemen, and tell us just what you want to put in or leave out of your new constitution. If the change promises to be worth its cost, it may be made, otherwise the people will manage to jog along under our present laws. The average review of a president's message is a delusion and a snare. The document is too long for a detailed criticism and only the chief points can be touched upon, and those only in the briefest manner. President Harrison's message is being received by the press of the country with general satisfac tion. It is a careful, conservative yet able exposition of republicanism and its present plans for the upbuilding of the nation. It impresses the reader as the work of a thoughtful, business-like 3tudent of public affairs and one who has only the United States' best inter ests at heart. Its suggestions are all in the line of progress, and if they can be followed by congress most benificent results will come. There are no individual, pig-headed eccentric ities such as made Cleveland famous all recommendations appeal directly to the good judgment of thinking citizens. The South. American Trade. The proceedings of the Pan-American congress-, have impelled a democratic exchange to turn loose its dogs of war on the great bugaboo of the democracy, "the robber, tariff," and declare with all the solemnity of a brainless owl that we are losing a large amount of South American trade because South Ameri can products are shut out of our mar kets by the tariff on imports. The well-informed free traders will feel very badly,indeed,when these "out rageous arrows" strike them. If there be one argument stronger than another against the "reciprocal distribution" theory of the free traders, it is found in the conditions of free trade between the United States and the states of South and Central America. We buy more from them and sell less to them than England does. According to the "reciprocal distribution" theory "we ought to sell more because we buy more. That a large number of South American products are shut out of our market by the tariff is a false assump tion. The exchange referred to has picked up a piece of clay and mistaken it for a flint stone. The truth is that a larger quantity of South American products comes into our market than info the markets of any other country of the world. Nor does our tariff either exclude or limit importation; it is inoperative so far as the chief prod- I' ucts of the Southern and Central Amer ican states are concerned. What are the chief products? Coffee, India rubber, guano, hides, hoops, horns and other glue materials, cocoa, arrow root, cin namon bark, mahogany, rosewood, ;satinwood, ebony and "all cabinet woods;" every one of which is duty free by the tariff now in force. Our con temporary deals a fierce blow upon its free-trade friends when it charges limi tation of trade with South America to the operation of the tariff. We sell far more to England, most of whose .important products we tax, than to South America, whose principal pro ducts we admit duty free, i We do not get our share of the trade ;ivith Southern and Central America be ;jaase, aud solely because, England pro jects her ships by bounties and subsi dies, while we have drifted into the jfree-trade policy of witholding subsi dies. English ships are found in the ports and harbors of Southern and Cen tral America, and United States ships are not. Now ships create trade, just as railways do. Tho perfection of the plan of protection to American indus tries includes such liberal ship subsi dies as England gives; when that stage of perfection is reached the .balance of trade will be in our favor. Not till then. Gray and dry hair will become dark and moist by the use of Hall's HairBe-newer. I THE
