ThB people of these United tftates who are id accord with Republican principals will read with pleasure, pride, and profit tho Message of Gcnerl Grant, which will be found elsewhere iu ouf columns. Those who are Dot in such accord will Hud iu it ruuoh matter suggestive 6f thought, and uoae to give offence. A state paper it ranks among the ablest 6f productions. There is Done of that dti'gtDa'ffeui that in An drew Joh'Dson's papers" results Congress and the people, uor fs there any of that indifference to established faets which threw Johnson so fat back 6'f the moving, think, ing prescot. It comports as nearly h may bo with the popular idea of a Message. Wherein it refers to completed lines of pol icy the reasons aro n6vcr withhold, and wherein these Hoes art' foreshadowed, it is done in that suggest! iS style which invites the oo-operatiou of Congress and insures its confidence. In its scope the Messaged not more general than others ; ia its grasp of issues it will stand as a model. Its one great characteristic is the hearty endorse, rjent it gives to those principals which car ried the war to a successful termination, and that now would not allow any of its lessons to escape. Tho initial period of the Administration is over. It has had time to cast its horoscope. Regarding the Message as the embodiment of administrative tiiouht and predilection, it is so pre-eminently Re publican as to doubly vindicate the wisdom f selecting its author as Chief Executive of tho nation. The Message opens with a glowing sketch of the National coudition. lilessod with pcQco, all are left free to study the vast re sources and contemplate the features that make this people to prosperous, uuitcd, and happy. Our areas are ample for five hundred million souls. Tho land abounds in mineral and agricultural wealth. Here tho most benign institutions, whether ol learning, religion, philanthropy, law or lib erty, have their raise nud enjoy a patronage unequalcd among civilized nations. One speech, and that thu English, is common - to forty million inhabitants, and is a per.' petual bond of unity and homogeueily the very touchstone of republican institu tions. The work of Congress iu restoring the long-lost Sta'.es, and protecting and foster ing free labor and freedom, is approved. While all the results may not bo juite sat isficfactory, yctepough success hss becu achie'ed to prove beyond doubt tho justice of the procedure, and to show that different counsels would have been attended with disaatrous delays, or would have jeopard ised the sword wrought logic of the rebel lion. There is no miucing of words respecting the Southern situation. Take tho cato ol Georgia as an illustration. A constitution was adopted ; members of the Legislature were elected. A part of thnt Legislature expelled another part, in contravention ul tho State constitution they had just adopted, and iu violation of the fourteenth amend mcnt to the Federal Constitution. O'.her members were substituted who were ineli gible, according to the same high author ities. The Supreme court of Georgia has, besides, decided that the expelled mem bers were eligible and that tho substituted ones were not. This is the case, simply, tersely stated. The remedy suggested is the enactment of a general law requireing an obedience to the State and Federal com pacts. There is no talk of expedients here ; no shuffling, temporising suggestions. The caso is understood and is squarely met. The law in the hands of Grant will be am pie. The rresidettt looks upon the work ac complished in Virginia with an eye of sat- faction. Perhaps ho is a little too compla cent here. True, the letter of the law may have been fulfilled, but its spirit has been violated. However, the consefjueuses be upon the State. The Executive could not fathom intentions, and the autorities ean only deal with acts, ' Turning to the fiuances, the President avows the desirability of an uuvarying me dium of circulation. The present currency he regards as a uccessary evil growing out of the war, but he d es not in sult the Congress with its presence, as did his predescssor, neither does he, like him, iurent an ingenious plan for repudiating tho debt. Early resumption is advised, yet by early resumption is meant such a re sumption as will bo fair to the debtor clas. aos. The ruin that would follow a hasty leap from a currency to a gold circulation is fully set forth. Among the infinitude of plana proposed by which to transfoiui tho money medium, the Presdent sees but one that is conceived to be available. Let the Treasury redeem its paper at a fixed price whenever preseuted, and let it with, hold all currency so redeemed until fold gun for gold. Approval is given to the scheme of funding the debt at a lower rate of interest, and the making of our bonds payable at one or moro of tho European money centres. The President has full faith in tbe financial ttrength of the natron, and regards the extinguishment of tho debt as a matter easy of accomplishment at an early day. His position on the tnriffhns been already anticipated by the action of tho Ways and Means Committee ol the House. Tbe re quirements of the Government are annually diminishing, thanks to Republican re trenchment and reform, and if a funding bill should pans a great saving iu interest would be effected. These things consider ed, wherein the tariff is solely for revenue its modification is advised. The principle of protection is left intact, and, we take it, has tho e ndorsesient of the President. Touching CuVan affairs, the Presideut adheres to the line of absolute right as laid down by the law of nations and recog nized by local enactments. Tho direction and eitet,t of sympathy iu this country is well understood, aud ife individual wishes Were law there could be no difficulty about recognizing Cuban beligctetey. Rut un happily there are constraining influences, which, to disregard, might precipitate war, a thing to be deprecated1 by every citizen. To this position the charge of uatioual cowardice is lo answer. It is nothing but an undignified taunt, a virtual confession of a weak oause. The President is not afraid of his position'. All tho past is an echo of tbe fact that the Government of the United States has dared to do right, come what would. After glancing at tho dcbartmcntal re ports, the President lays down the broad platform which he adopted as the guide to his administration. It is the gist of his mes. sage, aud mora than that, it is the refinement of advanced Republicanism. There is not a patriot in the laud but who will subscribe to the' brief political creed he enunciates, aud, if more were needed to establish its rightfulness, it may bo found is tho fact we anticipate, that there is not a Demccratic partitau in the laud who will uot denounce it. At the instance of tire Executive, nego tiations concerning the Alabama claims were purposely discontinued until the ex citement in both Countries over the rejec tion of the treaty by the American Senate was alloyed. There is, however, no pur pose evinced to abandon them. On the contrary, the defects of the treaty are clearly pointed out, aud the character of the issues which must meet settlement is fully desig nated. A reciprocity treaty between 'be United States aud Canada is looked upon as a species oi unwarrantable favoritrsai to ward the peoplo of the Domiuion, aud as such a discrimination against the citizens of this country. The Indian policy is looked upou as an experiment which promises well. We cannot better concludo this review than by givir.g it : I'itst. A strict integrity in fulfilling all our obligations. Second. To secure protection to the per son and property of the citizen ot tho Uuitcd States in caoh and every portion of our common country, wheiever be may choose to move, without reference lo orig inal nationality, religion, co'or, or politics, demanding of him only obedience to the iaws and proper respect for the rights of others. Third. Uuion of all the States, with equal rights iudestructible by any consti. tutional menus Phila. Prett. Don't bk Extiiavaoant. If the poor house has any terrors lor you, never buy what jou don't need, jjefore you pay three cents for a jew's harp, my boy, ascertain .whether you can't make just as unpleasant a noi.-e by whistlig, for which nature fumUhes the machinery. And before you pay $75 for a coat, young man, find out whether your lady-love would not be just as glad to see you iu one that would cost half the money. If she would not, let her crack her own hazel-nuts and buy her owu clothes. ben you see a man spending two or three dollars a week fooliahly, the chances aro five to one he'll livo long enough to know how mauy ceuts there are in a dollar, oud if he don't, he's pretty sure to bequeath that privilege to his widow. When a man asks you to buy that for which you have no use, no mattei how cheap t is, don't say yes until you aro sure some one elee wants it in aurauce. Money burns iu eonin folks' pockets, and makes such a big hole that everything that is put in drops through, past finding. The returns from Mississippi indicate the election ol Gen. Alcorn, the Republican candidate lor Governor, by a large majority with a Legislature to match; aud the few returns from Texas give assurance of iho triumph of Gen A. J. Hamilton by a deci sive majority. These are the results which have boeu for soma time enticipatcd by in tellitient politicians. We do not doubt thit they may be accepted as securing the ratification ol tiioXVth Auicudweut ly ' those Suits. . oii.jux iii..xt,nk. ill id Tannery which has been uuder construction for sev eral years ia now nearly completed. It is the largest in the United States. The buildings are beautifully constructed with good finish and handily arranged. The vats number over eight hundred and some of them are very large. They are now fin. itdiing, and shiping, about forty tuns of sole-leather per week. Tho dry house and rolling mills are iu a sepcrato department. We do not knov what the size of this spacious building is, but is easily seen from the P. & E. R. R., to be seven stories high. All its inside machinery works as perfect and oasy as a clock. Mr. Schulta was the designer of this great establishment but Mr. Allen, the boss mechanic, has gained a high reputation by his ingenuity and skill in the cousttuction of those mammoth buil dings. The dwelling houses for the em ployees of this taDncry number about one hundred, besides the shanties that are scat, tered through the dense forest where they peel the bark from the timber of hundreds of acres yearly to supply the tannciy. The Tanning Company Storo is the largest in this couutry and its extensive variety of goods is, probably not excelled in the state. The Tanning & Lumbering Co. saw mill at this place attracts much attention ; it Contains a gang Of seventeen saws, one cir cular and one upright saw, plaining mill, lath mill, suingle mill, wood mill, machine ry for manufacturing picket fence and other mechanical arrangements for finish ing up building material, aH in one buil ding and drove by ono power. Dressing tour Wife. You wish to dress your wife better thau your circumstan ces will allow. She wauts to have you. She- is a woman of spirit, it is said, aud docs not mean to be a drudge. "Why should ewur neighbors," she says to her husband, "dress any better than wo? They are made of the same flesh and blood that we are. Sec how they come out. I don't think any man of spirit would let his wife and chil li en go to church dressed as you let us go. Look at these children. You would think they had just come out of sorrfe slop house. If I had married as I might have married, we should have had different times I and my childicn now many men are stung to the quick by such remarks from their wifes. Often times their moral sense re volts, at Erst, and they feel indignation; but ,:contiuual dropping wears a stone," and by-and by the man is dressed a little better than he can afford ; and somebody must pay lor tho extravagance. I do not mean thai ' they are tempted to steal j but! do say i'nar they grind. They moan somehow to got it ont of the milliner, out of the dress maker, or out of the merchaot. They intend to make one hand wash the other somehow aud they, go into petty meanness to bring it about. And this desire to dress better thau they can afford is taking off tho very enamel of their virtue, and taking out the very stamina ot their relijrioui life. Unimpor tant as it seems, ostentatious vanity in dress has ruined many a family, aud darned, many a soul. Rev. Henry Ward livelier. A
