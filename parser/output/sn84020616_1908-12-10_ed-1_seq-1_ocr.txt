BIG INJUNCTION CASE OF FOREST BURNED EVERYJEAR Fire Is of Greatest Menace to Future Lumber Supply of United States. SMALL PERCENTAGE 0FJTIM8ER USED Only 320 Feet of Lumber Market ed for 1.000 Feet cut and Effort Should bo Made to Save 1 his Waste. "Washington, Dec. 10. Forest pre ervatlon was the principal topic at the Joint conference of governors and the conservation commission here to fiey. The report of the forest sec tion was made by Senator Reed Emoot, of Utah, chairman of the sec tlon. and hto report was a summary of the great mass of statistics which -tha flrst Inventory represents. In part the report says: What We Have. Our forests now cover 550 million acres, or about one-fourth of the United States. The original forests covered not less than 850 million acres, or nearly one-half. Forests publicly owned cover one- fourth of the total forest area, and contain one-fifth of all timber stand ing. Forests privately owned cover three-fourths of the" area, and con tain four-fifths of the standing tim ber. The timber privately owned Is not only four times that publicity owned, but it is generally more val uable. 11 ;JJ , Forestry is now practiced on 70 per cent of the forests publicly own ed and on less than one per cent of the forests privately owned, or on only 18 per' cent of the total forest .area. v '- " " ., , ' What Is produced. The yearly growth of wood In our forests does not average more than 11 cubic feet per acre. This gives a total yearly growth of less than seven billion cubic feet. What Is I'sed. We take yearly, Including waste in logging and in manufacture, 23 bil lion cubic feet of wood from oar for We use each year 100 million. cord3 of firewood. 40 billion feet of lumber. more than a billion posts, pol and fence rails, 118 million hewn ttcf, 1V4 iblllion st-avee, over 133 million sru of headingfl, nearly 500 million bar rel hoops, 3 million cords of native pulpwood, 165 million cubfc feet of round mine timbers, and 11 million cords of wood for dintilntton. What I Wasted". Since 1870, forest fires have each year destroyed an s-wrage, of 50 lives and 50 million d'jTIars' worth of tlm "... Cfot less t'tnn 50 million actis " "over yearly. standing timber lost In 1 lgging. af pine for tur- 'ed one-fifth of The loss in the d to two-third 1 The loss in Ugh seasoning from one-siv- er are used jtood In the each year re, 3 ed less seven of all risen con water or . an practically sti, Are: at a total yearly cost of of? -th the value of the standing tlmb.-r burned eacn ear, not counting young growth. We shall suffer for timber to meet our ntieds, until our iorems nave had time to grow again. But If we act vigorously and at once, we shall escape permanent timber scarcity. What Mut lie Done. For each million acres of forest In public ownership, over three million are privately owned. The conserva tion of public forests is the smaller task before the nation and the states. The larger task to to induce private forest owner, which means three million men to take enre of what they have, and to teaoh wood users, which means every one, how not to waste. If these things are done, they will conserve our streams as well a our forests. If they are not done, the usefulness of our streams will de crease no less than the usefulness of our forests. The report of the waterways sec tlon was made by Theodore Burton, chairman. It said In part: In the Atlantic-Interior system, there should be a- 'deep waterway from Gulf of Maxlco to the Great Lakes, and a deep and continuous Atlantic Inner passage from New England to Florida: the present plan for Improving the Ohio should be carried out promptly, and should be perfected by any forestatlon and res ervoirs required to control the head waters; the upper Mississippi and the Missouri should be improved ana canalized; the lower Mississippi should be connected with the Rio Urande and with the waters of Florida by Inner passages; the navigable riv ers flowing into Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic ocean should be Improved; and all appropriate links In the sys tem should be adapted to vessels of standard draft, and should be con nected with one another and with the Great Lakes by canals, of standard di mensions. In the Columbla-Puget system, the rivers should be Improved and requisite connecting canals snouiu be constructed; and in California, Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Feather Rivers should be so improved as to oDen the country to Interstate and foreign cbommerce. It has been roughly estimated that the Inland waterways of the country could be Improved In 10 years at a cost of S50.000.000 annually in such manner as to promote interstate com merce and at the same time greatly reduce the waste and extend the use of the waters. - -

The meetinic to be held this even ing at the Commercial club was called by the officers of the club and Is for the nuroose of giving the properly owners of the city a fair opportunity to consider the matter of building a sewer. The importance of the meet ing cannot be denied. If there is any thing that the progress of the city depends on more Mian a new sewer system, Albuquerque Business ' men have not discovered It as jet. The city Is gettftig along with the present very lnueo,uate system at a monthly expense of over $200. This money is spent every month to keep the present system working, and then there Is no telling when some part of it will give away, submerging gome part of the city with poisonous sewer age. The experience encountered on South Second street argue well thW point. Th meeting tonight will be called U order at o'clock, and any inter ested party will be welcome to make expression of views. Mr. Bullock, who ix here from Kansas City repre senting a company which proposes to build the new system, will be one of the principal speakers. KX
