( Ctmt Inutil from lrt jxigtt.) 6u 8 of 1800 is rejoiced over, though for party renaona the service wan put In charge of a political adventurer, whose repudiation of everything almont that boro on civil service, was patent to the eyo of the careful observer. Hut the jllmax Is capped when the president avers: The law relating to the civil sorvico has, - no far an I can learn, Leon executed by thoao havingtho power of appointment in the classified service with fidelity and im partiality, and the service has been increas ingly satisfactory.

Let the casual observer but notice the following congratulations: ' '' I congratulate the Congress and the coun try upon the passage ot the first session of the Fifty-first Congress of an unusual num ber of laws of very high importance. That the renults of thin legislation will be the Juickoning and enlargement of our mnnu acturing industries, larger and better mar ket for our breadstuff and provisions both at home and abroad, more constant em ployment and better wages for our working people and an increased supply of a nafe ourrenoy for the transaction of buslnoHs I do not doubt. Home of these measures were enaotod at ho late a period that the beneficial effects upon commerce which wore in the contemplation of Congress have ai yet Due partially maniroHtou tnemsoives. The general trauo and industrial condi tions throughout the country during the year have shown a marked improvement. Let these Kansas people who heilpod to make the no-called ,lB'-!,000 Harrison and Morton majority," ask themselvoa how llteially true It la, an far us their experi ence and observation goes, that in conse quence of "the pasnage at the first ses sion, of the Fifty-first Congress of an unusual number of laws of very high Im portance," there have been tine visible "results of better markets for our bread Btuffs and provisions both At homo and abroad, more constant employment and bettor wages for our working people and an increased supply of a safe currency for the transaction of buslnes," and that "the general trade and industrial condi tions throughout the country during the year have shown a marked improve ment." Are not such declarations in an official paper of a supposed high standing in affairs of otate, needlessly tantAllzlng to thoce who bear the severe burdens con sequent upon light wages for exhaustive labor, bo that the privileged classes whom President Harrison specially represent may harvest more abundant dividends from the toil of the land and from the bounteous products of the earth, that they can be able to so most effectually corner, rnd through subdlzed legislation under their control securoly make the rich richor and the poor poorer? Must it be considered to be a ' public duty on the part of the twenty-third president of the United Btatea to weave such sophisms In a message to Congress and Interject a stump speech in this im portant state paper? 

SHOULD NOT A rilEHIDEJiT OK TIIK NATION HAVK PAIR INTELLIGENCE? Tub Advocate submits that It might bo eminently In order for our president to employ a Bpeclal clerk, who might de vote a moiety of his time In collecting some Information relating to the condi tion of the great industrial maasea, who toil In fields and In shops, so that In the next annual message to the people's rep reeentatJvoa who will largely be a dif ferent class from the present parasites of thia national administration he need not thrust such moauinontal ignorance as the following matter develops upon the patient, loyal tollers of America: . . Mining in coal has had no limitation ex- cept that resulting. frOivi deficient transpor tatiou. The general testimony is that lubor is everywhere fully employed, and the re port from tho lout year show a smaller number of employes affected by strikes and lockout than m any other year since The depression in tho price of agricultural roductrt had boon greatly depressed and a uoyant and hopeful tone was beginning to bo felt by all our people. These promising influuncoH have boon in Homo degree checked by the surprising and very unfavorable monetary events which have recently taken nice in juigianu. it in gratirylng to know lint these did not irrow in ntiv deirren out of tho financial relations of London with our people or out of any diheredit attached to our securities hold in that market. 1 he re turn of our bonds and stocka was caused by a money stringency In England, and not by any loss of value or credit in tho securities themselves. Wo could not, however, wholly escape the ill effects of a foreign monetary agitation, accompanied by such extraordi nary incidents an characterized thin. It in not believed, however, that theso evil inci dents, which have for tho timo unfavorably affected values in this country, can long withstand tho Btrong, safe and wholesome influences whioh aro oporatingtoglve to our feople profitable returns In all branches of egitimato trade and induHtry. 

IIIH OPEN PEKENSK OK TIIK m'RINLRY ACT. Let the Intelligent school boy but ro llect upon the quality of the president's statesmanship in the following: Tho apprehension that our tariff may again and at once be subject to important general changes would undoubtedly add a depressing influence of the moHt serious character. Tho general tariff act has only partially gono into operation, some of its important proviHions being limited to take effect at future dates. Tho general provisions of the law have boen in force Iohh than sixty days. Its permanent effect on trade and prices still largely stand in conjecture. It is curious to note that tho advance in prices of articles wholly unaffected by tho act was by many hastily ascribed to that act. Notice was not latum or uio ract mat the cenerai tendency of tho markets was upward from influences wholly apart from tho late tnritfl legislation. Senator John (.Carlisle, of Kentucky, for six years speaker of the American House of Representatives, has thus fitly and forcibly spoken upon the mass of vagaries the president has seetnod anx ious to launch upon his countrymen In hls.incomparably stupid advocacy of Buch a mass of monHtrosltlos as are sadly vital ized In the McKinley act: Harrison is evidently going to die in the last ditch with the radicals of his party and keep on defending tho tariff bill to the very last, notwithstanding tho popular verdict against it. He complains, as his party asso ciates complain since the election, that tho people did not understand the bill. As a matter of fact tho people understood it too well. In the House of Representatives dis cussion was shut off in order to prevent tho democrats from exposing the iniquities of the bill for the benefit of the people, and in tho Senate there was a continual complaint on the part of the republicans that the dem ocrat!) were occupying time unnecessarily in discussing tho bill. Thus it will be seen that the people either understood it or tho republicans tried to prevent them from un derstanding, and they can accept whichever horn of the dilemma they chooso. 

PALTBHINO AND PITIFUL SPECIAL PI.KAD INO OK TIIK CHIEF EXEUCTIVK. What a chapter of facts, hey, President Harrison presents to a humiliated sot of defeated partisans, who listen to the fol lowing rigmarole, which even burdana them In their attitude to their constitu ents, who have been most unmercifully taxed through tholr votes that enacted the burdensome law to the people which the president made effective by hia gracious signature: No bill was evor framed, I suppose, that in all its rates and olassifloatioiw had the full approval even of a party caucus. Such legislation it) always and noceesarily tho product of compromise as to dotails, and the present law is no exception, but in its general scope and effect I think it will jus tify the support of those who believe that American legislation should oonsorvo and defend American trade and the wages of American workmen. The misinformation as to the terms of the not which has been So widely disseminated at home and abroad will be corrected by experience and the evil auguries aa to its results confoundod by the market reports, tho savings banks, interna tional trade balances and the general profc- Eerity of our people. Already we begin- to ear from abroad and from our custom houses that the prohibitory elfect upon im portations imputed to tho act ia not justified. Would the president soek to mislead the great American people by Insinuat ing that the trade relations of thin na tion, through a seriously Injured com merce presont and prospective are really all right with the nations friendly to us, say France, (Jerniany and Mexico? THE 

KCDEIIAL ELECTIONS HILL IIAK KIHO.n'h PIIIDK. The prBldent seems to glory In his con tinued devotion to the so-called federal elections bill and virtually makes an In exorable demand for fresh legislation on this subject. The inherent beauties of the Henry Cabot Lodge bill, which has passed the House of Representatives and Is now receiving the attention of the Senate have been partially portrayed by Hon. A. W. Shaffer, a southern republi can, who h chief federal supervisor of elections In the Btate of North Carolina. He spoaks as follows: Tho work of tho chief supervisor of elec tions for 1HKH commenced in early August for tho eastern district of North Carolina and continued until late in Decoraber nearly livo months. It related chielly to the dotails of the selection, appointment, instruction, direction and control of some 1100 supervisors and tho proper disposition of their reports and returns. There were no deputy marshals, no paid supervisors and no city canvassers. After tho account of the chief supervisor for that service had run tho gauntlet of the court and of tho ac counting olllcors of tho treasury, he realized therefrom tho net sum of If I!.'l..'i0 that is to Bay about $1 per day. Meanwhile the account of tho clerk of tho court for two days' work of himself and of his deputy in filling up, signing, soaling and recording supervisor's commission was $7l!.0T that is to say $:i74.fi2 por day. Tho Lodge bill proposes to take from tho clerk and put upon the chief supervisor this two days' work, amounting to $719.05, without compensation. Uesidos, it adds four supervisors for every precinct, for wniuu mo aggregate ieos oi me ciera wouiu be $2,247.15, but for whioh the chief super visor would roceive absolutely nothing. There is fullv .'MX) nor cent, mora work nut upon the chief by the now than by the old act; but his compensation is still dependent upon the ridiculous item of papers tiled at ten cents each an item which bears no moro proportion to the amount of work performed than a dewdrop bears to tho ocean, and may reach, all told, $1.W) por day. True, there ore some luxuries, but thoy are exponsive to a man ou day laborer's wages. He may have a deputy and a chief clerk, but he must pay both from his own salary. He may bring one action in the circuit court and another in the court of claims every day, if his little fees are not "paid on the nail;" but ho cannot suo in forma pauperis, nor have the United States attorney assigned as counsel. Under tho provisions of this bill tho board of stato canvassers, of which there are to be three members, receive $20 a day each and have a clerk to do their work at $12 a day, not paid from their salaries. WhilA thin clerk tabulates the returns, tho members of the board may inhale thoir ogygen in tho mountains and their o.ono by the sea, limited only as to time and expense by thoir ortlcial consciences in certification, upon salaries W) per cent, above that of a United States Senator. It is not surprising that the original act of 1871 should contain some inequalities of compensation, arising from unfamiliarity with tho dutios of a class of onlcors whose bills of costs even the accomplished experts of the treasury never yet adjusted twice alike: but to reenact the ridiculous pro visions of that law twenty years later, and, in addition, to Increase by SCO per cent, the labor of ono oftlcer without reasonable, not to say decent, compensation, while creating others with nominal duties and Joitraordin ary salaries and clerical aid, may well sub ject its promoters to severe criticism, if not to the suspicion of inexcusable ignorance or of the attempt to handicap the law with provisions so repulsive aa to render its effec tive execution impracticable. Mr. Shaffer, whoso article ia In the North American llcritw for November, 1890, thus concludes: In conclusion; It has dawned upon the intellect of those who have borno the brunt of tho political crimes for the last twenty live years that their experience and opinions are neither sought nor accepted, nor do they Kass current in nigh places; that when they ave asked for bread, thoy have received a stone; and when they sought a national sys tem of Congressional olootions a system that would be neither evadod nor annulled lo! there is tendered this miserable carica ture of a long dead and forgotten ntatute, valuable only for the spoilsman, and fairly reeking with fraud, violence, and blood, bo causo both threatening and impotent. Who shall judge them if, in the bitterness of de ferred hope and violated promises, they cry aloud for delivorance from theee thoir friends? Perhaps It Is fitting that nenry Cabot Lodge, of MaanachuBiitts, whose w ife baa a large bank account, and who has per mitted him to Ufie what has boen needful in hia Congressional campaigns to secure votes for himself at the polls, phould push the federal election bill, but what can be thought of this testimony of Mr. Shaffer? It need be no wonder that patriotic citizens all over our common country should proclaim the doctrine of "home rule," and no foreign Interference with local elections, leoutwlae ceaHe to re inaugurate a system which places troops at the polls In times of peace, where In terested politicians at Washington, D.C., and elsewhere may direct. Has President Harrison ever given any serious thought to the Australian ballot system, which may bo counted oh a great safeguard against organized ignorance assaulting the sanctity of the ballot, and the main abolition of extensive republi can boodle at the polls, even In Kanaaa? The president's message Is brought to a close In the following language: The preparation of gonoral appropriation bills should bo conducted with the groatont care and tho closest scrutiny of expendi tures. Appropriations should bo adequate to the noeds of public service, but they should bo absolutely free from prodigality. I venture again to remind you that tho brief time romaining for tho consideration of tho important legislation now awaiting your at tention offers no margin for waste. If tho present duty is discharged with diligenco, fidelity and courage, tho work of tho Fifty llrst Congress may bo confidently submit ted to the considerate judgment of tho peo ple. There are matters related to the mes sage that may deserve and require later attention. W.cTl'. u. For (iod and Home mid Native Land. To the Editor of Tiik Advocate. 1 The first annual convention of the non partisan W. C. T. U. was held In Htta burgh, Pennsylvania, beginning Novem ber 19. In speaking of the two branches, the partisan and non-partisan, and the probability of their being united, Mrs. Phlnney thought no overtures would be made at this session. A merited tribute was given In the report to tho active Co operation of the Y's, a junior organiza tion of the union. Tho necessity of es tablishing a national paper waa urged. Gratitude was exgretsed to Congresa for their recognition of the evil effect of the original package system. The Central Michigan W. C. T. U. have unanimously decided that cider aiid ginger ale are Intoxicating, and to drink them ia a violation of the pledge. Tho delegates to the W. C. T. U. convention at Atlanta, Georgia, spent a day at In dian Springs, where It is proposed to, es tablish an inebriate asylum under tjie auspices of the National V. C. T, .U. Speeches were made and a banquet waa given the visitors. A site and nucleus of the fund Is offered by Indian Springs for the establishment of such an institution. The waters there aro famous and it ia claimed they furnish a sure cure for the whisky habit. Miss Willard, in her address to tho na tional convention at Atlanta, cnat a line toward the husbandman not matri monial cord, however. . She said: "The farmers are the mightiest single force in the land for prohibition. They are our natural allies. Walt for the wagon, the solid old farm wagon, and we'll all take a rid." x. X.
