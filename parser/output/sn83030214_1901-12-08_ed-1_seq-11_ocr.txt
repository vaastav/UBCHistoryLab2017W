MUSIC. THE PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY. A novelty was produced at the second concert of tvg philharmonic Society last evening, but, while j-^Ta-.5.-. curiosity and gave much pleasure, It was o »ar below two other numbers on the programme *f matter cf artistic value and Interest that !• asgfet :c walt tUI they are 08 * 3 of in a re- * e-?re -?r of the concert. The two numbers were not I^» though the older and the work of the v- Tjeme rr.after In music was less familiar than the Epjgjer They were Beethoven's second "Leonore" ivertjre and Tscbalkowskys "Pathetic" sym islscsj-- Tbe name of the former, -when the num ber is ignored, has a familiar sound, but it appears tot rarely on our concert programmes, and when jt does appear, as yesterday, it raises questions which, perhaps, might better be discussed in pro fessional than in amateur circles. There is no more jnciliar or admired orchestral composition of Bee tiicver's than the "Leonore No. 3" overture.- It Is t milestone in the musical art, a masterpiece, a that has often been emulated, but never T-£ j M) d m three-quarters of a century of develop- POS, For some reason not easily explicable other vjtt than as a sign of an amiable reaction, a cult Us recently developed in the interest of the over jar, known as "Leonore No. 2." of which the "No. |- if • revision.

But no one can have taken In the -jCo. 2 in all Its fulness without appreciating the tre .■enflons value of Beethoven's self-criticism. The jcesrpactaess, directness and Intensity of the re ■ulstd work make it a new creation.

That proclamation of hopeless pessimism would not have ibees so poignant as it was had it been taken at a Slower tempo, for it was a bad afternoon for the ■wind Instruments, and strong contrasts and sharp .aoce-tu&tions had to make good many defects ef tntc-r.s.'-. . .-. in that respect. Mr. Gerardy, who played Saint-Saens's concerto for violoncello, and played well, suffered from the same shortcoming, but in this instance it was not all the fault of the • bacd. Evidently the change in temperature from the tuning room to the hall set down the pitch of his instrument. The novelty in the scheme was a »>-mphor.lc pro rogue to "CEdipus, the King." by Max Schillings. Scope, purpose and style of the composition were indicated in a descriptive article which appeared in this ;ot:rr.aJ last Sunday. The hearing more than )mtl£.e£ the reading. Herr Schillings thinks broad ly, if not deeply, and his orchestra has a splendid capacity for heroic sons The antique note has been mere eloquently intoned, but It has seldom been striven for with greater zeal or earnestness. •The orchestration of the piece is at once sonorous and euphonious. In Its songfulness it recalls the' jretmg composer's "Ingwelde" prelude, which fig ured oa a programme of the Symphony Society •caie years ago. THE KUBELIK CONCERT. ~~ Alsioet as larg-e an audience assembled ln Car- Siegle Ha!! yesterday afternoon to hear Kubellk pla.y his -rtolln as -was there m Monday night, when fee made hie debut.

It was. necessary to use the : voice. The seeker of sensations, who has been re pressing- his emotions for several years.. has found a long desired idol in this young- Czech, and la go ing- to make hay while the sun shines. One would like also to record that this remark able violinist revealed qualities yesterday that his first programme nay not have allowed him to «how— a serious purpose, a genuine musical feeling ♦used or. thoughrfylness. self -examination and self- Juigment, aims and ideals Usher than mere sensu ous beauty of tone and the surprises which come from an unusual facility of execution. The oppor tunity, in a measure, was given. His programme ■was more digniaed and serious than that of Mon day night, and If It contained none of the highest tests cf musicianship, it allowed a wider scope of •motional and intellectual expression than the Psgadnl and Spohr concertos. But the young man Hi not stand the test successfully, and he remains after his second concert, as after his first, a striking illustration of those musical phenomena •which appear now and then to startle the world, ard once in a very lons time remain to be ex emplars of what is best and highest In the art. An enthusiastic and receptive public is ever ready to proclaim "Ecce. homo!" but hardly are the words «nt of Its mouth than the man has disappeared, and the chances are that he not even finds a. place la musical encyclopedias. Even critics against whose harsh strictures he and his managers have railed sometimes attain to that distinction. There have been exceptions to this, as to every rule, and should Kubellk add another to the list he need have no fear concerning encyclopedia fame. Historians will attend to that for him. He has •<m many of those elements which bring the "fleet tag immortality" of executant musicians. He Is teGOubtedly a genius in all that concerns the play . tog of his chosen instrument. No amount of con centrated effort can give a iron such a mastery ever a violin unless there is gleaming behind it the flame of genius. But to make this great gift •tranced, ryrniaetrical and satisfying, throng-h the work must shine a lofty mind, a soul which loves aot only the instrument, but the music for its own tike, and an ideal which alms to make the man tad his instrument only the expositor of the com- Poser'e thought. All this side of Kubellk seems f*t to be undeveloped, and though he may ravish tor ears with an almost unearthly beauty of tone, •• he <s:d yesterday, when he played the familiar Bach eir. and stir an audience to frenetic demon- Rratior.s by a wonderful display of staccati and fefe hand pixziiati, he still remains on the com iwrwively low plain of mere virtuosity. .

PART OF ABBEY'S SERIES TO BE SHOWN AT THE AMERICAN ART GALLERIES. The second series of Edwin A. Abbey's paint ings, presenting "The Quest of the Holy Grail." which were painted for the Boston Public Library, will be exhibited at the American Art Galleries, in East Twenty-third-st. , for two weeks, beginning to-morrow. These paintings, which have recently been ex hibited at the Guildhall In London, represent the latter adventures of Sir Galahad In his quest The entire series contains fifteen pictures. The first five are already placed in the Boston Library. In the first series of the pictures the earlier ex periences of the boy Galahad are shown — his de parture on the quest, his appearance at the Ar thurian Round Table, where he is knighted by King Arthur, the departure of all the knights who seek the Holy Grail, and finally his arrival at the Castle of Grail, where all the inmates are spiritu ally dead, and only with the coming of a blameless knight can they be freed. On this occasion an earthly taint still remains with Sir Galahad, and he fails. Only years after does he finally succeed. In the first of the pictures at this exhibition Sir Galahad is shown issuing forth from the Castle of Grail, the scene of his failure. As he rides out into the forest he meets the Loathly Damsel bear ing the body of a dead king. She Is under a curse, which compels her to wander about doing deeds of wickedness until the sinless knight shall free her. She and her companions curse Sir Galahad for his failure to free them. • • In No. 7 Sir Galahad is shown fighting with seven knights, the Knights of Darkness, the seven Deadly Sins, who have imprisoned a great company of maidens. the Virtues. Sir Galahad's mission is to overcome Sin and redeem the world by setting free the Virtues, and he fights the seven knights and conquers them. No. I shows Sir Galahad at the gate of the Castle of th*» Maidens, where he is met by a monk, who blesses him and delivers up to him the keys of the castle. In No. 9 Sir Galahad's entrance Into the castle is shown. He is met by the maidens, who have long been waiting the prophesied arrival of the per fect knight, who shall set them free. In No. 10 is shown Sir Galahad'? parting from Blanche-fleur, his bride, whom he leaves to resume his quest, thereby renouncing every earthly pleasure. in No. 11 Sir Galahad appears returning once more to the Castle at Grail. This time he suc ceeds in asking the question which frees the in habitants. The Grail is borne from the castle by an ■BgeL and Sir Galahad is directed toward the sea to Solomon's ship, which is destined to bear him to Sarras, when he is finally to see the Holy Grail. No. 12 shows him passing from the land, borne on a white charger, and followed by the blessings of the people he has rescued. No. 13 pictures Sir Galahad on Solomon's ship, bound for the city of Sarras. The Grail, borne by an angel, guides the ship. In No. 14 appears the city of Sarras. the goal of Sir Galahad's journey. In No. 15 Sir Galahad, now King of Sarras. sees the Holy Grail borne by Joseph of Arimathea and a company of angels. As Sir Galahad crazes upon the Grail his crown and sceptre fall from him. Having attained the object of his quest, he no longer needs these sym bols of earthly power. As he gazes at the Grail It is borne heavenward, and is never again seen on earth. SECRETARY GAGE NOT TO RESIGN ASSISTANT SECRETARY AIL.ES SATS HIS RE LATIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT ARE MOST CORDIAL. Milton E Ailes. Assistant Secretary of the Treas ury, last right at the Hoffman House denied abso lutely that there existed any trouble or strained relations between the President- and Secretary Gage. He said that the feeling oetween the twa men was as cordiai as ever. "I know for a fact, " said Mr. Alles. "that the relations between Secretary Gage and the TTesi dent are of the ple.isantest sort. They understand each other, and ea.cn appreciates the position of the other. The President regards Mr. Ga*e aa an able financier. How strong this belief is may read ily be seen by a reference to tae message. The President inserted the currency clause in that document, although, early in the administration, he had told friends that he doubted the wisdom of saying anything on that subject to the present Congress. "And now, reerardlng- the reports that the Secre tary is on the point of resigning. He has no in tention of quitting his post. He is tired answering the Inquiries on this subject, which reach him near ly every day.* "What I'll do to-morrow or a year from now.' he told me this morning. Til keep to myself.' These reports have been very annoying and troublesome. They have Interfered with the proper conduct of business." 

TEAT ISLAND FOR ANARCHISTS. DOES "THE WOMAN QUESTION" MAKE IT UNTENABLE? To the Editor of The Tribune. Sir: The proposal that the civilized nations of the world should transport anarchists who counsel the killing of rulers or the overthrow of governments to some desolate spot on the earth's surface desig nated for the purpose, where they would be free to put their creed In practice. Is not new. but it derives fresh Interest and some present importance from Senator Hoar's advocacy. In the course of the debate which Senator MeComas opened on Thursday Mr. Hoar submitted that plan as a solu tion of the problem. Baying: "Let the anarchists be an object lesson, and let the world have an ob ject lesson. Let there be a little Inoculation of an archy Into the anarchist himself, and let him have an anarchistic government among his fellows." If this Is the deliberate judgment of the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which, as your Washington correspondent points out, will have much to do with framing legislation on the subject, and if he is prepared to back it up with all his in fluence and authority, an exceeding!;" animated dis cussion is likely to ensue. Doubtless there is something rather gratifying to the natural feelings cf those who have been moved to righteous wrath by an overt act consistent with anarchistic doctrines in the thought of consigning all who profess such doctrines to a hell on earth of their own creation and belonging exclusively to themselves. But calm reflection suggests strong reasons why that remedy, even if the world should be Inclined to admit its efficacy, cannot be applied. Christian peoples are expending a vast amount of energy and money in systematic efforts to let light into dark places, to extirpate savagery by the re demption of savage natures and to spread the bless ings of civilization everywhere. Such work is not Invariably carried on with the highest wisdom. It is marked by many failure* and some disgraces, but the purpose behind it is sane, sincere and de liberate. It reflects the conscience and reason of a large proportion of the Intelligent populations by which the great governments of the world are sup ported, and the moral sense of Christendom would never tolerate a policy of dealing with anarchists which would amount to a repudiation of fixed prin ciples in respect to the duty of civilization toward barbarism. Practically, as it seems to me, this is an insuperable obstacle to such international legis lation as Senator Hoar proposes. If it were not so a kindred consideration would nevertheless interpose an absolute veto. Such a method of dealing with anarchists would be incom plete and inadequate if it did not provide for the de portation of women as well as men, for women have always been among the most rabid and dan gerous foee of social order, their sex giving them an influence which the whole history of anarchistic operations Illustrates. But even those who might consider it appropriate to deal with actual offenders of this sort In the way proposed would find it impos sible to justify the establishment of a breeding place for anarchists and the consequent subjection of innocent children to the hideous and hopeless conditions which would surround them there. If there were no other objection to the plan, this would be fatal. Civilized nations would never ac cept the dreadful responsibility of creating and maintaining an Institution which devoted successive generations to misery and perdition. Tours, New-York, Dec 6. 190 L L. H. [The considerations above presented are cer tainly hlsn minded, interesting and suggestive. But the reason finally given as "putting- an ab solute veto" upon Senator Hoar's proposal of an island for anarchists is not absolute at all or even very cogent. What is there to hinder using another island, remote from the first, as well as from the civilized worM, for the vromen anar chists?]

"WTLL A£K CONGRESS TO ERDCT A ME MORIAL IN WASHINGTON— PROPOSAL OF THE ARCH ASSOCIATION NOT ACCEPTED. "Washington. Dec. ".—The board of trustees of the McKinley National Memorial Association met hers to-day. Judffe "William R. Day, of Canton, presiding. Among those present were Cornelius N. Bliss, of New- York, Senator Har.na, of Ohio: Henry C. Payne, of Milwaukee; Myron T. Herrick. of Cleve land; Alexander H. Revell. of Chicago; General Henry M. Duffieid. of Detroit; George B. Cortelyou. John G. Milburn. of Buffalo; Senator Fairbanks, of Indiana; Henry J. Lowry. of Atlanta, and Henry T. Scott, of San Francisco. A deputation from the "William McKlnley Na tional Memorial Arch Association formally pro posed co-operation of the two associations In the collection of funds, and that of the total collected one-third go to the construction of a tomb In Can ton and two-thirds to the construction of an arch In "Washington. After a full discussion of the prop osition the McKiniey National Memorial Associa tion decided not to accept it, and adopted the fol lowing reso.iuion: Revived, That it is the sense of the trustees of the McKinley National Memorial Association that the field of popular subscription should be left to It for raising the sum necessary to provide a suita ble memorial to the late President at Canton where his body lies, and that this association should l join with the William McKiniey Memorm Arch Asso elation of Washington in memorializing Congress to erect a national memorial at the capital of our country to commemorate his services to the nation. It was Insisted by Judge Day. Senator Hanna and others that all popular subscriptions should be ap plied -•• the erection of a memorial at Canton, where the late President lived for n many years and is buried' and where Mrs. McKinley will eventually rest beside him. While it was hoped that Congress would take the matter In hand and erect in the national capital some fitting memorial to the mur dered President, the opinion was general that the people of the nation would prefer that their con tributions should be used to mark his tomb In Canton. The resolution -fill be presented to the Memorial Arch Association at a meeting to be held next Monday afternoon. Ryerson Ritchie, the secretary, reported that the xawrk of organization has so far advanced that within ten days the whole country will be covered by the State and local committees. From Hawaii Governor Dole, who is an honorary member of the board of trustees, writes that he expects a satis factory contribution, as the people of Hawaii thought a great deal of President McKinley. Gov ernor Hunt of Porto Rico is equally sanguine, and from Alaska the thousands who have gone to the gold fields assure the association of hearty co operation. New-England people already have re sponded generously. Governor Hill at Maine has appointed a State auxiliary, and the counties are being organized. Governor Crane of Massachusetts assures the trustees that the work will be pressed In his State, and similar assurances come from many other quarters. The movement has met with an almost Immediate response from the South. Gov ernor Aycock of North Carolina. Governor Davis of Arkansas, Governor Jennings of Florida and Gov ernor Heard of Louisiana have been especially In earnest. The Grand Army of the Republic and the schools have taken up the plan enthusiastically. In Minnesota Governor Van Saat baa given assur ances of

It is assuredly a hard market to guess, and it is well In dabbling in it to remember the old saw that "he who fights and runs away will live to fight another day," or. as Wall Street renders it. "be a. hero with your profits and a coward with your looses-" That is supposedly the view that John W. Gatea took of the market last spring. Mr. Gates paid the debt' contracted on the short side of Northern Pacific at the time of the corner, and. with the pertinent remark "that they had left him his watch and chain, set sail for foreign shores. There he proved that other .things were left to him besides his watch and chain. For a housa at Ascot, a marvellous automobile UK. • and an enormous loss at baccarat GATES at Aix les Bains kept him before ABROAD. the public eye. Incidentally ha purchased one of the finest indi vidual pearls ever shown In Paris for a scarfptn. The customs officials were awaiting Mr. Gates and Mi pearl at Quarantine, and what they compelled him to part with In order to retain that sea.. p. n went a long way toward relieving * e .?"i*l?S u 2: the taxpayers. Once free from the Custom House Mr. Gates was also free to observe the stock mar ket, and what he has seen there has filled him with amazement; perhaps with envy. ___. One reason for the peculiar course of the mar ket, and, indeed, the principal reason, has been the extraordinary gymnastic performance Amal gamated Copper It is reported .Mr. Gates, in commenting the other evening at the Waldorf or. the recent slump in copper, said: "Do you know, if I'd been responsible for the Amalgamated I verily believe I'd have been made to do time."

Sewell reached his horn* in this city in his private car this afternoon. Ha was in such a weakened state that It -was necessary for his two stalwart sons. Major Robert and Cap tain W. Joyce Sewell. and his faithful body ser vant. Ambrose, to carry him bodily from the car to his carriage. The same service had to be per formed when his . house was reached, and though there have been many callers at his home since his arrival, no one is permitted to see the patient. His sons say the general stood the journey well, and they hope that the comfort and quiet of his own home may restore some measure of his vital ity. He is seriously 111. however, and many of his friend? fear the worst. A consultation that lasted three hours was held this evening at the Sewell home between Dr. H. Genet Taylor, the family physician, and Drs. Tyson and Griffith. At its conclusion Dr. Taylor said there was no further statement to make concern- Ing the general's condition.
