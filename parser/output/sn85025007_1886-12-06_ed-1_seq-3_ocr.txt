Tho galleries ol' the Senate chamber were, in spite of t he iLcitmeuey of the weather, fiiled with spectators whoa, at twelve uoon, the second session ol* the forty-ninth Con gress was opened. The presiding officer, Mr. Sherman, laid before the Senate several of the annual re ports of the heads of departments, which were ordered printed, liesolntions were adopted, taxing the daily hour of meeting at noon ; informing tho House that the Senate was ready to proceed to business; and for the appointment of a committee to wait on the President for the like purpose. The credentials of Senator William?, of California, were presented, and tho oath of oflieo was administered to him. Several bills were introduced and referred. Tho message of I he President was receiv ed and read. 

JIOUSE. At precisely 1- o'clock Speaker Carlisle rapped the House to order. In obedience to the directioo of the Speaker the Clerk proceeded to call the roll, when 241 mem bers responded to their ni.mes. Resolutions wore adopted for the appoint ment of committees to inform the Senate aud the President that the House had or ganized and was ready 10 proceed to busi ness. Mr. Hevvitt, of New York, rising to a question of privilege, asked that Mr. S. S. Cos should bo sworn in as a member of the House to fill tho vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Joseph Pulitzer. Ke stated at the same time that the formal certilicate of Mr. Cox's election had not been received. No objection was tnad j to Mr. Cox's* quail Ty ing, and his personal popularity was mani fested by the round of applause which greeted his re-entry into legislative life. Messrs. Henry W. Rush, of Maryland, and Henry Bacon, of Now Voik, also appeared at the bar of the House aud qualified, filling the vacancies occasioned by the deaths of Wm. H. Colo and L'.'wis lieacb. At 12:10 a recess of .'10 minutes was taken. A further reci-ss was taken until two o'clock when '.he President's message was received aud read. '3'he B'prsiiScal'si )Io.?isjjgc. Washington, December G.?President Cleveland teat io Congress to day bis ?ec ond annual me?s?ge iu which be refers to the amicable relations existing witb foreign count rita and says fo.v questions have arisen during the past year, and none of tiioso &ro beyond the reach of Kciilemout- in friendly counsel. Ho referou to tIn; cruel treatment of inoffensive t.'h'ncse, and sujs much of this viokr.ee can l.e traced to race preju dice and competition of labor. Ke alludes to t ><?. sympathy between the people of the U.dUd .Slate-and France, which, he says, has received a fiv-h impulse in the dedica tion o( the status ef "1L;!vt:v Enlightening tho World" in New Yoik harbor. Cases, he says, ha v. > continued to ocaur in Germany in relation to tho privilege of so j mm of our naturalized citizens of Gsrcaau origin revisiting the land of their birth, yet our relations with that country have lost uono of the ir cordiality. In referring to the fishery questiou, he says that while he is desirou3 that friendly relations should con tinue to exist between us and tho inhabit ants of Canada, yet t ho acti >:i of their offic ials during the past so.ison towards our fish ermen bus been such as to seriiijly threat en their continuance. Tiio intimacy of our relations with Hawaii, ha thinic3, should be emphasized, and the importance if tele graphic communication bstwe-T:i thoso is laud-* and tho United States shou'd n >t be overlooked. lie recommends that a small vessel, no longer found adequate io our need;', should he presented to Liberia, to ba employed iu the protection of its coastwise revenues. He renews his former represent ation of the need of speedy legislation by Congress to carry into effect tho Reciproc ity Commercial Convention of Jauuiry 20, 1SSU, raid proposes to initiate wish Mex ico negotiations for a new and eelarg ed treaty of commerce aud navigation. He refers to the cafe of Cutting charged with the commission of a penal oflense in Texas, of which a Mexican citizen was the object. Alter demand had bc-en made f>r his release the charge against him was amended so as' to include a violation cf Mexican law within Mexican territory He says tho admission of such a pretension would bo attended with serious results, in vasive of the jurisdiction of this Govern ment, and highly dangerous to cur citizens in foreign lands; therefore he denied it, and protested against its attempted exercise, as unwarranted by the principles of law and international mages. Civil perturbations in the Satnoan Islands have during the past few years been a source of considerable em barrassment. Ia May last it was offered to place Samoa under the protection of the United States, and the ia'.e consul, without authority, granted it. The proceeding was promptly disavowed and theoverzjalous of ficial recalled. Witb a ha;minions under standing between the powers he think-* au tonomous administration of Samoa can hard ly fail to be secured. IIo renews the recom mendation oi his last annual message, that existing legislation concoruing citizenship and naturalization be] rev is ed. Experience, he says, suggests that our statutes regulating extradition might be amended by a provision for tho transit across our terri:orv, of fugi tives surrender!.d by a foreign government to a third state. He also recommends that provision ba made for the immediate dis charge from custody of persons committed for extradition whore the President is of opinion that surrender should not be made. He reiterates the necessity of supplying f-;ome mode of trustworthy inspection and report of the mauner iu which the consu lates are cm.hided. In tho absence of such reliable information, efficiency, by thinks, can scarcely be rewarded, or its opposite corroctcd. Iti referring to the income of ? tbo government ai.d the existence of a largo ! surplus in thy treasury, Ii? say?: uTho ap | plication of the surplus to tho payment of j such portion of the public t{.r:?t a? is now ; subject to ext ngui.-ibmen:, if ?*.?;:Ii.1 ti -d at j the rato which ha; Uu-Jy piwaiio.l, would retire that class of i tdehted-r --s whl;iu less than one year from this date. A continua tion of our present revenue sysiem would so^n result in the receipt of an annual in come much greater than necessary to meet Government expenses, with no indebted ness upon which it could bo applied. I recommend lint the unnocrsury surplus annually accumulating b.j release"] i?> the people by an nmeuwiacir to our revenue laws which shall cheapen tho price of tho necessaries of life and give freer entrance to such imported materials a-1, bv American labor, may be manufactured into marketa ble commodities." In conucction with this subjoct ho says: ''Wo iccegcize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of tho republic, and wo treat tb-?s3 who have it in their keeping as citizens entitled to the most careful regard and thoughtful attention, not only because iabor is the capital of our workiogmen, justly entitled to its share of Government favor, but fur the not less im portant reason that the laboring man, in his humble home, as a consumer is vitally inter rested in all that cheapens tho cost of living and enables him to bring within his domestic circle, additional comforts and advantages." Ho sees no reason to elm ago the views ex pressed in hi-; last annual message on tho subject of compulsory coiuage, and he again urges its suspension on all the grounds con tained in his former recommendation, rein forced by the significant increase of our gold exportation^ during the last year. Tho af fairs of tho postal service, ho says, show marked and gratifying improvement during tho past year, and suggests a sub?i dy to certain steamship linos carry ing tho mails, especially to South Ameri- ' can ports. He again urges a change iu the federal judicial system to uicoi; the wants of t;.e people and obviate the delays neces sarily attending (be present condition of af fairs in our c.>ui t-;. The recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior and the Comtui-: ioner of 'tho General Lmd Office looking in tho better protection of public lands and of tin* public surveys, iho preser vation of national forests, tho adjudication of grants to States and corporations and of private t.-nd rhtihis, :uu| the increased effi ciency of :ho public laud .service, he com mends to <<he r.! tent ion of Congres?'. He rccomroecdi the repeal of tho pro eruption and timber-culture acts, and that tho home stead laws be so amended as to better secure compliance with their requirements of res i dence, improvement, and cultivation for the period of dvo years from date of entry, without continuation or provision for spcc ulalive relit rpiielimenf. He also recom mends t:iu repeal of tho desert-land laws tin less it. sha'l !o tho pleasure of the Cor.gtcse to so auu-ud these laws as to render them lis? liable to abuses, lie fining to '.'4;! report. of she Secretary of the Nitvy < .ulaining n detailed exhibit cf tho coudi'.it'.i of h;* department, tho Presi dent says tho batteries of tho monitors am obsolete, and the vessels c.tn only bo relied upon as auxiliary ships in harbor defense, and then after such an expenditure upon them as might not be deemed justifiable. Of the wooden vessels he sayn it is estimated by the chief constructor of tho navy that only three v.ill be serviceable beyond a pe riod of six yutrs, at which time it may be said that (f ili;: present naval force notlnr g wirthy the M-nre wiil remain. As a plea for civil ssnkv he says: "Our civil -eivi e lefoim may i.v imperfect in some of its ('tails; it may be misuudcr s.ood and opposed : it may not ulwav3 be faithfully applied ; its deigns may somo times miscarry through mistake or willful intent; it may fcomctimis tremb'.o under the assaults of i;a enemies or languish under tho misguided z nl cf impractical friends; but if the people 1 f tfiis country ever submit to the b&ni^hmcut of its underlying princi ple from the operation of their government. they wiil abandon the surest guarantee cf the safety and success of American iustitu tious." The laws of tho District appear to be in an uncertain and unsatisfactory condi tion, and their codification or revision, ho thinks, is much needed. During the past year one of the bridges leading from tho District to the State of Virginia became unfit for use, and travel upon it was forbid den. This leads him to fuggest that tho improvement of all the bridges crossing tho Potomac and its branches, from the city of Washington, is worthy of tiro attention cf (Jong rets. S>3 2:2).
