The tuetion has been receding Mime considerable attention of late, mid particularly bv the boards of trade mid chambers: of commerce, it lias been ciiptomarv to favor Chinese exclusion, and few have even considered the influence on American commerce. The New York Cliainhcr of Comineice has been ex amining me Mimcso ijuesttoii tor n yearormoru and have summed up their opinions in the following letter: "It seems, that without uttering a word or lifting n tinker thu Chinese are enabled to retaliate n;;iiinst our commerce, so that ho hae not onlv offered them a nnnton ntlrout, but also injured oursehes in a twofold way by eeludins a tractable, and cheap labor, which wo erv much need to Imilil Uiourilesolatephu'Cs,iiuil by the loss of a Miluablo trade, whieli iniuht lmu kept to thu exclusion of 0111 rnals.

After reviewing the conditions of our commercial rein tarns and the great part played in the commercial world by the merchant, he turned his attention lo the crying need of thepreseut day ballot reform. He said: "Political selfishness cheapens in the minds of the people their apprehension of the character mid functions of the Ooxernment; it distorts every conception of thu duty of good citizenship mid creates an atuiospheiu in which iniquitous purposes and design lou their odious features. It begins when a perverted judgment is won to the theory that political action may bu used solely for private gain and advantage, and when a tender conscience is quieted by the ingenious argument that such cain and advantage are identical with thu public welfare. This stage having been reached and self-interest being now fully aroused, agencies nro used and prac tices permitted in the accomplishment 01 its purposes, wincli seen in tlio pure light ot disinterested patriotism, nre viewed with fear and hatred.
