THE 

REBELLION AND FOREIGN INTERFERENCE. . kncu. r A .'disloyal portion ofi thoi Amoricnn psoplo lmvo, during tho wholo year, been cngagod in au attempt to divido and des troy tho Union. A nation which endures factiotjs, dquicstic, divisions' is, Exposed to disrespect' abroad, and 0110 party, or both. . . . J. . . 1 is suro, sooner or later, to invoko foreigti intervention. Nations thus tempted to intorfero aro not always ablo to resist tho counsels of scorning expediency nnd tin genorous ambition, although measures Adnntnd linilnt cnnli inll.t..nnnj rn!l to bo tinfortunato nnd injurious to those! nrinnriixr (l,..m 1 to Tho disloyal citizens of tho United1 States who lmvo offered tho ruin of our country in reword for tho aid and com fort which thoy havo invoked abroad, have received loss patronngo nnd encour agement than thoy probably expected. If it wcro just to suppopo, ns tho insurg ents lmvo seemed to assume, that foreign nations in this caso, disregarding all nior nl, social and treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for tho most hpecdy-restoration of commerce,' includ ing specially, tho acquisition of cotton, theso nations appear os yet not to havo seen their way to thoir object more direct ly or clearly through tho destruction than through tho preservation of tho Union. If wo. could dnro to beliovo that foreign Motions are actuated by no higher prinei-" plo than this lam quito sure a second ar gument could bo mado to show that thay could roach their oiin more readily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giv ing encouragement to tho principle lover relied on by it. Tho exciting of foreign nations, to hostility against us, as already intimated, is the otnbarrassmoiU of com merce. These notions, however, not im probably saw from tho first that it was tho Union which mado as well our for eign as our domostio commerce. Thoy can scarcely fail to porccivo that tho ef fort for disunion produces tho existing difficulty, nnd that 0110 strong nation promises more durable peace, and n more extensivo, vnluablo and reliable commorco than tho snmo nation broken into hostile fragments. It is. not my purpose to re view our discussions with foreign States, heeauso whatever might ba their wishes, or dispositions, tho integrity of our coun try nnd tho stability ol our Government mainly depciuu not upon them, but up on tho loyalty, patriotism, viituo and in tolligenco of the American people. Tho correspondence itt-clf, with the iibual res cr vat ion, is herewith submitted. I ven turo to hopo that it will appear that wo havo practiced prudenco nnd liberality towards lorciKn powers nvcrtins' causes of irritation, and with firmness maintain ing our own rights nnd honor. Since, however, it is apparent here, ns in every othor State, loroign dangers necessarily attend domestic dfficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures bo ndoptcd for maintaining tho public de fences on ovory sido ; while under this general recommendation provision for defending our coast lino readily oecufTto tlio mind. OUR DEFENCES. I also, in the samo connection, nsk tho attention of Congrcsi to our great lakes nnd rivers.,. It is believed that somo for tifications nnd depots of arms and muni tions, with harbor and navigation im provements, at well selected points upon theso, would bo of groat importance to tho national dofonco and preservation, I nsk attention to tho views of tho Sec retary of War, expressed in his report on tho samo coneral subject. 1 deem it of importance that tho loyal regions of East Tounossco nnd Wcstorn Noith Carolina should bo connected with Kentucky nnd othor faithful parts of the Union by rail road. I therefore recommend ns a mili tary measure, that Congress provide for tho construction of such a road as speed ily as possible Kentucky will no doubt co-operato, and through hor Legislature mako tho most judicious solcction of tho line.. Tho northern terminus must con nect with somo existing railroad, and whether tho routo 6ball be fronr Lexing ton or Nicholasvillo to Cumberland Gap, or fromLobanon to tho Tennossco liny, in tho direction of Knoxvillo, or somo still different lino, can easily bo determined. Kentucky nnd tho Qonornl Government co-oporating, the woru can uo compieioci in n vcrv short time, nnd when done will not only bo of vast present usefulness, but also an availablo pormanent improvement vorth its cost 111 nil tho lutnre 

FOREIGN TREATIES. Somo treaties dosigned chiclly for tho intfirosts of commerco, and Having no cravo political importance, havo been ne- L'otiatcd, nnd will bo submitted to tho for hoir consideration. Although wo havo failed to induco somo of tho coin- mercial powers to adopt a desirable moli-r, the rigor , maritime war. wo Havo lai romovou im ii.' num I .. . 1 I1 ... n...fn,i.,i., fi.,.1-. tho way of their humnno reform, except Biich as aro of merely temporary and ac cidental occurrence. 1 invito your atten tion to tho corrospondonco between her Britanio Majesty's Minister, accredited this Government, and tho Secretary State, relativo to the detontion of tho British ship Perthshire, in Juno last, tho United States steamer Mossachusctts, for a supposed breach of tho bloekado'. As this detention was occasioned by obvious misrepresentation of tho facts, nnd ns justice requires that wo should commit no bolligorent act not founded strict right os sanctioned by publio law, T rnnnni mn till Hint nn annropriation mado to satisfy tho reasonable demand tho ownors of tho vossol for her detontion. THE CHINA CLAIMS. I repeat tho recommendation of 1 1 picpecessor, in ins annual mcssago to in December last, m regard to tho disposition of tho surplus which I 'r"1', or muisiymg citizens Bttninst Olii-1 no, pursuant to' tlio"awards of tho Corn hiissioiiors, under llio act of.fhq !)d uf, March, 1850. If, however, it should not' bo deemed ndvisibld to carry that iccom- mendntion into effect, I would sngtrost' that authority bo given for bo given for investing tho the surplus referred to, in , with a view to tho satis- principle, over good securities faction of snch other iustcl'niins of our citizens ogainst China os'nre not unlike ly to oriso hoicaftcr in tho'courso of our oxtonsivo trado with that Umpire. 15y tho act of tho 13th of .March last, Congress authorized tho President to in struct tho comtiinfidors of suitable vessels 10 dof!rml tllcn'iolvs against, and to cop Mtl-n htrnlno Tina nlill.nrlli. 1lnn 1.Ann n turo pirates. This authority has boon ox- erciscd in a single instanco only. For tho ruoro efl'cctual protaction of our oxtensivo nnd valuable ooinmerco in tho Eabtern sens, especially, it seems to 1110 that it would bo advi'sablo to oiithor- ho tho con'"'!nil?rf' of sailing vessels' to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels, or their cargos, and tho Consular Courts estab lished by law in Eastern countries to ad judicate tho cases in tho event that this should not bo objected to by tho local au thorities.

INDEPENDENCE OF HAYTI AND LIBERIA. If any good reason exists why wo should porsovcrc longer in withholding our recognition of' tho independence and sovereignty of Ilaj'ti and Liberia, I am unnblo to discern it. Unwilling, how ever, to inaugurate a novel policy in re gard to t' cm without the approbation of Longress, I submit tor yonr consideration tho expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a Ohargo d' Affaires near each of thebo Slates. It does not admit of doubt that important commercial ad vantages might bo secured by favorable treaties with them. THE TREASURY. Tho operations of tho Treasury during tho period which has elapsed sinco yom adjournment, havo been conducted with signal success. Tho patriotism of tho people has placed at the disposal of tho Government tho largo menus demanded by the public oxegencies. Much of tho National Loan has been taken by citi zens ol tho industrial classes, whoso con fidence 111 their country's faith nnd zeal for their country s dehvernuco from its present peril, havo induced them to con tribute to tho Government tho wholo of their limited acquisitions. This fnct im poses peculiar obligation to economy in disbursement nnd oneigy in action. The rovenuo from all sources, includ ing loans for tho financial year ending on the 30th of June, 1801, was $80,835,- 900 27, nnd tho expenditures for tho same period, including payments on ncconnt of the public debt, were 

SS1,57S,0:U 34; leaving n balanco in the Treasury on the 1st of July, of $l2,i57,00r) 80 for tho first quaiter of tho financial year cndiiij the 30th of So t., 1SG1. The receipts from all sources, includ ing tho balance from July 1st, were $102, 532,500 27, nnd the expenses, 898,239, iiiii III); leaving a balanco on tlio 1st ol October, 1801, of 4,202,770 IS. Esti mates for the remaining tlneo quarters of tho year and for the financial year of 18G3, together ith his viows of the ways and means of meeting the demands contem plated by them, will bo submitted to Con gress by the Secretary of tho Treasury. It is giatifying to know that the ex penses mado necessary by tho rebellion aro not boyond the resources of tho loyal people, and to believe that the same pat riotism which. lias thus far sustained tho Government will continiio to sustain it until pcaco and union shall again bless tho land. THE ARMY. ono copy ..! which propei.y aim c s SSPor J ed to each oHho persons d th, di s of an I respectfully refer to tho report of tho Secretary of War for infoi motion re specting tho numerical strength of tho army, nnd for recommendations having in viow an iucreaso of its efficiency, nnd tho woll-boing of tho various branches of tho service entrusted to his "caso. It is gratifying to know that tho patriotism of tho peoplo is equal so tho occasion, nnd that the number of troops greatly exceed tho forco which Congress authorized 1110 to call into tho field. 1 refer with pleas nro to thoso portions of his report which mako allusion to tho croditablo degrco of discipline already attained by our troops, nnd to the excollont sanitary condition of tho entire army. Tho recommondntion of tho Secretary for an organization of tho militia upon a uniform basis, is a subject of vital im portance to tho future safety of tho coun try, and is commended to tho serious at tention of Congress. A largo addition to the regular army, in connection with tho defection that has so considerably dimiuMied tho nuiiibor of its officers, gives peculiar importnnco to his recommendation for increasing the corp3 of cadets to tho greatest capacity of tho Military Academy.

JUDICIARY. There nro thrco vacancies on U10 bench of tho Su prcmo Court. Two by the de ccaso of Justices Daniels nnd McLean, nnd 0110 by tho resignation of Justieo Campbell. I have so far forborno mak ing any nominations to fill theso vacan cies for reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing Judges resided with in tlio btnto now overrun by revolt, so that if successors wcro appointed in tlu snmo localities thoy would not bervo up on their circuits, and many of tho most competent men there ptobably would not take tho porsonal hazard of accepting to servo oven here upon tho supremo bench. 1 novo been unwilling tO'tlirow all tho appointments noi;thwaid, thus disabling myself from doing Justice to tho South on tho reluin cf pence, althpugh I may remark that to transfer to' ho North, pno which has heretofore boon in tho South, would not, with reference to territoiy nnd population, bo unjust. During tho long nnd brilliant judicial career of Judgo Mc Lean, his circuit grew into an empire nl together too largo for any 0110 JudgQ to givo the couits therein more than a nom inal attendance, rising in population from 1.470,000 in 1831, to 0,151,405 in 1800. Besides this tho country has generally outgrown our present Judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended, tho system requires that nil tho States shall bo accommodated with Circuit Courts, attended by Supremo Judges, whilo in fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kan sas, Floiida, Texas, California, and Or egon, havo never had nny such com ts, nor can this bo well remedied without a chnngo of the system, becauso tho adding of Justices to tho Supremo Court, enough for tho accommodation of all parts of tho country with Circuit Courts, would crento a court altogether too dangerous for a judicial body of any sort, and the ovil of it be ono that will iucreaso 'ns new States como into tho Union. Cir cuit Couits nro useful or thoy aro not use ful. If useful, no Stato should bo denied them. lf"not useful, no State should have them. Let them bo provided for all, or abolished as to all. Tlneo nullifications occur to mo hero, which I think would bo an improvement upon our present system. Let the Su premo Couit bo of convenient number in ovcry event. Then first let the who'o country bo divided into ciicuits of conve nient size, tho Supremo Judges to servo in a number of them corresponding to their own number, nnd independent Cir cuit Judges bo provided for nil tho rest ; or secondly, the onpiemo Judges no re lieved from Circuit duties, nnd Circuit Judges provided for all tho Circuits ; or thirdly dispense with Circuit Courts al together, leaving the Judicial functions wholly to tho District Couits, and nn in dependent Suproino Court. THE U. S. 

STATUTES. : I respectfully recommend to tho con sideration of Congress, tho present con dition of tho statue laws, with tho hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for tho many inconvoniences and evils which constantly embarrass thoso enggaged in tho practical adminis tration of them. Sinco tho organization of tho Govern ment Congress has enacted somo 5000 acts and joint resolutions which fill more than G000 closely printed pages, and nro scattered through many volumes. Many of theso nets have been drawn in hasto and without suflicint caution, so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful ns to render it very difficult fur oven tho best informed persons to ncccrtoin precisely what tho stotuto in law is. It seems to mo vcrv impoitnnt that tho statuto law should bo mado ns plain nnd intelligiblo-ns possible, and bo re duced to ns small n compass and may consist with tho fullues and and provi sion of tho legislature and tho perspicu ity of its langungo. Theso well done would, 1 think, greatly facilitate tho la bors of thoso whoso duty it is to assist in tho administration of the laws, and would bo n lasting benefit to tho people by placing before them in a more access ible and intelligible l'oim the law which so deeply concern their interests and their duties. I am informed by somo owhos opin ion x respect, that nil tho octs of Con gress now in forco nnd of a permnnont, general naturo, might bo revised ond re written so ns to bo embraced in ono vol ume, or at least two volumes of ordina ry nnd convenient size; nnd 1 respectful ly recommend to Congress to consider tho subject, nnd if my suggestion bo ap proved, to deviso such a plan as to their wisdom shall seem mosc proper for tho attainment of tho proposed. 

NORTHERN CLAIMS IN REBEL STATES. of Ono of tho unfavorable consqeuonccs of tho presont insurrection is tho entire suppression in many places of oil ordin ary menus of administering civil justieo by tho officers, nnd in tho forms of existing law, This is tho caso in wdiolo oiin part in all tho insurgent States, and as our armies advanco upon and toko possession of parts of thoso States, the practical ovil becomes more apparent. There nao no couits or olhcers to wliom tho citizens of othor Stntos may apply for tho enforcement of their lawful claims against citizousof tho insurgont States, and thoro is a vast amount of debt con btituting such claims. Somo havo cs- timntod it os high as 200,000,000 dol Congress, lars, duo in laigo wait from insurgents open lobollion to loyal citizens, who , aio oven now making gieat sacrifices J j 1 .... . , . ..... tho discharge of their pntno io duty to slinnnrt thn irnvnniment. Ilmlnr (tin . 7 , . I!.!... I ... ....II! I 1.. ..'I'. . iicucu to cstnuiiHii, uy muitury power courts to ailniitiister summary justice in such cas.es. I havo thus far declined In do it, not becnuso 1 had any doubt that tho end proposed, tho collection of debt iw just and right in -itself but bccntio 1 wa inst and rL-ht in -itnlf but hn I l.avobeen unwilling to Co bevoml the u t-J j "i pressure of necessity 111 the uttial cxer- ciso of power. Hut tlio powers of Con- gross, 1 supposo, and therefore, I refer mo wnoie matter 10 uongrcs, witu tnc that a pian may bo devised for the adminislrotiou ofjnsticu in nil such ports of tho insurgent Stntos and territories as, may bo under control of this Govern ment. Whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by tho powor of onr arms. This, however, is not to be a permanent institution, but n tempo rary substitute, and to censo as soon as tho ordinary courts can bo ro-cstablished in peace. CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. It is important that some more con venient menus should be provided if pos sible for tho ndjustment of claims ngainst tho Government, especially in View of their increased number by reason of the war.. It is as much tlio duty of tho Government to render prompt justice n gainst itself in favor of citizens ns it is to administer tho snmo between private individuals. ' Tho investigation nnd nd justation of all tho claims in their nature belong to tho Judicial department? be sides it is apparent that tho attention of Congress will bo moro than usually engaged forsomo timo to cdmo with great national questions. It was intended by the organization of tho, Court of Claims mainly to roinovo this branch of businoss from the halls of Congress; but while tho .Com t has proved to bo an cfTcctivp nnd valublo means of investigation, it in a great degrco fails to efiect tho object of its creation for want of powor to mnko its judgment final. Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say tho danger, of the subject, 1 commend to yonr careful con sideration whether this power of making judgments final may not be properly given to tho Court, reserving tho right of appeal on question of law to tho (su premo Court, with such other provisions as experience may have shown to be nec essary. THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT. Postmaster General, tho following being a summary statement oi tuo condition 01 tho Department, lhe rovenuo lrom all sonrces during tho fiscal year ending 30. Juno, 1801, including tho annual perma nent nppropiiation of $700,000 for the transportation of frco mail matter was 9,049,290.40, being about two percent less than the revenuo of ISfiO. Tho ex penditures were $13,G0G,709.11, show ing a decrease 01 more man o per cent, ns compared with those of tlio previous year, and leaving an excess of expendi turea over tho revnuo for tho lat fiscal year over 8557,402 71. The gross rev enue for tho year ending Juno 30th, 1SG3, is estimated nt nn increase of four per cent, on thnt of 1SG1, making 89,382, 000. The total expenditures for 1803 nro estimated deficiency nt812,528,000, leaving an estimated deficiency of $3, 331,000 to bo supplied from tho Treas ury, in addition to the,, permanent appropriation. THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. Tho present insurrection shows, I think, that tho extention of this district across the Potomac river at tho timo of establishing tho eapitol hero, was emi nently wiso, and consequently, that tho relinquishment of that portion of it which lies in tho Stato of Virginia, was unwiso nn 1 dangerous. I submit for your con sideration expediency of regaining thnt paitof tho dwtiict and tho restoration of tho oiiginal boundaries thereof through negotiation with tho Stato of THE 

INTERIOR. Tho report of tho Secretary of terior, with the accompanying docu ments, exhibit the condition of the sev eral branches of the public business pertaining to that Dcpaitmcnt. Tho depressing inllueneo of tho insurrection have been especially felt in tho operation of tho Patent and General Land Office. Tho cosh receipts from the snles of pub lio lands during the past year havo ex ceeded tho expenses of onr land system only about two thousand dollars. The sales have been entirely suspended in tho Southern States, while the interrup tions to the business of the country, nnd tho diversion of largo numbers of men from labor to military servico havo ob btiucted settlements in tho now States ond Territoiies of tho Northwest. The roeoiptsof tho Patent Ofiieo havo declined in nino months, about 100,000 dollars, Kudoring a largo reduction of tho force employed necessary to mako it self sustaining. Tho domain! upon the Pension Offico will bo largely increased by the insurrection Numerous applica tions for pensions based upon the caus alities of tho existing war, lmvo all ready been mado. There is reason to believe that many who aro upon the Pension ltoll nnd in receipt of tlio bounty of tho Government nro in tho ranks of the in suigont army or giving thoin aid nnd comfort. Tho Secretary of tho Intciior has directed tho suspension of tho pay ment of tho pension of such persons, up on proof of thoir disloyalty. I rocom mond that Congress authorize that officer to causo tho names of such persons to be stiickon from tho pension Itolls. INDIAN AFFAIRS. - rrlin rnlnttnn n film Government with dm Indian tribes havo been lately distur nn bed by tho insurrection, especially in t the t of of Kansas is in posession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas.

AGRICULTURE. THE SLAVE TRADE. The execution of the laws for the sup pression of tho African slave trade, has been confined to the Department of the interior. It is a subject of congratula tion that the efforts which have been mado for tho suppression of this inhuman traffic havu recently been attended with unusunl success. I' ive vessels being fitted out for tho slave trado have been seized and con demned ; two masters engaged in the trade, and ono person equipping tlio ves sel ns a blnvcr, has been convicted nnd subjected to tho penalty of fine and im prisonment, and ono captain taking up a cargo of Africans on board his vessel has been convicted of the highest grade of of- lenco under our law, tlio punishment of which is death. THE TERRITORIES. Tho Territories of Colorado, Dakotah, and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been organized, nnd civil adminis tration has been inaugurated therein un der auspices tho most gratifying, when it is considered that tho leaven of treason was found existing in somo of these new countries when the Federal officers arrived there. Tho abundant natural resources of theso Territoiies, with the security and protection anorded by organized Govern' ment, will doubtless invite to them 1 largo immigration when peace shall re store tho business ot the country to its accustomed channels. I submit tho res olutions of the Legislature of Colorado, which evinced the patriotic spirit of the people of tho territory, bo far the au thority of tho United States has been up- lield in all the territories, ns it is hoped it will be in tlio future. 1 commend their interests and defence to tlio enlightened nnd care of THE DISTRICT. I reeomend to tho favorable considera tion of Congress tho interests of the Dis trict of Columbia. The insurrection has been tho causo of much suffering and sac rifice to tlio inhabitants, and as thoy havo no representative 111 Congress, that body should not ovorlook their just claims up on the trovernment. THE WORLD'S FAIR. At your Into session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing th President to take measures for facilitating a proper representation, of the industiial interests of tho United States nt tho exhibition of tho industry of all nations, to bo holdeu at London in tho year 1802. I regret to havo been unnblo to givo personal atten tion to this subject, a subject at onco so interesting in itself, nnd so extensively and intricately connected with the mnto terial prosperity of tho world. Through tho Secrotaiies of tho Stato and intciior a plan or system has been devised and par tially matured, which will bo laid before you. THE
