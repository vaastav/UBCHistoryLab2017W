President Mc Kinley today sent his annual message to congress. He congratulates It upon assembling under felicitous conditions. Peace anu good will with all nations of tne eaiia continue unbroken, he says, and'vve should feel genuine satisfaction at the growing spirit of fraternal re gard and unification in all sections of our country and the lifting of great public questions above party prejudice. Beginning with the subject of the fln anances, the president says that wh.ls the full effect of the legislat.cn . I ...c.- tra session has not been reani. .u It has already accomplished u. ..s s of its timeliness and wisdom, ..6t its permanent value further time v. i.i be required, and the people, Eat.sfied With its operation and results thus lar, are in no mind to withhold from it a fair trial. The next question pressing for consid eration is that of the currenc y. With the great resources of the government and with the honorable example of the past before us, we would not hesitate to en ter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obligations less oner ous to the government and relieve cur financial laws from ambiguity and doubt. The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the govern ment of maintaining at parity with gold our different forms of money, and the experiences the past four years have demonstrated that this is net only an expensive charge upon the government but a dangerous menace to our national credit. It is manifest that we must de Vise some plan to protect the government against bond issues for repeated re demption. We have nine hundied mill ions of currency which the government, by solemn enactment, has undertaken to keep at par, and nobody Is obliged to redeem In gold but the government, which must borrow the gold. The law which requires the payment out of the treasury of redeemed United States notes demands a constant replenishment of the gold reserve, especially in times of panic and insufficient revenue, and dur ing the preceding administration $262, 815,400 4 per cent bonds were issued and sold to sustain the gold reserve and pay the expenses of the government in excess of revenue. While it is true that a greater part of this was used to supply deficient revenues, a considerable por tion was required to maintain the gold reserve. If no further legislation is to be had to correct this and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, then congress should give the secretary of the treasury authority to sell bonds at long or short periods bearing a less rate of interest than is now authorized by law. The president says: "I earnestly recommend as booh as the receipts of the government are quite, sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government that when any United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gcd, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. Tn.s is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the government, he should not receive from the government a United States note without paying gold in exchange for It." Turning to loreign aftairs.the president devotes much space in his message to a considerat.on of the Cuban question, which, he . ays, is the most important problem with which oiur government is now called upon to deal in its foreign relations. Summarizing the histoiy of former outbreaks, the president comes down to the piesent insurrect.on, speak ing of its remarkable increase, its tena cious existence against enormous forces massed by Spain, the widespread de struction of property and tne u.Mtgard of the civilized code of war on both sid-es. He says this condition gives li&e to the gravest apprehension. There is no de sire on our part to profit by Spain's mis fortunes, and we have only the desire to see the Cubans enjoying that measure of self control which is the inalienable right of all. Of the concentration policy of Weyler, he says: "It has utterly failed as a war measure. It is not civiliztd wai fare, it Is extermination." Against tn.s abuse of the rights of war, the presiuent says he has felt constrained on repeated oc casions to enter thw firm and earnest pro test of this government. He outlines his instructions to Minister Woodford, which were in substance to impress upon the Spanish government the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war by reaching a peaceful and lasting result just and hon orable to Spain and the Cuban people. It was also asked whether Spain of her own volition should not make proposals for settlement, and it was said that he could not con template an indefinite period for the accomplishment of this result. The Spanish reply to Mr. Woodford was, In the president's opinion, In the direction of a better understanding. It admitted our friendly purposes and deep interest, and declared that the new government was bound to a change of policy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end political reforms will be put into effect and military operations conducted on humane lines. Taking up the question of belligerency, the president quotes at length from Pres ident Grant's message of Dec. 7, 1875, wherein he declared that the conditions in Cuba warranted neither the recogni tion of Independence nor the recognition of belligerency. He adds that, more over, a recognition of belligerency would confer upon neither party to the conflict a sfStus not heretofore not actually pos sessed, whle It would weigh heavily In Spain's behalf, giving her right of search on the high seas and extending her mari time rights to the margin of our terri torial waters. "For these reasons," says the president. "I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurg ents as now unwise and therefore Inad missible." He says the near future will demon strata whether a righteous peace Is likely to be attained; if not. the exigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be taken. Sure of the right, the government will continue its watchful care over American citizens and its efforts to bring about honorable peace, and, says the president, "If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty im posed by our obligations to ourselves to civilization and humanity to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part, and only because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the' support and approval ol the civilized world." The president next takes up the sub ject of the annexation of Hawaii, which, he says, should be accomplished. Rap idly reviewing his former arguments in favor of annexation, he says that legis lation is required In the event of the rat ification of the treaty; and, while abrupt assimilations of immature elements of population should be avo'ded, Just pro vision should be made for self-rule In local matters with the largest political liberty to the Hawalians. International arbitration Is declared by the president to represent the best sentiment of the civilized world, and treaties embodying these humane prin ciples on broad lines without in any way imperilling our Interests or honor will have his constant encouragement. Attention is also called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and to the extension of civil authority within the territory. There is need for surveys and for the establlsahment of another land office at some point in the Yukon valley, fcr which an appropriation Is asked. Military force is also necessary and the establishment of some sort of flexible government, If the startling reports as to the probable shortage of food for the miners be fully verified every effort should be made at any cost to carry them relief. The Nicarague canal is spoken of as of large importance to our country and the promise is made of a further reference tto the subject when the report of the commission now at work is sent to con gress. The president says of the International monetary commission that, notwith standing diligent effort, the envoys have failed so far to secure an agreement. Gratification is expressed at the action of France in this matter In joining In our ' efforts, and it is said that the negotia tions are still pending. Meanwhle, the envoys have not made their final report, believing that the doubts raised in cer- ! tain quarters respecting the feasibility of maintaining parity between gold and sliver may yet be solved. The president earnestly hopes that their labors may ; bring about an International agreement. 1 The president devotes the last chapter . of his mesage to the civil service, the 1 practical improvement of which, he says, has long been a subject of earnest dis cussion, and which has of late years ' received increased legislative and exec utive approval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon a still firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. While the right of deserving veteran soldiers to reinstate- ! ment has been asserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have been care fully guarded against;" the examina tions improved and made practical, and a distinct advance has been made by giv ing a hearing before dismissal upon all cases where incompetency Is charged or demand made for the removal of officials. Mmllolpal Klectinn-. Boston, Dec. 8. Seventeen of the 32 cities of the commonwealth held their municipal elections yesterday. In a majority of the cases the Republicans were successful In electing their mayor and securing control of the city govern ment, although the results show that the Idea of Independent or non-partisan con trol of municipal affairs is steadily growing in favor. In Havarhill the success of Daniel F. Chare, the non-partisan Democrat and Socialist candidate, is said to sig nify that partisan nominations are at an end in that city. In Marlboro the city elected a Dem ocratic mayor for the first time in its history, a result attributed to the great personal popularity of the candidate. Newton voted under a new s rgle charter with cnly one mayoralty candi date. The closest fought elections were those In Lawrence, Maiden, SpringnVd, Somerville and Waltham, all on purely local Issues, in the first named the Dem ocratic candidate having declared his intentiOTi, If elected, to shake up the office holders of that city. Seven of the mayors chosen won upon other than straight party nominations, although nearly all had party endorse ment. Six maycrs were re-elected. On the license ccrtest the contest, as usual, was closely fought, but the ad vocates of no-license last much ground and strength. M'lint nn Kxnminer Fnnnri. Waverly, N. T., Dec. 7. C. T. Hull, for many years cashier of the First National bank of Athens, N. Y., was arrested yes terday, charged with embezzlement and making false entries In the books of the bank. He pleaded not guilty and gave bail in $2000 for his appearance Dec. 28 for examination. Hull left the bank's employ about two years ago, and a couple of months ago the bank went into voluntary liquidation. A United States examiner went through the books, and, It Is alleged, found a shortage of $1373. Hull was prominent in Grand Army and musical circles, and Is widely known. Treur Not Coiuitvi-fritrd.

LYNESS ESCAPES The Hospital and a Fearful Hospitals in greatcities are sad places to visit. Three fourths of the patients lying on those snow-white beds are women and girls. Why should this be the case ? Because they have neglected themselves! Women as a rule attach too little importance to first symp toms of a certain kind. If they have toothache, they will try to save the tooth, though many leave even this too late. They comfort themselves with the thought that they can replace their teeth ; but they cannot replace their internal organs 1 Every one of those patients in the hospital beds had plenty of warnings in the form of bearing-down feelings, pain at the right or the left of the womb, nervous dyspepsia, pain in the small of the back the " blues," or some other unnatural symptom, but they dii not heed them. Don't drag along at home or in the shop until you are finally obliged to go to the hospital and submit to horrible examinations and . operations t Build up the female organs. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will bave you from the hospital. It will put new life into you. The following- letter shows how Mrs. Lyness escaped the hospital and a "I done for then 27 VO vf ter one week I began to recover and steadily improved until I was cured completely. By talcing the I'inkham medicine, I avoided an operation which the doctor said I would certainly have to undergo. I am gaining every day and will cheerfully tell anyone what you have done for me."
