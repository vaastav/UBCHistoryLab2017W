fthf §emnrratu IMUwafc. Hmr tandbbfork.i WM, H. VA-VDERFORD, / •'*•• WESTMINSTER, MB. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1871. , P tW NMWOBHk. A few Week* ago we apoke of the probabilities of lb* fomatioa of a j-afiinuul Reform Part; combining all the element* of opposition to the present Administration Rot s change in the polities! Itnleideseepe presents to public •vie* a very different aspect at the present time. The "New Departure” is dead, "Pnssttiam” is desd, snd the •oslj "Reform Party” likely to do battle in the political arena i* the Democratic 'Conservative party, which itnowaeema will preaant a bold and united front to the enemy, and will be alreogthened by liberal accession* from tho rank* of men of moderate political viewa, who are adverse to tho excesses of tho Qrant Adminiatratioo and ita centralising ten dencies. In support of this view of the present politics) sspect, we might cite the opinions of many leading coo temporaries, but the following, which is a fair representative of the whole, will suffice, at tba present time : Says the Lagrange (Ga.) Reporter, No vember 24.—And now cornea the propoai lion, following in the wake of the "new departure.” to the effect that the Demo cratic psrtjr shall go over, "horse, fool, snd dragoons,’’ to s few disaffected Republi cans, sad nominate one of their number for President. To accomplish this Utter fom, it is pro i posed that comssicid of principle shall be I made to meet the disaffected Republicans oa half way grated, and make no further oppoation to what they consider “dead issues, and thus unite all opposition to Grant's roolectkut. Now, when the Dem ocratk party determines to compromise principle for the sc ke of the public plunder, it is no longer Democratic; when it con donee with the usnrpative, not to say crim inal legudalion of the Republican party, its missiQii, as the party of republican government, is ended; when it ceases to be f< >r the preservation of popular liberty, it becomes a disintegrated mass of political elements incapable of pub hegood. Toe true policy of the Democratic party is to remain solid and firm to principle. I>we is a great contest to be fought between civil liberty upon tho one hand,and central ism upon the other. The fi-ht is to be an intellectual one, requiring brains, states manship, and firmness and integrity, to win it in favor of the liberties of the people. We need giant minds and Roman firmneaa for our lea (era as we go to the front to meet the enemies of free and equal govern incut. We need leaders capable of rising above all selfish or personal motives—men whose sole aim is to preserve and perpeu uale the Government ofoor fathers. This is no tune for truckling subserviency to any wdiey ol expediency. Our liberties arc threatened by the bydra-headed monster of Centralism, and there is no party that pre sebts to the country the elements of sound republican government save a pure and un defiled Democracy. We may organic a new party, but no such organization can be effected except by a compromise of principle. Any new party can only be formed by an advance step towards centralism; and the only object in view by those who with new party combi nations is, that the papular sentiment may be decoyed in that direction. Let the Democracy be wary and watchful, for we have traitors in oar ranks who would sell ths country for mere temporary power, nimble to give as any promise of the future. Del firmness in the right be onr motive, and adhesion to principle onr safeguard. Senator Trumbull, of llliuoia, who (with Chase, Browo, Sumner and other nnti-Orant Radicals) has been recom mended by tho “passireists” to Demo cratic support, utterly refuses the use of his name to soeb a connection, and toys:— The Democracy is yet too strong in num ber* to disband, for that is the meaiffhg of the passive policy. Three millions of Dem ocratic raters cannot afford to sell them •jlvn* to two or three hundred thousand Republican voters, and that for a mess of Cge which the Republicans and not the oerat* are to enjoy. I don’t believe they will do it, I think the passive policy already a failure." Senator Trumbull's views of the Democratic strength ara a sufficient answer to thane Radical journals who affiant to betinve the Democratic party dnad. Vice I’reeident Colfax, also, is ovidtntLy not of those who think the Democracy dead. While hopeful of bis patty ia 1872 be experts the can vac* will be exciting and sharply con tested. In bis opinion the Democracy is least dangerous when most confident, hot moat to be (eared when adversity has chastised them into prudence. The truth in, the party in not only foil of vitality, bat to-day embraces a clear majority of the voting population of the country, and that majority will demon atrate its powar at the ballot box, when tha Presidential quest ion comes np for Aha arbitrament of the people. Sueb is the outlook, at preaant, from the most .advanced political stood point, one arhioh ia calculated In inspire the party Pwith renewed hope and renewed coofi donee. Let the Democracy be of good cheer, nod prepare for a bold sod vigor ■iraa contact in 1872.

Viewed as an Ex | eentiva document, expected and requir ed to be a fall and complete expose of the condition of the country, it is a - thin and meagre affair. But it is evi ' dent that it was carefully prepared with an eapeeial view to the effect which it , may hare on the Presidential election, snd may bo called on electioneering card, rather than an Executive docu moot. “Data,” tho Washington cor respondent of the Baltimore Gazelle says: The Message has been the subject of dis cussion in private since its presentation to Congress. The general verdict of Repub licans is favorable to it on the whole. Here and there an outspoken criticism by prom mot men of that party iato the effect that tho Message is a cunning document: that . Grant proves himself to be a political trim mer ; that as a literary production it ia crude, and much below the average of Stale papers that have emanated from Ex acutivea for year* part. In this last criti cism Democrats coincide. Diroruanizbas.—The disorganizes in tho Democratic Conservative party are not very numerous or influential, but try to make up for their paucity of numbers and want of influence by their activity. Among the journals most prominent arc the St. Louis Republican, the Louisville Courier Journal, and the New \ork Il’orW. The most active letter writers arc Hon. John Quincy Adams, Geo. Francis P. Blair, and Hon. Montgomery Blair. The latter gentleman was Mr. Lincoln's Postures ter General, and hardly yet io a position to counsel the Democratic party. That party, from present indications, is likely to disregard the advice of all such coun sellors, anil to go into the Presidential contest with its organisation intact, snd with a candidate chosen from among (he tried tod true men of its own ranks Gov. Hoffman The New York Kcpreu says the Pott had no warrant for saying that Gov. Hoffman had re nounced hi* adherence to the Demo cratic parly, or would in his message proclaim, in substance, the dissolution of the parly. The absurdity of such a statement is apparent, at once, when it is remembered that Gov. Hoffman has not the party in bis keeping, and has as little power to proclaim its dissolu tioo as any other member of it. Quite so active contest is already in angnrated for the next Speakership of the House of Delegates. The names of Elias Griswold sod George Colton, of Baltimore city ; Andrew G. Chapman sod Frederick Stone, of Charles county, and Di. E. J. Ueokle, of Anne Arun del, are nil prominently mentioned in that connexion. lion John Merrymao, State Treas urer, will be a candidate for re election by tho new Legislature. Hon. Hubert Fowler, his predecessor, Police Commis sioner John W. Davis, of Biltimore, sad Hon. Barnes Compton, Speaker of the Senate, will be bis active eompeti tors for the place. The Legislature will meet on Wed nesday, the 3d day of January. The Governor's message and Comptroller’s report arc io (he hands of (he Printer. Gov. Whyte will be iuaugurated on the 10th of January. Bank Treachery One of the ed itora of ths Bachelor, published at Salts bury, Md , has deserted to the ranks of matrimony. We say to the turvieinj bachelor partner —“ go thon and do like wise.” The Grand Jury of Brooklyn, N. Y., on Saturday indicted two Democratic and five Republican inspectors of elec tioo for fraud.

I George Colton, editor of (he Annapolis ; Republican, ss the next Speaker of tho f House of Delegates. We endorse all . that has been said of him, and know I that if he is elected he will fill the po t sition with credit to himself and honor to tho House. He has served for two I sessions, and was one of the most active . and efficient members, and would dia . charge the duties of that position, if - elected, io an impartial wanner. The trial of Mrs. Ellen O. Wharton on tho charge of poisoning Geo. Wm Scott Ketchum, and Mr. Van Ness, in Balti more, commenced at Annapolis on Mon- day last. Mr. Revel), the State's At j toroey, ia assisted by Attorney General A. K. Syeslor. The defendant’s counsel sro I. Nevitt Steele, John 11. Thomas, g A. U. Hagner, and Herman Stump. A great many witnesses have been sum mooed and the ease has occupied all 0 ‘ the week, and will probably not be con eluded until sometime aczt week. Mrs. Wharton's daughter and a number of her friends attend her in the court room. t MB** Specie Payments.— The Conptroller . of tho U. S. Currency, throws cold f water upon all ideas of resumption of i specie payments, and speaks with an . authority that shows lie is backed by , the President and his Secretary of th e i Treasury. Not tho first gleam of hope ( is to bo found io the report that wo are ; ever to have anything like resumption. With 1,886 of National Ranks, and $54,000,000 of added bank capital, this • year, the Secretary seems to be irre pressible in favor of paper wouey and expansion. Railroad Matters.— Tho Kent County Railroad is expected to reach Cbestertowo, and the cars will run regularly to that place in about two weeks. The Berlin, Md. Railroad is finished within two miles of Snow llill. The new light house on Love Point, Kent Island, has boon cummouced by the contractors. For the Democratic Advocate. To the President and Directors of the Western Maryland Railroad. Outukbx:—l bare been requeued by par ties who frequently travel over the Western Maryland Railroad t intercede for them with a view of obtaining from you a redaction io the rite* of passenger fare. It seems to be the universal opinion of the patron* of the road that the present charge* are exorbitant, and tho purpose of ibis paper i* to discus* that question. Your petitioner* freely admit that Railroad companies are justified in adopting such a tariff as they believe will yield the sreatest net revenue, (within the provisions of their charter*,) withont regard to private Interest, and they recognise the fact that railroad traf fic is on the same basis precisely as all other merchantable matter, and that it would be just as unreasonable to expect your company to carry for a lets rate on the plea of public benefit, as it would be to expect a merchant to reduce the price of his cargo of sugar or coffee on the same principle. The value of nearly all articles bought and sold, is relative and not arbitrary, and a railroad ticket and a bnh. | of wheat are each worth whatever they will bring in open market. It is tine there are ex ceptionable cases where values are arbitrarr as in instances where the necessaries of life are in the bands of a few, and their purchase at any price becomes compulsory. The same reasoning will apply in some measure to aline of railroad baying no competition, where urgen cy demand* the use of it in the absence of any other means of transit. But at the same lima it most be borne in mind that railroads, when bu.lt bv private ,übecripti OH arc designed for individual benefit, amf aaftbesc roa<fa do not otherwise diminish the facilities for transpor tatioo they are much less amenable to the charge of extortion in consequence of what may ba considered as excessive rale*. Whether the Western Maryland Railroad, which has been, io a great measure, built by the comma nlty, and nut by individual enterprise, is more peculiarly bound to consider private interests, will not now be discussed. The oulj question jour petition'd uke Into consideration is, whether or not you can make s reduction on the preent rate, to the mutual benefit of jour patron, end the onmpenr. The argument frequently edrsneed by tr.reller. based on the comparative low rates on this and that road has no more force than the compere- f iT 2. ?, . ,Be t Wf 4 iV** 1 of r4in ,n H*ltimoraaj(l in St. Louis,and is not worth considering; but it is presumed.if it can be shown that a lower rate will probably yield a greater income, yon will accede to the request as here presented The average rate of fare oa yoar road b .boat t cu. per mile.

The new Directors then chose the following officers : President, Jesse Ucfsnider; Treasurer, B. W. Ben nett; Secretary, John T. Diffeubaugh. Wo understand that the Institution is in a flourishing condition, and the stock is considerably sought after. The Western Maryland Railroad. — The board of directors of the Western Maryland Railroad held a protracted meeting on Tuesday. It is understood that the board was principally engaged in making a thorough investigation into the financial condition uf the company, with a view of presenting to the city council ol Baltimore at uu early day a lull exhibit of the work, so that that body may bo in possession of data on which to base future legislation in con nection with the road, if deemed proper.

We do not consid er this a high price, when it ia taken into consideration that the mare gives evidence of being a fast .trotter, as has been frequently shown ou the truck of the Carroll Cour.’y Agricultural Society. The new Board of Commissioners fur this county organized uu Monday last and elected Josephus H. Hoppe, Esq., President, and Joseph Spurrier, Esq., Treasurer. We are con Aden t that these gentlemen will conduct the arduous duties of their positions with satisfaction to all who have dealings with the Board Ajfjtuintincuts. —The new Board of Commissioners have appointed lieu ben W.

Judgments Reversed. —At the recent term of the Circuit Court for Carroll County, the cases of Messrs. John Smith, David Shrivcr, George Schaeffer and Dr. J. L. BillingsVsa, vs. The Mayor and Common Council of Westminster, on appeals from the judgment of Abner Nesl, Esq., were heard by the Court 1 and judgments reversed. We believe the cases originated in the assessment 1 of the foreign stocks and private secur -1 ities of the appellants by the Corporate 1 authorities and a demand for the pay ' mcot of taxes thereon. Suita were ! brought before Justice Neal to enforce : this demand and judgments obtained i in favor of the Corporation. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court and re ! suited, as above stated, in a reversal of the judgments, not however, upon the main issue, but upon an error in the i oath taken by the Assessors of City property. As the error extends to the entire assessment the Mayor and Com mon Council arc without the power to 1 enforce the payment of any taxes levied thereunder. The question as to the Corporate authorities under the charter, to assess and tax foreign stocks, bonds and private securities was not decided by the Court. We understand that the City Council i has taken action in the premises and i resolved upon a new assessment. Messrs. * Elias Yiogling and John Bernstein 1 have been appointed Assessors and have already nualifled and will at once proceed to make said assessment. In the mean time the collection of taxes I will bo suspended and, for the present, i at least, our streets will bo iu darkness, a there arc no funds to pay tho gas bills. It is to be regretted that tho decision, in the oases mentioned above, did not . extend to the main issue. It has been a vexed question for several years, and a final judicial interpretation of tho pow ers of tho Council, in the premises, under the charter, is greatly lo be de •l cd— Sentinel.

From Washington. Washington specials state that Sec retary Boulwcll is lo be overhauled by Congress for a violation of the law in the negotiation of his $200,000,00i) loan. The act authorizing the loan pos itively forbids the paying of a higher commission for disposing of it than one half of one per cent. Ncverless, by a species of evasion, tho Secretary allowed tho European ring, or syndicate, who took $130,000,000, to pocket three month’s interest, iu addition to the one half of one per cent., which gives them nearly two per cent, for their services Tho amount lost lo I lie country by this sharp practice is about $2,000,000, u sum, it wounld seem, sufficiently large to be looked after.

The Postmaster General represents a deficit of over $6,000,000 in the postal ser vice for the current year. The Internal Revenue Report states the aggregate receipts Irom all sources, exclu sive of the direct tax upon lands and tax upon the national banks, at $144,011,176. Ibis sum includes tho amount refunded and allowed on drawbacks. The Commis sioner estimates the receipts for tho current fiscal year under the present law at $125,- 000,000. The total receipts for the past fiscal year from spirits were $40,381,848; from fermented liquors, $7,159,740 ; from tobacco. $83,578,097. The Commissioner mokes no recommendation in regard lo the income tax. The report of the Secretary of War stales that the reorganization of the army under the act of July 16, 1870, has been accom piished. the force numbering 80,000 men. The total expenditures for the last fiscal year ware about $40,000,000, a reduction of $17,665,675 from the expenditures of the previous year. The appropriation for the current fiscal year is $36,680,776, and the estimate for the year ending June 30, 1878, is $82,415,472. The Secretary of the Navy, in his report, estimates the expenditures for the navy for the next fiscal year at $19,925,507. These figures are $1,200,000 lees than the esti mates for the current fiscal year, and are made for the navy oa it is, but “needed improvements demand increased appropri ations.’’ The secretary recommends that the grade of Commodore be dispensed with, and promotions be made from the list of Captains to the grade of Rear Admiral. The small pox is prevailing iu the Petersvilla district of Frederick county. t The President's Message. We present to our readers the following ay j nopsis of the message, as prepared by the Bal more Sm, ; The third annual message of President Grant, * opens with a reiteration of the policy announo r oil in hia inaugural message. “The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom of the laws t already enacted, but to learn their spirit and - intent, and-to enforce them accordingly”—a 1 sentiment which, if literally adhered to, woald preclude the Executive from making many useful recommendations for tho repeal or mod - ideation of laws found to bo bad. The exceptional calamities by fire and flood , which have marked the past year, and which have led to the display of so much active be -9 nevidence and generous sympathy at home and J abroad, receive appropriate mention, while . the year Is recognised to have been, “under a wise Providence, one of general prosperity lo the nation.” f Under the bead of foreign relations, the country is properly congratulated upon the 5 beneficial effects likely to result from the treatv 5 of Washington, both ss a settlement of our dif ferences with Great Britain, and as an example ’ to the world how wars may be avoided without 2 a sacrifice of national honor. Credit is given to our diplomatic and consular agents at Paris for the manner in which they have performed their delicate duties without wounding the j susceptibilities of French or Gormans during the trying scenes in Franco of the past twelve months. , Some surprise will doubtless be fell lo find * M- Catacsxy elevated to the dignity of a na i tlonal grievance, and the purely personal dif ficulties betwoon that obnoxious eevoy and the administration at Waahington'deemod worthy | of a place in the President’s message. In for . mer cases, such as those of citixen Genet dur * ing the adminiatiatioo of Washington, and of Mr. Crompton, during tho Crimean war. It was the virlatiun of Isw rather of persooal or diplo malic proprieties, which incurred the ceosarc i of the Executive, and which waa brought lo q the attention of the nation. Reference is made to the diplomatic failure in Corea and lo the 1 success achieved by Admiral Rodgers over a s semi-barbarous people, and the whole subject is left “for such action as Congress may aee fit > The abolition of slavery by Brasil is made 3 the subject of presidential congratulation, and the enactment by Congress of a stringent law is recommended to reach the case of American , citixena who in their business dealings with t planters and others in countries where slavery is still tolerated by law mar become interested as mortgagees or otherwise in this i species of properly. The rumors which have been rife of pending difficulties with Spain, and possible iuterven , tiou in the affairs of Cuba, find no countenance in what U said in the message upon these heads. Taming from foreign lo domestic affairs, the first and most important recommendation of I the message is that both tho tariff and internal j laws bo modified, with a view lo lightening tho burdens at present imposed upon the country, i It is recommended that “all taxes from inter , nal revenue sources be abolished, except those collected from spirituous, vinous and malt liquors, tobacco in iu various forms, and from stamps,” which amounts to a tacit recommen dation lo abolish the income lax. In any re * adjustment of the tariff it is recommended*that those articles not produced at home, but which enter largely intogeneral consumption through medicines, compounds. Ac., and from which little revenue is derived, should he placed on tho free list, and that “should a further reduc tion bo deemed advisable, it should be made upon those articles which can beat bear it with out disturbing home production or reducing the wages of American labor.” This latter r i commendation bas the merit of being so ex ceedingly general that it probably will give no effeoao even to the most ardent protcctionisU. For particulars upon this bead Congress is re ferred to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The fluctuations in the currency aro deplored, and tho wisdom of Congress is in voked to find a remedy, which is tbe nearest the President comet to show ing any concern upon the subject of specie payments. The message reiterates the condemnation heretofore pronounced by the Secretary of thu Treasury upon the present infamous system of moieties to informers in the revenue service of the coun try—a system which, while condemned in theory, is* said in practice, however, pi flourish exceedingly. In the navy the employment of supernume rary officers in tho merchant service, (os in England and other countries,) and that jms motion above tho rank of captain be made by selection instead of seniority (* at present) seema to be recommendations woithy tbe at tention of Congress. The plan of aniline the telegraph service with the ordinary postal service of the country is urged upon the favureble consideration of Congress, as recommended by the Postmaster General, Tbe revenues of the department con tinue to improve. The measures taken for tbe enforcement of the KuMux law are next reviewed. The pro clamation of October 17 is justified upon the ground that (be requirements of the proclama tion of October 12 requiring tbe members of unlawful combinations witbm five days to sur render “all their arms, ammunition, uniforms, disguises, and other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlanful purposes had not been complied with. The existence of the “unlawful combinations,” 'purposes, “arms, “uniforms” and “imple ments is taken for granted. “A regular trial in tbe judicial tribunals of the United Slates is promised the parties who have been arrested. in numbers souAhundreds, and we may add also their conviction, inasmuch as it is added j “It is believed that no innocent per son is now in custody.” If a “regular” trial is to take place, lli* question of guilt or inno cence, one would hare supposed, might have been left to the “judicial tribunals.” A reign of terror baring been inaugurated, tbe fact that numbers of persons have “absconded,” is assumed to be “good ground for supposing that all such persons have violated the law “ the suppression of polygamy in Utah, with a provision for the legitimization of “innocent children” up to a certain date, is saggeated the latter only “as n suggestion, not a recom mendation.” The “peace policy” heretofore adopted by the administration with reference to the In duns, (though somewhat varied in practice bv exploits like those of the “IMegan” massacre) is recommended to be adhered to, “not only because it it humane, Cbristian-like and eco nomical, but because it is right.*' Political amnesty is recommended, upon tha ground, apparently, that no good comes from excluding a particular class of men from office because they had violated their oath to support the constitution, while thousands who would have done so had they been in the same posi tion are admitted to be eligible. U Is added “If there are any great criminals distinguished above all others for tbe part they took in op position to the government, they might, in the judgment of Congress, be excluded from such amnesty." It is needless to remark that such amnesty would not bo “general,” and that the very “exceptions” would go far lo defeat its eOect. Regret is expressed that tbe old cltl tens of tbe Southern States should not take a more prominent part in public affaire, bat the causes which biuder them from so doing teem to bo imperfectly comprehended. The wretched misrule of tbe carpet-bag governments of those States, now upheld by Ku-Klux legislation, has far more to do with their precent “unhappy condition than any feeling of personal hoslil itT°r “socia | ostracism” on the part of tbe older inhabitants toward those who differ with them in political sentiments. Natural causes such as climate, aoil, and the state of tbe labor question, with present mal-admlnlstration. have quite as much to do with retarding “im migration and tbe flow of mueh-ncedeff capl lal into the South as any of the can sea which tbe President enumerates.

Taken as a whole, tbe message Is of moder ate length, simple and unpretentious in iu style, rather negative than positive in its meriu, and certainly less aggressive in iu tone and recommendations than might have been apprehended, and perhaps, by a certain class of political extremisU and factionisU, waa de sired.
