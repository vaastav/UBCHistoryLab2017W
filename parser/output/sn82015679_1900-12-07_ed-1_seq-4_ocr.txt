The selection of Charles A. Towne to be the temporary successor of the late Sena tor Davis, of Minnesota, will give the coun try an object lesson In contrasts. SSSSSSBBSSSBBSBBBSSSBBaBSBSSSSSBBSSBBBBBSBaSSBSBSBBl A new departure in labor matters Is the presence of two women delegates at the invention of the American Federation of Labor In Louisville, who represent large constituencies of women workers. Officers in Cuba writing private letters home so far differ in opinion from official reports as to declare that they fear that the withdrawal of American authority will be followed by violent outbreaks. The opinion prevails in Washington that, owing to loss of position on the calendar and to conflicting views regarding the Hay Pauncefoto treaty- no Nlcaraguan canal bill will be passed at this session of Con gress. The announcement by LI Hung Chang that eighty Boxer leaders have been ex ecuted In one province of China within the last two months does not raise any fear that the country will be depopulated. There are others. If many preachers in West Virginia are like Mr. Wohl, who was killed while trying to kill another man who took offense at his personal preaching, the churches out side should send missionaries to them to teach them that pistoling is not advocated in the New Testament. When times are prosperous wo can stand the Immigration of considerable foreign la bor, but 413,572 immigrants, which was the figure the last Rscal year, mostly common laborers, is too much In a year, because, vhen the pinch comes and there is much less employment, there will be Idle men. The government should take care of its own. The Journal would not interfere with affairs not Its own. but it would suggest that it is a little early to form- a new party. If Mr. Bryan can control the Democratic organization, no other party is needed for the advocates of cheap money and pater nal government. If Mr.Bryan shall be re jected, he Is the natural leader of the new party, and the best name for it is not Federal, or American, or Federate, but Bryanite. A flippant paragrapher has named Sena tor Frye, of Maine, In connection with a "cash register," because he advocates the thip-subsldy bill. It is due to Mr. Frye to say that he has held for twenty-five years the same views regarding the duty of the government to encourage American ship ping, representing in the House a ship building district. Mr. Blaine, whom Mr. Frye succeeded in the Senate, was an advo cate of ship subsidies thirty years ago. It Is learned from a Boston paper that a bill will be presented in the Indiana Legis lature providing for the appointment of an expert commission to examine personally into the case of every man imprisoned for crime, that treatment, mental and physical, may be administered. It Is further stated that the commission will employ the best Indiana specialists. If such a measure j shall be proposed, it is safe to say that it will not survive the perlxl of third read ing. When the trouble began in China the peo ple r.f this country regarded Russia as the government which would be a menace to adjustment. Russia, it was thought, would want a large part of the ancient empire and would interfere in nil sorts of ways. We are all surprised now that Russia has been most favorable to moderate measures. To-day Russia is so near in accord with the policy of the United States that In his mes sage the President took occasion to declare that "in the event of protracted divergence of views in regard to indemnities," he would favor th submission of the Question to the Court of Arbitration of The Hague." rhla Is regarded as notice to tne other pow ern that unless the moderate measures sug gested by the United States are adopted the President will Join Russia. It Is stated c;i authority that everything looks favor able lor the adopt! on of the American plan. After so many discouraging reports re garding the action or nonaction of the powers as to the policy to be pursued to ward China, the pleasing announcement Is made that Great Britain and Germany have agreed to accept the views of the President and Secretary Hay and modify their elemands upon China. The demand at ftrtt submitted by Secretary Hay a 111 be presented to China in the form of an ulti matum. There will be no demand for the heads of eleven princes, and an Indemnity which China can pay will be demanded. This Is humane and just. Not only Is it a triumph for the United States as a world power, but for diplomacy based upon hu mane Fentiments. weakness of municipal ov i;hn3ii:nt. Close readers of Indiana paoers h ive d's covered that the present laws for the gov ernment of cities Which have not special charters are defective and out of line with the rule which generally prevails for gen eral and local governments. The last Legis lature gave representative government to counties and townships by separating the legislative or money-raising function from the money-expending or executive function. Reports have already shown the wisdom of the county and township legislation of ISS9.. Municipal government, by reason of the defective system, is Illogical and expensive in most cities. The mayor, who should be the chief executive officer, possesses few really executive functions. He holds Che Police Court and discharges other duties which are not well defined. On the other hand, the Council has both legislative and executive functions. It elects officers who should be responsible to the mayor, and, Jf it chooses, the Council's committees have charge of the expenditure of money which It has previously voted. Such practice is at variance with our system of govern ment, which distributes its powers to three classes of officers, the legislative, the ex ecutive and the Judicial. This system pre vails in the Nation, the State, the spe cially chartered city, and now In Indiana In county and township. The only excep tion in our system of government to this distribution of power 13 the majority of the cities of the State. In such cities the mayor should be the executive officer, and made responsible for the expenditure of every dollar voted by the City Council. There may be a city engineer, a superin tendent of streets, heads of the fire and police departments selected by the mayor and responsible to him. The function of tho Council should be legislative. Not a dollar should be expended which that body does not appropriate, and no contract should go Into force without its approval. Municipal government is the weak place in our system. Inefficiency and wasteful ness are rather the rule than the excep tion, and Jobbery 13 not infrequent. Still, the larger portion of the money the tax payer contributes is expended by the city or township government. The wonder is that hs does not recognize the fact and de mand an efficient and businesslike manage ment. The first step is to secure a better system by State legislation. Tim 

M'CALL policy of infamy. By his speech In opposition to the army bill Representative McCall, of Massachu setts, has enrolled himself in the ranks of unpatriotic and small Americans. His dis trlct embraces part of the city of Boston, and he has evidently fallen under the In fluence of the so-called Anti-imperialistic League which msts in that city. It Is a pity that a city which in other national crises has contributed so much to promoting patriotism and upholding the government should at this time be the chief headquar ters of a faction as unpatriotic as were the Tories of the revolution or the Blue-light Federalists of 1S12. Mr. McCall's speech against the army bill took the wide range of opposition to the entire Philippine policy of the administra tion. "He was plain-spoken," says the dis patch, "in his warnings of the dangers which lay ahead of the government if a colonial policy was persisted In." No per son has any idea of persisting in a colonial policy. In fact, there Is no such thine as a colonial policy. It is but a new name for imperialism, which the people branded as a fake in the recent election. No person thinks of persisting In the policy of terri torial extension. All that, is being done is to establish the authority of the United States in territory which has providentially and unexpectedly come into its possession. If using force to establish the authority of the government in territory that rightfully belongs to it is persistence in a colonial policy, then every President who has di rccted military proceedings against the In dians has been guilty of it, and Abraham Lincoln pursued it from the day of his elec tion to that of his death. Continuing, the report says: , Mr. McCall also criticised technically sev eral features of the bill, especially that lodging In the President the. discretion to expand or reduce the size of the army at will. In concluding he likened the uncon querable spirit which opposed our sway in the Philippines to that of Washington- at Valley Forge. Love of independence, h said, was the "noblest heritage of the hu man heart." He declared that the Fnitcd States should immediately give the Filipino people honorable asurance that they should have a government of their own. The provision of the army bill which gives the President the discretion to in crease or reduce the size of the army at will is a wise one. The power has been conferred on many Presidents, and has never been abused. Its object, of course, Is to enable the President to recruit the army up to the maximum, or to any point below the maximum that circumstances may require, and to reduce It to a peace basis as soon as circumstances will permit. This is clearly a measure of economy, and failure to adopt It would put It out of the President's power to reduce the expenses of the army when the occasion demanded It. It would. In effect, compel him to con tinue the army on a war footing in time of peace, awaiting the authority of Congress to reduce it. No person will deny that If we are to hold and govern the Philippines and man our seacoast defenses and military posts at home the army must be increased in the Immediate future to nearly lt,(U", the maximum proposed by the bill. The ! only alternative to this Is the abandonment ! of the Philippines, which would disgrace us before the world. The Increase of the army which Is now Imperative would not continue to be. In a few years, probably In two or three, the army could be ma terially reduced,and the chief executive of the Nation, the commander-in-chief of the army, should be given a free hand to mako the reduction as soon as circumstances will justify. Mr. McCall's criticism of this pro vision Is equivalent to a statement of lack of confidence in President McKinley and of unwillingness to confer on hlrn a discretion ary power that has been conferred on other Presidents. It Is difficult to read with any patience Mr. McCall's comparison of the treacherous Aguinaldo and the remnant of his throat- cutting followers to the American patriots at Valley Forge. The comparison Is an In sult to every patriotic American and a dis grace to the person who made it. "Gov ernment of their own," which Mr. McCall says should be guaranteed to the Filipinos, would mean the inauguration of an era of disorder and bloodshed such as would make the world exclaim in horror at the imbe cility" and cowardice of the United States in failing to establish law and order and free government In the islands. The McCall policy Is a policy of Infamy, and its sug gestion would come far more fittingly from what is left of the Filipino Junto In Hong Kong than from a member of the American Congress. The tobacco schedule of the amended in ternal revenue bill fixes a rate of 53 per thousand on cigars weighing over three pounds per thousand, 51 per thousand on those weighing less than three pound3, 53.G0 on cigarettes weighing over three pounds per thousand and 51.50 on those un der three pounds. Cigar manufacturers will pay $21 for annual sales over 200,000, 512 for sales between 100,000 and 200,000 and 53 for sales less than. 100,000. The total reduc tion on tobacco in all forms is estimated at 52.1S9.7C4. Whether thi3 will reduce the price to consumers remains to be seen. 

BUBBLES IN THE AIR. The PInce to Stop. "Castles in the air are expensive." "No; not if you don't try to live In them." Gastronomic Argument. Roast turkey and cranberries raethlnks would go far To convince Filipinos of the folly of war. The Old (lullI-Peii.

"He'll never consent to wear a waxed mus tache." Pleasant and Inexpensive. "We are going to economize this winter, and have a rummage Christmas." "What's that?" "Why, everybody give everybody else some thing real nice that they want to get rid of." LESSONS FROM THE MESSAGE. The message ends with a warning against extravagance. The congressional weather forecasts give every Indication that it 13 needed. New York Journal (Dem.) The effect of this message ought to bo most reassuring upon the material and moral Interests of the country. There Is not In it a line of cowardly surrender or abandonment of duty, but, on the contrary, a courageous facing of responsibilities which must strike a sympathetic chord in the hearts of all manly Americans. Minne apolis Tribune. And the lesson which the President has gathered primarily from the century-end signs of the times, of which the election mutt be the most prominent, is one which would appeal only to the mind whose first thoughts were of country: "The Republic was never so strong, because never so strongly intrenched In the hearts of the people as now." New York Press. Nothing is more important in the message than the closing words of caution. Recog nizing the condition of prosperity which prevails and the abundant revenues of the country, he wam3 Congress against ex travagance, arguing that wise economy in a season of plenty will not abate but strengthen confidence, will not retard but will promote commercial prosperity. Min neapolis Journal. This comprehensive and calmly strong pa per ends with a paragraph which is prob ably as Important, In one sense, as any in It It Is a grave and dignified caution not to let material prosperity or party success, however great, lure us Into extravagance of any kind. We can and should be liberal. Waste is always crime. It is a caution that Congress needs. It is given with serious simplicity and emphasis. Denver Times. The concluding passages of the message show unequivocally that President McKin ley is fully alive to the dangers that may ensue from the growing power of the Re public. "Our growing power," says he "brings with it temptations and perils re quiring constant vigilance to avoid. It must not be used to invite conflicts, or for oppression, but for the more effective main tenance of those principles of polity and Justice upon which our institutions de pend." As a state paper the message will rank among the most Important that have ever been sent to Congress by the Nation's chief magistrates. Baltimore- Herald (Ind.) In regard to foreign countries the para graph that Is likely to cause the most dis cussion is the uncompromising language President McKinley uses in regard to the Alaskan boundary. He docs not hesitate to pronounce the joint survey and compromise boundary "an unsatisfactory makeshift, which should not be suffered to delay the speedy and complete establishment of the former line to which we are entitled under tho Russo-American treaty for the cession of Alaska." If this statement does not come dangerously near to rupturing the much-talked-of good will between this country and Canada the latter must have changed considerably since the adjourn ment of the Joint high commission at Que becChicago News. A careful perusal of President McKInley's message, keeping in mind his first message to Congress, impresses tho thinking reader with the fact that within four years the Republic has made marked changes and has not only become a world power but in itself is colossal. Time was when as many as eighteen thousand words were consumed in the discussion almost entirely of domestic affairs with half a dozen para graphs addenda, to to speak, devoted to foreign relations. In Mr. McKInley's last message the contrast is so great that It Is startling. In no country In the world arc the United States without interest. Within a few years we have gained possessions in every soa. We have become factors in the tremendous problems of the East and the West. Memphis Commercial Appeal (Dem.) WAR ON 

GLASS MAKERS. Philadelphia Paint Clnl. Wnrklng for Reduction of Tariff. PHILADELPHIA, Dec 6. At a meeting of the Philadelphia Paint Club last night the first step was taken in the direction of a general movement to resist what Is considered an unjust demand upon the Job bers ot paints and glass by the window glass manufacturers. It Is stated that no tice has been served by the manufacturers o.-i all their customers that if they expect to continue their business relations they must agree not to handle any foreign-made glass, unless it Is the output of a factory for which some member of the manufac turers' combination has the agency In th United States. The paint club decided to at onco set about enlisting all organlza tiens in the trade throughout the United States in an effort to flight what the mem bers regard as a most unjust demand. It is hoped by correspondence, petition and as sistance of other commercial organizations to crystallize the sentiment of th country in the direction of n revision of the tariff on more equitable lines.

He Sayn Strike Are Becoming; Fewer as Waste Eurners Organize Xo Sex or Color Line Permissible. - LOUISVILLE. Ky., Dec. C The twen tieth annual convention of the American Federation of Labor began here in Music Hall this morning. The American flag was very much in evidence in the way of deco rative effect. When the president's gavel announced the opening of the first session 217 dele gates took their seats, and the hum of conversation which for the last half hour bad filled the hall subsided and the con vention was on. Among the delegates present were repre sentatives of tho British Trades Union Congress and the Canadian Trades and Labor Congress, thrte women delegates and two colored. President Gompers in a few words introduced William M. Higgins, edi tor of the Irish-American of Louisville, who delivered the address of welcome, to which President Gompers replied. Following President Gompers's address Thomas Tracey, of Boston, chairman of the committee 6n credentials, presented the report of that committee. . The reading consumed some thirty minutes' time and was substantially as follows: The committee had examined the cre dentials of 205 delegates, representing o'l national and international unions, 1Q state branches, 42 central labor unions, M local trades unions and 2 foreign federations. The report was unanimously adopted and the delegates seated. President Gompers then began his an nual address. "Our economic and social life presents to us new and complex problems," he said. "The century now opening be fore us requires the keenest appreciation on the part of all that upon ourselves and upon our unity In sentiment, conviction and action lies the safety of the future manhood, womanhood and childhood of our country. There have been no rights accorde'd unless they have been conquered through unity, the wisdom nnd the willing ness of those who have acquired them to bear burdens and make sacrifices. What is true of the past is true of the present and will be equally true in the future. To organize the yet unorganized workers, to build up national and international unions, to make our organizations more effective to defend the toilers, to protect and pro mote their interests in every way, to as sure beyond all peradventure, the vantage ground already gained, to progress con tinually in abolishing that'wh'ch the work ers, their wives and their children have too long borne and the. achievement of that justice to which they are entitled. The success of these as typified by our great cause now and for all time to come rests entirely upon the. working class itself. 

GROWTH IN ORGANIZATION. "The past year has witnessed a most re markable growth in organization among the workers who have realized that there is no protection of their interests and hope for their freedom and Justice in the future unless it results trom the unity of tho wage-working masses. While the growth is very gratifying, there is another feature connected with it which is even a greater source of congratulation. The workers have organized in the unions of their trades and callings, new unions have been ! formed and several national unions created ! from heretofore scattered and isolated lo cals, and thus the stability of the labor movement has been more nearly insured. "We have issued direct from the Ameri can Federation of Labor during the past year 04 charters to national and interna tional unions, 11; state federations of la bor, 5; city central labor unions, VG; local trades unions having no national, fed eral labor unions. We had at the end of the fiscal year Oct. SI, 1000 alii Mated with the American Federation of Labor: National and international unions, &2; state federations, ltt; city central labor unions, 206; local trade unions and federal labor unions, 1,051.' There were issued during the year from national and international unions and the American Federation of Labor di rect charters to the following: Newly formed unions, 3.275; charters surrendered or unions disbanded, 318, leaving a net in crease of local unions for the year of 2,027 I and a gain in membership of 2id.S29. "Our movement seeks and has to a con siderable extent secured a diminution in the number of strikes, particularly among the best organized. In fact, the number and extent of strikes can be accurately gauged by the extent, power and financial resources of an organization in any trade or calling. The barometer of strikes rises with lack of or weakness In organizations and diminishes with the extent and power of the trade union movement. Through more compact and better equipped trade unions have come Just agreements and con ciliations between the workmen and asso ciated employers, and only when concilia tion has failed has it been necessary to re sort to arbitration. "It Is strange how much men desire to compel other men to do by law. What we desire to achieve is freedom through or ganization. Arbitration is only possible when voluntary. It never can be success fully carried out unless the parties to a dis pute or controversy are. equal or nearly equal in power to protect and defend them selves or to inflict Injury upon the other. The more thoroughly the workers are or ganized In their local and national unions and federated by common bond, policy and polity, the better shall we be able to avert such strikes and lockouts by such concilia tion, and, If necessary, arbitration; but it must be voluntary arbitration or there should be no arbitration at all. NO SEX OR COLOR LINES. "Realizing the necessity for the unity of tho wage earners of our country, the American Federation of Labor has upon all occasions declared that trades unions should open their portals to all wage workers. Irrespective of creed, color, na tionality, sex or politics. Nothing has transpired in recent years which has called for a change in our declared policy upon this' question. Upon the contrary, every evidence tends to confirm us in, this con viction; for, even if it were not a matter of principle', self-preservation would prompt the workers to organize Intelli gently and to make common cause. In making the declaration we have, we do not m'cessarily proclaim that the social barriers existing between the whiles and blacks of the country should or could bo felled with one stroke of the pen, but when white and black workers are com pelled to work side by side under the same adverse circumstances, and under equally unfair conditions, it seems an anomaly that we should refuse to accord the right of organization to workers on account of a difference in their color. Unless we should give the negro workers the opportunity to organize, and thus place them where they can defend themselves against the rapacity and cupidity of their employers; unless we continue the policy of endeavoring to make friends of them, there can be no question that they will not only be forced down in the economic scale and be used against any effort made by us for our economic and social advancement, but race prejudice will be made more bitter and to the injury of all. "The alien contract labor law falls far short of accomplishing what it was orig inally intended to do, for the reason that violators of the law are easily and sys tematically coached how to pass the In spection. The enactment of wise and be neficent legislation in the Interest of the toll ing masses of -our country must still be demanded until all the wrongs from -which the toilers suffer are abate-d. We insist upon the enforcement of the rights to which we are entitled. Unless we. as the organized wage-earners of the country, protest against the wrong, and demand the establishment of the right, we shall lose the confidence and respect of the organized, as well as the unorganized toilers of Amtr ica, who will hold that we have failed to avail ourselves of all the opportunities which are presented In order to seek re dress through the proper channels. It cannot be denied that much faster and greater progress can be made and will be made, provided we are firm in our deter mination to achieve It, unceasing in our efforts and undivided in our course." THE SECRETARY'S REPORT. Frank Morrison, the national secretary, reported that the receipts were 534.2CS more than last year, 52,752 having been added to the general balance. The receipts from per capita tax, 542.0S5, were notable and en couraging. The expenses increased 538,774 a large portion. 516,209. being for salaries and expenses of general organizers, the usual number of whom (twenty) were com missioned and kept at work assisting the nationals and internationals to strengthen their unions, and forming new unions di rectly affiliated with the American Federa tion of Labor. During the fiscal year char ters were issued to 3.743 affiliated unions, the gain in membership being 200.416, in cluding 44.G58 In 755 local trades and federal labor unions chartered direct by the Ameri can Federation of Labor. "The American Federation of Labor," said Secretary Mor rison, "is now in a position, numerically and financially, to accomplish during the coming year more remarkable results that have been achieved during the present year. Members of unions are beginning to realize that higher dues ,and united action are necessary for success. The organiza tion and affiliation of fourteen national and international unions to the federation dur ing the past year is ample proof of the desire for closer affiliations." Treasurer John B. Lennon reported re ceipts of $7I,G75 and expenses of 5GS.373. The total funds on hand amount to 512,301. "Withdrew from the State Federation.

JESSIE MORRISON ILL TRIAL OF SHIS. CASTLE'S SLAYER MAY HE DISCOXTIXLEIJ. The Prisoner on the Verj?e of Col lapseTestimony for the Defense Introduced Ycjttcrday. ELDORADO. Kan., Dec. 6. Testimony in favor of Jessie Morrison was taken to-day, tho prosecution finishing its side ' of the case soon after the opening of court. The prisoner showed signs of physical and men tal collapse, and it was only by great effort that she was able to remain in the court room during the day. The defense suc ceeded in contradicting some of the prose cution's evidence. The record of tha pre liminary trial was brought in to quote the testimony of Mrs. Spangler, who first said she had not seen anything in Miss Morri son's hand on the day of the tragedy, and who, during the present trial, testified that she had seen something resembling a knife in the prisoner's hand. The defense intro duced a witness who said that Rev. Dr. Wharton, who was pastor to both Mrs. Castle and Miss Morrison, had in conversa tion said that the only thing the defense could do would be to plead insanity for Miss Morrison. On the stand yesterday Rev. Wharton testified that he had never talked to any one regarding an insanity plea. Jlhs Morrison fainted last night as she reached her cell after a tcying day in the courtroom. She had revived somewhat this morning and was more cheerful, but was pale and weak. Judge Redden this morn ing escorted her from the Jail to the court room. Captain Waters, who is leading for the prosecution, is quoted as saying he had expected that a continuance would be asked by the defense. - "It is plain," said he, "that she is getting weaker, and it Is no wonder. It would not surprise me to have presented at any time a physician's certificate to the effect that Jessie Morri son could not go on with the trial." Such a continuance would postpone the trial In definitely and make necessary the selec tion of a new Jury and a rehearing of all evidence. Judge Morrison, father of the defendant, gave the most Important testimony for her during the day. He said that he saw his daughter at home shortly after the assault. "Oh. papa, oh. papa, why did you call me in?" he testified were her first words when she saw him. "I fear I have killed her." "Did she say murdered her?" was asked. "No." While he was testifying the aged Judge Morrison wept. The defepdant and her sisters also cried. Judge Morrison was the last witness of the day.-. Patrick Sayn the Will Was Forged. NEW 

YORK. Dec. 6. Albert T. Patrick, now in the Tombs on charges. of forgery, through his attorneys filed an answer to day in the Surrogate's Court to the peti tion for the probate of the will of Wm.

WANTS THE CANAL BUILT SBXATOR 31 ORG AX WILL I'RGE THE IST1I3IIAX' WATERWAY DILL, Regardless of Action on the liar Pauiteefote Treaty His Speech iu Executive Session. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. The Senate was In executive session for more than four hours to-day, the, entire ttme being de voted to the discussion by Senator Morgan of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty for the abro gation of the portion of the Clayton-Bul-wer treaty which relates to the Nicaragua canal. The senator made it very plain in the course of his remarks that while he was not opposed to the pending treaty in almost any form, his principal if not his only concern in that connection is for the passage of the canal bill, and he allowed it to be very, broadly understood that he had engaged in the treaty discussion be cause of his convictions that there were a majority of senators who would Insist upon action upon the treaty as a condi tion precedent to the passage of the canal bill. For this reason he said he was will ing to discuss the treaty. He intimated privately to other senators, however, that he would not consent to the fixing of a time for a vote upon the treaty until there also could be a time fixed for like action upon ths Nicaragua canal bill. In -the course of his speech Senator Mor gan said he did not in reality consider that the treaty need have any special bearing on the bill, and that he believed it was competent for the United States to pro ceed with the building of the canal re gardless of the treaty or of Great Britain's wishes in the matter, but to satisfy other senators and also to meet the wishes of the secretary of .tute, for whom he Inci dentally expressed the highest esteem, he would consent to action upon the treaty and do all he could for it. He would vote for the agreement whether it should be amended or not, though he would prefer that there should be no amendment. Discussing the question of the fortifica tion of the canal Senator Morgan argued strenuously against it both as inexpedient and unnecessary. He contended that Great Britain was not the only power whose interests would be affected by a provision for fortification, and said that Nicaragua and Costa Rica had a right to be con sidered in that connection. Furthermore, In case of war everybody knew that the canal would be protected to the fullest ex tent, so that any provision whatever bear ing upon this point was needless. He ad mitted, however, that he had no doubt that if the United States should proceed with the construction of the canal with out first taking steps to secure the neutral ity of the canal Great Britain would be grievously offended, and that he thought it not Impossible that the offense would be considered sufficiently grave to lead to hos tilities between the two countries. ' "Do you mean," asked Senator Bever idge, "that, notwithstanding the present friendly relations between the countries, England might eleclare war if we should construct the canal with our own means and in our own way?" Senator Morgan replied that ho consid ered that result among the probabilities. "But," he continued, "1 should not be de terred by that circumstance. What Eng land would do," he said, "of course was a mere matter of speculation," and added that he had only referred to this pos sibility in order to emphasize his opinion that the canal should be constructed in any contingency. The American people, he said, had mapped out that canal, and they were not going to allow any obstacle, no matter how serious, to stand in the way. He believed the administration that would undertake to build the canal, know ing that to do so meant war, would be in aorsed by the people at ?arge by a bigger majority than that which McKinley had received over Bryan in the last election. Senator Morgan was plied with many questions by Senators Mason, Bcveridge, Tillman and others. Mr. Mason asked whether it was true that if the Hay Pauncefote negotiation prevented the use or" the canal by Great Britain in time of war the converse proposition that it also prohibited such use by the United States was not also true. To this Mr. Morgan did not make direct reply, sajing that he would tako up that point later In his dis cussion. In discussing the points of the treaty with Senator Teller, the Alabama senator expressed the view that the Clay ton Bulwer treaty Is unconstitutional, and for this reason. If for no other, said it should be disregarded. 

TYPHOID IN THE CAMPS. Snrgeon General Sternberg's Report on the Disease In the Army. WASHINGTON, Dec. G.-Surgeon Gen eral Sternberg to-day made public a report upon tho origin and spread of typhoid fever in the United States military camps dur ing the Spanish war of 1898, prepared at his instance by the board consisting of Major Walter Reed, surgeon U. S. A.; Major Victor C. Vaughan, division surgeon U. E. V.. and Major Edward O. Shakespeare, brigade surgeon U. S. V. Tho surgeon general prefaces the report by calling at tention to the vast amount of work the medical corps was called upon to perform during the war in order to cope with the tremendous increase of the army. in the field, and comments on the widespread prevalence of typhoid In 189S, 20,000 cases of this disease appearing among the troops encamped within the limits of the United States from May until September of that year. A general summary of the conclusions reached by the board indicates that during the Spanish war every regiment constitut ing the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fiftn and Seventh Army Corps developed ty phoid fever, this being true of both the volunteer and regular commands. More than 90 per cent, of the cases are shown to have developed within three to five weeks after the tents went up. Typhoid became epidemic in all camps, large and small. North and South, and was found to be so widely distributed In this country that one or more cases were likely to appear in any regiment within eight weeks after assem bly, whether on the march or stationary. It Is also stated that, with typnoid fever as widely disseminated as it is in this country, the chances are that if a regi ment of Ll'OO men should be assembled in any section, and kept in a camp having the most perfect sanitary conditions, one or more cases of the fever would develop. Nevertheless it was found that many com mands during the war wore unwisely lo cated, that the space allotted to regiments was, in some instances, entirely inade quate, and that rnr.ny regiments were al lowed to remain on one site too long. Except where urgent emergency makes It necessary, the board suggests that one regiment should not be located In a place vacated by another. It Is recommended that the soldier;' beds should be raised from the ground, for the men are reported to have slept In dust-piles possibly Infected with typhoid germs, and also that the soldiers be made to remove their outer clothing at night, wherever possible.

The ruling of the distinguished Judge decided that free speech in this com monwealth was not to Ie birred and that actions, to succeed If brought Into court, must prove malice on the part of the ne ws papers, that there are privileged statements In politics that are not actionable."

Dec C.-The State De partment to-day received a formal protest from R. H. May, the American engineer who was forcibly detained in Guatemala against the proceedings of the officials there. May submits an affidavit through S. A. Wltherspoon, who he names as his at torney. Mr. WItherspoon's paper is dated New Orleans, Dec. 4. May says that he is a citizen of Mississippi, temporarily resid ing in Guatemala, where an arbitration has just been determined In his favor by the British minister, Mr. Jenner. After that matter had been decided May left Guate mala City and went to Port Barrios, where, on the 29th ultimo, he attempted to embark on the steamer Stillwater for New Orleans. He had procured a passport and had ap pointed an attorney of record In the person of William F. Fuqua to represent him in the country in any Judicial precess agair.ht him. When he (May) was ejected from Guatemala Oct. 2S by the military authori ties he owed his employes on the Northern Railroad about 512,0"0 In Guatemalan money, which he was unable to pay on ac count of the failure of the Guatemalan gov ernment to pay him 5113.4 American gold lately awarded to him. One James Wilkcn son sued May and secured a writ of deten tion, forbidding him toj leave the country until his claim was settled. May says that Article 74 of Decree 273 is the only proviso under which a person can be prevented from leaving the country, yet that article permits departure when an attorney of rec ord is appointed. Mty says. that he was prepared with a formal instrument and pre sented it to the Guatemalan onicers, hhow Ing that he hau appointed such an attorney In the person of Fuqua. "Notwithstanding this," says May, "I was forcibly nelzed. pulled off the gangway of the ship, and thereby prevented from cunlng to the United States, and am now detained at Guatemala." The affiant concludes with a list of wit nesses to support his statements, and re quests the State Department to demand his Immediate release and the payment to him of an Indemnity of 53,000 damages "for said willful and malicious wrong."
