Tho Mormon leader? must either yield or flee. BJ Which will they do? And when will they do It? ' If t'were done 't'were well It were done quickly." The longer the present situation Is protracted the more ns;onlz!n will be the settlement The longer the fight continues the more costly will he the strife and the more difficult will be the reconstruction. Which will it be, and when" Ppon the answer, depends the fate of the Mormon people. There will be too many, we fenr, who will not be able to do Christmas shop ping either early or late. But the Council cannot see the de sirability of the Mill creek water offer even with a lawsuit thrown in. Gamblers are not advertising any bargains In their line, even If they are going out of business In the near fu ture. Are the gamblers going to be unrea sonable enough to complain If the city decides to quit fining them every About the only objection Brother Fernstrom ran see against Brother Taylor's bill against the city Is that It rather small. Furthermore, the city administration Is sure that Moses W. Taylor should be paid tbo sum of $500, as the church would get $50 of it. Prof. Hyatt, by furnlshlug good ice for the holidays, can please the young folks and the dealers In skates at one and the same time. It appears that all that the new post office needs to bo a model one la a i omplete change In the arrangements for doing business In It.

TBTE GAMBLING PROBLEM. The Tribune demands 'hat the rob bing gambling gamSfl In this city be losed up. Tt has designated the chief offenders In this direction, and calls upon the administrative officials of this city to do their duty under the law. They know thee resorts better than w an show thm. They know the law They knew thHr sworn duty. Thy are forsworn If they do not do It. There must he an end of this damn able robbery. Laboring men, minors, Oerks. trusted agents, are beguiled into gambling dens, are pllt-d with liquor and arc rrilib.-.l, with not oven the Ptn.ill chance of the one who coos agtlln8f the ordinary chancea of a gambling game, to win it Ls criminal robbery that is prepetritted upon them. It Isn't a game of chance that they play, for they have no chance whatever to win. Think of the case where a man, so lm brutcd as to steal and pawn his wife's wedding ring for about half Its value, and so Infatuated with the game, so en thralled In the vice so alluringly held out to him, that ho resorted in the gam ing tables, and then think of his rc morSS and anguish on losing it all! And think if the horror of the wife on learning of the depraved act which the man she has sworn to love, honor and obey, had committed, when she learned the awful fact! Who, unmoved with disgust and wrath, could think of such a case? Remember, also, the man who came here to engage In business, but who was enticed Into a gambling hell and robbed of all his ready money, so completely looted that he had to pawn his ov rcoal to get the money to take himself and his wife out of town. And realize, If you can, the loathing and shame thai wife must have felt over this terrible, outcome of what was a fair prospect of an honored and promising business life, and a career that promised such winsome outlook. Again, note the case of a boy of eighteen, who was lured into a den, and rohbeJ of his pitiful savings, accumu lated through some years of toil and self-denial. Is It not enough to mak the blood boll against the miserable scoundrels who perpetrated this abom inable outrage? These arc but a few cases of the great number of merciless, savage plu kings that have occurred within a brief time And backing It Is a hierarchy that con trols the city absolutely, a negligent set of accomplices as city officials, and a police force that knows all the facts and lifts not a finger to enforco the law or succor the victims. THE MILL CREEK OVERSHOT. It Is a matter for congratulation that the proposed Mill Creek negotiations were stopped by the Council on Monday night. The Mayor's proposed wasteful and reckless negotiations were bad enough. In all conscience, when they dealt with water rights that were valid; but when it comes to negotiating on the same prodigal basis for rights that are In dispute, and that aro actually (.rt liti gation In court that Is. buying Into a lawsuit the lnconslderateness of It was too glaring even for the church's Council before which It came, and w hich has hitherto sturdily sustained whatever was proposed, no matter h"w Injurious to the city, nor how far It de parted from the pledges given to the taxpayers during the bond election cam paign. This Mill Creek water which It was proposed to obtain by these cloudy ne gotiations would be had, If at all. on the same profligate and cut-throat terms as those carried In the contracts with the Big Cottonwood farmers. That Is, for the two million gallons which are sought, the city will give two million flve hundred thousand gallons. It Is a sheer throwing away of the city's re sources to deal on those terms. In fact, the city Is much worse off on Its water supply right now than It was before it voted the bonds pr entered Into any ne gotiations at all on this new deal. DOING THE RIGHT THING. It is encouraging to note that the City Council can be moved by public discus sion to do the right thing Not long ago a taxpayer wrote to The Tribune Inquiring as to the right of the Council to demand advance payment for local lmpro enicnt s. and to hold the money for long periods; also, as to why It re tained mney collected under promise of making certain Improvements, after It had abandoned all- Intention to make such Improvements. Mr. Eramel. Assistant t'lty Attorney, made a fair statement, in reply, show ing that the Council had made post ponement of Hrne for payments in post poned work, but as he was not author ized to say anything about refunding money on work paid for but abandoned, he very properly omitted to mak men tion of It. We note, however, that In the Council Monday evening. Mr Tuddenham in troduced a resolution dealing compre hensively with this question, and the Council promptly passed It. The reso lution not only suspends payment on work nnt compute,, hut it directs that the money already paid on such work not done, he, refunded to th payers. This Is the right thln. It covers the whole c;ise The persons who have paid Will Ret their money, and they will not be called upon again to pay on any work that has not been ordered, bul nothing will be collected on work that Is abandoned. The American victory Is not deold of power, It appears, to correct some plar Injr Injustices, oven before Its officials get Into their offices. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The key-note of the President's mes sage is National control of gnat cor porations, it is argued, and the proof goes with the argument, that the States are unable to control these vast con cerns whose business Is In many States; In some cases. Indeed, the State Is un abl to reach thoSS Interstate combina tions In nny effective way. We believe i that til thought of the leading tin n of the country, as Wl II SS the SSntimt fll Of the masses of th people, ls with the proposition for National control And still, the conflict would come on the methods proposed whereby to exercise that control. And there would be the difference of opinion. There Is evidently a long and fierce fiKht to win before the National regulation can be made effect ive. This the President sees, and he asks definite legislation. In order to find out the limitations, If there are any, to the programme of effective National su pervision. The railroad rate question will al ways be a troublesome one. and caution In handling It Is enjoined by the Presi dent. The block signals, public ac counting, lesser hours, labor problems, race suicide, are dealt with vigorously. On the question of life insurance he probes deeply, and suggests that Fed eral supervision may be Imperative. And while calling for reform here, he also demands reform In public affairs, in the departments, and In elections. He exults over the peace settlement, and tlenounces wars of aggression, but holds that It would be madneps for the Nation to disarm, and he urges a strong navy to enrorce tne iuonroe aoctrine, and for defense; and the importance of ceiast defenses Is dwelt upon. The President urges revision of the naturalization law?; of the criminal laws; he calls for the highest type of citizenship, and for the enforcement of the civil servh c law. He gives warm words of commenda tion to the Irrigation reclamation ser vice, and favors the encouragement of j our merchant marine. The Indian question. National parks. Alaska, Hawaii. Porto Rico, and the Philippines come In for special consider- 1 atlon; as to the latter, the President considers self-government a matter for the remote future The Panama canal comes In for de tailed mention, and the need of further provision of money to push the work Is referred to. The message closes with a review of the condition of our diplomatic and i consular service, w hich Is taking on In creasing Importance, and for which fur ther and more appropriate consideration ' should be extended by Congress. It Is a long message, but it ls a very able and strong one It has many sub jects to deal with, and It deals with them pointedly, and with exact knowl edge, and with a perfect exposition of President Roosevelt's opinion about j each, and of what he considers should be done. It ls such a mesasge as the i American people delight to read, and WS j believe that this messace will receive more general perusal than any Prsl- ' dent's message has received for many years , A
