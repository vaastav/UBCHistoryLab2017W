Army and 1 BY CAPT. ARTH1 T THE ARMY * * FACING the possibility of at least a temporary discontinuation of Army recruiting. It has been suggested that the recruiting division, with its efficient organisation, exert its efforts in building up the national and state guard and also recruit for a National Reserve Corps, which. Con cress recently authorised. The Re- | serve Corps at present Is not in a coordinate state. Methods of increasing Its membership do not synchronize? , each corps or branch of the Army acts for itself in its own way. The recruiting division of the Regular Army, as it stands today, is a strong, energetic organization. Its beneficial work is evidenced by the large number of recruits secured in every section of the country. The energy and experience of the recruiting division might be utilized as a means of building up the present skeletonized Reserve Corps to the quota deaired by Congress. Anthony on "Promotions." That recent Army promotions will not be confirmed by the committee ' on military affairs without due con- ) aideration is indicated by statements J from members of Congress who are 1 giving the subject their attention. ' At the office of Representative Daniel R. Anthony, Jr. (Kan.), a confirmation was given to his recent state lent in one of the leading service papers, which read as follows: "There is a feeling that the Intent f Congress has not been faithfully carried out by the War Department, especially as to the provision that at least 50 per cent of the new commissions created should be from { without the Regular Army. Under i the way they have interpreted the [, law they have arranged it so every . graduate of West Point in the last'; live classes has been made a major. , All West Point graduates of over live years' service will reach the grade of major and all the rest probably that of captain. In other words, the : increased rank was not faiyly passed , i around to the men who fought in this war." i Bearing out the West Point state- < ' ment of Mr. Anthony, the fact exists < that hundreds of youngsters from the 1 academy have been pushed ahead eo i fast during the past five years that the percentage of appointees from < the regular and emergency forces will be left far behind tn future pro- j motions. It is a lamentable fact that < few of the emergency officers recently appointed were given better than a captaincy, although a number of t them were men with years of pro- c fessional, technical or business train- . ing. which experience cost the government absolutely nothing. On the I other hand. West Pointers?for ex- I . ample, the class of 1915?were young- t Sters. educated at government ex- c sense for a period of four years, dur- I r ing which time they received the a liberal pay of a cadet, and were ap- 7 pointed second lieutenants In' 1915, e grst lieutenants in 1918. captains In c 1917 and majors in 1920. Their pres- n nt pay. with allowances, is in ex- h esse of 85.000 a year, or a sum great- b 4 or than is paid to an assistant sec- s rotary of the Treasury* n o Appointment to General. r Representing "the line" from which J Be sprang, the recent appointment of I* OsL Alexander K.

Comment to rife aa to who will he t . the next Secretary of War. It to t J Stnown that many Army men would i V prefer to oerve under a civilian Secre- f tary. There ia some talk of the appointment of Gen. Pershing or Wood t and. under the law. either could be appointed to the office by retiring j from the Army or by being placed on the inactive list without pay. Both generals have their quota of friends , in and ojit of the service, who would , like to see their favorite occupying the role of Secretary. It In known that Gen. Pershing is close to President-elect Harding, as Is also Gen. Wood. The record made by Gen. Pershing in the world war adds to . his prestige as a prospective Secretary, although eome of his friends believe his popularity has not been strengthened by heading the -recent appointment board. The stand that Gen. Wood took In promoting preparedness prior to the war will be one of hie chief assets for- the Secretaryship. No intimation, however, has come from Mr. Harding as to his wishes regarding this portfolio and hts decision may not be determined i for some time. Iw event a civilian iaj appointed Secretary the Army wilt he specially interested aa to who will be , the next thief of staff. There are seme excellent general officers available for this appointment and the question of who will be chosen to fill this office occasions more or less general comment and surmise. Borers to Supplaat Autos. "In fifteen or twentr vears. when the supply of gasoline la either (one or the price too high for * person of ordinary means, the horse will again become a necessity in rural districts, and future venerations will owe a debt of gratitude to those who are laboring against odds to preserve good blood, especially In the riding animals." This is the gist of an article from flu December issue of the Remount, the official organ of the American Remount Association, which depicts the shortage of well bred riding horses, particularly the type necessary In a good cavalry horse. "It Is an extremely important thing," the article reads "for the United 8tates to have ? la the country an ample supply of gsod cavalry horses. Indeed, the lack of such animals would prove disastrous In war. The remouat service of the Quartermaster Corps hss started Its breeding scheme In time 19 ?onaerve me supply ?na iv improve Its quality. It is being' helped in this work by the American Remount and other associations, by clubs and public-spirited citlsens, who realise the great importance of the work." * Preach Gratitude. Another evidence of Franco-American friendship and cordial co-operation between the French army and the United States graves registration service in France is the following letr ter. received by the quartermaster general from Gen. Nudant. commanding the 7th Corps, which reads as follows: "I wish to assure you that every Frenchman will learn with gratitude that you intend flying the French colors by the side of the American flag on Ail Saints day. It will be to us a solemn and glorious thought that on that day. the i?nory of the brotharaia-urma who died for the defenaa of ?-? I Mavy News CB G. DrSCAS. j right. will be united in our minds; the reverent gathering that will stop with a feeling of respect and gratitude before the graves of the noble sons of America, fallen on French soil, will see with deep emotion the two.flags flying together, symbol of FrancoAmerican friendship." Remount Activities. In combining horse breeding with agriculture in a peaceful valley of the leuowstone?once notea ior us om?born resistance against hostile Indians ? the War Department now maintains one of its largest remount depots, namely. Fort Keogh, Mont. The land comprises some 60.000 acres, upon which soil rich grasses grow and horses thrive. This reservation is under the direct charge of Lieut. Col. Henry GibKons. The budget for next year, when approved, will enable the first steps to be taken toward permanent agricultural development of this land, under a system of intensive irrigation. While the amount of hay and grain now produced does not meet the Army's demand, it establishes a valuable medium through which a large amount of feed is available each year. Communications from all parts of the country continue to pour In to the military committees of the Senate and House from emergency officers who, were injured on duty during the war. asking that they be granted the same pay as officers of the Regular Army who were retired for illness or disability. Now that the Navy is likely to accede to a similar request, emergency officers of the Army believe !h*t their claims will be granted. The ordnance department is conducting a series of experiments look-| ing to the development of caliber .30 armor-piercing ammunition with still greater penetration than the present type. Steps have been taken by the quartermaster general for the establishment at the remount department. Camp Dix, N. J., of a training school for officers. It is proposed to send all captains and lieutenants on duty in the remount service to this school for a basic course, the first class, not to exceed ten officers, to start about January 1, 1921. Members of the military and naval forces of the nation were pleased to note the sympathy and interest of President Wilson, expressed In his message to Congress, when he appealed for more adequate facilities in the eare and treatment of former members of the service who are now sick ?r disabled. \ THE 

NAVY t > ? Each of the electrically-driven batle cruisers, of which six are in course >f construction, will, according to tear Admiral R. S.

'he amount used to operate the cruisrs would operate fifty large merchant ships. This power, said the adltral, will represent the greatest lorsepower per shaft that has ever een projected in any marine intallatlon. Irrespective of the type of lotive power. In the case of two f our battleships, the installations epresent an increase of'60.000-horse-. over, or double the most powerful lectrie drive previously designed, 'his, said the admiral, means making the United States pre-emlent 'among all nations in marine ngineerlng."
