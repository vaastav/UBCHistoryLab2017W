The bill was passed without divi sion. 

READY FOR WAR. Our Army and Navy Prepared if Japan Wants to Fieht. Washintgon, Dec. 4. Nothing which has been said in the whole range of comment on the possibility of war be tween the United States and Japan has surprised certain Washington officials so much as t he seeming unanimity of opinion in the country that we are ut terly unprepared for a tight with the Orientals. There is a prayerful hope that no war will come, but, if it should come, the strong probabilities are that the pessi mists, and they seem to abound in every section of the land, will find that they have looked upon the prospect with blue glasses. Congressmen have come into Wash intgon fmm every district and all of them seem burdened with the belief that, if trouble comes with Japan over the California school question which is a minor matter or over the enact ment of a Japanese exclusion law which is a major matter the Philip- pines will be lost to us, temporarily it least, within a month The Japanese will not take the Phil ippines, fir, if they do, they will be suc cessful in an exploit that will bring them such honors of war as few people.

FROM PRESIDENT'S VIEW. Gives Reasons for Dismissing Former Ambassador Storer. Washington, Dec. 11. President Roosevelt tonight made public a long letter addressed to Secretary Root, giv ing correspondence between the presi dent and ex-Ambassador Bellamy Stor er, in which lie says that Mr. Storer's refusal to answer his letters and the publication of various private letters justified the ambassador's removal; that Mr. Storer's publication of private correspondence was peculiarly ungentle manly and that he (the president) had stated with absolute clearness his posi tion, the reason why it was out of the (piestion for him as president to try to get any archbishop made cardinal, though expressing his admiration fur Archbishop Ireland as well as leaders of other denomination. The president's action follows the publication of a "confidential pamph let" which Mr. Storer last week sent to the president, the cabinet anil the sen ate and foreign relations committee.

Eugene The Willamette valley car shortage is seriously affecting the busi ness of Lane county lumber concerns. The Booth-Kelly company's big mill at Wend ling has closed down on that ac count, forcing between 250 and 400 men into idleness. The company's Springfield mill is running only in the day time, the night shift having been laid off several months ago, forcing 100 men to seek employment elsewhere. The company at the present time is short 1 , 7(H) cars, and it is estimated that the total shortage in the county is 3, OW cars. The Mohawk Lumber com pany's mill has closed down. Brownsville Feels Gloomy. Brownsville Inability to obtain cars for transportation of lumber is jmralyz ing the business of the lumbermen of this section. The shortage has existed for seven weeks, during which period not a single car lias been loaded at this station, the railroad company absolute ly refusing to supply cars at all. That no relief is in sight is jvitent from the fact that a conference, held in Portland a few days ago, between Mayor W. P. Elmore, of this city, and J. P. O'Brien, of the Southern Pacific, in reference to the car shortage, failed utterly, no encouragement whatever being offered. Linn Needs 50 for Grain. Albany There is great suffering from the car shortage in towns on the branch lines in this part of the state. Being a railroad junction and a distri buting point, Albany is more favored than any other valley city, but condi tions even here are very bad. Shippers can get cars for Portland, but absolute ly nothing for the south. The greatest need is for cars for grain and farm pro duce on branch lines. Shippers are un able to fill orders, and the demand for cars is growing greater every day. At least 50 cars are needed now for grain alone. ' Inconvenience at Grants Pass.

EVERY COUNTY PAID IN FULL. Oregon is Out of Debt, and Will Be Until Early Next Year. Salem For the first time in the his tory of the state every county has paid its state taxes in full. In the last three or four years the payments have been prompt and only two or three counties were delinquent and only for eomjiaratively small sums. Now, how ever, that the last half of the state tax from the several counties is delinquent, a balance of accounts has been struck and not a dollar is found to be due the state. Until a few days ago fine county had not paid, but the county treasurer remitted before delinquency started the accumulation of interest. Though the finances of the state are in excellent condition and the state has not a dollar of debt, it is apjiarent that the treasury will be depleted early in 1!)07, and that for some time warrants must be indorsed for want of funds and the state must pay interest thereon. No more state taxes will be due until April. Corn in Benton County. Corvallis On old wheat land in this county, John Whitakcr, living 12 miles south of Corvallis, grew this swi.son 1, XHj bushels of corn on 14 acres of ground. The yield is more than 70 bushels per acre, which is understood to be a satisfactory yield in the corn belt of the Middle West. The soil is sandy loam, but has been cropped for many years to wheat. The success Mr. Whitaker has had this and other years will lead him to plant a larger acreage of corn next season. Will Colonize Big Tract. Oregon City Judge T. F. Ryan has made the sale for II. Grim, of Texas, of 800 acres of land, four miles north east of Molalla, U W. II. Pair, of Can by. This farm will be subdivided into small tracts and disposed of through a plan of colonization. Only 80 acres of the large tract are under cultivation, but the rest can easily be cleared by the individual purchaseas of the tracts. The land is rich and productive and is one of the most fertile sections in the county. Can Factory for Astoria. Astoria Articles of incorporation of the Kendall Can company have been filed in the county clerk's oflice. The incorporators are George W. Sanborn, F. P. Kendall and G. C.

Washington, Dec. 10. An investi gation of the operations ai d manage ment of the railroads coi.tr died by James J. Hill and associates, including the North'-m Pacific, Great Northern and Chicago, Burlington & Quincy is in conternplatif n by the Interstate Commerce commission. After certain preliminaries have been arranged and counsel for the commission selected, formal announcement of the proposed inquiry will be made. As in the case of tl e proposed inves tigation of the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railroads of the Ilarriman sy.-tem, the inquiry is not the outgrowth of any specific complaints of violations of the interstate commerce law, but it is to be undertaken by virtue of the general inquisitorial powers conferred upon the commission by congress. The inquiry will lie broad and com prehensive, with a view to ascertaining the exact condition of affairs regarding the jailroad's compliance with the in terstate commerce act. A member of the commission, in speaking of the pro posed inquiry, said: "Although there has been outward, compliance with the decree of the Su preme court in dissolving the Northern Securities company, yet there has been n difference in the rates given upon the united system." WOULD WELCOME CITIZENSHIP. Viscount Aoki Says Japanese Are Eager for Naturalization. Washington, Dec. 10. Favorable ac tion by congress on the recommendation of the president in his last annual mes sage that an act be passed specifically providing for the naturalization of Jap anese who come to the L'nited States intending to become American citizens, will go far toward securing a continu ance of the traditional friendly rela tions between this country and Japan, is the opinion Jof Viscount Aoki, the Japanese ambassador. "Of course," said Viscount Aoki, to day, "no nation likes to see its subjects leave to take up a permanent abode in a foreign land and lose all relation with the fatherland, but in many cases it cannot be helped." The ambassador expressed the belief that there were not so many Japanese in this country to take advantage of naturalization if it were granted, but he thought that such an opportunity should he afforded them along with the citizens of other countries. He said he did not think it probable that those Japanese who were emigrating in large numlier to Hawaii and the Pacific coast would aail themselves of natur alization, because of the fact that they represented the poorer classes, and most of them ultimately returned to Japan. Viscount Aoki said he had every confidence in the outcome of the test case which will be brought in the California courts. FIX 

LUMBER PRICE. Senate May Inves.igate Manufactur ers Who Control Industry. Washington, Dec, 10. An investiga tion of the lumber combine, as pro posed in the resolution introduced by Senator Kittredge, of South Dakota, will lie productive of more good to the people, in the opinion of some Western senators, than any inquiry instituted in recent years. Mr. Kittredge has collected considerable material, and, when it is presented to the senate in connection with details Senator LaFol lette and other Western senators will bring fait, a strong majority is expect ed in favor of the resolution. In many respects the "gentlemen's agreement which controls the price of lumlier is like that which was alleged in the lieef packing industry. There are several associations, such as the Hemlock association, the Pine associa tion and the Hardwood association, whose representatives meet once a month, discuss the conaitions and fix price-:. There are no records and no docu ments that would nici limnate, but tl r nigh an agreement of "gentlemen" th output is regulated and prices fixed. East River Tunnel Bores Joined, New York, Dec. 10.
