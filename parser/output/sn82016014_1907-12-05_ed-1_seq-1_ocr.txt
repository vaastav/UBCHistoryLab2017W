I I BANK IS CLOSED. National Bank of Commerce' of Kansas City Fails to Open. It Is In Hands of Bank Ex aminer James T. Bradley. IT HAS BEEN SHAKY Since Its Statement Was Issued August 22 Last. Deposits Have Fallen Off Nearly One-Half Since Then. Failnre Is Followed by Sus pension of Several Branches. Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 6. The Na tional Bank of Commerce of Kansas City, Mo., one of the largest In the west with "deposits of 16 millions, closed its doors this morning and was taken in charge by a national bank examiner on an order of the comptrol ler of currency. Later two small out lying banks in which the Commerce was Interested, the Stock Yards Bank of Commerce and the Union Avenue Bank of Commerce, also closed. The failure of these banks had been predicted for several days and but lit tle excitement followed the announce ment of the news, although crowds of depositors gathered about the doors of these institutions. The officials of the Commerce, which Is affiliated with many banks here and in other parts of the southwest, express the belief that none of them will be seriously af fected. The failure is laid to the withdrawal by outside banks within the past two months of eighteen mil lion dollars of deposits. They expect to reopen soon and say depositors will be paid in full. Other local banks were not serious ly affected up to noon, and at several banks heavy deposits were made. The following statement was Issued at noon by Dr. W. S. "Woods, president of the National Bank of Commerce, for the board of directors: Statement of the Directors. "To the Public: Much as we regret to do so we are compelled to close the doors of the National Bank of Com merce because we have not been ablo to collect money from our borrowers as fast as the same was demanded by .our depositors, caused by unjust and unfounded rumors, vigorously circu lated. "Durine this panic, we have re duced our deposits from 35 million dollars to about 16 million, dollars. thus paying out over the counter and by transfers to other banks in this city and other cities about 18 million -dol lars of deposits. This of itself tells of our resources. We have made the fight of our life, but could not stand the strong- tide against us. "We nope to be able to open the bank again in the near future for business. We do not believe it pos sible for a depositor In the National Bank of Commerce to lose a dollar. We beg your indulgence and forbear ance until our affairs can be arranged to the satisfaction of all Interested parties. We appreciate sensibly the confidence our numerous customers, large and small, have placed In us, and we hope to show in the end that we have been true to tnis trust." The following notice was pasted on the door of the bank at 8:30 this mora ine "This bank has been closed by order of the board of directors. It is in the hands of James T. Bradley, national bank examiner, by order of the comp troller of currency. The bank had been In a weakened condition since its last statement which was issued August 22 last. At that time It was stated the bank owed the clear ing house close to a million aoiiars. When the financial disturbance came and the clearing house decided to issue clearing house checks, rumors regard ing the Commerce's condition increas ed until within the ipast few days num erous conferences of other national banking officials were held and means of keeping the bank open were dis cussed. It Did Not Respond. Yesterday much surprise was ex pressed when the request of the comp troller for a statement of condition of banks was not responded to by the Na tional Bank of Commerce. Other local banks published their statements show ing a healthy condition, but the offi cials of the Commerce announced that Its statement would not be forthcom ing until this morning. This created further distrust in the bank's condition and after conferences lasting Into the early hours this morning, the clearing house officials decided they could not aid the falling bank. When the statement of the national Bank of Commerce appeared In the morning papers It showed that since the abatement of Ausrust 22. last, the de posits had been reduced from close to 35 millions of dollars to $16,942,694. The statement showed, also, that the item of loans and discounts had been cut down 4 millions of dollars. The state ment issued this morning follows: Statement.

S. Woods, president; W. H. Win ants, vice president, and William A. Rule, cashier. Its directors and stock holders Include some of the most prominent men in Kansas City. Dr. Woods is also president of the Com merce Trust company of Kansas City, which has a capital of $1,000,000 and deposits of $1,395,969. A Run Was Prevented. Since its last statement the de posits of the trust company have in creased nearly $200,000 and that In stitution Is believed to be in a sound condition. James F. Downing, presi dent of the New England National bank and head of the local Clearing House association, expressed the be lief that the failure of the Commerce would not involve deeply any other Kansas City institution and that other local banks would be able to' weather the storm. The National Bank o Commerce held the deposits of numer ous small banks in this part - of the southwest. . What effect the failure will have upon them is problematical. On August 22, last, the Commerce owed other national banks $13,299,450 and state banks and bankers, $9,819, 495. There had been no run by local depositors, but many of the outside banks caused trouble by withdrawing their funds on deposit with the Com merce. . The National Bank of Commerce was a United States depository and the August statement showed these items among its liabilities: United States deposits, $227,913; deposits of United States disbursing officers. $52, 086. The Bank of Commerce was inter ested in many local enterprises. Its individual depositors were among the largest of any bank in the city. Its statement printed this morning show ing the heavy falling off in deposits drew a big crowd of depositors to the bank as early as 9 o'clock, evidently intent upon withdrawing their money. More or less excitement followed the news that the bank had been closed ana the crowd gradually grew In size until It stopped traffic. Statement of Cashier. William A. Rule, cashier of the bank, made the following statement this morning, in the presence of Dr. W. S. Woods, the president: "The directors of the National Bank of Commerce thought It was best to at least close temporarily. We made the fight of our lives, but conditions were against us. The depositors will not lose a cent." Dr. Woods acquiesced in what Cashier Rule had said and added: "You may also say that the Com merce Trust company is absolutely all right. Yesterday its statement show ed 60 per cent of its cash on hand." James T. Bradley, of Sedan, Kan., national bank examiner, said: "I have taken charge of the Bank of Commerce, and following the policy of the administration and doing my duty as bank examiner, I shall make every effort to set the bank on its feet. I have not been able to investigate mat ters as yet. I can not say definitely when the bank will re-open." James F. Downing, president of the clearing house, said: "Up to yesterday the Bank of Com merce owed the clearing house $300,000. This account was settled, but it was out of the question to furnish aid to the bank. I consider the failure due to lack of conservatism. None of the oth er banks here has found it necessary to ask aid of the clearing house and I consider them to be perfectly sound. The Commerce failure will not affect them." ! History of the Bank. A new home for the bank, being erected by Jarvis Hunt, the New York architect at a cost of $1,500,000, is Jusf Bearing completion. The Com merce was to have moved into the building within a few months and re cently had let contracts for expensive furnishings. One contract was for $25,000 worth of specially designed furniture, let to a Boston firm. The National Bank of Commerce was the outgrowth of the Kansas City Sav ings association, organized in 1865, with a capital of $100,000. In 1882, the asso ciation was reorganized as the Nation al Bank of Commerce with a capital of $200,000. In 1887, the capital was in creased to $1,000,000. In 1897. the Bank of Commerce took over the business of the Midland National bank, and the Metropolitan National bank of Kansas City. In June, 1901, the City National the result of the Kansas City suspen of New York citv. was said to have sion on the Institutions in this citv as made an offer to buy a majority of the stock of the Bank of Commerce, but it was refused. Dr. W. S. Woods, president, and Wil liam A. Rule, cashier, have both been connected with the bank for many years. Dr. Woods has been interested in many enterprises. In his early career he practiced medicine in Paris, Mo-; later he established a wholesale grocery business at the terminal of the Union Pacific railway, moving it westward with the building of the road, until he had reached Salt Lake City. In 1869 he established the Rocheport Savings bank at Rocheport, Mo. He came to Kansas City in 1880. For a time he was a member of the wholesale dry goods firm of Grimes, Woods, LaForce & Co., about the same time he engaged in the cattle business in the Black Hills with his brother, James M. Woods, and sup plied the government with beef for the forts and Indians in the north. He is a stockholder in numerous con cerns. William A. Rule came here from St. Louis. ComptroUer's Statement. Washington, Dec. 5. The comptroller of the currency today issued the follow ing statement regarding the failure of the National Bank of Commerce of Kansas City: "The comptroller's office has been ad vised that the officers and directors of the National Bank of Commerce of Kansas City, Missouri, decided not to open its doors today and requested the national bank examiner to take charge until their assets could be realized on, when there is strong hope that the bank may be able to resume. This bank is one of the largest in the west and in September last had about 34 millions in deposits. Some thing like twenty-two millions of this was due to other banks. The failure Is doubtless due to calls which have been, made on the National Bank of Com-' merce for these banking balances and their Inability to realize on their assets quickly enough to meet them. "It is too early for the comptroller's office to give any details of the failure, but it is hoped that the bank will be found solvent, so the depositors can be paid in full, If the bank is not able to resume." Jar8 Wall Street. New York, Dec. 5. The New York correspondent of the National Bank of Commerce of Kansas City is the First National bank. An official of that In stitution said today that the Kansas City concern had a large credit bal ance with the First National. The stock market was affected by the news of the failure, but not to a serious ex tent. TWO 

BRANCHES CLOSED. Failure of Kansas City Banks Failed to Start Any Rons. Kansas City, Dec. 5. Two small branches of the National Bank of Com merce, one located at the Union Stock Yards and the other in the wholesale district in the west bottoms, also closed their doors during the morning. They (Continued on Page Ten.) DOES NOT HURT. Kansas City Failure Isn't Felt in Topeka. No Local Banks Hare Deposits There. Large USEH FOR COLLECTION Aggregate Amounts to Only a Few Thousand. Topeka Institutions Allin Ex cellent Condition. Statements of All of Them Published Today. There is no doubt that the Topeka banks are in better condition today than they were when the clearing nouse rule was adopted on the 28 th of October, as their statements pub lished today prove. Some deposits nave been withdrawn, but they are the small accounts which belong to pepole who are always the first to take alarm at any unusual condition in the banking world on account of their lack of knowledge of financial mat ters. There seems to be no disposition on the part of the depositors In Topeka banks to become panic-stricken and the business of the banks today 13 normal. The statements published today show that the banks In this city are in excellent shape and that there is an abundance of currency on hands for the purpose of. actual business transactions. The news of the suspension of the National Bank of Commerce of Kan sas City was received in banking cir cles in Topeka early this morning through numerous private telegrams and telephone messages and caused but little surprise and no excitement. There seems to have been a well de fined opinion in banking circles in To peka for some time past that the in stitution was not in the best condition to withstand the strain brought upon it by the financial conditions which have existed since the adoption of the clearing house rule the latter part of October. The National Bank of Commerce of Kansas City was used by the banks of Topeka as a collection agency rather than as a depository and the loss to Topeka bankers will not amount to more than a few thousand dollars at the most. The Topeka banks which have carried small deposits in the Kansas City institution in the : past have used the financial flurry as an excuse . for withdrawing their funds and the bank examiner will find at least one Topeka bank whioh is a creditor of the Kansas City institution, though the sum- involved amounts to but a few hundred dollars; a collec tion made late yesterday. All In Cheerful Mood. The bankers of Topeka are not averse to discussing the suspension of the Kansas City institution. . They are a unit in their opinion that the closing of the bank will in no way affect - the banking interests In this city. J. R. Mulvane, president of the Bank of To- peka, said: There is no reason for a feeling of concern among Topeka bankers as to far as I can see. "None of the banks in this city were depositors to any great extent and at most, the money tied up by the suspen sion will amount to but a few thousand dollars, not a drop in the bucket when compared to the resources of the banks in Topeka. For that matter the total of all of the deposits from TOpeka banks could be charged off as a total loss and it would not be felt, though it is my opinion that the Institution is solvent and will In time pay out. "It is natural that we should get our outstanding reserve in our own banks as fast as possible and that is Just what we have been doing for the past month and the result is that our reserve in Kansas City Is at a very low point- As far as I can see there has not been a particle of excitement about the city today since the suspension has been generally known. The Kansas City bank has been used more as a collection agency by bankers of Topeka for some time rather than a bank of deposit and this In a large measure accounts for the small reserves carried there at this time." F. W. Freeman, vice president of the Merchants' National bank, said: "Thens is hardly a possibility that the Kansas City suspension will affect banking in Topeka in any way. As I understand the situation the banks in tnis city which have carried deposits in the Kan sas City institution have withdrawn the larger amount of them and the loss will be" light If any at all. The enor mous liquidations maae Dy me mm. of Commerce during the past 40 days indicate thaU its assets are good and the loss will in all probabilities be small." Expected the Failure. C. W. Snyder, president of the To peka State bank, said: "Topeka has hwn fortunate in this failure and if any ui ilo uw.i"b y " l ai an me i"s " , ""r 'i ; won li meni-iuiuus. iubi o ua. heard rumors which have been afloat for some time and those who had de posits in the institution have governed themselves accordingly." William Macferran, cashier of the State Savings bank said: "There is hut little money belonging to Topeka banks in the Bank of Commerce which suspended payment this morning and it is my opinion that it will not be lost and that the unfortunate affair is a suspension and not a failure. In my opinion this is another instance of where a bank was talked to death by its enemies and I feel that its assets will enable the bank examiner to pay off all claims in full, in time." Edwin Knowles, president of the Capital National bank said: "The sus pension of the Kansas City institution has been anticipated by the bankers of this city for some time and all who were interested have taken measures to protect themselves. For instance our statement shows that we have $152 on deposit in the Bank of Commerce, though under ' -ordinary circumstances our deiposits In the institution would have amounted to thousands of dollars In the place of only a little more than a hundred dollars."

GOVERNMENT1 INSPECTION. Trackmen Favor Such Action on the Various Railroad. " Fort Scott, Kan., Dec. 6. The con vention of the National Union of Rail way Trackmen which body has been in session since Monday, has adjourn ed. . The resolution committee, of which P. S. Titler of Gallltzen, Pa., is chair man, submitted its report late yester day afternoon. The report embodies a strong plea that laws be enacted In the various states providing for a gov ernment inspector: of railroad tracks. This resolution was adopted enthusi astically by the convention. Yesterday the delegates or 35 of of them walked the Missouri Pacific track near Marmaton and also at Rich Hill and found the roadbed to be in a very unsafe condition. Rotten ties were found in many places by the explorers. AS OTHERS SEE US. Japanese Official Describes Conditions In the United States. Tokio, Dec. 5. Kikl Yiro Ishli, chief of the Japanese bureau of commerce, who a few days ago returned from his visit to the United States and Canada, where he was sent to investigate the emigration problem, gathered represen tatives of the Tokio newspapers around him at the foreign office this evening and made a statement regarding his mission abroad. He said that there were two classes of Japanese in Amer ica, day laborers, of whom there were 15,000, and agriculturists. It was against the immigration of the former that objection was raised. He had found that many of this class were de sired by employers, but others said their methods of living -were objection able. The Japanese agriculturists gen erally were successful. Baron Ishli de scribed the existing economic condi tions in America and explained the method of state self-government in the United States. He said that between the trusts and the labor unions the middle class of Americans and foreign laborers suffered, declaring that union labor was largely controlled by unrea soning persons, their attitude being almost that of tyrants, and they were liable to destroy anything standing in their way. - "Japanese engaged In agriculture as land owners or leasers," said Baron Ishil, "require a few of the best class of their countrymen as laborers, but the government of Japan has been lim iting the emigration of this class." A committee from the emigration agencies here has held a conference with Minister of Foreign Affairs Haya shi, who announced that the plan of the Japanese government was closely limiting all emigration to the United States and Canada. Some members of the committee angrily announced their 1 opposition to this course, but Minister Hayashi remained and this dismissed the committee without changing his at titude and making no compromise. FOR A CLOSER TIL Government and Trade Interests Hold a Conference. Washington, Dec 5. To . effect a closer tie between the department of commerce and labor and the commer cial bodies of the country, a confer ence was held today in the office of Secretary Straus. Besides Secretary Root and Secretary Straus who initiated the movement for the con ference there were present delegates from chambers of commerce, boards of trade and other organizations from New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Den ver, Galveston, Portland, Seattle and San Francisco and other cities. To day's meeting was, of a preliminary nature and its purpose is regarded by its promoters as administrative as dis tinguished from legislative. Tariff, reciprocity and matters of finance were debarred as not within the scope of the department. .; The formation of a permanent ad visory council representing the com mercial bodies of the country is re garded as a probable result of the conference and it is suggested that the co-operation of the council might ex tend to other departments of the gov ernment that come in close touch with the commercial interests of the country. Today's program included opening statements by Secretaries Root and Straus and a reception by the president. 

FUNSTON IS READY. Can Throw 1,000 Men Into Goldlield on Short Notice. San Francisco, Dec. 5. Brigadier General Funston said today that he Is in receipt of a confidential report from Goldfield on the situation there. Everything was in readiness to for ward troops without delay. If troops were sent they would probably be 1,000 in number, includ ing the Twentieth and Twenty-flr.st infantry regiments. President Issues an Order. Washington, Dec. 5. President Roosevelt has Issued orders to have in restoring order at Uoldneld, Nev. This action was taken upon repre- sentation from Governor Sparks of that state that the miners at Goldfield are in revolt and riot. Nevada is the one state in the Union which has no state militia. Governor Sparks does not deem the situation such as to Justify immediate federal interference but as one likely at any time to get beyond his ability to control. The nearest federal military base Is at San Francisco.

Government During the Fiscal Tear Recently Closed Redeemed Enough Bonds to Off set the Panama Canal Issue. ' CORTELYOU'S REPORT Of the Treasury Transactions Submitted to Congress. Stock of Money Increased $180, 584,416 Last Tear. . Washington, Dec. 6. The annual report of the secretary -of the treas ury was submitted to congress today. Following is a summary of the opera tions of the department for the past fiscal year: The most noticeable transactions of the treasury during the past fiscal year have been the dealings with de positary banks and the manner of dis posing of accumulating revenues. For the first quarter the excess of ordi nary revenues over expenditures, the deposit of lawful money in excess of national bank notes redeemed, to gethpr with the proceeds of the Pana ma canal bond sale, amounted to $40, 020,671.22, which was restored to the channels of trade by direct deooslts in national banks aggregating $42, 986,700.90, increasing the balance therein to $124,088,475.42 by October 1. For the second quarter the net ex cess from the first two sources pre viously named was $20,238,089, while the balance in depositary, banks to the credit of the general fund had grown to $146,827,867.99 by January 1, an increase of $22,739,392.57 since Octo ber 1. The treasury also purchased $2,441,260 principal of the interest bearing debt. For the third quarter the excess from the - two sources named amounted to $28,649,480.14, of which $7,265,094,10 was deposited in national banks, increasing the bal ance therein to $154,092,962,09 by April. The treasury also purchased and redeemed $14,484,220 principal of the Interest-bearing debt. For the fourth quarter the net excess from the two sources named amounted to $34, 271,285.86, of which $12,961,817.03 was deposited in national banks, in creasing the balance therein to $167, 054,779.12 by July 1, and the treasury redeemed $13,399,380 principal of the interest-bearing debt. In the mean time (April 2,) the residue of the 4 per cent loan of 1907, about $36,000, 000, after refunding operations were completed, was called for redemption, Interest on same to cease on July 2, 1907-and in order to provide for -the payment thereof, a call was made upon the depositary ' banks June 12 for the return, by July 10, "of $30, 000,000 of the public moneys held by them. Under the provisions of the act of March 14, 1900, $50,307,800 in United States bonds of the loan of 1907 were received during the last fiscal year, at a valuation equal to their present worth, to yield an income of 24 per cent per annum, and a like amount of consols of 1930 were Issued in exchange therefor at a premium of 3 per cent. The addition of $30,000,000 in bonds of the Panama Canal loan to the interest bearing debt during the past fiscal year was more than offset by the purchase and net redemption of $30,324,860 In bonds of the loan of 1907, and refund ing certificates. The noninterest-bear-ing debt was increased $4,980,082.50. The net increase of the debt proper was $4,655,222.50- The Trust Funds. The trust funds consisting of gold coin and standard silver dollars, held for the redemption of certificates and notes for which they are respectively pledged, tmounted to $1,160,009,869 at the close of the last fiscal year, an In crease of $115,371,100 as compared with that of 1906. The monetary stock of the country increased $180,584,416 during the last fiscal year. The growth in gold was $125,682,336, in silver $13,623,750, and in national bank notes $42,676,330, while there was a decrease of $1,398,000- in treasury notes of 1890. At the close of the fiscal year 1907 the money in circu lation amounted to. $2,772,956,455,- or a per capita of $32.22. The percentage of gold to total circulation was 41.90. The notes and certificates of United States paper currency issued during the past fiscal year numbered 173,093911 pieces of the total value of $698,273,000. The redemptions were 161,434,830 pieces of the value of $582,902,000.

The average, cost of each piece of United States pap'er currency issued and redeemed was 1.971 cents, and the annual cost of maintenance of the cur rency issued by- the national govern ment averages about one-fifth of 1 per cent of the amount outstanding. There was an Increase of $42,676,330 in the volume of national bank notes during the past fiscal year, but the amount presented for redemption was only $240,314,681, as against $296,292,885 in 1906. The expenses incurred for such redemptions were $233,650.52, which have been assessed on the banks at the rate of $0.98615 per $1,000 of notes redeemed. The act of March 4, 1907, met a long existing need. It enlarged the resources of the treasury for the issue of paper currency in the smaller denominations. The issue of $5 United States notes and $10 gold certificates began on July 1, and the demands for notes and certifi cates of the smaller denominations have been supplied as rapidly as possible since that date. Bonds to Secure Circulation. The United States bonds pledged to secure bank circulation amounted to $558,364,660 on June 29, 1907, an increase of $37,759,450 during the fiscal year.

The redemptions from the reserve fund during the last fiscal year were, in United States notes $12,690,887, in treasury notes $101,278, making total of $12,792,165. The redeemed notes were restored to the general fund in exchange for gold, and the reserve thereby maintained . at ths fixed amount. On June 30. 1906. there were 77 001,368 silver dollars in circulation: the number distributed at government expense for transportation during the last fiscal year was 37,500,118, but tna number In circulation on June 29, 1907, was only 81,710,444. The accu mulation of this coin In the treasury is not in excess of the amount that can be used in the rezular transactions of the treasury offices. The amount of subsidiary silver shipped at govern ment expense for transportation was $30,895,662.55. The average rate for transportation was $2.40 per $1,000. The available cash balance in the general fund at the close of the fiscal year 1907 was $272,061,445.47, an in crease of $91,372,090.65 as compared with that of 1906. SAVEDllSLIFE. E. M. Whitlock Smothers Fire Consuming Four-Tear-Old Boy. Stanley Ridlon Had Been Flay' ing With Matches. R. M. Whitlock, a grocer of 1123 Kan sas avenue, by his presence of mind, probably saved the life of Stanley Rid lon, the four year old son of S. E. Rid' Ion of 1108 Quincy street though the child is seriously burned. The child was playing with matches under the front porch late Wednesday afternoon when his clothing . caught fire. As he crawled from his dangerous position his older brother saw him and noticed that his clothing was blazing He called to him but the frantic boy ran around the house with the brother in pursuit. Mr. Whitlock was passing in his wagon and his attention was at tracted by the child's screams. He then saw that the boy's clothing was burning. He grabbed a horse blanket and ran to the boy who was now wild with pain. Hastily wrapping the blan ket around the child he succeeded in putting out the fire. Doctors were called and the suffering of the little boy was somewhat relieved His legs and the lower portion of his body are terribly burned but the phy sicians say that unless complications ensue the child will recover-

The comp troller of the currency has issued a call for a statement of bank conditions at the close of business December 8. The call finds the Wichita banks in splendid condition. All the manks have excellent reserves. The wisdom of the course pursued by the banks is proven by tne tact mat ine amount or cur rency on hand in the Wichita banks is greater today thai It was when the crisis came live weeks ago. It is also declared that the last five weeks have constituted an extraordi nary period of liquidation, which has naturally reduced the deposit balances.

Bryan, en route to his home In Lincoln, Neb., arrived here from Washington, and met his wife and daughter, who are bound for New York, whence they will sail for Europe Saturday. . Mr. Bryan commented on several of the Issues treated in President Roosevelt's message and credited the president with introducing an original proposition in suggesting the appro priation - of campaign funds . by the government. "I hope," he said, "that It will be enacted into a -law." Mr. Bryan is strictly in accord with the president concerning postal sav ings banks and guaranteed banks. Said he: "The- money hoarded in hiding places, if it can be drawn into the banks and thus be- put into channels of trade, will relieve the stringency more effectively than anything else. The postal banks will do this to a limited extent, but not completely, for in the plan proposed the depositors will be limited as to each person and no checking accounts will be allowed. "The system of the guaranteed banks contemplates the absolute guarantee by the government of such banks as may voluntarily enter into the system. In entering the system they agree to reimburse the govern ment in proportion to their deposits for any losses incurred by the gov ernment in payment of depositors in failed banks. During the last 40 years, the average loss among na tional banks has been less than 1-10 of one per cent of deposits, and, as we have passed through two panics in that time, it is not likely -that the average loss will be greater during the next 40 years. . "To sum up the depositors need security and this must either be given by the postal savings bank, which will grow until it has absorbed the banking of the country or it must be furnished through the guarantee of existing banko." 

REBOUNUJS HERE. Signs of Business Depression Rapidly Disappearing. New England Manufactories Are Resuming Operations. ON FIRM GROUND NOW. E. B. . Barriman Says There Will Be No Falling Back. Be Sees the Dawn of a New Era of Prosperity. . Boston, Dec. 6. Signs of recovery from business depression which started several weeks ago are being felt in all parts of New England by the resuming of operations in the mills which were shut down or which shortened their working hours, and in the lessened numbering of curtailments and closing. The Saranao Glove company of Lit tleton, N. H., after a shut down of twa weeks, resumed operations on full tlm today, and the QuinaDoact mills at Quinapoact also started operations on full time after a ten days' shut down. The management of the Whitney Box company of Leominster report a larger nubmer of orders than for some months but have had to lay off a few men be cause of shortage in stock. The Isaac Prouty company's shoe factories employing 1,500 hands, when running on normal time, are expected to be operating again on full time next week. Harrlman Optimism. New York. Dec. 5. That the country is already beginning to recover from the severe shock received in the recent panic is the opinion of E. H- Harrlman ' as expressed in an Interview published nere today. "We are in the rebound from the de pression and we are in it to stay," Mr. Harrlman said. 'There will be no falling baok. Each step that we are taking is firm. Under neath the whole situation there is in dustrial stability. There is too much work to be done and too great capacity for doing it to allow a long drawn out depression. There are indications ev erywhere that confidence is being re stored. The country is too big and th people too sensible to allow tjie acts ol a few men to shake their faith in th Integrity of our great financiers am' business men as a whole. 'Yesterday there was a little scare at first, but when the people saw thai there were rotten spots only here anc there they quickly recovered from theii fright. "The dawn of a new era of prosperlts is here. The overstrain on cash is be ing relieved and credit is once mort being allowed to perform its normal work. But we must not expect at onct to see every line of commercial business . as active as it has been during the past two years. Perhaps it is better for th country that it should not be so. W( have a presidential campaign In front. It is only natural we should feel oui way cautiously for some time. When I say cautiously however I do not mear hesitatingly but rather conservatively."

Clark of Montana, -who w:if here in connection with his railroat interests, said: "I am sure the financial situation ii clearing very fast.

All these bankers agreei that the worst was over, and that casl payments could be Inaugurated ver; soon without trouble. "The total reduction In the output o- copper is so large that six months ough to see the surplus elimlnatea entireiy When that Is done I expect to see cop per go back to about 16 cents a poum and that is enough- At that figure con. sumption is possible on a large seal and while it will not permit all th mines to resume on the basis will still furnish employment for a large propor- tion of the men who have been tnrowr cut of employment by the receni elump." t
