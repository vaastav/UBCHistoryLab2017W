FENS/ON FRAUDS EXPOSED. Ko Subject So Important as Tariff Reform. SMALL INCOME TAX FAVORED. Washington. Dec. 4. — President Cleveland's annual message, which was read in congress soon after that body convened at noon for its fifty-third an nual session, is as follows: The constitutional duty which re quires the president from time to time to give to the congress information of the state of tte Union and recommend to their consideration such matters as he shall judge necessary is fittingly en tered upon by recemmending to the congress a careful examination of the detailed statements, and well supported recommendations contained in there ports of the heads of departments, who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the government. In an effort to abridge this communication as much as is consistent with its purpose, I shall supplement a brief reference to the con tents of these departmental reports by the mention of such executive business and incidents as are not embraced there in; and by such recommendations as ap pear to be at this particular time appro priate. 

FOREIGN AFFAIRS. Ko Embarrassing Relations With Other Countries. While our foreigu relations have not fit all timas during the past year been entirely free from perplexity, no embar rassing situations remain that will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love which characterizes a truly American foreign policy. My predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator of the long-standing missions boundary dispute, tendered to the president by the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys com missioned by those slates to lay before me evidence and arguments on behalf of their respective governments. 

BRAZIL. Uncle Sam's Navy Looking After Our Interests. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the republic of Brazil found the United States alert to watch the inter ests of our citizens in that country, with which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our new navy are now, and for some time have been, sta tioned at Rio de Janeiro, the struggle beiug between the established gover nment, whicii controls the machinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the ves sels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport; and lacking, as it does, the elements of divided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim recognition as belligerents. Thus far the position of our government has been that of an attentive, bnt impartial, observer of the unfortunate conflict. Emphasizing our fixed policy of impar tial neutrality in such a condition of af fairs as now exists, 1 deemed it neces sary to disavow, in a manner not to be misunderstood, the unauthorized action of a late naval commander In those waters in saluting the revolted Brazil ian admiral, being indisposed to counte nance an act calculated to give gratui tous sanction to the local insurrection. LITTLE CHILLI. Iran's Action Is Quietly Cen sured. **- The convention betweeu our govern ment and Chili, having for its object the settlement and the adjustment of the demands of the two countries against each other, has been made effective by the organization of the claims commis sion provided for. The two govern ments failing to agree upon the third member of the commission, the good offices of the president of the Swiss re public were invoked, as provided in the treaty, and the selection of ihe Swiss representative in this country to com plete the organization was gratifying to the United States and Chili. The vexatious question of so-called legation asylum for offenders against the state and its laws was presented anew in Chili by the unauthorized action of the late United States minis ter in receiving in his official residence two persons who had failed in an at tempt at revolution, and against whom criminal charges were pending, grow ing out of a former abortive disturb ance. The doctrine ot asylum, as applied to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedents, and, when allowed, tends to encourage sedition and strife. Under no circumstances can the representatives oj this government be permitted, under the ill-defined fiction of extraterritori ality, to interrupt the administra tion of criminal justice iv the countries to which they are accredited.

THE 

CHINESE. The Geary Law Was Met With Much Opposition. The legislation of last yeer; known as the Geary law, requiring the registra tion of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the United States, and the deportation of all -not complying with the provision of the act within the time prescribed, met with much opposition: from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon the advice of- eminent counsel that the law was unconstitutional, the great mass of Chinese laborers, pending, judicial inquiry as to its validity iii j good faith, declined to apply for the certificates required oy its provisions. A test, upon proceeding .- by habeas corpus, was brought before the supreme court, and on May 15, 1593, a decision was made by that tribunal sustaining tiie law. it is believed that, under the recent amendment .of the act, ex tending the time for registration, the Chinese laborers thereto entitled who desire to reside in this country will now avail themselves of the renewed priv ileges thus offered of establishing by lawful procedure their right to remain, and that thereby the necessity of en forced deportation may be to" a great degree avoided. lt has devolved upon the United States minister at Pekin, as dean of the diplo matic body, and in the absence of a rep resentative of Sweden and Norway, to press upon the Chinese government rep aration for the recent murder of Swed ish missionaries at Sung Pu. This ques tion is of vital interest to all countries whose citizens engage in missionary work in the interior. ZiffYz By article 12 of the general act of Brussels, signed July 2, 1890. for the BCPPRESSIOS OF THE SLAVE TISADE and the restriction of certain injurious commerce in the Independent States of the Congo and in the adjacent zone of Central Africa, the United States and other signatory powers agreed to adopt appropriate means for the punishment of persons selling arms and ammunition to the natives and for the confiscation of the Inhibited articles. It being the plain duty of this government to aid in suppressing the nefarious traffic, im pairing as it does the praiseworthy aud civilizing effort now in progress in that legion, 1 reccommend that an act be passed prohibiting the sale of arms and intoxicants to native iv the regulated done by our citizens. '--f-ff . THANKS FOR WEEKS. Costa Rica Did the Proper Act- Relations With Other Countries. Costa Rica has lately testified its friendliness >by surrendering to the United States, in the absence of a con vention of extradition, but upon duly submitted evidence of criminality, a noted fugitive from justice. It is trusted that the negotiation, of a treaty with that country to meet recurring cases of this kind will soon be accomplished. In my opinion, treaties for reciprocal ex tradition should be concluded with all those countries with which the United States has not already conventional ar rangements of that character. I have deemed it fitting to express to the gov ernments of Costa Rica and Colombia the kindly desire of the United States to see their pending boundary dispute finally closed by arbitration, in con formity with the spirit of the treaty concluded between them some years ago. ZZi Z-'-Z Our relations with the French republic continue to be intimate and cordial. I sincerely hope that the extradition treaty with that country, as ameuded by the senate, will soon be operative. While occasional questions affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the land of their birth have arisen in our in terviews with Germany, our relations with that country continue satisfactory. The questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress between the two govern ments with a view to such concurrent action as. will make the award and regu lations agreed upon by the Behring sea tribunal of arbitration practically* ef fective, and it is not doubted that Great Britain will co-operate freely with this counrry for the accomplishment of that purpose. The dispute growing out ot the documentary tolls imposed in the Welland caual upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States was adjusted by the sub stitution ofa more equitable schedule of charges, and my predecessor thereupon suspended his proclamation imposing discriminating tolls upon British transit through our canals. A request for ad ditions to the list of extraditable of fenses covered by the existing treaty between the two countries is under con sideration. . YYY CENTRAL AMERICA. Apology From Honduras—Nicara gua Canal— Affairs With Hayti. During the past year an American citizen, employed in a subordinate com mercial positiou in Hayti. after suffer ing a protracted imprisonment on an unfounded charge of smuggling, was finally liberated on judicial examina tion. Upon urgent representation to the Haytian government a Jsuita ble indemnity was paid to the sufferer. By a law of Hayti, a sailing vessel, having discharged her cargo, is refused clearance until the duties on such cargo have been paid. The hardship of this measure upon American ship owners, who conduct the bulk of the carrying trade of that country, has been insisted on with a view of securing the removal of this cause of complaint. Upon receiving authentic informa tion of the firing upon an American mail steamer touching at the port of Amapala tecause her captain refused to deliver up a passenger in transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon de mand of the military authorities of Hon duras, our minister to that oountry, un der instructions, protested against the wanton act and demanded satisfaction. The government of Honduras, actuated by a sense of justice, and in a spirit of the utmost friendship, promptly dis avowed the illegal conduct of its offi cers, and expressed sincere regret for the occurrence. It is confidently anticipated that a satisfactory adjustment will soon be reached of the questions arising out of the seizure and use of American vessels by iusurgents in Honduras and the sub sequent denial by the successful govern ment of commercial privileges to those vessels on that accouut. A notable part, the southeasterly coast of Liberia, between the Cavally and San Pedro rivers, which for nearly half a century has been generally recog nized as belonging to that republic by cession and purchases has been claimed to be under the protectorate of France in virtue of agreements entered into by the native tribes, over whom Liberia's control has not been well maintained. More recently negotiations between the Liberian representative and the French government resulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty whereby as an adjust ment certain Liberian territory is ceded to France. This convention at last ad vices had not been ratified by the Libe rian legislature aud executive. Feeling THE SAINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE: TUESDAY 2v_ORMNG.

The canal company . has unfortunately become j financially, seriously embar rassed, but generous treatment has.been . extended to it by the government of Nicaragua. The United States are : especially interested In the successful achievement of the vast undertaking this company has in charge. That it should be accomplished under dis tinctively American auspices, and its enjoyment assured not ouly to the ves sels of this country as a channel of com mercial communication between our Atlantic and Pacific seaboards, but to the ships of the world in the interests of civilization, is a proposition which, in my judgment, does not admit of ques tion. _-- Guatemala has also been visited by the political vicissitudes which have afflicted her Central American neigh bors; but the dissolution of its legis lature and the proclamation of a dicta torship have been unattended with civil war. *.?_." ~ An extradition treaty with Norway has recently been exchanged and pro claimed.

With Foreign Powers Commented Upon. Led by a desire to compromise differ ences and to contribute to the restora tion ot order in Samoa, which for some time previous had been the scene of conflicting foreign pretensions and na tive strife, the United States, depart ing from its policy consecrated by a century of observance, entered four years ago into the treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming jointly bound with England and Germany to establish and maintain Malietoa Laupepa as king of Samoa. The" treaty provided for a for eign court of justice; a municipal coun cil for the district of Apia, with a for eign president thereof, authorized to advise the king; a tribunal for the set tlement of native and foreign land titles, and a revenue system for the kingdom.' It entailed upon the three powers that part of the cost of the new government not met by the revenue of the islands. Early in the lite of this triple protecto rate the native dissensions It was de signed to quell revived. Rivals defied the authority of the new king, refusing to pay taxes and demanding the election of a ruler by native suffrage. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and a large number of his native adherents were in open rebellion on one of the islands. Quite lately, at the request of the other powers and in fulfillment of its treaty obligation, this government agreed to unite in a joint military move ment of such dimensions as would prob ably secure the surrender of the insur gents without bloodshed. The warship Philadelphia was accordingly put under orders . for . Samoa, but before she ar rived the threatened conflict was pre cipitated by King Malitoea's attack upou the insurgent camp. Mataafa was defeated and a number of men killed. The British and German naval vessels subsequently secured the surrender of Mataafa and his adherents. The de feated chief and ten of his principal supporters were deported to a German island of the Marshall group, where they are held as prisoners under the joint responsibility aud cost of the three powers.

SPANISH CLAIM. ' Complications With Turkey— The -Recent Revolution in Venezuela. More than fifteen years ago this gov ernment preferred a claim against Spain in behalf of one of our citizens for property seized and -'confiscated in Cuba. In 1886 the claim was adjusted, Spain agreeing to pay unconditionally as a fair indemnity 500,000. A re spectful but earnest note was recently addressed to the Spanish government, insisting upon prompt fulfillment of its long-neglected obligation. Other claims preferred by the United States against Spain in behalf of American citizens for property confiscated in Cuba have been pending for many years. At the time Spain's title to the Caroline isl ands was confirmed by arbitration, that government . agreed that the. rights which had been acquired there by American missionaries should be recog nized and respected. It is sincerely hoped that this pledge will be observed by allowing our missionaries, who were removed from Ponape to a place of safety by a United States warship dur ing the . late troubles between the Spainish garrison and the natives, to return to the field of usefulness. The reproduced caravel Santa Maria, built by Spain and sent to the Columbian ex position, has been presented to the United States in token of amity and In commemoration of the event it was de signed to celebrate. I recommend that in accepting this gift congress make grateful recognition of the sincere friendship which prompted it. f.z .. ..'. Imnertant matters nave demanded attention in our relations with the Otto man porte/ The firing and partial de struction by an unrestrained- mob of. one of the school buildings of tbe An ataly college established by the citizens of the United States at Marsovan, and the apparent indifference, of the Turk ish government to the outrage notwith standing the complicity of some of the officials, called for earnest . remon strance, which was followed by prom ises of reparation and punishment ot the offenders. Indemnity for the in jury to the buildings has already been paid, permission to rebuild given, regis tration of the school property in the American owners secured, and efficient protection guaranteed. Information received of maltreatment suffered by an inoffensive American woman en gaged in missionary work in Turkish Koordistan was followed by such rep resentations to the porte a3 resulted in the issuance of orders for the punish ment of her assailants, the removal of a delinquent official, and the adop tion of measures for the I protection of our citizens engaged in mission and other lawful work in that quarter. Turkey complains that her Armenian subjects obtain citizenship In this coun try, not to identify themselves In good faith with our people, but with the in tention of returning to the land of their birth and then engaging in sedition. This complaint is not wholly without foundation. A journal published in this country in the Armenian language openly .counsels its readers to arm, organize and participate in movements for the subversion of Turkish authority In the Asiatic provinces. The Ottoman government has announced its intention , to expel from its dominion Armenians who nave obtained naturalization in the I United States since 1868..

A Special Message Will Be Laid ; v.j*.;. Before Congress. It is hardly necessary for me to state' that the questions arisihg from our rela tions with Hawaii bave caused serious embarrassment. Just prior to the installment of . the present administration, the existing government of Hawaii had been sud denly overthrown and a treaty of an nexation had been negotiated between the provisional government of the islands and the United States and sub mitted to the senate for ratification. This treaty 1 withdrew for examination, and dispatched Hon. James Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special com missioner to make an impartial investi gation of the circumstances attending the change of government aud of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and ex haustive examination, Mr. Blount sub mitted to me his report, showing be yond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii* had been sub verted with the active aid of our repre sentative to tbat government and through the Intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States, which was lauded ofr that purpose at the instance for our minister. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us, and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible in tervention. With a view of accomplish ing this result within the constitutional limit of executive power, and recogniz ing all our obligations and responsibil ities growing out of any changed condi tion brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate in structions to that end. Thus far no in formation of the accompiishmeut of any definite results has been received from him. Additional advices are soon ex pected. "When received they will be promptly sent to the congress, together with all other. information at hand, ac _ companied by a 

SPECIAL EXECUTIVE MESSAGE, fully detailing all the facts necessary to a complete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all the ma terial events leading up to the present situation. :•.,.-<:<•- -o ARBITRATION l'r: With Foreign Countries When Oar Diplomats Fail. £ By a concurrent resolution, passed by. the senate Feb. 14, 1890, and by the house of representatives on the 3d of April following, the president ; was . re quested "to invite from- time to time, as fit occasion may arise, negotiations with any government with which the United States has or may have diplomatic rela tions, to the end that any differences or disputes arising between the two gov ernments which cannot be adjusted by diplomatic agency may be referred 'to arbitration, and be peaceably adjusted by such means." April 18, 1890, the international American conference of Washington, by resolution, expressed the wish that all controversies between the republics of America and the na tions of Europe might be settled by ar bitration, and recommended that the government of each nation represented in that conference should communicate this wish to all friendly powers. A favorable response has been received from Great Britain in the shape of a resolution adopted by parliament July 16 last, cordially sympathizing with the purpose in view, and expressing the hope that her majesty's government will lend ready co-operation to the gov ernment of the United States upon the basis of the concurrent resolution above quote i. *?,'"• "ZiYlZ.'f It affords me signal pleasure to lay this parliamentary resolution before the congress, and to express my gratifica tion that the sentiment ot two great and kindred nations is thus authoritatively manifested iii favor of the rational and peaceable settlement of - international quarrels by honorable resort to arbitra tion. -*.-,*'; "? v Since the passage of the act of March 3, 1893, authorizing the president to raise the grade of our envoys to corre spond with the rank which foreign countries accord to their agents here.

The 'silver dollars that ' have been coined under the act of July ; 14, 1890, number 36,087,285.

During the calendar year 1892, the pro duction of precious metals in the United ; States was estimated to be 1,590,375 fine ounces of gold, of the commercial and coinage value of $33,000,000. aud 58,000, --000 fine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $50,750,000, and of the coiuage value of $74,989,900.

One hundred and nineteen national Danks were organized during the year ended Oct. 31, 1893, with a capital of $11,230,000. Forty-six went into voluntary liquidation and 158 sus pended. Sixty-five of the suspended banks were insolvent, 86 resumed busi ness, and 7 remained in the hands of bank examiners with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the new banks organized 44 were located in the Eastern states, 41 west of the Mississippi river aud 34 in the Central and Southern * states. The total uumber of national banks in existence on the 81st day of October, 1893, was 3.796, having an ag gregate capital of $095,558,120. The net increase in the circulation of these banKs during the year was $36,886,972. The recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the government as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs, and I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impos sible. to know at this time precisely what conditions, will be brought about by the change, or what, if any, supple mentary legislation may, in the light of such conditions, appear to be. essential or expedient. Of course, after the re cent financial perturbation, time is nec essary for the establishment of business confidence. When, however, through this restored confidence the money which has beeu frightened into hoarding places is returned to trade aud enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading .to a per manently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our increasing population and of bus iness. In the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from allur ing and temporary.. expedients, deter mined to be content with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive finan cial plan. . lv these circumstances lam convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with this subject, instead of being injurious, will increase the prob abilities of 'Wise action. -Zf : " i The monetary conference "which' as sembled at Brussels upon our invitation, was adjourned to the 30th day of No vember in the present year. The con siderations just stated and the fact that a definite proposition from us seemed to be expected upon .the reassembling '. of: the conference, led me to express a will ingness to have the meeting further postponed. It seems? to ;me that it would be wise to give general authority to the president to invite other nations to such a conference at any time when there should be a fair prospect of ac complishing an international agreement on the subject of coinage. 1 desire also to earnestly suggest the wisdom of amending the existing statutes iv re gard to the issuance of government bonds.

The total arrivals were 14L034 less than for the previous year. The secretary, in his report, gives an account of the operation of the marine hospital service, and of the good work done under Its supervision in preventing the entrance and spread of contagions dis eases. The admonitions of the last two years touching our public health and the demonstrated danger of the intro duction of contagious diseases from foreign ports has invested the subject of national quarantine with increased interest A more general and har monious system than now exists, acting promptly and directly everywhere, and constantly operating by preventive means to shield our country from the invasion of disease, and at the same time baying due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would, I believe, add greatly to the safety of our people. -_ zIZZf-X jfjl .

In addition to the product .of the army gun factory, now completed at: Watervliet, the government has contracted with private . parties for the purchase of 100 guns of these cali bersi the first of which should be de livered to the department for test before July 1. 1894. The manufacture of heavy ordnance keeps pace with current needs, but to render these guns availa ble for the purposes they are designed to meet; emplacements must be pre pared for them. Progress has been made in this direction, and it is desirable that congress, by adequate appropriations, should provide for the uninterrupted prosecution of this 'necessary work. After much preliminary work and ex haustive examination in accordance with requirements of law the board ap pointed to select a magazine rifle of modern type, with which to replace the obsolete . Springfield rifle of the in fantry service, completed its labors dur ing the last year, aud the work of manu facture is now in progress at the na tional armory at Springfield, lt is con fidently expected that by the end of the current year our infantry will be sup plied with a weapon equal to that of the most progressive armies of the world. The work on the projected , Chicka mauga and Chattanooga national mil itary park has been prosecuted -with zeal aud judgment, and the opening will be celebrated during the coming year. zx-ZzZ ... Over nine square miles of the Chick araauga battlefield have been acquired, twenty-five miles of roadway have been constructed and permanent tablets have been placed at many historical points, while the invitation to the states to mark the positions of -their troops par ticipating in the battle has been very generally accepted. The work of locat ing and preserving the lines of battle at the Gettysburg battlefield is v making satisfactory progress on the plans di rected by the last congress. The re ports of the military academy at West Point, and the several schools for spe cial instruction ... of officers, show marked advance in education of the array and a commendable ambition among its officers to excel iv the mili tary profession, and to fit themselves for the highest service to the country. Under the supervision of Adjt. Gen. Robert Williams, lately retired, the bureau of military information has be come well established, and is perform ing a service that will put in possession oi the government in time of war most valuable information, and at all times serve a purpose of great utility in keep ing the army advised of the world's progress in ail matters pertaining to the art of war. , 

LEGAL AFFAIRS. Fee System Is Condemned—De grees of Federal Jurisdiction. The report of the attorney general contains the usual summary of the affairs and proceedings of the depart-, ment of justice for the past year, to gether with certain recommendations as to needed legislation on various sub jects. 1 cannot too heartily indorse the propositien that the fee system, as ap plicable to the compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal courts and United States com missioners, should be abolished with as little delay as possible. It is clearly in the interest of the community that the business of the courts, both civil aud criminal, shall be as small and as inex pensively transacted as the ends of jus tice will allow. The system is, there fore, thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation of court officials de pend upon the volume of such business, and thus creates a conflict between a proper execution of the law and private gain, which cannot fail to be dangerous to the rights and freedom of the citi zens, an irresistible temptation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If in addition to this reform an other were Inaugurated which would give to United States commissioners the final disposition of petty offenses within the grade of misdemeanors, especially those coming under the internal reve nue laws, a great advance would be made toward a more decent adminis tration of the criminal laws, In my first message to . congress, dated Dec - 8, 1885, I strongly recom mended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the evils of the present system. Since that time the criminal business, of the federal courts, and the expense attending it, have enormously increased. The num ber of criminal prosecutions pending in the circuit and district courts of the United States on the Ist day of July, .1885,' was 3,808, of which 1,884 were for violations of the internal revenue laws, while the number of i such prosecutions pending on the Ist . day., of July, 1893.: was 9,500, of which 4,200 were for viola tion of. the internal revenue laws. The expense of the Uuited States courts, ex clusive of judges' salaries, for the year ending July 1, .1885, was $2,874,733.11, and for. the year-ending July 1, 1893, $4,528,676.87. It is therefore apparent that the . reasons given in 1885 for a change in the manner of enforcing the federal criminal law 'have gained co gency and strength by lapse of time. I also heartily join . the attorney general in recommending legislation fixing de grees of. federal jurisdiction, as has been done in many cf the states, au thorizing writs of error on behalf of the government in cases where the final judgment is rendered against the suffi ciency of an indictment or against the government upon any other question arising before actual trial limiting the right of review in cases of felony pun ishable only by fine. and imprisonment to the circuit court of appeal, and mak ing speedy provision for the construc tion of such prisons- and .reformatories as may be necess_4&-br the confinement of United States convicts. .

MAIL DEPARTMENT. Postal Revenues Reduced by the Hard Times. : - ..; The report of the postmaster general contains a detailed statement of the operations of , the postoffice department during \ the last fiscal year, an I ; much : interesting ? Information :: touching > this important branch of r the public service. The business of the mails indicates with absolute certainty the condition of the _ business of the country,' ana depression in financial affairs inevitably and quick ly re Juces the .*; postal • revenues. That _ there "was _. a larger discrepancy than usual _. between the toffice receipts ~'-: '■'■ '* ■ ' 'Zi "."...* -';-*■■ '--• * ■ ■■• 5 ■ and expenditures is the expected . and unavoidable result of the distressing stringency which has prevailed through out | the x country during ' mnch <of the '-. time covered by the postmaster gen eral's report.:. At a? date when better: times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessors that . the deficiency ou the 80th day of June, 1893, would be . but a little over $1,500,000. it amounted; , however," to '_ more .than $6.000,000. .-, At the same time, and: under the influence of like anticipations, estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending 'June So, 1894.? which exhibited a surplus ' of revenue over expenditures of $872. --245.71: but now,. in. view of the actual receipts and expenditures during that* part of the current fiscal year already expired, the present postmaster general estimates that, at its close, instead of a surplus, there will be a deficiency of nearly $8,000,000. The postoffice receipts for ' the last ? fiscal : year amounted to : $75,896,933.16, and its expenditures to $81,074,104.90. This postofflce deficiency would disappear," or be immensely de-: creased, if less matter was cartied free through the mails, an item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain* from the agricultural department. The total number of'postoffices In the United States on the 30th day of June, 1893, was 68,403, an increase of 1,284 over the preceding year. Of these, 3,360 were presidential, an .increase in that class of 204 over the preceding year. Forty-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing, making a total of 610 cities and towns provided with free delivery on June 30, 1893. Ninety-three other cities and towns are entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been ac corded thera on account of insufficient funds to meet the expense of its estab lishment. _. I am decidedly of the opinion that the provisions of the present law permit as general an introduction of this feature of mail service as is necessary or justi fiable, and that "it ought not to be ex tended to smaller communities thau are now designated. The expeuse of free delivery for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, will be more than .11,000.000, and uuder legislation now existing there must be a constant increase in this item of expenditure. There were 6,101 additions to the domestic money order offices during the last fiscal year, being the largest increase in any year si nee the inauguration of the system. The total uumber of those offices at the close ot the year was 18,434. There were 18,309.735 money orders Issued from these offices, being' an in crease over the preceding year ot 1,240, --290, and the value of those orders amounted to $127,576,488.65. an increase of $7,509,632.59. There were also issued during the year postal notes ainouuting to $12,903,076.73. During the year 195 international money order offices were added to those already provided, making a total of 2,407 iv operation on June 30, 1893. The number of* international money orders issued daring the year was 1,055,999, an increase over the preceding year of 72, --525, and their value was $10,341,837.86, an increase of $1,221,500.31. The num ber of orders paid was 300.917, an in crease over the preceding year of 13,503, and their value was 55,283,375.70, an in crease of $94,094.83. From the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money orders and postal notes for the year amounted to $150,831,348.21. The number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special de livery was 3,375,093, an increase over the preceding year of nearly"22 per cent. The special delivery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted to $337,509.30, and the messengers' fees paid for their delivery amounted to $256,592.71, leaving a profit to the gov- ■ ernment of $80,970.50. The railway mail service not only adds to the promptness of mail delivery at all offices, but it is the especial instru mentality which puts the smallei and way places in the service on an equality in that regard with the larger and terminal offices.. This branch of the postal sorvice has, therefore, received much attention from the postmaster general, and though it is gratifying to know that it is in a condition of high efficiency, and- great usefulness, I an ted to agree with the postmaster gen eral that there is room for its further improvement. There are now connected with the postoffice establishment 2B,324 employes, who are in the classified service. The head of this great departmeutgives'con clusive evidence of the value of civil service reform when, after an experi ence that renders his judgment on the subject absolutely reliable, he expresses the opinion that without the benefit of this system It would be Impossible to conduct the vast business entrusted. 1 desire to commend, as especially worthy of prompt attention, the 'suggestions of 1 the postmaster general in relation to a more sensible and businesslike organi zation and a belter distribution of re sponsibility in his department. ifijf OUR
