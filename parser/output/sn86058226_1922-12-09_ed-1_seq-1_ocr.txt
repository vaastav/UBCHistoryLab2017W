MALLON WASHINGTON, Dec 9 Congress to day took Initial steps to carry out the huge legislative program outlined yea terday by President Harding although it is realized that all the recommenda tions cannot be enacted at this ses sion. The legislative situation as the re sult of the president's address may be summarized as follows: Taxation The house ways and means committee -will ask the rules committee next week to arrange to sandwich between appropriation bills, resolutions for amending the constitu tion to prohibit tax exempt securities, Ways and means leaders hope to have the house adopt the resolution next Wednesday. Will Aid Farmers agriculture and banking and currency committees wiu tackie a mass 01 leg islatlon and try to whip Into shape a bill that will satisfy the farm bloc and the administration. In the house the Anderson bill, creating a farm credits department with $5,000,000 capital In each federal reserve bank, probably will be the basis of commit tee work. Railroads The president s recom mendation for abolition of the railroad labor board and his other suggested legislative reforms in the transporta tion law will be considered by the hrtuse and senate interstate commerce committees at meetings to be held within a few days. If Mr. Harding's recommendations for a merger of the railroads into a few big systems, and for legislation to prevent strikes, are insisted upon, there can be no rail road legislation at this session. It is considered unlikely by leaders that. with the appropriation bills and other routine problems to attend to, con press will find time this winter to tackle the big controversial question of railroad legislation. Immigration Discussion Immigration The senate and house immigration committees will meet the coming week. White immigration is considered too large' a question for sat isfactory solution in the hustle of a short session there will be much dls- cuion of- it Tha i hausa-committeajw will have hearings on resolutions ad mitting war refugees' from Turkey and Thrace. . Mr. Harding's suggestion for regis tration of aliens would require treaties and is Inaxtvisable in the opinion of the house leaders. Chairman Johnson of the house committee wants to re duce the present three per cent limit on immigration to 1)4 per cent. Child Labor The house judiciary committee probably will present a resolution amending the constitution to give congress power to prevent child labor- Prohibition The president's denun ciation of violators of the Volstead act and the 18th amendment was expected to result in new legislative sugges tions.
