The opinion is unanimous among football players and coaches that many of the fatal accidents of this year have been due to players par ticipating in the game without prop er conditioning and a faulty system of tackling. The latter is probably more responsible for serious dents than anything else. Nasaka claims that Tanijuji made the first pass, when he countered his blow and stabbed him to death. The murdered man fell on his face and died instantly. Special officer Rich was called and arrested Nasaka who is now on his way to jail at Winnemucca. The murdered man has a wife in Sparks. no Crops Show Great Gain The year 1909 has been the most prosperous year in a decade for the American farmer. Secretary Wilson of the Department of Agriculture, in his report for the fiscal year ending June 30th. declares the farmers' pock et book has been enriched beyond their wildest dreams but he does not say how much of it remained in the purse nor how much went to the rail roads and various commission mer- accl- .chants. .

SOCIETY WILL SEEPLAY Princess Bonnie Will Probably Be Presented at Local Play house in Near Future "Princess Bonnie," conceded aa being the very best amateur show ever played, and after entertaining a crowded house at the Wheelman Theater in Reno was reproduced at the earnest request of the people of that city, will more than likely be staged in this city in the near future. The St. Peters' Guild of this city is now arranging to have this popu lar play produced at the local theater and it is to be hoped their efforts will be successful, as "Princess Bon nie," although to 'be staged by ama teurs, ranks with even those of the best professionals. Jack O'Sullivan, well and favorably known to Carson people, is the lead ing man, and Mrs. Stoddard and Miss Madge McMillian, also well known as delightful entertainers, as sume the roles of leading ladies. Miss McMillan is the daughter of Mr. McMillan of the Carson Valley bank of this city. If arrangement- now oinder way are completed "Princess Bonnie" will be presented under the auspices of St. Peters' Guild of this city and it will be an event well appreciated by all. -oo- MURDERER IN PRISON IS Casey Sentenced to Death has Arrived Here. Death Watch Will be Placed In the District Court at Goldfield Saturday Judge Theron A. Stevens pronounced sentence on Patrick C. Casey, convicted of the murder of Mrs. Thomas Heslip several months ago, to hang in the State Prison at Carson, on Tuesday, March 1st. In pronouncing sentence the court stat ed that he objected to the custom of naming Friday, and had selected Tuesday in hopes that other courts would lollow suit, thus doing away with the old time-honored form. Deputy Sheriff Mike Cahalan of Goldfield, -rrived in this city with Casey. The prisoner was brought on the cut-off through Dayton to Mound House, and to this city on the V. & T. He seemed entirely indifferent to the curions gaze of fellow travelers and gave little indication of being a des perate character. The Sheriff was glad when Carson was reached although no trouble at all was experienced on the trip up torn the Southern country. Congress Now In Session The two houses of congress con vened yesterday for the first regular session of the 61st congress, but the day's proceedings were in a great part of a social nature, and practical ly no business was transacted. The Senate session was brief last ing only thirteen minutes. The house session continued for 40 minutes. W. W. McCreedie, the new representotive from the second Wash ington district who succeeds rhe late Francis Cushman, sworn in. Although only 351 members re sponded to their names, almost a full membership appeared on the house floor, and there were ie who did not have one or more bills to offer. A joint committee was named by both houses to wait upon the pre, dent and inform him that congress was in tession and ready for any busi ness he might wish to lay before it. The president's response will con tinue his annual message, the read ing of which consumed nearly all of today's session. o
