The sudden change from the warm climate of Cuba, with the hardships he had there endured, to the wintry weather of Nev York and Washington ls respon? sible for the pneumonia which resulted in his death. On Tuesday Bight General Garcia, in company with the other members of the commission, at? tended dinner given in his honor by General Hiles, nnd it was a result of the exposure that night which culmin? ated in his death. By direction of Major Coners! Miles a :ers from Battery E. Sixth artillery, at the barracks here, vader command ox Lieutenant Cox, was detailed as a body guard for the remains.

Op an lah Banoo Game (becked. Washington. Dec. 14.?From informa? tion received here it appears that the autonomist government of Cuba, es? tablished about one year ago, ls making a strenuous effort to dispose of a num? ber of very valuable franchises and concessions before tho advent of th'? military government of the United States. These franchises and conces? sions include the right to construct and operate the Central railroad line of the island, including ll branches, and also a network of electric tramways for Ha? vana. The Spaniards proposed to dis? pose of the franchises on E*ec. 29. ? wo days barfora American occupation, and they were to run 99 years.

Tho Mon Wore shoveling Snow, and Iii Leaving tbe Krelgtit Track to Ks cape an Approaching 'fruin Stopped In Front of an Kxproass. Buffalo. Dec. 14.?Eight men were i and three injured yesterday at Wlnspeare bridge, near Corfu, on the New York Ceneral railroad. Th engaged in shoveling snow, of which there were numerous drifts on the line. All were frightfully mutil? ated. The men stepped from one track tc avoid an approaching train, right In front of a fast express train running in the same direction as the first, and waaa literally ground to pieces. John Warner and gang were working on track No. 3. A freight train was laboring its way ponderously up the steep Incline. Its motion was so slow that the men continued their work un? til the train was almost upon them. Then they jumped out of the way. Some Jumped to the right, others to the j left. Those who Jumped to the north escaped. Most of those who Jumped to J the south were struck by the express train coming down track No. 2 with fearful velocity. There ls a straight of track here, and the engineer had a clear view down the stretch. No snow was falling. As soon as he realized tho appalling situation Iv brought the train up with a Jerk that threw thc possengers out of their seats. I too late, however, to avoid the. calamity. The bodies were scattered over a large area. Some had been thrown a distance of CO feet. Others were thrown against the freight train and their a horribly cut and dismembered. Tho body of one man was hurled en to ;> oi the freight train and carried nearly two miles. The bowels of some of the men were scattered along the track. Brains oozed from Bhapeleea skulls. Dismembered leg:-., arms and bodies strewed the crimson snow. The more fortUB !'anions of the dead and Injured gathered up the :nts tr rrerher as nearly as they could Judge in human form, and placed them tenderly in tho baggage car of the train that killed them, and they were taken to Buffalo. The dead are: John Warner, of Buf? falo, foreman of the shoveling gang. instantly trilled; Henry donnison, Buf instantly killed: six unidentified men. supposed to bc P< '.?

I harl let up on the whistle, when I heard my fireman give a yell. He did not call for brattan, but I slapped on the air the minute 1 heard him. He had seen a man beside the track, though he had not seen any one struck then. A moment after I applied the brakes I saw a man shoot up Into the air on my side of tho rab.

The dead so far recovered are: An Wendt. workman: Pious Baum. engineer in adjacent factory; John Oray. 73 years old. George Bremer, a timekeeper, and 15-year-old George Winkle are doubtless burned beneath the ruins, as well as others. The collapse of the tank caused the rapture of some of the great water mains which were constructed to feed it. and fer some time these poured their torrents Into the street. W. J. Logan, of the Logan iron works, of Oreenpoint. I-. I., the contractor who was building the tank, was placed under arrest. William II.
