KING, County.Health Commissioner ALBERT B. STEEN, County Sheriff. Dec. 18, 1911. 18-19-20 Already the railroad stations are full of people with large bundles and far spreading baggage. Those who come in from the small towns have large market baskets from which there stick out the feet of birds too large to be chickens. All the world is on the move. But there are some scenes that cast a shadow over all this gaiety. There was a young mother dressed in shabby black the other night at the Pennsylvania station. Her black shces had evidently been improvised from last summer's flimsy tan oxfords. A ten cent bottle of blacking had been used to transform them from the cheap gew gaws of marriage to some thing more nearly appropriate to go with the rest of her black costume. And the reason for this might have been seen on a truck just a little way up the board platform. It was a pine box. The girl's face was not streaming with tears. But the eyes were swol len as she went about the commonplace work of taking care of the shawl wrapped bundle which filled her arms. A smile flitted over her face now and then as she laid the shawl aside and took a peep at the contents of tho bundle. It was a baby. It was a woman with a baby. It was a crying, squalling baby. But that did not seem to make much difference to her. If she cared it was only a because it meant that the small bundle was in pain. At that moment a big, blundering, boisterous man whom everybody knows burst into the room with an obvious over-load of pre-Christmas cheer on his breath. There were a few oaths on his breath too. His scarlet tie was Blightly askew. His waistcoat was mussed anrl s-1' r "Sh-sh!" "You'll wake the baby," said sr me one. Then a Christmas miracle hap.ened. There went through the man's trame a quiver which him. He removed his hat. His eyes accustomed to horse judging took in the situa tion. He stood somewhat abashed and then walked slowly up to the young girl. "Say er-ah. I don't know exactly how to say this. But it appears to me that you might be in trouble of some sort and well or T' like to help. How soon does your train leave?" "Had any thing to eat?" "No." "Well don't make any excuses. Come with me." He did not stop for the woman to make any answer but Ud the way. It was only the station restaurant. But it might have been the Inn at Bethlehem. It. Was a very homely, crude, unbeautiful proceeding. There are a number of very respectable citizens who would have drawn away their garments lest they might be polluted or misunderstood. But before the train left the entire outfit in the station restaurant had been organized into a Society of Good fellows. The train men who know death and accident and small babies at home assembled under the rough man's leadership. As the train pulled out, a small roll of bills passed from the waist coat pocket of the Large Man into the list of the Christmas Child. The Trainmen kept their vigil. ARBITRATION NOT HEW APRIMCIPLE Peace Policy of the United States Established Score of Years Ago. WASHINGTON", Dec. 18. When a year ago President Taft proposed to adopt arbitration treaties with foreign powers, the whole world was thrilled j by the magnitude of the action, but j the people of the United States so of ten prone to do so, seemed to have for gotten that the United States senate had, twenty one years before, taken a similar action with as far-reaching effects. The peace policy of the United States is by no means new; on tbi contrary, is nearly as old as the coun try itself. Tor more than a hundred yesfrs this country has stood for arbi tration of international disputes, but it not until 1890 that the senate adopted a resolution which made the policy mor all-embracing than before. In the nation's infancey, the obvious course to pursue was the safest one, when questions of international af fairs came to the front. Weak as com pared to the other powers a century : ago, it was necessary for the pilots of ! the government to adopt policies ( g, received the proposition of the ratifi cation of these treaties. Political parties seem to have al lowed their feelings, if they have any, to lie dormant as far as the peace trea ties are concerned. Nor is the attitude of the senate due to partisan division. The apathy it exhibits spreads over both parties. On the fourteenth of February, 1890. the United States senate adopted a res olution calling on the president to ini tiate negotiations with foreign govern ments on the subject of arbitration treaties. This was merely a revival of the old time policy of the nation, which brought the question forcibly before the people. Three months later the house of rep resentatives concurred in the senate resolution. It was not until three years later that the British house of commons adopted a reciprocal resolu tion. The resolution expressed the hope that the government would put itself on record as manifesting an in clination to co-operate with the Unit ed States in the arbitration matter. For about a decade after these res olutions were adopted by both the American and British legislative as semblies, no advantage was taken of them. In the beginnins of his second term, President Cleveland was deeply inter ested in the arbitration question. In his first message he referred to the resolutions passed by the American and British houses, heartily endorsing the policy. President Cleveland's secretary of state, Mr. Gresham, immediately be gan negotiations with the Marquis of Salisbury for a general arbitration tre ty. These negotiations were shelved, however, when the difficulty between England and the United States over the Venzuelan boundary developed. With the great men of the world all declaring in favor of the judiciaJ settlement of international disputes, with peace conferences being held ev erywhere, and with associations for the promotion of the peace propoun ds being everywhere agitated, the idea that a new policy is being ex ploited has gained a strong hold up the people. This is not the case. The peace pol icy of the United States is nearly as old as any policy it boasts, but un doubtedly much good can come of the peace Rennaiscence, and certainly no harm. There is no particular lesson, moral or text which we wish to be ap plied to this. Somewhere perhaps the big lout who follows the races had heard the phrase "In as much as ye have done it unto the least of these ye have done it unto me." But what was more likely he simply saw a woman with a baby. Does it make much difference that he did not see the Mother and Child of Christmas?

International complications invariably result to the detriment of the weaker nation in volvd and none knew this better than those statesmen who directed the ear ly affairs of the United States. With the whole of Europe aflame with international strife, a strong ob ject lesson in the benefits of peace was administered to this country. In consequence, the congress did its best to adopt policies which would permit of the peaceable arbitration of all in ternational disputes. This policy was closely adhered to and many say the nation owes its existenc in a great part to its non-belligerent attitude dur ing the past century. Careful consideration of all these important factors make doubly inter esting the arbitration treaties between the United States and England and France, now pending before the sen ate for ratification. The message of President Taft on foreign relations read before both houses of Congress December 7 urges that these treaties be ratified. Three particularly inter esting points in connection with these treaties challenge attention. First, the broad scope of the treaties them selves which do not exclude from ar bitration matters of vital interest and national honor. Second, the attitude of the senate, which at the present time does not seem to entertain a particularly cor dial view of the desirejd ratification. Third, that the subject of these trea ties is essentially a non-partisan mat ter. 'The scope of the proposed treaties is unusually broad. It is specifically stated that "any disputes or differ ences may be referred to arbitration." This includes even questions in which the national honor is involved. It seems that with advanced civiliza tion the country abhors the idea of going to war even though matters near to the heart of Americans are involv- I ed. Witness the fact that there are no rumors of war over the treatment which Americans of the Jewish faith have received in Russia. Many anoth er country would have declared war an hour after the news was received. It is hard to account for the lack of enthusiasm with which the senate has QODDOODDaDaDDDDDnoDDDDDooDODanDDDDODDaaDannnnDDDonoDDDnaniiDQ OWN GO THE
