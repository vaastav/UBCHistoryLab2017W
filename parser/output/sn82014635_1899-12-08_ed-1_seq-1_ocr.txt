Washington, Dec. 7. General Otis has c ibled the war department as follows, rt .-peotlrig the military situation in Lu 2 n- "In central Luzon there is no insur er nt force of importance except In Bula ?n province, near the mountains, where General Pilar holds together 1,000 or more luen. which will be attacked soon. Gen eral Grant has moved a small column, o wn the oast coast of Bataan province, countering little opposition; a column moving west and from the mountains is expected to reach the western coast of Luzon on the 10th instant. Many small insurgent armed bands are in the coun try robbing and in some instances mur dering the inhabitants, which are being ; irsued by troops quite successfully. To the south of Manila the insurgents still Srjjntain their positions but the neces e ry force to scatter them will be sent t' to soon." "Mxrlla, Dec. 7 (10:50 p. m.). Tho expec-it- Hon of catching Aguinaldo In the north 3 as Teon practically abandoned and the probability now is that he will turn iuthward, if he Is not already there, th his destination, Cavite province, his lioran, where the Insurrection began and where It still has its greatest strength. Tie Filipino soldiers In that province hive recently been showing increased en thusiasm and boldness, and captured in-t-jrgents say that Aguinaldo is coming Join thorn with a large army. The . .no belief prevails among the natives r ' Manila and elsewhere that Aguinaldo l-'nds to make his headquarters in Ca v e province.

Th American forces in tho north have f ri'ed into many small commands r ! ,ire pursuing bands of Filipinos.

Colonel Bell Is sweeping south i n Managatarem. Tlius far tlie Amer 1 ""l commanders have beon unable to lo c i large bodies of insurgents, although t r wero about 500 in San Clementine, iro miles south of Managatarem early in the week.

Gen eral Wheaton is In Tayugu. Most of his troops In the vicinity are garrisoned in nearby towns. General MacArthur Is on the railroad at Bayambang. Colonel Bell is following westward into the mountains the remnants of General Alenjandrine's troops, estimated at 2.S00 men. Burt Is moving with a small command from O'Donnell westward over the mountains to Iba. on the coast. General Grant is moving from Florida Blanca southward to Balanga, Bataan province. Cavite province will be the seat of an active campaign when enough troops ar rive to hut off all avenues of escape, unless an unexpected surrender occurs. All the 65.000 American troops will be easily absorbed in active campaigning and garrisoning. The army cannot continue its present exertions aother month with the poor food found in the country, with out much illness. It is the general opinion that the five known insurgent garrisons, of more than 2,000 men each, will at the present rate be disintegrated Into guerilla bands with in thirty days. It is the impression of the military authorities that 20,000 men will be sufficient to garrison Luzon a few months hence. Field officers and others insist, however, that -unless the natives surrender their arms Luzon must be gar risoned town by town, while protection must toe guaranteed to the natives now "on the fence,:" until a reaction In favor of the Americans begins.

DESPERATE BATTLES Are to be Expected in Very Near Future, the Pietermaritzburg, Dec. 5. General Buller and his sta have started for the front. London, Dec. 8. 5 a, m. General Bul ler's arrival at Frere is held to Indicate that all the preparations for an advance to the relief of Ladysmith are complete and that stirring news will soon be re ceived. The fact that Lord Methuen Is announced as resuming his command at almost the same moment is interpreted in some quarters to mean that battles will be fought siultaneously in Natal and at Spytfontein. It appears doubtful, how ever, whether General Methuen's force is yet ready for what will evidently be a heavy encounter. The construction of the temporary bridge ijross Modder River has entailed enormous labor, and even now the structure is liable to be washed away should a heavy storm come. General Methuen has been obliged to move his camp a mile north In conse quence of the unsanitary condition of the stream, due to the presence of bodies of dead Boens. As the railway bridge was completely destroyed, he was compelled to leave a considerable force to protect his communications. BOERS SHOOT AT KHVLING RANGE A special correspondent sends the In teresting information, regarding Boer tactics, that Commandant General Jou bert has given general orders to reserve fire until the British are within the close range of 400 yards. At the Modder River battle the Free State burghers became nervous, opened fire prematurely, thus revealing their position, and frustrated the Boer's plans. A KICK ON THE WAU OEFICE The Morning Post publishes an article warning the British public that the disil lusionment already experienced respect ing the Boer forces in Natal is likely to be repeated on the western border. It says that men are wanted everywhere and asks why the splendid body of Royal Marines is now being employed In sweep ing floors and washing paint and is not sent in to handle the naval guns, instead of the hurriedly trained men, unfamiliar with these weapons, who have gone. The government has decided to dispatch to South Africa at the earliest possible moment (a cavalry brigade of about 4,000 men. O 031 rATJI, WASTED A NAVY Baron Loch, former governor of Cape Colony and British high commissioner for South Africa, lecturing in London last evening, related some of his experiences with President Ivruger. Ho said the re marks of the Transvaal president years ago showed that he contemplated just the state of aairs which had now arisen. Mr. Ivruger even expressed a deside to have a seaport, and said the Transvaal hoped to have a navy some day. The Times, commenting upon Lord Loch's reminis ences, says that they prove, up to the hilt, the Dutch ambition for Dutch su premacy in South Africa. GOT TO 

EEEI 10,000 3JASUTQS London, Dec. S. The Daily Mall pub lishes a dispatch from Julian Ralph at Modder River, who says: "The Kim berley people are troubled by the neces sity of feeding 10,000 Basutos in the dia mond fields, whom the Boers refuse to allow to depart, and who, should they fall to get enough meat, become discon tented and restless. On the night of the battle at Modder River, Kimberley, m'ss Ing the accustomed signals from here, was in great anxiety, fearing that we had -been defeated. The fact was that we did not use our searchlight for fear the Boer guns would wreck the apparatus. Five hundred"and thirty Boers were killed or wounded in the battle here. That number has already "been accounted for and the enemy's losses were probably much heavier." JUST TO KEEP THE DOERS BUSY A special dispatch from Kimberley, dat ed Wednesday, November 29, says: "-Is a result of signals from the relief force to tho south and of certain movements on the part of tho Boers, Colonel Keke wlch determined to make a sortie with a view of keeping a large force of Boers employed here. Yesterday afternoon a portion of the garrison, with artillery un der Major Chamier and mounted troops under Major Scott-Turner, advanced southwest toward the Boer positions and captured Carter's farm, which completed the line it was intended to hold in view of Lord Methuen's early approach. Major Scott-Turner then turned nis attention to the Boer iaaser, which he captured in fine style, in spite of the enemy's heavy fire. All the camp equipment was cap tured or destroyed. Finally the British stormed the ridge and captured three re doubts .after severe fighting. In leading the men who were storming the fourth redoubt, Major Scott-Turner and Lieuten ant "Wright were killed. It Is alleged that they were struck by explosive out lets. The death of Major Scott-Turner compelled the British to retire upoc Car ter's farm, the whole affair having lasted four hours." METHUEN HAS KDIBBKI.KY NKVTS London, Dec 7. Mornlng.' The war otticA here has received the following message from General Forestier-Walker, the British commander at Case Town, dated "Wednesday. December 6: "General Methuen wires today that he has resum ed command and is nightly in communi cation with Kunberley. The health of the trooiw Is excellent." LADYSMITH KAFnKGKA3IS A story was current a: Durban on Tuesday, December 5, to the effect that the Boers made what is thought to have been their final effort to capture Lady smith. December 1, and wr abated and retreatfd As th st r. n i- r ':s bv runtpr :t ''i u 2 b- - ' t reservation, as the Barenaouuy of the-e "kafiirgrams" Is notorious. According t thi r"ort. the B."- ojred a furi ous bombardment during theim-r-ing of Dccmbor 4. ani conMiLod. at f-- hours j when the British Qnay silescJ the J Boer guns, made a sortie and hard fight ing followed, the Boers retreating after very heavy losses, sustained in hundreds. FREE STATERS "WITHDRAWING The dispatches from, Frere Cama, par tially confirm a retirement of Free State burghers from the vicinity of Ladysmith, but do not indicate that the retreat was the result of a defeat on the previous day, while tho statement in the same dispatch that the Boers were firing into Ladysmith shpws the Boers guns were still active. It is also pointed out that all suggestions of weakening refer to the Free Stater3. Apparently the Boers are still full of fight, though it is reiterated that they are short of sup plies. Perhaps an explanation of the re tirement of burghers from Natal can be found in a disnatch from Modder River, December 3, saying that a strong Boer force, estimated to number 3,000 men. was reinforcing General Cronje from Natal. HERE THE NEXT FIGHT WIEX, BE The same dispatch says everything points to the fact that a great engage ment will be fought at Spyfontein. The BBoers are massing on,Jthe hills there, are vigorously building stone defenses, and are digging rifle pits in every direc tion. The Boers redoubts on Larezetto Ridge, west of Kimberley, are also being extended and strengthened, showing that the rumors of the intention of the Boers to abandon the attempt to stem General Methuen's advance are unfounded. The British have shifted their camp a few hundred yards away from the battlefield and are settling down for a week. There are signs of fever among the troops. Much depends on General Gatacre's ad vance. There is undoubtedly a large con centration of Beers ahead of General Methuen. Practically the whole of their Mafeklng forces have Joined the Kimber ley besiegers. THE KIMBERLEY SORTES An official account of the sortie at Kim berley November 2S, whan the British casualties, as cabled yesterday, occurred, says: "The British demonstrated tow ards "Wimbleden rifle ranse. -The enemy's guns were positioned from the ridire at Spitzkop to "Wimbleden Siding. Major Scott-Turner, with the mounted troops, attacked the enemy's flank, capturing a laager and three redoubts. The enemy, in a fourth redoubt, made a stubborn re sistance, when Major Scott-Turner was killed. The British captured many shells and destroyed olher stores." The same dispatch gives reports from Colonel Kekewich, dated December 3 and 4, showing "the Boers were Increasing in numbers around Kimberley. BRITISH AND BOER LOSSES The war office has been notified that the British had five killed and twenty five wounded in the sortie from Kimber ley November 2 .Slncludlng' three coloni al officers. It Is reported from Orange River today that 107 dead Boers were taken to ICaffirkop after' the battle of Belmont. OOIIPAUT. WANTS ANOTHER TIGnT Special dispatches from j Lorenzo Mar quez, dated Tuesday, December 5, says President Kruger Is only prevented from going .to the front by thl objections of the members of the executive council.

Advices from Pretoria Eay the govern ment forwarded two cablegrams to Win ston Churchill. The mint at Pretoria Is coining a hundred thousand sovereigns monthly. According to a dispatch from General Schalkburger's laager, dated December 3, the French and Australian and Aus trian military attaches had arrived there, while the German attaches had gone to join the Boer forces along the Tugela river, where a collision was momen tarily expected. , 

BOER STORIES THE TUGELA BRIDGE Pretoria, Dec. 6. Official dispatches re ceived here from the different Boer forces say all is quiet except at Kimber ley, where an armored train made a sor tie this morning. The Orange Free State has proclaimed the annexation of Dord recht, about fifty miles north of Queens town. Capo Colony. The Tugela bridge, It is also announced, is so completely ruined that it will be a work of great magnitude for either belligerent to re store it. The British fired on some re publican scouts south of the Tugela this morning. There wero no casualties. A newspaper correspondent named Lynch, who entered the Boer lines at Ladysmith on Monday, with the alleged purpose of exchanging newspapers, has been mado a prisoner and will (be brought to Pre toria. LADYSMITH NEWS TO DATE Frera Camp, Natal, Wednesday, Dec 7. The runner from Ladysmith today reports all well.

SAYS HE IS PREJUDGED Defies His Opponents to Pro duce Legal Proof. "Washington, Dec. 7. Brigham H. Rob erts of Utah, who was not allowed to be sworn in as a representative in congress of that state, has issued an address to the American people. It contains much that was said by Mr. Poberts on the floor of the house, and by Mr. Richardson, who opposed the resolution of Mr. Tayler of Ohio. After reviewing the facts and pro ceedings resulting in the appointment of the committee, ho says: "The member from Utah is not allowed to take the oath of his office, and a committee is appointed to try him as to his alleged guilt of the oenses charged. Nay, even more is granted than was ask ed, at least more than was asked upon the floor of this house. For a hostile committee has been appointed to inquire into the case. Its membership Is made up entirely of those who voted to adopt the method of procedure. Not one who voted against it wis allowed to find a place upon that committee and If the creation of such a tribunal for such a purpose be allowed, there Is no reason why the committee should not be made up of members of one political faith for the majority may do as it pleases about that. "I ask the American people to stop and think what that may mean to this coun try in! times of high political excitement and party strife and passion. "First A formidable minority In the house may be reduced either to a very insignificant minority, or even blotted out of oxlstenco. "Second The representation to which a state Is entitled on the floor of the house may be denied to it as in this Utah case for any length of time this committee may elect to deny It such representation. Suppose that in this case the committee shall see proper to proceed with reason able expedition to consider the questions Involved, but what is there to hinder de laying its action under one pretext or an other as long as It pleases. It may take a week, a month, or a year, to make its investigations, for it is authorized to send for papers and persons, to examine wit nesses and Is not eve ninstructed to re port at as early a dato as possible. It can prolong its investigations for two years as well as a month or a year, if It so elects, and meantime deny to a state, repreesntation and may defeat altogether the expressed will of a people of a state as to their choic of a representative. If the present Republican house can thus depurive Utah of her representation, there is no Teason why it could not deny Vir ginia hers, even though she has ten rep resentatives, for ten representatives as easily as one can be turned away from the bar of the house and one state ns well as another, if a bare majority in the house chooses to have it so, and if the present Republican .house can do this in the case of Utah or Virginia, there is no reason why tho next Democratic house could not proceed In like manner with representatives from Republican states under this new and unprecedented rule of procedure. "Third This new precedent also strikes down the "constitutional guarantee of a right, to one accused of crime, to aspeedy and public trial by an impartial Jury of the state wherein the crime shall have been committed. The proposition is not to deprive me of my seat in congress by the presentation of records of conviction for crime before courts before which I have been found guilty under the due forms of law. The proposition 1b to try me before the committee of the house, to send for persons and paper, and wit nesses to ascertain my guilt or innocence of an alleged misdemeanor, reported to have been committed in Utah. It will be useless to deny this statement by saying that in the charge against me, which re sulted in the appointment of this extra ordinary committee of investigation, it is said that a transcript of the proceedings of a court in Utah evidences the fact that the member from Utah pleaded guilty to a' misdemeanor in the year iSSt ten years ago. and when Utah ws a territory. Whatever political disabilities were cre ated by that event were removed by th sovereign state of Utah when, in the ad option of her state constitution. In 15, she. by her sovereign power, declared what should be the qualifications of ber electoral, and I possess them alL And this side of the enabling act and the ad mission of Utah I am at the defiance of my enemies to produce any court record of conviction for crime or at any Unto since the misdemeanor of HS9. and the house has so right to proceed on any other evidence than such court record. "I deny the existence of the lawful power o( the bouse to prevent me from being sworn tn on the presentation of the same evidence of prima fade risrht upon which others are admitted: o mTnberabip I deny the right of the house of repre sentatives to resolve its'f Inoi jut!c of the peace court, to try me fr a mis demeanor, alleged to have been com mitted, in order to and grounds of x palrikra or exclusion from the high offic to wbl-h I was elected.

"It is truo that the representative from Utah is a 'Mormon' and just now against the Mormon people a wave of popular sentiment, created by falsehood, chiefly by the charge that Utah has broken her compact with the United States in the matter of polygamy; that her people contemslate the removal of polygamous marriages; that the seating of Utah's representative would ba ro garded by her Mormon population as an endorsement of polygamy, and would be a menace to the American home. Upon my honor as a representative from the state of Utah a man in whom the state of Utah has reposed their confidence, both non-Mormons as wel las Mormons, I solemnly deny thoao charges. They are not true. The only thing charge able to some few men In the state of Utah Is that they have not deserted the plural wives thoy married years ago. previous to the settlement of tho .polyg amy question between the government of the United States and Utah by which polygamous or plural marriages are for ever prohibited. In the state of Utah, a penalty affixed by constitutional provis ion and the whole made repealable without the consent of the United States and the consent of the people of Utah. "Even continuing tho relations formed before this settlement of the question, before the disruption was either demand ed by the enabling act or contemplated in the provisions of the state constitu tionare under tlie law a misdemeanor and punishable; but it has not been re garded as necessary to good morals or public policy, to prosecute people for this offense and neither by the Republi can party or by Democrats has the exis tence of such relations been considered a bar to political preferment until the political and religious enemies of the present representative from Utah thought proper to urge them against him. But such men have been sleeted to offices of high honor in tho stats of Utah and othc-s against whom such charges were made by affidavit ware ap pointed to federal offices In the state, notwithstanding such objections were urged against them. I submit to you tb question, whether it Is worth while for your representatives in the lower house of congress to Break down the safe guards which protect both the rights of individuals and the rights of the states and which menaces representative gov ernment Itself In the states I ask is It worth while to countenance nroedors involving dangers herein set forth.
