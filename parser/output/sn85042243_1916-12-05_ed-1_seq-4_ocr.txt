Unfinished business is the chief topic of President Wilson's message. Congress adjourned before the elec­ tions with many problems unsolved. Phases of the Adamson eight-hour bill come back to haunt the members and are reminders of the disgraceful way in which the legislation was jammed through at the Eleventh hour. President Wilson admits that freight rates must be increased, if the eight-hour legislation is to become effective in the operation of a railroad. It means more crews, a larger pay­ roll and a general revamping of oper­ ating methods. With the campaign behind instead of confronting him, President Wilson approaches the wage situation on a different plane. He puts it up to Con­ gress. There are no emphatic de­ mands, jbecause the chief executive knows, he is addressing a body, a large number of which will retire to private life next March. President Wilson reiterates his rev ommendatioit of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and wages in the employment of all rail wajfemplbyes lie wisely shifts. the burden of working out-a feasible plan, to the interstate |ommerce commis­ sion. This will entail a thorough adminis­ trative'reorganization of the commis­ sion'" c' Few can doubt the wisdom .'of askf ing Congress to give the federal gov­ ernment power to take over the rail­ roads when military necessity de­ mands. Some might wiBh that President Wilson had urged compuUury arbitra­ tion of labor disputes compulsion as (binding on capital as labor. Arbitra­ tion is urged, it is true, bur the chief executive is general, not specific, in his recommendations. But the mes­ sage is explicit enough to spur Con­ gress to some action that will make It impossible for strikes and lockouts to paralyze the industrial organization uf the nation. The President closes his message with an appeal to clear away all legal obstacles toward the development of our export trade. It is proposed to permit combinations and to stimulate concerted action to buiM up foreign trade, which is hardly possible under the present federal laws. 

UNIVERSAL TRAINING. Don't lose sight of the difference be­ tween universal military service and universal military training! Whatever you inay think of the pro­ posal that all citizens be required to defend this country when necessary, you can find no legitimate excuse for opposition to the training of young men and boys in the manual of arms, in riflecraft and erect hearing, to the end that if called upon they can de­ fend themselves and their future fam­ ilies both in peace and in civil life. 'Military training does not make a man a militarist, any more than an ability to defend himself with his fists turns him into a pugilist. Universal training will give the United States a finer foody of young 'manhood than it now possesses. Incidentally, it will raise the moral I standard of the nation. ... Square-shouldered fellows "who know woodcraft and are physically fit do not loll in front of poolrooms, with cigarettes drooping from their lips, to leer at girls and insult women as they pass. The man with a democratic mili­ tary training, such as Switzerland gives its citizens, looks the world in the eye and knows no /nan as mas­ ter. Far from promoting subserviency in men, training such as is given at Plattsbarg and other civilian training camps increases their efficiency, makes them independent and able to care for themselves, improves their health and impresses them with the value of concerted'action.

THE PROBLEM OF "SPObNIlNG." Matrons of maternity homes and others, interested in tHe problem of the illegitimate child have said many times that flippancy with regard to ''fellows" and •"spooning1" starts many a good girl on the path to disgrace. .luBt at present the usual amount of gayety in every/ large city renews the general interest in statements of this kind. A round of dances, "joy ritftis, plays and picture shows promotes a girl's opportunities for making new acquaintances and offers chances for Informal and sometimes very doubtful friendships between nice young wo­ men and men who are unknown to the family of the young woman. Then the influence of the home will show itself and will iprove the vital factor in determining a girl's conduct under temptation. Over one-third of the unwed mothers whose cases were investigated in a certain city were living with their parents or relatives. Evidently, fathers and mothers mu&t assume greater responsibility for the conduct of their daughters, is the conclusion most persons will make. But how about the parents' respon­ sibility tor their sons' conduct? 'A man whose parents have trained him in decency will see that his spooning never robs a girl of her re­ spectability. Isn't it about time that such ques­ tions were discussed as a man-and woman problem and not entirely as *a matter of the education of girls? Backache (By L. H. Smith, M. D.) In spite of the best care one takes of oneself, any part of the human ma­ chine is liable to become out of or­ der. -The most important organs are .the stomach, heart and kidneys. The'kidneys are the scavengers and they work day and night in separat­ ing the poisons from the blood. Their signals of distress are easily recog­ nized and include such symptoms as backache, depressions, drowsiness, ir ritabHity. headaches, dizziness, rheu­ matic twinges, dropsy, gout. The very best way to restore the kidneys to their normal state is to drink plenty of pure water and ob tain a small amount of Anuric, which is dispensed by almost every drug­ gist. Anuric is inexpensive and should be taken before meals. It is much more potent than lithia and many find that Anuric dissolves uric acid as water does sugar. People are realizing more and more every day that the kidneys, just as do the bowels, need to be flushed occa­ sionally. The kidneys are an elimina tive organ and are constantly work­ ing, separating the poisons from the blood. Under this continual and per­ petual action they'are apt to congest, and :then trouble starts Uric acid backs up into the system, causing rheumatism,, neuralgia dropsy and many other serious disturbances. It means that you are a victim to uric acid poisoning. Then ask your drug­ gist for Anuric, which was first dis­ covered by Dr. Tierce of the Surgical Institute in Buffalo, and which is dis­ pensed by nearly every druggist in the land.

Railway Troubles First I then recommended: First,' immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor­ ganization of the Interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the bill recently passed by the house of representatives and now -awaiting action by the senate In order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various duties sow devolving upon It with a prompt­ ness and thoroughness which are, with Its present constitution and means of action, practically Impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work an£ of wages in the employ­ ment of all railway employees who are actually engaged In the work of oper­ ating trains In Interstate transporta­ tion. Third, the authorization of the ap­ pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re­ sults fn experience of the adoption of the eight-hour 0dy In railway trans­ portation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by thecon fress of the consideration by the In­ terstate commerce commission of an Increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail­ roads as may, luve been rendered nec­ essary by the* aniiption of ttie eight hour day andA«^hb!h have not been off­ set by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis­ closed justify th£ Increase. Fifth, an amendment of the. existing federal statute whith provides, for the mediation, conciliation and arbitration of such controversies as the' present by adding to It a provision that, in case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public Investigation' of the merits of every •ueh dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment In the hands of the executive of the power, In case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll­ ing stfck of the railroads of the coun­ try as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the/ United States such tralrfi crews and adminis­ trative officials (fui the circumstances require fprr£helr safe and efficient use.

The fourth rec­ ommendation do not deem it neces­ sary to renew. The,power of the In­ terstate commerce commission to grant an increase of rates on the ground ret ferred to Is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw In question the scope of the com aisqion'B authority or its Inclination to & flo justice when there Is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions—the Increase In the interstate commerce commis­ sion's membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail* ways when necessai? in tim^ of war or other like public necessity—I now very earnestly renews The neiiesslty for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Those whq have intrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them In such matters would'find it bard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Mot only does the interstate com­ merce commission now find it practi­ cally impossible, with its present mem­ bership and organization, to perform Its grea): functions promptly and thor­ oughly, but It is not unlikely that It may presently be found advisable to add to Its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative lustra orient The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra­ tion and conciliation which the con­ gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu­ tive to make Immediate and uninter­ rupted use of the railroads for the con­ centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed.

To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before re­ ceiving the approval of society In do­ ing so would be to adopt a new prin­ ciple Into our jurisprudence which I take it for granted we are not prepared to introduce. But the .proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or inter­ rupted by the concerted action of or­ ganised bodies of men until a publle Investigation shall have been Instituted which shall make the whole question at Issue plain for the'Judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the con­ certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not'be permitted to stop the in­ dustrial processes of the. nation, at ady rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity'.^o acquaint itself with the merits of the 'case as between em­ ployee and employer, time to form Its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con­ sider all practicable means of concilia­ tion or arbitration. I can see' nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so­ ciety of the necessary processes of Its very life. There is nothing arbi trary or unjust in it unless It be arbl trarlfy and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full-and scrupu-. ious regard for the interests and liber­ ties of all concerned as well as" for the permanent Interests of society Itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital importance await the'action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination- to those engaged in pro­ moting .the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some tO le legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly the bill amending the ji^esent organic law of/Porto Rico and. the bill proposing a more thor­ ough ftnd systematic Regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, com monlj. called the Corrupt Practices Act I 'need not labor my advice that these measures be Enacted into law. Their urgency lies in tfee manifest circum­ stances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces­ sary. Even delay would seriously jeopard the interests of the couctrj[ and of the government.
