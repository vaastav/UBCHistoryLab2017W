Clvtl-Horvlo < Reform. In a f ormor message I invited tho attention of Congress to the subject of the reformation of the civil service of the Government, aud expressed the intention of fiansmitiing to Con gress, as early as practicable, a report upon this subject by the Chairman of the Civil He- v ice Commission. In view of the fact that during a cxv s'.iorable period the Government of Great Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and abuses in various particulars analagous to those present ed in this country end that, in recent years, tho measures lulojrtoi were understood to have been effective ami iu every respect highly sat isfactory, 1 thought it desirable to have fuller information up.si tho subj-ct, and accordingly requested the Chairman of the Civil Hcrvi o Commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. Tho insult has boon an elab orate and comprehensive report The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils sys tem in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the Parliamentary patronage, and of of ficial interference with tho freedom of elections. It shows that, after long trials of various kinds of examina tions, those which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are car nedon under the superintendence of a tingle commission, have with great advantage been established as conditions of admission to almos’ every official (and ice in the subordinate adminis tration of that country and of British India. The completion of Use report, owing to the cx tent of the labor involved in its preparation, and the omission of Congrt se to make any provis ion either f >r tho compensation or the expenses of the conimi-nu, has been postponed until the present tune. It is herewith transmitted to Congress. While tlsj measures of anottier Government are of no an h >nty for us, they are entitled to influence to the extent vo which their intr nsic wisdom and their adaptation to our institutions and s.cial life mav commend th* mto out consideration The views I hsve heretofore ex jessed ooncomiug the defects and abuses in our civil administration remain unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged ex periouce has opened my souse of the duty both of officers and of the jieop'e th-mselves to cu operate foe th'jr removal.

In the light of these principles it becomes, of gn at importance to provide just and adequate meat s. especially f, r every department and largo adminstialive of fice, where personal di-crimination on the pari of its hea ) is not practicable for ascertaining those qualifications to which appointment* 1 and removals should have reference. To fail to provide su£h means is not on y to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depend, but of necessity to discourage all worthy aspirants by banding over appoint ments ana removals to mere influence and favoritism. If it ;s the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment, and the in terest of the people to bestow it upon him, it would seem clear that a wise ami just method of ascertaining person al fitnesa for office must needs be an important and permanent function of every just and wise novernment. It has long since Income impossible in the great offices for these having the du'y of nomination and appoint ment to personally examine into the individual qualifications of more than a small proportii n of those seeking office, and with the enlarge ment of civil service that proportion must con tinue to become ie-s. In the earlier years of the Government the subordinate offices were s few in number that it wan easy for those mak ingap;Mjintmonts and p.emotions to personally j a-> cj tain the merits of the candidates, j Party managers and methods had then ; liecome powerful agents of coercion hoe ! tile to the free and just exercise ot | tho appointing power. A large and j responsible pari of tho duty of restoring the civil service to ho desired purity and efficiency rest* upon the President; ami it has been my purpose to do what is within my powi r to ad vance such prudent and gradual measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that rath 'a! change of system essential - to make our administrative me hods saiislae- j ton - to a free and intelligent jsicp' by a pioper : exeicise of authority. It is in .no power of j the Executive to do much to promote such a reform, but it cannot bo too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplish* and | without co-operation on the part of Congress ; and considerate and intelligent support among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally-accepted theories of parties and demand changes in the methods of departments ai e not the work of a day. Their permanent foundation must he laid in sound principb s and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adver saries. Every worthy officer desires to make his oflictal action an honor to his country. But tee people themsi Ives, far more than their ofll cers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical, and vigorous admin istration. By laws enacted in 18IW and 1g.0.5. and now in substance incorporated in the Revised tßatutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the several subordinate grades in tho great departments was condemned, and examinations as to capacity, to be conducted by the Departmental Hoards of Examiners, were provided for and made conditions of ad mission to the public service. Those statutis are a decision by Congress that examinations of soman >rt as to attainments and capacity are essential to the well-being of the public ser vice. The important questions since the en actment of the-e laws have Iroen as to the char aider of these examinations, and whether offi cial favor and partisan influence or com mon right and merit were to control tho access to the examinations. In practice these examinations have not always been open to worthy persons generally who might wish to be examined. Official favoritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before theexaminiog boards, su'Joeing even the exam iners to a pressure from the friends of the can didates very difficult to resist. Asa conse quence, the standard* of admiseion fell below tnat which the public inter* st demanded. It was almost inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of examiners, with no com mon supervision or uniform method of procedure, should result in confusion, in consistency, and inadequate tests of capacity highly detrimental to tho public interest. A further and more radical change was obviously required, lit the annual mm-ssge of December, 1870, my predecessor declared that “there is no duly which so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of on .dily investigate flic scope ami character of the tests, and tho method of determining Ihe results, ami these visitors have, without excep tion, approved the modes employed, and several of them have publialy attested their favorable opinion. Upon such considerations, I deem it my duty to renew the recommenda tion contained ui my annual message of Decem ber, 1877, requesting Congress to make the necessary appropriations for the resumption of the work of the Civil Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a departments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and than kies.* labor im posed on Senators and Representatives as Ilia' of finding places for constituents. The pres ent system does not secure the best men, and often not oven fit men, foi the public places. The elevation and pnrili cation of the civi : service ef the Government will be hailed with approval hv tho whole pe pie of the Cubed HtVos. ” Congress accord mgly passe*! tho *ct approved il arch 15, 1871, “To regulate the irivil service of the United S'ates ai *1 promote the efficiency thereof,” giv tug the neoes-ary authority to the Executive to insulate a civil service reform. Acting under tliis statute, which was interpreted as intended to secure a system of just and eifectual e:.ami nations under uniform supervision, a uumbei of eminently competent persons were select*- for tho purpose, who entered w ith zeal upon the and -charge of their duties, prepared with an in tclligent appreciation of the r* quiremeutsef the * vice, toe regulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who, in h. ir o iparity as a board, h ive been known as the Civil ,-wrvico Commission. Congress for two years appropriated the money lie* ded for vh* c mponaatiou and fir the expense of carrying on the work of the commission, it nppeam from th • report of ihe commission, sr.li.nit e t j tue President in April, l s 7, that examin.*- tioiis l.ad been hehl in various sections of iln country, and that m appropriation of about STipM'i would be reqmr* 1 to meet the annua' ox enses, lucltlihtig sa anes, involve*! h. discharging The duties cf the commis sion. The report was transmitted to C ingress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the following favorable common upon the la I sirs c-f the commission: “If sus tained by Congress, I have no doubt the nil s can,after the experience gained, hose improved aud enforced as to slid more materially benefit the public service,’and relieve the Executive, members of Congress, and the heads of dt pailinen's Mom influences prejudicial to go and id..jiiJis(rat]ou, The rules, as they have hith erto tieen enforced, have resulted beneficially, as is tftiown by the opinions of the memoers oc the Cabinet’ aud their subordinat* sir. tho departments, and in that opinion i concur. And in the annual message ot De- ember of the same year s.milar views are expressed, and an appropriation for continuing Uit work *if the commission again advise 1. The appropriation was not made, and, as a c*>u sequence, the active work of the commissi u was suspou led, leaving the commission bsel still in existence w ithout the means therefore of dosing qualifications to be tested in any-js temafic manner, or securing fer tbe public set vice the advantages or competition upon any ex'o isivo plan. I recommended in my annum message or December 1877, the making of an appropriation for tie resumption of tb* work of the commission. In vne moan time, however, comoetitlvo examinations, under many embarrassments, have t*eea conducted within limited spheres in the executive dopart m, nJi in Washington, nd in a number of the custom houses and po-t filccs of the principal cmis of the country, with a view to further test their effects, amt in every instance they have been found to boas salutary as they are j stated to have been under tbe administration i of my predecessor, 1 tliink the economy, 1 puri:> and ili iency of the public service i would be great y promoted by their systematic . i itroductioii, wherever practicable, throughout \ tbe entire civil service of the Government, together wilh ample provision for tin ir general supervision, in order to secure consistency and i uniform justice. Reports from tbe Secretary of the Interior, i from the Postmaster Get' raf, from the Post master in the city of New York, where such examinations have been some lime on trial, and also from the Collector of the Port, the Nava. Officer and the Purveyor in that city, and from the Postmasters and Collectors in seviralof the other large cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, lias in various ways contributed to imurove the pub ic service. Tbe reports show that the results have lieen salutary in a market! degree, and that the general appbcatiou , f similar rules cannot fail to bo of decided benefit to the service. The reports of the Government officers in the city of Now York especially boar decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations in their respo, t ive otliees, showing that those examination*, and the tx.'client qualifications of those admit ted to the service through them, have had a marked incidental effi ci upon the persona pre vious y in die service, ami particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There hue been on the part of those Utter an increased inter-I est in the work, and a desire to extend aoquaint auce with it lieyoud a particular desk, and thus tlie morale of the entire force has been raised The examiuatioue have been attended by many citizens, wlio have had an opportunity to Gut modulate compensation to persons in the nub ile service who may perform extra labor upon or under the commission as the Executive may direct. lam convinced that if a just at id defiiite test of merit is enforced for admission to the public service, and in making promotions, such abuses as removal without good cause and parlisan and otli cial interference with the proper exorcise of the appointing power will in large measure disappear. There are other administrative abuses to which tne attention of Congress should bo asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointment and the constant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbing and mischievous political activity on the part of those thus appointed, w hich not only intern res with the dun discharge of ofti cisl duty, but is incompatible with the freedom of elections. Not without warrant in the viw of several of my predecessors in the Presiden tial office, directly in accordance with the law of 1871 already cited, 1 endeavored, by regulation made on the !£id of June, 1*77, to put some reasonable limits to such abuses. It may not be easy, and it may never, perhaps, Ist necessary to define with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of T< deral officers. But, while their right to hold and freely express thnir opinions cannot he nuns turned, it is very plain that they should neither bo allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the proper discharge of their official duties, nor to nse the authority of their office to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the political acton of those who hold different opinions. Reasons of justice and public jailicy quite analogous to those which forbid the nse of official power for the oppression of the pri vate citizen impose upon the Government tho duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect con sidored, the practice of making levies for party purposes upon the salaries of officers is highly demoralizing to the public s Trice and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free any other citizen io give his money m aid of las opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any othei citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the officers, it is gross injiis tice to levy tax upon them, if they are mat o excessive in order that they may hi at the tax, the excess is an indirect robbery of the public funds. 1 recommend, therefore, such a re vision and extension of the present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public employment the protection with which a great and enlightened nation shad guard those who are faithful in its service.

It may leasonaMy l*e anticipated that the commission now sitting in Washington for the decision of private cases in tins connection will soon be al ls to bring iia Übors to a conclusion. The lot g standing question of the East Florida elanns has lately been renewed as a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require Congressional action for its dual disposition. A treaty with the Netherlands with respect to Consular rights and privileges similar to those with other p wets has l> eu signed and ratified, ami the ratifications were exchanged on the 111 at of July last. Negotiations for extradition treaties with the Netherlands and with Denmark ir now in progress. Home questions with Switzerland in regard to pauper and convict emigrants hare arisen, but ii is not doubted that they will bo arranged upon a just and satisfactory basis, a question lias also occurred with respect to an asserted claim by Hwiss municipal authorities to exercise tub 1 ago over the persons and property of S-.m-s citt Zens naturalize lin this Country It is possible this may require adjustment by treaty.

If pros) only should attend tin* enterprise of its traus|>orta ti 11 across Uie Atlantic, its erection in a con spicuous position m the chief comm* rciai city of the nation will be soon accomplished. The treaty recently made b twiou Japan and the United Slates in regard to the revision of former treaties, it is now believed, will lie fol lowed by “tratlar action on the part of other treaty powers. 'The attention of Congress is again invited to the B'.ibjert of the indemnity funds received some years since from Japan and China, which, with their accumulated in to rest, now amount to considerable sums. If < any part of these funds is justly due to American citi ns. they *ht nl I receive it i promptly, and whatever may have been re ! ceiveil by the Government in excess of strict- 1 I v just demands should in some form bo re t turned to the nations to whom it equitably | belongs. The Government of China has signified its willingness to consider the question of the emigration of its snbjccU to •no United States with a dispassionate fairness ami to co-operate in such measure as nta\ tend 0 prevent injurious consequences to the United 1 oistes. The negotiations are still proceeding, | and will be pressed with diligence. A question having arisen between China and Japan alxiut the Looclico islands, the United Hlat s Govern ment has taken measures to inform those pow ers of its rea-diness to extend its good offl-cs for the maintenance of peace, If they shall mu tually deem it desirable and ft lx I it practicable to avail themselves of the proffer. It is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the judicious and energetic ac turn of the military command,on of the two nations on each side ol the Km Grande, miner the instructions of their respective Govern ments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, and, in localities where they were formerly destructive, have now almost wholly ceased. ' lu view of this result, I entertain a confident expectation of the continuance of the prevalence of quiet on the border of the two countries. The third installment of the award against Mexico under the Claims Commission of July 4, ISOs, was duly paid, and has been put in course of distribution in pursuance of the set of Congress providing for the same. This sat isfactory situation between the two countries leads me to anticipate an expansion of onr trade with Mexico, and ini increased contribution of capital and industry by onr people to the devel opment of the great resources of that country. 1 earnestly commend to the wisdom of Con gress the provision of mutable legldation look ing to this result iMplomatio intercourse with Colombia is again fully restored by the arrival of the Min inter from that country to the United States Tliis is especially fortunate in view of the fact that the question of an interoooanie canal has recently assumed an imisirtant aspect, and is now under discussion with the Central Aineri can countries, through whose territory the canal by the Nicaragua route would have to pass.
