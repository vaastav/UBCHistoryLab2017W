of the demagogue Pro8ldcnt RaoB6veHln d hIgh place demonstrates the experI I > ence of every honest man These two j are his Scylla and CharybdIsthey are to him as the davll and the deep blue sea He says The triumph ofI I 4 1 the mob Js just as evil a thing as the triumph of the plutocracy lOne hates e the corrupUonlsts but In the same measure ha despises the preachers i of mere discontent Earnestly striv ing to unhorse the former he arouses 1 j the other who seek to excite a vlo lont class hatred Roosevelt Is hon ii cst with what Alfred Henry Lewis I j calls a militant honesty Some men i tt f shrink from dishonesty The Roose t veil typo goes out to meet It and I give It battle For this reason ho I must speak out against wrong wher I t ever he sees It and when ho does he finds The sinister demagogues who 1 sometimes seek to associate them selves with those working for a gen y uine reform Thus we find him In j his message to congress pointing out drastic measures of radical reform nnd preaching conservatism striking i a blow at corruption and spurning the demagogue Roosevelt Is a re I v former In every thing but unlike l many who would remedy conditions i the presence of corruption In a boJy V r does not condemn the whole matter In his ayes He is more like a good 0 surgeon bent on removing the evil sand s giving mho good part a chance to heal over This marks him a con t structive not a destructive reformer Many good men there are In politics many more good men than bad But r there Is ono In a million with the courage to undertake reforms not because they fear the opposition uf r f those they must attack but because they fear the yawping pack of dema i tr gogues who revel in I destruction for K ° destructions sake This disposition of Roosevelt to do > things and do them conservatively fearless of the prpte ts of those ho hurts and heedless of the dumands r of the visionaries behind has In i duced him to treat us to an unusual t amount ot preaching about plain Moral propositions and his latest T meswgo to congress Is I no exception Oh the gufition of capital and Tabor J ho qnyV the visionaries who t1o are frenzied by demagoguery would bring about 9

tt1t ther that base creature who ap peals and panders to tho lowest Instincts and passions In order to arouse one set of Americans against their fellows or that other creature equally base but no baser who In a spirit of greed or to accumulate or add to an already huge fortuna seeks to exploit his fellow Am ericans with callous disregard to their welfare of soul and body Concerning lynching he says De It remembered further more that the individuals who whether from folly from evil tomporfrora greed for office or in n spirit of mere base dema gogy Indulge In the Inflamma tory and Incendiary speeches and writings which tend to arouse hobs andto bring about lynching not only thus exclto theimob but also tend by what criminologists call suggestion greatly to Increase the likeli hood of n repetition of the very t crime against which they are inveighing Again he says j In enacting and enforcing such legislation as this con greas already has to Its credit we are working on a coherent plan with the steady endeavor to secure the needed reform by the joint action of the moderate men the plain men who do not i Oti i wish anything hysterical or dan goroua but who do Intend to deal In resolute commonsense fashion with the real and great evils of the present system The reactionaries and the vlo lent extremists show symptoms of joining hands against us Both assert for ktnstancethat If logical twe should gQ to gov government and tho like the reactionaries because on such an Issue they think the people would stand with them while the extremists care rather to preach dlscbntent and agitation than to achieve solid results Asa Matter of fact our position Is as remote from that of the Bourbon reac tionary as from that of the im practicable or sinister visionary We hold that the
