Wllaem 8aya Ik la All Right, Springer Tfelnka It Is Forcible. Dlngtey Calls It Wearteeane, and Hoar Saya It la Reaara abto Gcawtml Harrlaoa Will Mot Talk. Washington, Dec &. It is not often (hat the public awaits a president mes sage with the intense interest which haa been manifested in the document just sent to congress. The reading was listened to with close attention in both houses, and at its close a number of pertfneut and inter esting interviews were bad with members. Ex -Speaker Reed said: "I dislike to com ment on the message because it would not be seemly to do it in adequate terms. It is exceedingly disappointing both in mat ter and manner. It is largely made np ot a wearisome resume of the reports of his secretaries, aud they have hardly been im proved by condensation. On the Hawaiian question we are left as much in the dark as ever and must wait the news of the next steamer, just as we have been waiting so long. That part of the message which re lates to the tariff is most surprising. It asseverates that the house committee in charge of that subject has formulated plans and devised methods of taxation which, as a member. I have not even heard proposed. "It is a rather unusual sensation to learn of the deed of the committee, not in the committee room, but from the president of the United States, lias that committee ceased even in form to be composed of both parties, and has it without even the for mality of a word in open committee in formed the president of its determination in such way that the president can officially communicate it to the house? "How long has it been part of our sys tem that the committee of an independent branch, and above all the committee which controls the purse, shall report to congress through the president? Is this the result of the rumored blending of the appointive with the legislative power? It is bad enough to have a tariff bill made up by a little co terie 'political bill, as Mr. Wilson calls it but to have it communicated to the presi dent before it reaches even the committee, stiil less the house, shows a determination to be moved by no faces and modified by no arguments, which makes apparent the ab surdity of appointing Republicans on the committee of ways and means at all times.1' Mr. Springer Commands It. Mr. Springer of Illinois of the banking and currency committee of the present con gress said: "In reference to the tariff the message is clear and forcible. The p resi dent does not enter into an elaborate dis cussion of the subject, but recommends a complete compliance with demands of the American people for tariff reform. In this the message will receive the cordial com mendation of every Democrat in the land and of many others who realize that our present protective system is injurious to the best interests of the people. In reference to Hawaii the president takes the only i course which is consistent with Interna j tionnl honor and comity. j Mr. Holmau of Indiana: "It is an able i and foible document. The earnest sug i gestions of economy contrast strongly with messages heretofore presented." Chairman Wilson of the ways and means committee: "The president's message is all right. He is especially right on the tariff.1 Mr. Tracey of New York: "I am satisfied with it. It is a good message. Mr. Gear of Iowa, member of the com mittee on ways and means: "The president says that he will restore LiHuoknJani, gives the majority of the ways and means committee away on the income tax and agrees with Hancock that the tariff is a local issue and asks the people not to kick' Mr. Bynum of Indiana, member of the ways aud means committee: "It was a very concise but clear statement of the multi tude of questions congress will be called upon to consider. Some sections I would like to read more carefully, but the princi pal views presented meet my unqualified approval. I am especially pleased with the tariff question and the courageous manner in which the president came to the support of the committee, as tariff reform could not be accomplished without the support of the administration. Mr. Payne DUappolnted. Mr. Payne of New York, member of the ways and means committee: "The message is a remarkably disappointing document. It is mainly devoted to a resume of the re ports of the several departments to which the president seldom adds an opinion of his own. On important matters it gives little information. On Hawaiian affairs it gives us no information. His announce ment of the internal revenue feature of the plau of the ways and means committee la astounding. This is the first information the minority members have had that any conclusion has been reached. If reports are correct, the people of London are In formed on this important matter much earlier than members of the committee. The question now seems to be whether all legislation must originate at the White Hous" Mr. Dingley of Maine: "The message is voluminous and wearisome in its recapitu lation of the smaller incidents of the mi nutest questions which have arisen in our foreign affairs, but on the one great foreign question of which congress as well as the country ought to know the exact situa tion tow it, our relations with Hawaii the message is as silent as the grave.' Mr. UalEell of Pennsylvania, member of the ways and means committee: "It would seem that the president has not yet heard the news from Massachusetts, New xork, Pennsylvania, Ohio aud Iowa. When he refers to the reduction of tariff charges on the necessaries of life, I suppose he has ref erence to champagne and brandy. It seems like cruel sarcasm on the part of the presi dent to speak of the benefit to result to the wage earner from free raw materials when we come to consider the thousands of men that will be homeless, hungry and desper ate when the coal and the ore mines of this country are shut np for the benefit of the foreigner. On the whole, he must be a most devoted admirer of the president who can find In the message any strengthening of the Democratic position on the tariff question." Hoar Calls It Remarkable. Senator Hoar: "It was a most remark able message in several respects. It treats the important questions affecting the wel fare of the country feebly and briefly. It is verbose, dull and diffuse in giving de tails and uuim port ant facts concerning the departments. 'The imputation of the president con cerning civil service reform, to the effect that the law was enacted because of fear of public opinion and not because of the con viction of the legislators who enacted it, is without precedent. This reflection comes with an til grace from a president who has dealt as the existing nresideut has dealt with the consular service of the United States without even tnkiug the advice of his secretary of state and whose appoint ment of Van Alen has been such an offense to the country's sense of decency. Mr. Bou telle of .Maine: "It is the first executive document which directly im pugned and charged malfeasance in office and practically treason upon a United Btates minister against whom nothing was charged by the administration up to the time his resignation was accepted. The people of London may be aware of the pol icy which the ruler of the United States pursues and his authority for making war. tearing down and putting np governments, but we are not. Senator Voorhees: "In the main the measure la a sound, strong document. I have not examined it critically and cannot go into closer criticism. I think tt will be well received by the country.'" . A number of other senators, moat of wTftoi ware Democrats, were seen, but de tained to express their views. Among these were Sherman of Ohio, Aldrlch of Bhode Island, Hill of New York, Daniel of Virginia, Mills of Texas, Coke of Texas, Jones of Arkansas, Cockrell of Missouri, Smith of New Jersey, Harris of Tennessee and Walthall of Mississippi Praised by Londoa Papers. London, Dec N early all the morning papers today speak of President Cleveland's message in highly complimentary terms. The Daily Graphic says: "Mr. Cleveland is to be congratulated upon his firmness and consistency.' The Times says: "The message exhibits clear and well reasoned views of policy in addition to much force of character. The portions of the message bearing upon for eign affairs are conceived in a highly cred itable spirit. Considering the chauvinism of our American kinsfolk, it is the more creditable that the president has frankly admitted the wrong done to Hawaii.' The Daily News says: "The message is well worthy of the national crisis in which it is delivered." Harrlaoa oa the Meaiaga. Indianapolis, Dec 5. Kx-President Harrison, when asked if he had read the president's message, replied that he had just finished its perusal, but declined to talk upon it for publication. The impropriety of an ex-president dis cussing publicly a president's message," said he, "is very palpable, and I do not care to do so. I am a Republican, and Presi dent Cleveland is a Democrat; consequent ly we differ radically iu our views and opinions, aud his suggestions and recom mendations are not iu accordance with my ideas. I notice, however, that he goes down the line of the departments and treats of them fully. Its length, too. Is greater than the average message.' A 

LIVELY CHURCH WAR. Cardinal Gibbon iUckr a Prlost Against His Pollah Flock. Baltimore, Dec. 5. Cardinal Gibbons got out an injunction against certain mem bers of the Polish Catholic church of this city in favor of its pastor, the Rev. Miecxy law Barabasz, restraining them from in terfering with the collections of house rents, pew rents, school fees, Sunday col lections, etc, and also from interfering with the pastor in the discharge of his duty. Father Barabasz is not popular with some of the congregation; hence the trou ble. He was appointed by Cardinal Gib bons some 15 months ago and took full charge of the affairs of the pastorate, much to the chagrin of a committee who had been attending to money matters of the church under the former pastor. Several fights have occurred between the members of the congregation and have on more than one occasion been carried into the criminal court. For several Sundays policemen have been stationed at the church to preserve order, and at one meeting the pastor claims he was badly hauled aud mauled by the wom en, one of whom was bound over to keep the peace. Dr. Pax too Denies the Interview. PiTTsmR, Dec. fx On the authority of Henry Prestley. who had been authorised by Dr. John R. Paxton to make the denial for him, the greater part of the interview alleged to have been had with Dr. Paxton and published in Pittsburg and New York papers on Sunday is branded as a lie. Dr. Paxton said he made no statements about wanting to kill certain persons iu New York and cut off the ears of others. A Republican Steering Committee Washington, Dec. 5.

STRIKE. Arbitrators Prom Two States Working to Settle th. Lchlch Trouble. Bethlehem. Pa.. Dec. 5. A conference between the joint arbitrators' committee, representing the boards of the states ot Aew ork and New JerseT ou the one hand and the representatives of the Lehigh Val ley railroad strikers on the other, was held here in the Kagle hotel. Tbe situation was discussed iu all its phases for three hours, at the end ot which time, no definite con clusion having been reached, the conference took a recess and met again at night. The arbitrators had a plan tor the settle ment of the strike, which was presented to the grievance committee. The latter took the ground that it would not entertain any proposition that would deny to the men the right which they claim is due them, and it was then agreed that a third plan, in fram ing which both strikers aud arbitrators would take a hand, be made readv. Xo effort was made by either committee to see President Wilbur, but at the earliest moment after a conclusion is reached he will be called upon and asked to lend Lis assistance to end the trouble. The feeling here is that the affair ia draw ing to a focus. Startling developments may at any moment transpire among the men on strike. Chief Arthar la Wllkesbarra. Wilkesbarrk, Pa, Dec 6.

TRAMPS' PARADISE, 0rror Lo wotting PerMds tree Arrest f agi-nats la Kinase. Topeka, Dec 5, One of the most re markable circulars ever issued by the ex ecutive of any state was sent oat by Gov ernor Lewelling. The letter is addressed to all boards of police commissioners In Kansas and particularly renders nugatory all vagrant laws. After reciting the hard ships of the poor in olden times the gov ernor reviews the present condition ot af fairs among the poorer classes in the conn try. He scores the laws now on the statute books which call the man out of work and penniless a "confidence man." Speaking of the vagrancy laws of Kan sas, he says: "It separates men Into two distinct classes, differentiated as those who are penniless and those who are not, and de flares the former crimiuals. Only the lat ter are entitled to the aiberty guaranteed by the constitution. To be found In a city without visible means of support or some legitimate business is the Involuntary con dition of some millions at this moment, and under t he law we proceed to punish them for being victims to conditions which we as a people have forced npon them." The circular then continues as follows: 'I have noticed in police court reports that 'sleeping in a box car hi among the varie ties of this heinous crime of being poor. Some police judges have usurped a sover eign power that is not permitted the high est functionaries of the states or nation, and victims of industrial conditions have been peremptorily ordered to leave town. "In some cities it is provided by ordi nance that if police court fines are not paid or secured the culprit shall be compelled to work out the amount as a municipal slave, and rock piles and 'bull pens' are provided for the enforcement of these ordinances. Such city ordinances are in flagrant viola tion of constitutional prohibitions. The rock piles and 'bull pens' should never have been used in degrading the friendless and poor. Let these twin relics of the departed auction block cease to disgrace the cities of Kansas, aud on Christmas day the rock pile, and the bull pen, and the "crime of being homeless aud poor be olisolete in all the cities of Kansas governed by the metro politan police act." 

POISON AND REVOLVER, A Morphine Kater Tries to Murder Hla Whole Family. Kkik, Pa., Dec 5. Kd ward Cady, a me chanic of this city, while suffering from a morphine debauch, planned the murder of his eu tire family, aud but fur the oppor tune arrival of his wife, whose grief seemed to disarm him, he would have succeeded. Sunday evening Cady gave his son Walter a heavy dose of morphine and kept his secret until his wife detected his crime. All night long he tore through the house weeping for bis boy aud in agonized terms expressed fear of public exposure. Karly on Monday moral ug he succeeded in borrowing a revolver from an unsuspect ing neighbor. Then gettiug his wife out of the house for a moment he began the work of murdering his innocent children. When his baby Hazel saw the revolver, she threatened to tell her mamma, but desist ed under a threat. Cady first dispatched little Bertha, who was too much engrossed by her school studies to observe her father's actions. He then sent a ball through Walter's braiu as he lay on the bed suffering from the poison he had been given a few hours prior. Cady turned to kill his son, but the latter rau out, escaptug the deadly missile, and called his mother. 11a by Hazel was to be the next victim, but Mrs. Cady's dis tracted cries caused the murderer to pause long enough to enable Jier to snatch the child. Cady glared a moment at his wife, and then, seeming to relent, he turned and fired a hall through his own disordered brain. The tragedy was the bloodiest and most revolting in the criminal annals of this city. Mrs. Cady, the unhappy wife, is in a raast pitiable plight, and it is feared she will lose her reason.

Mery, the JBonlangist, objected to some remark made by M. Raynal, minister of the interior, and shouted, "You are a wretch to talk like that!" The moderate Republicans called for or der and demanded that M. Mery should be censured. President Mahy vainly tried to bring the houfee to order, and he finally called on M. Mery to explain his language, but M. Mery's reappearance in the tribnne evoked a scene of tumult baffling descrip tion. When quiet was restored, M.

There were further noisy scenes in the chamber before it was possible to take a vote. Proffaaaor John Tyndall Dead. I-ondos, Dec. 5. Professor John Tyn dall, the eminent scieutist, died at Hasie mere, Surrey, where he resided.

Mrs. Tyndall is prostrated over her husband's death and refuses to see visitors. Owing to the sudden and pe culiar attack which resulted in Professor Tyndall's death, it has been decided to hold an inquest. The Times says of Professor Tyndall: "Altogether he was an extremely interest ing man. He was not great perhaps, but he was considerable from the strength and width of his interests and the range of his faculties. Above all, he was a hater of prejudice and of mental slavery." John Tyndall, in some respects the most notable of modern British physicists, was born of Knglish ancestry at Leigblin Bridge, county Cnrlow. Ireland, Aug. 21, 1S30.
