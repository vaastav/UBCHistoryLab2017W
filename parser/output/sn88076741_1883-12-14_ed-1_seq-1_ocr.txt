The fisbiog industry pursued by a Bumerous class of our icitiaons on Northern coasts, both of the Atlantio and Paciile ««••«», are worthy of the fostering care of congress. Whenever brought tnto competition with like indnstriee in other countries, our fisbennen, as. well as manufaoturera of Ashing anplianoee and preparers of fish produeta, have main a foremost place. 1 suggest that con create a commission to consider tbe question of our rights in the fish, crics, and the means of opening to onr citiiens, under Just and epdnring conditions, tbe richly stocked fittiiog aters aud sealing grounds of British kiorth America.

Her majesty's Rovernmont baa Insistsd that precautions have been taken be fore sbipmeut was made. However, tboy have in so many eases proven-ineffectual, and espe cially so in oertaininstancea of needy immigrant* reaching our territory through Canada, that a revision of our legislation upon this subject may be deemed advisable Correspondence relative to the dayton-Bulwer treaty bas been continued, and will bo laid before congress. A1IEBIC&M PORK. The legislation or Franca against the impor tation of prepared swine produced from the United States, baa been repealed.

Ger many atOl prohibits the introduction of all swine products from Americs. I extended to the imperial government a friendly invitation to send experts to the United States to inquire whether the use of these products waa danger ous to health. This invitation waa declined. 1 have believed it of such importance, bow ever, tbat the exact facts should b? ascertained and promulgated tbat 1 have appointed a com petent commlsaion to mske a thorougbinvesti gation of tho subject.

The coronation-of die csar at Koeeow afforded to the government an occasion for testifying to continued friendship by sending a special envoy aod a representative of the navy to at tend the ceremony. While there have arisen during tbe year no grave questions affecting tbe status in the Bussian empire of American citiiens or other faith than that held by the nations! church, this government remains firm in its convictions that tbe rights of its citizens abroad should ba iu no way affected by their religioue belief. It is understood that measures for the removal of the restrictions which now burden our trade srith Cuba and Porto Bico are under considsr stion by the Spanish government The prox imity of Cnba aud the peculiar method of ad ministration which. there prevails necessitate constant discussion and appeal on our cart from .the proceedings of the insular autboritioai I regret to say thst just protests of this gov ernment have not as yet producsd satisfactory results.

Claims to a large amount whioh were held by the late commission with out ita jurisdiction bavo boen presented to the Spanish govern aenr, as tbe ac tion of tbe colonial law authorities baa given rlee to thees elafma. The case of the Masonic baa not yet Machod a settlement' The Manilla court bsa found that tbe^ieapeedings of whioh this government hae en^lalned were authorized, and it is hoped tbat tbe government of Spain will not withhold the speedy repsration whioh its sense of Justfoe should impel it to offer for the un usual severity and uojuat action of its sub ordinate colonial officer* in the case of this' vessel. The Helvetian oonfedsration baa pro nosed the inauguration of aolassof interna *1 treatise for the deferment to arbitration of grave questions between nations.

Under the treaty of Berlin, liberty of con science and civil rights are assured to all stranger* in Bulgaria. As tbe United States have no distinct conventional' relatione with that country, snd are not a party 10 tbe treaty-, they ehould in my opinion maintain diplomatic representation also for the. improvement of in ereonrseanfi the propSr protection of tbs many American citizens who retort to that country ps missionaries aod teachers.

Tbe rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into that.country ehowa what bas already beea accomplished by tbe vaat reciprocal advantages whi6h must attend tba progress of its internal develop ments.

Questions havs arisen touching tbe righto of American and other foreign manufaoturera in China, under tho provisions of treatise which permit aliens to exercise their industriss in that country. On this specifio point our own treaty is silent But under the operation of the nunt favored na'iona clanee we have like privileges to tbo «e of other powers. While it is the duty of tbe govsrnment to see tbat our oitizens bavs tbe fuil enjoyment of every benefit secured by tresty, I doubt the expsdisncy of lesd ing in a movement to constrain China to admit an interpretation by whioh we have only an indirect right to exact tbe transference to China of American capital For the employment there of Chinese labor would in effect inaugurate a competition for the eontrol of markets now supplied by our bome industries. There is good reason to be lieve that the law restricting ths immigra tion of Chinees baa been violated intentionsllv or otherwiss by the ofltolale of Cbiua upon whom ia devolved tbe duty of certifying tbat the emigranto belong to tbe exoepted classes. Measures have been taken to asoertain tbe faota incident to thia auppoted infraction aud it ia believed tbat the government of China will oo-operate with the United States iu securing the faithfal observance or the law. The same considerations which prompted con gress at its laet session to return to Japan tbe Uimonsski indsmnitv seem to me to require at its hsude like action in respect to the Can ton indemnity fund, now amounting to $300, 000. Ths question of the general revision of tbe foreign treaties ot Japan haa been consid ered in an international conference beld at Tokio, but without definite result as yet Tnis government is diapoeed to concede the requests of Japan to determine its own tariff duties, pro vide such proper judicial tribunala aa may commend themselves to the Western powers for tbe trial of causes to which foreigosra are parties, and to assimilate the terms and d'',. . rationa of ita treatiea to those of other cmlissd 8'atee. Through our ministers at London aod Monrovia,-this government bsa endeavored to aid Liberia in its differences with Groat Britain, by. This arrangement ia a compromtae of tbe con flicting territorial claims. The rich sad populous valley of the COngo" is being opened to commerce by a society called tbe International Afriean asso ciation, of which tbe king of the Beigiana is prosidsnt, and a citizen of the United States chief execntive officer, and large tracte of territory bavs been ceded to tbs association by native chiefs. Ths objects of thisaaaoctation are philanthropic. It does not aim at perma nent political control, but seeks tho neutrality of the valleys which have been opened. Steamboats placed on tbs river and the nuclei of stales established it twenty.two etations trader one flu, which iffera freedom to commerce and pronibte the Jlave trade. Tbe United Statee cannot be indifferent to thia work, nor Jo tbe interacts of tbeir citizens involved in it It may become advisable for ua to co-operate with other 00m titercial powers in promoting tbe rights of fade and residence in the Congo valley free rom tbe influence or political oontrol of any one nation.

POSTOFF1CE AFFAIRS. A PEOLFLSIITO ST1TZ or FIMAKOCS. The report of tbe poetmaater general con tains a gratifying exhibit of tbe oondition and prosueota of this interacting branoh of tba public service committed to his care. It ap- eer ssrs tbat on June 30, 1883, the whole nutn of postufflese wae 47,863, of which 032 were established during tbe previoue fiscal year. The number of omcea operating under thesyatem of free delivery waa 154. At these latter nfficca the postage on local matter amounted to $4,195,230.62, a earn exeeediug by #1,021,894.01 the entire cost of tbe carriers' service in the country. Tbe rate of postage on drop letters passing through these oBees ie now fixed by law at two cents per balf ouooa or fraction thereof. In offices where the carrier system has not been abolished the rate is only half aa large. It will be remembered that in 1863, when free delivery wae first eetabliehed by law, the uniform single rate of poetage upon local let ters waa one cent, and eo it remained until 1872. when In thoee oitiee where carrier serv ice was established it waa increased to defray the expense of aueb eervica It eeema to mo that tbe old rate may now with pro priety be restored, and tbat too, even at a risk of diminishing for a time, at IsaaL re ceipts from postage npon local letters. loan see no reason why tbat particular olaaa of mail matter should be held accountable for tbe en tire cost of not only tto own collection and de livery but the collection and delivery of all other c.asses, and I am confident, alter full consideration of tho enbject, tbat the re duction of tbe rate would bs followed by encb a growing volume of buslnsss as to ocoaaion but alight and temporary loae to the revenue of the postoffice. POSTAL TELIOIAPB MOT SEOHD. The postmaster general devotes much of his report to the consideration in its various aspects of tbe relation of the government to tbe telegraph. Such reflection aa I have been able to give tbe enbjeot since my laet annual message bas not lad me toOhange tba view which I then expreeeed, in dieeentiug from tbe recommendation of the poetmaater general, tbat tbe government assume tbe came control over tbe telegraph which it haa alwaya ex ercised over tbe maila. Admitting tbat ita au thority in tbe premieee be aa ample aa has evet been claimed for iv it would not, in my judgment le a wise nee of tbat authority to pnrchaae orasaums tht eontrol of exletlog telegraph lines, or to eon struct others with a view of entering into gen eral competition witb private enterprise. Tbe objections which may Do justly urged against either of these projects and. Indeed, againat any ayatem which would require aa enormous increase in tbe civil service, do not, bowever, apply to eome of the plana wbieh have lately provoked public comment aad discussion. If baa been claimed, for example tbat congress might wisely authorize tbe poetmaater general to oontract with some private person or corporation for the transmleeioa of meessgee at specified rstee and under government supervision. Various audi echsmee, of the esme general nature out widely differing in their sneeial characteristics, have been dig ested in the publio printe, and the sr^umonte wbioh they have been eupportod and op posed have doubtleee attraoted yoar atteatton. it is likely that the whole enbjeot will be oon sidered by you at tbe preaeot session. In the netnre of things it involvee eo many queettone of detail that your deliberations would prob ably bo aided eligbtly-if at all, by aay par ticular suggestions which I might now submit. I avow my belief, howsvsr, that tbo govern ment ahould be anthoriaed bv law to exercise ooort supervision over ioterstate telegraph communication, and I expreee tbo hope that for attaining that endeome measure bedevieed which will receive your approbation.

It will be pereeived tbat they diaoouotenanoed any polit ical or religioue teats for admission to tbe ofleee of the pnbliooerviee to wbich the statute relates. The etatute related in its original form to the cteasiflsd clerkships in the several exec utive departmeute at Washington, numbering about 5,600, and to aimilar positions in tho customs distriots and postomces whore as many aa fifty parsons are employed. A classi fication of these positions, snalogous isting in the Washington offices, waa bsfore the law went into effect Eleven ouetoms districts and twenty-three postoffice* were tbue brought nnder the immediate operation of tb* statute.

RAILWAYS. Complaints have lately bsen numerous and urgent tbat certain corporations controlling in whole or part tbe facilities tor tho inter-stato carriage of merchandise by tbe great railways of the country have resorted in their dealings with the pnblie to divera measures unjust and oppreaaive in their obaracter. In some instances tbe State governments bavo attacked and auppreseed these evils, but in others tbey have been unable to af ford adequate relief because of the Jurisdictional limitationa whioh are imposed upon them by tbe federal constitution. Tho queetion wbether tbe national government may lawfully interfere in tbe premises, and what, if any, supervision of oontrol it ought to exor ctse, is one wbioh merits your eareful consid eration. Wbilo we eannot fail to recog nise tbe importance of the vast rail way systems of tbe oountry, aud their great and benefioial influonco upon the developmeot of our material wealth. We ahould, on tbe othsr baud, remember that no individual corporation ought to be invested witb absolute power over tbe interest of auy otbsr citizen or olassof citizens. The right of thoee railway corporations to any profitable re turn upon tueir investment anu to ressonttD freedom in their regulations must be recognized, but it seems only just that, so far as ita constitutional authority will permit, con greee ahould proteot people at large in their interstate trame against an act of injustice which State governments are powerlosa to prevent •htedoHeewtmUl arise, unless the wisdom or coogross shall provide-agsinst it* rscorreooe.

Thess questions relate to the proper interpretation of the phrase "ina bility to discharge the powero and dutiea of the a*id office" Our tew providing, tbat wben tbe president shall euffer from suoh inability, the presidential, office ahall devolve upon the vice president who must himself, un der tbe circumitanoes, give place to suoh offer as congress may by tew appoint to aot as president I need not here set forth numerous and interesting inquiries which ere suggested bv thess word*of the eoustitutlon.

It is greatly to be hoped that these momentuooa questions will find speedy solution, lest an emergency ahould arise when longer delay will be impos sible, and any determination, albeit the wisest may furnish cause for anxiety aud alarm.

Ilis name WAS William Cunningham, a native ol Washington, in Knox county. In his youth ho was occentric, like iiis lather, Asa, and that trait of character followed hiji through life. When he prcw up to manhood, ke other humans, lie fell in love, and his love was reciprocated by an pretty a ffirl UB was to be found in the town, and one ol'asgooi parentage, it is said that it Wris a remarkable instance ofdovotion on both side.'. She hap pened, however to die suddenly, ami it was her disease that completely up-et hitn. For eighteen months he" ieud a secluded life, and then he disposed of hta little property, went to Batmor, thence to Oldtown, jvhevo he did a littl lumbering business, and finally broiuhi up in tbe region of Moosuhetid Lake, where lie worked in the woods in winter and on farms in sum mer. About the year 1818 he worked in the lodging swamp near Cliestinccok luke, and in the spring he felled snmc trees on the shores on hind belonging lo the state, and built him a vamp. For three years he lived here clearing tip iahd and selling tl products of the soil to lumbermen. He was a large, muscu lar man, and, though possessing groat physical^Btrength, be lacked energy and perseverance, Occasionally he would have his sprees. While absent, some one, as he Btipposes, sot firb to his camp and burned all his tools, clothing and camp outiit. This disaster had such a depressing effect that he never fully re covered his former cheerfulness of mind. He, however, built another camp, and had a very good log house. He cleared up some twenty-five acres of land, built a log barn, and raised hay and oats. Ik made a two-wheeled hand-cart to haul his hay, on which he was able to trans port 300 or 400 pounds as a load. He had no disposition to wrong any one and liked to live in peace. About the year 1802 he worked in the logging swamp, and had trouble in settling his account in the spring, the company for which he bad worked claiming he was indebted to it some $14. This he declined to pay. He was sued, and his little farm, whirh was worth $800, was attached and eold, and he was driven away from bis bome by officers of the law. This blow com pletely broke bim down. Ho went stiil further down the lake bnilt another camp more remote from human habita tion, and there worked just enough to procure the coarsest food and scantiest clothing. The remainder of his time was spent in idleness. During the war of the rebellion he puid a visit to his sis ter in Rockland, on which occasion' he was dressed in continental style. He tried to imitate George Washington in his garb, and declared that he was done with this world. Last June he was stricken with paralysis, and for six days he lay helpless upon the ground, unable to get food or drink. During this time he was terribly tormented, by swarms of black flies and mosquitoes. lie was louud bv natives in a famished condition. With one hand, (tbe other being palsied) he had excavated a large pile of earth by his side, vainly, endeavoring to draw himself toward iood and water. He was brought to Greenville and kindly cured for, but nothing could save bim. and he died on the 1st inst, at the age of sixty five. Romance In Texas. Heuslon Special:—J. W.

Kisher A Co., in the United States Circuit Court, at Detroit, Mich., for an infringment of what is known to the trade as Lyon's Patent Metallic Heel Stiffen er.
