Another one of Kandiyohi county's soldier boys to die in Camp was Oscar Lohn. son of Mr. and Mrs. Amund L. Lohn of Burbank Township, who pas sed away at Camp Hancock, Georgia, on the 27th day of November. Oscar was one of the contingent of selected men who left from here on the 5th of September for Camp Grant, Illinois. Later he was transferee! to Camp Hancock, Georgia. On the way he was taken sick with the influenza and was sick for some time at Camp Hancock, but recovered. A few days before his death his regiment was transferred to Camp Johnston, prepara- Late Private Oscar Lohn. tory to embarking for service in France. Oscar was taken ill again and sent back to the base hospital at Camp Hancock November 21st. The following letter to his father from an officer in the medical corps may be of interest: Base Hospital, Camp Hancock, Augusta, Ga., November 27th, 1918. Mr. A. L. Lohn, Georgeville, Minn. Route 1, Box 19. My dear Mr. Lohn: I Want to write you about the sudden illness and death of your son Oscar. He was admitted to this Hospital on November 21st, 1918, complaining of head-ache and chills and of numbness in his arms. He had no fever and did not appear to be very sick. The symp toms he presented, however, were ^ery unusual and he was thoroly examined by our best experts in order to arrive at a definite diagnosis. His condition was very little changed during the three days he was here and we were not able to arrive at a satisfac tory understanding of the diagnosis, un til the autopsy, which showed that he poliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis. Death came very suddenly with no warn ing of its approach. It may comfort you somewhat to know that he did not suffer during his ill ness and that his death was mercifully sudden and without struggle. I wrfuld like you to know also that he had the constant care of our most skilled phy sicians and of faithful and devoted nurses. Everything possible was done to save his life and that our efforts were not successful is a matter of ex treme regret to us. You have the as surance of our sincere sympathy in your hours of sorrow. Sincerely yours, W. R. Buchanan, Major, M. C, U. S. Army, Ass't to Commanding Officer. The remains were brought home by Private Martin Shipstead, also a Bur bank boy, who had been his comrade in arms ever since they left from home. The funeral was held at the Crow River church in Burbank on Sunday afternoon, Dec. 1st, and was conduct ed by Rev. Svare. The pall bearers were Private Martin Shipstead, Dr. Henrik Shipstead, Sam Shipstead, Adolph Quistberg, Louis Larson and Joseph Newgord. A squad of eleven of the Willmar Home Guards under Capt. Klingenberg were present to do military honors at the grave. There were also six members of the Burbank Red Cross, in nurse's uniform who escorted the casket. Besides the bereaved parents, the departed soldier is mourned by three brothers, Silas, Burton, and Edwin, and three sisters, Minnie, Mrs. Martin Shipstead and Lyla Also by two grandmothers Mrs. Marit Lohn of Bur bank and Mrs. Randine Nelson, of Minneapolis, besides by many other relatives and friends. Oscar has been farming in Canada but when he saw that he would need to go to war he returned to the states prefering to "carry the musket" under the grand old stars and stripes. Rural Carrier Examination. The United States Civil Service Commission has announced an ex-tion mination for the County of KandiyohL Minn, to be held at Willmar on Dec. 14,1918 to fill the position of rural car rier at Raymond and vacancies that may later occur on rural routes from other post offices in the above-men tioned county. The examination will be open only to male citizens who are actually domiciled in the territory of a post office in the county and who meet the other requirements set forth in Form 1977. This form and applica tion blanks may be obtained from the offices mentioned above or from the United States Civil Service Commis sion at Washington, D. C. Applica tions should be forwarded to the Com mission at Washington at the earliest practicable date. During the continuation of the pres ent war the Commission will, in ac cordance with the request of the Post Office Department, admit women to rural carrier examinations upon the same conditions as men. By direction of the Cpmmission.

St. Paul, Minn., Dec. 6.—Forty-five Nonpartisan league delegates from the 13 states in which the League 1B organ izing are meeting in this city and have already taken important steps looking to the larger future before the organi zation. Articles of association to meet the needs of a national organization were adopted and A. C. Townley was re elected to the national executive com mittee and therefore as president. Mr. Townley, however, refused to accept the office, in view of the widespread at tacks on him personally, until the mem bers of the League sanction his elec tion by referendum vote. Resolutions have been adopted showing the posi tion of the League on the vital issues of the day. League accounts have been reviewed with the aid of outside audit ors aud found entirely satisfactory. The national committee has full powter over policies and other final decisions of the League. The national executive committee of three, in charge of admin istration, has been kept as it is and when a vacancy occurs it is to be filled by the remaining members with the consent of the national committee. Resolutions Adopted. 

WILLMAR TRIBUNE/WEDNESDAY, DEC. 11, 1918 The main feature of the articles of association is their provision for de-the mocratic control of the organization without letting down the bars to out side schemers and without sacrificing efficient administration. The township meetings are to send delegates to coun ty conventions, and the county conven tions in turn supply the state conven tion. The states convention chooses a state executive committee and the chair man of this committee becomes a mem ber of the national committee. There will thus be as many members of the national committee as there are states organized. the owner or his authorized agent, and then of the specific goods, properties, investments or securities involved, in order to eliminate gambling and specu lation in necessities of life.

WASHINGTON LETTER Washington, D. C.—President Wilson has delivered his message to congress and departed for Europe. The country prepared for the European trip by sev eral weeks of discussion, but it was not prepared for his message to congress. It is hard to determine at this time how country will take it. The conserv ative press declares it disappointing probably because the message shows no change in peace plans and because of politics, since the large interests for the last siv months have used their pub licity to discredit Wilson. There is little or no cheer in it, on the other hand for progressives and radicals. Those who had hoped for a constructive program for getting back to a peace basis and for measures look ing toward a new day for the common people, are met with the suggestion that the country should be allowed to reconstruct itself. Even on the dispo sition of the railroads the president would not express an opinion, but re sorted to the camouflage of "a difficult problem." His unqualified indorsement of lower taxation undoubtedly implies a let-up in the excess profits and big private income taxes. Evidently the plans of the great business interests of the nation for reconstruction in their own interests will meet no militant op position in defense of the people from the administration. President Wilson's re-indorsement of woman suffrage, how ever, will please the progressives vitally interested in that issue. Peace Party Personnel. The peace delegation to Europe now includes, besides President Wilson, Rob ert Lansing, secretary of state Henry White, long-experienced diplomat Gen eral Tasker H. Bliss and Colonel E. M. House, the president's confidential ad viser on world questions. If traditional methods are to be followed little fault probably can be found with this commis sion, but many had hoped we would break away from traditional methQds sufficiently to allow direct representa tion of the great laboring and farming President Gompers of the American Federation of Labor, for instance, has returned from a European tour on which he was honored by all the.hours nabobs of the allied countries, but this week he goes back to attend an in-sponsible ternational labor conference to meet while the nabobs and potentates of the world are deciding the fate of world democracy. .The men most interested in world democracy will thus look on with such information as the peace con ference pares to give out, while men chosen in the old style will decide the issues. British labor, on the other hand, will have a real peace delegate. Prob ably if we likewise had had a militant political labor and farmer movement, we too could have placed a man on the nabob as well as the bob conference. The Senate Tight. Senator Borah of Idaho still holds to his declaration that "Penrose must go," so far as the leadership of the senate finance committee in the new congress is concerned. Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania, who is in line for the chairmanship of that committee, remarks that "Borah is only one vote in the senate." Under the rules of the senate the chairman of committees are chosen by a majority vote of the senate itself. Under the custom which has prevailed the Republicans in caucus have agreed upon their slate of committeemen and chairmen, and the Democrats in caucus have similarly agreed upon their own of the jobs. Then the floor leader of the majority party has taken the two lists and offered a motion that the men named therein be elected to the committees designated. The mo tion has prevailed by unanimous vote CO This year, if Borah keeps up his di rect war against Penrose, there will be a serious struggle in the Republican caucus, and the progressive group may refuse to be bound by the caucus ac tion. That was the case at the be-in ginning of the Wilson regime, when the progressives voted for Senator Clapp of Minnesota in opposition to Senator Gallinger of New Hampshire in the race for president pro tempore of the striate. At that time the total Republican vote was less than the Democratic vote in the new congress the votes of Borah and one other Re publican senator will be enough to de stroy the Republican majority and to permit the Democrats with their help to control not only the chairmanship of th^ finance bu ever othe mmittee place in the upper branch of congress. Borah and Norris and La Follette, however, are Republicans by lifelong association. They have no reason to be grateful to the Democrats in the senate for the treatment they have received during the past few years. Deep as is their contempt for the political methods and objects of the old guard of their own party, and determined as they are to carry on the war to make the Repub lican party safe.for decent citizens, they feel bound to recognize that the Demo cratic gang in the senate is not„a whit better. California labor Program. Members of congress have received from the reconstruction committee of the California State Federation of Labor a report dealing with wages and the cost of living, and declaring that the wage level must not be reduced dur ing the reconstruction period. "Our resources of labor and utilized resources have been increased during the war," says the report, "while those of other countries have been diminish ed. We have practically everything that the world needs, and we alone among the industrial nations seem to be in. a position to export in vast quantities the materials needed in re-1 construction. "For this reason the California State Federation of Labor can see no possible excuse for the cry that wages shall be reduced to the pre-war stand ard or that working hours shall be lengthened.

Specifical ly, it demands that the entire program of the California Union of Producers and Consumers—comprising the Fed eration of Labor, the Farmers' union and the Pacific Co-Operative league— shall be enacted into law. That pro gram includes public ownership of all public utilities, including terminal pro warehouses and packing plants farm er and labor representation upon all state boards and commissions a? com plete system of health insurance by the state stimulation of co-operative societies, etc. The Russian Question. Dicussion of the possible withdraw al of American troops fjrom Russia is going the rounds. If the British Labor party wins, or comes near winning, in the British election on December 14, the British government will be in no position to continue its hostile attitude toward the Lenine government in Rus sia. The French Socialists, like the Bristish Labor party, are opposed to the attemptd overthrow of the bolshe viki, as are the Italian Socialists. These political elements are lined up for President Wilson's 14 points of settlement of the war. In proportion as they incr.ease, and as the new states between Russia and Germany expel their aristocrats and form republics, the argument for American neutrality Russia will be pressed. Irish Work for Home Bule. From every direction the Irish are bringing pressure to bear upon Presi dent Wilson in behalf of their native country. Senator PlJelan of Califor nia has presented to the president a petition from the priests of the Roman Catholic archdiocese of San Francisco, headed by the progressive Archbishop Edward J. Hanna, asking that he sup port the claim of Ireland to be a free and independent nation. He presented also a petition drawn up by the poet and dramatist, Padraic Colum, asking for the release of Irish political pris oners. Large numbers of the Sinn Fein leaders from every part of Ire land have been arrested and held in prison, according to occasional reports coming here. The London dispatches indicate that the Sinn Fein candidates for parliamentary seats are likely to sweep nine-tenths of the island in the coming election.

Since the advent of the St Loiri*Browns ville & Mexico Railway, theselands have been placed on the market and made available for the farmer, people from all over the world have been attracted to this wonderfully rich' country, by reason of its climatic conditions and general healtbiillness, together with the excellent opportunities offer ed for the growing of corn, cotton, hay, sugar cane, trucks, fruits, as well as for«Jairying, hog and stock raising and di versified farming. Twenty towns and villages have been established in this great Valley since the railroad came in and the shipments for 1917 totaled 2,219 carloads of food stuns harvested before June 1st This Valley is from three to fourteen miles in width and fifty miles long and all the lands within the reparian rights are available for water from the Rio Grande River, through one of the finest irrigation systems in the United* States: and this water carries with it a silt which acts as a fertilizer for the soil, which produces three abundant crops a year. In 1917,60,000 acres of the Valley cultivated under irrigation, produced and sold over $6,000,000 worth of pro duce, during the driest season in the history of Texas. The J. C.
