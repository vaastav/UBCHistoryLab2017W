Immense crowds of people were gath ered along the route and outside of .the new building and cheered the Emperor and the German reigning Princes on their way there and upon their arrival. Prince Hohenlohe, the Chancellor,, and Field Marsnal Ulumenthal, Chief of the General Staff of the Prussian Army, Is about eighty-four years old, were ac corded an especially warm welcome from the people. ' The sew Reichstag building, a monu mental structyre, has taken over ten years to build. . , . On June 9. 1634, the foundation was laid by Emperor William In the pres ence of nearly all the German Princes and rulers. . . Since that time the chief architect, Paul Wallet, and scores of assistants, scu.p tors, painters, carvers and artisans from every part of Germany have been busy oa the structure, and now Jt is being de dicated to its proper use. Yet It is not by any means complete and (lnltfted In all Its details. Among the more note worthy objects It stl.l lacks are the great Ulsmarck statue, to be placed In the west frontage; the two gigantic heralds, to be placed on the east frontage, and the outer decorative surroundings, which, with the complete clearing of the square arourM the building, will take years. It stands on the east side of the Koe-nlg-Platz, a stone's throw from the Col umn of Victory, and covers 11,638 square meters. It has cost 28,700,000 marks to build and equip, of which 18. 000,000 only were asked for under the first estimate. As to the style of architecture It Is a special creation of the architect, belong ing strictly to no school at all. The building Is quadrangular, flanked by four turrets, and bears In the centre part of its roof a cupola made of gilt wrought Iron.

Andrews's "Vindication" tho Sub ject of Much Comment Tenderloin Bods Again In Evidence, Reaily to Testify. Street Cleaning Commissioner An drews's vindication of his ofuctal charac ter as President of the Excise Board, which he presented to the Senate In vestigating Committee yesterday with the able assistance of Mr. Goff, was the sole topic of conversation this morning among the throng that gathered at the Lexow headquarters In the Court-House this morning. It was likened to the vindication which Civil Justice George F. Roesch Insisted upon and obtained when he felt that his character had been aspersed by Mrs. Augusta Thurow early In the Investigation. Like Justice Roesch, Commissioner Andrews, when it was all over, probably wished that he hadn't, for when Mr. Goff finished with him In the hot wind-up last evening, his gen eral appearance suggested the condition of a man who had been suddenly and unexpectedly overtaken by a Kansas cyclone. No Evidence that lie Wasn't llrlbed. Although he denied very solemnly .that his action as an Excise Commissioner had ever been Influenced by money con siderations, Mr. Goff told him very plain ly that he had not produced the slightest evidence to prove that ho had not been paid tS00to grant a license to Mme. Chaude's notorious resort, the Malson Tortonl, as his former friend, ex-Chief Inspector Tomllnson, had testified, but that the whole record was against him on this particular Issue. That he regarded his vindication as sufficient was shown by the fact that he kept away from the Committee this morning. All the other witnesses, how ever, who have been In waiting for the last two days were on hand early, among them being the little bevy of faded beau ties of the Tenderloin.. There were also a number of tired and dejected-looking Frenchmen, who, it is said, will be asked to tell the Committee what they know about the protection afforded by the po lice at the annual public balls of the French cooks and other social organiza tions, where open violations of the Ex cise law and other Irregularities have been notortopsly permitted.
