IRISH FREE STATE (Continued from F*f?

The position of I'ister Is less certain. Uvtdence conies from llelfast tonljfht that the treaty will be subjected to the most searching examination before re ceiving assent, an 1 doubtless many modifications will be proposed. The king hastened to send the prime minister a te'egram. congratulating him, on the success of the ti-gi>:i.itions. and declaring. "I am o\ epjoyed to hear fie news." The king will come t<?
