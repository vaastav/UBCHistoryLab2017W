No man ever leforc came to the Senate of the United States with eucIi credentials as were presented yesterday by Senator elect Money. He was appointed by the governor to fdl the unexpired term if (he late Senator George. "When the governor sought to make the appointment he was away from the capital and quarantined en account of the yellow fever. "Writing to his secretary for a blank commission, lie wad sent one such as were used in the apioit;tuu-ut or constables and that sort of thing. It designated Air. Money to act as Senator at the pleasure of the governor or until his appointment was revoked. This was clearly irregular and Mr. Money and the governor decided that it was be fore Mr. Money started for Washington, bu thcgovertior thought the Senate would know hit. intentions and let it stand. Discussing the matter with a member of the Committee nit Privileges and Elec tions the otliei day that member told Mr. Money that he could hardly be seated on bucli ciedentials, but that he might on the notoriety of his appointment. So it happened that when the credentials were laid before the .Senate yesterday Mr. Chandler objected to them, on the grounds oC theli irregularity, and he was sustained by Mr. Hoar. Tne other side ot tuu rase w taken by Senators WaltnallandTcIler. and after a debate that was quite breezy, but not very serHiii, Mr. Money was sworn in, and given a seat on a Iwck row. Then cart.t the usual flood yf petit ions, bills and remlutloiih incident to the open ing day of a session, few of tlieui being of importance.

Now llecognized as a Cause of Seri ous Disease. Acid dyspepsia, commonly called heart burn or sour stomach, is a. form of indiges tion resulting from fermentation of the food. The stomach being too weak to promptly digest it, the food remains until fermentation begins, filling the stomach with gas, and a bitter, sour, burning taste in the mouth is often present. Thlscondl Uon soon becomes chronic, and being an every-day occurrence is given but litUe attention. Eecause dyspepsia, is not im mediately fatal, many people do nothing for the trouble. "Within a recent period a remedy has been discovered prepared solely to cure dyspepsia and stomach troubles. It Is known as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets and is now becoming rapidly used and pre scribed as a radical cure for every form ot dyspepsia Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have been placed berore the public and are sold by druggists everywhere at 50 cents per pack age.

In other words, $30.6,000,000 ot greenbacks, when re deemed in gold, must be. held In the Treabury, thereby contracting the currency to that amount, and these greenbacks be ing reissued only on condition that a like amount of gold be deposited for the green backs reissued. In either case, .?34G, 000,000 in gold or greenbacks would be locked up in the Treasury and permanently out of circulation. "Fortunately for the ctuutry, however, the I'rcildent hestltates to put this scheme in operation until the revenues received by the Government are sufficient to pay current expenditures, so that we may be assured that under the Dinglcy bill the I lesident's plain of retiring green back r will be indefinitely postponed. Ills recommendation that national banks be perm tted to Issue notes at the par value of bonds deposited ami tiiat Ue note-, shall be made redeemable In gold will not do. If It is a great strain and bur den upon the Government to maintain gold redemption for $310 dOO.OOOof green backs, how can the banks possibly cb taln gold to redeem their notes-.' If ail the wealth and power of the Government finds it hazardous to maintain geld re demption, how could part of that wealth invested in banking institutions procure gold? Htinks would he forced to surrender their notes and thus work disastrous con traction of the currency. Sti tcLeme can be devised tint is worse thnu this. "It doe" not occur to the I'resldMit that silver is redemption money, tne same as gold, and that, our currency system can be maintained on a bimetallic basis with out ary forced contractions ot aur cur rency The country, however, need take no alarm, lor the Republican party find- itself wholly unable to legislate upon the currciicy question. The Republican party in the House will not adopt the scheme of the President, nor will they give at tention to the plans of the Secretary ot the Treasury. The program marked out by Mr. Reed. Speaker ot the House, Is to do nothing on the currency question. For this, the country can he congratulated. "No doubt this policy ot doing nothing will In this session, au in the last, lie religiously adhered to. The Democrats warned the country In the last campaign that the Republican party would do noth ing for the relief of the people in their financial afrnlrs. TliN warning is coming to pasf. "We can assure the people, how ever, that the outlook for Democratic re lief is hright, and the time for it to come ib fast approaching. "Tile Tresldent's labored diesfrtailon upon the necessity for currency reform.'' said Mr. Doekery, "disclosed the ever-' present perils of a gold standard. He adroitly attempts to conceal the efrect of the recommendation that 'United States notes redeemed in gold should not again be paid out except In exchange for gold,' although It is manifest that legislation "ou- terring upon the Secretary ot the Treaaury such power would result in impounding the greenbacks and other Treasury obliga tions, and thus still further contract the volume or money In circulation. With the limited amount or gold which conslitites tho only money of redemption, the uov- ernment must either retire the obligations which call for gold or else now and then borrow gold by increasing the interest-bearing debt. With n Treasury deficiency under the Dingley bill, amounting in four months to nearly fifty millions ot dollars, the menace of a bond issue to replenish the gold reserve is imminent. Tnc President ieeks to aold this danger by a iccotumendatioit which in cj feet au thorizes the Treasury Department to retire a large part ofoiuiiaper money. The people will not be deceived by t his recommendation Its purpose is olrvioi.s; but the President 's logical, if not frank, in desiring to retire the Treasury obligations, which, by Treas ury construe tion.are payable in goldaloue, rather than to hire more gold by another tond issue. The President's policy practi cally retires the grenebacks while oon inendiug the system of national banks. It will be nisappnned by the people." Discussing the message in general, Chimp Clark, of Missouri, said, yesterday: The President's, message will be a disappoint ment to the country. The bulk of the American people are heartily in favor ot grantiugb"lllgerent rights to the struggling Cubans immediately, aud of recognizing their independence at no distant day, and they will not take kindly to Mr. McKinley's suggestion ot doing nothing to help th-j.n. There are two reasons for this: First, be cause tire love ot freedom Is thoroughly ingrained in the American character; and lastly, because the Cuban war is cautfag great lossesto usin (c wayottrade. "In the last campaign, Democrats every where charged that the intention of the single gold standard advocates was to retire aud cancel the greenbacks. This was denied vehemently by the Republicans. Now comes the President, and by his mes sage proves that we were right. His recommendation as to greenbacks is a thinly disguised proposition to retire them. Nobody will be deceived as' to the real intent. "The vast majority ot the people are opposed to extending and perpetuating the national banking system, which the Presi dent proposes. He suggests that their privileges and opportunities for making money be increased by 10 per cent, while their taxes are to be reduced by one-half. A tremendous revolution in public opinion must take place or the Democrats will win or that proposition. "The scheme to popularize national banks, by diminishing Hie amount of capital neces sary to establish them in small towns, would be a great thing for the Republican gold standard party it It would work, but it will not. The people are not deslrious ut th-i gold gang having a recruting ta ion. in every neighlvirhood. "Or. the whole, the message will be a tip top campaign document for the Democrats."
