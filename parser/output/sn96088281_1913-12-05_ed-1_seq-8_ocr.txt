A big battle seemed Imminent at Tampico today between strong forces of Mexicuu reb els and federals. Having approved General Huorta's acts as president nnd dictator, Mexico's congress was expected to annul tho last election this afternoon and porhaps ratify a big railroad concession to a Belgian company. Mexico City diplomats smiled at Huerta's boaBt that he- would stick to his present post for a year, believing1 ho knows as well as any one that his reglmo's end Is near. i Reports that Queen Wllhelmlna of Holland had offered to mediate In Mexico and that lluerta had refused wan skeptically received. I It developed that when British oil producers cancelled their contracts to supply the Mexican National Rail ways with fuel, they did It merely to please the rebels nnd that the rail ways will continue to get their fuel oil. I News that Antonio Caballero, north Mexican millionaire, had boon shot for plotting against the rebels pro duced n painful Impression among Mexico City officials, who feared their turns would come next. I President Wilson's message to con gress was suppressed at Vera Cruz. General Villa nnnonneed that he ntid his rebel forces would occupy, Chihuahua City tonlsht or tomorrow.' Survivors of tho federals who fled from Chihuahua City were expected at thft border this afternoon, but many were said to hnve died on th road.
