TEAPOT TEMPF.ST From the Democratic point of view the rumpus over the Japanese school question In San Francisco id amusing rather than serious. Republican statesmen and newspaper* of the party have suddenly become sticklers for the strictest construction nr the funda mental principles of state's rights. They are giving further evidence of a tendency to veer around toward the Democratic point of the political com pass. But, us is quite usually the case with fresh converts, they reach the ex treme length of the zealous tether. The California delegation In con gress, which Is solidly Republican, backs the school authorities of San Francisco In the ostracism of Japanese pupils from the white public schools. Leading Republican newspapers of the northern part of the state take the same position. Thin In face of the treaty between the United States and Japan and defiance of the attitude assumed In the question by President Roosevelt. And In this newly found respect for the ab stract doctrine of state's rights, it may bc properly said , that these inconsist centeent Republicans are democratically right on the constitutional point raised. Not even nn international treaty to which the United States government is a party enn deprive a state of the rlpht to mnnage its affairs In Its own way so long as it violates no provision of the federal constitution. There is nothing In the constitution even re motely bearing on the issue raised In Snn Francisco. That Issue, ' conse quently, comes within the scope of article 10 of the constitutional amend ments: "The powers not delegated to the Unitea States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people." But while the San Francisco school authorities and their backers are con stitutionally right In this matter their bumptious attitude is suggestive of "a tempest In a teapot." The San Fran cisco officials and the Republican statesmen who represent California in congress appear to be working their wrath up to the fighting point. They are intimating that war between the United States and Japan would be a trivial matter of consideration com pared with the tolerance of Japanese pupils in the white public schools of San Francisco. It Is a ridiculous but characteristic situation In that sorely afflicted city. As a matter of fact the row over the Japanese school question in San Fran cisco is merely an offshoot of the ef forts made by union labor leaders to stop Japanese Immigration to the United States. Although California interests are suffering today because of insufficient labor, as witness the orange industry, the labor leaders would bar Just the kind of labor that is needed the most. The absurdity of the claim that Japanese immigration is a menace to California is conclusively proved by the official immigration statistics for last year. The total number of Japanese Immigrants to the United States in 1905 was 10,332. Only a very small fraction of that number were unable to read and write. During the same period more than 1,000,000 immigrants came from Europe. About 600,000 of the number were from Italy and south eastern Europe. Of the 180,000 Italians 48 per cent could neither read nor write and the record for the rest of the 600,000 was but little better. 

WEATHER BUREAU SERVICE Los Angeles readers who scan the dally reports issued by the weather bureau will indorse this declaration: "The fact is that the weather bureau scientists have much to learn — they hav-e dropped to the rear cf the pro cession and It 1b time that they were up and doing." The quotation is from an interest ing lecture 3ellvered Monday night before the Academy of Science by William A. Spalding. The allusion to delinquency in the output of the weather bureau related to the broad er scope of meteorological science, but it hit the mark in respect to the erratic service of the bureau in its weather forecast. During the recent rainy period, for lnctance. the fore casts generally were diametrically op posite to the results. They were such persistent misfits that they suggested an easy method of betterment—revers ing the forecasts after working them out. It is a fact, ns pointed out by Mr. Kpalding, that the weather bureau seems to have "dropped to the rear of the procession." It costs the gov ernment more than a million dollars annually and while Its forecasts un doubtedly are useful, generally speak ing, it seems to be running In a rut. So far as the public can observe there has been but little ; rogress in the service since the organization of the bureau in 1871, more than a genera tlon ago. The h«ad of the bureau in its curly dayi was dubbed "Old Prob abilities" and the proportion of mis lit prognostication!! then are matched fulrly well now. Even since the organization of the bureau on its present basis in 1891 it has made liut little perceptible head way outside of its daily lilts and misses at the weather, considering what It costs the government it would seem that it should take the leadership in meteorological Hcienee, or ut^eu | evin pi.c, uith Itfj pretentious iv- HtitutioiiH which are not so fortunate us to have the bin-king of a govern ment and more than a aiillicin dollars for yearly expense account. The adoption of the amendment .to the utate constitution providing for the deposit of publlo funds In banks will bc a great boon to the county . and city treasurers of California. Uncle Hilly Workman will feel particularly relieved' and bo will Captain lluiu-u when lie, comes into office. » LOS 

ANGELES HERALD: FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7. 1906. AN INVPNTION WANTED Wanted— An invention whereby our Southern California Oil product may bc made ad available for heating com paratively small homes as it Id for heat lng larga homed. During the last week .or more the question of house warming tin* been the salient topic of discussion among the great mass of people in Lou An gples and other communities in this part of the state. In this city It has been paramount, evoking greater inter est than the municipal election, nt least ln domestic, circle? In the local hotels and other large ntisincs comfortable temperature is maintained !>y trio use of Of] us fuel. Kven in view of the recent Sharp :l(1 vnnee In oil prices the enst nf heating by nil Is tint more than one-fifth the ennt of heating by coal. That estimate is on the assumption, ns Indicated by government pxporimpms, thai three barrels nf crude oil are equivalent In ■ ton of cnnl In generating POWCT, Mid consequently for nil healing purposes, Hotels and the like are paying now for nil, according to recent quotations, from 65 to -70 cents a barrel. That would make the oil-equivalent of I ton of coal cost about $2. At the same time 9 0 per cent of the people of this city have been warmed (literally and figur atively, by coal costing at their homes an average of $15 a ton. That Is at the rate of a fraction more than TO cents a sack, presumably weighing 100 pounds, but usually "shy" many pounds. If oil Is so ensily ndnptnble to heating purposes nn a large scale, why might It not be adapted tn like service on a small scale? That Is the question now before the house in Los Angeles — be fore and within nearly all tho houses in the city. And the correlative ques tion, as submitted, Implies a public yearning for a means of making oil serviceable for heating in all homes. There Is but little to hope for in the way of cheaper coal here at least In the near future. The railway com panies have a "dead cinch" on the coal market by reason of their control of transportation. The coal that we get in Los Angeles comes mainly by railway from New Mexico. The cost of the product at the mines, as reported, is $2 a ton. The difference between that first c*»st price and the figure paid for it by house keepers represents the charge for trans portation and the expenses and profits of middlemen. The railways, as usual, take the lion's share. It is said that for a single carload of coal costing $80 at the mine "the railways receive about $225 for transporting It to Los Angeles." And all this when fuel available for almost any purpose excepting the heat ing of our homes Is literally at our doors in unlimited quantity and on sale at the rate of less than $2 for the heating equivalent of a ton of coal. MR. HARPER'S OPPORTUNITIES Also Some of the Dangers That Beset the Pathway of the Chief Executive LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6.— [Editor Herald]: When inducted into the, may oralty of this great city Arthur C. Harper will hold the highest public position as a Democrat in all the three Pacific coast states, except that occu pied by Governor Chamberlain of Ore gon. Hence he will not only be re sponsible to the ■good people of this city, but to the Democratic party in the state and nation. By his policy and services he can be instrumental In advancing the welfare of the city and in giving acceptable character to his party locally and in a wide field. Mr. Harper is a young man of good character, but inexperienced in public office. What he shall do In this first office will either end his political ca reer in ruin, or .will be the basis on which he can build an enviable career for the future for good conduct and effective public service. The basis of his policy must be Democratic, having in mind constantly the rights and wel fare of the whole people. His triumph in the first affray is flattering, but it is no harbinger of future success, unless he acts unselfishly and for the general good. Mr. Harper ought to know, and if he does not know he soon will, that vampires, political bosses, men of pre tentious iniluence, will surround and attempt to fasten themselves on him. Those who would advance the inter ests of corporations and special priv ileges for their own benefit will fawn on and coddle him, telling him how wonderfully influential they are. Such men have made advances claiming his enr and favor because they betrayed their uwn party candidate, or repre sent some influential interest. The moment lie encourage.* men of sinister motives by listening to their impor tunities and twaddle about what they, represent the worse he will be pes tered and bewildererd. Muyor Harper will be especially Im portuned to appoint push men of Whatever party on the several com missions, and more especially to those where there is the best opening tor graft or granting Hpeclul favors. What Mayor Harper mosi tisedi to do for his own future and (he public wel fare is to take the Whole people into his confidence. If lie does that the bosses, ward heelers and the whole Kiing that lives from polities will flee from him as from the wrath to come, and will be as harmless us a toothless babe. Nobody will object to the appoint ment of those who have rendered him a service in the uampaign, provided they are capable, honest uud faithful to the cause c.f the people. Mr. Harper will enter office with the pond wishes of all honorable and high minded citizens. His character was not assailed In me - inpatgn and it will be a ralamity to him und the pub lic If he fails to rtttajn the good repute in which he is held. A FRIEND.

MODERN TRAVEL ON THE OCEAN A LUXURY ldealI Ideal Condition* Prevail on the Voyage from America to Europe, With Spiritual and Creature Comforts From lh« London Telegraph. When our grandfathers went to sea most of them made up their minds to bcb be unhappy. They knew that, in the conditions then prevailing, an ocean voyage was Inseparable from misery and discomfort. Their successors, how ever, go on board ship with a light heart, knowing thai they will have nil the luxuries of shore life, with none of its wear and tear. Of course, there is still the dreaded ma>l de mer, but even that has been robbed or much of Its terror. Indeed, even the moderately good sailor who takes his passage on the "beamy" Atlantic steamer of large tonnage, which does not force the pac« ln nil weathers, and which Is prac tically devoid of vibration, thanks to the turbine, can hardly fall to keep his sen legs, and to enjoy that which, In Home comparative cockle-shell of a former age, would have been a painful experience. The biff steamers of the present day may have been built main ly with an eye to economy, but In reality they have proved a veritable boon to travelers, first by reason of their steadiness, and secondly on no count of their roominess. Wretched, fluffy quarters, termed by courtesy cabins, hnve given place to apartments so commodious that they would have seemed Impossible a score of years ago, while what may be called the Improved physical surroundings of the voyager have been accompanied by an amount of attention to his spiritual and crea ture comfort which makes him today almost a pampered person. And the pampering still goes on. !t Is on the Atlantic thnt life at "en Is especially identical In point of luxury with existence ashore, On other oceans there Is progress toward the same end, hut It is In Ihe run from Europe to America that ideal conditions have been set up. To begin with, the passenger is no longer rut off from the rest of mankind. Wireless telegraphy brings him the news nf the day, which he reads every morning- in a newspaper published In mldocenn. The same means enables him to keop in per sonal touch with his friends ashore. Thus all sense of complete Isolntinn has gone forever. At the same time there is the sensation of being In a floating hotel which, in point of equipment, might be matched, but could not he excelled, either in Piccadilly or the Place Vendome. You have your own suite of apartments, with its salon, its bedroom nnd Its bntli nnd toilet room, and the decoration and upholstering-, the work of real artists, may be trusted to convey a sense of harmony. Telephones at Hand You have telephones at hand and movable electric lamps at your dis posal and you sleep in a real brass bedstead and not in that uncomfortable thing called a berth. You can have a cabin de luxe, sufficing for family needs, or, if you are voyaging en garcon, j'ou can be accommodated, at a reasonable rate, on the now popular principle of "one man, one cabin," which the Norddeutscher-Lloyd com pany did so much to establish. The Idea of herding strangers together — always one of the disagreeable features of former ocean travel— is going out, Just as the notion has been dispelled that wardrobes, chests of drawers, writing tables, and other indispensa-r ble essentials ashore are really not needed in a steamer's cabin. The up per berth, with its need for some dis play of athleticism, is not yet extinct, but the best of the steamship compa nies are. doing away with it wherever they can. Palatial Is the proper epithet to apply to the dining saloons of the best of the modern liners. Here, again. In the matter of internal arrangement there Is a tendency to follow shore practice. The old idea of requiring passengers to sit down at long tables Is growing obsolete. The Cunard company, for instance, has broken away from tra dition in this respect, for on the Caronia and the Carmania their new turbine steamers, the rigid prandial arrangements of a former age have given place to the provision of a num ber of small tables. Doubtless the same idea will be adopted In those mammoth vessels, the Lusltania and the Mauritania. If, however, those steamers are to be really up to date they will also have to possess an ocean restaurant as well as a dining saloon, for the experience of the Hamburg- American company is emphatic on this point. They began, experimentally, with a grill room on the Deutschland. The Idea showed an intelligent under standing of human nature. People do not care to dine in droves, like a flock of sheep, and it Is a gratuitous as sumption that the table d'hote menu will appeal to every one with the same force. The restaurant ashore finds Its jus tification in the demand for the light "Ah! the Black Hand!' That maaiu . .uit-pin' orful'a goln' to happen to ma!" Wwiry— <>h! If I could only git in* Maude on d« hobo dat put de "Timid in valid lady" «lgu on di* gat* pout ! meal at odd hours, or he little dinner of one'd own choosing. The Hamburg- American company (<oon found out that the Dputsohlandd grill room was ap predated ami In their next big shin, the Amerlka, it blossomed into a full blown restaurant. The success of the lnstallationI Installation was ,'i«;nln shown when tno Kalderln Augusts Victoria '(imp to be fitted. It may be taken today thai the Hamburg American romps ny will never revert to the old style and that the best of Its Atlantic liners will al ways have a restaurant, served from •i separate kitchen, and equal to that which the Canton Or any other London hotel can offer. Our ancestors would have been amazed at the notion of being nblo to order a la carte In mid ocean and still more of being able to obtain a pick of recognized national dishes. But their amazement would not end there. Two New Cunardera ltI It nifty be taken for grunted that the two big ('unnrderß which are now building will be supplied with passen ger lifts. Their great size will render those essential. But the elevator Is Of comparatively modern Introduction on board ship. Here, once more, the Ham burg-American line 'was first In the field, with electric lifts running from the lower to the upper decks. Their convenience Is undeniable, and they have come to stay. Then, again, II may be predicted that we shall see a still further advance in what, may be called the public apartments of these. floating palaces. Perhaps there is not much obvious room for improvement in the matter of smoking rooms, many of which are comparable to nothing less than liaroninl halls, while the witchery of certain of the ocean draw lng rooms might make even Park Lane envious. • • .*•- The real progress Just nnw seems to be in the matter of lounges, where light refreshments may be obtained from i buffet, and whero ladles may equally with gentlemen sip their boffee. after dinner. The newest departure In this direction Is the palm court on the Kalserln Auguste Victoria, where, un der spreading branches, and to the mu sic of cooling fountains, sociability may reign supreme. One of the features of the Caronla nnd Oarmnnia is the lounge on the boat deck, with Its easy chairs and divans. The newer C'unard ers will probably go one better In this respect. Of the accommodation which is provided for writing purposes on the modern liner, there is no need to speak, for as a rule it is both capacious and dainty; nor is it necessary to lay stress on the very efficient measures which are now taken by the use of elevtric fans, and otherwise, to assure proper ventilation on board ship. Half tho troubles of old-time ocean travelers could be set down to stufnnless, wheth er In cabins or public rooms. Nowa days the air Is first hand, as it ought to be on the ocean. A few years ago the attitude as sumed toward the steamship passenger was one of qualified toleration. He must not do this, and he must not do that. If he wanted any particular thing he must ask for It within certain hours, or he would not get it. He was hidebound by all sorts of restrictions of a stupid and irritating character. Today all this has changed. The strug gle Is to make the passenger feel at home, and to render him conscious of having lost nothing In point of person al comfort because he Is a thousand miles from land. For Instance, one of the common trials of ocean voyaging is the lack of means of exercise. That is why wise people are always pacing the deck, sometimes at a furious rate. To meet their case some of the German liners are fitted with gymnasia, where the athletic may keep themselves In good trim and hold corpulence at a dis tance. Again, there Is an ample choice of baths. Of course, all boats are not alike, but on some of them you can have an elec tric bath, and there Is even the prom ise that the Hamburg-American com pany will presently build a boat which will contain a Turkish bath and a swimming bath as well. The later Cunarcters make a special feature of their shower and needle baths. What aids to comfort can, indeed, be said to be lacking? The Amerlka, for exam ple, introduced trained hospital nurses, whose presence should prove useful In case of Illness at sea. Again, there are boats which carry a coiffeur de dames. Other boats offer day nurseries for chil dren. Photographers may generally reckon on finding a dark room at hand. Another idea Is a florist's shop on board ship, where fresh flowers can be had every day. How it Is done Is a mystery, but there it is. In mid-Atlan tic charming bouquets can be bought as easily as In Bond street. A New Invention Another little invention for the ben efit of passengers has- lately been brought out by Director yon Helmolt Pen Sketches W. F.

The innovation id only an illustration of the anxiety that Is shown to add to the comfort of passengers, and to ren der an Atlantic voyage agreeable. Where it will all end It Is Impossible to say. You can have everything done for you on board the modern steam ship. lfI If you are a person given to writing letters you find a stenographer waiting for you, ready to take them down and to present them to you later on In clear-out typewriting. If you are go lng to travel about the continent you can take advantage of the Nord deutscher Lloyd system of travelers checks, whereby drafts payable In nil the principal cities can be secured. The purser's office, too, the counterpart of the bin run of the modern hotel. nffords a safe deposit for the preservation of valuables. There are those who say that the possibilities of the great At lantic liners are still by no moans ex hausted, and that in many ways we are destined to see further advance. But oven If things stop where they are, the traveling public will have cause for gratitude, for ocean traveling on the Atlantic has not only lost near all Its terrors, but has in many ways become the embodiment of luxury. » » > IN 

REPLY TO REV. MR. BRUCE Christian Scientists Protest Against the Language Used by the Meth. odist Ministers LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6. — TEdltor Herald]: In your Issue of the 4th ap pears nn account of the meeting of Methodist ministers at which one of the pastors, Re*. Mr. Bruce, made a number of remarks which are Incor rect and misleading, and which there fore need correction. Mr. Bruce stated that when persons became interested In Christian science they seemed to lose all their common souse and were beyond the reach of spiritual teaching. It Is unfortunate that a minister of the gospel, who should stand for tolerance and broad mindedness, should make remarks of this kind, which are clearly the result of unfamlllarlty with the subject of Christian science. That which attracts mankind to Christian science is Its high degree of spirituality and Its common sense practicability in the every-day affairs of life. Christian science offers to the dis eased nnd sinful mortal that which he hag been unable to find elsewhere, i. c., health and spirituality, and gives him a religion which can he used in a practi cal way every hour of the day, and fur thermore must be used If he Is to re main a Christian scientist. Christian science is the essential re ligion of Jesus Christ and is affording proof of the correctness of Its teaching In fulfilling the proof established by the Master, "And these signs shall fol low them that believe." It is frequently commented upon by those who are not Interested in Chris tian science that the Christian scientists as a body are good citizens, successful business men and enjoy a degree of health and morality far above the av erage, and this would indicate that Christian science teachings bring out in the lives of those who adhere to and practice them the highest degree of common sense and spirituality.

A Bad Spell In New York Persons from small towns who move to New York expecting to find this city the abiding place of universal culture and education are sometimes painfully disillusionized, says the New York Sun. Not long ago a Connecticut family moved Into a Twenty-third street flat. On the opposite side of the street was a small shop, on whose window was painted the sign, "All Standard Dairies." When preparing the first meal In the new flat the mother of the family said: "There Is a milk depot across the street. One of you children run acress and get a quart." The oldest son went across the street, but he did not get any milk. "They didn't have any," he exclaimed when he came back. "That Is a sta tionery store. They are off on their spelling. They meant 'diaries, 1 not 'dairies.' The man says people come in there every day asking for milk and he can't understand it." "Dear me," said the mother, "and this 1m New York.
