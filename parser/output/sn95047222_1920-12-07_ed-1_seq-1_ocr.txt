Washington, Dec. 7. That walk ing the streets is becoming an ex tra hazardous occupation is shown by the report of the census bu reau that 3,808 persons were killed in the year 1919 in automobile ac cidents. The death rate from au tos per 100,000 population is 14.1. This is an increase over preceding years, the rate in 1915 being 8 per hundred thousand. Youngstown, Ohio, enjoys the distinction of being the most dead ly city on the map, its mortality from auto traffic accidents being 28.5 persons per 100,000 population, but it shows a decrease from the previous year, when it was 31.9. Richmond, Va., has the lowest death rate, only 5.9, a slight In crease over 1919, however, when it was only 5.4. A gradual decrease in fatalities in the large cities of Kansas City, Mo., San Antonio and Cleveland, where traffic regulation has been vigorously enforced, indicates he possibility of .reducing accidents by intelligent effort. Commenting on the growing number of fatuities the census bureau recommends fines, revocations of license and imprisonment, as actual penalties to make traffic safer.
