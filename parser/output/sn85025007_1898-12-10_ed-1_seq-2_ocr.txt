saturday evening. dec. 1<>. 1??8. Not only every democratic, but every unprejudiced S republican mem? ber of the U. 6. House of Representa? tives should support Air. Sultzer's resc lution for an investigation of the man? agement of the late Spanish so-called war. Thst the investigation conduct? ed by Secretary Alger's commission is a transparent humbug, is patent to all intelligent men who take any interest in the matter, and the rascality in that management should be exposed in or? der to prevent others from following the example of the rascals. The irauiis in the navy and army contracts are no? torious, and it is no less plain that ap? pointments and promotions were effect? ed ty the most reprehensible aud dis? graceful means. _ It 13 now said that Mr. Porter, the apostle of the protectionists, is in favor of opening the Cuban market to ali the nations of the earth on equal term^; in other words, that he favors free trade for the CubaDS. No reasonable man objects to this, but as the Cubans hav= already cost this country three hun? dred million dollars, aud may cost it an untold number of millions more, doesn't Mr. Porter think the people who are taxed to raise all this monc\ are as deserving of the benefits of free trade as those of Cuba? Why should a few Northern manufacturers be granted a monopoly in this country by means of the protective tariff? Though there ire many more women thaD men in this country, the chief op? position to the admission of Mr. Rob? erts, of Utah, into.the U. S. House ol Representatives comes from th& wom? en, their assigned reason beiDg the fact that the man referred to has time wives, of none of whom however, he is ashamed, ami all of whom he suppons and has provided f.ir during the remain? der of their lives. If all husbands of one woman would treat their wives as well as Mr. Roberts treats the three he has, rhe womeu would have a much belter time than they now have. Not content with the annexation ol islands in all the seas, that of the main land is now seriously proposed, and Americans in Colombia, doubtless in? cited by reports from home, are al? ready talking about the annexation oi all the so-called republics bordering or the Caribbean sea. But in anuexa tion, a3 in every thing else, the United States are "progressive." Most.all na? tions proceed slowly in such uacertaii and daugerous matters, but rapidity is characteristic of Northern American:-: nor do they follow the wise advice ol Davy Crocked._ 1 he people of this country have been taught to denounce the seizun and retention of the territory that com? posed the late Kingdom of Polaud, nr.d they learned that lesson well, but the jingoes and imperialists have tau^h' them another lesson, and they nov seem tr? think that the seizure and re? tention by their country of territoty that has belonged to Spain ever since America was discovered, is worthy of the highest commendation. But there is nothing too inconsistent for modern Americans._ The effect of free schools u;>on the negroes has been so injurious in North Carolina that measures are to be taken there by which the number of them can bs reduoed, and the negroes be taught manual work, instead of social equality and bow to forge and divers other sorts of deviltry. That a little learning is a dangerous thing is a proverb more rec? ognized in the South now than ever he fore. As the white people are the suf? ferers from all the crimes of the negroes, they certainly exhibit little sense in paying for and promoting the increa.^e of crimes. To show that General Henry has no patience, with the pretense of giving free? dom to the people of the conquered provinces and allowing them the privi? lege of governing themselves, is made plain by the fact that he has created a commission, composed of U.S. army of? ficers, to try all criminal offenses with:n the limits of his command in Porto Rico. General Henry has common sense enough to know that the negroes and half-breeds of tho conquered prov? ince? cannot govern themselves. President McKinley is not only a member of the G. A. R. and of various other war organizations, but has just been elected chief of tho "Loyal League." Though opposed to the late ! so-oalled war at first, he will certainly I be recorded in history as chief of the SpaniBh war league, though the charac? ter of the men who promoted the lat? ter and have profited by it is not above reproach. Why there should be a commission to investigate and study yellow fever is what no educated physician can tell, as such investigations and studies by ex? perts in all preceding ages, and all with the same result. Such a commission would doubtless please itB members and clerkp, but nobody else. As the late so-called war has, ac- I cording to the jingoes and imperial? ist, oblite rated all sectional animosities and made the hearts of the people of the South and North beat as one, it is hoped that there may be more Southern men in Congress like Senator Vest, who has auuounced his intention of opposing the practice of allowing private pension claims, that have been rejected by the perjsion bureau, to I e rushed through both houses at the rate of one a minute. Senator Lindsay of Kentucky could follow Mr. Cleveland out of the democratic party in the interest of the gold nionometallists, but he has refused to follow him back into it, on the ques? tion of anti-imperialism. [Correspondence of tho Alexandria Gaxette.1 Washington, Dec. 10. Surgeon Havard of the regular army, who was stationed at Tampa before the troops embarked for Cuba, aud who went there with that expedition, was the tirst witness examined to day by the war Investigating commission. The wounded after the fight was over were transported to the hospitals in impro? vised litters, in wagons and in ambu? lances. It was his opinion that owing to the rough character of the country the improvised litters furnished proba? bly the best mode of transportation. In regard to medical supplies in Cuba Mujor Havard testified there was a shortage at times, but whenever he ca? bled for additional stocks the requisi tions were promptly honored by the Surgeon General at Washington. There was some delay in landing the supplies. Ttie Siboney hospital, he said, was well s ;ppiied with medicines. He was posi? tive that all the wounded after the Santiago fight were well cared for. General Flagier, chief of or.laanco, testified concerning the coast defence. Seventeen hundred and eighty-three pens.ons have been granted up to date on account of the war with Spain. Of this number 901 were given to sold? iers 741 to widows and deDendents under the general law, aud 141 to de? pendents under the law of 1890. A West Virginia democrat here to? day says the conspiracy to count in a republican majority in the legislature of his State, though the governor and oth? er prominent republican officials there are engaged in it, will not succeed; that the democrats will have control o: that body, and that ex-Senator Davis will represent that State in the Senate next March. Mr. Davis is a first cousin of Senator Gorman aud the father-ic-law of Senator Eikins. A strong efiort will be made to pass the Nicaragua canal bill at this session of Congress, but it is just as certain that as strong a oue will be made to defeat it, and its opponents hope, by means of the appropriation bills and other obstructior s they will put in its way, that they will be able to succeed. Its chief supporter is Senator Morgan, who, though a Southern democrat, now leads the jingoes and the imperialists. The pension frauds are becoming so flagrant that even the commissioner of the pension office, Mr. Evans, rank r< publican as be is, protests rt^riinst them, and says that not only the pensioners aud pension agents, but <;ven tnemedical boards appointed to examine the claimants, are engaged in them, e >IiiU Gen. Garcia, the Cuban commissioner, now here, is a sicker man to-day than he was yesterday. He has double pneu? monia, and his friends are seriously alarmed at his condition. Winter in Washington to a Cuban is a3 dangerous as summer in Cuba is to an American. The caucus of the democratic mem? bers of the House to be held to night will not, it is expected, be very pro? longed or very exciting, aa it is said that many of Mr. Bailey's opponents will not atteud. The older members of the party say they think the resolution that two thirds of the party should gov? ern the other third is good democratic doctrine and wiil be adopted without much trouble, as should be the case, as th^re is no sense in creating any more differences in the party. Gov. Kussel), of North Carolina, was one of the visitors at the White House to-day. Archbishop Irelaud called for the purpose, it was said, of discussiag the interests of the Catholic Church in the new possessions. Congressman McMillin of Tenuessee says the McKinley administration com? menced with imbecility as its most prominent characteristic, and seems to be growing worse rather than better. Secretary Sherman, he says, had pare sis; Long, nervous prostration; Alger, the same; Garry, paralysis. McKenna studied law at Columbian College after he was appointed Attorney Gen? eral, and Gage was a note sharer and not good enough republican to vote for Lo^au. Bliss and Wilson, be Eays, are able men, but the former has been put making contracts for Indian blankets and the latter to distributing garden seed. Senator Perkins of California was at the Treasury Department to-day to protest agaiust the President's recom? mendation for reciprocity with Greece, and said that such reciprocity would destroy one of California's chief indus? tries, the raising of currants. All government war vessels hereafter will be painted white. The adjournment of Congress yester? day until Monday put that body on the hands of all the departments, to the latter's no small annoyance, as all of them were crowded with ils mem? bers on the business of their constitu? ents. Congressman Eixoyoftho Alexandria dis? trict is at homo in Culpepor and is not ex? pected to return until Monday. Johu J. Wyatt was appointed postmaster at Airland, Sussex county, Virginia, to-day, v'c? Sally G. Wyatt. deceased Consular reports from nearly all foioign ccuntrios, except Great Britain, show that there is a general disposition in th-.-m all to hamper tralo with the Unit dStates. It is reported bore to-day ou tho authoritv of a republicau from tho Danville, Va., dis? trict, that Mr. Parr, the defeated republican candidate for Congress in that district, has changed his mind and will contest Mr. Swan son seat, though the latter was elected by thirty-seven hun lred msjority, and that he [ has employed as his counsel, Mr. John S. Wise aud Mr Dudley, better known as "blocks of five." Mr. bwanson dot fi't Credit thi? report, shying Mr. Parr has too much senso for it to be true. A New York paper of to-day credits Attor ney General Griggs with having expressed the opinion that in making rules and regula? tions (or tbo territory acquired through the war: "Congress is not bound by any of the limitations imposed by the constitution upon tne exorcise of its power over the States " Mrs. Laura Swiff, wife of a clergy, man, and Mrs. Sarah Raymond wife of the secretary of the American Safe De posit Company, was arrested in New York to-day for shop-lifting.

GREAT FALLS PROPERTY. At a meeting of the House committee on the District of Columbia yestenUy it was agreed to report favorably the bill providing for the purchase by the United States, by condemnation pro? ceedings, of the land in the vicinity of Great Falls, on the Potomac, whict i. not already owned by the government. It is believed the bill will pass the House, as it has already passed the Sen? ate, in a somewhat different form. It is in charge of Representative King, who has long been an enthusiastic advocate of more and better water for the city of Washington. The United States now owns the Maryland side of the falls, and wishes to secure the other side, eo there will be no more controversy over the rights to the water supply and power at that point. It is believed the propertv can be secured for a price ranging* from $300,000 to $500,000. In addition to securing an increased water supply for Washington, it is de? sired that the United States shall be in a position to utilize the water power at the falls, if it should ever wish to do so, for power to illuminate the streets and public building of Washington, Toere is ample power there for that at present, and even enough to run the electric roads and furnish electricity for other purposes. The possession of the facili? ties for such a plant would render the government less subject to the extor? tionate demands of the electric lighting corporations. The bill may meet with opposition from electric companies, as well as from others who hope to secure the power for private use?. Its passage would be a severe blow to those who cherish the hope that Washington is some day to become a great manufac? turing centre. EXECUTION OF A NEGRO. The nerve of Jordan Webb, the ne gro who was hanged yesterday, stayed with him till the end. The hangman's trap fell at 1:31 o'clock in the afternoon at Courtland, the coun ty seat of Sout? hampton. Ia twelve minutes the doc? tors agreed that Webb was dead. The body was cut down and shipped to a medical college in Richmond. Webb sold his remains some time prior to death. The anticipated interference with the execution on the part of a mob did not materialize The authorities were fully prepared for any attack, as it had been reported the negroes ol SouLhamp- j ton and some from North Carolina j would make an organized effort to stay j the execution. Until twenty minutes from the time Webb ascended the scaf? fold he maintained his innocence. The hopelessness of his case was finally im? pressed on him by spiritual advisers and others, and just before going up Webb confessed his crime and said he felt better. His crime consisted in as? saulting Mrs. Lucy Bowden, 65 years old, at Sunset, September-28 of this year. He met her in a lonely forest and beat her to earth when she resist? ed. Mrs. Bowden's aged husband, Billie Bowden, seventy years old, has since died. Fifty May be Lost at Sea.

The hanging occured just within the mess hall soon after midnight. THE SPANIARDS AND THE MAINE. A dispatch from Paris says the Span? iards continue making bitter comments concerning President McKinley's refe j rence to the Maine. When a corre? spondent approached Senor Garnicn, of the Spanish commission, for details of the treaty, he said: "The fact that you represent ail the American and Eoclish papera is really a reason why I should say nothing. But what you sbow me as having been cabled is sub? stantially correct. Tne exact numb?r of articles is still undetermined. It depends upon how Secretaries Oj?da and Mooro divide the treaty. It may be that there will be twelve or twenty articles. The Americans are to pay the indemnit y within three months of the ratification. We shall appoint consuls in Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philip? pine islands without delay. The Cu bau consul will be accredited to the powers that be." Asked why the Spaniards refused to grant the L'nited States a coaling sta? tion in the Caroliuo islands, Senor Gar nica said: "The Americans could hardly expect that we should agree to discuss matters outside of the protocol, after the les? sons we' have had from them on this print." "When we wished to discuss ihe Cu? ban debt they absolutely refused to consider it, and then they asked U3 for whatever they want. Quelle toupet ! (What cheek :) Yet the Cuban debt re? mains an important question for ?iettle ment." In regard to the Spaniards' final pro? test on tho subject of the Maine, Senor Garuica remarked: "That protest row becomes history, as it is embodied in the protocol. We do not wish to remain under nn impu? tation which would perpetuate animos? ity and hatred against her, and which would be a source of constant irritation in Spain. It is neither loyal nor just that this thing shouid hang over the reputation of Spain. We cannot sub? mit to it. It must be cleared up, in justice to ourselves. There are many other causes to bring hatred between the two nations, witnout the addition of such a one as this. "A3 to the future relations of the two countries, ihat is one of the things history alone can determine. Many nations which have been deadly ene? mies are speedily reconciled." Senor Garuica was then questione 1 as to the future of the Philippines, and he said : "The United States has inaugurated a policy which will bring it much trou ble and many responsibilities. The Americans are not prepared for the work they are about to undertake. Your democratic system must inaugu? rate an imperialistic and bureaucratic system, and you must increase your army and navy, with the result that there will be constant friction between yourselves and the European powers." The Americans preserve secrecy re? garding the terms of the treaty. This is partly through the influence of the three Senators on the body, who repre? sent that it would be discourtesy to the Senate to publish the terms before the treaty is presented to that body by the President. The protocol of the treaty will almost reach the dimensions of a volume, a3 it will contain every written statement presented on both sides during the conferences. The Spaniard? made a last contribution yesterday on the as? sembling of tho commissions. Senor Montero Rios then presented a vigor? ously-worded protest, in which the Spaniards declared that they had yield? ed to force, but that they invoked the conscience of the nations against the abuse ofthe rights of nations of which they were the victims. This protest was for purposes of record, and consist? ed of an argument in support of every concession demanded by theSnaniards, and which the Americansre'used, some of them peremptorily and without an opportunity for discussion. The pro? test concluded: "But these concessions which we are obliged to make touch us less than the insult which has been inflicted on our nation by President McKinley in his message. We again protest solemnly against the accusation hurled against us iu connection with the Maine, and we intend again to submit the question to an international tribunal, comprised of England. France and Germany, to determine who shall bear the responsi? bility of the castastropbe."
