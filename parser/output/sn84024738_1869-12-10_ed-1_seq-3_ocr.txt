Washington, December S, I860, t'ho measure of Senator Stewart, of JS> a, for general amnesty, and the bill offered to-aaj by Senator Ferry for a repeal th, tost-oath, were both talked over ves tcrday in caucus, and it was found that tHose attendence were about equally divided regard to the more just turn which qewa'vt and Ferry arc disposed to take. It to be seen, however, that there are Kadicftls opposo " letting up " on the South ireAUse they fear it will lose the States to Republican party. Tnunbuir* proposition that members of t oncress be not allowed, except in certain ...... to sohct appointments to office, or to Commend persons for official appoint meats, will not go through. This particu lar prerogative of members of Congress is ' ? to be dispensed with, and Senator Trumbull will not lind a responsive echo to I . .elf-denying principles. The various propositions concerning the ,? ho of Georgia are to be carefully cou riered by their respective originators and . : -, rged into one bill, which will soon be ? > .fled from the Judicary Committee. fberc is considerable discussion among Republican senators in regard to the effect jhe adoption of the fifteenth amendment w ill have in the construction of the four teenth. recently adopted. The fourteenth, it will be recollected, gives the States the : lit to resulate suffrage, but provides that It any portion of the population is excluded from the right of suffrage that that class .ball be deducted from the number entitled to representation. In other words, the number of members in Congress to which s Mate shall be entitled shall be based upon tht number of the class entitled to vote by the laws of the State. The fifteenth amend ment confers the right of franchise upon ail races and colors regardless of State laws; .!. 1 in this respect is in direct opposition to the fourteenth amendment, already adopt The qustion is, Can a portion of the t institution be repealed by tlie adoption of :;n amendment ? Some very able men think net. At any rate, it seems to be conceded th it the fifteenth amendment, if it can re : 7/. repeals the whole fourteenth amend ment, and with it the disability clause, which has rendered rt so onerous and ob jectionable.

A \\ :i>hiBgton correspondent of the New York Journal of Commerce now again states :h it. notwithstanding positive assurances to ! he contrary, reiterated time and again,there are the best grounds for belief that the Sib prime Court of the United states has de c! .ed the legal-tender act unconstitutional. He adds: " Men of prominence who in clined to this belief previously, have, since the reading of the President's message, been convinced.*' "What does that return to -pecie payments mean?" asks one. "Sim ple that t he legal-tender act is unconstitu tional, and the Supreme Court has forced the recommendation," was the answer. '? Let them decide as we know they will decide, and where will we be ? " These re marks occurred among the congressional linanciers of the Republican persuasion, and have ca-t a gloom over those who have pet theories to advance. These theories are nu merous, and it i< added that a careful can v. in both Houses shows that the upper mo.-t theme now is the finances. Uniformity in Electing Members of Congress.? The Washington correspondent of the New York Herald, in his dispatches on Tuesday, says : ?? The Committee of Elections have agreed upon a bill which provides that the day for holding elections for members of Congress -hail be uniform throughout all the States. As it will require some change in the laws oi several of the States to conform to this ai t, the bill provides that it shall not take effect until the first Tuesday in November, l>72. The bill has two objects?first, to in sure a full representation of all the States at the organization of each new Congress on the 4th of March; and second, to prevent persons from one State going into another to colonize. It is thought that having the oiurres-ional elections going on in all the Mate- on the same day, every district will tind enough to do at home without going to help their neighbors.''

There have been twenty-five counterfeit coupons of the ten-forty boiicis of March 1st, 1mA, paid in at the Treasury Department. A plate of this denomination was stolen, and a careful examination of the coupons paid shows that the numbers were not oulv duplicates, but triplicates and quadrupli cates. .Since the discovery was made, the greatest care has been exercised by the Treasury officials, and the fraud checked. It is clever in the President, and flatter ing to the people, to open his budget on foreign affairs with the vivid and original observation that " the United States is the freest of all nations.'' Hence, we sympa thise with all people " struggling for liberty and self-government."

Affairs in Virginia?Report of Gene ral C'anby.?General Canby's report for Virginia embodies statements relative to the recent elections, asks the additional appro priation for reconstruction purposes of I ^65,000, and has the following of general in terest : One of the most important duties de volving on the district commander, after 1 assumed tiie command on April 20, 1809, was that of making appointments to fill the vacancies in the civil offices created by the operation of the joint resolution of Con'gres of February 19, J 809. The total number of j civil officers in the State affected by that reso lution was ti,061, and of this number only SSTi were found in office Who could qualify under the law of July 2,1S62, leaving o,176 appointments to l>e made. To the 1st of October, instant, 3,070 appointments have been made, and of these 708 have declined, resigned, been removed, or have failed to qualify, leaving 2,362 now iu office and 2,8-14 vacancies. From the first it was found very difficult to find suitable persons who were willing to accept offices the duties of which inter fered with their ordinary business, or occa sioned a good deal of trouble, and yielded 110 compensation. Another embarrassment resulted from the social and political pres sure that was brought to bear upon nearly all native Virginians who were suggested or recommended for an office that involved the necessity of taking the oath of office prescribed by the law of July 2, 1862. At this time, however, it is believed that every county has a sufficient number of qualified magistrates to organize and hold its regular courts, and, with fe.vv exceptions, county organization is so far completed as to be in working condition.

TELEGBAPHIC NEWS. LATEST WASHINGTON NEWS. Debate before the Reconstruction Committee of the Delegates from the Different Organizations and from the Virginia legislature?^Commit tee Adjonmed to Meet To-Morrow? Virginia will Probably be Admit ted on Monday or Tuesday. Special telegram to the Dispatch. Washington, Docember 9,18G9. At 10 o'clock this morning the House Committee on Reconstruction assembled in their rooms at the capitol. There was a full attendance of the committee. General Butler (chairman) announced that several committees were waiting to state their ?views and present" memorials in reference to the admission of Virginia. A motion to admit them all was agreed to. The committee representing the Legisla ture, headed by Mr. Speaker Turner, and accompanied by Governor Walker; the committee representing the Radical wing of the Republican Convention, headed by Congressman Porter, and accompanied by Messrs. Humphreys, Maddox, Ward well. Morrissey, of Richmond, and several co lored men ; and the committee representing the Conservative or bolting portion of the late Republican Convention, headed by Congressmen Piatt and Ayers, and accom panied by Mr-V. A. Witcher, J. Bland (co lored, a member of the State Senate,) Hine, and others, were the thrpe committees ad mitted. Mr. Porter presented an address of the Radical wing of the late Convention, in which were embraced a series of resolutions passed by that wing and a memorial pray ing that Virginia be not admitted until an other election shall he held and the test oath taken by members of tlie Legislature and other ofiicers elected, etc. Speaker Turner presented the memorial of the Legislature, which was given in de tail in these dispatches of yesterday. Mr. Hine, chairman' of the bolters' or minori ty's committee, presented a resolution on behalf of the members of the convention whom he represented. The resol utions, or memorial, ask for the early admission ;ot the State, and that members of the Legisla ture only be required to take the oath ot office as'prescribed by the reconstruction laws. They left the reconstruction of these laws to Congress, and did not advocate the iron-clad oath. Mr. Porter was the first to speak, and he made a vehement and earnest speech ; pro tested against the admission of the State at this time; insisted upon the iron-clad oath being administered ; was opposed to the total amnesty idea, and insisted that the wing of the Republican party which he represented was the only true and loyal party in the State ; and that the school sys tem and jury clause of the Constitution would not be carried out in good faith. He cited an instance which lately occurred in one of the counties where the sheriil had summoned a mixed jury and the Stale judge refused to swear them in on the ground that colored juries were incompati ble with the laws of the State. Mr. Butler here interrupted the speaker, and, turning to Governor Walker, asked ii such was the case. Governor V\ alker an swered that he did -not know, hut thought perhaps it might be so, as the State was not aow being governed uuder the new Consti tution, but under the old laws, and said that is just what we are waiting for, Gene ral ; to have you approve and accept our Constitution. Mr. Porter continued his remarks at some length, being earuest to the end that the State should not be admitted unless there was another election or the reassembling of the Legislature, nud all required to sub scribe to the iron-clad oath, and those who could not do so should stand aside, and the next highest on the legislative tickets be admitted to the Legislature, etc. Speaker Turner then made a few re marks, stating that he was no politician nor member of any party or wine; but he pre sented the memorial of the Legislature in good faith, aud was sure that every provi sion of her Constitution would be strictly carried out. Mr. John B. Crenshaw, member of the Legislature from Richmond city and Hen rico, then made a brief and eloquent speech, ne had been a Union man from the begin ning of the late war, and had been a Re publican since the Old-Line Whig party disbanded. He knew that he spoke the earnest sentiment of the legislative body of which he was a member, and for whom he now spoke as one of a committee for ^bom he pledged that the new Constitution in all its provisions would be faithfully carried out. Governor Walker, on behalf of the peo ple and as their chosen Chief Executive, assured the committee that the Constitution should be carried out to the very letter. He claimed to be a much older Republi can than many of the Reconstruction Com mittee. He stated that it was he who gave to Senator Stewart, of Nevada, the original draft and idea of the fifteenth amendment bill. The fourteenth and fifteenth amend ments had been adopted; and one of the best State constitutions in the country had been adopted almost unanimously by the voters of his State. All the reconstruction laws had been complied with. Fair elec tions had been held, and the action of the State approved by the President. For his own part, he had not a doubt but that the committee would do Virginia justice, and report a bill for her admission at the earliest practicable moment. 3tr. Wardwen,ifarmerly one of General Butler's stuff officers, and now superintend- J ent of the State penitentiary, protested against the admi'Mon ot the State* and co incided with the views of Congressman Porter. Messrs. Humphreys and Maddox, of the Convention committee, also pro tested against the admission of the State. Congressmen Piatt and Ayers, and Mr. Hine, or the bolters'' wing of the late Con vention, spoke in favor of the early admis sion of the State. On motion of Mr. Apson, of Michigan, Mr. Bland (colored State Senator) was in vited to give Ills views. Bland is abont twenty-eight years of age, and quite black. His eloquent speech before the committee not only surprised them but his colleagues. He staled in detail his reasons for bolting from the late Republican Convention in Rich mond. He desired it to be distinctly under stood that he was a Republican, had always been, and would continue to be, while that party was the friend of his race. He thanked the Republican party for the freedom they had given his race, and the equal rights which had been accorded them. He was the warm advocate of the present State Constitution, and was proud that he was an humble instrument in framing it, and of its final adoption by the people of his native State. He was satisfied nineteen twentieths of the people of all colors and localities in Virginia were daily praying for the speedy admission of the State. It was but a few designing men who, to carry out some personal schemes, were opposed to the admission of the State as at present or ganized. He was opposed to the test-oath, or iron-clad oath, as it is called. General Butler: "Why are you opposed to the test-oath ?" Bland: "Because I do not consider it fair or consistent. The people of Massa chusetts or Pennsylvania can take the test oath, for they were all in the North during the war, while men of Virginia were nearly ! all with the South, and to insist upon their taking the test-oath is simply to ostracise nearly nine-tenths of the white men of the State*, the larger number of whom were now good Union men.' Ho was sure he spoke the sentiments of a large majority of the colored men of A ir ginia when he expressed the earnest hope and p'raycr that Virginia be at once admit ted into the union of States. A general conversation ensued between the members of the Reconstruction Com mittee. General Butler then announced that the committee would meet Saturday morning and receive the committee again. It was agreed to allow Beckley (colored), from Alexandria, to reply to Bland's speech on Saturday, but the committee ordered that all others who would have anything to say must present it in writing. The committee then adjourned. The Porter faction is sure the test-oath will be required, and that the State will not now hp admitted. They have Wardwell with them, and he is represented as a warm per sonal friend of General Butler, and as having much influence with him. Porter insists that his speech to-day set tled the matter, and he will carry his point. Butler wants the State admitted, and I think the weight of his influence will speed ily bring about the result. The Legislative Committee arc confident. They have pre sented a memorial and pledge, as previously approved l>v General Butler, and feel sure he will remain true to his assurances given to thera a few days since. It was observed to-day that Representa tive Farnsworth, of Illinois, was one of the most desirous in the committee to have the bill for the admission <>f the State presented at once. lion. Fernando V ood expressed the opinion that he did not believe a single member of the committee would vote (in committee) against a bill of admission du ring the session of the committee. General Butler has given no opinion -pro or con., but was exceedingly courteous to all parties. In an interview with Gen. Butler he stated that there was now no doubt about the 9peed\ admission of the State of Virginia. He said we onlv require a guarantee that the school system and the jury clause embraced in the Constitution be strictly carried out. He said, emphatically, we don't care a fig about test-oaths; wc only want the guaran tee ; and then there is no doubt about the State being at once admitted. When re minded that* the pledge guaranteeing the faithful carrying out of the provisions ol the new Constitution had been given to the Reconstruction Committee to-dav, he said ? Yes, I know ; that is all right, and I don't think there will be any more trouble about it. We will be sure, though, to provide that there be no more Georgia tricks plaved." He then spoke in complimentary terms of Bland, the young colored man who addressed the committee to-day, and re marked, "I hear that he was formerly identified with the Democratic party, but," laughing, "that is no great matter." It is the general opinion here to-night that the admission of the State of "V irginia will be accomplished next Monday or Tues day. Wallace. The Admission of Virginia?Speeches before the Reconstruction Commit tee by Governor Walker, Speaker Turner, Porter, Piatt, and others. Special telegram to the Dispatch. Washington, December 9, 1869. My telegram of yesterday incorrectly in cluded Speaker Turner among those re lieved of disabilities. F. B. Stovall, Paul Adams, and H. A. C'arrington, are the only persons from Halifax and Charlotte in cluded in the bill. The scene before the Reconstruction Com mittee was disorderly and undignified in the extreme. Each of the three committees from Virginia presented written addresses, and more thap a dozen stump-speeches were made. The Wickham, Porter, and General As sembly Committees were all before the Re construction Committee at the same time. Hine, of the Wickham Committee, spoke first, and though he desired the admission of Virginia, yet he wanted the " iron-clad" applied. Porter followed in a foul-mouthed tirade against the State and her people, and said his life and every Union man's life in Vir ginia were unsafe, lie swore that he had been guarded by negro Republicans with muskets iu their bunds wherever he spoke in the recent canvass; had frequently had pistols drawn on him; that Bocock incited the negroes to it; made a huge handle of Judge WeisigeFs exclusion of negroes from the jury-box; called Stoneman and Scho field disloyal; and wound up by frantically asking that Virginia be not admitted at all. Ward well'8 tirade was even worse than Porters. In the name of himself, Mrs. Wardwell, the little Wardwells, and all the inmates of the penitentiary,?who, he thanked God, he had taught to mix politics with their prayers?he demanded that the iron-clad should be applied to the members of the Virginia Legislature, and especially to the superintendent of the penitentiary who would soon succeed him. Speaker Turner then presented the ad dress of his committee in appropriate terms, and Friend Crenshaw followed him in remarks that must have been convincing. Governor Walker, after some further re marks from Iiine and Porter of the same sort, manfully and ably vindicated Virgi nia's people and her, claims to immediate admissioii. Piatt, of Petersburg, advocated the lm? mediate admission of tho State, and wanted do iron-clad. Porter pitched into Piatt, and was in turn pitched into by Bland (ne gro), when the hour of 12 having arrived, Porter begged that the committee would hear him farther. The committee fixed 10 A. M. Saturday for further discussion, when Colonel W. W. Wood, at the request of the committee of the Legislature, will reply to Hinc and Porter. Robert W. Hughes is here, and will also, in connection with General Walbridge and others of the National .Board of Trade, re cently In session in' your city, go before the Reconstruction Committee and urge the immediate unconditional admission of the State. The Senate has adjourned until Monday. Governor Walker will not return until Saturday night. W. The Admission of Virginia.

It was referred to the Judiciary Committee. Senate.?Nothing was done in the Senate this morning. Mr. Kellogg introduced a bill incorpo rating the Mississippi Valley Levee Coiu Eany according to the plan proposed by the otiisville Convention. The Committee on the District of Colum bia was directed to inquiro into the pro priety of repealing the charter of the Medi cal Society for having rejected negro mem bers. Mr. Trumbull reported from the Judi ciary Committee, with amendments, a bill relating to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The bill, as amended, de clares that the judicial power of the United States gives no power to the courts to de cide upon political questions, and that it rests with Congress to decide what Govern ment is the established one in any State; it prohibits the Supreme Court from enter taining jurisdiction of any case growing out of the execution of the reconstruction acts until the Government of the late rebellious States are recognized by Congress as valid ; it repeals all act9 authorizing the Supreme Court in habeas corpus proceedings; the President is directed to hold and proceed with all prisoners held in said States by military commission, without regard to any civil proceedings or authority whatever.
