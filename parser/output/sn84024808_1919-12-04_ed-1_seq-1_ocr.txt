PEACE BY RESOLUTION HITS SNAG WHEN HOUSE REPUBLICANS OBJECT; FAVOR REPEAL OF WARTIME LAWS Washington, Dec. 3.—The plan of republican senate lead ers to declare a state of peace by concurrent resolution of con gress has struck a snag in the house. Chairman Porter, of the foreign affairs committee, said his committee had no intention of reporting out such a reso lution and it was indicated that house leaders supported this position. The position taken by the house republicans was said to be that repeal of the war-time legislation, which extends until peace is established, would be a more acceptable method of restoring normal conditions, and that the question of peace was one which the president and the senate, constituting the treaty making power, should determine. The stand of the house republican leaders was accepted as at least blocking the plan of republican senators to have the house act first on a peace resolution. In the senate such a res olution had been presented by Senator Lodge, the republican leader, and now is in the hands of the foreign relations com mittee.

The speaker called "order", but Lady Astor, unaware she was addressed, continued talking. Thereupon the speaker raised his voice and repeated his warning. Lady Astor turned around, realized her offense, stepped quickly beyond the bar and continued her conversa tion there. OF

He said that, undoubtedly, there was a very great need in Europe for financial assistance, but that the situatioin had been mum exaggerated. Financing Europe Exporters' Task. "We must all feel deep sympathy for Europe today," he said.

Senator Fall conferred at length with Henry 1*. Fletcher, American ambassador, who for some months had been handling Mexican affairs at the state department. The department's archieves have been open ed to the foreign relations committee without reservation and members of the committee said there existed a com plete understanding with the depart Democrats May Oppose.

"The United States has had ample occasion to declare war against Mexico for the last five years."

More Drastic Steps Possible. lteports from Mexicali that a British subject seized by bandits has been fjuick iy released on demand of the British authorities did not serve to soften the feeling in official circles, especially as everybody recalled that Great Britain never had recognized the Carranza gov ernment. There was much discussion among senators and representatives as to what would happen in event the Fall resolu tion was passed and ignored by the president. While declining to express their views on the subject, some mem bers intimated that it. might force even more drastic steps by congress. I. W. W.

HOLDING CHIEF FOR A REWARD Two Insurrecto Couriers Bring Story of Decision of Harrassed Freebooters to Turn Over Leader for 50,000 Pesos Offered. Juarez, Dec. 3. —Francisco Villa has been captured by a force of his own men and is being held for a reward from the Mexican government, according to advices received here by Superintendent Caballero, of the Chihuahua division of the National Railways of Mexico. Two Villa rebels are reported to have presented themselves at the federal headquarters at Parral and notified the Carranza authorities that Villa had been captured and was being held for surrender to the Carranza forces. The state of Chihuahua has already offered 50,000 pesos as j a reward. Details of the bandit's capture have not been learned here. It is understood that a large number of federal soldiers are on their way to the place indicated in Parral. If Not, Will Be Caught. I Vigorous efforts ar e being made by civil and military offi- : cials here to obtain official information regarding the reported capture of Villa. Up to 7:30 o'clock no confirmation of the report 1 been received General J. Ganzalo Escobar, commander of the Juarez dis 1 trict, said that he had dispatched a telegram to General Manuel M. Dieguez, who has a force of 17,000 operating in the norther n ! ! "If Villa has not been captured now—and I have strong ; hopes that he ha s been—he will be caught soon—within two months at the outside," General Escobar said. 5000 in Pursuit. Galveton.

Washington, Dec. .'Î, —''Adjustment and arbitration" will be th • first subject considered by the second industrial con fcrence. After exhaustive discussion of the rec ommendation made Tuesday by President Wilson in his message to congress and a tentative program prepared bv Herbert Hoover, vice chairman .with the assist ance of other delegates, the conference decided that means for peaceable settle ment of industrial disputes should head the list of work to be done. The object will have numerous divisions, including establishment of a permanent tribunal to maintain industrial peace, all of whieli will be studied from every angle before \ the final report, is ready. j It became evident from the work start- j ed that the conference will require sev- I eral weeks, at least, to complete the j enormous task mapped out. The strenu- i ous pace set in the first, three days of : work will be continued, and next week's j program will depend on how fast the ! data requested from various government j >(a I. .... f»- ■ - i mix ill , departments can be prepared for the i delegates. The part of the program already is said to contain the most pressing sut» jects of the present situation, including collective bargaining, hours of labor, and ! wages. President Wilsons message to congress was analyzed by the delegates for subjects to be discussed and each was given a place along with the sub jeets -u oposed by Mr. Hoover. he j delegates then debated how far they , should go in studying each subject and ; sel* ted those on which expert auvice or, writenjrtata were desired, | ■ different from others daily turned out of so-called fashionable tailoring houses. Wearers of the suits, however, seemed , pr0U( , fo exhjbit thp in ^ j(lp of fh ; coar to friends and strangers in the cafes and i theater lobbies. There is one thing alone which the national garment differs from others, and that is the price as the suit sells for 110 francs. At the present rate of exchange, the price of the "national costume". 110 francs, is the equivalent of about $11 , in American money. M
