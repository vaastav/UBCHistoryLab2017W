An interesting story i read is: "The Necklace of Truth." There was once a little girl named Pearl, who had a bad habit of tell- j ing untruth.-?. For a long tim her parents did not know this. At last ' they found that she very often suid . things that were not true. j Now at this time there lived a wonderful man named Merlin. He could do such strange things, and wan so ery wise, that he was called a vizard. Merlin was a great lover of truth. For this reason children who told untruth- were of'cn brought to him, so that he might cure them of their f it. "Lot us take our child to the won derful wizard." said Pearl s father. And the mother said. "Yes. let us take her to Merlin. He will cure ! her!" .o pearl's parents went to the glass ,aiace where Merlin lived. When they reached Merlin's palaco the wise old man said: "I know very well what is the matter with j your child; she does not love the truth." Poor Pearl hung her head with shame and fear. Put Merlin said: "Vo not be afraid, I am only going to make you a present." Then the wizard opened a drawer and took from it a lovely necklace with a diamond clasp. This he put on Pearl's neck, and told her pa rents to go home happy, for tho lit tle jrirl would Foon be cured. As they were solnsr away. Merlin looked at Pearl and raid: In a vear from now I shall come for my necklace. Till then you must not dare to take it off." The next day Pearl went to ?chool. "When her schoolmates saw it, they crowded around her. "Oh. what a lovely necklace! Where did you get it. Pearl?" "My father gave it to me for a Christmas present." said Pearl. "Oh. look, look!" cried the chil dren, "the diamond has turned dim.: Pearl looked down at her neck Uce and saw that the lovely clasp was tunica to coarse glass. Then she was very much afraid and sail: "I will tell you tue truth. The Wizard Merlin gave it to me." At once the diamond bright as before. was as ' The children now began to laugh because they knew that only chil dren who told falsehoods were sent to Merlin. "You need net laugh," said Pearl. "Merlin sent a lovely coach to bring us. It was drawn by six white horse, and was lined with s.uln." h"he stopped, for all the children were lauchlng acrain. Then she looked at her necklace.

SECOND PRIZE. Ry I-cvi Llml, Franklin School. One of the most interesting stor ies I have read is. "A Tale of Two Cities," by Charles Dickens, a prom inent English author. It is an epi sode of the French Revolution. It is also about two lovers. The scenes are laid in those two cosmopolitan cities, Paris and London. The time is in the ISth century, The foundation of the s story is the French revolution. that historic event, when the hunger-maddened French peasants rose in rebellion against the aristocracy. They first stormed the Pastile, a fortress, also a prison and easily conquered the small garrison. S'uon many rich nobles were ex ecuted by means of the guillotine. Louis, the XIV, was also executed by the same means. Put the revolution is not all. A rich French nobleman, the hero of the story, is in love with a young rnL,Ii:sh girj In the reign of terror, as the lat ter part of the revolution was call ed, her lover is sent to prison by the rebels, condemned to die. The girl is frantic A young English friend of the nobleman, named Carlton, resolves to save the young nobleman. One point in his favor is that he is the exact counterpart of the nobleman. ' o he goes to the prison where the young lover is con fined, contrives to get in, and sent the lover away a's himself. He stays ! in place of the lover. On the morrow he is lear, out to the guillotine, where he meets his death bravely. It is a story everyone should read It Js, a cias5jC. Much credit is due its author for giving to the such a piece of literature. world THIRD PRIZE. By Anna R. Pinter, Kaley School. IThe most interesting story I ever read was about the Teutons and the j Romans. I like it because it tells t how brave the Romans were at first. ; Put after a while they had their ; slaves and became lazy. I think that if people would read the story about the Romans it would teach them to do their own work. If you have read their story you know what became of them after they began to use slaves. I will tell ',M A V,l11 f it They became lazy and when the! Parbarians began to make war aK;lin5t them they were unwilling to fight. Some of them cut off their fmgers so they would not have to tight. They hired the Germans or Teutons to fight for them. They had to pay them, of course. So to get the money they taxed the peo ple. The Teutons fought for them, but they tricked the Romans by sending messages to their kinsmen, telling them how they could win the war. If a country does not do its work it win become lazy like the Roman., re destroyed by enemies. . COQUILLARD SCHOOL Henry MrXhh nd Hild Rby, Kdltor. ROOM ONE.
