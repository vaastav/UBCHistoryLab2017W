CONDEMNED BY THEIR OWN ORGAN. •' The arbitrary action of the Democratic majority of the Board of Supervisors at the last 'meeting is censured by the lone "Echo," their own organ, as follows: [>■ " POOR DEMOCRACY. " " The action of the Democratic members of the Board of Supervisors at this month's meeting, the first of the week, was, to speak with as much charity as possible, very extraordinary and high handed. Dr. Endicott, county physician and health officer, and R. F. Allen, county hospital superintendent, tendered their resignations to the Board, to take effect on or before the 15th of December, instead of at the next regular meeting of the Board. "Be it remembered that the terms of Dwyer and Clifton, Democrats, and Brinn, Republican, will ex-' .-. ./. pire on January 7th, twenty-three days after the res ignations were timed to take effect. The Republican members of the Board opposed the acceptance of the resignations as they were and suggested that the of ficers tendering them be asked to substitute January 7 for December 15, as the date in the resignations. This would protect the resigners against being 'kick ed out,' and would also show the good intent of the retiring Board and resigning officers to the incoming Board, and leave the selection of their successors to the new Beard which will organize on January 7th — their rightful prerogative. "The resignations were- accepted, however, by the following vote: "Ayes— Dwyer, Clifton, McLaughlin, Denio " Noes — Brinn,- LeMoin, Republicans. ■ "Then LeMoin made the same motion which was •59? defeated by the Democratic members of the Board at . the June meeting, after being laid over from the May session—that the office of health officer be abolished, and the Democratic members showed their full change of heart since that 'necessary' office has passed into the hands of the Republicans, by voting to abolish it." q% CALIFORNIA PRESS ASSOCIATION.

EVERY DOLLAR EQUIVALENT TO GOLD. "The party in power is committed to such legislation as will better, make the currency responsive to the varying needs of business at all seasons and in all sections," says President McKinley in his message. Yes, and every dollar will be equivalent to gold. •? .v. v . vThe Isthmian Canal Commission in its report submitted to the President and by him to Congress, states that "the most practicable and feasible route for an isthmian canal under the control, management and ownership of the United States, is that known as the Nicaragua route. The com mission estimates the cost of this; route at $200,540,000, be ing much in excess of any heretofore made, but it is due to increased dimensions and other features not heretofore con sidered. The commission also estimates the cost of a canal by the Panama route at $142,342,579, according to one route, or $156,378,258 according to another route. As between the Nicaragua and Panama route, the commission sums up a number of advantages favorable to the former." 

REFERRING to the Chinese trouble, President McKinley says, in his message: "Due compensation may be made in part by increased guarantees of security for foreign rights and immunities, and, most important of all, by the opening of China to the equal commerce of the world." Military con trol of the Philippines, he points out, is imperative until the rebellion is ended. Civil government, meanwhile, is to be organized by the commission in the larger administrative di visions of the islands, as far as this can be safely done. The Water and Forest Convention, in session at San Francisco, is one of intense interest to the people of the State, and its deliberations will be awaited with interest. THE 

AMADOB LEDGER; JACKSON, CAIiIFORmA, FRIDAY. DECEMBER 14, 1900. RULING ON LIEN LAW. Judge Belcher, of Ban Francisco, Makes an Important Decision. In the Superior Court of San Fran cisco Judge Belcher filed an opinion last Monday, that will come as a sur prise to the legal fraternity. The ef fect of the decision is to virtually de clare unconstitutional Section 1194 of the Code of Civil Procedure which re lates to mechanic's lions. The opinion sets aside the practice of years, and if sustained by the Supreme Court will make quite a difference in future pro cedure. The section in question provides for the rank of liens against property in the following order: 1. All persons performing manual labor in, on or about the same. 2. Persons furnishing materials. 3. Sub-contractors. 4. Original contractors. And in case property Is sold to satisfy liens the proceeds must be applied in that order, inslead of pro rata. In the case at bar several lien holders embracing the classes given adove, had consolidated their suits, in order to test the validity of the law. In ren dering- his opinion Judge Belcher said : "In this consolidated case the first and second classes would take all of the fund, leaving nothing for the third and fourth class if the statute must be fol lowed. Certain of the lien claimants contended that the section is uncon stitutional, and in my estimation that contention Is sound. The Constitution provides (Art. XX, Sec. 15) that: "Mechanics, material men, artisans and laborers of every class shall have a lien upon the prop erty upon which they have bestowed labor or furnished materials, for the value of such labor done ani materials furnished, and the Legislature shall provide by law for the speedy and efficient enforcement of all such liens.". By this constitutional provision a direct lien is given to mechanics, material men, artisans and laborers, and nothing is left to the Legislature save the duty of enacting measures for the enforcement of the liens given. The Legislature was not authorized to declare which of these classes, to the exclusion of the others, should be paid. To the contrary, the Legislature was given power, or rather it was directed to provide by law for the "speedy and adequate enforcement' 1 of the liens al ready given. By the Constitution the liens of all the classes mentioned stand upon the same plane— are equal before the law, and the Legislature had no power to enact that one class should be paid In preference to another,' It fol lows that Sec. 1194, C. O. P., is uncon stitutional to the extent that it at tempts to create preferred classes of lien claimants. The constitutional protection is ex tended to "mechanics,* material men, artisans and laborers of every class." These protected classes do not embrace contractors or sub-contractors. Aeon tractor or sub-contractor, might chance to be skilled in the practice of some mechanic art,' but his contract or sub contract would not necessarily call for the display of mechanical ability, and therefore I do not see how either could be said to be embraced within the denomination ' 'mechanics. ' ' Certainly they are not embraced within either of the other three classes. A corporation might be a contractor or sub-con tractor, but, clearly, a corporation, in this particular, is not within the. con stitutional intendment. In my-judg ment, therefore, theliens of contractors or sub-contractors must depend upon the force and effect of the general law. All the lien claimants proved their claims, or they were admitted, and they are to be treated with perfect Many a Lover Has turned with disgust from an otherwise lovable girl with an offensive breath.
