IIio announcement comes from Wash ington, evidently by authority, that the Dingley tariff law will not be chanced In any of Its customs features at the present session of Congress. The Republican members of the ways and means commit tee have reached a general understanding to this effect. They have sense enough to know that any tnoro tariff tinkering at present is the one thing that the country noes not want. Still the cry goes up from Europe for combination against the commercial ag- gressivencss of the United States. The greater part of the speech of Baron von Thielmann, secretary of the German treas ury, in presenting the budget to the Reich- stag the other day was devoted to sugar. Ho said "the rule America played in the sugar question resembled that of a pike In a carp pond, and that the effect of the Dingley tariff had been to Increase the ne cessity for the carp to combine forces against the common enemy." The crisis has come In the Maine pro hibition war. Accredited representatives of the Maine Christian Civic league state mat tue crusade they have Inaugurated In Aroostook county Is merely preliminary to a general campaign in Maine, which will be the most sweeping and effective fight in the Interest of the Maine law ever under taken in the state. The temperance work ers will file specific charges against the county attorneys and against the sheriffs. and against others who have not been so realous and Indefatigable, from the pro hibitory standpoint, as they should have been. They will ask to have them re moved by the governor. W. W. LaPoInt of Barre, division com- uiauuer oi me oons oi veterans, urges greater care in the selection of camp offi cers: He says: "Never in tke history of me Vermont division has there been a need of better or more competent officers than for the coming year. The division has suffered a loss of many camps and hundreds of men during the year ending July 1. If the same loss was allowed to continue for two years the Vermont divi sion would be ready for Its obituary. Tho cause of this great loss was in a considera- oie uegree due to the incompetent men who were in charge of the welfare of camps. Without doubt the large majority of the suspended and disbanded camps of tne past year died because of poor men elected to act as camp dlicers." Suits have been begun in Boston to test the question whether members of assess ment Insurance companies can drop their membership at will and at the same time drop their responsibility for the Indebted ness of tlie companies. The receiver of the United States Mutual Accident asso ciation levied an assessment on past mem bers, and those who have not paid have been cited to appear in the municipal court in uoston to answer to a suit brought to recover the amounts due. The question is new In Massachusetts, but In New York it has been decided that the policy holders are holden. Whatever the decision in the lower court in Boston the casees will go to the supreme court of the state. The final determination will affect all the mutual as sessment companies, and It will be of gen eral interest to see whether it Is held that when one of these companies goes out of existence all lis past members are liable for its Indebtedness. The announcement that George W. Van- dcrbllt had taken out a life Insurance poli cy of $1,000,000 brings out tho statement that the most heavily insured American Is uouu ivanaui.-iKer, wuo uas policies ag gregating $1,025,000. The late Duko of Marlborough of England was Insured for $3,000,000. Mrs. I.eland Stanford took out a policy for $1,000,000 in favor of the Leland Stanford university in April of the present year. She is more than 71 years old. It is seldom that insurance companies take risks on persons of so great an age. Mrs. Stanford pays a yearly premium of $170,000. If she dies within ten years the university will rcceivo $1,000,- 000, while if she lives more than ten years it will receive $2,000,000. Col. Albert U. Hilton of New York is iusured for ft 1.250. - 000. The heaviest policy holder In Now England is J. R. Whipple of Young's ho tel, Boston, with $000,000. Theodore N. Vail of Lyndon carries the larcest amount of insurance of any Vcrmonter, $205,000. flan I T T.-o... !).. . ' ,. vuu u. .stcjr ui uiaiueuoro uas poli cies which represent upwards of S100.000.

POWDER Aniolutcly pure MMAtUMhO POKS CO.. N vowc Sltiintlnn nlid the Appro- prUllun., The secretary of tho treasury in his re cent report stated that the estimated rev- enuo deficit for tho present (heal year end ing Juno !10, 18!)8, would be $28,000,000; for tho fiscal year ending June :S0,189!, t-lil, (M i,000. Representative Dingley, chair man of tho ways and means committee, and Republican leader of the House, said to that body a few days later, In the course of tho debate upon the subject of the revenue: "If tho expenditures for tho next fiscal year shall not rise above $:'80, 000.00C, then, on the estimate of the secre tary of tho treasury there will be a surplus of about $10,000,000." The apparent dls agreement between these two statements or estimates arises entirely over tho ques Hon or probability as to what degree of economy or extravagance Congress will practice. It is with the estimate for the year end ing June ::0, 1800, that we have the greater Interest, for that concerns both the appro priations to be made by the present Con gress and the amount of icvenne to be yielded by the new tariff law. For that year Secretary Gage estimates the revenue at $-182,874,017.37, Including $200,000,000 from customs and $105,000,000 from Inter nal revenue. The total estimated appro priations, exclusive of sinking fund, arc figured at $501,522,533.22, leaving a deficit of $21,047,885.85. This deficit, however, Is not any more a certainty than are the estimated appropriations. Under a' man dato Included in the sundry civil bill ap proved In June last the secretary of the treasury must submit to Congress the esti mates for public works carried on by the war department exactly as he receives them and must Include them In his own compu tations of receipts and expenditures. The fact that this estimate, amounting to $05, 000,000, was overlooked, or was unknown to Mr. Dingley, when his statement was made, accounts for the discrepancy In the two statements. The New York Tribune explains and characterizes the whole situa tion when it says: "The fact remains that the responsibility for the future, both as to sufficiency of the revenue and as to possibility of strength ening the monetary system, rests just where President McKinley placed It when he urged In his message great prudence In ap propriations. It Is obvious that Uongress uas power to appropriate more money than Its revenue laws raise, and equally obvious mat a dencit, so long as it exists, involves more or less risk of distrust regarding the monetary luture. in plain words secretary Gage has shown Congress that it Is asked by the several executive departments and offices' to appropriate $21,000,000 more money than lu revenue law will probably yield next year, although that law will yield in his opinion $13,000,000 more than the government requires for its expendl turcs this current year, and $;,,4,-f00,000 more than It actually expended in the last fiscal year. Thus the whole question comes to be one of appropriations is the great Increase asked, largely exceeding the prob able revenue, necessary for the proper sup port ot me government? ' Under these circumstances it is a wel come assurance which comes from Wash ington that Speaker Reed will maintain In this Congress tho same attitude which he did In the last that of insisting that ap propriations shall be kept down, and that no schemes under tho familiar culse of puuiic improvements," out wnicn are really for Individual or local benefit, shall be allowed to come to the surface. France will spend $20,000,000 on the Ex position of 1000, presenting its capital in a blaze of glory which it has never before ap proached, and, if the thing Is possible, en tirely eclipsing the magnificent- display at Chicago. Ten million dollars Is to bo spent on the palaces in the Champs Elysdes, Champ de Mars, Esplande des Invalides, and on the Quays; $1,000,000 on tho bridges across the Seine, $1,000,000 on the electric and mechanical services, and soon. Paris will be more than ever the show place of tho world in the closing year of the century. The butter exhibited at the meetings of the Maine dairymen has always scored low er than that shown at the New Hampshire and Vermont gatherings. In mechanical working, salting auJ packing no appreci able dlllerence Is seen, but tho Maine pro duct ranks lower In llavor. Tho Maine Farmer believes that the difference Is not real but imaginary, and suggests that In 189S a joint exhibition of tho product of the dairymen of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine bo held at some central point, tho butter to be placed on exhibition in uniform trays, entirely free from distin guishing marks, privately tagged, no tag or number to be exposed, all awards to be made by the use of the score card, and the judge to be required to place upon every card his reasons for making any cut or detect in any particular. Vermont has nothing to fear from direct competition with her nelghborlne: states. She won th highest honors at the World's Fair and at the Paris exposition, and her product has been given a high mark by all of tho ex pert judges. The commissioner of pensions estimates that 200,000 pension claims are still await ing adjudication, and that half of these will be granted, adding from $5,000,000 to $7,000,000 to the present annual expendi ture. Foreseeing a constant Increase In the pension payments, duo to lalo mar riages of pensioners, tho secretary of tho Interior recommends tho passage of an act providing that no pension shall be granted to the widow of any soldier who shall hero after marry. This Is on tho prlnciplo that a woman who marries a soldier 32 years since peaco was declared takes him for bet ter or worse, and not having experienced any of tho hardships, deprivations and anxieties Incident to the llfo of tho wife of a soldier should not be put on tho rolls as such. Under existing law a woman who marries a soldier pensioned under tho act of 1890 Ir not entitled to a pension un less she was married to him prior to the passage of tho act, but there Is no limita tion respecting the wife of a soldier pen sioned under the general act.

While the flcures for the fiscal vear nf 1897 are not vet available. It Is llkelv that the amount of foreign black plate used In tin plate manufacture in this country dur ing that period was something less than three quarters of one per cent of the en tire consumption. It is stated upon com petent authority that there is everv nrnh. ability that in the fiscal year just begin ning the United States will rank as a tin exporting country. in me tiscal vear of 1897 the hlarfc nl.ii mills whose product forms the basis of the tin manufacture, Increased in number from 170 to 198, and already in the present fiscal year these mills havn lnrr,p,l tn 200, with many more projected. Tho largest tin manufacturing plant In the world has been erected recently at New Castle, In Pennsylvania. Tin plate man ufacturing in the United States now flvpn direct employment to nearly 20,000 men. l lie cold statement of these fact, in-atl. fylng as they arc, does not show the en tire benefit which has accrued from the en couragement and Impetus which the Mc- .iuiey iann imparted to me American tin plate Industry. Durimr all this nprinH nf the starting and fostering of the Industry here, the price of tin plate to the con sumer has steadily decreased. Before the passage of the McKinley tariff a box of English tin plate cost $4.25. For two or three months after the bill became a law the price of the duty-paid English product in our market was s-4.80. the American manufacturer, however, underselling it at $4.70. But In a short time the natural play of competition began and the same amount of tin plate as was selling for $4.25 previously to 1892 is now selling at $3.15. Congress. The bill providing for the prohibition of pelagic scaling by Americans was pre sented in the Senate Wednesday by the foreign relations committee. It was ex plained that the bill was in aid of negotia tions now pending among the representa tives of the government, of the United States, Great Britian, Russia and Japan. Mr. Pettigrew antagonized the measure and offered an amendment providing for the killing of all seals on the Pribyloff islands if by the 1st of June next Great Britain also had not agreed to a prohibition of pelagic sealing. The amendment was defeated and the bill passed by a vote of S7 to 14. Mr. McBridn endeavored to secure tlm adoption of his resolution directing the secretary of war to supply relief to the suf fering miners in the Klondike region, and appropriating $250,000 for that purpose, but tho resolution was recommitted. The session closed with a civil servlcn debate upon the bill presented by the cen sus committee providing for the appoint ment of a director of the census and 32 em ployes, who should form the skeleton of an office force for the 12th census. Mr. Lodge of Massachusetts made an extended speech advocating the application of the civil service law to the census office em ployes and savins that statistics would prove that the work could be done at a saving of time, money and efficiency if tho employes were taken from the civil service certified list. Tho legislative executive and ludiclal appropriation bill was considered In the House. Au amendment was adopted re ducing the clerical force in the pension of- uce uj, involving a reduction in saUries of $115,000. Tho civil service question was discussed at some length. Nruatoi- .Hoirlll on Hawaiian Annexa tion. From the Burlington Free Press.) It has been known and nuhliclv As claimed that Senator Morrill of Vermont was opposed to annexation of Hawaii, we think we violate no confidence by copying the following brief indication of his no. sltion, as expressed In a private letter re cently written by the Senator to a Vermont constituent. He says: "I have told our friends that if Wash. Ington or Oregon would accept of Hawaii as a county, I would favor It (annexation) but never as a territory, as It would bo brought Into the Union as a state upon the first exigency, and it would be a farce to give the natives or any others there state powers and equal representation in the Union with Now York, Pennsylvania, 1 1 1 I ....
