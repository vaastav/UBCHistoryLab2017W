Gibbons, who told me he could cure her crse Inside of two months. I placed her nndcr his treatment and she began to Improve at once, and with six months treatment she is souud and well. I cheerfully make this statement not only- Injustice to l)r. Gibbons, but ton nee my friends wh are suffering with Catarrh to go to him aud be cured. J. F. Comoaf , Iola, Kansas, Oct. 20, 18SI I had for more than ten years suffered with a dreadful case of Nasal Catarrh. In that time I had never been entirely free from heaviness and pains in the head, frequently Intense pains, and often lasting all day. My eyes had become so weak that they not only pained eeerry from using them at work or reading, but often troubled mo seriously when atrest, andeieu duriug the night gaveme no rest; had profuse discharge of matter from the head falling In the throat, especially mornings, when blowing out the plugs was so troublesome as to make me sick and leave a miserable taste In ray mouth; had frequent roaring in the cars, sense of smell was al most destroyed with general weakness and debiilt of the whole system. The disease had tikcu such a hold on me that life was almost intolerable. 1 had been treated by two prominent ph si clans and had uBed almost everything generally ncnmiiiHled fur the disease but with no ier ceptlble relief. 1 was recommended to consult Dr. Gibbons and did so, though without any confidence. I, howeer, commenced his treatment, and so soon found relirf that I continued. I was in a few days relieved of that terrible headache, and then one after another symptom dis appeared nn til In four weeks treatment I am not only entirely well but such a change makes me feel better than I cter did before 1 had the disease, rwlll gladly ghe any further particulars of my case to any ouo afflicted with Catarrh who will call on me. La'liia A. Ciiadrick. Iola, Kansas, Oct. 26, 18S3. My little girl, tenyears of age, has for some time had Xnsal Catarrh, her worse sjmptoms were as follows : Severe headache two or three tlmi a dav; naitiful soreness of the eves, the whole of the white (or sclerotic) of the right eye was inflamed ami as red as blood, andone-half the left e the same. She waa puny, sickly, bad no appetite could not sleep, anil was so week She could not play with other children. She had beeu treated by physicians who admitted she had Catarrh, but claimed that hrr sore eyes were cau-ed In scrofula. 1 waa alarmed at her con dition which was growing rapidly wono. Dr Gib'Kius decided that the sore eyes as well ns the other symptoms, resulted from Catarrh, and suld ViU. be could cure her. I plncrd her un der his care, aud in two weeks every other symptom is removi-d and she is as rosy, cheerful, sound and well as any child, all without a drop of Internal medicine and nothing beyond the Doctor's Medicated Spray. Ills treatment Is slmp'y aetouishing and certainly eiires'Latarrb aud all Its dreadful symptoms, and does It speedily. lijusAUKE K. Oiiiick. Iola, Kansas. Oct. 2C. isst.

Special Correspondence of the RxoiftTxu. Washington, D. C, Dec. 10, 1883. The probable composition of the va rious committees and the turn likely to be given to legislation by the Dem ocratic House constitute the chief sub jects of speculation and discussion here just now. Whether we shall have a tariff issue in the campaign next year depends somewhat upon circnnistan ces, but it is certain that the Demo crats will avoid it if they can. As to the shaping of legislation on that sub ject, much depends on the make-up of the Wuj's aud Means committee. It has generally been conceded that Wm. R. Morrison, of Illinois, would be the chairman of that committee, because he is pre-eminently the leader of the tariff-reform section of the party and because he held that position under Mr. Kerr's administration as Speaker of the Forty-fourth Congress. But there Is some talk that it would be good policy to give this committee to Mr. Hewitt, of New York, an iron manufacturer and a man of large busi ness interests and experience. It is not improbable that the consideration of policy will prevail If Mr. Morrison is satisfied to take some other position. While the Democratic House is en gaged in scramblo and division by lot of the spoils of office, the Republican Senate has postponed all action look ing to a change of employees. It is understood that Judge Edmunds de sires to resign the Presidency of that body and that Senator Anthony is likely in that case to succeed him, pro vided he is sufficiently restored to health. With the present Congress Mr. Anthony enters upon his fifth term as Senator, and if he survives to the end it will make a period of thirty years continuous service. But one similar case exists in the history of the Senate that of Thomas Benton. Mr. Anthony Is now very appropriately called the Father of the Senate, while Judge Kelley occupies that responsi ble relation to the House. Senator Edmunds has promptly brought forward bis supplementary measures for the suppression of polyga my in the Territories. One great diffi culty heretofore encountered in prose cutions for polygamy In Utah has been the lack of authenticated evidence of marriage aud the Impossibility of get ting the testimony of wives against their husbands. The new bill pro vides under adequate penalties, thut full certificates shall be filed and re corded in a court with the probate powers of every marriage that takes place in any Territory, and makes both husband and wife both competent witnesses, who may be compelled to testify In any case where a violation of the lawd relating to bigamy, polygamy, or unlawful co habitation is charged. Another diffi culty in dealing with the peculiar in stitution of Utah has been the right accorded to womeu to vote at all elec tions in the Territory. Mr. Edmunds' bill takes away that right. It goes further, and abolishes all elective offices In the Territory, and provides for the exercise of their functions by a commission until such time as the Legislative Assembly shall make new provisions conformed to the require ments of Congress. This last feature of the bill is the most likely to excite opposition. The report of Public Printer Rounds appears in pamphlet form, gotten up in the best style of the art preserva tive. Rounds takes some new departures in the way of recommenda tions, not the least important of which is contained in the suggestion that the expense of publishing the Congression al Record would be materially de creased if the practice of printing speeches which were never delivered before Congress could be abolished. The practice has grown to such en ormous proportions In the last four years that the Uncord has come to take rank with that endless list of publio documents that ore printed only to be thrown aside as waste paper. If it is the heighth of a Member's ambi tion to see his speeches in print, he should shoulder the expense of print ing them himself, and not take this clandestine way of plundering the Treasury, to say nothing of the impo sition practiced upon the publie. Mr. Rounds succeeds in establishing the fact that his administration of the Government printing establishment has been admirable; that it employs more than two thousand hands : that it is the largest concern of its kind in the world, and that the expense of running it during the paat year was over two millions of dollars. It is close on to forty yean since the Mexican war, and although the Mexi cans are said to have fired copper bul lets the better to insure the killing of the hated Yankees, there are no less than twelve thousand of the veterans yet among us, as lively as crickets and ready, apparently, Tor another brush with the Greasars, The Vets met here on the seventh, for the purpose of swapping lies and layingont some sort of a programme to get themselves re membered by Congressional enact ment. In other words, they want a pension with back pay adjustment, and they ought to have it if they did any fighting. Among those who are still prominent living characters, and who did valiant services at Cherubus co, Buena Vista, and other sanguinary fields, are Mr. Jeff Davis, P. G. T. Beauregard, Mr. Ulysses S. Grant, Gen. Totten, Gen. Drum, and perhaps less than a score of others. Junius. Gov. Click congratulates Speaker Carlisle Jon achieving a victory over "corporations." Coming from one who has made his living as a corporation lawyer, such a dispatch as that shows considerable "gall." The Fort Scott Monitor came out last week in a bran-new dress which gives it a very attractive and metropolitan air. The Monitor is one of the bright est and ablest papers in the State, and we are glad the people V Fort Scott appreciate it enough to give it a hand some support. Ox the vexed question of the disposi tion of the surplus revenues, the Presi dent in his message makes nn excellent suggestion. He thinks that a portion, at least, might be profitably spent in restoring our Navy to a status in some degree proportioned to our require ments, and in providing coast defenses for the protection of our harbors. The Atchison Champion remembers that Henry Stanley, the African ex plorer, is a formerly-of-Kansas man, "having stayed for some time in Junc tion City, reporting an Indian war in progress nuuureus or miles iariner west, where iie gained the reputation as a pleasant gentleman, and a liar ful ly ablo to compete with the western Kansas article." It seems pretty conclusively settled that Col. John Hay Is the author of The Bread Winners," the anonymous story In the Cenluri which has attract ed so much attention. He has lived In Cleveland for years and knows the town and people. His fortunes and tales are those of his hero, "Col. Far nan)," and he has a brother in the reg ular army where "Col. Farnam" is represented as having served. The most vigorous suggestions with regard to Mormonism that have ever appeared in a president's message, came from Mr. Arthur. He proposes as aggressive a policy as the most rad ical anti-mormons could desire. He favors the repeal of the act upon which the existing government of Utah de pends, and the assumption by Con gress of tho entire political control of the Territory. We hope Congress will be as thoroughly ln'earnest about the matter as the President seems to be. Blaise's letter, suggesting that the revenue derived from the tax on whis key be distributed among the several states, is attracting so much attention that it is barely possible that a bill embodying his views may be brought before this session of congress. The scheme is criticised very severely on various ground, but as between that and the total abolition of the tax, as proposed in a bill already Introduced by Congressman Blair, there seems lit tle choice. Mr. Blaine very sensibly argues that whiskey ought to be taxed rather than homesteads and workshops aud that it would be an act of folly to omit collecting the $86,000,000 now re ceived by the government from that source. On the basis of $88,000,000 a year Kansas would receiveSl ,743,000, a sum which would reduce our taxes very materially. KB. 

HASKELL'S ILLNESS. Occasionally, since the meeting of Congress, the papers have referred to Mr. Haskell's illness, but so far as we have observed nothing very definite has appeared. From a private letter of Ed. R. Smith Edq., Mr. Haskell's private secretary, to a gentleman in this city, we learn thtt while not pro nounced absolutely dangerous his at tack nevertheless is somewhat serious and likely to prevent his taking any active part in me proceedings or uon-Lo; gress for Borne time. si Mr. Haskell has not enjoyed his usual health since the adjournment of Congress last summer, having been several times confined to the house, all of which, together with his present attack, are undoubtedly due to his con stant and exhausting labors during the last session of Congress. He took a prominent and leading part in the most important legislation of that ses sion, especially that connected with the revision of the tariff, baviug mas tered that most abstruse and difficult subject in a maimer that astonished members who had spent a lifetime in its study, and must have required in tense and long continued application. This and other public duties, together with his prompt attention to the thou sand and one personal demands of his constituents, have proved too much for even his robust constitution, and he is now suffering the penalty. It Is sincerely to be hoped, however, that the present session will prove less la borious, and that our distinguished member will soon regain .his seus-l tomed health and vigor.. MEN OF

LA&OE deputation of jcougreaimen headed by S. 8. .Cog;, waited on Aha President last Saturday and petl tone him to use his position and influence to have the execution of O'Donneli the murderer of the Irish informer Cary, postponed until the ease could be fur ther investigated. It will be remem bered that O'Donneli has been tried and convicted in England, and next Monday fixed upon as the date for his execution. Mr. Cox, speaking for the committee, asserted that his trial was a mockery of justice, and that as .an American citizen, O'Donneli was enti tled to all that this goverument,CGUld do, to procure hitn a fair aud Impartial trial. The President promised to cable Mr. Lowell, at once and take whatev er action in the case ho could with pro priety. While the Democratic party is ac cusing the Repuplicons of waving the bloody shirt one of the latest and most vigorous charges to that effect be ing by the mouth of Carlisle himself it may be pertinent to quote from a speech made by him in 1876, in which he tuv bosotned hlmpelf in the following pa triotic Btyle, the report being given verbatim, by. the Cincinnati Qaxttfa the next day : " I deny that the United States is. a nation.
