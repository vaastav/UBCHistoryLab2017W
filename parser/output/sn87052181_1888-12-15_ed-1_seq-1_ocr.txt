Attornev-General Garland, in U: annual retiort. make- an . earnest jppeal to Congress to provide for the construction of Government peniten tiaries and reformatories. Recent laws that have been enacted by States with re spect to the labor of prisoners prove more t 'inclusively than ever, he say-, the abso lute need of such institutions. Provisions should at once be made looking to the erection of at least one United States penitentiary, and. if possible, a reform atory. The objection iu the minds of many that the co-t of ciud.ictiug snch an institution would be so much greater than the exi-ting arrangement is being almost overcome by the fact that '.he favorable contracts which the depart ment has heretofore been able to enterin- ... l.s - l... ..... l.

This necessitates a resort 1 i to experiments in other systems, as pro visou must neces.-arilv tie made for mo working of convict-, if discipline is to bo , maintained and the prisoner's health and I comfort considered. A large number of , prisoners convicted in United States j courts are those who have committed but j a single offense, and who have but com- I menced a career of crime. If they could li.. m-.n enf.til Onm .eirit i III' with hard ened criminals and not confined in an iu- ' stitution which in every way suggests -j, criminal life, manv, perhaps, eould be re- ' tonne who spoil tin n, the 1: class referred to above, should not ; bo confined ill a prison, but the Government should provide a suitable reformatory where proper influences could be thrown -around them and their reformation effected, as is done now in several States. In addition to all this, he says, it would seem that tho United States should have model prisons and reformatories of its own iu which to confine its criminals, and pinvi-ions could be made tor the employment ot tho inmates at some suitable industries on a system of labor which would not violate the recent act of Congress, nor be incon sistent with the law- passed by the sever al States and the prevailing opinions rela tive to the subject of contract labor.
