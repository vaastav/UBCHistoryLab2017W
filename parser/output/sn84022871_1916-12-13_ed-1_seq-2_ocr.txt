"Billy" Sunday seems to be an is sue in New England just now, and the Monitor will risk being chided by the Rutland Herald for writing be fore having heard him. But much of the comment read seems to be written with such ignorance of matters with which Sunday is compared that the Monitor cannot refrain from saying a word. A Vermont contemporary says: "We frankly admitwe are not in sym pathy with Billy Sunday's cuss-word religion." The same paper says: "It wasn't necessary for Jesus Christ to use slang and profanity to make his reproof of evil effective." And in closing the editor writes, "There is very little of 'Mother's Bible' taught in Sunday's tabernacle meetings." The Monitor advises the writer of the above to get out his Bible or that of his mother, and turn to the 23d chapter of Matthew, and read a bit of one of Jesus' speeches or sermons. At the very opening of the chapter we read, "Then spake Jesus unto the multitudes saying, 'The scribes and pharise?ssitin Moses' seat, but they say and do no t.' " A lot of people who criticize and judge Sun day for his method are in the class named above. They are just as lib eral in their judgment of the average church and preacher as they are in their judgment of Sunday, setting themselves up as judges, but not do ing themselves. As for Sunday's slang and profani ty, if one pleases to call it that, or as to his 'vituperations, Sunday's worst does not compare unfavorably with the chapter mentioned above, of less than 40 verses. In it Jesus addresses Hb audience at least seven times as "hypocrites." As Christ warms to His subject, we find Him speaking to His audience as "fools" and "blind." In the 24th verse we quote Him as say ing, "Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel." In the 33d verse Christ comes to the climax when he says, "Ye serpents, ye gen eration of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell?" As for homely, startling language and illustrations does "Billy" Sunday use that vhich is more common or more inelegant than those quoted above about the gnat and camel, or the following found in this same chapter, " ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess." Or his refer ence to the whited sepulchres "which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones In "Billy" Sunday's own language but with all reverence the Monitor cannot see where he "has anything on" the Master, himself. That the licensed saloon and the whole liquor business is in a death struggle is becoming more and more evident. One of the most telling bits of news that has come to the notice of the Monitor is the following. A search through the building re ports of the American Contractors on file in the Crerar library, Chicago, showed investments in extensions of breweries, new distilleries, new bot tling plants, new capitalization, and plans for new buildings in the United States amounted to 1905 . $14,449,078 1907 10,181,262 1908 - 2,082,000 1915 . 429,500 Compare the above table with the following showing the prosperity of legitimate business.

Willoughby lake is to have a re modeled hotel. Willoughby lake is large enough and attractive enough to have several hotels and to have them occupied during the summer, providing judicious 'publicity is used. One drawback of the place has been the inability to care for those who admire splendid scenery. Heretofore Willoughby lake has been the middle point of a round-trip excursion for a single day; whereas it might be the stopping-place of hundreds of people every season and for long periods. Barre Times. Page's Bill Gets Boost from Presi dent. In his brief message to congress President Wilson took occasion to plead for the support by the house of a bill which has already passed the senate. He said : "Promotion of vo cational and industrial education, which is of vital imnortance to the whole country because it concerns a matter, too long neglected, upon which the thorough industrial prep aration of the country for the criti cal years of economic development immediately ahead of us in very large measure demands." The president's endorsement of the vocational education bill will undoubtedly bx-ing joy to Senator Page of Ver mont, author and sponsor of the bill in the senate. Brattleboro Reformer. Harry Black for Clerk. Harry A. Black of Newport will be a candidate again for clerk of the house of representatives, a position he has filled since 1912. Mr. Black, who is a lawyer by profession, is 37 years of age. He was second assistant clerk in IQG'3 and first assistant clerk in 1008 and 1910. He has given unusual ly efficient service in the past. The smooth working of business in the house has in a large measure been due to a thorough knowledge of the work on his part and the assistants he named to toil with him. Without an experienced clerk in charge the legislature would be rudderless dur ing the organization period and for a considerable portion of the session until the new man was broken in. Out side of being a capable official, Mr. Black has a way of making members feel at home when transacting busi ness at hie desk or in his of?ce and they go to x him for advice on how to do things as much as they go to the speaker. All such inquirers have been impresed by the uniform courtesy with which they are treated. Mont rciier Argus. Cour-ty Agricultural Agents. Although almost unnoticed among the urban population the county agents of Vermont are carrying for ward a great constructive movement and one designed to bring Vermont agriculture to a realization of its big opportunities. At their convention recently ad journed in Burlington, these men, in a set of resolutions, put in the records a statement of what they are trying to accomplish for the Vermont farm er. TIi9y,4are prepared to furnish in formation on the best methods of forming dairy improvement associa tions, on the various economies that enn easily be made, on the health and care of the animals, and on stan dards of weight, feed, etc. They are prepared to furnish the principles of a basis on which cooper ative associations for the transporta tion and marketing of farm products may be profitably formed by farmers, and to go into all other details of what the experts have ascertained to be the fundamentals of successful farm operation and management. The movement and the work cannot be belittled. It represents ideas of progress which, if adopted, will re store Vermont to "a place in the sun" agriculturally. Burlington News. 'Brighten the Corner Where You Are." It is not necessary in doing this to turn a back handspring nor to get heart disease in making the effort to bring sinners to repentance. When one hits the sawdust trail there are other ways. And perhaps just as ef fective. It may be a case of results. Perhaps more oneway than the other. But you can make your individual corner considerably brighter by being a good, upright citizen. By not havings a continual grouch. By seeing that some church has an annual stipend from your income. Take your choice on this. . By seeing that some poor family has your pleasant greeting. By taking' an interest in all good works even if you do not agree with many of them. By seeing that . the cracks in the barn are stopped, so that your stock will have. a comfortable place. By blanketing the horse when standing. This does not mean to throw the blanket at him, but tuck it in good. By greeting your business associ ates cordially each morning. By supporting your home mer chants, and giving them a chance at your business. By keeping your sidewalks clean in winter. Visitors will notice this the rst thing. By brightening up your store win dows, keeping the front of your busi ness blocks painted fresh and gener ally keeping up the good appearance of your property. By looking on the bright side of life.

Mr. Editor: I enclose check to pay for Monitor to January, 1918, which will make 47 years I will have taken it when the time is up. I have the first copy somewhere and the last copy of the Standard printed at Barton. I think you have very few that have taken it from the first, so few that you ought to give it to them for the rest of their lives after they pay 50 years. Yours very truly, C. W. Preston.

Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cured by local applications,' as they cannot reach the diseased portion of the ear. There is only one way to cure catarrhal deafness, and that is by a constitutional remedy. Catarrhal Deafness is caused by an in flamed condition of the mucous lining of the Eustachian Tube. When this tube is inflamed you have a rumbling sound or im perfect hearing, and when it is entirely closed, Deafness is the result. Unless the inflammation can be reduced and this tube restored to its normai condition, hearing will be destroyed forever. Many cases of deafness are caused by catarrh, which is an inflamed condition of the mucous sur faces. Hall's Catarrh Medicine acts thru the blood on the mucous surfaces of the system. We will give One Hundred Dollars for any case of Catarrhal Deafness that cannot be cured by Hall's Catarrh Medicine. Cir culars free. All Drugrgiats, 75c F. J. CHENEiir & CO., Toledo. O.

TEST ASSOCIATION SITUA TION. (The material in this column is ag ricultural matter, but owing to lack of room on that page is pub lished in this column.) During the fall the county agent has made an attempt to organize and re-organize the cow testing associa tions of the county. He was success ful in organizing a new association in the towns of Brighton and Charles ton. The work of two other associa tions has not been completed. The difficult proposition in the situation is to secure a man to do the. work. There seems to be no one available since the county agent has been in correspondence with practically all the agricultural schools in New Eng land. It is very unfortunate that this condition of affairs has developed be cause the cow test work is one of the most important features of the de velopment of agriculture in Orleans county. There is evidently something wrong vith the work of the associa tions and it is evident" that these as sociations do not pay criOup;b. sa!?.r to attract desirable candidates. If these associations are to continue to do their work they must increase the pay to their tester in proportion to what the price of labor has advanced It will probably be necessary before the associations are on a successful basis to advance the price per cow to $1.50. This would undoubtedly en able the association to pay attractive salaries to desirable men. The coun ty agent is hopeful of securing men in the near future for this work, but nothing definite can be promised at this time. COUNTY AGENT'S VISITS. The following is a schedule of of fice hours to be held in the different localities. The county agent is planning a se ries of days when he will be in the different communities for consulta tion with the farmers in regard to their fertilizer and other farm prob Isms. We arc giving a schedule be low of the first two weeks. In the other communities similar office hours will be held after the holidays, but the schedule could not be completed so far in advance. Those who are planning to buy chemicals should see that their orders are in, at an early date since the congestion of the rail roads may delay transportation, and it is well to have plenty of time for .rrive.

Barnet 9-21 Powers Brothers WHAT BARTON WANTS TO KNOW The Answer Is Found in the State ment of a Barton Resident. From week to week, from year to year, there have been appearing in these columns statements - made by neighbors, which we have all read with great interest, and many of us with great profit. But what we want to know is, do they stand the greatest test of all the test of time? Here is conclusive evidence on this point from a Barton man: H. A. Folsom, prop, butcher shop, Glover street, Barton, gave the fol lowing statement on June 5, 1911. He said: "I am subject to lame and aching back and my kidneys do not act as they should at times. Doan's Kidney Pills have given me good re lief and I do not hesitate to recom mend them." NO 

TROUBLE SINCE. On October 9, 1916, Mr. Folsom said: "Doan's Kidney Pills cured me of kidney trouble and backache and I have had no return of my former trouble. I am glad to again endorse this reliable medicine." Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't simply ask for a kidney remedy get Doan's Kidney Pills the same that Mr. Folsom has twice publicly recom mended".
