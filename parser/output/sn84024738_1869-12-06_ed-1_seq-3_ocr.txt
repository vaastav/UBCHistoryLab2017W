That committee, after spend-; ?jjj> JlhOlit two years in thorough exaraina ? r. of witnesses (employes in the Treasury pepartment) and personal inspection of machinery, hooks, etc., has made a report. The committee was composed of two sen ator- .Edmunds, chairman.) and one mem :er of the House, who appear to have Tom harmonious and in perfect accord in their report. It will he recollected that the charge? were, in substance, that the affairs of the vrintinsr and note department were carried ,\n in a criminally reckless manner, result ing in enormous losses to the people, and :h.,t it? conduct was so loose and free from proper checks to prevent rascality as to call : the intervention of Congress,'inasmuch .. repeated unsuccessful efforts had been nr.de i > induce the then Secretary of the T-t c.snry to take notice of the facts, and ar n -t the waste and step the peril. v !; c report of the con'mittce, covering1 ;?:!

It is impossible, therefore, to account except on very vague evidence for many of the securities that went into the Register's office. The foregoing are specimens of the many paragraphs in this voluminous report, show ing the so-called irregularities practiced in the Treasury Department up to last March. l'p >n careful examination of the report the r.

The Pan-tin- Murder?Confession.?The reader will recollect the intense sensation caused by the accounts of the horrible mur 1?% Klnck family, in the neighbor hood of Pantin, near Paris, France, about two months ago. One Traupman was arrest ed as the murderer. He admitted the deed, but represented Jean Kinck, the father, as the principal, himself as an accessorv to the crime. Jean Kinck or his body could not r despite the most vigorous searches. ral}c? llie public interest was aroused "> the highest pitch, but all inquiries were unsuccessful. Spiritual mediums were em ployed, but could elicit no information. Our news was only fragmentarv, and the interest ma tragedy without development subsided. The denouement is now before us. I he Opinion Rationale informs its readers tliat Traupman has made a full con fession. Traupman is alone guilty. "We give his condensed account of the facts: After murdering John Kinck, on August -o, in a plain near .Guebweiler, and burr ing the body in a place minutelv described ?i- P.ns0"er> Traupman thought of ridding himself of the oldest son, Gustave, who had been to Guebweiler to claim from the post-office an order for 5,000 francs, sent there bv Mrs. Kinck for her husband. Gus tave Kinck returned to Paris, was induced to go to Pantin, and was assassinated two days before his mother, a few yards from the ditch which was to be the grave of the ?whole family. On September 20th, after completing his preparations, Traupman took the Kinck fiacre to Pantin. On reaching me Chennn "V ert (Green lane) he made Mrs. Kinck and the two youngest children get out. Alter passing the last houses on this narrow, crooked, and dark street, tlicv ( came into the plain. The ditch had been dug in a hollow deep enough to prevent what was going on in it from being seen from the Aubervillers road. The fiacre , stopped at the corner of the Chemin Vert, I uid the driver could have no intimation of what happened at a short distance from ; turn. Traupman seized first the little girl ripped her open with a knife, and flung her (stillalive) from a distance into the ditch. I hen he rushed upon the mother: a short, terrible struggle ensued, the youngest boy holding on to his mother's dress and' uttering piercing cries: but soon the cries were sueuced. The murderer, to complete his work, went for the eldest and the two younger children, who had been left in the nacre, and suspected nothing. Traupman sent the two young ones ahead, who walked with hands clasped towards the ditch, the older one following a few paces behind them. 1 bis was the strongest one of the three, traupman commenced with him, throwing a noose around his neck and strangling him, cut the throats of the two other;, and fin ished the old one, who showed signs of life, with a knife. The rest is known. In some opening remarks of a course on geology, which I am now delivering in the University, I said that the ''theological in terpretation of the Book of Genesis giviu" sex thousand years as the age of the world was a hindrance to the understanding of geological evidence, and no one who started with this idea, and allowed his researches to he influenced by it, could be a geologist."

Judge Iloadlcy, of Cincinnati. Effect of Railroads on the Weather.? The opinion seems to be gaining strength that the Pacific railroad is working a great change in the cb'mute*)f the plains. Instead of continuous droughts, all alon? the rail road rain now falls in refreshing abundance. This result has been remarked upon in other sections of the West. In central Ohio, lor example, it is said the climate has been com pletely revolutionized since iron rails have formed a net work all over that region. Iu stead of the destructive droughts" formerly suffered there, for some four or five years there has been rain in abundance?even more than enough to satisfy all the wants of farmers. This change is thought to be the j result of an equilibrium produced in the j electrical currents, which has brought about | a more unilorm dispensation of the rain. It is a fact within the observation of all who re member ante-railroad times that we have now few or.no such thunder-storms as we formerly had in New England. The iron rails which touch and cross each other in every direction serve as conductors and equalizers of the electric currents, and so prevent the terrible explosions which used to terrify us in former years. The telegraphic wires which accompany the iron rails everywhere also act an important part in diffusing electricity equally through the at mosphere, thus preventing the occurrence of severe thunder-storms.?Boston Traveller, November 30.
