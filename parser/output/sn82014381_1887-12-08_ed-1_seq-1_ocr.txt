HE SCATTERS CLEVELAND'S FREE TRVDE SOPHISTRIES To the Winds— A Remarkable Elucidation of the American Policy of Protection. [SP» I.U. NBPAICSSSTOTm KECORD-l'SloN.] New York, December Bth— A. m.— The Tribune this morning contains a long inter view with Hon. James (j. Maine on Presi dent Cleveland's message. He says: "I have been reading an abstract of the Presi j dent's message, and have been especially ! interested in the comments of the London papers. Those papers all assume to declare the message as a free trade manifesto, and evidently are anticipating an enlarged market for English fabrics in the United States as a consequence of the President's recommendations. Perhaps that fact stamped the character of the message more clearly than any words can." " You don't mean actual free trade, with out a duty V queried the reporter. "Xo.'' replied Biaine, "nor do the Lon don papers mean that. They simply mean that the President nas recommended what in the United Slates is known as a revenue tarin". rejecting the protective feature as an object, and not even permitting protection to result freely as an incident to revenue duties." "I don't know that I quite comprehend that last point," said the reporter. 

OPPOSED TO INTERNAL REVENIKS. '•I mean," said Biaine, ''that for the first time in the history of the United States a President recommends retaining an in ternal tax in order that the tariff may be forced down even helow a fair revenue standard. lie recommends that the tax on tobacco be retained, and thus many millions annually he levied on domestic products which would far better come from a tariff' on foreign fabrics." "Then, do you mean to imply that you would favor the repeal of the tobacco tax ?" "Certainly, I mean just that," said Mr. Biaine. '* I should urge that it be done at once, even before the Christmas holidays. It would, in the first-place, bring great re lief to the growers of tobacco all over the country, and would, moreover, materially lessen the price of the article to consumers. Tobacco, to millions of men, is a necessity. The President calls it a luxury. It is we'll to remember that the luxury of yesterday becomes a necessity of to-day. Watch, if you please, the number of men at work on a farm, in the coal mines, along the rail roads, in the iron foundries, or in any calling, and you will rind 95 to H ) chew ing tobacco while they work. After each meal the same proportion seek THE 

SOLACE OF THE PIPE OR i:ll!AR. These men not only pay millions of to bacco tax, but pay on every plug and every cigar the enhanced price which the tax enables the manufacturer and retailer to impose. The only excuse for such tax is the actual necessity under which the Gov ernment found itself during the war and the years following immediately afle-. To retain the tax now in order to dcvroy that protection which would incidentally How from raising the same amount of money on foreign imports, is certainly A MOST KXTRAORDIKARY POLICY For our Covernment." " Well, Mr. Blame, would you advise tl c repeal of the whisky tax, also?" ''No, I would not. Other cousideratoi 3 than those of financial administration are to be taken into account with regard lo whisky. There is a nwal side. To cheapen the price of whisky is to increase the consumption enormously. There would be no sense in urging the reform wrought by high license in many States. if the National Government neutralzes the good effect by making whisky within the reach of everyone. At twenty cents a gallon whisky would be everywhere distilled if the surveillance of the Govern ment were withdrawn by the remission of the tax, and illicit sales* could not then be prevented, even by a policy as vigorous and searching as that by which Russia pursues the Nihilists. It would destroy high license at once in all States. Whisky has done a vast deal (it harm in the United States, and I would try to make it do some good. I would DSI THE TAX TO FORTIFY OIR CITIES On the seaboard. In view of the powerful letter addressed to the Democratic party on the subject of fortitications by Samuel J. Tilden in 1885, I am amazed that no atten tion has been paid to the subject by the Democratic Administration. Never before has any Government allowed its great cities on the seaboard to remain defenseless." "' Uut," said the reporter, " you don't think we are to have war in any direc tion ?'' " Certainly not, but we r hould change a remote chance into an absolute impossi bility." " Bat would not our fortifying now pos sibly look as if we expected war?" " Why should it, any more than the for tifications made by our grandfathers, when they guarded tbemselvei against successful attacks from tbe armaments of that day .' We don't necessarily expect a burglar be cause we lock our doors at night." " But after the fortifications are con structed, would you still maintain the tax on whisky . A USE FOR WHISKY TAX. " Yes ; so long as there is whisky to tax I would tax it, and then if the National Government should have no use for the money, I would divide the tax money among the States of the Federal Union, with the specific object of lightening the tax on real estate. It, ultimately, relief could be given in that direction, it would, in my judgment, be a wise and beneficial policy. Some honest but misguided friends of tem perance have urged that the Government should not use money derived from the tax on whisky. My reply is that the tax on whisky by the' Federal Government means the consequent enhancement of the price, which has been a powerful agent in temperance reform, by putting it beyond tbe reach of so many. The amount of whisky consumed in the United States is not more than 40 per cent, of that con sumed thirty years ago. In my judgment the whisky tax should be so modified as to permit those who use pure alcohol in the arts, or in mechanical pursuits, to have it free in all such cases. The tax could be omitted, without danger of fraud, just as now the tax on spirits exported is re mitted.'' "Have you any further specific objec tions?" " 1 es," answered Mr. Blame," I should seriously object to the repeal of tbe duty on wool. To repeal that would work a great injustice to many interests, and would seri ously discourage what we should earnestly encourage— namely, sheep-culture among the farmers throughout the Union. TO HBEAK DOWN WOOL-GROWINe;, And be dependent on foreign countries tor the blankets under which we sleep and the coats that cover our backs is not a wise policy for the National Government to er force." Do you think that if the President's recommendations were adopted they would increase our export trade." " Possibly on some few articles of peculiar construction it might, but it would in crease our import trade tenfold as much in great staple fabrics— in woolen and cotton m iron, steel, in all the thousands and one shapes in which they are wrought. How are we to export staple fabrics to the market of Lurope, unless we make them cheaper than they do in Europe" And how are we to manufacture them cheaper unless we get cheaper labcr than they have? ' * "Do you think THE 

QUESTION OF LABOK Underlies the whole subject?" "Of course it does," replied Mr. Blame "It is in fact the entire question. When ever we can force carpenters, masons, iron workers and mechanics in every department to work is cheaply and live as poorly in the United States as similar workingmen m Europe, we can of course manufec ure just as cheaply as they do in. Englar.u aad SACRAMENTO, THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1887. France, but I am totally opposed to a policy that would entail such results. To attempt it is equivalent to a social and financial revolution — one that would bring untold distress." " Yes, but might not THE GREAT FARMIKG CLASS Be benefited by importing articles from Europe, instead of buying them at higher prices at home?" "The moment," answered Mr. Biaine, "you begin to import freely from Europe, you drive our own workmen from me chanical and manufacturing pursuits. In the same proportion they become tillers of the soil, increasing steadily the agricultural product, and decreasing steadily the large home demand, which is constantly enlarg ing as home manufactures enlarge. That, of course, works great injury to the farmer — glutting the market with his products, and tending continually to lower prices." "But the foreign demand for farm pro ducts would be increased in like ratio, would it not?" "Even suppose it were," said Biaine, "how do you know the source from which it will be supplied.' The tendency in Russia tc day, and in the Asiatic posses sions of England is toward a large increase of the grain supply. Grain is being rained by the cheapest possible labor. Manufact uring countries will buy their breadstuff's where they can get them cheapest, and the enlarging of the home market for the American farmer being checked he would search in vain for one of the same value. His foreign sales are already checked by great competition abroad. "There never was a time when the increase of a large home market was so valuable to him. The lest proof is that Ol'R FARMERS ARE PBOBFKBOBS According to their nearness to manufactur ing centers, and a protective tariil tends to spread manufactures. In Ohio and lu diaua, for example, though not classed as manufacturing fc'tates, the annual value of manufactured fabrics is more than the agri cultural products.'" "But those holding the President's views, remarked the reporter, " are always quoting the great prosperity of the country under the tariff of ls-il>." " That tariir did not involve one distinc tive point recommended by the President— namely, the retaining of direct internal taxf s, in order to abolish indirect tuxes lev ied on foreign fabrics. But the country had peculiar advantages under it by the Crimean war involving England, France and Kussia, and largely impairing their trade. And all these incidents(or accidents, if you choose) weie immensely stimulat ing to trade in the United States regardless of the nature of our tariff, but mark the end of this European experience with the tariil of 1816, which for a time gave an illusiory and deceptive thow of prosperity. Its enactment was im mediately followed by the Mexican war. Then, in I*4*, by great convulsions in Europe; then, in ls-l'j, and succeeding years, by the enormous gold yield in Cali fornia. The Powers made peace in 

ISSG, and at the same time the output of gold in California fell off. Immediately the financial panic of 1X57 came on the country with disastrous force. Though we have in these years mined a vast amount of gold in California, every bank in New York was compelled to suspend specie pay ment. " WHERE ol'R i;OLD WENT. "Pour hundred millions in gold had been carried out of the country in eight years to pay for foreign goods that should have been manufactured at home, and we had years of depression and distress as atonement for our folly. "It is remarkable that President Polk recommended the tariff of 184f> on pre cisely the same ground that Cleveland recommends a similar enactment now— namely, that a surplus in the Treasury was menacing the prosperity of the country." 

HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF. " By the way," Blame added, after a mo meut's rellection, ''it is worthy of notice that Polk, on emptying the Treasury by a free trade tariff, immediately rushed into debt by borrowing $100,000,000 for the Mexican war. I trust that nothing may occur to repeat so disastrous a sequel to the policy recommended by Cleveland, but the uniform fate, for fifty years past, of the Democrats party has been that when it goes out of power it always leave an empty Treasury, and when it returns to power it always finds a full Treasury." 'Then, do you mean to imply that there should be no reduction of National rev enurs?" "No. What I have said implies the reverse. I would reduce it by a prompt repeal of the tobacco tax, and would make here and there some changes in the tarill' so as not to reduce protection, but to wisely foster it." " I mean,' said Blame, " that no great system of revenue like our tariff can operate with efficiency and equity, un less the changes of tlie trade be closely watched and the law promptly adapted to those changes. But I would make no changes that should impair (he char acter of the whole body of the tarill' laws. Four years ago, in the Act of 1888, we made a change of the char acter I have tried to indicate. If such changes were made, and the fortifying of our sea coast then undertaken at a very moderate annual outlay, no surplus would be found after that already accumulated had been disposed of. "The outlay of money on fortifications, while doing great service to the country, would give good work to many men." '' But, what about the existing surplus?" " The abstract of the message 1 have seen,'' replied Mr. Blame, " contains no reference to that point. I therefore make no comment, further than to indorse Fred. Grant's remarks — that a 'surplus is always easier to handle than a deficit.' " The reporter repeated the question whether the President's recommendation would not, it adopted, give us advantage of a large increase in exports. "I only repeat," answered Ulaine, "it would vastly enlarge our imports, while the only exports it would seriously increase would be our gold and silver. That would flow out bountifully, just as it did under the tariff of 1840." "But don't you think it important to in crease our export trade?" 'Indoubtedly, but it is vastly more im portant not to lose our own great market for our own people in a vain effort to reach the impossible. It is not our foreign trade that has caused the wonderful growth of the republic; it is the vast domestic trade between thirty-eight States and eight Territories, with their population of perhaps 0:2,000,000 people. The whole amount of our export and import trade together has never, 1 think, reached $1,900,000,000 in any one year. Our interior home trade on 130.001 1 miles of railway; along 15,000 miles of ocean coast ; over five great lakes, and along I*o,ooo miles of navigable rivers, reaches the enormous annual aggregate of more than $40,000,000, and perhaps this year $50,000,000. "It is into this illimitable trade, even now in its infancy, and destined to attain a magnitude not dreamed of twenty years ago, that the Europeans are struggling to enter. IT 13 THE 

HERITAGE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, Of their children and of their children's children. It gives absolutely free trade over a territory nearly as large as Kurope, and the profit is all our own. The genuine free trader appears unable to see or com prehend that this continental trade — nut our exchanges with Europe — is the great source of our prosperity. Cleveland now plainly proposes the policy that will admit Europe to a share of this trade." " But you are in favor of extending our foreign trade, are you not ?" " Certainly I am, in all practical and ad vantageous ways, but not on the principle of free trade, by which we shall be con stantly exchanging a dollar for a dime. Moreover, the foreign trade is often very delusive. Cotton is manufactured in the city of my residence. If a box of cotton goods is sent to the province of New Bruns wick it is foreign trade, shipped sev enteen thousand miles around the cape."

DISPATCHES TO THE RECORD-UNION. 1 Hr IN ARMS. Th« Wool-Growers Vigorously Denounce Cleveland's Free-Trade Message. Washhigtos, December 7th — -Yt to day a session of the Conference of Wool- Growers and Wool-Dealers of the United states the following was unanimously adopted : The Wool-Dealers and Wool-Growers of the (jnited States, representing a capital of over live hundred million dollars and a constituency of a million wool-growers and wool-dealers, assembled in conference, and ■ > avl "f rea<l tLe an »"al message of the President to the Fiftieth Congress, de clare that the sentiments of the menage are a direct attack upon their industry one <- .he most important of the country and in positive violation of the National Dem ocratic platform of 1884, as interpreted by the party leaders and accepted by the rank and file of the party ; that the" argument made by the President for the removal of our protection against foreign competition is one repeatedly made by the enemies of out industrial progress, and ss effectively answered in nearly every school district of our land, and thoroughly disproved by the lo;;ic of fasti and the demonstration 01 experience and history, as to need no an swer from us. We had the right to expect something ditierent from the Chief Executive of a na tion that is the most happy, prosperous and contented ot any of the world, and made so by the policy of protection and the de velopment which he now seeks to destroy. We had a rinht to expect that our Presi dent would favor the wool-growers of the United States, and confess our deep disap pointment that, instead, he favors the in terests of our foreign competitors. We make an appeal from his recom mendations to the seven and three- fourths millions of our fellow-citizens engaged in agriculture; to the millions engaged in manufacturing; to the army of wage earners ; to the tradesmen and merchants, that their judgment and decision will be based upon justic3 and patriotism, and therefore for the maintenance of the Amer ican policy of protection, to which the country is indebted for its unexampled de velopment and prosperity. If the whole amount of revenue derived from wool was abolished, it would reduce the surplus only about £5,000.0( K>, or less than :o cents per capita of the population, which is paid by foreigners, while the old war-taxes that he recommends to be re tained yield over $ll'.»,ou<>,ooo. and is a direct tax per capita of $2 each. The annual revenue derived from the imports of wool, under the taritl' of 1867, was less than $1,700,000. Under the re duced tariff of IS*:: the revenue last year was over $5,000,000. The number of sheep in the country in I*B4 was 60,626,626; in 1887, 44,701i,.!H — a decrease of nearly 6,000,000, and the diminution of the annual wool product of over :;r>,uOO,ooo pounds— thus showing that the reduction of the taritl' by the Act of 1883 has increased the revenue from imported wools and dimin ished the number of sheep in the United States about 1J per cent. The President's policy would bring about the destruction of this industry, and the same policy of reduction (or abolition) of the tariff would end in disaster to all other industrial productive enterprises of the country. 

COMMITTEE FORECASTS. Gos»l|> Concerning i In- Probable Person nel of Congressional Committees. [Copyright, 18S7, by Vie California Associated Press.\ Washington, December 7th. — The work of arranging the standing committees of the Senate progresses more slowly than was expected. It is now doubtful if these committees will be announced before Mon day. Senator Stewart of Nevada is anxious to be placed upon the Judiciary Committee, a position winch he had when he was a former member of the Senate. Stanford, who will be made Chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, would also like to get upon the Commerce Committee, but it docs not seeru likely that either Stewart or Stanford will have their ambitions fully gratified. Dolph of Oregon will retain his place on the Commerce Committee as the repre sentative of the Pacific coast. It i-> under stood that Senator Cameron will be Chair- ' man of Naval Affairs, Senator Hawley of Military Affairs, Senator Sabin of Rail roads. Sawyer of Postoflice and Post Routes, Frye of Commerce, Mitchell of Territories, and Wibon of Pensions. Evarts will retain his present position on the Judiciary Committee. IS THE 

HOUSE There are several Chairmanships as good as settled. Mills will go to the head of Ways pnd Means Committee, Randall the Appropriations, Turner the Elections, Culberson the Judiciary, Bland the Coin age, Weights and Measures, Blanchard the River and Hahor, Hatch the Agriculture, Hurltmrt the Naval Atfairs, Blount the Postoflices, Springer the Territories, Tor ney the Militia, Belmont the Foreign Affairs. It is said that Crisp can have the Chair manship of either the Commerce or the Pacific Railroad Committee. He will probably go at the head of the latter com mittee. In that event Clarey will go at the head of the Commerce. Scott will prob ably get the Chairmanship of the Banking and Currency Committee. Both Holmao and Oats are spoken of for the Chairman ship of the Public Land Committee. To-night there is a report that Congress man Scott may be made Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, but the story is not credited. WANT THE CONVENTION. A Grand Struggle by < ilic- fur the Be publicau National Convention. j Copxprigte, ISS7, by tltc CaU/ontia Associated Press. ] WABHnreTOB, December 7th.— The Re publican National Committee will meet at the Arlington Hotel to-morrow. Of the thirty-eight members of the committee only about one-half have arrived, but the remainder are expected within the next twelve hour?. Omaha, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Chicago and Philadel phia delegations are sounding the praises and merits of their respective cities for the honor of holding the Convention. New York is hardly mentioned. There is no body here urging the claims of the Empire State witli any vim, and if the committee does not select upon a Western city for the Convention it seems likely to go to Phila delphia. The Chicago people seem confident of ob taining both the Republican and Demo cratic Conventions, having had both Con ventions in 1884. Being a centra] point, with low railroad fares, excellent hotel ac commodations, and a tine ball of large seating capacity, they manifest a confidence that is not observed among any other dele gation. The Minneapolis and Cincinnati delegations are doing all in their power to influence the majority of the committee, but rumors that the'lilaine men prefer Chicago, with Philadelphia as second choice, are in the air. The members of the committee, with scarcely an exception, refuse to publicly commit themselves in favor of or against any of the cities named as available for Convention purposes. All they will say is that the West offers greater conveniences for delegates than any city on the Atlantic seaboard. The Chicago men are playing a fine game. They expect to successfully pro claim the merits of the Garden City alter Omaha, Minneapolis, Cincinnati and St. Louis shall have exhausted themselves iD the struggle for the honor. The Sherman men are not so enthusiastic over the selec tion of Cincinnati as might be expected. They fear that if the convention is held in Foraker's town he, rather than Sherman, may receive the votes of the delegation for President. Very flattering ciTers will be made by Minneapolis and 0.-uaha for the Convea- tion. It is possible, of course, that one of these thriving young cities may carry oil the prize. 

CONFERRING CHRISTIANS. The Movement for Uniting All the Vari ous Church Denominations. Washington. December 7th.— The Gen eral Christian Conference.under the auspices and direction of the Evangelical Alliance of the United States, opened this mornin». The grand object of the Conference is to discuss measures upon which all the de nominations may be brought to unite ; to meet certain new and pressing emergencies which have arisen in connection with the great increase of wealth, business, immigration, the changed relations of labor and capital, and the great and growing percentage of our population who are not church inemoers nor attend ants. President Dodge, in his opening address, said the Alliance had thoughtfully studied the social and economic changes in the country, and sought to know whether the existing Christian organizations were suffi cient to meet the growing needs. He re ferred to the organized power of the saloons, and said the Church had lost its hold on the working men. Everywhere among them i 3 unrest and looking for higher good. This means a enwd opportunity aud time for an applied Christianity. I 

LOSE THE GATES. At the afternoon session ex-Justice Strong, of the Unitel States Supreme Court, presided. He said there had nev*r been a time when such rallying and uniting of all that is best in the Christian church was more imperatively needed than now. He introduced Prof. il. Boyson. ot Columbia College, who made a short address upon the subject of immigration. The Constitution of the United States, he said, was framed by men of Anglo- Saxon origin for their own government. The Socialists and Anarchists come to avenge here what they sutlered in Europe. By their disloyal sentiments and hostility to American institutions they disorganize anil weaken the State. He believed that the time had arrived when our former pol icy ot indiscriminate absorption of foreign elements of population would result in a serious crisis. The nation is no longer able to assimilate the alien elements with sulli cient rapidity. More competition with American labor enters in a week through Castle Garden than the prisons turn out in a year. Protection to American labor is a farce so long as this unbarred flood-gate re mains open.
