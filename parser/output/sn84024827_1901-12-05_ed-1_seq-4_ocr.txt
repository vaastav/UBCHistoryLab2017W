YVIckershan Mines Sold An important mining deal was trans acted this week In which, many of tho cltlrens of Bisbee are Interested. The Huacbuca Consolidated 'company has acquired by purchase the famous Wick ersham mines, located In the Huachuca mountains. Tbe purchase pric- paid owners have on offer of $750 a ton for all that they can produce. The ledge is 100 fe-jt wide and shows for 700 feet. Kot far from Big Pine, this county, is a deposit from which the metal can be flaked off like so much tea lead. Leading cattlemen are of the opin ion that prloes will remain high for tbe choice kinds, for which the demand Is bard to satisfy. There will also be a better inquiry for the medium clasa a soon as the western range season Is ended, but tbe greatest Inquiry will be for well finl hed steers, and feeders should aim to make their cattle good enough to fill the bill. On account of the shortage In feed, feeders will likely be inclined to economize Drovers Journal. E. E.
