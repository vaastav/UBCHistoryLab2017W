Dec. 9. -President Elect Taft and President Roosevelt met at the conservation congress here, and both spoke from the same platform urging a liberal policy to save the na tion's natural riches. President Itoose Telt said: The three things which should be done without any further delay are. first, to provide for a comprehensive plan (.if wa terway development; second, to begin at once on work sUready planned that will surely fit into the larger plan: third, to provide amply for forest protection against lire, against reckless cutting, against wan ton or reckless destruction oC ail kinds, and to secure the Appalachian and White mountain national forests without delay. Mr. Taft, who was met with si round f cheering, led by the president, said: A conservation nlan to be effective must be one comparatively large enough to TO 

RENT Five rooms rover the whole country. No one state is financially equal to the carrying out of an adequate conservation policy. It is vitally necessary that we have co-operation on the part of the states. I assure you of my deep sympathy with this movement and of my purpose to car ry on the policy so admirably begun and prosecuted by President Roosevelt. I agree with what the president has said about the issuance of federal bonds for the funding of permanent national Improvements. TO
