Large New Mexico Projects. A Washington special of December 2d says: A delegation of residents ot Carlsbad, New Mexico, which has been here several days urging the sec retary of the interior to apportion funds for New Mexican irrigation pro jects, was assured that two proposed projects would be undertaken. One of these Is known as the Carls bad project, and under it the reclama tion service agrees to purchase all property of the Pecos Valley Irrigation Company, Including its canal system, part of tbe dam destroyed by the flood of October last, and all water rights of the company, for all of which $150,000 will be paid. The government will spend In addition In completing the enterprise about $450,000. Work will be commenced Immedi ately and wll be carried on by the reclamation service. It is Imperative that the system shall be advanced to such a stage that water can be fur nished for 15,000 acres prior to the next irrigation season and to do this will not permit the delay of calling for bids and letting all the work to con tractors. In addition to furnishing water for 15,000 acres now under the Pecos Val ley Irrigation Company's canals, the project when completed will be ex tended to irrigate 40,000 acres addi tional and not previously under irriga tion. The other project approved is what is known as the Leesburg diversion project. It will consist of a diversion dam across the Rio Grande river and will furnish water to irrigate 40,000 acres of land In the Mesllla valley in New Mexico and Texas in the vicin ity of El Paso. The project will cost $200,000 and the apportionment of this sura has been tentatively approved by the secretary of the interior, the amount to be available as soon as the proposed water users sign contracts to repay the cost of the works to Jhe gov ernment within two years after com pletion. A complete system of canals for dis tribution has been in operation many years, but without sufficient water to supply lands under it and the diver sion dam to be built will supply this defect. The members of the delegation looking after the matter are F. O. Traeey, A. M. Hovey, A. S. Freeman and Charles Ballard, all of Carlsbad. Reappointment of Raynolds. A Santa Fe dispatch says: The send ing of the name or James Wallace Raynolds to the Senate to-day by Pres ident Roosevelt to succeed himself as secretary of the territory of New Mex ico ended a memorable political fight for this, the most lucrative federal po sition In the territory. Two Rough Riders, Captain Fred Miller and Cap tain W. E. Dane, were after it and tho enemies of the territorial administra tion waged a bitter fight against Mr. Raynolds, who, with Governor M. A. Otero, H. O. Bursum and Solomon Luna, is one of the leaders of the ter ritorial Republican organization. ' Mr. Raynolds Is only thirty-three years old and was originally appointed by President McKlnloy to succeed Secre tary Wallace, formerly of Missouri, who died while in office.

SECRETARY OF INTERIOR SAYS THEY ARE BEING WASTED. ARID LAND RECLAMATION Would Retire Superannuated Clerks. Increased Land Sales Large DIs . Burtements for Pensions. Washington. In his annual report tho secretary of the interior says: "Many branches of the service have suffered by reason of the growing in capacity of some ot the clerical force, for which there Is no. adequate rem edy without doing injustice in many, cases. July 1, 1903, the number of em ployes of the department In Washing ton aggregated 4,166, of which number 758 were between 50 and 59 years of age, and 810 were 60 years and over. Some provision should be' made to meet existing conditions, and this can be effected by the nassage of a law providing for the retirement from duty under suitable conditions of aged gov ernment employes. "The vigorous manner in which tres pass upon the public timber and unlaw ful inclosures of the public domain are being Investigated and the offenders punished is creating a healthy public sentiment in the localities Involved and throughout the country that the law must be complied with. "Great progress has been made in the administration of the act of one 12, 1902 (32 Stat. L., 388), known as the reclamation net. Twelve projects are now under process of construction, and a number of others have been approved with a view to future construction. "One of tho most conspicuous facts that has heen developed by the so called land fraud and Investigations Is that the timber and stone act, the des ert land act, and commutation clause of the homestead law are the conven ient handmaidens of crime; that they have afforded the most effective means for the conspirators with which we have had to deal to fraudulently trans fer the title of the public do main from the government to them selves, and unless they are repealed or materially modified or amended sub stantially as heretofore repeatedly rec ommended In my annual reports and by the public lands commission, they will continue to constitute the most dangerous menace to the Integrity ot the public domain. "The policy, to which attention was invited in tho last annual report, of re quiring able-bodied Indians to labor for their own support, and of withholding rations from all but the sick and Indi gent, has been strictly ndhered to and Is becoming more and more popular with the mass ot Indian adults, since they realize that. It provides direct and tangible pecuniary benefits to all who will avail themselves of the opportu nities offered for self-help. "The operations under the reclama tion act have stimulated development of the West, in many lines and have aroused private enterprise to take up similar work. Experience, has shown that there ar many localities where, owing to the complications ot vested rights and partial development of the country, such private enterprise can conduct the work of reclamation to bet ter advantage than can the govern ment. On the other band, there are many localities where, because ot in terstate problems or the magnitude of the work, only national agencies can bring about the best, development. The work of the government is being con ducted in harmony with all such en terprises, whether under private, cor porate or state control. There is, how ever, a type of so-called private enter prise which is not merely seeking le gitimate investment, but. Is endeavor ing to fasten upon the country a water and land monopoly with the view or building up a tenantry population sim ilar to that existing in the older coun tries of the world. "There were disposed of during the fiscal year ended June ,10, 1905, public lands aggregating 17,056.622.27 acres, class! tied as follows: Cash sales, 1, 646,651.57; miscellaneous entries, em bracing homesteads, land warrants, scrip locations, Btate selections, swamp lands, railroad and wagon road selec tions, Indian allotments, etc., 15,332, 424.01 acres, and Indian lands, 77. 546.69 acres, showing an Increase of 650,800.02 acres as compared with the aggregate disposals for the preceding fiscal year. "The disbursements for pensions from July 1,1790. to June30, 1865, were $96.4 15444.23. Since 1865 the disburse ments for pensions were $3,224,414, 578.75, and for cost of maintenance and expenses $103,219,133.78, or a total of $3,327,633,712,53, baking the entire cost of the maintenance of the pension sys tem since the foundation of the govern ment, $3,424,079,156.76. This Is exclu sive of the cost of the establishment of tho various soldiers' homes and ot bounty, land warrants granted, amount ing to nearly 69,000,000 ncres. "The present system of examining Applicants for pension is a most uncer tain, expensive and unsatisfactory method, the system being liable to out side control and political dictation, nnd generating an enormous amount of po litical friction." Confederates Praise Roosevelt. Dallas, Tex. Sterling Price ump of United Confederate Veterans held a large meeting Sunday and discussed the recommendation in President Roosevelt's message to Congress for national care of Confederate grows In northern states, and also the expres sions of the President on the Monroe doctrine.

PROLONG LIFE. Testimony of Healthy Octogenarian Vegetarian. Our vegetarian friends are getting fat, healthy and saucy. They eat no meat and wax strong, and In athletics they win prizes. The other night the London vegetarians met at Memorial hall, and the bills announcing the meeting bore the legend: "Not too old at Forty! Still Young at Eighty!" The chairman was Mr. C. P. New combe, aged eighty, and around him were gathered seven other octogen arians, "blooming with health and wearing buttonholes of carnations." Mr. Newcombe was wise and chipper. He drew a vivid contrast between veg etarians and flesh eaters. The latter, he said, were screwed up with gout and bent down by rheumatism, while their excited hearts gave them florid complexions which an exasperated liver turned yellow and green. Dr. Mayor, professor of Latin at Cambridge University, a sprightly lad of eighty, said he never sat down at the "groaning board," laden with meat dishes but that he felt as If in a pil lory. He had not touched tobacco for seventy-two years, some cigars which he essayed at the tender age of eight years effected a permanent cure of the tobacco habit for him'. Then arose Mr. T. A. Hanson, aged eighty-seven, a younger looking man, and related that when seventy-two years he broke a leg. It was the opinion of the doc tors that his "advanced age" would prevent the bone from knitting. But It did, and the Injured leg Is now the bet ter of the two. When eighty-two he broke two ribs, but they were right in two weeks. He was sure his vege tarian life was to be credited with his vitality. Tennessee Praise. Dayton, Tenn., Dec. 11th (Special) Among many prominent residents to praise Dodd's Kidney Pills Is Mr. N. R. Roberts of this place. He tells ot what they have done for him, and his words will go deep Into the hearts of all who are suffering la the same way. H says: "I was a martyr to Kidney Trouble, but Dodd's Kidney Pills completely cured me. I shall always keep them on hand in case there should be any return of the o'.d trouble, but I am thankful to say they did their work so well there has not been the slight est sign of my old complaint coming back. The pain In my back used to be terrible. If I got down I had a hard Job to get straight again. But my back Is like a new one now and I can stoop as much as I please. I don. believe there ever was any medicine half so good as Dodd's Kidney Pills." Girl Champion Corn Husker.

She recently told her father she hp lleved she could husk more corn than her brothers. He said If she could he would buy her a new piano. She soon beat her brothers, then told her father she Intended to win ' th Hn corn-husklng championship. He said If she were successful she might go to scnooi. She succeeded. They Came From Missouri. Lnst week there was at Nogales a man from Missouri, with a family con slsting of a wife and six small chil dren, who surely belie the well known Idea that Missouri "have to be shown." He had sold everything in his native state and started for Sinaloa without having ever seen or known anything of tho country, save that he had read about cheap land and fertility ot the soil. He didn't know where It was, or where he was going, or whnt to do when he got somewhere; nnd, more over, could not speak a word of Span- jbu.

BRAIN WORKER. Must Have the Kind of Food That Nourishes Brain. "I am a literary man whose nervous energy Is a great part of my Block in trade, and ordinarily I have little pa tience with breakfast foods and the extravagant claims made of them. Bui I cannot withhold my acknowledg ment of the debt that I owe to Grape- Nuts rood. "I discovered long ago that the very bulklness of the ordinary diet was not calculated to give one a clear head, the power of sustained, accurate thlnklne. I always felt heavy and sluggish In mind as well as body after eating the ordinary meal, which diverted the blood from tbe brain to the digestive apparatus. 1 "I tried foods easy of digestion, but .found them usually deficient In nutrt meni. i experimented with many breakfast foods and they, too, proved unsatisfactory, till I reached Grape Nuts. And then the problem was solved. "Grape-Nuts agreed with me per fectly from tbe beginning, satisfying my hunger and supplying the nutrl ment that so many other prepared foods lack. "I had not been using it very long before I found that I was turning out an unusual quantity and quality of work. Continued use has demonstrat ed to my, entire satisfaction that Grape-Nuts food contains all the ele ments needed by the brain and perv- ous Bystem of the hard working publlo writer."
