THE HOME MARKET IDEA. ( The nations of Europe seem very { much inclined to indulge us in our > pet idea of a home market, (iermany i first refused our beef and live cattle j on the flimsy excuse that the cattle > were affected with pleuro-pneumonia. i Jsow she is objecting to our petroleum, j and the reason they give for this is i that our best wells have all run out and the article we are now sending * them is much inferior to that former- J ly exported. I Our people say that both of these ‘ charges are false and that Germany’s > action is merely because of an un- , friendly feeling towards us and a de- j sire to restrict our trade with that ' country. Very probably this is true, i The present Emperor of Germany is , as narrow-minded as many of our ' great statesmen. If the Germans are . in a condition to wall themselves in j (and if they are not, it is no business j of ours,) they have a perfect right to ' do so. With their limited understand- , ing of our political affairs they un- ( doubtedly think that the result of our i late elections was an overwhelming | victory for high tariff and restricted j trade. This may have had some ef fect on her late unfriendly commer- ] cial actions towards us, but at any i rate there does not seem to be any , things we can do to remedy it. Eng- 1 laud and France are also doing all iu their power to assist us iu our pet theory and they only buy from us that which they can not possibly do without. One of our great statemen said a few ' years ago that the United States was in a condition to build a Chinese wall i all around the country, and that we ! would be greatly benefited by doing ' so. China is a good example of the wall business. She has her great wall of stone and mortar which is indeed > of little consequence, but for ages she , has had a commercial wall around her borders, and although of late years ; some comparative wicket gates have been opened to restricted commerce, 1 her general situation is one of isola tion,except where the Japanese armies | have broken through the outer walls ’ and entered their sacred precincts.— i China, containing more than four \ hundred millions of inhabitants, has ever kept apart from all other peoples, and now we behold her defeated and ' suing for peace to a few islanders j whose gross population does not > amount to one tenth of her own. Let ns have no commercial walls j around our country but let all the : seas of the world be one highway | where our ships can carry away our 1 overproductions, and bring back the things we need from other countries. , Our farmers produce much more than 1 I we can use without extravagant waste ; and the output of our manufactories | is much beyond our home demand. If 1 * \ we import nothing we raise no reve- i nue to support the government. In j| that ease the exceedingly nii|>opular j direct tax would have to come, and \ woe be to the party that would be ' compelled to enforce it. Would it not, then, be better to drop the fad of an exclusive home market and buy and sell with the whole world, laying 1 a duty on imports sufficient for the support of an ecomomic government, t which ought to be sufficient in all ! reason to protect our home manufact- ' ories against the lower wages paid c in other countries ? j _ * 1 

PRICES OP FARM PRODUCTS. t The December Crop report, of the { Department of Agiculture, relates t principally to the average farm prices • of the various agricultural products f on the first day of the month. By farm J prices is meant the price of a product i on the farm or in the nearest local 1 • 0 market. The farm prices of corn averaged 45.6 cents per bushel, which is t 9.1 cents higher than the correspond- | ing price of last year, which was 36.5 u cents per bushel. This price is 6.3 <j cents per bushel higher than the aver- age price for the decade of 1880 to 1889, “ and isjnst 4 cents higher than the average for the four years 1890 to 1893. The average price of wheat is 49.8 cents per bushel, the lowest price in J the past twenty-five years. The price is t; 33.9 cents less than the average for the 1 ten years 1880 to 1889, and is 22.1 cents * less than the average for the four years j 1890 to 1893. The returns show the ® average price of hay to be $8.35 per s ton, while that of last year on the c farms was $9.18. The average price e for 1892 was $8.49. The higher price P last year was caused by the short crop, both at home and abroad. J THE ROADS. f The recent rainy weather has made C a fine opening for the newlyorganized J; road leagues to prove their usefulness. “ They can do but little, however, to p remedy the present condition, as their work must necessarily be preventa tive, but the state of our highways should arouse citizens to the import- e' ance of the matter and cause them to add to their efforts to put things in ti better shape for bad weather the next £ time. They now have a splendid op- ti portunity, also, to see where piking T is needed most. Of course, as long as - earth and water will mix and form mud we must have our dirt roads in a more or less bad condition daring the g ■winter season, but much of this can a; be averted by paying proper attention - to drainage. The man who devotes c his time and money to the improve- d inept of his country's highways is ful- r, ly as deserving of the gratitude of his „ fellow citizens as he who serves them f ‘ on the battle field. —A new treaty lias been negotiated between the United States and Japan which will apparently be quite ad vantageous to both countries. It re cognizes Japan as a first-class power and concedes that the laws and courts of Japan are good enough-to try Ameri can citizens, doing away with the old consular courts. Japan is also given the right to make her own tariff laws, she having heretofore been forbidden by treaty from flxingduties above 5 per cent, ad valorem. The United States is guaranteed freedom of worship and proper protection for missionaries.— The greatest concession, however, is the opening of the entire country of Japan to American commerce, which has hertofore been confined to a few treaty ports. The treaty, to be effec tive, must be ratified by both coun tries within the next six months. 0 + —ln the Senate on Wednesday Sen ator Gray, of Delaware, made a mo tion to repeal the differential protec tive duty in favor of the sugar refiners. Senators Morgan, Blanchard and Mar tin voted with the Republicans and Populists who were arrayed solidly against the measure. The Republi cans love to twit Democrats with fav oring the trust, but when it comes to voting the record shows which party upholds monopoly. —Count Ferdinand de Lesseps, the famous canal projector, died on Fri day,December 7,at Lacheuaie,France, in the ninetieth year of his age. Waaliingtou Letter. From Our Regular Correspondent. Washington, December 10.—The Demo crats in Congress have surprised everybody, including themselves, during the past week. Instead of the bickerings which were expected and predicted by Democrats as well us mem bers of the other parties, they have been quiet ly at work and have actually succeeded in mapping out a partial programme of legisla tion which they expect to pass. They held no caucus in the House, but are acting upon gen eral consent of the party in pushing the Fithian free ship bill and the two appropriation bills— pensions and fortifications, which have been re ported. The railroad pooling bill, now before the House, isn't regarded as a p diticul meas ure. The Democrats of the House committee on Hanking and Currency, who were hopelessly at sea during the last session, have announced their intention to report a currency bill before the holiday recess, and it is an open secret that It will be very near to the recommendations made by Secretary Carlisle and endorsed by President Cleveland's message an extension of national bank currency and an authorization of state bank currency under proper safe guards. This week the committee will grant hearings to u number ot prominent financiers, beginning to-day with Secretary Carlisle. The ideals to get the bill reported before the re cess so that it can le fully discussed by the public before the reassembling of Congress. The Democratic Senators wisely concluded to ignore what they could not agree upon and instructed the steering committee to arrange un order of business to cover the following: A bankruptcy bill; bills for the admission of Arizona and New Mexico; Nicaragua Canal bill, and a bill involving the interests of Indian Territory, leaving the question of precedence to the discretion of the steering committee. These things are very gratifying to the average Democrat, and if they continue through the session will put the party in fairly good shape. It seems almost a pity to point to the ugly feet of Mr. Peacock llabcoek when he is ex hibiting such a beautiful tail, embellished in illuminated colors with the claims of what he accomplished in the late campaign as Chairman of the Republican Congressional Committee, nut the following conversation between two Republican Congressman is so apt that it must be recorded‘*l would like to know," said Keprescntative Hepburn, of lowa, "just what good the Republican campaign committee did in the late election. I would like to have some one name the district in which the committee did anything." "Well,” replied Representative Powers,of Vermont, to whom the remarks were addressed. "It did something in Houk's district inTt nnessee and in M urray's in South Carolina. And in both districts the Republican candidates were beaten." "Just so," said Mr. Hepburn. "The first time I heard from the committee was a letter saying the committee could supply me withcampaign literature and that my check for a comfortable sura would be acceptable. The next was a letter after the election saying that in consideration of a Mr. Mc- Kee's services as Secretary of the com mittee, he ought to be elected clerk of the next House. When the time comes to ap point another committee I shall recite these and a few other facts, and move that the com mittee be abolished." Mr. Habcock has been throwing stones at the McKinley boom. Chairman Hatch, of the House Committee on Agriculture, was oueof the slain, but bis greet ing to ex-Speaker Reed shows that his wit is still alive —"Reed, I want to congratulate you, I have in part represented the Slate of Missouri in Congress a good many years, and I thought I knew something about it, but I am ready to acknowledge that you know more about Mis souri than I do. 1 read the speech you made in St. Louis with great disgust. You said the peo ple of Missouri were good people except that they didn’t have sense enough to know how to vote. I'm blessed if you weren't right." Delegate Rawlins, of Utah, has notified Sec retary Smith that if the Governor does not re move the Ute Indians from Utah the people will drive them out by force. He says he fears that an Indian war will be the outcoraeof the present difficulties, owing to the depredations of the Indians, which, he says, have reached the unbearable stage. An equity suit has been begun in the Su preme Court of the District of Columbia by H. L. Preston, a Kansas City newspaper proprie tor, and H. L. Strohm, of Kansas City, against John Wodderburn, manager of the "Press Claims Co., of Washington, and W. 11. Hearst, of the ‘’Examiner bureau of Claims," for the can cellation of a contract, said to have been ob tained by misrepresentation, made by Preston with the Press Claims C 0.," in which Preston agreed to take stock in that company, upon the representation that it was valuable, as pay for advertising. Mr. Preston asked that the com pany be compelled to pay him SB4O in cash for the advertising he has done and to take back its stock which he doesn’t want. C. A. 8. Catarrh Can’t be Cured with

Is not an isosceles triangle a right angled triangle when the equal angles at the base are each angles of forty-five degrees, leaving the angle at the apex an angle of ninety degrees, or a right angle? Now if we comprehended Mr. Henderson’s problem, either a right-angled isosceles triangle or an isosceles right-angled triangle answers the conditions. For if a per pendicular be drawn from the apex to the base, two partial triangles are formed equal to each other and similar to the whole trian gle, for the perpendicular bisects the right angle, giving in each triangle two angles of forty-five degress each and a right angle, and the same division may be made with similar results ad infinitum. We looked to see G., of Delta, defend his solution, which was un doubtedly correut, if we understood Mr. Hen derson’s problem. Oakland School. ♦ ♦ - —Mr. Iru P.

The said Canal Companies on the second day of January, 1872. made a lease of thpir Canal and ail their works and property to Hie said Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company for ulue-hundred and ninety-nine years for the rent and upon the termsset out and charged in the lease ; and that said lease was BiiTri;nderod by the receivers of said Railroad Company on the ‘27th of April, 1894. That for many years said Canal Companies made default upon their mortgages to the Bsutc of Maryland, and'that on the 31st of January, 1889, under authority conferred by the Maryland Act of 1888, Chap ter 154, a settlement and compromise was ef fected by L* Victor liaughmaß, Comptroller<if the Treasury, with the approval of Elßiii B. Jackson, Governor, and Stevenson Archer, * Treasurer of Maryland, whereby in considera , tlon of the payment of $127,500.00, being twenty-five per cent, of the over due and un paid interest upon said mortgages to the State of Maryland, a release was executed to said Canal Companies of the balance of said unpaid interest; the time for the payment of the priiL -9 ciple of one million dollars was extended for fifty years maturing in 1938. and the rate of interest on said mortgage debt was reduced from six per cent, to two per cent, per annum; that said Canal Companies paid said Interest up to and including the first day of Jan uaty, 1893, but have paid no interest since that time. r That the Canal was operated by said Philadel phia and Reading Railroad Company under the lease of January 2, 1872, until the 27th of April,lß94, when it was abandoned,and that the . Canal is now lying idle.and daily deteriomting in value, and that it has no business or reve nues sufficient to pay the operating expenses * and interest on the debts of said Canal Com panies; that said companies owe a mortgage due* in 1918. bearing six per cent, interest amounting to $1,336 000: also a mortgage due * in 1902, bearing interest at the rate of seven * per cent, amounting to $257,000; also unfund ed debt for equipment, etc., amounting to , $21,282.33; also unlunded debt being unpaid 5 interest on their bonded debt, amounting to * 8538,235.18, in addition to the unpaid interest - due to the State of Maryland, and that said companies are hopelessly insolvent. It is thereupon, this 7th day of December, 1 1894, by the Circuit Court for Harford county. 5 sitting in Equity, ordered that the plaintiff, by causing a copy of this order to be inserted in two newspapers, once a week, for four con secutive weeks before the 12th day of January, r 1895, give notice to the Philadelphia and Read ing Railroad Company, a non-resident corpora tion, and to the unknown holders of the Susqu ehanna Canal Preferred Bonds which matured on January 1, 1894, and the unknown holders of the Tide Water Canal Priority Bonds-which matured on January 1, 1894, non-residents as . well as residents of this State, of the object and substance of the said bill, and warning them to be and appear in this court, in person or by so licitor, on or before the 30tli any of January, 1895, to answer said bill, and to show cause if any they have, why a decree should not pass as I prayed.
