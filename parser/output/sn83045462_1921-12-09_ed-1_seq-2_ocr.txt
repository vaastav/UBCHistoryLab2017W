NEW ROADS URGED IN FEDERALPARKS National Reservation Head Cites Worthwhile Diver sions, Says Report. THOUSANDS ENJOY VIEWS Director Stephen T. Mather Advo cates Touring; Division to Stim ulate Interest. The national parks head the list of t^ose worth-while things in the na tional life of the American, making better citizens by providing healthful diversion, recreation and enjoyment und offering unequaled advantages In educational fields, in the opinion of Stephen T. Mather, direotor of the na tional park service, in his annual re - liort to Secretary Kail of the Interior 1M partmcnt. made public today. It took the world war t? Impress this rountry with the realization of Its si cat scenic treasures, the report said, thousands of tired minds and bodies turning to the national parks for roc re;. tioit and pleasure at its close. Tra\el increased in leaps and bounds uulil the park tourist facilities were o\erwhelmed. but still the crowds <:ime. In 1?S1. 1.171.787 persons vis ited the parks and monuments under tlx jurisdiction of the national park service, the number being 113,342 more than visited these areas last year, while in 1916. only 358.0S7 visitors were recorded. Rwkr Mountains Moat Popular. Of the nineteen parks patronized last year, the Rocky mountains of Colorado seemed to have held the greatest attraction. 273,737 persons having visited that ground, the report showed. The Hot Springs of Arkan sas were second in interest. 130,388 p< rsons having visited it during last ><ar. The following parks also had a very large attendance: Yellowstone, Wyoming; Yosemite. California; Mount Rainier. Washington! Piatt. Oklahoma; Grand Canyon, Arizona, and Lafayette. Maine. The remain ing parks had a tourist average of iil-out 17,000 each. An average of about 5,000 persons visited each of the thirteen principal monuments, but the Muir Woods- of California showed 87,400 visitors and the Petrified Forest, in Arizona. 32.70* travelers. Development of a national good roads system with government aid and the location of roads to and within the various national parks and monuments to complement this national system are advocated by Mr. Mather. "The parks are the lodestones of travel In their respective localities," he said, "and unless roads inside the parks to match those traversed to the park gate? are provided our park visitors will be dis appointed and travel will finally suffer." Camp Grounds Established. Free public camp grounds have been established in the national parks, as the result of the large increase of pri vate motor travel, the report said. These camps are provided with sanitary factiities. firewood and pure water, and the report emphasized the Interest taken in western cities and towns In supplying camping accommodations to visiting motorists. In two of tha camp grom.ds in Yellowstone, the report con tinued. combined ranger station* and community houses were constructed this vear at a coat of $18,M0. Visit* to the park bv motor travel have bean'greatly facilitated and stimulated by the desig nation in 1320 of the National Park to- Park highway, which touches in one preat circle the major natftnST parks in the west. But the government has not given all Its attention to motorists. Hiking ; has been encouraged by particular ? effort in the past year, by furnishing j visitors definite itineraries for walk ing trips. "The suggested (rips were taken up enthusiastically ahd special hiking trails were created." the report said. "In fact." it continued, "the hiking and horseback trips in .tJi* parks added the greatest fascination to a vacation." . , Touring Division Advocated. Establishment of a touring division under the national park service to develop and stimulate touring as one ? of the profitable industries of the 5 United States to combat the "strong I and systematic campaigns" br for eign countries in the United States to restore their one-time large tourist travel, is advocated by Director Mather. "The time is here." he said, "when this nation will have to take steps to compete for world travel as other nations are doing." He pointed out that the national park develop ment in foreign countries has fol lowed the development in the United States, and that there is no country of importance that has not taken some steps toward setting aside scenic areas as national reservations. Mr. Mather also advocated the de velopment of interesting ooenlc as cents in the various states through out the country that have parks un der their control. "Tt is hoped." the reort said, "that in time a state park will be found every hundred miles or so along the main highways, which will afford camping-out places for motorists. The state park movement was auspiciously begun in conference at Des Moines. Iowa, in January. MM." Wild Life Preserved. "Wild life conservation is one of tha most satisfying functions of the national parks," the report con tinued. "for complete and absolute protection is afforded their wild life. In the larger parks one is almost sure to see deer, bear and other na tive game on or along the roads and trails. Greater co-operation from the states in providing adequate lawa and preserves to give additional pro tection to animals which drift out side the park is asked." In Yellowstone National Park the ?wild animal herds showed gratifying increases, the report said, stating I hat the buffalo herd has grown so rapidly that it will soon present dif ficulties in the way of feeding and control. Fishing is excellent in all the larger parks, the report continued, as the lakes and streams are Kept well stocked through co-operation with the United States bureau of fisheries and several state fisheries. ?w Park fa Hawaii. During the year the Hawaiian Na tional Park was dedicated to the na tion and the Hot Springs Reserva tion. set aside as such in 1832. was ttiven national park status by Con gress March 4. The most impor tant development in this park/ the report said, "was the completion of the new free public bathhouse for ihe treatment of the Indigent sick who annually seek; health through Ihs use of hot waters." Among the new park projects, the report pointed out. the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky and the Utah National I'ark have high merit, while a num ber of proposed national monuments, one to reserve the stately Washington palm in southern California, is urged. The report then takes up several of the parks and monuments separately, noting road construction and Improve ments in each as well as the estab lishment or furtherance of camping facilities. ( Gifts Arc Acknowledged. Gifts of lands and monsr from ' publio-spirited" citizens are acknowl eired. In tha report, the most "notable" of the year being, the report said, a f

With this placard, and others in similar vein, adorning their sides. 150 trucks of the Washington city post office paraded through the streets of the National Capital to day in the annual pre-Christmas parade. A life and drum corps ' from Quantlco led the parade, -in which the "rolling post office" and k new armored truck were objects of par ticular interest. Ernest U. Greer, a carrier, played the role of Santa Claus, being dressed in full re galia. whiskers and all. Postmaster Chance and other of ficials of the Washington city post office rode in one of the trucks. The parade attracted much atten tion as It wended through the crowded streets at the noon-time period. square mile of land within the heart of the Sequoia National Park, Calif., which was purchased at a cost of $36,000. through the National Geographic Society. In Lafayette National Park. Me., over a thousand acres of land were donated to the park, which will pass to the government after certain im provements have been made by the donors. Former Representative William Kent of California donated 118 acres of )and to the Muir Woods National Monument, the report said. The report reviewed the conditional objection of Secretary Kail of pro posals to utilize some of the national parks for power and irrigation pur poses, and said "an act of vital im portance to the national parks was passed when Congress by the act of March 3. 1931, amended the federal power act, permitting water power development in the national parks and monuments, by withdrawing the application of that act to the then existing national parks." Total Ana IMS* Square Miles. The total area of the nineteen parks is 10.S59 square miles and the area of the twenty-four national monuments is 1,810 square miles. This property is valued at "many tens of millions of dollars." There is only one national park in the Hawaiian Islands and one in Alaska, the report says, and Lafay ette. in Maine, is the only national park east of the Mississippi. The annual upkeep of these areas has cost the government very little, the report states, requiring only $1, 402,209 from Congress this past year, of which $316,000 was for new road projects. Revenues derived from the operation of the parks, however, amounted to about $400,000, the report showed. Possibility of airplane transportation in the Grand Canyon National Park. | Aria, has attracted much Interest. I the report said. An Array aviator made fourteen test flights in all kinds of weather and at different hours of the day and the remit seemed to prove practicability of flying across the canyon, the report said. The Interior I>epartment, however, is not yet ready to approve the installation of air plane passenger service, according to the report. fundtoronecook AT healthschool Education Board Acknowl edges Donation From Tu berculosis Association. ~ Receipt of a letter from Harry O.

DYESTUFFS LOBBY PROBE I Senate Committee to Investigate Frelinyhuysen Charges. Investigation is to be made by the Senate judiciary committee into the i alleged dyestuffs lobby. The Senate yesterday adopted the resolution of Senator King of Utah ordering such a probe. Senator Frelinghuysen. republican. New Jersey, charged in the Senate that Germany, in her efforts to regain supremacy in the dye and chemical industries, had "organised and I ?financed a movement that already had invaded both hpuees of Congress." The New Jersey senator also de clared that tha inquiry must include activities of German representatives as well as those of Americana. He urged that an embargo be placed on Imports of dyestuffs in order to head off "made in Germany" goods. MRS. OYSTER FILES SUIT ON CONTRACT (Continued from First Pure.) in tbe will of her husband, hu failed to include as an asset of the estate the value of the dairy business of Mr. Oyster. This business has been net tin* $100,000 annually, the widow states, and should be valued at least 11,000,000. She claims that Mr. Braw ner Influenced her husband, while he was suffering from the disease which caused his death a few weeks later, to execute the agreement by which he was declared to have a 45 per cent Interest in the business, and under which the surviving partner was en titled to purchase the Interest of the dead partner at appraised value. Mrs. Oyster claims that Mr. Brawner did not pay value for the 45 per cent se cured under the contract and asks the court to vacate the attempted sale of the other 55 per cent of the business to him. She also charges that Mr. Brawner has "emphatically stated his hostility to her and has manifested it on several occasions. Says Hones Wrongly belated. Mrs. Oyster also declares that Mr. Brandenburg in selling the Oyster interest under the alleged contract has attempted to include a number of thoroughbred horses and a farm of 200 acres near Walkerville. Md., worth $100,000, which, the widow as serts, had nothing to do with the dairy business. The young widow tells the court that she and her husband left TVash iiiKton on their honeymoon in Janu ary for Florida and that their rela tions proceeded smoothly and agree ably until Henry X. Brawner. jr.. after long-distance calls, paid a visit to Florida and "influenced and per suaded George M. Oyster, jr.. to leave the plaintiff suddenly on March 11 in Florida, where her mother and sister were guests of Mr. Oyater." After her return to Washington, she states, her husband became cold and even hostile toward her and his manner continued "unkind, irritable, unreas onable, cold nnd hostile" until ha went to Atlantic City, where he died. Uxefstar Declines Statement. Mr. Brandenburg, the executor, stated today that he had nothing to say other than that the appraisers, who officiated in the case are ap pointees of the court, over whom no executor or administrator has any control. These court appraisers, he said, called to their assistance an expert from Sloan's, another expert on paintings from the Smithsonian and a third expert on Jades.

When the excitement had subsided Senator Watson announced that he desired the committee to call sixty three. witnesses whose names he pre sented, along with a great volume ofi letters. There was some informal dls- 1 cussion. much milder in tone than^ that which preceded the row.

Senator Watson protested earlier Jn the hearings today against the de* cision of the commJtte to confine the' inquiry solely to the question of hang ings.

"My charges were broader. 1 protest against these charges being nar rowed. 1 want it understood that 1 an going into the shooting of men by their officers." The committee suggested that it might be necessary to go before the Senate and ask that the resolution directing the inquiry be enlarged. "Col. Theodore Roosevelt. Jr.. cor roborates my statement that a soldier was shot by an oflloer." Senator Wat son declared. "It was testified at the trial that the officer shot the sol dier without provocation whatso ever." "Do you want CoL Roosevelt called as a witness?" the senator was asked. "No. I would not embarrass him." Will Recess tor Week. Senator Watson said he had no wit nesses to present today, adding that he proposed to try the case on the floor of the Senate. The committee decided at its ex ecutive session to hear Col. Bethel. Maj. Cocheu and other Army officers at the session tomorrow if they de sired to appear.

ANGLO-JAPAN TREATY SEEN IN FOUR-POWER PACT Signatory Nations Would Agree Not to War Over Pacific Issues for One Year. U. S. Would Gain?Delegates Meet. BY PAIL. SCOTT HOW'RER AND LE ROTf T. VKR\ON. The fact seems to be firmly estab lished that a four-power arbitration agreement Is now under consideration by the United States, Britain, Japan and Prance. Balfour, Hughes, Kato and Viviani met late yesterday for the first time In thia matter, following various Informal preliminary conver sations. The real object of the agree ment is supposed to be the abrogation of the Anglo-Japanese alliance and the substitution therefor of an elabo ration of the principle of the so-called Bryan treaties. According to this In terpretation, the signatory powers would agree not to go to war, In any question relating to their respective territories In the Paclflc until the lapse of a year's time. X? Bearing on China. While the four-power agreement is supposed to have no direct bearing either on the China question or tiie naval limitation question, its final adoption is believed to be contingent upon the satisfactory solution of both these questions. Apparently the only power which is ready immediately to conclude tile agreement is Great Brit ain. At yesterday's meeting Japan is said to have been able to present only a partial report on the attitude of the Japanese government, owing to 'a confusion of cable dispatches. France, which had been admitted to the project only on Thursday evening, had not yet received instructions from Paris. The participation by Chairman Hughes in the discussion Is interpreted here to mean that the United States has accepted the Idea "in principle." Several days may elapse before the plan has attained so definite a shape that it can be publicly announced. Abrogntinn. V. S. Demand. The abrogation of the Anglo-Jap anese alliance has been recognized by both Britain and Japan from the very beginning as a fundamental American demand. To this end the first proposal made by Britain and Japan was that the alliance should be extended to include the United States. The re fusal of the American delegates was firm and immediate. The next sug gestion. also apparently originating with Britain and Japan, was that the arbitration principle embodied In the Bryan treaties should be extended to a three-power Pacific agreement, which should at the same time abro gate the Anglo-Japanese alliance. This Idea Is understood to have proved more acceptable to the United States, but only on condition that France be included. Obviously, In a three-power agreement the United States would risk finding- itself frequently in the minority. The Inclusion of France, which Is the only other large power with Pacific Interests, would seem to Insure a balance of power within the agreement. Yield Amrrlraa Petal. Both Britain and Japan argued that the agreement should be limited to the three great naval powers. While cablegrams were passing back and forth between Toklo. W? hin-; on and London, the American delegates con tinued to insist upon their viewpoint. I Meanwhile, the Frenah delegation, i having ascertained the trend of the , informal conversations, was following events with the closest interest. It was not until Wednesday that Britain and Japan yielded the point to Amer ica. The came evening Chairman Hughes notified the French delegates that their participation in the agree ment would be welcome, and furnish ed them with a statement of the progress of the negotiations, which was promptly cabled to Paris. The first meeting of Rene Vivian! with the three other principal allied delegates was held yesterday afternoon. Italy Keenly Iatemted. Italy, too. is watching the negoti ations with keen attention. The policy which its delegates are un derstood to have adopted is that, so long as the agreement affects only Pacific territories and not Interna tional principles, Italy cannot ask to participate, because it has no Pacific territories. Holland, on the other hand, which Is not a naval power, but which has a colonial empire in Pa cific waters, is believed to be press ing for admission. While it is still obviously too early to form a definite judgment with re gard to the proposed four-power agreement. the information now available seems to indicate It is really merely a development of an accepted American principle of international relations. Without prejudice to eith er the naval ratio or far eastern issues, the United States apparently surrenders nothing, except the right to go to war in Pacific questions within the delay of one year. It gains, on the other hand, the abroga tion of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, which has been considered by the American government to be contrary to American Interests. (Copyright. 1*21.) Sidelights on the Conference There are few Idle moments for| delegates to the conference and other i delegation officials, down <to the olerks. There seems to be no such thing for them as regular hours, and some of them admit fatigue now and then. "I enjoy hard work; on the other hand. I am already looking forward ! to a good rest when it's all ovec," I said the secretary of one delegation : the other day. "I have a country i place high up in the mountains In a j far corner of my native land. There ! is no telephone. There is not even a; railroad and telegraph. It's a fine place to recuperate, and I am going | there when It's all over, for an indef-, inite stay. First, however. I want to see something of Amrica. and I'd like to take a trip of a few weeks through your wonderful country. This is my first visit, and I not only have not seen America, but have scarcely seen Washington yet." Another member of a delegation i was talking about how interesting, even fhfflllng. is participation in the cotiference and all its sittings. He I has" been many places and seen much , that was important, and counts it a great privilege to be here. A news- . paper man remarked that he envied' the delegate's ability to see and know ' everything, while, he. the newspaper! 

INDIA MADE HOPEFUL | BY IRISH PROCEEDINGS r Representative at Arms Meeting Talks With Newspaper Men on Situation There. * V -1 The reported settlement of the Irish question is bound to react upon In dia. a spokesman representing India at the Washington conference de clared last night in a talk with rep resentatives of the <>ress. Id his opinion India in the end will be granted the same measure or in pendence that other branches of the British empire now have. He said that the nationalist movement in In dia probably would receive impetus from the reported settlement made with Ireland. He suggested that it might lead to trouble from some of the rebellious elements in the coun try. j The spokesman for-India criticised the Anglo-Japanese alliance which, he [said, was opposed generally in India J because of the clause which was ln I terpreted as providing for the impor tation- b< Japanese troops if there ! was anjr disturbance in India, wheth I er the .trouble arose from outside In Idiu ?r on the inside. He said that the j [ people of India resetted the idea of Japanese troops being allowed to set; foot in India. Soviet Russia was referred to by1 the spokesman for India as a possible ! menace to India. He said that India j was particularly interested in the' Washington conference because of the i proposal to limit armaments. He said that he hoped some day this move- I I ment for the limitation of armament j would redound to the benefit of In dia. ! The new constitution for India, he I said, was being generally accepted. I In one or two places, however, the electors had refused to nominate can- ! didates for office. Questioned as to the report that 60 out of 120 prisoners in India, confined 1 in -a railway wagon, had died from I I thirst and suffocation, the spokesman for India said that the incident had! | happened, he understood, but that he n.an. via more or less "on the outside looking in." "You're wrong: there," he was told. "You members of the press really are better off than we are. You eventu ally know as much as we do: you see the spectacular, the inspiring side of things. The part you miss, and that we don't, is the drudgery, the endless discussions, the tedious delays that go on behind the acenes. Instead of your envying me. it should be the other way." The inscrutable expression or. per haps. lack of expression on Admiral Baron Kato's face is fascinating to the average American. When he talks with press representatives their eyes never wander from the slender mask like countenance of the great sea fighter and diplomat. They wonder what is going on behind that mask. It appears that the fascination ex tends to representatives of foreign governments, also "I can hardly take my eyes off his; face." said a representative of a Eu-' ropean power. His expression is so enigmatic. Yet, it is a gracious ex pression and sometimes, to me, a sad one: as if the wearer, thoroughly ex-i perienced both in war and politics, were the victim of conflicting emo tions. foreseeing trouble if Japan does not disarm, and, again, trouble if she does." did not believe the government had been in any way responsible. He ex pressed the opinion that the careless ness of some subordinate had been the cause of this happening. SAN FRANCISCO CHINESE PROTEST ARMS PARLEY Students, Sympathetic With South China.

December 9.?A parade in protest against "direct ne gotiation" of the 8hantung question y China and Japan and alio against what they term the "secret diplo macy" of the conference at Washing ton to discuss the limitation of arma ment and far eastern questions was held yesterday by many hundreds of Chinese students who are sympathetic with the South China, or Canton, gov ernment. The marchers carried banners on which were prnited "We Will Stand for No Humbug." "Secret Diplomacy Will Ruin World Peace" and other legends.

CONVICT HOLDS UP PRISON FLEES AFTER 5-HOUR RULE (Continued from First Page.) cede him to the apartment*. Just out Side the walla, occupied by Warden E. H. Dempiey and hie family. The nurse awakened them and Slaughter forced them to accompany him to the death cell, where they were locked up. He told them he would not harm them, and, later, showing a peculiar trait of character, brought them a pot 6f coffee, with cream, sugar and cups. Slaughter then threw the gates of the penitentiary wide open, and lei surely set about outltttlng himself and companions with civilian clothes from the commissary. What else was done until 2:30 o'clock is not known, for all except the seven men were locked up. At 2:10 o'clock Warden Dempsey said he heard a car move out from the penitentiary, and, with the aid of prisoners above, who cut a hole through the floor at his direction, he escaped from the death cell and spread the alarm. Takes Woman's Amto. Slaughter took an automobile be longing to Mrs. Dempsey and stripped the tires from a Ford roadster be longing to Edward Dempsey, son of the warden. Slaughter is twenty-six years old. His career of crime, as given to an Associated Tress correspondent at the time of his first Incarceration in the prison here, started when he was fourteen years old. He was reared in Southern Arkansas, he said, and when fourteen was convicted of grand lar ceny and sentenced to the Arkansas reform school, and then drifted to Oklahoma. He has participated in numerous bank robberies in Arkan sas. Oklahoma, Texas. Missouri and elsewhere. He escaped twice from the Texas , penitentiary and his term in Texas was unexpired when he killed Deputy Sheriff Brown in Hot Springs a little over a year ago. Slaughter denied a killing credited to him in Pennsylvania. but admitted that he had taken part in many rob beries. The desperado, who had been con sidered the most dangerous in the Ar kansas penal Institution, made an un successful attempt to escape from the prison farm at Tucker whea hs killed the trusty guard. BmM He Wnli Wat Diet This attempt was only slightly !??? spectacular than the one last night and bolder. Slaughter frequently boasted he would not go to the elec trio chair. At Hot Springs he and his cell were searched dally for weapons and Implements with which he might effect his escape, but none was found. After a jury returned a verdict of life imprisonment he turned over to the guards, who included a company of national guardsmen, a handful of hacksaws, remarking that if the sen tence had been death he would not have stayed In jail overnight. The state guard was called out on another occasion just about a year ago to guard the penitentiary here when a plot Slaughter had instigated for a wholesale delivery was uncov ered. On another occasion a con spiracy was alleged to have been dis covered which included the bribing by Slaughter of guards at the peni tentiary to permit his escape.

Other educators, he said, are looking to this congressional com mittee to adequately meet the needs of the city, and they are waiting for Its report in order to use it as a model for other cities. "There is a general feeling all over the country." Senator Capper said, "that the schools of the capital city are not what they should be, and there Is a general regret among these people that they are not. There is absolutely no question of the people giving their approval to anything which the Congress might do for the District of Columbia along the lines of providing for the very best school system, with all the necessary facil ities." Senator Capper laid before the com mittee the recommendations of Secre tary Davis of the Department of Labor for a centralised high school here and the use of the present high school buildings for the grade classes.

OFFERS FIVE PLANS FOR SAVING WATER! (Continued from First Page.) saved the government more than j $1,000,000 " by refusing to buy large' lots early in the year when prices were high, by rejecting high-priced proposals and by maintaining a plan for short-term and open-market pur chases. On lines of efficiency, the public printer announced that the night Congressional Record force estab lished a new mark in printing and mailing the Record one Saturday night during the summer. A sixty four page Record was set up. plated, printed, wrapped for mailing and de livered to the city post office in four thours. The edition totaled 32,600 copies. Numerous efforts In assisting de partments in meeting emergencies are cited Id the report, which quotes officials of executive departments in their notes of commendations for the efficient emergency work performed at various times by the office. Owing primarily to decrease in the cost of paper and to certain econo-' mlea la operations in the office, it has been possible to make several reduc tions In the scale of charges. SI* Employes Propped. Five hundred and ten employes were eliminated from the pay rolls during the fiscal year, according to the report, i The average number on the rolls throughout the year was 4.225. as com pared with 4.7CS in the year preceding. Co-operation with the Federal Board for Vocational Education and with the Veterans' Bureau In affording an op portunity for war veterans to receive vocational training In the office Is noted In the report. 8ever*l veterans of the world war are now employed in the printing and foundry division, it Is stated, and are making excellent records at their chosen work. The office, according to the report, is ?specially proud of the fact that it has the lint emergency hospital equipped by any government establishment in Washington for the humane care of em ployes who may be Injured or suddenly become sick in the service. During the year ?.Ui cases were treated by the physicians in charge. On account of the overcrowded condition of the present smalt emergency room, an additional hospital room is being constructed espe cially for the treatment of woman em ployes. It will be equipped with every convenience of a hospital ward. Includ ing shower bath, and three additional beds for patients. . , An item of waste to which the re port calls attention is that of the "tremendous stock of publications, which is growing larger every year." and which "indicates that some of the agonelea of the government have Ceatly overreached themselves in or rs for printing."

IRELAND IS AMAZED BY DE VALERA'S ACT OPPOSING TREATY (Continued from First Page.) among the dail leaders will not af fect the plans for the opening of par liament. The agreement was made be tween the British government and plenipotentiaries representing the dail etreann, and it will be placed ! before the house of commons and the house of lords In the king's speech Then, after Prime Minister Lloyd George in the lower house and 1 .on] Birkenhead in the upper chamber have explained and supported the agreement, a brief adjournment will be taken to await the vote of the dail cireann, which meets the same day?next Wednesday. The sessions of the dail are consid ered here aa likely to be prolonged and lively, for It is composed of young men with strong views, which they are in the habit of expressing with force. The outcome seems at this distance Impossible to predict. Although there were reports before the signing of the truce last summer that dif ferences of opinion existed between Mr. De Valera and some of his chief supporters, such as Arthur Griffith, no such differences, if there were any, have ever been expressed in public, and opinion on how the rank and tile will vote is considered for the most part mere guesswork. I Maay Favsr Hejertloa. Mr. De Valera. however, will have j strong supporters for the rejection ] of the agreement and for the demand for an Irish republic from Austin! Slack, Charles Burgess. Desmond' Fitzgerald, Liam Mellower, Cuuniess Marklewicz and all the out-and-out | republicans, it is believed. Govern ment circles In London, however, re main convinced that Griffith, Michael Collins and their supporters will win the day, as it is felt that the moder ates will follow this group. Arthur Griffith is not a fluent talk er, and little is expected by support ers ?f the agreement from his speeches in the dail. Michael Collins, oil the oth?r hand, has the reputation of pos sessing a wonderful Influence with an audience with his ability to push home an argument and his ready wit. Much is looked for In government quarters through his support of the pact, as he is pointed to as one of the heroes of the revolution, with great influence with the young men. The nationalists throughout the south and west of Ireland, who were forced into comparative obscurity with the ascendancy of the Sinn Fein, are counted upon here to use all their influence for the acceptancy of the agreement. All Prluaera to Gala Freedom. The split in the dail cabinet will not interfere in the release of the prisoners in the Irish internment camps and other places of confine ment, to whom amnesty was extended by the king's proclamation, according to the Irish office. Those from the Baliykinler camp will be given their | liberty today and others of the in : terned men will likewise be set free | immediately. It is pointed out here I that many of these men are classed as extremists, but the cordial recep tion which the first of those released gave to the agreement has caused hope in the official world that the released men for the most part will prove supporters of Collins and Griffith. The Dally Mirror, in an editorial written before receipt of the De Valera message, refers to the rumors of his hostility, and expresses doubt as to whether he is able, in any event, to disturb the settlement. "It is no secret that his influence has greatly declined." says the newspaper, "while his telegram to the Pope was an almost fatal blunder, which is unfor I given." 1,600 PRISONERS FREED. Great Rejoicing' as Proclamation of Xing Is Carried Out. B.r the Associated Press. BELFAST, December 9.?The 1.600 interned men in the Baliykinler camp were released today under the am nesty proclamation, and left for their homes amid scenes of enthusiasm. Soldiers' songs were freely chorused at the railway station anil the car windows of the trains bearing away the released men were ablaze with the Sinn Fein tri-color. Diverse opinions were expressed among the men on the new turn of the Irish situation given by IZamonn De Valera's statement In opposition to the treaty. The republican leader had many supporters, some of whom had fought with him in the Dublin rebellion, who declared their Implicit confluence in him. while others ex pressed themselves strongly for the agreement. In Belfast an opinion widely ex pressed is that the liberation of the interned men at this Juncture will react unfavorably on the treaty's chances. FOUR-POWER FUN DAISES H WIPES '? " '-I Success of Conference Be lieved to Hinge on Satis factory Agreement. BY JINKS B. WOOD. Chin* la the unknown quantity jn the proposed four-power agreement, which how is occupying the center place in the conference deliberation* However, so well satisfied are the representatives of the other powers that the present plans will materialize without a hitch and the conference brought to a speedy end that arrange ments are being mad* for the return to Europe. It was said last night that most of the British delegation, including Sir Arthur Balfour, expect to sail on the Adriatic on the 31st of this month. Though China, through ? expressed strong opinions on the four-power arrange ment at yesterday's meeting. it is hoped that her flnal decision will be that it is a safeguard for her and deserving of her approval, if not support. < hlaa D+?lre? f Be Member. J'lans for subsequent conferences which go as a corollary to the agree ment with the four powers are ex pected to indicate China that her interests will riot be infringed upon. The first of these, which has already been discussed, is a hoped-for confer ence on financial questions to be held The Hague. Under the schemi. this will be followed by other meet ing*, each for a particular subject, similar to the present discussion of naval armament and its relation to JJJ? far east. In those which concern China she will be given a voice, as ,n the present conference. Though the comprehensive scheme for the four-power combination to preserve the peace of the world and its subsequent series of conferences on international ills is viewed from a Utopian mountain height by its en thusiastic supporters, the Chinese delegation is not equally enthusi astic. They may be inclined to have apprehensions of the philanthropi< intentions of some of the parties to the agreement toward China and em phatically resent the formation ol" any such combination without China being the fifth member. Fall* to Get Support. That came up in the meeting of the nine-power committee yesterday through Dr. Koo, China's spokesman, but failed to receive the support of the other powers. China did not con tinue the argument against superior iiumbers, but more than one observer of the conference course has referred to the familiar proverb of "A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.** The Chinese delegation has refused to make anv public statement on the committee re jection of its claim for participation. However, its representatives have even more emphatically refused to express approval or gratification at the committee decision. Japan probably will be gratified with the four-power arrangement to such an extent that she may assent with out further argument to the fc-S-U naval program. While to Great {Britain the new line-up may mean little more than shelving the trouble [ some Anglo-Japanese alliance, to | Japan it is doubly superior to the old | alliance. Instead of an alliance of peace with one power, she has it with three. The danger of world isolation is still farther removed. (Copyright. 1K1.)
