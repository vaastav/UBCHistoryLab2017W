DEFABTMBXT. The Moretarv of war reports that the war department estimates fur the G*CM1 vear ending June 30. 1881, are $40,380,429 93, the aame being for a leaaanm of money than any annual estimate rendered to cougress from that department during a period of at leaat twelve years. lie concurs with the general of tbe anay in recommending such legislation aa will authorize tha en liniment of the full uuuiber of twenty-five thousand men for the line of the army, exclusive of the three ihouHand four hundred and sixty-three men required for detached duty, and therefore not availa ble for aervice in the field. He alao recommends that congress be ask ed to provide by law for the disposition ol a large number of abandoned military posts andreserrations, which, though very valua ble in themselves, have been rendered use less for military purposes by the advance of civilization and settlement. He unites with the quartermaster general in recommending that an appropriation be made for the construction of a cheap and perfectly fire-proof building for the safe storage of a vast amount of money accounts, vouchers, claims, and other valuable records now in the quartermaster general's office, and exposed to great risk of total destruction by fire. Healaa recommends, in conformity with the views of the judge advocate general,some declaratory legislation in reference to the military statute of limitations as applied to the orime of desertion. In these Beveral recommendations 1 con cur. The secretary of war further reports, that the work for the improvement of the South Pass of the Mississippi river, under contract with Mr. James B. Kidr, made in pnrxuance of an act of congress, has been prosecuted during the past year with a greater measure of success in the attainment of results than during any previous year. The channel through the Sonth Paw, which, at the be ginning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only seven and one-half feet of water, had, on the 8th of July, 1879, a min imum depth of twenty-six feet, having a width of not less than two hundred feet and a central depth of thirty feet. Payments have been made in accordance with the statute, as the work progressed, amounting in the aggregate to $4,250,000 and further payments will become due, as provided by the statute, in the event of success in main taining the channel no if secured. The reports of the general of the army and of his subordinates, pre sent a full and detailed account of the military operations for the sup pression of hostilities amon^ the Indians of the Ute and Apache tribes, and praise is justly awarded to the .officers and trcops en gaged, for promptness, skill and coursge displayed. The past year has been one of almost un broken peace and quiet on the Mexican frontier, and there is reason to believe that the efforts of this government and of Mexico to maintain order in that region, will prove permanently successful. This department was enabled during the past year to find temporary though crowded accommodations, and a safe depository for a portion of its records, in the completed east wing of the building designed for the state, war and navy departments. The construc tion of the north wing of the building, apart of the structure intended for the use of the war department, is being carried forward with all possible dispatch, and the work should receive from congress such liberal appropriations as will secure its speedy com pletion. THE 

NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the secretary of the navy shows continued improvement in that branch of the service during the last fiscal year.— Extensive repairs have been made upon ves sel*, aud two new tihips have been completed and made ready for sea. The total expenditures of the year ended June 30, 1879, including specific appropria tions not estimated for bv the department, were $13,555,710.09. The expenses charge able to the vear, after deducting the amount of these specific Impropriations, were' $13, 343,317 79 but this is subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants, but not paid out du ring the year The amount of appropria tions applicable to the last fiscal year was $14,538,040.17. There was,- therefore, a balance of $1,479,054 37 remaining unex pended, and to the credit of the department on June 30,1879. The estimates for the fis cal year ending June 30,1881, are $14,864, 147.95. which exceeds the appropriations for the present fiscal year $301,897.28. The reason for thia| increase is explained in the secreiary's report. The appropriations avail able for the present fiscal yisar are $14,502, 250.07, which will, in the opinion of the secretary, answer all the ordinary demands of the aervice. The amount drawn from the treasury from July 1 to November 1, 1879, was $5,770,504.12, of which $l,0d5, 440.33 has been refuuded, leaving as the ex penditure for that period $4,074,053.79. If the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds of the year do not exceed the proportion for these four months, there will remain unex pended, at the end of the year, $477,359.30 of the current 'appropriation*. The report of the secretary shows the 'gratifying fact that among all the disbursing officers of the pay corps of the navy there is not one who is a defaulter to tbo extent of of a single dol lar. I unite with bim In recommending the removsl of tbe nbservstory to more healthful location. That institution reflects credit upon the ostton, aud lias nbiained the approbation of acienllth. men 16 nil parts of the world. lis removal from Its present lncsllon would not only l« conducive to •he health of Its offlccra and professors, but Would greatly Increase its u»cfulnc«i DEPARTMENT or JL'STICK The appropriation lor judicial expenses, which has heretofore been made for tbo J0,Ue" gross, was sab divided st tha last session of oongreia, sad so appropriation whatever was made for tbe payment of tbe feus of marsha's and their deputies, either in Ibc service of pro Mas or forth* discbarge «l other delict and, since use 30, these ofHccrs have con tinued tin performance of their duties, with out compensation from the government, taking upon themselves ibe necessary in cidental oat lavs, as w«:i st rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable instances, bsa the proper execution of I he process or tbe Uulted States railed by rea son of tbe absence of the reqalslte appro priation. This course of oflicisl conduct on tbe part of thase.offlcers, highly credit able to tbeir fidelity, was advised by the attorney-general, who Informed them, how ever, tbat they would necessarily have to rely for tbeir compensation upon tha pros pact of ftitan legislation by cosgrtsi. I therefore especially recommend that Imme dlate appropriation bs made by congress for this purpose. Tbe act making the principal appropria tion for tbe department of justice at pre vious sessions bus uniformly contaiosd tbe following clause: "And far defraying the expensea which may be Incurred in tbe en forcement Ofttae act approved February 28, 1870, entitled 'An act to amend an act ap proved May 30. 1870, entitled 'An act to enfotca the right of citizens of tbe United States to vote ID the several states of the United Htstes, and for other purposes,' or any acta amendatory thereof or supplement ary thereto.'" No appropriation WM made for ibis pur pose for the current year. As no general election for members of congress occurred, tbe omission was a matter ot little practical importance. Such election will, however, take place during thvensning year, and tbe appropriation made for the pay of marshals and deputies should be sufficient to em brace compensation for tbo services they msv be re'quired to perform at sucb elec tions. Tbe business of tbe supreme court Is. at present, largel? in srresrs. It cannot be expected that more causes can be,decided than are now disposed of in its annual ses sion, or that by any assiduity tbe distinguished msgistrates who com pose tbe conrt can accomplish more than la. now done. In the courta of many of the circuits, also, the business has in creased to such an extent, that tbe delay of justice will csll the attention of congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed tbat all is done in each circuit which can fairly be expected from its judicial force. The evils arising from delay, are less heavily felt by the Unittd States, than by private suitors, as its causes are advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve tbe discussion of questions of a public char acter. The remedy suggested by the attorney general, is the appointment of additional circuit judges, and the creation of an inter mediate court of errors and appeals, which shall relieve the supreme court of a,part of its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance of circuit duties. I commend this suggestion to the consid eration of congress. It would seem to afford a complete remedy, and would in volve, if ten additional circuit judges are appointed, an expenditure, at the present rate of salaries, of not more than $00,000 a year, which would certainty be small in comparison with the objtcts to be at tained. THE 

POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT. The report of the postmaster-general bears testimony to the general revival of business throughout the country. The re ceiptsof the postoffice department for the fiscal year ended June 20,1879, were $ 041,982.80, being $740,405.91 more than the revenues of tbe preceding year. Tbe amount realized front tbe sale of postage stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards, was $7G4,405.91 more than in tbe preceding year, and $2,387,559.23 more than in 1877. The expenditure of the de partment were $33,449,899.45, of which the sum $370,401,04 was paid on liabilities in curred in preceding years. The expenditures during the year were $801,20977 less than in the preceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the operation of the law passed June 17, 1878, changing the compeniation of postmasters from a commission on the value of stamps sold, to a commission on stamps cancelled. The amount drawn from the treasury on appropriations in addition.to the renenues of the department was $3,031,454.95, being $2,270,197.80 less than the preceding year. The expenditures for the fiscal year end ing June 30, 1881, are estimated at $39, 920,900, and the receipts from all sources at $32,210,000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for, out of the treasury, of $7,710,000. The relations of the department with railroad companies have been harmonized, notwithstanding the general reduction by congress of their compensation, by the ap propriation for special facilities, and the railway post office lines have been great ly extended, especially in the southern states. The interests of the railway-mail service and of the public would be greatly promoted, and the expenditures could be more readily controlled by the classification of the employeesof the railway-mail service as recommehded'by the postmaster genera], the appropriation for1 salaries, with respect to which the maximum limit is alreddy fixed by law, to be made in gross. The "postmaster general recommends an amendment of the law regulating the in crease ot compensation for increased service and increased speed on star routes, so as to enable him to advertise for proposals for auch increased service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to the commerce of the country from the enact ment of a general law authorizing contracts with American built steamers, carrying the American flag, for transporting the mail between ports pf the United Btatcs and ports of tbe West Indies and South America, at a fixed maximum price per mile, the amount to be expended being regulaUd by annual appropriations, in like manner irlth the amount paid for the domestic Star service. Tbe arrangement made by the postmaster general and the secretary of the treasury for tbe collection of duty upon books re ceived in the mail from foreign countries, has proved so satisfactory in its practical operation thattke recommendation is now marie, tbat congress shall extend the pro vision* of the act of March 3, M79, under which this arrangement waa mad*, ao as to apply to all other dutiable articles received the mails from foreign countries. OUR 

INDIANS. The reports of the secretary of the inte rior and of the commissioner of Indian affairs, setting forth the present'atate of our relations with the Indian tribes on our ter ritory, the measure* taken to advance tbeir civilization and prosperity, and^ the prog ress already achieved bv them, will be found ol more than ordinary interest. The gen cral conduct of our Indian population has been so satisfactory tbat the occurrence of two disturbances, which rvsoltsd in blood' ab*4 and destruetioa of property, I* all the mors to be laaMotad. The history of tbe outbreak on the White River Ute Maervation ia western Colorado has become so (miliar by la borate MOM* in Ibe public press, tbat its remarkableia cidenta need not be seated here in detail. It is expected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to auch arrangements aa will prevent further boetile contact between tbe Indians and tbe border settlements ia Western Colorado. The other disturbance occurred at tbe Meeealero agency, in New Mexico, where where Victoria, the head of a smalt band of marauders, after comm'ttlng many atrocities, being vigor ously cbesed by a military force, nade ale way across the Mexican border and I* now on foreign anil. While these occurrences, In which a com paratively kmall number of Indiana were en gaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority or our Indian population have fully justified the expectation of those who believe tbat by human* and peaceful Influences tbe Indi an can be led to abandon tbe habita of sav age life and to develop a capacity for useful and civilized occupations. What tbey have already accomplished in tbe purauit of agri cultural and mechanical work, the remarka ble success which baa attended tbe esperi mcnt of employing aa. freighters a claaa of Indians hitherto counted among tbe wildest ana most Intractable, and tbe general and urgent desire expressed by tbem for tbeed ucstion of their children, may be taken as sufficient proof tbat tbev will be found capa ble of accomplishing much more if they coniinuo to be wisely and fairly guided. The "Indian policy" sketched in tbe report of Ibe secretary of tbe .interior, tbe object of which is to mske liberal provisions for the education of Indian youth, to settle tbe Iodisns upon farm lots, in severalty, to rive tbem title in fee to their farms, inalienable for a certain number of years, and when tbeir wants are thus provided for, to dispose by sale of tbe lauds on their reservations not occupied and used by tbem, a fund formed out of the proceeda for the benefit of the Indians, wbicb will gradually relieve tbe government of tbe expensea now pravi ded for by aunual appropriations, must com' mend itself as just aod benificial to tbe In dians, and as also calculated to remove those obstructions which the existence of large reservations presents to the settlement and development of the country. I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enabliog tbe government to give Iodisns title in fee, inalienable for twenty fire years, to tbe farm lands assigned to tbem by allotment. I also repeat tbe recommenda tion made in my first annual message, tbat a law be passed admitting Indiana who can give satisfactory proof or having, by tbeir own labora, supported tbeir ramtlies for number of years, and who are willing to de tach themselves from tbeir tribal relations, to tbe benefit of tbe homestead act, and to grant tbem patenta containing the ssme provision of Inalienability for a ceitain pe riod. The experiment ot sending a number of Indian children, of both sexes, to tbe Hamp ton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, to receive an elementarv English education and practical instruction in farm ing and other useful industries, has led to results so promising, tbat it Was thought ex psdient to turn over tbe cavalry barracka at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the interior department for the establishment of an In dian school on a larger scale. This school has now one hundred and fifty-eight pupils, selected from various tribes, and is in full operation. Arrangements are also made for tbe education of a number of Indian boys and girls belonging to tbe tribes on the Pacific slope, in a similar manner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institutions will commend themselves to the liberalit. of congress, snd to the philanthropic mu nificenceof the American people. Last spring, information was received of the orgsnization of an extensive movement in the western states, the object of which was the occupation by unauthorized persons of certain lands in the Indian Territory cedeft by the Chcrokees to the government for the purpose of settlement by other In dian tribes. On the 29ih of April, I issued a procla mation warning all persons against partici pation in such an attempt, and, by the co operation of a military force, the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect the rights ot the Indian inhabit ants of that territory to the full extent of the executive power. But it would be un wise to ignore the feet that a territory so large and so fertile, with a population so sparse and with so great a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to tbe repetition of such attempts as happened this vear, when the surrounding states are more densely settled, and the westward movement of our population looksstill more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under such circumstances tbe difficulty of main taining the Indian territory in its present state will greatly increase, snd the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to pre pare for auch a contingency. I, therefore, fully approve of the advice given to them by the secretary of the interior on a recent occasion, to divide themselves in severally large a quantity of their lands as tbey can cultivate, to acquire individual title in fee, instead of their present tribal ownerahip in common, and to consider in what man ner the balance of their lands may be dis used of by the government for their benefit., adopting such a policy tbey would moife' certainly secure for themselves the valne of their possessions, and at the same time pro mote their progress in civilization and pros perity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate the pretent state of things in the territory. The question whether a change in the control of the Indian service should be made, was in theforty-fifth congress referred to a joint committee of both houses for inquiry and report. In my last annual me* sage I expressed the hope tbat the decisiob of tbat question, then inproipect, "woold ar rest further agitation of this subject, such agi tation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon tbe service as well as tbe Indiana themselves Since then, the committee having reported, the question bat been de cided in the negative by a vote in the bouse of representatives. For the reasons here stated, and in view of ibe fact that further uncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much-necded legislation, to weaken the discipline of the service, and to unsettle sal utary measures now in progress for be government and improvement of the Indl sns, I respectfully recommend tbat tbe de cision srrived at by congress at its last ses sion be permitted toatand. 

TIMBRR DEPREDATIONS. The efforts made by tbe department of tbe interior to arrest the depredations on tbe timber landa of the United Sutea have been continued, and have met with consid ersble success. A Isrge number of esses of trespass have been prosecuted In tbe courta of the United States others hsvo been set tied, the trespassers offering to make pay ment to the government for tbe value of the timber taken by them. The proceeda oftheee proeccutiona sod settlements turned Into tbe treasury, fsr exceed in amount tbe sums appropriated by eonciew for tbla par A more important result, however, •eMieista ssr aoch ca»e still occur, has been greatly re duced In extent, end it Is probable tbat if the present polity v%rtnt0s|jr part—d and aaBdent prevision to tbat end la made by congress, each tisnpsssas. it least those on a large scsle, can be entirely suppresaed, ex cept in tbe territories where timber for tbe daily requlremente of tha pnpul Uats it the/set that Ibe desUncUon of public for*«ts%y deHelslDs, elthongh under the preaent atate of tbo I wise obtained. I therefore eer..o*t!y invite the attention of eougieaa to tbe tecommen dation made by tbe secretary of the Interior, be «nacted enabling tbe govern ment to sell timber from tbe pabne'laada without conveying the fee, When- auch landa are principelly valuable for. tbe Umber thereon, sucb salea to be ao regulated aa to conform to domestic wanta and boslntsa re quirements.* while st ibe same ttnae goard ing against sweeping, destraction of tbe forests. Tbe enactment of such a law ap pears to become a mora pressing neceailty every day. AORICDLTOBB. My recommendationa in former meesagts are renewed in favor of enlarging tha Csctli tiea of tbe department of agriculture. Agri culture is the lading inteifcaVMnd ibe per* maoent^ industry of uur people. It ta-t* tbe abundance of agricultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and tbe iargeljr IucreaMd and highly profitable market abroad which'we have enjoyed in re cent years, tbat we are mainly indebted for .our preaent proa perity as a people. We must look for Its continued maintenance to thefsame sub stantial resource. There Is no Uranen of indns try in which labor, directed by scientific knowl edge. yields sucb Increased prodaction In com parison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to which the encouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropri ately extended. Tbe omission to .render such aid is not a wise econoniy but, on the contrary, uudoubtly results In losses of Immense sums annually that might be saved through well-di­ rected eltorta by the Government to promote vital interest. Tbe results already accomplished with the very limited meana heretofore placed at the command of the Uepartinent of Agriculture is aa earnest of what may be expected witb in creased appropriations for the several purposes indicated in the report of the Commissioner, with a view to placing the Uepartinent upon a footing which wilt enable it to prosecute more etlectlveiy tbe objects for which it is establish ed. Appropriations ae needed for a more com plete laboratory,for the establishment of veter inary division of forestry, and for an increase of force. The requirements for these and other purpos es, indicated in tbe report of the commissioner under Hie bead of the immediate necessities of the department, will not involve any expendi ture of money that the country cannot with propriety now undertake in tbe iuterests ot ag riculture.
