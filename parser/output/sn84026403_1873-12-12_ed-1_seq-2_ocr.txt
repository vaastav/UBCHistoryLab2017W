wnbnvjj American. I. MASSER, WILVERT. Editor!. SUNBURY, DECEMBER 12, 1873. . ... I. !... JLi L'.l J t Hon. J. B. Tacker. We notice in the proceedings of Congress, that ftt its organi zation Speaker Blaine, has assigned the chairmanship of the committee of Tost Offices and Tost lloads to the Hon. John M. Packer, from this Congressional district. This is a deserved compliment both to Mr. . Packer and" his constituents, and shows the high estimation placed upon his ability and staudiug in Congress. This committee is one of the most important in tho House, and Mr. Packer's position Is perhaps one of the most distinguished and honorable that has ever been conferred upon tho con stituency of this district. Sir. Pucker's course, while in Congress, has bpen not only honorable, aud independent, but hifcbly sallsfacl6ry 10 his constituents, and we me happy to see that our leading statesmen look upon him as one of our rising men, and arc ready to exalt him to still higher honors, showing that they have full confidence in his integrity of character nutl his ability as a statesman. Tiie Fress and tiik Constitution. The Pliiladeclphia Press of Saturday last publishes a list of newspapers in the stale for and against the new Constitution. The Jilt is not complete, and omits among others two papers in this county. This list foots up 210 in favor, and eighteen agaiust the new . Constitution. Of this number in opposition . six are in Philadelphia, and two in Pitts burg. This is conclusive cvidenco that the new Constitution will be supported by at least three-fourth of the intelligent portion of the voters of Pennsylvania. Wo occa sionally find intelligent citizens of good tanding who give plausible, and sometimes ADgonious excuses for their opposition to tho . new Constitution. But a little rcl'ection nnd examination invariably reveals the fact, that in most of these cases such individuals have an "axe. to grind," which can't be sharpen ed on the new Constitution. A number of useless offices have been abolished, sala ries in chape of feci reduced, stealings pre vented find other restrictions made, all of which opera to against certain aspirants for office. These men will of course oppose the new Consitution, nnd these are the in dividuals who get up tho stories about the taxes on real estate, tho invasion of the secrecy of the Fallot and other inventions.

A. Shissler, Esq., has been prominently named for the posi tion of government printer at Washington. As no Pennsylvania!! has ever filled that position, wo hope that the claim of our State) will be recognized in this instance. Mr. Shissler is thoroughly practical as a printer, and has all other necessary qualifi cations for that responsible position in fact we know of none who could better fill it than Mr. Shissler. Kuowiu j the gen tleman ps wo have for many years, we do not hesitato iu saying that tho office, iu caso of his election, will be filled by an ho- norablo and upright official, whose kind and courteous disposition will secure har mony in that extensive establishment be . tween employer and employee, a matter ' heretofore unkuowu. Being thoroughly acquainted with the busiuess, understand ing all its branches, and being known throughout tho Stale as an able aud influ ential man, Pennsylvania will look upon his appointment as well deserved. Postmaster Geneual Cuesswell is getting into bad odor with the country ed itors, and tho people generally, foe recom mending to Congress to require publishers to prepny the postage on all newspapers sent out. Tho city publishers have foriu ' ed a "ring" to crush out country news papers, and through the power of this riug the provision compelling the people to pay postage on county new spapers was enacted last winter. . It looks as if Mr. Cresswell was laboring to do the dirty work for the "ring" this w inter. He will find it an un popular move before he gets through with it, aii J the city publishers will learn that the people iu the country will withdraw their patronage from their establishments before they will allow their county papers to be crushed out. Tweed enrolled himself, at the peniten tnry, as a "statesman" by occupation. He was sot cure about his religion. His parents were Prol99tunts, but tie had no religion he know cf. A to his occupation, however, he was confident : he was a "statesman" a Democratic "statesman." Had he not been elected to the Senate by his Democratic followers t His chief busi uess "was to steal ; but he was a Senator, all the whU, and therefore a "statesman." Tub Times Improving. From every part of tho country comes the gratifying intelligence that mauy of the industrial es tablishments compelled to cc.af.fl operations when the panic was at its height, are' re suming work. Some of them on half time and some at less time, with the expectation to gradually augment their capacities for production until the old standard is reach ed again. Tub Democrat's Statement or the County's Financial CoNDixioN. The figures presented by our neighbor of the l)cmor.rat last week, divulge a secret, we confess, with which' wo were heretofore un acquainted, nnd which looks as though there was more 'irregularity" than we supposed. . In trying to swell the indebted ness of the county, January 1, 18G3, he in forms us of the important fact that back standing State taxes, and balance due Treasurer to the amount of $14,332 25, were omitted In the "Statement of Finan ces" in that yesr. And in 180'J baekstanrt Ing State taxes amounting to $5,073 73 were omitted in the "statement of finan ces." At this late day, he now makes out that iu-1808 tho county was in debt 8 19, 808 17, whilo tho auditors of that same year say the indebtedness was but 834,750 02, and recorded it so in the auditors' re port. This renders ic a question of vera city now between the auditors of that year aud the editor or his calculator. If the calculator is correct the auditors must have been negligent of their duly, aud if the au ditors are right Ihon it looks as though somebody hud been a little "irregular" to the amount of $19,405 08 in those two years. Our neighbor carefully avoids giv ing a correct statement as to the assets, and adopts figures to suit his own purpose. Any ono will understand that assests is the amount the county realizes from tax ation, and other sources of revenue that are paid into the Treasury, which were ex plicitly given within a few weeks past in the American. But with all the omissions and incorrect statements by tho Calcula tor for the editor, we ore happy to sec that ho docs tho party justice in concluding his 8tntemcnt by staling that there is a great improvement siute the Republicans have had something to do with lite management of the county affairs. We give below his own exhibit which corroborates our for mer statements, viz : Debt of Jan. 1, 1808 S49.808 17 Debt of Jan. 1, 1(5 73 S0,7uU 87 Debt diminished from January 1, 18tiS to Jan. 1873, five, years J-'y.OOS 30 To this he might have truthfully added that since the Republicans have had the controling power during the past year, tho entire indebtedness has lecu paid off, and tho county is freo of debt. The calculator luriuei ndJg Indebtedness above assets Jan. 1, 1HI13 t:;0,2l7 37 Assets hiovc Indebtedness Jan. 1, 1873 C4.474 20 Improvement In tho financial affairs of the county iu flvo years $01,091 03 We cannot vouch for tho correctness of the above figures, but they show by his own admission that matters have greatly improved under Republican management. He states that a bounty order was issued in 18G2 of 725 00 which we notice he car ries along in his array of figures. We learn that no such order was iu existence, and it is doubtful whether it was ever is sued. But we confess it is a good plan to i cover up that amount of money. If our J neighbor is desirous cf giving the public a I correct statement we would ask him to j give an exhibit of the county fmauces j since 1SU4, so that tho public may be able j to sec o, coutrast between Republican "Rill"0"1 a"U tho I)umocratic In the November number of tho Prooj Sheet, a periodical published by Messrs j Collins and M'Leester, typo founders of.

We feel grateful to the writer for the very Haltering sketch given of the "American" which we copy below : "The Sunm.'KY American is published weekly by Em'l Wilvert. In 1S10, there was a split iu the Democratic party of Northumberland county, on the nomina tion for Assembly. The delegates in the convention nominated Jesso C. Horton, while the scccders nomiuated C. W. llegins. The American was started to support the claims of the latter gcutlemau, tho first number appeariug ubout tcu days after his nomination. The publishers were Harry B. Masscr and Joseph hisely. 1 his paper, though failing to secure tho election of Mr. llegins, was conducted with more than usual eucigy and ability, and soon obtained a good standing iu tho community. Mr. Eisely withdrew iu lKltf, aud Mr. Masser remained sole proprietor uutil 1604, when lie took into partnership Eni'l Wilvert, who had learned tho priming business in tho American office. Subsequently, X. S. Engle was also a partner lot about a year. In 1809, Mr. Masscr withdrew, and Mr. Wilvert has 6ince continued the publication ot' the paper ; the name of tho former gen tlemau, however, still appears as senior editor. Iu the presidential campain of 1800, the American, which had warmly support ed the claims of Douglas, seeing no chance of his clectiou, gave its support to Lincoln, and has since remained iu the Republican fold.

Moreover, there is no climate to which it has not proved it self to be well adapted for the cure of con siderable variety of diseases 5 it is admir ably BHilcd for every raco. It has lost nono of its good name by repealed trials, but conliuues to occupy a prominent position in every medicine chest 5 and is still re ceiving the most unqualified testimonials to its virtues, from persons of the highest character and responsibility. Physicians of the first respectability recommend it as (V most effectual preparation for the extinc tion of pain. It is uotouly tho besticmedy over known for Bruises. Cuts, Burns, &c, but for Dysentary or Cholera, or any sort of bowel complaint, it is a remedy unsur passed for efficiency nnd rapidity of action. In tho great cities of India and other hot climates, it has become the Standard Medi cino for all such complaints, as well ns for Dyspepsia, Liver Complaints, and other kind red disorders, For Coughs nnd Colds, Canker, Asthma, and Rheumatic difficul ties, it has been proved by the most abun dant and convincing testimony to bo an invaluable medicine. No article ever at tained such unbounded popularity. As an external nnd internal medicianc, the Pain Killer stands unrivalled. Thirty Years aro certainly a long enough time to prove the efficiency of any liiediciue, and that tho Pain-Killer is deserving of all its proved by the uuparalelled popularity it has attained. It is a suro and effective remedy. It is sold iu almost every country in tho world, and more popular every year.
