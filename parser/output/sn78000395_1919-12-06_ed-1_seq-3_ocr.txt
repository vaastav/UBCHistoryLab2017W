In the campaign to prevent unde­ sirable persons of foreign birth from becoming citizens of the United States, Joel Lichten, secretary of the local Painters' union, and one of the least offensive men we have- ever known, is the first victim. He was denied citizenship in Judge Morris' court last Friday morning after ad­ mitting that he had voted in favor of the resolution of sympathy for Soviet Russia at the New Ulm con­ vention of the Minnesola State Federation of Labor. Beyond the trade union movebent Mr. Lichten and The Labor World have little in common. We widely differ with him on many subjects Perhaps if we had suffered under the yoke of oppression as he has done we would entertain his views on political and industrial questions, and we doubt if we would be as mild, patient and considerate as he is. In speech he is without passion or ma­ levolence. In manner he is gentle and kind. In thought he is tolerant and considerate. These are not usual characteristics of dangerous enemiea to our country or its institutions. It would have been better had the fed­ eral authorities chosen a more glar­ ing subject for the denial of citizen­ ship. Loyal During War. During the war, Mr. Lichten loy­ ally supported the United States. He introduced a motion in his local union for the purchase of $500 worth of Liberty bonds. He also presented a resolution directing the treasurer to buy quantities of War Savings cer­ tificates and Thrift stamps to be sold to the members. He personally pur­ chased Liberty bonds of every issue and still possesses them. He regis­ tered under the draft and did not claim exemption as an alien, but asked only for such classification as was given to marri'ed men. He sup­ ported President Wilson and was zealous in his defense of America's stand in the war as defined in the fourteen points. Throughout the war he was loyal, not disloyal. He made no boast of patriotism, but he nendered patriotic service to the country. Classed as a radical be­ cause of his views on political and economic questions, but usually con­ servative in action and always prac­ tical his only crime is that he has zealously labored to improve the condition of his fellow workers and all the people. Exiled From Russia. Joel Lichten was born in Zdunskawola, Poland in Russia on July 3, 1886. As a youngster he be­ came affiliated with the Polish Socialist party, the dominating demo­ cratic political organization in Poland, which was foremost in the fight for the political independence of that country. Because of his activity in behalf of political independence, the Czar's government had him posted, and to avoid exile to Siberia, he escaped from the country into Den­ mark and from there to Sweden. In Sweden Mr. Lichten identified himself with the trades union move­ ment and took an active part in its operations. He worked as a painter and traveled considerably over Eu­ rope, where he learned to speak six different languages. In January, 1914, he came to the United States and settled in Duluth. Having a transfer card from the Painters union of Stockholm, he became a member of the Painters' union of Duluth, in which organization he has since taken an active part, serving it as secretary, as delegate to the Federated Trades Assembly of Duluth, and to conven­ tions of the Minnesota State Federa­ tion of Labor. He also became a mem­ ber of the Socialist party in America, but withdrew therefrom when the so called left wing came into control. 

SATURDAY- •THE LABOR WORLD -DECEMBER 6,1919. Declared His Intention. Mr. Lichten declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States in June, 1916, and made final application for fun citizenship In April, 1919. Since his arrival in the United States he has been a law abid­ ing citizen. He is not a member of the I. W. W., or any other political, industrial or social organization com­ mitted to the overthrow of the United States government. He at all times has strongly advocated changes in government by evolutionary processes through political action and Jie has opposed revolutionary changed, and particularly by so-called direct action. He has made it a point to identify himself only with" law abiding and lawful organizations of men and women. The Soviet Resolution. At the convention of tne Minnesota State Federation of Labor, held at New Ulm in July, a resolution having reference to the Russian situation was introduced and acted upon at the second day's session. This resolu tion read as follows: "Resolved, that the Minnesota State Federation of Labor hereby express its sympathy with the Soviet Russia, denounce the Allied efforts at subjec­ tion and their erection and support of the Mannerheim and Kolchalc gov ernments and the worldwide campaign of lying propaganda directed at the Russian Soviet government, and de mand immediate withdrawal from all Russian territory of Allied troops, the cessation of support to the Manner I heim and the Kolchak and other re actionary government." The committee on resolutions, to which the Russian Soviet resolution was referred, recommended the fol­ lowing substitute for the original resolution: "Resolved, that this ^convention favors the recognition of a truly I democratic form of government in AT THE ORPHEUM 4 N .?"• CARMEN ERCELLE AT ORPHEUM The latest musical comedy act will head the show at the Orpheum for the coming week, starting Sunday after­ noon.

Russia, when it shall have been estab­ lished through a constituent or other form of national assembly, represent­ ing the majority of the people through popular elections, and not until then.*' Defined Sovictisxn. Mr. Lichten voted in favor of, and talked in favor of the original resolu­ tion, in which he made no reference to Bolshevism or extended any sym­ pathy to the Bolsheviki, but in which he defended the principal of Soviet ism in Russia as he understood it. He declared that the Soviet system of government was peculiarly Russian and had existed from the time of Peter the Great. About the only change between the gyesent Soviet government and the Old Soviet he held, was in the fact that the fran­ chise was now limited to those per­ forming useful and necessary labor to society. Now, when Mr. Lichten's applica­ tion for citizenship was up for con­ sideration, he was questioned by R. K. Doe, representing the U. S. Depart­ ment of Labor. Mr. Lichten's wit­ nesses were John E. Jensen, a fellow painter and president of the Federated Trades Assembly of Duluth, and W. E. Towne, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council. Mr. Jensen is known as a conservative among labor men and the people of Duluth generally, and Mr. Towne is classed as a radical. When Mr. Lichten ap­ peared before Mr. Doe he was ques­ tioned substantially as follows: Put on tbe "Pan*' Q. Are you a Socialist? A. Yes, by conviction. Q. Did you vote for the Bolshevist resolution at the State Federation of Labor Convention, held at New Ulm, July, 1919? A. Not for the Bolshevist resolu­ tion, but for the resolution requesting the withdrawal of troops from Rus­ sia and expressing isympathy with Soviet Russia. Q. Did you attend the Mooney convention held at Chicago, 111., Jan­ uary 14-18, 1919? A. Yes, I attended as a duly elected delegate from the Federated Trades Assembly of Duluth. strike resolution? A. Yes, I did. Q. Did you recommend the en­ dorsement of the resolution to the Federated Trades Assembly upon your return from the convention? A. In my report to the Federated Trades Assembly I gave a full account of what transpired at the convention. There were no recommendations in the report. Q. Did you make a speech at the Court House Square on Labor Day, in which you stated that we should not have gone to Europe to fight for democracy when we have not democ­ racy at home? A. No, I did not. I only referred to, or I quoted President Wilson's message to Congress, in which he said that it was important to have more democracy in industry. Is Not an I. W. W. Q. Are you an I. W. W. A. No. I never was. Q. Do you approve of the actions of the I. W. W.? A. No, I have never approved of their actions. Q. Do you approve or Sabotage? A. No, I have always opposed Sabotage. On the morning of Friday, NoveiA •ber 28, Mr. Lichten appeared with his witnesses before- Hon. Page Morris, judge of the United States District Court at the Federal Building, Du­ luth, Minn., and the proceedings in his case were as follows: Mr. Doe presented to' the Court West Virginia Operators Ordered Union Committee Away When Notifying them. a copy of the Soviet resolution adopted by the New Ulm convention of the Minnesota State Federation of Labor, and stated that Mr. Lichten admits that he voted for the resolution and
