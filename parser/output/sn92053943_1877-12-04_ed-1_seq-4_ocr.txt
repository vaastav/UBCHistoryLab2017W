A correspondent of the New York Sun gives the following cure for stammering: 1.

Have confidence in yourself, and do not be embarrassed io the presence of Btrauttcrs. 3. Read some good poetical work, like Milton's Paradise Lost, or Pope's Homer's Iliad, slowly, taking caro to draw a full breath at the end of each second line. 4.

Tho conscience of old Mr. Tweed is probably the sublimest thing of me Bineieeniu century. Hayes' First Annual Message. We present to our readers, in to-day's issue, the President's message to Congress, which is quite lengthy and treats of several important national topics. ' The President very naturally opens up with a presentation of what he has done in regard to his so-called Southern policy, and felicitates himself that it has worked well, that the Southern States have peace, and that the industries of that section of the Country are being developed in a man ner truly encouraging. , As a further step in the development of this great ''conciliatory policy" he adds a few expressions of exalted, and paternal advice to "those to whom heretofore the "colored people have sustained the relation of bondmen," to legislate kindly in their behalf, and to avoid treating them in any manner which shall contravene their en joyment of every constitutional right; and expresses the belief, that this being done, the restoration of harmony will surely be attained and the bloody shirt be forever baried. His intention to use all his authority to this end he declares is very earnest, ad he invokes tbe cordial co-operation of everybody else, including the obdurate Republican Senators aud the potent host of Post-Masters, to assist him in his glori ous work. With the elimination of this political "Banquo" from the arena of na tional contention he feels assured "we "may safely hope to hand down our free "institutions of the government unimpaired "to the generations that will succeed us.'! Having pointed out the way in which the salvation of the Country may be effect ually attained, and the manner in which the dangers that have so omioiously threat ened tbe tranquility and prosperity of the Country under his immediate predecessor may be avoided, he passes from this transcendent topic to the consideration of such minor subjects, as Resumption, Remonetization of Silver, Civil Service reform, foreign relations, Indian affairs, and tho blessings of common school educa cation. In regard to resumption his views are positive and out spoken; "the policy of re "sumption should be pursued by every "suitable means and no legislation would "be wise that woulddisparage the import "ffDce or retard the attainment of that re sult." To alleviate the rugged hardship of such an apparently stern necessity as absolute resumption might prove, and to sotten the rigor ot such an ultra measure, he concedes that it might perhaps be well to remonetize fiiver to some extent, but not to make it an unlimited legal tender. He thinks that the use cf silver to some extent would probably afford material assistance to specie resumption. The great bondholding interests are comforted with the presidential opinion that the National debt was contracted to be paid in sold and not in silver. V hat particular comfort the debtor classes can derive from the President's views are not so easily eeeD, especially when we note his recom mendation to increase the tax on tea and coffee, articles which this country does not produce, and a reduction of tax upon such things as the country does produce. The Presidents remarks upon the sub iect of education are all well enough in their way, and of no special consequence as a matter of national concern. Tbe topic itself has been talked about, essayed, reviewed and expounded, until it is trite and common place even to barrenness. If virtue, honesty, morality, and integrity in the administration of public affairs, kept even pace with the efforts made for the general diffusion of common school educa tion, the ordinary annual cackle and clamor set up in its beha.f would present more interesting features, and have much greater claims upon public attention than is now the case. So much of the message as pertains to the Presidents "Southern policy" will probably receive a fuller and heartier en dorsement from those who voted against him for President, than from the majority of his party. His views upon the financial questions of the day are neither new, nor presented in any striking mammer, and the division of public sentiment, irrespective of party which prevails throughout the country upon that Bubjcct, will not be likely to be materially influenced or affected by anything the message affords. As to the foreign policy of the country, there is very little doubt the President will be warmly sustained by the great mass of tbe people in any line of action which vindicates the national honor, or affords national protec tion and security. The use of tho army and navy for the riurpoee ol repelling ag gressions of an eteuiy and compelling an honorable peace, is, and always will be, in accordance with patriotism and the spirit of the nation. Their use for the purpose of state police, and the upholding of false and spurious local governments, we sin cerely trust has forever passed away; and the recognition of this fact by the Presi dent we consider one of the wisest and best acts of his administration.
