x v A VYt T1 E President Roosevelt's annual message hag been delivered to congress. Open lng with a plea for the co-operatlou of all classes in continuing tho country's prosperity and . In correcting existing evils, for a "square deal" for every body, the message first takes up the Question of corporations and railroad rate legislation. The president says: Corporations. I am in no sense hostile to corpora tions. This is an ago of combination, and any effort to prevent all combina tion will be not only useless, but In the end vicious, because of the contempt for law which the failure to enforce law inevitably produces. The corpora tion has come to stay, Just as tho trades union has come to stay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long us It does good. But each should be sharply checked where it acts against law and justice. Experience' has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to get any ade quate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by state ac tion. Such regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction is coex tensive with the field work of the cor porationsthat is, by the national gov ernment. I believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the congress. If this proves impossible. It will certainly be necessary ultimately to' confer In fullest form such power upon the na tional government by affirmative ac ment of the constitution. Tho laws of the congress and of the several states hitherto, as passed upon by the courts, have resulted more often in showing that the states have no power In the matter than that the na tional government has power; so that there at present exists a very unfortu nate condition of things, under which these great corporations doing an In terstate business occupy the position of subjects . without a sovereign, neither any state government nor the national government having effective control over them. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in,' to assert the sovereignty of the na tional government by affirmative ac tion. 1 This is only in form an innovation. In substance it is merely a restoration, for from tho earliest time such regula tion of industrial activities has been recognized in the action of the law making bodies, and all that I propose la to meet the changed conditions in such manner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power it has always possessed, not only in this coun try, but also in England before and since this country became a separate nation. Railroad Rat Legislation. .As I said in my message of Dec. 0 "last, the immediate and most pressing ' need so far as legislation Is concerned 'is the enactment into law of some scheme to 6ecure to the agents of the "government such supervision and regu lation of the rates charged by the rail roads of the country engaged in inter state traffic as shall summarily and ef fectively prevent the imposition of un just or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a complete stop to re ' bates in every shape and form. This power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world, should be exercised with moderation, caution and self restraint, but it should exist, so that it can be 6ffectively exercised when the need arises. In my Judgment, the most important provision which such law should con tain is that conferring upon some com petent administrative body the power to decide upon tho case being brought before it whether a given rate pro scribed by a railroad 13 reasonable and Just, and if it is found to be unreason able and unjust then, after full investi gation of tho complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonly call- -this decision to go into effect with ""mable time and to obtain ard, subject to review " ftnt, not 

PRE1EII SMESSAG a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is Just as pernicious a3 a re bate in any other way. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common carriers. Only In this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of examination of railroad accounts 6houId be provided similar to that now conducted Into the national banks by the bank examiners. A few first class railroad accountants, If they had prop er direction and proper authority to In spect books and papers, could accom plish much in preventing willful viola tions of the law. Employers' Liability Law. In my annual message to tho Fifty eighth congress at Its second session I recommended the passage of an em ployers' liability law for the District of Columbia and in our navy yards. I re newed that recommendation in my fucssage to the Fifty-eighth congress at its second session and "further suggest ed the appointment of a commission to make a comprehensive study of em ployers' liability with a view to the en actment of a wise . and constitutional law covering the subject, applicable to all industries within the scope of the federal power. I hope that such a law will be prepared and enacted as speed ily as possible. There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue Injunctions in labor disputes. Such special limita tion of the equity powers of our courts would bo most unwise. It is true that some Judges have misused this power, but this docs not Justify a denial of the power any more than an improper ex ercise of the power to call a strike by a labor loader would Justify tho denial of the right to strike. The remedy Is to regulate the procedure by requiring the Judge to give duo notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing to be ex parte If the adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered. What is duo notice must depend upon the facts of the case. It should not be used as a pretext to per mit violation of law or the Jeopardiz ing of life or property. . Of course thi3 would not authorize the issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case In which it is not already author ized by existing law. I renew the recommendation I made In my last annual message for an in vestigation by the department of com merce and labor of general labor condi tions, especial attention to bo paid to the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation in the several states. Such an investigation should take into account the various problems with which tho question of child labor is connected. In such a republic as ours the one thing that we cannot afford to neglect Is the problem of turning out decent citizens. The future of the na tion depends upon the citizenship of the generations to come. The children of today are those who tomorrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we cannot afford to neglect them. The leg islature of Colorado has recommended that the national government provide some general measure for the protec tion from abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United States I lay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable consider ation. As to .Women Who Work. The department of commerce and la bor should also make a thorough Inves tigation of the conditions of women In industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo men are now engaged in gainful occu pations, yet there i3 an almost complete dearth of data upon which to base any trustworthy conclusions as regards a subject as important as it is vast and complicated. The introduction of wo men into Industry is working change and disturbance in tho domestic and social life of tho nation. The decrease in marriage, and especially in tho birth rate, has been coincident with it. "We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustment to factory conditions must be made, but surely it can be made with less frlotion and less harmful ef fects on family life than is now the case. This whole . matter in reality forms one of the greatest sociological phenomena of our time. It is a social question of the first importance, of far greater importance than any merely po litical or economic question can be. In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employee inter ested,, but also, a third party the gen t nubile". Every considerable labor "'ich Interstate commerce the growth of a spirit which condemns all dishonesty, whether In rich man or In poor man, whether it takes the shape of, bribery or of blackmail. But much can bo done by legislation which is not only drastic, but practical. There Is need -of a far stricter and more uni form regulation of the vast insurance Interests of this country. The United States should in this respect follow the policy of other nations by providing adequate national supervision of com mercial Interests which are clearly na tional in character. I repeat my previous recommenda tion that the congress 6hould consider whether. the federal government has ny power or owes any duty with re spect to domestic transactions in in surance of an interstate character. That state supervision has proved in adequate is generally conceded. The Revenues. There is moro need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal per fection in tho methctls of raising rev enue, and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change In these methods ren der such change Inadvisable unless for grave reason. It Is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to de termine the moment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a change. No change can be made on lines beneficial to or desired by one section or one state only. There must be something like a general agree ment among tho citizens of the several states that the change is needed and desired in the Interest of the people as a whole, and there should then be a sin cere, Intelligent and disinterested ef fort to make It In such shape as will combine, so far as possible, the maxi mum of good to the people at large with the minimum of necessary disre gard for tho special Interests of locali ties or classes, but in time of peace the revenue must, on the average, taking a series of years together, equal the expenditures or else the revenues must be Increased. Last year there was a deficit. Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenues then our revenue laws must be readjusted. It is impossible to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for it is as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it. It should be considered whether It Is not desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying as against or in favor of any other nation maximum and minimum tariff rates established by the congress, so as to secure a certain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves. Economy In Expenditures. I earnestly recommend to the con gress the need of economy and, to this end, of a rigid scrutiny of appropria tions. All unnecessary offices should ho.abolishcd. Inthepubllc printing also a large saving of "money can be made. There is a constantly growing tendency to publish masses of unim portant Information at which no human being ever looks. Yet, in speaking of economy, I must Jn nowise be understood as advocating the false economy which Is in the end the worst extravagance. To cut down in tho navy would be a crime against tho nation. To fall to push forward all work on tho Tanama canal would be as great a folly. Cnrrency. Every consideration of prudence de mands the addition of tho element of elasticity to our currency system. The evil does not consist In an Inadequate volume of money, but In the rigidity of this volume, which does not rer.pond as it should to tho varying needs of communities and of seasons. Inflation must be avoided, but some provision should bo rnado that will Insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than In tho less ac tive seasons of the year, so that the currency will contract against specula tion and will expand for the needs of legitimate business. At present the treasury department Is at Irregularly recurring Intervals obliged In the inter est of tho business world that Is, In tho Interests of tho American public to try to avert financial crises by pro viding n remedy which should be pro vided by congressional action. nnstnes Methods In Departments. At various times I bavo instituted in vestigations into tho organization and conduct of tho business of tho execu tive departments. While none of these Inquiries have yet prorw'' enouf,', if wp All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any po litical purposo should bo forbidden by law, directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes, and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effectlvo method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts. The Ilnguo Conferenee. The first conference of nations held at The Hague in 1S00, being unabte to dispose of all the business before it, recommended the consideration and settlement of a number of Important questions by another conference to bo called subsequently and at an early date. Theso questions were the follow ing: (1) The rights and duties of neu trals; (2) the limitation of the armed forces on land and sea and of military budgets; (3) the use of new types and calibers of military and naval guns; (4) the inviolability of private property at sea in times of war; (5) the bombard ment of ports, cities and villages by na val forces. In October, 1904, at the In stance of the interparliamentary union, I issued invitations to all the powers signatory to The Hague convention to send delegates to such a conference find suggested that it be again held at The Hague. From all tho powers acceptance was received, coupled In some cases with the condition that we should wait until the end of the war then waging be tween Russia and Japan. The emperor of Russia, Immediately after the treaty of peace which so happily terminated this war, In a note presented to tho president on Sept. 13 took the Initiative in recommending that the conference be now called. The United States gov ernment in response expressed Its cor dial acquiescence and stated that It would ns a matter of course take part In the new conference and endeavor to further Its aims. We assume that all civilized governments will support tho movement and that the conference is now an assured fact. This government will do everything In its power to se cure the success of the conference to the end that substantial progress may be made in the cause of International peace, Justice and good will. Monroe Doctrine. There are certain essential points which must never bo forgotten as re gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first place, wo must ns a nation make it ev ident that we do not Intend to treat it in any. shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the ex pense of the republics to tho south. But we must make it evident that wo do not intend to permit the Monroe doc trine to be used by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect It from tho consequences of its own misdeeds against foreign nations. The Monroe doctrine does not force us to interfere to prevent tho punishment of a port save to see that the punishment does not assume the form of territorial occu pation In any shape. The case is more difficult when it refers to a contractual obligation. This country would cer tainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a Just debt. On the other hand, it Is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to take possession, e-en tempo rarily, of the custom houses of an American republic in order to enforce tho payment of its obligations, for such temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only es cape from these alternatives may at any time bo that wo must ourselves undertake to bring about some arrange ment by which so much as possible of a just obligation shall bo paid. To do so insures the defaulting re public from having to pay debts of an improper character under duress, while it also insures honest creditors of the republic from being passed by in the interest of dishonest oigrasping cred itors. Moreover, for the United States to take such a position offers the only possible way of insuring us against a clash with some foreign power. The position is therefore In the Interest of peace as well as in the interest of jus tice, j Snnto Domingo. Santo Domingo has now made an ap peal to us, and not only every principle of wisdom, but every generous Instinct within us, bids us respond to tho ap peal. The conditions in Santo Domingo have for a number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all society vas on the verge of dissolution. just at this time a ruler "nuto Domingo who, with aw the dangers thrcat y and appealed to the only neighbor who and the will to Imminent dan Ion. The pa had become 'oreign na Tvcntlon unoffi- that into ment Is terminated by the failure of the treaty chaos will follow, and sooner or later this government may bo In volved in serious difficulties with for eign governments over the Island or else may be forced itself to intervene In the island in some unpleasant fash Ion. Army and Navy. I do not believe that any army In tbe world has a better average of enlisted man or a better type of junior officer, but the army should be trained to act effectively in a mass. Provision should be made by sufficient appropriations for maneuvers of a practical kind. Provision should be made for tho pro motion of exceptionally meritorious men over the heads of their comrades and for the retirement of all men who have reached a given ago without get ting beyond a given rank. There should be an increase in the coast artillery force so that our coast fortifications can be in some degree adequately manned. There U special need for an Increase and reorganization of the medical department of the army. In both the army and navy there must be the same thorough training for duty in the staff corps as in the fighting line. The importance of this was shown con clusively lnthe Spanish-American and the Russo-Japanese wars. Tho work of the medical departments in tho Jap anese army and navy is especially worthy of study. Our navy must, relatively to tho na vies of other nations, always bo of greater size than our army. We have most wisely continued for a number of years to build up our navy, and it has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. This standard must not only bo maintained, but increased. It docs not seem to me necessary, how ever, that the navy should, at least in tho immediate future, bo increased be yond the present number of units. What is now clearly necessary Is to substitute efficient for inefficient unKs as the latter become worn out or as it becomes apparent that they are use less. Frobably the result would be attained by adding a single battleship to our navy each year, the superseded or outworn vessels being laid up or broken up ns they are thus replaced. Naturalisation. On this subject I recommend: First. A federal bureau of naturali zation, to be; established in the depart ment of commerce and labor, to su pervise the administration of the natu-! rallzatlon laws and to receive returns of naturalizations pending and accom plished. Second. Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to be charged, and procedure. Third. More exacting qualifications for citizenship. Fourth. The preliminary declaration of Intention to be abolished and no alien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing of his peti tion. Fifth. Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to be confined to United States district courts anJ to such state courts as have Jurisdiction in civil actions in which the amount In controversy is un limited; in cities of over 100,000 inhab itants tho United States district courts to have exclusive jurisdiction In the naturalization of the alien residents of such cities. Criminal Laws. In my last message I asked the at tention of the congress to the urgent need of action to make our criminal law more effective, and I most ear nestly request that you pay heed to tho report of the attorney general on this subject. f? There seems to bo no statute of tho United States which provides for the punishment of a United States attor ney or other officer of the government who corruptly ngrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain from doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement 13 other than ono possessing money value. This ought to be remedied by appropriate legislation. Legislation should also be enacted to cover explicitly, unequivocally and be yond question breach of trust In the shape of prematurely divulging official secrets by an officer or employee of tho United States and to provide a suitable penalty therefor. Merchant Marine. To the spread of our trade In peace and the defense of our flag in war a great and prosperous merchant marino is Indispensable. We should have ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets .and in case of need to re-enforce our battle line. It cannot but be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that tho lines of communication with our sister republics of South America should bo chiefly under foreign control. It Is not a good thing that American merchants and manufacturers should have to send their goods and letters to South Amer ica via Europe if they wish security and dispatch. Even on tho Taciflc, where our ships have held their own better' than on the Atlantic, our mer chant flag is now threatened through tho liberal aid bestowed by other gov ernments on their own steam lines. I sk your earnest consideration of tho oort with which the merchant ma "i commission has followed Its long careful Inquiry. is a matter of unmixed satlsfac mce more to call attention to tho ?nt work of the pension bureau, ? veterans of the civil war have ;er claim upon us than any other C our citizens. To them first of Og our people honor Is due. Immigration. id In my last message to tho ' we cannot have too much :n of the right sort, and wo vo none whatever of the 'ons arising in connection i immigration stand by The conditions in China the entire Chinese cooly class that is, tho class of Chinese la borers, skilled and unskilled legiti mately come under the head of unde sirable immigrants to this country. But in the effort to carry out the pol icy of excluding Chinese laborers, Chi nes coolies, grave injustice and wrong have been done by this nation to the people of China and therefore ultimate-, ly to this , nation itself. Chinese stu dents, business and professional men Of all kinds, not only merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro-i fessors, travelers and tho like, should be encouraged to come here and treat ed on precisely the same footing that we treat students, business men, trav elers and the like of other nations. As a people we have talked much of the open door in China, and we expect, and quite rightly intend- to insist upon. Justice being shown us by the Chinese. But we cannot expect to receive equity unless we do equity. 4 The Civil Service. neads of executive departments and members of the commission have, call ed my attention to the fact that the rule requlrhig a filing of charade and three days' notice before an employee could bo separated from the service for inefficiency has served no good pur pnaa whntever.. ExDcrlcnce has shown that the rule Is "whbliy Ineffective to save any man If a superior for im proper reasons wishes to remove him and Is mischievous-because It some times serves to keep in the service in competent men not guilty of specific wrongdoing. Having theso facts In view, the rule has been amended by. providing that where the Inefficiency or incapacity comes within the personal knowledge of the head of a department the removal may be made without no tice, tho reasons therefor being filed and made a record of the department. The absolute right of removal rests where it always has rested, with the head of a department. The change is merely one of procedure. It was much needed, and It Is producing good re sults. Our copyright laws need revision. Philippines and Other Islands. I During tho .last year tho rhilippine Islands have been slowly recovering from the series of disasters which since American occupation have greatly re duced the amount of agricultural prod ucts below what was produced In Span ish times. The agricultural conditions of the Is lands enforce more strongly than ever the argument In favor of reducing the tariff on the products of the Fhilipplne Islands entering the United States. I earnestly recommend that the tariff how imposed by the DIngley bill upon the products of the Fhilipplne Islands be entirely removed, . except the tariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be reduced to 25 per cent of the present rates under the DIngley act; that after July 1,-1909, the tariff upon tojbacco and sugar produced In the Philippine Islands be entirely removed and that free trade between the islands and the United States in the products M 1. A- ikA- 1. 1 .1 by law. In my Judgment, immediate steps should be taken for the fortification of Hawaii. This is the most Important point In tho Taclfic to fortify In order to conserve the Interests of this coun try. It would be hard to overstate the importance of this need. Hawaii Is too heavily taxed. Laws should be enact ed setting aside for a period of, say, twenty years 73 per cent of the Internal revenue and customs receipts from Ha waii as a special fund to be expended in the islands. I earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly confer American citizenship on all citizens of Porto Rico. I wish also to call the attention of the congress to one question which af fects our Insular possessions generally namely, the need of an increased lib erality In the treatment of the whole franchise question In theso Islands. I earnestly ask that Alaska be given an elective delegate. AdmlNftlon to Statehood. I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma bo admitted as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. The Panama Canal. Active work In canal construction, mainly preparatory, has been in prog ress for less than a year and a half. During that period two points about the canal have ceased to be open to debate. First, the question of route; second, the question of feasibility. The point which remains unsettled is wheth. er the canal shall be one of several locks above sea level or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay before the congress at an early day tho findings of the advisory board of American and European en gineers. In addition to sanitating the isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being provid ed for employees and an adequate sys tem of supplying them with wholesome food at reasonable prices has been cre ated. Hospitals have been established and equipped that are without superi ors of their kind anywhere. During the past year a large portion of the plant with which the work is to be done has been ordered. It is confident' ly believed that by the middle of the approaching year a sufficient propor tion of this plant will have been in stalled to enable us to resume the work of excavation on a large scale. Tin.,. I . .l . . .. .1 Aa. lay is an appropriation by the congress to meet tho current and accruing ex penses or ine commission. iuo nrsi appropriation of $10,000,000 out of the $133,000,000 authorized by tho Spoonct act was made three years ago. It la nearly exhausted. Unless tho congress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease. - In conclusion the president recom mends nn Increase in the diplomatic and consular service and more ad equnto compensation of its members.
