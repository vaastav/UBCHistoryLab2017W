CKrilmm Tuesday Morning, December 3, 1872. We publish this morning the Annual Report of the Comptroller of the Currency. It is an abler document than tho average of reports from that Bureau, and will undoubtedly be carefully studied by the bauking and commercial classes of the community. The aspect of tho local money market is some what more favorable. The increase in tho num ber of hogs, cattle, beef, etc., shipped Eastward within a week, has made an increase in the amount of New York exchange on the market. Bills of exchange are only another kind of cur rency, and their increase is equivalent to an in- crease of circulating money in this market. Secretary Boutwell tells us that the total re ceipts of the Government the last fiscal year were $374,106,867.56; the total expenses were $377,478,216.21; the reduction of the debt has been $99,960,253.54. Since March, 1869, the re duction of the debt has been $363,696,999.87, and the interest thus saved amounts to $24,187,- 851 annually., Our columns contain this morning the im portant intelligence that railway communication vas yesterday opened for the first time to the Iron Eegions of Lake Superior. The comple tion yesterday of the new steel rail route to Milwaukee over the Milwaukee & St. Paul is also announced. Both events are of great im portance to Chicago and the new country which is opened, and they deserve more notice than ear crowded space allows. The Society for the Suppression of Obscene Publications, in New York, lias done good work of late, —its practical achievements being chiefly due to a young dry goods clerk, who has de voted himself to the cause. Having succeeded in suppressing the most notorious publications of obscene literature, it is now proposed to make a crusade against the quack physicians and cheap druggists who advertise, by means of cir culars and pamphlets of the most revolting de scription, and whose professional character secure them a circulation where they can do most harm. The Imperial Eailway, from Yokohama to Yeddo, was formally opened on the X4th of last October, and was made tho occasion of National rejoicing. A correspondent of the Springfield (Mass.) Republican gives an account of tho cere monies, which were unusually interesting, from the fact that it was tho first time in the history of Japan that one of its monarchs had openly exhibited himself to his people. The two facts, first of the opening of a railroad, and second, of the exhibition of a sovereign whose forefathers were thought to be too sacred for vulgar eyes to look upon, shows a progress which is very re markable, and will create a very decided respect for the courage of the Mikado, who, with such precedents as he has had in his ancestors for centuries past, has ventured to set them all aside. The subscriptions for the relief of Harvard College, whose sources of income were virtually cut off by the Boston fire, had reached the sum of $102,190 on the 26th ult, Tho whole amount asked for by the College is about §250,000, which approximates to the amount lost in the fire. Without this aid, it is extremely doubtful whether the College would be able to continue operations, as it has no other sources of income which are avail able for educational purposes. In this connection, Professor Eliot, of Harvard, has published a communication in tho Boston Daily Advertiser , showing that in the year 1871-72 each of the 621 undergraduates cost the College about SIOO more than he paid, and that in the year 1870-71 each undergraduate cost about §95 more tb*" he paid, and in this statement no ac count is taken of tho value of lands, public buildings, libraries, and collections of the city. The Ration publishes a letter from a corre spondeni,—who asserts a personal knowledge of what he writes,—in which it is stated that the new Postmaster of Philadelphia is a personal fcieod Qi Senator Caaeron, ami the real choice of the latter for that office. It is claimed that the retiring Postmaster is the political friend of Mr. Cameron, and that the promotion of Mr. Fairman Mas an arranged matter with Mr. Cam eron. If this he true, it places Mr. Cameron in a position of even greater depravity than is gen erally assigned him. His visit with Hartranft and Stokoly and O’Neill to Washington, to de mand of the President the appointment of Mr. Truman Mas then a fraud, —a fraud upon his companions, a fraud upon the public, and a fraud upon the President, and yet it is consis tent Mith Simon Cameron’s whole public and private life. Stanley’s recent expedition to find Living stone has given a renewed interest to African ex ploration, and the expedition now fitting ont by the Berlin Geographical Society to explore* Cen tral Africa is attracting unusual attention in Europe. The German Society is acting upon the theory that there is an area in the middle of Africa, of about a million square miles, which has never yet been entered by any travellers, although Livingstone, Burton, Grant, Speke, Mungo Park, Barth, Du Chaillu, Dr. Schwein furth, and others have approached it on all sides. It is believed that it constitutes one and the same geographical province, with different flora and fauna from the rest of Africa, and inhabited by different people. The great obstacle to trav ellers hitherto has been the slave trade and the dangerous condition of the country to which it gives rise, which renders passports or arrange ments for safe conduct of no avail. The expedi tion of the German Society will be organized with reference to overcoming this obstacle, and if, as is stated, this region is rich in fruits, spices, and ivory, its opening up for commercial purposes will he a handsome reward for the la bors of the Society. Specie payments, according to Secretary Bout well, are to be reached, not by contraction, to ■which the country is averse, but by making our paper currency consist of United States notes and National Bank notes, and by a steady refusal to add to this currency until it is equal in value to coin. This last result is to follow from growth of trade caused by the increase of population, the multiplication of industries, the develop ment of the South, and the use of paper in Texas and the Pacific States. This ap proach of the business of the country to the volume of its currency may be accelerated if the Government will so encourage American ship ping that its annual earnings amount to 650,- 000,000, instead of the 630,000,000 which is now in our hands, and is but 2S}< per cent of the carrying trade that fills our harbors. In ad dition, Government should do something, which the Secretary docs not specify, to quicken inter nal transportation, and, lastly, it must continue to protect the iron, wool, and cotton industries, and discourage competing importations. In this way we shall reach the time when the Treasury will pay its demand notes in coin, and the banks meet their notes with coin or legal tender. The Chicago produce markets were generally dull yesterday. Mess pork was 15@25c lower ; at 613.00 for old, 612.00 for new, and 6X2.25(5) 12.37>£ for new seller March.

The receipts from Jan. 1 to Dec. 1 aggregate 2,739,509, against 1,923,252 for the corresponding period last year,—an increase of 816,257. There was no considerable demand for cattle, and prices were nominally unchanged. Sheep remain quiet and easy. The New York Times has distinguished itself by endeavoring to take a commercial advantage of Mr. Greeley’s death. The body of its obitu ary article did not consist so much of kind words for the deceased journalist, as of com ments upon the probable decadence of his news paper without him. Of Mr, Greeley himself, it was content to show that his death was prema ture ; that there was reason to believe that ho was insane during the whole canpaign; and that “he died of Liberal Eepnblicanism.” In another article on “Mr. Greeley’s Career,” it held that his great popularity and repu tation wero tho results of the intel lectual superiority which he exerted fif teen, or twenty, or twenty-five years ago* when American civilization was of a more primitive character. "While it is unpleasant to contemplate what Mr. Carlyle would call the “ nastiness ” of this treatment of Mr. Greeley’s death, it should not be overlooked, because it was the only thing necessary to illustrate tho greatness of the deceased editor of" tho New York Tribune , and tho comparative littleness of the present conductors of the New York Times. Mr. Greeley was not more the New York Tribune than Mr. Raymond was tho New York Times , Upon the death of the latter, neithertho Tribune nor any other paper predicted the decay and dis solution of tho Times. Yet that method of treating the decease of a brother journalist would have been as appropriate and decorous as the Times' unhappy and inopportune squealing at the open grave of Mr. Greeley. Throe great changes in our financial system, says the Secretary of the Treasury, grew out of the war. These were tho initiation of a broad system of Protection, through the imposition of heavy customs-duties; tho issue of paper money by the Government; and the National Bank system. These three measures, the Secretary confidently asserts, have won popular sup port, and will remain substantially undis turbed until tbe effects of tho war have disappeared, Por ten years tho weight of the debt has prevented any discussion of the principles of Pree Trade. During that period Protective policy has been in force, and the country has prospered. A reduction of customs duties may be expected, he says, but not such as to disturb this beneficent interdependence be tween tho Government and tho industry of the country. The principles of Political Economy, the Secretary evidently believes, differ widely in their range from all other principles, for they are only national, not cosmopolitan, as Mr. Boutwell perhaps thinks to be tho case with common sense and the multiplication table. Along dissertation follows in favor of Protec THE 

CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE: TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1872. ti°nj Mhich, to use the Secretary’s language, Me hope the weight of the debt Mill prevent the people from considering. The other two results of the war, the Govern ment issues of paper and the National Bank notes, the Secretary considers together. He opposes the discontinuance of the National Banks, as it would throw the $400,000,000 of bonds held by them on the market, would crip ple the banking business of the country, would deprive the Government of the aid of the banks, and would restrict exchanges be tween different sections of the country. The circulation of the banks is limited by law, and they are thereby prevented from responding to the increased demand for currency, at such times, for instance, as the movement of the crops of the West and South to the seaboard. Nor can the Treasury any longer ac cumulate reserves as in the days when its currency receipts were greater than its currency expenditures. To remove the legal restrictions on bank circulation, the Secre tary argues, would be the fatal mistake of al lowing the currency to bo inflated at the dictation of the pecuniary interests of the bank managers. The problem is to find an agency to increase the currency when it is needed to move fall pro duce, and contract it when this movement has been effected. Since the banks cannot be trusted with this delicate duty, to whom, he asks, would you confide it, if not to the Treasury? THE MAYOR’S MESSAGE. The annual message of Mayor Medill to the Common Council will be found in The Tribune this morning. It gives a resume of the year’s business, a year which the Mayor aptly describes as one of “ settlement, liquidation, retrenchment, and restoration." The bonded debt is $13,540,- 000, and the floating debt $1,895,400. This float ing debt consists of unpaid debts incurred be fore the fire, the taxes to pay which were re pealed & year ago. It also embodies $500,000 for rebates on special assessments made in former years. During the year 21 miles of water-pipes were laid, making an aggregate of 309 miles. Work on the new tunnel has boon begun, and there is, a'prospect of a speedy and sufficient supply of water. The Mayor advises the abandonment of the extension of Milwaukee avenue, and that tho condemned property be resold. He renews his special recommendations of pre cautions against fire by tho increase of the fire and police force, tho purchase of hose and fire extinguishers, and oth6r preventive measures. He claims that prevention of fires is tho best in surance, and calls attention to the fact that the average rate of insurance on property in this city exceeds the taxes levied on the same prop erty. Ho details the proceedings taken to diminish or abate the nuisances of the rendering estab lishments, and advisee their removal from tho city. Ho congratulates the Council on tho arrangements made with the railroads, whereby viaducts are to be maintained over all street-crossings, and generally congratulates tho city upon the com parative prosperity and success which the last year has witnessed, not only in the administra tion of tho Municipal Government, but in tho business, commerce, rebuilding, and general welfare of the city. THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. The tone of the President's Message is supe rior to that of any of his previous communica tions to Congress. There are certain recom mendations embodied in it in 'which wo cannot concur, and notably those relating to steamship subsidies and the postal telegraph scheme; but we are pleased to observe in the general drift and scope of the document a bettor comprehen sion of public affairs, and a more diligent appli cation to business than wo have heretofore no ticed in General Grant’s messages. The message begins with an appropriate allu sion to the Boston fire, and without further pre face it communicates to Congress the results of the Geneva Conference. The temporary inter ruption of the Conference by the claim for indirect damages, the President says, was solved “in a manner entirely satisfactory to this Gov ernment, and in accordance with the views and the policy which it had maintained.” The thanks of our Government have been expressed to the Governments which appointed the G-eneva Arbi trators, and also to the Arbitrators themselves. The President also highly commends the services of Mr. Charles Francis Adams, and states that the Queen of Great Britain has signified her appre ciation of the ability and industry displayed by that gentleman. The services of Mr, Bancroft, in presenting our case to the Emperor of Ger many in the matter of the San Juan award, are also highly commended. The President recom mends that Congress immediately pass the necessary laws to cany into effect the clauses of the treaty regarding the fisheries, —the most important of which is that which provides for the admission of Canadian-caught fish and fish oil free of duty. With the final adjustment of this treaty, our relations with Great Britain will bo of the most friendly character, which the President says it shall be his endeavor to main tain unbroken. Those who expected to find in the message the foreshadowing of an aggressive policy to ward Mexico, Cuba, and the West Indies will bo disappointed. The continuance of the Cuban, rebellion is referred to, and the continued exist ence of Cuban slavery condemned, but there is no intimation of a purpose to interfere with, either, except in the way of friendly advice to the Government of Spain, and the adoption of’ measures, if practicable, to prevent American, citizens from holding or dealing in slaves in. Cuba. There is no allusion in the message to Santo Domingo. The total receipts of the Treasury for tho fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, reached the large sum of $374,106,837, of which §216,370,236,. or nearly two-thirds, was derived from duties on imports. The receipts from internal taxation were §130,642,177. Tho disbursements during the same period were §377,478,216, of which §106,918,520 was for redemption of the princi pal of the public debt, and §117,357,839 for in terest. The current expenses of the Govern ment, exclusive of these two items, were §153,- 201,857. The President recommends that there be no further reduction of taxes at present. Ho thinks that justice to the public creditors re quires that the existing rate of taxation be maintained, and that specie payments should be resumed as soon as practicable, “having due regard to the interests of the debtor class and tho vicissitudes of trade and commerce.” Attention is called to plans for providing some cheaper means of transporting the pro ducts of the West and Southwest to the Atlantic seaboard. Wo regret that the only plans sug* gested are the proposed canal from the Lower Mississippi to Charleston or Savannah, and the proposed extension of the Kanawha & James River Canal, in Virginia, to the Ohio River. These canals would afford very little relief to the Northwest, where the pressure is now great est. The President recommends that a Com mittee or Commission he appointed to take the whole subject under consideration. The Postal Telegraph scheme is recommended in general terms; hut it is not expected that decisive action will he taken thereon during the present session of Congress. The decrease of our ocean-carrying trade has continued during the year, at an alarming rate, the President says, and it is suggested that an appropriation of $5,000,000 per annum might be usefully made in the endeavor to recover it. This is a very important matter, and we shall reserve what we desire to say regarding it for future discussion. Civil Service Reform does not receive the at attention which the public had been led to ex pect. The question is disposed of in a general way. The President says that he shall adhere to the Civil Service regulations promulgated last year, so far as they promise to furnish compe tent officers. Of course, this is all that can bo asked or expected, if there is a real intention to effect a reform, hut, on the other hand, it leaves open a wide door for the Camerons and Logans, and other opponents of Civil Service Reform, to drive their team through. We have touched upon the leading points in the message only. There are a number of less important subjects discussed, which we shall allude to hereafter. Meanwhile, the document itself should be attentively perused by all. 

REDUCING INTERNAL REVENUE EX- PENSES. At the last session at Congress, an act was passed providing for the consolidation of United States’ Assessors’ Districts, limiting the number in all to eighty, but delegating to the Commia sioner of Internal Revenue the process of con solidation. To bring the number of districts within the limit of the law, it would be neces sary to unite two, threo, and, in some cases, four, districts in one. Commissioner Douglass says, in his report, that it was found that an immediate reduction, in the manner prescribed by Congress, could not be made with out danger of losing a large amount of revenue. As an illustration of this possible loss, he points to the fact that Congress, last Juno, estimated the whole amount of internal revenue for the fiscal year at $110,000,000, while the collections of the first quarter of the current year were at the rate of $125,000,000 per annum. The difference is accounted for in back taxes due under the laws that had subsequently been repealed, and the Commissioner is of the opinion. that this difference would have been largely sacrificed by suddenly taking off the officials who, familiar with the affairs of their respective districts, knew how much was owing and who owed it. This comes in the shape of an excuse for de ferring an application of the now law; but, as the law has not yet been applied, Commissioner Douglass suggests another plan for reducing the expenses of the Internal Revenue Department, which is much more likely to accomplish the purpose of economy. This plan is briefly tbo abolition of the offices of Assessor and Assistant Assessor in the Internal Revenue service. Ho believes that all that is left for the Assessors to do, under the modifications of the Internal Rev enue law, can bo done just as well by the Col lectors and the Washington Bureau. Ho finds but threo duties of the Assessors, at present, which could not be discharged with equal pro priety and safety by the several Collectors, .and these three duties he proposes to have remanded to the Washington Bureau. They are the assessment of the deficiency taxes of distillers; the special or license taxes, which ore levied but once a year; and the tax on banks and bankers, payable only twice a year, and being the only taxes on corporations that are now levied. As most of these taxes, which are the only ones of a special or isolated character, are usually taken to the Bureau of Internal Revenue for review and readjustment, there seems to be no good reason why they should not bo sent there directly and certified back to the Collectors of the several districts. At one time, the tax on corporations, when it was much more general and complicated than now, was collected directly by the Washington Bureau, and the entire business was disposed of by fifteen clerks; in its present limited shape, there is no doubt that it could be handled by a smaller number of employes. The recommendation of the Commissioner will be received with favor by all classes who be lieve in the true spirit of Civil Service Reform, which is the economy of the public moneys. It is avast improvement up on the law of Congress, looking to the same object, and reducing the number of Assessors’ districts. In still keeping eighty Assessors;, and the same number of As sistant Assessors;, two distinct departments, with the separate offioos, organizations, and expenses of each, are retained. The number of subordi nate employes is about 1,300; and, while the Congressional law recommends a re duction of those as rapidly as consistent, it leaves the matter to the discretion of the As sessors themselves. It is not easy to displace more than a thousand place-holders, and, as the Commissioner says, “ nothing short of unequiv ocal, inexorable law can surely do it.” The plan which he suggests summarily disposes of 230 As sessors, 230 Assistant Assessors, and 1,000 subor dinates. The Assessors’ salaries, at $5,000 each, amount to $1,150,000 per year; the salaries of 1,300 assistants, at an average of $5 each per day, would amount to $1,850,000, counting 100 working days in tho year. By doing away with the department of Assessors altogether, there would thus he a saving of $3,000,000 an nually. The increased subordinate service in the Collectors’ offices would not amount to more than $1,0>00,000 a year, at the outside, for there would only be one set of high-salaried officials instead of two sets, one set of office-ex penses, more work, and less idleness. It is thus possible to make an ajituial saving of at least $2,000,000 in tho Internal Revenue system alone. Mr. Douglass’ plan will be likely to meet with oppositionfromcertainCongressional politicians, who will see in it a reduction of the offices which they expected to*parcel out as rewards for their retainers, their “ strikers blowers,” Its con sideration, however, will be a tolerably good test of the disposition of the present Congress in re gard to the practical support of the Civil Service Reform measures which President Grant has al ready inaugurated. —Miss Mary Nolan, of the St. Louis Central Magazine , has applied for a patent -for a porta ble reservoir, of her invention, which is to be used in prevent! og largo

BELIEF FOB DISTEESSED ASIEBICAXB ABBOAD. Congress, from the beginning of the Govern ment,^nas wisely made provision for the relief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar provision however, has hitherto been made for the relief of citizens in distress abroad, other than seamen. It is understood to be cus- ’ tomary with other Governments to authorize Consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or subjects in certain cases A similar authority and an appropriation to carry it into effect are commended in case of citizens of the United States destitute or sick, under such circumstances. It is well known that such citizens resort to foreign coun tries in great numbers. Though most of them are able to bear the expenses incident to locomotion, there are some who, through accident or otherwise, be come penniless, and have no friends at home able to succor them. Persons in this situation must either perish, cast themselves upon the charity of foreigners, or bo relieved at the private charge of our own officers, who usually, even T.ith 'the most benevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare for such purposes. Should the authority and appropriation asked for be made, care will bo taken to carry the beneficence of Congress into effect, that it shall not be unneces sarily or unworthily bestowed.

TAXATION. With the great reduction of taxation, by the acts of Congress at its last session, the expend iture of the Government in collecting the rev enue will be much reduced for the next fiscal year. - It is very doubtful, however, whether any further reduction of so vexatious a burden upon any people will be practicable for the present. At all events, as a measure of justice to the holders of the nation’s certificates of indebted ness, I would recommend that no more legisla tion be had upon this subject, unless it he to correct errors of omission or commission in the present laws, until a sufficient time has elapsed to prove that it can be done and still leave suffi cient revenue to meet the current expenses of the Government, pay interest on the public debt, and provide for the Sinking Fund established by law. The preservation of our nation’s credit is of the highest importance. 

RETURN TO SPECIE. Next in importance to this comes a solemn duty to provide National currency of fixed un varying value as compared with gold and as soon as practicable, having duo regard for the inter ests of the debtor class and the vicissitudes of trade and commerce, and convertible into gold at par. WAR DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of War shows tho expenditures of the War Department for the fiscal year ending June 30,1871, to be $35,799,- 991.82, and for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, to be $35,372,157.20, showing a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year of $127,834.62. The estimates for military appropriations for the next fiscal year ending June SO, 1874, arc $3,380,137,878. The estimates of the Chief of Engineers are submitted separately for fortifications, river and harbor improvements, and for public buildings and grounds, and the Washington aqueduct. fbeedmen’s bureau. The affairs of the Freedman's Bureau have all been transferred to the War Department, and regulations have been put into execution for the speedy payment of bounty, pay, etc., due the colored soldiers, properly coming under that Bureau. All the war accounts for money and property prior to 1871, have been examined and transmitted to the Treasury for final settlement. During the fiscal year there has been paid for transportation on railroads $1,800,000, of which $60,857 was over the Pacific Railroads; for transportation by water, $62,037,352, and by stage, $4,897,589; and for the purchase of trans portation animals, wagons, hire of teamsters, etc., $92,465,064. About $370,000 have been collected from Southern railroads during the year, leaving about $4,000,000 still due. The Quartermaster has examined and trans mitted to the accounting officers for settlement $36,717,272 of claims by loyal citizens for Quar termasters* stores, taken during the war. Sub sisting supplies to the amount of $8,904,812 have been issued to Indians, The annual average mean strength of the army was 24,210 white, and 2,494 colored soldiers. The total deaths for the year reported, were 367 white and 54 colored. ~ , , . , The distribution of the medical and surgical history of the war is yet to be ordered by Con gress. There exists an absolute necessity for a medical corps of the full number established ,by act of Congress of July 23, 1866,-there being now 59 vacancies, and the number of successful candidates rarely exceeds 8 or 10 in any one year* THE BIVEB AND HABBOB EIPBOVZ2IZNTS have been carried forward with energy and econ omy, though many are only partially completed. The results have saved to commerce many times the amount expended. The increase of com merce with greater depth of channels, greater security in navigation, and the saving of time, adds much to the wealth of the country, and in creases the resources of the Government. The bridge across the Mississippi River at Rock Island has been completed, and the proper site has been determined Upon for the bridge at LaCrosse. The able and exhaustive report made by the Commission appointed to investigate the sutro Tunnel has been transmitted to Congress, Zhd.fihiemtion and reports of the Signal Of- fice have been continued. Stations have been maintained at each of the principal lake, sea* port, and river cities. Ten additional stations nave been’established in the United States, and arrangements have been made for an exchange of reports with Canada, and a similar exchange of observations is contemplated with the West India Islands. The favorable attention of Congress is invited to the following of the Secretary of War: A discontinuance of the appointment of extra Lieutenants to servo as Adjutants and Quartermasters; the adoption of a codo providing a specific penalty for well-defined offences, so that the irregularity of sentences adjudged hy court martial maybe adjusted; the consolidation of accounts under which expenditures are made, as a measure of economy; a reappropriation of the money for the construction of a depot at San Antonio, the title to the site being now per fected ; a special act placing the cemetery at the City of Mexico on the same basis as other national cemeteries; authority to purchase sites for military posts in Texas; the appointment of commissary sergants from non-commissioned officers, as a measure for securing the better care and protection of supplies; an appropria tion for the catalogues and tables of the anatomi cal section of the army medical museum; a reappropriation of the amount for the manufac ture of breech-loading arms, should the selec tion bo so delayed by the Board of Officers to leave the former appropriations unexpended at the close of the fiscal year; the sale of such arsenals east of the Mississippi as can be spared, and the proceeds applied to the establishment of one largo arsenal of construction and repair upon the Atlantic coast, and the purchase of a suitable site for a proving and experimental ground for heavy ordnance; the abrogation of the laws which deprive inventors in the United States service from deriving any bene fit from their invention; the repeal of the law prohibiting promotions in the staff corps; a continuance of the work npon the coast defences ; the repeal of the seventh section of the act of July 13, 1866, taking from engineer soldiers the per diem granted to other troops ; a limitation of time for the presentation of sub sistence supplies under act of July 4,1864, and a modification in the mode of the selection of cadets for the Military Academy in order to enhance the usefulness of the academy, which is impaired by reason of the large amount of time necessarily expended in giving new cadets a thorough knowledge of the more elementary branches of learning, which they should acquire before entering the Academy; also an appropria tion for philosophical apparatus and an increase in the number and the pay of the Military Aca demy Band. .$216,370,286.77 2,575,714.19 130,642,177.72 nTTRApTTR TBANBPOBTATION'. The attention of Congress mi be called, dnr ing its present session, to various enterprises for the more certain and cheaper transportation of the constantly increasing surplus of the Western and Southern products to the Atlantic sea border. The subject is one that mil force itself upon the legislative branch of the Govern ment sooner or later, and I suggest, therefore, that immediate steps be taken to gam all avail able information to insure equitable and just legislation. One route to connect the Missis sippi Valley with the Atlantic at Charleston, S. C., and Savannah, Ga., by water, by the way of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers and canals, and slack water navigation to the Savannah and Ocmulgee rivers, has been surveyed and a re port made by an accomplished engineer officer of the army. Second and third new routes will be proposed for the considera tion of Congress, namely, by an extension of the Kanawha and James River Canal to the Ohio, and by the extension of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. .$106,918,520.30 .$377,478,216.21 I am not prepared to recommend Government aid to these or other enterprises, until it is clear* ly shown that they are not only of national in* terest, but that when completed they will be of a value commensurate with their cost. That the production increases more rapidly than the means of transportation in our country has been demonstrated by past experience. That the un precedented growth in the population and pro jects of the whole country will require addi tional facilities and cheaper means for the more bulky articles of commerce to reach tide water and a market, will be demanded in the near future, is equally demonstrable. I would, therefore, suggest a Committee or Commission to be authorized to consider the whole question, and to report to Congress at some future day for its better guidance in legislating on the im portant subject. The railroads of the country have been rap idly extended during the last few years to meet the growing demands of producers, and reflect much credit upon the capitalists and managers engaged in their construction. In addition to these, a project to facilitate commerce bv the building of a ship canal around Niagara Falls, on the United States side, which has been agitated for many years, will, no doubt, be called to your attention this session. Look ing to the great future of the country, the in creasing demands of commerce, it might be well, while on this subject, not only to have examined and report upon the various practicable routes for connecting the Mississippi with the tide water on the Atlantic, but the feasibility of an .almost continuous land-locked navigation from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico. Such a route along our coast would be of great value at all times, and of inestimable value in case of a foreign war. Nature has provided the greater part of this route, and the obstacles to be overcome are easily within the skill of the engineer. I have not alluded to this subject with the view of having any further expenditure of pub lic money at this time than may be necessary to procure and place all the necessary information before Congress in an authentic form, to enable it hereafter, if doomed practicable and worthy, to legislate on the subject without delay. .$ 99.960,253.54 $103,290,956.50 2,746,465.22 $100,544,491.28 .$363,696,999.87 The report of the Secretary of the Navy, here with accompanying, explains fully the condition of that branch of the public service, its wants and deficiencies, expenses incurred during the past year, and appropriations for the same. It also gives a complete history of the services of the Navy for the past year in addition to its regular services. It is evident that unless steps are taken to preserve onr navy, that in a very few years the United States will be the upon tho Ocean, .of all the great powers. With an energetic, progressive people like ours, pen etrating and forming business relations with every part of the known world, a navy strong enough to command tho respect of onr flag abroad is necessary for the full protection of their rights. I recommend careful considera tion by Congress of the recommendations made by the Secretary of the Navy. 

POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT. The accompanying report of the Postmaster General furnishes a fnll and satisfactory exhibit of the operations of the Post Office Department during the year. The ordinary revenues of the Department for the fiscal year ending June SO, 1872, amounted to §21,915,426.37, and the ex penditures §26,658,192.21. Compared with tho grevious fiscal year, the increase of revenue was . 1,878,380.95, or 9.37 per cent, and the increase of expenditures §2,263,088.23, or 9.29 per cent. Adding to the ordinary revenues the annual ap preciation of §700,000 for free matter and the amounts paid to tho subsidies on mail steamship lines from special appropriations, the deficiency paid out of the general treasury was §3,317,765.94, an excess of §389,706.23 over the deficiency for the year 1871. Other interesting statistical information relating to onr rapidly extending postal service is furnished in tins re- Jort. The total length of railroad mail routes on on© 30, 1872, was 57,911 miles ; 8,077 addi tional miles of such service having been put into operation during the year. Eight new lines of railway Post Offices have been established, with an aggregate length of 2,909 miles. The num ber of letters exchanged in the mails with foreign countries was 24,362,500, on. increase of 4,066,502, or 20 per cent over 1 the number in 1871, and the postage thereon amounts to §1,871,257.25. The total weight of the mails exchanged with European countries exceeded 820 tons. Tho cost of the United States trans-Atlantic mail steamship service was §220,- 301.70. The total cost of the United States ocean steamship including the .amounts paid to the subsidized lines of Tnail steamers, was §1,107,020.97. The following are the only steamship lines now receiving subsidies for mail service, under special acts of Congress: The Pacific Mail Steamship Company receive §500,000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between San Francisco, Japan, and China, which will be increasec to §1,000,000 per annum, and a semi-monthly mail on and after Oct. 1, 1873. Tho United States & Brazil Mail Steamship Company receive §150,000 per »nnnm for carrying a monthly mall between New York and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and the California Oregon A Mexico Steamship Company receive §75,000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between San Francisco and Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, making the total amount of mail steam ship subsidies at present $725,000 par annum. Our postal communications with all parts of the civilized world have been placed upon a most advantageous footing by the improved postal conventions and arrangements recently concluded with the leading commercial countries of Europe and America, and the.gratifying statement is made that with the conclusion of a satisfactory con vention with Franco, tho details of which have been definitely agreed to by tho head 91 tbo 

BECOSI3IENDATIONS NAVY DEPARTMENT, WEAKEST NATION French Postal Department, subject to the ap proval of the Minister of Finance, little remains to bo accomplished by treaty for some time to come. With respect to a reduction of rate, and im proved facilities for postal intercourses, your fa vorable consideration is respectfully in vited to the recommendations made -by the Postmaster General for an increase of service from monthly to semi-monthly trips on the mail steamship route to Brazil; for a sub sidy in aid of the establishment of an American line of mail steamers between San Francisco, New Zealand, and Australia; for the establishment of Post Office savings banks, and for the increase of the salaries of the heads of Bureaus. THE FRANKING PRIVILEGE. I have heretofore commended the abolition of the franking privilege, and know no reason now for changing my views on that subject. It not having been favorably regarded by Congress however, I now suggest a modification of that privilege to correct its glaring and costly abuses POSTAL TELEGRAPHY. • I would recommend, also, the appointment of a Committee or Commission to take into con sideration the best method, equitable to private corporations who have invested their time and capital in the establishment of telegraph lines, of acquiring the title to all the telegraph lines now in operation, and of connecting this service with the postal service of the nation. It is hot probable that this subject could receive the proper consideration during the limits of a short session of Congress, but it may be initiated, so that any further action may bo fair to the Gov ernment and to private parties concerned. AMERICAN MATT. STEAMSHIP SUBSIDIES. There are but three lines of ocean steamers, namely, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, between San Francisco, China, and Japan ,‘with provision made for semi-monthly service after Oct. 1,1873; the United States and Brazil line, monthly; and the California, Now Zealand, and Australian line, monthly, plying between the United States and foreign ports, and owned and operated under our nag. I earnestly recom mend that such liberal contracts for carrying the mails be authorized with these lines as will in sure their continuance, if the expediency of extending the aid of the Government to lines of steamers, which hitherto have not received it, should be deemed worthy of the consideration of Congress. Political and commercial objects make it advisable to bestow such aid on a line under our flag between Pana ma and the western South American porta. By this means, much trade, now diverted to other countries, might be brought to ns, to the mutual advantage of this country and those lying in that quarter of the continent of America. AMERICAN COMMERCE. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will show an alarming falling off in our carrying trade for the last ten or twelve vears, and even for the past year. Ido not believe that the pub lic treasure can be better expended in the inter est of the whole people than in trying to recover this trade. An expenditure of §5,000,000 per annum for the next five years, if it would restore to ns our proportion of the carry ing-trade of the world, would be profitably ex pended. The price of labor in Europe has so much enhanced within the last few years, that the coat of building and operating ocean steam ers in the United States is not so much greater than in Europe, that I believe the time has arrived for Congress to take this subject into serious consideration. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. Detailed statements of the disbursements through the Department of Justice will be fur nished bythe report of the Attorney General, and though these have been somewhat increased by the recent acts of Congress to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of the Union, and to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and the amendments thereto, I cannot question the ne cessity and salutary effect of these enactments. ixU-KLu.t. Reckless and lawless men, I regret to say, heve associated themselves together in some localities, to deprive other citizens of the right guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United States, and to that end have committed deeds of violence, but the prevention and pun ishment of many of these persons have tended greatly to the repression of such disorders. I do not doubt that a great majority of the people in all parts of the country favor the full enjoyment, by all classes of per sons, of these rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution and the laws, and to invoke the aid and influence of all good citizens to prevent organizations whose objects are by unlawful means to inter fere with those rights. 1 look with confidence to the time, not far distant, when the obvious advantages of good order and peace will induce an abandonment of all combinations prohibited by the acts referred to, and when it will be un necessary to carry on prosecutions or inflict Enniahments to protect citizens for the law 3ss doings of such combinations. Applications have been made to me to pardon persons convicted of a violation of said acta, upon the ground that clemency in such cases would tend to tranquilize the public mind, and to test the virtue of that policy I am as far as my sense of justice will permit, to give these applications a favorable consideration but any action thereon is not to construed as indicating any change in my deter mination to enforce with vigor such act, so long as the conspiracies and combinations therein named disturb the peace of the country. It is much to be regretted, and is regretted by no one more than myself, that a necessity has ever ex isted to execute the enforcement act. No one can desire more than I that the necessity of ap plying it may never again be demanded. DEPABTSTESTC OP THE IXTEBIOB. The Secretary of the Interior reports satlsfac- Tory improvement and progress in each of the several bureaus under the control of the Interim Department. They are all in excellent condi tion. The work, which in some of them ftf some years has been in arrears, has been brongS down to a recent date, and in all the currei business has been promptly despatched. INDIANS. The policy which was adopted at the bega ing of the Administration, with regard to ae management of the Indians, has been as succes ful as its most ardent friends antci pated. within so short a time. It ias reduced the expense of their management, ie creasod their forages upon the white setle ments, tended to give the largest opportunity to the extension of the great railways through :ha public domain, and the pushing of settlemeits into the more remote districts of the county, and at the same time improve the condition of the Indians. The policy will be maintained wnh out any change excepting such as further experi ence may. show to be necessary to render it mote efficient. Tho subject of converting the so-called In dian Territory, south of Kansas, into a home for tho Indian, and erecting thereon a Territorial form of Government is of great importance, as a complement of the existing Indian policy. The question of removal to the Territory has within the past year been presented to many of the tribes resident upon other less desirable portions of the public domain, and has gen erally been received by them with favor. As a preliminary step to the organization o: such a Territory, it will bo necessar to confine the Indiana now resident therein to farms of proper size, which sould be secured to * them in fee, the residue to be need for the setr tlement of other friendly Indians. Efforts will be made in the immediate future to induce the removal of as many peaceably-disposed Indian/ only to the Indian Territory as can be settled properly, without disturbing the harmony a those already thero. There is no other locatior now available where a people who are endeavor ing to acquire a knowledge of pastoral and agr: cultural pursuits, can be as well accommodate as upon the unoccupied lands in the Indian Ter •ritory. A Territorial Governments should, protect the Indians from the inroad of whites ** • a term of years, until they become snfficieJy advanced in the arts of civilizationto guard tail own rights, and from the disposal of the held by them from the same period.
