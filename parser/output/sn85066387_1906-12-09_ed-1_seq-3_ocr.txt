The San Francisco Sunday Pall. • FATE VENGEANCE ON THE BOODLERS Strange Disaster Has Pur cned Even the Unconvicted of the St Louis Boodlers: Does Their Experience Spell a Terrible Lesson to Men Now Under Fire in San Francisco? THE violent death of Robert M. Bnyier, a Kansas City million aire—called the king of Western boodlers— -has written finis after the world's most remarkable crusade •.gainst bribery. The death of Snyder, •who spent a quarter of a. million dol lars in 1899 to corrupt the Municipal Assembly of St. Louis to pass a street railway franchise bill, out of the sale of which he cleared f1,550/000, is the climax of a. series of misfortunes and tragedies that has pursued so relent lessly the men who were caught In the boodle trap sprung by Joseph W. Folk four years ago. that the .question has. been asked whether fate has not joined bands with the law to heap punishment upon their heads. Twenty-two men were indicted by St. Louis grand juries for participation in three great briberies, in which more than $300,001) was paid for the votes of Assemblymen. Misfortune of some Uind — death, insanity, want, or loss of for tune — has visited the families of six teen of them. Three of them are dead. Snyder. trbosc case was probably the moet celebrated of all, was under in dictment in SL Louis when he was thrown out of hi 3 automobile' within a few blocks of fois magnificent home on Independence boulevard. Kansas City, on the night of October 27, and killed. When the Circuit Attorney of St. Louis tt tew days laler entered a nolle prose quj in the case the docket of the crim inal courts was cleared of all the booiJle cvr-r-s which Folk instituted dur ing th*» two years that he had bribery undn 1 investicatiofi. But sevon men wrre sent to the pen itentiary for bribery. One other is un der B^ntonce, but his case Is pcndlnu In tlie- Supreme Court. But not one of the m~n — even those who escaped the penitentiary by turning State's evi dence—would pass throusrh the expe rience of the last four ycarß for all the brib* money that the wealthiest cor poration of the country could put up to buy votes. The lawmaker who is tempted to sell his vote may learn •omething to his advantage by study ing carefullN- the unpleasant experi ences of the men who gave and re ceived bribes in Pt. Louis. If the St. Louis boodlers sowed the they reaped the tornado. Next to Snyfier. Charles H. Turner, who died broker, hearted in New York last sum mer, a virtual outcast from St. Louis, •where he made a fortune amounting to millions of dollars, was the moet lav ish bribe giver exposed during the fight against corruption. He was the nrst man caught — and the first man •who ran to Folk to save himself from the penitentiary. "When the late "Red" Galvin, a veteran newspaper reporter, T.-elUpd into the offics of Folk early in January, 1902, and told him that Charles H. Turner and Philip Stock, his legislative agent, has placed $147, 600 in escrow in two trust companies' vaults to bribe the Municipal Assem bly to pass a franchise bill for the Suburban Street Railway Company, the boodle crusade began. Two days later Turner was virtually on his knees before the Circuit Attorney begging for mercy. The only alternative to the penitentiary was to go on the witness stand and tell the whole corrupt and shameful story. He chose the alter native. At the time of his exposure he was president of a big trust company as well as of the street railway com pany. He was promptly retired, and pretty soon the stockholders of the trust company decided that they need ed another man at the head of the in ttitutlon. Turner found that he could not re main in business in St. Louis. In spite ef his big fortune. He went to New Tork and was almost forgotten in his old horne — say« for his perfidy in bribing the clty> law/nakprs — when he died of «t broken heart. Tragedy Is Complete Snyder's . last days were full of trouble. "Within a month of his death the bleaching bones of his son, Cary 11. Enyder, were found in a lonely spot near Hilleboro, Or. The young man. a fugitive from justice for two years, had probably been murdered by one of a band of robbers of, which he was a member. On the very night- that the. elder Snyder died, the widow of his son confessed that her dead husbanu was a member of an organized band of robbers, who had been cracking, safes throughoTU the Western country. Cary Snyder kept his father in constant trouble for nearly three years before h. wa» killed.' R. M. Snyfler went to St. Louis in the spring of 1898 and consummated a dar ing and colossal bribery. He prepared a street railway franchise bill, cover- Ing streets for more than one hundred , miles, paralleling existing lines, and in troduced it in the Municipal Assembly. He at first succeeded in getting* it passed with little difficulty. It was vetoed by the Mayo jr. and he then set about to buy up the necessary three-fourths majority of both^ branches of the legislative body of the' city. The House of Delegates, which had been controlled, by a corrupt com bine for years, readily accepted $75,000 for voting the necessary majority, but Snyder did not tlnd such smooth sailing in the more dignified and less populous Council. The Council had but thirteen members, but not one of them was cheap. The president of the Council got $50,000 that was Intended for Fred erick G. UthofT, whose testimonT in a great trial conducted by Folk in the fall of ISO 2 resulted, in Snyder" s con viction and sentence of five years in the penitentiary. Uthoff, playing for n. bribe of $100,000, found after having voted for the bill that Snyder would not keep his promises, and after infinite trouble he succeeded In getting Snyder to pay him $5000 in New Vhrk in ex change for a letter, in which he staged that from what he knew of Snyder ho', was as : much above offering a brlba as he (Uthoff) would "be of accepting one. . . Sns'der finally got his- bill through. The. town reeked with stories of cor ruption. Facts specific enough to war rant Indictments against the . entire boodle combine in the House and Coun cil. &.s well as the. promoters, were laid before the Grand Jury. But that body, controlled by powers In sympathy with the reign of corruption, instead of vot ing indictments against the perpetra tors of these crimes tried to procure evidence upon which to indict those who testified against the corruption ists for libel and slander. It was not until four years later. that Folk got hold of the same evidence. There is a statute of limitations In Mis souri which provides that persons shall b« exempt from prosecution for certain classes of crime unless an indictment shall be returned within three year*. This statute, which covered bribery, seemed to let Snyder out. Lived in New York JJut Folk looked around and discov ered that Snyder went directly to New York after getting his bill passed and lived there during the next year. This furnished him a peg upon which tc hang the prosecution, an absence from the State slopped the running of the statute. By tome close figuring it was found that Snyder had remained out of the State just one day too long to en title him to the protection of this stat ute, and he was indicted early in 1902. He was tried in October of the same year. After one of the most notable of legal battles, in which Folk fought against an array of the, finest legal talent that money could hire, Hnyder was convicted and sentenced lo five years in the peni tentiary. The case went to the Su preme Court and was reversed on a technicality.. Before it could be tried again Folk went>out of office, having been elected Governor. The Snyder . ease was one of the few that he passed down to Arthur N. Sager. his successor.! Last May Sager nolle prossed the case and issued a new information against Snyder. The case was called for trial in September, but, owing to the ab sence of material witnesses • for the State, it was again nolle prossed and a new information sworn out. At tho same time Sager indicted- Frederick G. Uthoff for perjury, charging him with swearing falsely before the Grand Jury when the Snyder case was under'lnves tigation four years ago, Uthoff having slnceheen a non-residentof the State. He issued an information ag-ainst Wil liam H. Ritter. a former member of the House pf Delegates, who voted for Sny der's franchise bill, charging him with conspiring to hold Snyder up for money as a consideration for not testifying against him. This case was standing against Sny der when death entered the final nolle prosequi. , The cases against: Uthoff and Hitter, growing indirectly out Of a. bribery committed some years ago, are the only entries on the court dockets to remind St. Louis of her famous munici- , pal' scandals. Ed' Butler, the boss politician: who was three times indicted and twice tried for bribery, has had his troubles, too. -Butler was first, indicted for at tempting to bribe members of the Board of Health to award him a ; contract; for handling the «, city garbage, He was tried In Columbia, Mo., convicted and sentenced to three years In the peni tentiary, but escaped when the Supnyne Court decided that as the membersTof . the Board of Health were not' officials they could not be bribed. He was next indicted for handling a > boodle fund • of : $47,500 to have passed a; bill. providing /for the lighting of, the streets, with gas instead of electricity. He was acquit ted of this charge at , Fulton, Mo., and ; in V that~ respect considered \u0084 himself lucky. Soon after his first indictment \u25a0his con-in : law, : John-Parle,v died., : B efore he was tried ;on" the second indict ment his favorite" son, John B. Butler, who had been faithful to the old man's interests during his present .troubles, fell- sick and died. This. blow broke Butler's heart and hurt him worse than all of Folk's. prpsecuti.ons. \u0084. \u0084- .

Jerry was a mem ber of \u25a0 the . combine. He Joined tba famous birthday party held at Julius Lehmann's house when the 147,500 was « divided into equal packages and dis- - trlbuted among nineteen men. He took his $2500. Folk got him and sent him •to the penitentiary for two years. In the prime of his manhood he entered prison July IS, 1904. When he served his term out his eyes were sightless. He walked out of the prison last sum mer a free man. but he will never see the light of day again unless a sur geon's skill can restore the sight which now seems to be permanently Impaired. All day long he sits in a darkened room in a little North St. Louis home, unable to work, a charge upon his friends. But for the friendship of. Ed Butler Hannlgan would be in actual want. Ellis TTalnwright, a millionaire brewer who was a -director In the Suburban Railway Company when it attempted to buy up the Council- and House of Delegates, has been exiled in Paris for more than four years. An indictment for « bribery Is pending against him in St Louis and he dare not return. His property interests have depreciated, many thousands »f "dollars during his enforced absence. Charles Gutke. a former member of the House" of Delegates, was indicted for bribery in* September, 1902. ,So many of the boodlers had .run away to escape punishment that\ the courts would not accept bail at less than $20. 000. Ed Butler signed, bonds until he would not be~ accepted "on 1 more. As a consequence Gutke was confined in Jail for six weeks. During that time his 19-year-old son, Eugene, was stricken . down with galloping consumption and died. • Gutke was later permitted ' to turn State's evidence and escaped pros ecution. Folk Gets His Vengeance Charles Kratz was the first member of the City Council to.be indicted for bribery. He was charged with partici pation in the Suburban bribery deal, and. like Murrell. he fled to Mexico be fore his case came to trial. • - After two years' persistent work Folk succeeded in influencing the, ; United States - Government to .make a treaty with Mexico covering the crime of bribery. The Attorney Get.eral of the United Statea construed thi«« treaty to \u25a0be retroactive and under Sts pro** \u25a0visions Kratz was extradited. Scarcely ; had- he ; returned to St. Louis -in the spring of 1905. when -he was attacked by appendicitis and. for months hov ered between life and death. His sick . ness, however, might have been consid ered a turn of fortune in his favor, because it enabled-him to get his case carried on the dockets until after Folk ,was I elected Governor, and when he was : tried at Butler. Mo., he was ac- .quitted. .Before he was tried one of his 'children died. , ; Louis Decker, a liveryman, is the only member of the -old House of < Delegates cambjne who was convicted after Folk quit the Circuit s Attorney's office, y, His hastened the death v ot his aged mother, \u25a0 which Oc curred few weeks after the jury found him, guilty. \u25a0 \u25a0 Edmund :Bersch. once a prosperous insurance broker, was' the first of the ;House of Delegates combine to begin a i terra of ; service in the '- penitentlary: Hls : mind gave way under; the strain, ; and he .spent the greater part of -his . eighteen months' imprisonment in the hospital.
