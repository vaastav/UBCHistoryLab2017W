Market depress ed. Letters from New Orleans say that it is ascer tained that tho planters have resolved to hold up their cotton, ami the sudden failing off in tho re ceipts at the ports (amounting to nearly ono-half) ^ amplo confirmation of the fact. The reason as signed by the planters for their course is the se vere depression that exists in tho Atlantic and iiu!f markets, and tho suspension by tho banks of uaorgia, South Carolina and other States, through which their exchanges are done. It is thought that this action of tho planters will have a tenden cy to arrest a further downward movement of the staple. The decline already submitted to on the balance of tho crop yet to be received, (estimating ?jo whole crop at 4,000,000 bales) amouuts in round figures to about fifteen millions dollars.

Public Meeting in Fairfax. At an adjourned meeting of the citizens of Fairfax county, irrespective of party, held at tbe Court-House of the county, on Saturday, the 1st day of December, 1800, pursuant to public notice?on the motion of Thomas Moore, esq., (the chairman of the former meeting being absent) Alfred Mos?, esq., was called to the Chair, and John T. Burke, one of tbe Secretaries of the former meeting, acted as Secretary. The Committee, appointed at the first meeting to report to thismeetiug resolusions expressive of the sentiments oi the people in reference to the political affairs of the coun ty, stated through their chairman, H. \V. Thomas, esq., that in consequence of the failure of several members of the committee to attend at the time appointed, nothing had been agreed upon. lie road to the meeting sundry resolutions prepared by him, as em bodying his individual sentiments, but de clined offering them for the consideration of the meeting. Thomas J. Murray, esq., oue of the mem bers of the committee, then offered to the meeting for its consideration the following preamble and resolutions, which elicited con siderable debate, and in which II. W. Thom as, Win. II. Dulauy, Thomas Moore, John Powell and Thomas J. Murray, csqrs., par ticipated: Whkrkas, the last quarter of a century has been replete with insults ami injuries on the part of a large majority ofthe peopio of the North to tho South, and of aggressions on the institution of Slavery in tho South; And AVtikkeas, the late Chicago Convention was a purely sectional one, made up alone of the non-slavcholding States and in which uo honorable man from a sluveholding State could occapy a seat, because of the abolition elements of which said Convention was niado up; And Whereas, said Convention put forth a plat form of principles destructive ofthe equality of the States and the equal rights ofthe citizens of the : States iu the Territories thereof, the practical ef fect of whieh will be to prevent the admission in to tho Union of any State with the feature of sla very in her constitution: And Whechas, the said Convention nominated candidates for the Presi idency and Vico Presidency who entertained and avowed the same principles, both of whieh candi dates belonged to tho abolition States, and have been elected exclusive by tho overwhelming votes ofthe aou-slaveholding States?Be it therefore, 1st. Resolved. That considering the material of whieh tho late Chicago Convention was made up, and the principles and domieils of its nominees for tho Presidency and Vice Presidency, wo cannot but regard the election of Abraham Lincoln to tho Presidency and Hannibal Hamlin to the Vicc Pres idency as an aggression upon our rights and a di rect attack on the institution of slavery and tho equality of the States. 2, Resolved, That we believe that a condition of affairs might exist which would justify any sover eign State in resuming the powers originally gran ted to tho Federal Government. 3d. Resolved, That the overt acts of aggression I on the part of a decided majority ofthe people of I the North upon the institutions ofthe South have I been ample and sufBcieut in justifying the South ern States in resuming their original sovereignty and annulling tho powers delegated to tbe Federal Government. 4th. Resolved, That wo cordially approve of the proclamation of the Governor of Virginia con vening our Legislature to consider the condition of public affairs. 5th. Resolved, That wo deem it the duty of the Legislature, when assembled, to press forward the work already begun of preparing and arming tho State for defence in any emergency, and to recom mend a call of a Convention oi the people, to as semble as soon as practicable, that such measures may be adopted as may seem best calculated to maintain the honor and rights of tho St p. to: The vote upon the adoption of the pream ble and each resolution was taken separate ly. The preamble and 1st, 3d and 4th reso lutions were adopted without opposition. F. D. Richardson, esq., offered as a substi tute for the 2d resolution of Mr. Murray the following, which were adopted by a large majority: Resolved, That w? believe a btatc has it right to secedo from tho Union for causes which she con siders justifiable, and tlio Federal Government has uo right to force such seceding &t ate back into tho Union. Resolved, That it un ?tt*5Uipt phouid be iuhJo ??y the Federal Government thus to force a seceding State, a sister State would be justifiable in pro tecting her against such force. Resolved, That Virginia should resist the pas sage of hkv force through her territory which might be sent to coerce a receding State. Wai. II. Dulanj, esq., offered tin niaend ment to the 5th resolution 61" Mr. Murray to the effect that "the Legislature should _snl? mit the question tu the people of the State whether a convention should be called" as proposed by said resolution. Upou a divi sion the amendment was iost by a small ma jority and the 5th resolution adopted*. On motion of John Powell, esq., it was Resolved. That our Senator and Delegate be re quested to vote for an immediate call ot a conveu tion. M, A. B. Williams, esq., oftered the following which was adopted: Whereas, the Governor of the State of Ohio, in direct conflict with the 4t'u article ot the Constitu tion of the United States, has failed and refused to deliver two escaped criminals, (Brown and lie riain) charged with treason, felony and other uigh crimes at the raid at Harpers J*erry, anu who were rigbfuliy douianJcd of bnu by the Go\crn^o? of Virginia; and whereas, tho Legislature >>t \ ir ^iuia a.t its last session, tor want of time and the lateness of Gov. Letcher's message failed to take any action in the premises, it now becomes the imperative duty ot the Legislature, at its approach ing session, to take such prompt- and decisive action in tho caso as tho honor and dignity ot the Com mon wealth requires; and it redress be not prompt ly and speedily made, and ample guarantees se cured again:-i any future violations ot the rights of Virginia-, that our Senator and Delegate be, an i they are hereby, instructed thai so soon as it can bo ascertained that the General Government is unable or unwilling to redress these wrongs < i protoct our rights, to cause immediate notice to be "iven to our sister States and tneGenera! Govern ment at Washington that Virginia will forthwith withdraw her support from the lederal tiovern mont, resumo such powers as she has hereto fore delegated in tha Inderal compact, and as sume that separate and equal station among her sister States and the Nations of the earth that the stout hearts and strong arms ot our ancestor? ex torted from the British throne?relying upon her sons to emulate the deeds of their sires and ?0 hand down their rights unimpaired to their pos terity. _ Jumes W. Jackson, es^., offered the ioi lowing resolutions which were adopted: 1st. Resolved, That we regard any Virginian who would accept office under the administration of Abraham Lincoln, v>r continue to hold office under the General Goyerniooni after hi:' inan^ora tion, aa regardless of the honor ot h>s Stato ?n<l untrue to any of its interests. 2d. Rosolved, That we acknowledge the tree dornoftho ballot box to its fullest extent, but that outrages have been committed by the election of Abraham Lincoln, and that those amongst us who have voted tho Black Republican ticket be requested to remove to the froe States where .Lt-y can tiad sympathizers. On motion, the meeting adjourned.

E. Harrison, e&q., was called to the j ; Chair, and E. \y. Latemcr was appointed I 1 Secretary, when Gen. Jiunton, after some j i appropriate remarks, offered the following i preamble and resolutions: ; Whereas. this Union was formed "to establish ; justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for j j coin id on defence, promote tho geuerul welfare, i : and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves ; j and our posterity;" find whereas the Northern j people of the Union, constituting a majority, re 1 gardless of our Constitutional rights, but led on ! aud controlled by fanatical hostility to our in* ! stitutioD of slavery, have perpetrated injustice i upon us by the passage in their State Legislatures \ of acts annulling the Constitutional laws of Con j gress for the recovery of our property, called Per ; sonn! Liberty Bills, and have destroyed domestic J tranquility in our midst, by inciting our thousands : of happy aud oontented slaves to servile insur J ruction?instead of providing for the common da i fcv.cc, they have sent out armed bands of desps j rate criminals to destroy our property aud murder | our citizens?instead of providing for the general i welfare, they have in six weeks caused a depre j ciation iu the vaiue of Southern property of iriil j lions, and eroatcd a wide spread commercial panic; ; and whereas this fanatical feeling, from which we bavo {suffered theso grievances, h>?s recently culmi nated in the election, by a purely sectional voto, of a President and Vice President, pledged to further acts of aggression upon our rights, we, the | people of this county, think thut a determined and i uncompromising stand should be taken against oppression now; and, thereforo, as the sense of this meeting, Uesolved, That the Constitution of the Uni ted States is a compact between the several sov ereignties composing this Union, and that the Federal Government is the agent of theso sover eignties, with no other power than those dele gated. 2d. That, in the language of Daniel "Webster, "a bargain broken on one side, is broken on all sides," and, therefore, not binding on any. 'id. That each State has tho right to judge as well of the infraction of the Constitution, as of the mode and measure of redress. 4th. That we approve the cali by the Governor of Virginia for the Legislature to meot in extra session, but we deeply regret and hereby disap prove of the postponement of its mooting until the 7th of January. bth. That we think it tho duty of the Legisla ture, at tho earliest practical momeut, to call a Convention of the people of this State, to deter mine on some efficient means for the protection of our rights. ijth. That we consider it the duty of Virginia to J aid and assist tho State of South Carolina with all her power, in caso tho Federal Government should attempt to coerce the said State into sub mission. 7?/t. That when our Legislature shall meet, wo hereby rospcctfully but earnestly suggest that they shall immediately proceed to put the State iu a proper condition for defence, by arming the military of the State with the most improved wea pons of modern warfare, and we hereby instruct our Senator and Delegare to use their best endea vors to obtain the necessary appropriation to so arm the military of the State. 8//*. That a copy of theso resolutions be for warded to our Senator aud .Representative. John T. Williams, esq., Gen. Ilunton, and J. M.

The New Rifle Company.?This new ! military company, the organization of which i was uioticod in yesterday'** Gazette, is des I tined to become an-honor to our city. Of j its officers it is only necessary to say, that ! tho Captain, who .served with disdnctiou in j the Mexican War, is a gentleman whose ac | knowledged familiarity with military affairs, ; arid whose courteous bearing, will always se i cure to hiu) the confidence andobc-dience of any I corps to the commaucTof which he may be call-' ! ed. The First Leutenant while first officer of : tho Alexandria Rifir-s, by his frank disposition I and soldier-like unselfishness,combined with a precise and nice perceptability of the require ments of Military discipline, won the good will and admiration of the whole company. The second officer too, has been in command of a corps, and is as conversant with Hardee and Scott as he is with Euclid. The Third Lieu tenant has the V. M. I. for his Alma Ma ter, and as a necessary consequence is aufait with everything pertaining to Army regula tions. "With such officers and with such ma terial as we understand the company is com posed of, there is 110 doubt that it will prove, ? as w? have said above, not only a pride to i our city but an element in its defense and in Virginia's cause by no means to be despised. We understand that tho corps contemplate increasing its numbers to one hundred, and we advise those of our young men who are imbued with a correct and commendable military spirit to enrol their names upou the list of the new company. Regimental Court.?The Regimental Court of the 175th Regiment, met at the Gun-IIou-e, yesterday afternoon, at 3 o' clock, Col. Chas. E. Stuart in the chair. Lieut. Col. II. C. Dorsey, Maj. Geo. Duf fey and Capt. I). It. Srnoot appeared and took the oaths required by law. The usual allowance for music was made. A number of persons wore excused from mi litia service, on account of physical disabil ity. Reports from the various. Fire Companies were received, and it was determined not to exempt the firemen from fines. The Court were very rigid in enforcing fines upon commissioned officer?. After ex amining tho Sheriff's return of delinquent fines, the Court at a late hour adjourned. Mail Failure.?The Northern mail train arrived in Washington behind time yester day morning, and the omnibuses and mail wagon, consequently failed to connect at the Washington wharf with the steamer George Page. The vehicles thcu started by the Alexandria and Washington Turnpike, but were detained at the draw of the Long Bridge by the passing through of a fleet of long boats, and arrived in this city too late to connect with the Orange and Alexandria cars. The Southern and Southwestern mail, consequently, laid over in this city, the mail pouches being deposited at the Post Office. The Canal Board.?At a meeting of the commissioners of public works of Mary land, held in Washington, on Thursday, at the office of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, tho following gentlemen were elected President and Directors of that work, to serve until their successors shall j take their place, viz:?President, Dr. J. Fitzpatrick, Cumberland. Directors, Alfred Spates, Alleghany county; Victor Holmes, Baltimore county; J. j. Ileckart, Cecil county; Edward Mealy, Hagerstown; Col. John John?on, Martinsburg, Va.; Robert Vandiver, Harford county, Md. Alarm of Firk.?The alarm, of fire about eight o'clock, last night-, was caused by an incendiary attempt upon the residence of Mr. Joseph Hunter, at the comer of Water and Wilkes street. A pile of wood in the cellar was tired, and uot extinguished with out considerable effort on tho part of the fire men. Happily not much injury was done, but the want ol water and of water-plugs was rendered apparent to every spectator. Cattle.?A lot of beefcattle from Pulaski county was shipped on Thursday fr >m Lynch burg over the Orange and Alexandria rail road. for the Baltimore market. This is the firwt lot of cattle which has sought this route to market from the Western portion of the State, hut the communication now being so direct, large numbers will doubtless hereaf ter bo shipped over this route from Western counties. Fair.?The ladies' fair for the benefit of the Mount Vernon Guards commences at Sarepta Hall on Monday night. The hall has been beautifully and tastefully decorated, and a number of pretty and useful articles will be on exhibition. As the object of this fair is a commendable one, we trust it may meet with success. The Civil Docket.?The civil docket of the Quarterly term of the Alexandria Coun ty Court is fillingup rapidly, and'the Rum ber of new suits entered for the next term will probably be double the number at any term during the prcsont year. The Court meets on the 1st Monday in January next. Free Xeoroks.?During the month of No vember, there was no addition whatever to the free negro Registry of this county.? Of late very tew free negroes have been reg istered. ; J I860. A L M A ."M A C''. 1860. TVVKI.l'TH

THE GAZETTE'S SPECIAL DISPATCH. Washington, Dec. 7.?It is said here, upun excellent authority, that, numbers of prominent friends of the Union are now on the way hither, and that before Monday next will have gathered in this city.. This gathering composed of men such as Wash ington Hunt, Edward Everett, Caleb Gush ing, and Franklin Pierce, will use its influ ence in behalf of some conciliatory measure: either the report of the Boteler Committee I ?a new measure, to be brought forward by ! Crittenden, of Kentucky, under Powell's ; resolution?the latter retiring to give place to Crittenden?or if all fails?to carry out the plan recommended by the National In telligencer as follows:?"The assembling, at an early day, of a Convention or Congress of Delegates, who shall be appointed by the several Slaveholding States, in such number and in such way as shall be deemed most expedient." A prominent Northern gentlemau holding lately the most confidential relations with the Administration, expresses the opinion that if the South will present a united front and delay secession for a few months, they can obtain every guarantee of their consti tutional rights, which they may demand of the North. It is rumored that the Boteler Committee will endeavor to report on Monday, so as to get rid of the question of excusing Haw kins, of Florida, Boyce, of South Carolina, and other Southern members, who it is said, will demand to be excused, and thus complicate matters still further. It is, also, said that the Democrats of the Senate have not held a caucus, this session, for the reason that some of the Senators de cline to recognize Mr. Douglas as a Demo crat, whilst others declare that they will not go into caucus, unless he is admitted. the associated press dispatch. The Editorial in the Intelligencer of this morning recommending the Calling of a Con vention of all the slaveholding States, for the purpose of mutual consultation in respect a like to the dangers believed to be impending and the remedy deemed moat adequate to ar rest them, is said to be indicative of the plan now maturing here to effect this object. Southerners express great dissatisfaction with the Committee, which they say was formed by Abolitionists'advice, and three, if not five, States will not be represented. Penn sylvania members are sati&fied with the ap pointment of Campbell. The Southern Senators have decided to meet on Saturday for consultation. Northern members say, if secession is a fixed face, all attempts to compromise are useless. Mr. Seward will speak on the great bridge case, in the Supreme Court, on Saturday.? A State-rights-side argument, it is thought, will be taken by him. It is, however, pretty certain that no gen tleman from the five "cotton States" will consent to serve on the committee, which is an indication that the Representative's of those States, at least, are in favor of secession. District Attorney Quid has not yet band ed in his report on the charges preferred against Col. Selden, Marshal of the Dis trict. 

I.A.TES FROM EUROPE. New York, Dec. 7.?The steamer Asin, from Liverpool, on the 24th ultimo, "with Queenstown dates to the 2oth ult., has ar rived. The steamers Enropa and Bohemian had arrived out.

Consols 93J @93^. The Gaorgia and South Carolina Conventiona. Charleston, Dec. 6.?The Georgia senate has rejected the bill calling a convention of the Southern States. This is received as an indication of the intention of Georgia to se cede separately. The election for delegates to the South Carolina convention was a quiet one. Avery full vote was polled. The result will not be known till to-morrow. It is generally con ceded that Judge Magrath will lead the tick et. W. Porcher Miles, it is also conceded, is elected. There is a rumor on the streets to-day that the federal government is engaging laborers for Fort Moultrie, and drilling them as re oruits. Secession Movement in Texas. New Orleans, Dec.-7.?Mr. Stewart, as member of the Texas Legislature from Gon zales, has issued a circular in accordance with the resolutions published, calling a meet ing to be held at that placr, an.d inviting members to be at Austin on tue 3d Monday of Dec. to hold an extra session and call a State Convention. The Lone Star flag continues to be raised, and the people are united as to resistance to Lincoln's Administration. Gov. Houston promises to resign if the peo ple- make a demand for an extra session of the Legislature. The Secession Feeling in Florida. Charleston', Dec. G.?Senator Yulee, ol Florida, has written a letter from Washing ton to the legislature of that state, announc ing that upon learning at any time of the de termination of Florida to dissolve connection with the Northern States, lie will promptly and joyously return home to support the ban ner of the state to which he owes allegiance. Col. Blackburn, federal marshal for the northern district ot Florida, is closing up his business preparatory to resigning. The secession feeling in Florida i* quitoas universal as in South Caroline. The Remains of Gen. Wa. Walker. Augusta, Dec. 7.?The Mobile Register of of the4th. announces the return ofCapt. West from Truxillo, whither he went to obt tin the remains of Ge", Win. Walker.
