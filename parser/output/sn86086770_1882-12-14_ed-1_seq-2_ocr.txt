Cult and Stolen' Washington, Dec. 4 It is provided by tic. eonslitminn that Ihe president shall, fr.m tim t' in time, i re eon-ms information of the s'a’e 1 1 .he unio.l and recommend to thei- con,(deration such moasi’-cs *j he shall judge nece a y and ex pedient. OUR 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. In rer.cw.mr the even s of the year which has clapped since the commencement of the p-orem session, 1 feel gratified in cnP'ng your attention ir the condition of our foreign affairs. Our in tercourse with other powers hsi continued to bo of the most friendly character Such slight differences as have arisen du'iaj; the year, have been already settled or likely to .each an earlv adjustment. Tho a e t of, citixens of the United Stater in Ireland, under thci icccnt laws which owed their origin to the dis turbed condition of that country, has led io i •omewhat extended correspondence with the gov ernment of (Ireat Britain, and a disposition Ic reriiect our rights has been practically manifest ed by tho release of the arrested pc-ties. THE ISTHMUS CANAL. The claim of the nation in regard t. the tu■ per vision and control of nny inter-oceanic canal across tho American isthmuhas continued to he the subject of conference. It h likely that ''ire will be urnre powerful than discussion in remov ing tho divergence between the two nations whoso friendship is so closely connected by the intimacy of their relation: and community of their interest. Our bong established friendliness with Russia has remained unbroken. It has prompted toe to proffer tbo earnest Counsel of thu government that measures bo adopted for suppressing tlie proscription which the Hebrew race in that country has lately suffered. It has nut tran spired that any American citizen has beou sub jected to injury, and our.cuu'icons remonstrance has nevertheless been courteously received. There is reason in the belie! that the lltuo is not tar dis'ant when Russia sell bo able to secure toleration of all faiths within her border. INTERNATIONAL TRADE MARKS. At an international convention held in Paris in 1830. and attended by representatives ol the United H ates, an agreement wax reached in re spect to the protection t trade marks on patent ed articles and rights of manufacturing firms, and the co-operation of scientists in the adoption of a common meter to measure electric force. In view of the frequent occurrence of confer ences for the consideration f important matters of common in'erest to civi ired nations, I r. spectfully ajggisi that tho executive bn invested by congress with discretionary power to send delegates to (non conventions, and that pro vision be made to defray expenses Incident thereto. TROUBLE WITH SPAIN. The difference between the United State* and Spain as to the effect of a jadgment and a cer< tifieate of naturalization has not yet he m adjufl cd, but it is hoped and believed negotiations now in progress will result in the establishment of a position which seems to this government, reason able and just. I h.-rre alremty c.'dio 'f (he aTOffttSli ofCotigro - to tho fact that in tin) porta of Spain and its col onies fees have lately been imposed upon vessels of the United States for trivial offenses against local regulations. Effort! lor the abatement of these exactions have thus far proved unsuccess fill. 1 regret to inform you also that tho fees de manded by Spanish consulsiu American ports are in sumo cases so large when compered with ti e value ol the cargo as to amount, in effect, to a considerable export duty, and that our remon ilranras in this regard have not as yet rccclvi I attention whine ti ey dc-crv 1 it. GERMAN INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION. The German government has invited the I Stales to participate in hu i ilcrnatlonal exhibi tion of domestic cattle, to bo held ' a Hamburg, in July, 1888. If th ; s Country il to bo repre footed, it is important that in the early days ol this session, congress should make an approp-i --ution for that purpose. ITALY. Tho death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to Italy, has evoked from that government ex pressions of profound respect tor his exalted character and tor his honorable care in the diplo matic service of his country. Ihe Italian gov irnmcnt has raised a question tut to tho propiietv at recognizing in his dusl capacity tho repro sentativo ot this country recently accredited both as secretary of legation and a- consul-general el Rome. He has been received s< secretary, bu. hts exequatur as consul-general b v thus In been wilhhcld -lIEU*DM. The extradition convention with Belgium, which has been in operation since I ''Tt, Ins been atcly supplemented by another, 'the senate has vgniQed its approval and ratifications have been luty exchanged between the contracting coun tries. To the list of extraditable crimes has been added that of assassination or attempted assess,- t alien e! the chief at state. SWITZERLAND. Negotiation* have been opened with Fwitzor tand looking to a settlement by treaty of the question whether its citizens can renounce their allegiance* and become citizens of the United States. lam happy to inform you that the im migration of paupers and criminals from certain of the cantons of Bwitzcrlard have substantially ceased and is no longer sanctioned by the au thottie . The consideration of tlri subject prompts the suggestion that the act of August dd, ISS2, which has for its object the return of f.rctgn eonvic ■■ to (Mr mail counhy. should be so modified as n ; to ho open to fraud. 1- aff.v . tke extradition of critr'naU on prefe. ed charge! of crime. TH* OTTOMAN pout a has not yet r-son ted to the interpretation which this government ha* put up n the treaty of 1830, relative to its jurisdictions' right* in Tu-key. it may well be said, however, ilia, tips diffe-enee will be adjusted by u general revision of the sys tem of jurisdiction of the United States in the Coonnea of ibe east. a subject to which you- at tention has be n already called by the secretary of state. CHINESE INDEMNITY EC SO. In the interest of justice toward Chinn and Japan, I trust that the question of the return of the indemnity fund to tie governments of those countries will he reached at the present sea on, and the satisfactory soluth n made which I have already recommended and which has recently been foicshadowcd hy congress. 

COREA. The treaty lately concluded with Corea aw .its the action of the senate. EGYPT. During the late disturbance in Kgrpl, the timely presence of American vessels servei a- protection to the persons and property ol many ot our own citiiens and of citlaens ot o t, r rountriei whose governments have expressed th.,r thauhs for this aasistance. THE CHINESE UCEST.ON. The recent legislation restricting immigration (f laborers from China has given ise to the question of whether Chinese proceeding to and from another country may lawfully pass through . itr own. In construing the art of May 6th ISS2, in connection with the treaty of Nov. 7th, 1880, the restriction would seem to be limited to Chinese immigrants coming to the I’nited Stabs a laborers, and should no: 'orbi t a mere transit across our territory. I a-ii the a’tention ot c’ - g; c. ■to the subject for such action, if any, as miy be deemed advisable. LIBERIA. Thi* government has recently had occasion to manifest interest in the republic of Liberia by seeking to ah*, the amicable settlement of the l*)undary dispute now pacing between tha* re public and the British potsesion of Sierro Le n HAWAII. The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will be come terminated after September U, 18S3, two months notice by either party. While certain provisions of that * compact may have proved .my < nemos, its existence has fostered com mercial relations which it i. important to pre serve. 1 suggest, therefore, that early conirdera tion be given to such modification of the treaty as seem to bo demanded by the interests of our people. JhAYTI AND ban DOMINGO. In view of our increasing trade with both liny ti an 1 San Domingo, I advise that provision he made for diplomatic intercmr°o with the latter by enlarging the scope of the mission at Port au Prince. I regret that a certain class of Ameri can citizens arrayed against the government of Ilayti, have thus far been urged unavailingly tc desist. MEXICO. A recent agreement with Mexico provides f* r the crossing of the frontier by the armed forces <d either country in pursuit <-f h*tile Indians. In my message last year I called attention to the prevalent lawlessness on the borde-a and to tho r '■ Py of legislation lor its luppreyrion. I • gain invite the attention of congress to the sub ject. A partial relief from these mischiefs ha# been sought in a convention which now has the approval of the senate and awaits fa th.jp action, is does another touching the establishment of the international boundary between the United S r ttes and Mexic >. If the latter is raided the action of congress will be r* -juired f<r e/aibiish ing suitable commi-'sions -i urvey. The botttd ary dispute bctw.cn Mexico and GuaUmala, which led this government to proffer its friendly counsel to both parties, has been amicably set tled. ■Vejcczctela. No change has occurred in our relations with Venezuela. I again inv ’ • your action to the matter of the pending awn* s against that repub lic to which reference was made by a special mes sage from the executive aty mr U*t session. An invitation Ins been received from the government of Venezuela to send r proseatatives in July. 1883 to participate in the Centennial celebration of tne birth of Bolivar, the founder of South American independence. In connection with the '■vent, il is designed to commemorate the erection at C.in Mile.' of a statute • t Washington and to •ondurt an industrial exhibition which will be I'-nfo American products. I rc|uc*t that the United State* bo repns ntc>t and that miiable .provision bo luido therefor. CENTRAL AMERICA. Th ■ elf.ation -d turnip ion in • *it al Amer ica, the plenipotentiary rank of which w.is a t thorifed by congress at Us Ute so .on, has been sinew effiCted. PERU, BOLIVIA AND CHILI. The war between Peru and Bolivia on the ont slop, an I Chili cntiie other, began more than! .wo years ago by the occupation by Chili in ISBO of all the lattcral territory of Bolivia. Ne gotiation- for peace were conducted under the direction of the United States. The others re fused to concede any territory, but Chili has since become master of the whole coast el both countries and of the capitol of Peru. A year since, as you have already been advised by correspondence transmitted, to you in January lasi, this government sent at special mission to the bal.ggerant powers (o ix-j press the bops that Chili would bo disposed to ac-J crpt a money indemnity for the expenses of the* war and to relinquish her demand for a portion of the territory for her antagonist. This recom mendation. which Chili declined to follow, this, government did not assume to enforce nor can it he enforced without resort to measures which would be in keeping neither with the temper of our people nor wilhi the spirit of our institutions. The power of Peru no longer extends over its whole territory, and in the event of onr interference to dictate peace, it would need tt be supplemented by the army and navy of the United States. Sack in terference would almost inevitably lead to the establishment of a protectorate, result utterly at odds with ou- past policy, injurious to our present interests, and lull ol .embarrassments for the fu'.UW ftir.Um toxuiina-. lion of hostilities on towns, at once, just to Iho victorious nation,and generous to its adversarie l . This government has spared no effort a to save such as might involve the complications which I have indicated, it is greatly to bo deplored that Chili seems resolved to exact such rigorous condi tions ol peace and is indisposed to submit to arbi tration the terms of an amicable settlement. No peace is likely to bo lasting that is not sufficiently equitable and just to command the approval of ythcr nations. 

WASHINGTON PEACE CONFERENCE. About a year since invitations wore extended the nations of this continent to send representa tive! to a peace congress to assemble at Wash ington in November, 1882. The time of meeting was fixed at a period then remote in the hope, as the invitation itself declared, that in the mean time the disturbances between South American republics would bo adjusted. As that expeota .ion seemed unlikely t bo realized, 1 asked in April lost for an expression of opinion from ttie two bosses of congress, as to the ad visability of bolding the convention at the time appointed. This action was prompted in part by doubts which mature reflection bad suggested, whether diplomatic usage and the traditions of the government did mu make it titling that the executive should eonsutt the representatives of the people before pur. uing a brie of policy some what novel in its character and tar reaching in its possible consequences. In view of the fact that no action was taken by congress in the premises, and no provision bad been made for necessary expenses, I subsequently decided to postpone the Iconvuoati n nod so notified the several governments winch had been invited to attend. lam unwilling to dismiss this subject without assuring you of my support ot any measures congress way devise for the promotion of peace on this continent, and throughout the world, and I trust that the time is near, when with the universal a-sent of civilised people, all international difference* will be determined with out resort to arms by the benignant process ot arbitration. retirement op a a M v oFFtcr.as. Th- eerelaiy of war calls at ention to the fact tin' an embarrassment growing cut of there .•cut a"t of congress, making 'he retirement o' officers of the nrmv compulsory at the age of fit, with th • ac of 1878, is still in iorce, which him • to four hundred the number ot those who can be retired f "r disability or up u their own applica tion. The two acts, when construed ogelher. seam to forbid the retiring, even lor absolute in capacity, ot officers who do not fall within ths purview of the Utter statute, at such times as there chance to be loss than dOO names on th". retired list. There are now 420. It is not likely that congress intended this result, and I concur with the secretary that the law ought to he amended. PiriOMATIC CHANGES. Changes have occurred iu the diploma'ic repre ■entation of several foreign powers during the past year. New ministers trim the Argentine. Republic, Austria, Hungary, Brasil, Chili, China France, Japan, Mexico, ilie Netherlands nod I’rus ;a have presented their credent.ale. The missions of Benmark. and ot Venexuela at this capital have been raised in gr ide. Switzerland has ereatftl a plenipotentiary mission to this p int, and an embassy from Madagascar and a minister from Spain wi 1 sh wily ar rive. Oar diplomatic intercourse has been enlarged by the establishment ot relatiois with I lie new kingdom ut S nit, by the c-eati n ot a mission It Siam and by the restoration of the mission to Ur,v c. The Shah ol i’ersis has expressed his gratification that a charge d‘ alf lira will shortly be sent to that country whrre the lights of of our citizens have been courteously guarded by the representatives of Ureal Britain. COLLISIONS AT SK.S. 1 renew my recommendation of su-h legisla tion as will place the United States in harmony with other powers in respect to international rules for the prevention of cvllirnoi * at tea. In conformity with your joint re olution ol the 3d nf August last, I have directed the secretary of date to address foreign governments in respect *.o a propose 1 conferva.' • t w cm- I ring the subject of the uiv e--.il a 1 >p;ion of a common prime .meridian : li used iu the reckoning and longitude and the regu ition ot time throughout ihe civilized w orld. Their replies will, in due lime, be laid before v..a. INTERCHANGE 01 NATIONAL D )CL M ENTS. Anagr . rornt was reached at Baris, in 18/5, betw-cn the principal fur the interchange of/Beial publications through the medium • ( it heir respective fore ign departments. Thia ad ftuirablc custom, which has been built up by i he enlerpri-eof the Smithsonian institute, offe-ed i u practical basis for our co-operation in this I tchcme, and an arrangement has been effected by i which that institution will perform the necessary j labor by direction of the department of state A reasonable compeimtion therefor should be provided by law. THE DIPLOMATIC BEBVICE. A clause of theact making appropriations for the diplomatic and consular service, contemplates the reorganization of both brancncs of such ser vice on a salaried basis, leaving fees to inure to the benefit of the treasury. I cordially farot such a project as likely to norrect abuses in the present system. The secretary ot state will pre sent to you at an early date, a plan for such or ganization. THI

The matter has already been the sul j .-t of disco sion in the senate and a bill which socks in supply the deficiencies of existing laws is non o.i its calendar. ;tue AGRICULTURAL DUSEAR. The report of the. commissioner of agriculture presents nn account of tho labors of that depart ment during the past year, and includes informa tion of much interest to the general public. The condition of tho forests of the country and the wasteful manner in which their destruction is taking place, gives cause for serious apprehension. Their action in pro tecting the earth’s surface in modifying the extr- .nos of climate and regulating and sus taining the flow of springs sad streams, js not well understood and their importance in relation to the growth and prosperity of the country can not be safely disregarded. 'They' are fast disap pearing belore destructive fires and the legitimate requirements .if our increasing population and their total extinction cannot be long delayed, un less better methods than now prevail shall be adopted for their protection and cultivation. The attention of congress is called to the necessity of additional legislation to preserve valuable forests still remaining on tbo public di main, .specially n the extreme western states and territories, where tho necessity for their preservation is greater than in less moun tainous regions, and where tbo prevailing dry - ness of the climate renders restoration, it they i are ones destroyed, well nigh impossible. NATIONAL I'ANKS. 1 During the year tin J have been organised 171 • •lend bunks a.td of 'I;- institutions there re now in , ) oration 2 269 r ii.-ger number than tvirbi'orv. fit' value of their note* inactive .cubit l n on July Ist 1882, t* $124,006 4.58. I recommend to your allcn’hm the secretary’s i iews in respt et to the likelihood (fa serious c n ’notion of this circulation, and the modes bs which tha. remit may be in his judgment SILVER CERTIFIi VTF.B AND CMS ROE <T SILVER. In respect to the coinage cf silver dol srs and ■be retiument of tTver'eertifi.Mtes, I have seen ■nothing to a'ter. but much to confirm the senti i.etits to which 1 gate expression last year. A eomparts n between the respective amounts of >cr u 'I as circttlati. a on November, 1881, and u V v other 1882, shows a slight increase of a mi!.ion n. and a hall dollar-, but during the inter vai there had been in the whole number coined at. increase of twenty-six millions of the one hgndrel ana twenty-eight millions thus tor tu 'ed. A little more than thirty five r tons are in circulation. The mass ,} accumulated coin has grown so great that 'h vault room at present available foe stor age is scarcely sufficient to contain it. It is not appa-eiit why it U desirable to continue the coin age now so enormously in excess of public de mand. As to tie silver certificates, in addition to the gn-unds which seemed last year to justify their r, lirement. max be menti m and the effect which is l.kfiv to ensue from the supply . g i<i certificates, for the ssuince of which congress recently made provision, and which are new in active circulation, THE 

REDUCTION OF REVENUES. You cannot fail to note with interest the dis cussion by the secretary ai to the necessity id providing by legislation some mode of freeing the trea-ury of an excess of assets in he event that congri -s fails to reach an early agreement for the leluction of taxation. I hereby approve the secretary's recommendation f an imnediatc and extensive reduction in the annual revenues of the government. It will be remembered that I urged upon congress at its las. session the im-. portanci of relieving the industry ami cate-prise ■ of the country from the prc--ure of unnecessary taxation It >s one of the truest maxims of polit ical economv that all taxes a e burdensome, however; wDc'y and prudently imposed, and though there have always been among our peo ple widi ciiffsrence.y of smiiment as to the best method' of raising the national revenue, and in deed a- to the principles upon which taxation should be based there ins b.-en substantial accord if, the doctrine that only such taxes ought to be levied es are necessary for the wise and eoonomi oil aJtninistialien of government. Of late the public revenue* have exceeds 1 that limit, and un ie?.' ch-cked py appropriate Irgislatiop, such cx ce-s will continue to increase fn in year to year For the fiscal year end • 1 June Hath, ISSI. thus surplus was more than $145,000,000. The report of the secretary shows what disposition has been made of these moneys. They have not only au swired the requi ements of the sinking fund but have afforded a large balance applicable to other reducli ns of the public debt. But I renew the expression of the conviction that such -apid ex tinguishment of the national indebtedness as is now taking place is by bo means a cause tor con gratulations. 1; t< a came rather for ath us ap pr, hension. If it coot nues, it must fpe-dily,-be (followed by one of th ,se evil results so clearly set forth in the report of the secretary; either the surplus must be idle in the treasury, or the government will bo forced to buy at market rales tts bonds not then redeemable, and which, under such circum stances, cannot fail to command an enormous premium; or the smaller revenues will be devoted to extravagant expenditures which, a? experi ence has taught us, is over the bane of the over flowing treasury. It was made apparent in the course of the an imated diseu'-i n which this question aroused at the las: seas lon of cong es that the policy ot diminish ng the revenuj by reducing taxation cemmanded g<ncrul aptmv il of the members of botii lnu-cu I regret that b cause of the conflict ions as to the best metln ds by which that policy should bo made operative more of its benefits have not be cn reaped. In fulfilllment of what I deem my constitutional duty, but with little hope that I can make valuable contribution to this vexed question, I shad proceed to intimato britfly my own view.. in relation to it. PBEsiniNw Arthur’s plan for reducing TAXATION. llpon the showing of our Pifiancial condition at the close of tbe lari fiscal year, I felt justified in re ommendiog to congress ihc abolition of inter nal revo nnc, cxi cpt Itha upon tobacco in its va nou- forms and upon eli-. tiled spirits un i Irr u.cited ■! i t ami except also the spenal tax upon the manufacturer and dealer.-in such a ni nes. 1 vupiirc now to suggest that unless it shall be a- ai tainted that the probable expendi tures of the government f r the coming jear Laic li in under estimated 'he intend taxes, save those which relate to distilled spirits, can bo pm dmlly abrogated. Such n r, oi non, accompanied by a simplifica tion of the machines of collection, which would then be easy of accomplishment, might reason ably be expected to result in diminishing the cost ol ruch collection by a: least two millions and a half of dollars nnd in the retirement from office frvtn 1,501) to 2,000 persons. The system of ex cise duties has never commended itself to the fa vor of the American people, and has never been resorted to except for supplying deli iencies in the treasury, when, by rca-on of special esrgen oii!, the duties on imports have proved inade quate to Ihc needs ol the government. The sjnlim rat of the country doubtless oom metidatlie present excise law shall be abolished ai soon as traeheourse can safely be pursued. It seems to me, however, for various reasons, so sweeping a measure, ai the total abolition oi in to nil tax, would for the pre-ont be an unwise step. Two ot these reasons are deserving of special mention: First, it is by no means clear that even if the existing system of duties oi imports as contin ued without modification, that those duties alone will yield sufficient levcnue for all the needs of I lie government- 1: is is' iinatod Gnu one hun dred millions of dollars will be required for pensions during the coining year, and it may we 1 be doubted whether the maximum annual de mand fur that object has yet been reached. Un certainty upon (Ms question would alone justify in my judgment Ilia retention for the present of that portion of the system of internal revenue which is least objectionable to the people. Ktcood, a total abolition of excise taxes would almost prove a serious, if not unsunnount able, objection to a thorough revision of the tariff, ami to any consider able reduction in im port duties. THE 

PRESENT TARIFF BVBTEM in, in many respects unjust. It makes an une qual distribution both of its burdens and its benefits. This fact was especially r> cognized by a majority of each house of oongress*in the pas sage of .bo act creating tbo tarifl' commission. The report of that commission will bo placed be fore you at the beginning of fids session and will, I trust, afford you such information m to the condition and prospects of the various commer cial, agricultural, mining, manufacturing and ether interests of the country, and contain such suggestions lor statutsry revision as will practi cally aid your action upon th ! s important subject. The revenue from customs for the fiscal year ending Juno 31), 1871), amounted to $137,600,000. It has in the three succeeding years reached frst. $186,000,000, then $198,000,000, and final ly, as has been already stated, $210,000,000. The income from this servico (or the fiscal yvor which will end in June 30th, 1883,.wi1l doubtless l>e considerably in excess of the sum last men tioned. If the tax on domestic spiiita is to be retailed, it is plain, therefore, that large reduc tions from the customs revenue are entirely feasi ble. While recommending this reduction, I am tar from advising the abandonment of the policy if Ji.-c r; m ; naiing in the adjustment of the detail to ss to aff .ru aid and protection to domestic labor.

Without entering into minute details which, und.r present circumstances, is quiie unnecessary, I recommend an en'argemvnt of the free list so a? to include within it the numerous articles which yield considerable revenue, a simplification t the complex anti inconsistent schedule of duties upon certain manufactures, and particu larly those upon cotton, ir-n and steel, and a substantial reduction of duties upon those ar ticles, and upon sugar, no l.i-scs, silk, wool and we len goods.

RIVER AND H ARDOR BILLS. The grounds that induced mo to withhold my signature from the bill entitled ; "An act mak ing appropriations for the construction, repair and preservation of certain works on rivers and ha-bora,” which became a law near the close of yi ur ses ion, prompt me to express the opinion that no ■ imilar mea-ure will be deemed necessary during the present session of congress. Indeed, such a measure would now be open to a serious objection in addition to that which was lately urged on your attention. lam informed by the secretary of war that the greater portion oi ho sum appropriated lor the various items specified in that act remains unexpended. The new works, for which authorized expenses have been incurred, are only two, for which the total ap propriation was $210,000. The present available halanr-e is and so'osed by the following tables: Am unt of appprouriatiun by net of August 2,1882 $18,733,875 Amount of appropriation by act of June 19. 1882 10.000 Amount id appropriati >n lor payments to J. 11. Eads 304,000 Unexpended ba'nnco of formtr appropriation 4,738,263 Total 23,791,138 1/ as amount drawn from treas ury between July 1,1882, and November 30, 1882 6,1-56.191 Total 17,734,914 It is apparent by this exhibit that so far . f concerns most of the items to which the act ■ t August 2nd, 1382 relates, there can be no need > further appropriations until after the close oft) e present session. If, however, any action should be noce svry in respect) to particular objects it would be entirely feasible to provide fur those ob jects by appropriate legislation, It is possible , lor example, that a delay until the assembling ol the next congress to make additional p-nv'son for the Mississippi river improve ment might be attended with serious con sequences. If such ehou'd appear to be the ca.-e, a just bill relating to that subject would command my approval. This leads mo to offer a suggestion which 1 trust will commend itself to the wisdom of congress. Is it not advisable that the grants of large sums of money (or divers and indepen lent schemes of internal improvement should be ma 1c the subjects of soparat ,• and dis-' tinct legi-lati-.o enactments. It will hardly be gainsaid even by those who favor the most liberal expenditures for such purposes as are sough to be accomplnhe J by what is commonly called the river and hailo r bill, that the practice ot group ing in such i bill appropriations for a great di versity of objects widely f opr rated cither in their nature . r the locality with which they are con cerned, or in both, as one which is ranch to be deprecated, ns its inevitable tendency is to seeme the success of the bill as a whole, though many of the items, if separably considered, could scare j- Iv fail of rejection. I!y the adoption of the course I have recommended, every member of congress when an opportunity should arise (for giving his influence and vote for meritorious appropriations, would be enabled so to do without being called upon to sanction others undeserving of his ap proval. So, also, would the executive be afforded full oppottunity to exercise his constitutional pre rogative of opposing whatever appropriations seemed to him objectionable, without imperilling the success of others which commended themselves to his judgment. It may bo urged in opposition to these suggestions that the number of works of internal improvement which are justly entitled to govt rntncntal aid is so groat as to render imprac ticable separate appropriation bills therefor, aid even for sach comparatively limited number as make disposition of largo sums of money. This bjoclion may be well founded, and whether it be II not, the advantages that would be likely t > ensue by the adoption of the course 1 have re commended may perhaps bo more effectually at tained by another which I respectfully submit in congress as an alternative proposition. It is providedby the constitutions of 1-4 of our -tales that the executive may disapprove am item or items of a bill appropriating money whermp' u part of tbe bill approved shall be law and the part disapproved shall fail to bee-m law, unless repas-cd, according to the provisim prescribed tor the pa-sago ol bills i vor the vet. of the executive. The states wherein some sucf provisions, as the foregoing, is a fundamental law, are Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, I.Tiiisiana, M's-inri Nchnska, New Jirsey New York Pen i A ani l and West Virginia.

The officers and crew, aftm a journey over the ice, embarked in three boats for the cjasts of Siberia. One of the parties under the c tnmand of Chief Engineer George W. Melville, reached the land nnd falling in with natives was saved. Another under Lieutenant Commander Do Long, landed in a barren cgion near the mouth ol the Lena river. After six weeks had elapsed, all but two of the number had ebed from fatigue and starvation. No tidi igs have Icon re ceived frem the pa-tv in the third boat under the co ninand of Lieut.

Lieutenant Berry and one ot his officers after making a search for the Jeannette along the cast of Siberia, fell in with Ch ef Engineer Melville's party, and returned home by way of Europe.

It appears by the secretary’s report that the AVAILABLE NAVAL FORCE of the T'nii and States consists of thirty-seven .•rubers, four single-turretcd monitors built dur ing the rebellion, a large number of smooth bore gun& arul pu'Tot rifles, and highly-seven rifle * :annon.

The secretary 1- r< ihlr depicts the intimate connection and interdependence of THEN ATT AND THE COMMERCIAL MARINE, jr.J invites attention to the continued decadence of the la'ter and the corresponding transfer of our g-owing commerce to foreign bottoms. This .abject is one of the utmost importance to the rational welfare. Methods of reviving American ship building and of restoring the United States ll.ig cn the ocean carrying trade should receive the immediate attention if congress. Wo have mechanical skill and ahunda at material for the manufacture of modern iron steamships in fairi ■rmpetition with our commercial rivals. Our dis ■ dvantage in building ships is the greater cost of Hh rand sailing them, high tax and greater in terest on capital. While the ocean highways are Already monopolised by cur formid able competitors, these obstacles should m pome way he overcome, and for rapid commu nication with foreign lands nc should not continue to depend wholly on vessels built in the yards of • ther countries and sailing under foreign flags. With no United States steamer on the nrincip.il '■■can lines, or for any foreign parte, our facili ties for extending our commerce are greatly re •trieted, while the nations which build the ships .nd carry the mail and passengers, obtain there by conspicuous advantages in increasing .heir trade. REDUCTION cr LETTER POSTAGE. At the last session ot congress several bills were introduced into the house ot repr;snnta lives for the redaction of letter postage ••> tho rale of two cents per ■ ne-half ounce. I have given much study and reflection to this subject, and am thoroughly persuaded that such a re duction would be for the best interests of the public, ft lias been the policy of the govern ment, from t foundation, t- defray, as far as possible, the expense of carrying the mails by a direct tax in the form of postace. It liar never been claimed, however, that this service ought, to. be productive of a net revenue. As has been stated a'leady.'the report of tho post master general shows there is now a very consid erable surplus in his department, and that henceforth receipts are likely to increase in a much greater ratio than necessary expenditure. Un less some change is made in the existing jaws, the profits of the postal service will, in a very few years, swell the revenues of the government many millions of dollars. Tho time socma seemr auspicious, therefore, for s-uno reduction in rates of postage. In wh.it shall that reduc tion consist? A review o, the legislation wt.ioh has been had upon this subject during the last Vhirty vears discloses that domestic letters consti tute tho only class of mail matter which has never been favored with a substantia! reduction if rates. I am convinced that the burden of maintaining the services labs most unequally on that class, and that iau'o than ary either it is entitled to present relief. That such relief may nc extended without detrim,nt to other public in : e-rests veill be discovered by reviewing the results -f former reductions. Immediately prior to tho act of 

ISIS, the postage on a letter composed of a single sheet w as, vit: If conveyed thirty miles or less six cents, between thirty and eighty miles, 10 cents; between cghty nmi one hundred and fifty miles, J2> cents: between one hundred and •ilty and lour hundred miles, 13 \ coni,-; over four hundred miles, 23 cents. By tho act of ISIS tho postage on a tingle letter conveyed for any dis tance under 300 miles, was fixed at five cents, and for any greater distance It) cents. By the act of 1351, it was provided that a single letter if pre naid, should he carried any distance not exceed ing 300 miles for three c -nts, and any greater dis tance six cents. It will be noticed that both these reductions were of a radical character and relatively quite as important as that now pro p sed. la each case .there ensued a temporary I isa of revenue, but a sudden and large influx of h isiness which paid that loss in three pears Un less the eiferieme of past legislation m this "( untry and elsewhere goes for naught, it may be safely predicted that a stimulus of a fifty per cent, reduction tax for carriage would at once in crease the number of letters consigned to the mails. The advantages > f secrecy would lead to a very general substitution of sc.bc i packets f r post cards and open circulars, and in diveis 0 tier ways the volume of first class matter would be enormously augmented. Such an increase amounted in Kngland the first year after the adoption of a penny pos'agc to more than 125 per cent. As .he result of a careful estimate, the dctals 01 which i annot here be set out, I have become convinced that the deficiency for the Cr.-t year i tor tho proposed rcduc ion would not exceed seven nor cent, of expenditures, or $3,000 .000. while the deficiency alter the reduction of 1815 tVifS'fnorc than IT per"cent, an I alter that 185] t was 27 per cent. THE POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT. The report of the postmastergcneral gives evi dence of the satisfactory condition of that depart ment, and contains many valuable data and sug gestions which cannot fail to be of interest. The information which it affords, that tho receipts for the fiscal year have exceeded expenditures must be very gratifying to congress and to the people of tbe country. As matters which may fairly claim particular attention,!refer to his observation In reference to the advisability ot changing the P'csent basis for fixing salaries and allowances, of extending the money order system, of en larging the functions of postal establishments so as to place under its control the telegraph sys tem of tho country; though from this last and most important recommendation 1 must with held wy approval.
