These gray days are great (Jays in many' respects. The grass in the pastures and meadows and the win -er wheat and rye are growing long roots that will help to produce abun dant crops next summer. And these days afford an unusual opportunity to complete the work of the season, not alone on the farms but in the towns and cities. And they are giv ing the farmers' stock a chance to live in the corn stalks fields longer than ordinarily, and they are short aning the winter and saving fuel and discomforts of zero weather which we sometimes have before this time of the year. It is now upwVrds of three weeks since we have had even a freezing temperature. Is not that great for an Iowa November? CARD OF THANKS.

PRES. WILSON READS URGES PASSAGE OF FINANCIAL LEGISLATION FAVORABLE TO FARMERS. MEASURE OF INTEREST TO FARMERS Complete Text of What President Said on Money Question Now Before Congress.^ The following is an excerpt from President Wilson's message to con gress I present to you in addition the ur gent necessity that special provision be made also for facilitating the cred its needed by the farmers of the coun try. The pending currency bill does the farmers a great service. It puts them upon an equal footing with oth er business men and masters of en terprise, as, it should, and upon its passage they will find themselves quit of many of the difficulties which now hamper them in the field of credit. The farmers of course ask and should be given no special privil ege, such as extending to them the credit of the government itself. What tliey need and should obtain is legislation which will make their own abundant and substantial credit resources available as a foundation for joint, concerted, local action in their own behalf in getting the capi tal they must use. It is to this we should now address ourselves. It lias, singularly enough, come to pass that we have allowed the Indus try of our farms to lag behind the other activities of the country in its development. I need not stop to tell you how fundamental to the life of the nation is the production of its fSod. Our thoughts may ordinarily be con centrated upon the cities and the hives of industry, upon the cries of the crowded market place and the clangor of the factory, but it is from the quiet interspace of the open val leys and the free hillsides that we draw the sources of life and of pros perity, from the farm and the ranch from the forest and the mine. With out these every street would be si lent, every office deserted, every fac ory fallen Into disrepair. And yet the farmer dors not staud upon the same footing with the fores ter and the miner in the market of redit. He i.s the servant of the sea sons. Nature' determines how long he must wait for his crops anad will not be hurried in her processes. He may Sive his note, but the season of its maturity depends upon the season when his crop matures and lies at the gates of the markets where his products are sold. And the security ie gives is of a character not known in the broker's office or as fami'iar ly as it might be on the counter of the banker. The agricultural department of the government is seeking to assist as never before to make farming an effi cient business,of wide co-operativ.e ef fort, in quick touch with the markets for foodstuffs. The farmers and the government will henceforth work to gether as real partners in this field, where we ndw begin to see our way -llta:jUt Xuuiu OJ3l[A\ pun jfJSy! jent plans are already being put into sxecution. The treasury of the United States has .by a timely and well considered listribution of its deposits facilitated the moving of crops in the present •season and prevented the scarcity of available funds too often experienced at such times. But we must not allow ourselves to depend upon extraordi nary expedients. We must add the means by which the farmer may make his credit constantly and easily avail able and command when he will the capital by which to support and ex pand his business. We lag behind many other great countries of the mod ern world in attempting to do this. Systems of rural credit have been studied and developed on the other side of the water while we left our farmers to shift for themselves in tl^e ordinary money market. You have but to look %about ypu in any rural dis trict to see the result, the handicap and embarassment which have been nut upon those who produce our food. Conscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part, the congress re cently authorized the creation of a special commission to study the vari ous system.s^of rural credit which have been put in operation in Europe and this commission is a'ready prepared to report. Its report ought to make it easier for us to determine what meth ods will be best suited to our own .armers. I hope and believe that the committees of the senate and house will address themselves to this mat ter with the most fruitful results, and I believe the.studies and recently formed plans of the department of ag rioulture may be made to serve them very greatly in their work of framing appropriate and adequate legislation. It Would be indiscreet and presump tious in any one to dogmatize, upon so great and many sided a questioi but I feel confident that common com sel will produce the results we must all desire. —Alex. Born, who formely lived in Manchester, has rented his farm near Edgewood and will remove with his family to that place. In another col umn will be found an announcement of his sale to be held on Wednesday, .December 10.
