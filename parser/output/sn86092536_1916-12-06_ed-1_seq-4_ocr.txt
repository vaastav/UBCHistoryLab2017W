THE GREATER WRONG THAT IS IGNORED ! President Wilson in his agreeably short message to Congress lays stress j ?on rhe necessity for rhe passage of a corrupt practices act. regulating thej ?expenditure of money in elections, but it seem? to The Intelligencer rh.it < ^Senator Penrose's amendment to the Owen bill for federal supervision ofj .national elections is seeking to correct a more grevious national scandal than \ that suggested by *h?- {'resident. The purpose of the Penrose amendment is ; to secure the right of rhe negro to vote in the South. where ai present his ^suffrage privileges are suppressed. The Intelligencer recently called atten- ' 'tion to this great injustice by which the Southern States are held stolidly in the Democratic coiumn. The circumstances are familiar to all intelligent, readers. There was a great hue and cry raised by the managers of the Demo .cratic Presidential campaign about the alleged importation of negroes from the South for the purpose of being fraudulently voted in the close States, but tJhere was no voice raised against the greater iniquity practiced in the South where the negro voter is not allowed to exercise rights guaranteed him by the constitution. In fact, the Southern Democracy terrorizes a part of its white population. No law prevents a white man from voting the Republican 'ticket in the South, but public opinion restrains him. This outrageous condi -lion^Jias established an advantage for every Democratic candidate for Presi dent of 126 electoral votes, guaranteed him absolutely. The delivering of these votes through an election is a mere matter of form, wholly perfunctory. Mr. Wilson has professed to be very much concerned about "humanity." and in an exalted moment after the election he plead for "justice with a heart in it." Why, in the name of consistency, then, when he was asking for a corrupt practices act did he not at the same time demand Justice for t.he intimidated voter of the South? The answer is only too obvious. We do not entertain any hope thai Senator Penrose's amendment will pass, for the' South practically controls the Senate. But it seems that the time has arrived for one of two things to be done. -These Southern States ought to b?- deprived of a large number of electoral vote?. They have disfranchised the negro by one process or another: yet the negro is counted as a vot?*r and a man in the distribution of members of Congress and members of rh*- electoral college. The South ought, not to have the benefit of the negro in making up their rep resentation in Congress, or else rhey ought nut have power to disfranchise him. Here is a chance for President Wilson to put a great throbbing hear; in justice, to give some slight evidence of the sincerity of his professed high ideals. Will he do it? No. He always has and always will hit. the point of least resistance: and. further, because he is in uo sense a statesman but in ?eTery sense- a mere politician. 

AKIN TO INTIMIDATION The current issue of the Railway Age Gazette gives an interesting in sight into the controversy before the Interstate Commerce Commission concerning the proposed rale to adopt high power electric locomotive head lights on fh>> railroads of the country. There was such a conflict it: the tes rimony with regard to the increased safety and rhe increased danger that , the Commission took the matter tinder advisement without common:.. The in teresting development in the case waa the actioD of the Brotherhood of Lo comotive Engineers in warning any ot their members in testifying against "the installation of such light under pain of expulsion. It. was developed during the hearing that such a provis ion existed in the constitution of the .brotherhood, which show3 a remark able srate of affairs in that organiza tion. One engineer, however, braved 'the wrath of the brotherhood provision ? who said that he had voluntarily come '"to protect myself and rhe public .against tho enforced use of a device which means death.'' The counsel for the railroads scath- J inely denounced the brotherhood con stitution's provision providing that "any member who Interferes with a legislative matter being conducted by the legislative board sha.ll be expelled.' He called attention to the warnings sent broadcast to engineers that they f were subject to expulsion if they tes tified, and cited the case of David Trostle, an engineer who admitted un der oath that, while he was waiting to take the witness stand, Aionzo n. Park assisrant chief Inspector on rhe gov ??rnm^nr staff of Frank McManaray. had "reminded him of fhe brotherhood rule that he ro?iM he expelled for in terfering in legislative matters," even within i Jit* hearing chaufber ot the in terstate Commerce Commission.. With the testimony of the brotherhood wit-] n esses so directly contradictory of -rill j the mass of testimony of engineers f.nd others who testified of difficulties j in vision through falsu color?, reflec tions and blinding glare from the high power lights, as produced by the rail roads. the two could not be reconciled i and it resolved itself into a matter of the credibility of the witness, with re gard to which the Commission has ve served its decision. It was significant that at the close of the hearing the statement was made that the brother- j hood chiefs, in expelling engineer- j from membership for testifying to ! their belief that, the electric headlight.- ; are dangerous, had violated the Fed- , eral penal code. which prescribes n , fine of sr>.(Vift and six years' 1mpris-j onment for intimidation or wrongful j influencing of witnesses in a proceed- i ing before a United Stare? court or! commissioner.

NATIONAL EDITORIAL SERVICE OT THE WHEELING INTELLIGENCER Britain's Problem in Egypt is Like Ours in the Philippines. BY G. SCOTT DALG-LEISH Former General .Manager of the A trri^'iiltu ra 1 Bank of Kjrypt. I: i? extremely hard for the Occi dental mind in clearly visualize condi tions in i he Kast when the problem of government "(if ibe people, by the peo ple' 'is under discussion. The people of a republic, where every man has, i hemri't icallv ;? t least, a voice in ih<* govern m?int of the country, fe^l a natural impatience when they hear of any d^lay in ibe procuring of sik-Ii benefit for the people of other coun tries. A larK'"* number of people of this country foel that they are untrue so the principles upon which ibe great ness of their own land was founded if they do not hasten to enfranchise th?"> Philippine Islanders and permit them to rule themselves. This is ?i perfectly laudable feeling. It has had so exact a parallel in Egyptian history of ihe last thirty years that, ene who has had experience of the latter feols impelled to discuss at least one feat ure of the conditions affecting t his question In that country. When the English occupied Egypt, Mr. Gladstone specifically stated that; they would withdraw from the coun try as soon as the Egyptians proved themselves capable of conducting their own affairs satisfactorily. This declaration has been a constant, wea pon in the arguments of the Egyptian National Party. Few people realize that in pursuance of this policy an agreement was actually drawn up in 1SS7 under which England proposed to withdraw her troops two years later and to establish autonomy in Egypt. It is fortunate for both coun tries that this treaty with Turkey was strangled at its birth by Turkish in trigue. In all these years there has constantly been a party In England which has loudly sympathized with the aspirations of the Nationalists and has inveighed against the alleged treason to Egypt in the continued Eng lish occupation. What these people have failed to realize is the absolute incapacity for administration shown by a people who have for tens of cen turies been under the hell of various alien rulers and administrators. The ingrained habits of servility cannot be thrown off in a few years, perhaps not in a generation. While a nation of serfs may produce one man or a lew men of dominating character from time to time, it cannot be ex pected to produce a class of states men. except after many years of trial and error. The Pharoahs claimed, not only divine riuliC to rule, but absolute di vinity. A striking evidence of their consciousness of the inferiority .of their subjects is found in the mural paintmss and carvings on the walls of t lie ancient temples. There the stature of the Pharaoh is always shown as several times greater than I r that of (he attendant crowds of priests, , of soldiers and of fellahin. In later 'times 'ho power of the Pharaohs passed u> strangers, and the country itself never produced a ruling class. I Even ill l heir linn'- ihe influence of ? the stranger ha ci been fell. Joseph, jthe firs i Minister of Finance, _ was an Israelite. I'haroah found in him,] i though an alien and outcast blond, anj i economic and administrative knowl-| ! ''due which he could nowhere discover j [among his native ministers. After! i he Assyrians, the Persians. thej [(.reeks and the [lomHits, even ihe | I.Mameluke, though descendants of; slaves, yet ruled the country by sheer1 I force of character and warlike ability. J From the sixteen century to t.he nine-, teenth, amidst a succession of Turk* i ish Pashas, we find no record of a j [native Egyptian rising t> prominence. I Mohamed All. who achieved for Egypt j its semi-independence from Turkey.! his grandson Ismail, who. despite the economic depths to which he plunged the country, is yet the founder of modern Egypt, were Albanians. The | latest of theid descendants, the pres ent. Sultan, Ilassein Kamel, devoted though he is to the interests or the Egyptian Fellah, has no Egyptian blood In his veins. Of all the out standing ministers who have, aided in making Egypt what she is today, onlyj one, Mustapha Fehml, an upright, de voted but somewhat, colorless char-| acter, can be called a real Egyptian. Kiaz Pasha, in some way the strong- 1 est. was a Turk. and. as such, in many j ways reactionary and jealous in main taining the dignity of the Pasha class, almost all Turks also. Nubar Pasha, founder of the Mixed Tribun als, modern Egypt's one real states man. was an Armenian. Poulros Ohali, a Copt, as a reward for integrity and disinterestedness, fell a victim to the jbuller of a Mohamedan fanatic, i When Ismail Pasha founded a par liament along European lines and ex I plained lo the assembled notables (he lines of the party system with an administration party and an opposi tion party, they all automatically oc cupied the administration benches, | and no one could be found bold , enough to form an opposition. It is [a significant fact that, in spite of I every encouragement, and after manv [attempts, no purely Egyptian coni | pany has ever lion able to conduct commercial affairs satisfactorily. Till j such knowledge has ronie their wav, j how can the people hope to success i itill>' control the vastly complicated i and strenuons business of Kovern- 1 m en t. Let the legislators of America ?

I to a higher authority. wood law permitted those countries to ger into our market to the tune of S3-I9.000.ft00. making a balance of trade against us of $12t>, 000,000. In cluded in our exports were war ma terials to the vahte of $12S.OOO,!'OU which went to Russia in Asia, to which normally we send about $1,000,000 worth of our products annually. Without this stimulus to our export trade, the traiie balance against us would have been $253,000,000 In our commercial relations with the Asiatic division, and this does not take Into consideration the fact that our export trade to Japan was al9o increased by reason of shipments of war supplies. This gives just a little idea of how the war is helping us ont, and it also causes us to conclude that a return io the protective tariff policy, whether Mr. Wilson likes it or not. is advisable. The imports from Asia will continue! to increase, whil^ our war t ratio to! that division must suffer a slump after' the war. it Is confidently expected that the '"opfn mind" of which Wood row Wilson boaste will catch the pro tective Id^a within the next two or three years and the last bulwark of Democratic opposition will have been, broken down by Republican logic.
