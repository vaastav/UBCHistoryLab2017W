CLEVELAND'S FOKK1GN POUCT. In the President's message to Congress is the significant state ment that since the levy of trib ute at Corinto the Nicaragua government has taken occasion to recognize the good offices in the United States in bringing about a settlement between Great Britain and Nicaragua on a basis satisfactory and honorable to both countries. The attitude of our Government at that time was not only just and fair to the powers involved, but from the diplomatic point of view was chosen with consumate skill and maintained without impairment either of our dignity or our obli gations. It is certainly gratifying to his friends to find that they neither underestimated nor overestimat ed Mr. Cleveland's sense of pa triotic Americanism in declaring at the time ' of the Nicaraguan incident, that the incident estab lished no precedent to govern his action in the Venezuelan case. The British assertion in Nicara gua was in no sense a challenge to the exercise of our assumed powers under the Monroe doc trine. The claim now being made by the British in Venezuela certainly is. The differences ex isting between the two situations is clearly set out, withous any contemplated connection be tween the two statements, , in the sections of the message dealing with what has been done in Nic aragua and what it is proposed to do in Venezuela, Both con ditions are briefly described, but both embrace a full statement of the equities which should be considered in the settlement. Mr. Cleveland boldly asserts the Monroe doctrine in the Ven. ezuelan matter. He declares unequivocally, that the insist ence of England upon the estab lishment of an arbitrary linejbe yond which she will not accept arbitration as a means of adjust ing differences cannot be enters tained, for the reason that it contravenes the spirit of the Monroo doctrine. It would be difficult to make stronger state ment of our case. There is in the declaration no unfurling of the flag from the mountain peaks and no strident screaming of the eagle in vainglorious vaunts of prowess and empire, but every American with a self-respecting consciousness of his country's strengtn will feel that he has found a voice in the message. And that the message is regarded as the expression of a people capable of backing it up is clearly proved by the resentful tone of the London press. Mr. Cleveland has disappointed the jihgos who were lately de claring that he would favor some scheme of annexation of the Hawaiian Islands based on suf fiage of the inhabitants. No reference is made to that illuso ry and misleading scheme con cocted by the Dole usurpers to further their plans of spoilation and confiscation. Mr. Cleveland has made a record in Hawaii by which he can well afford to stand, leaving to the Republicans in Congress the responsibility of attempting to repudiate it. The renewal of his previous sugges - tion that we withdraw from our un-American position in Samoa, where, in concert with England and Germany, we are maintain ing a government by force, is logically parallel with, although not a part of, that record. Mr. Cleveland's foreign policy maintains alike the honor, the dignity and the interest of his country. The New York Woild opines that the seat of Speaker Reed's ability is in his brains, to which the Charleston News and Courier replies that it lies in his cheek. Yet another moral is conveyed by Reed: It's wiser to shave the upper lip than shoot off the un der one too much. Chairman Carter, of the Re- nublican National Committee. warns his Republican brethren not to be too confident of success in the Presidential election now so near. He concedes that the Democrats have what we have elsewhere termed "a fighting chance." of success, and says he does not think it would be wise fnr tha Republicans to be over confident. Chairman Carter is a shrewd poHtician or wire-korker. It was because he was so well qualified to lead his party that be was selected to be chairman of the National Committee. It was because knew how to gov ern himself that Mr. Carter was selected to govern others, if that .may be called governing which js'nothing but leading 

TEASING MR. REED. The Atlanta Journal makes the point in regard to the fact that a good many Republican news papers which are opposed to Mr. Thomas B. Reed's Presidential candidacy, are directing his at tention to the fact that only one man has been both speaker of the House of Representatives and President. We cannot see says the Jour nal, exactly how this affects either Mr. Reed's fitness for the office he is seeking, or his chances of getting it. The newspapers whirh are parading the disappointments of former speakers are, we sus pect, merely nagging the present able and ambitious politician who wields the gavel over the, house. Mr. Reed, however, is not an easy man to tease. Moreover, he has unbounded confidence in himself and has demonstrated his contempt for precedents. Still the record of the broken hopes of distinguished party leaders who filled the speaker's chair and tried in vain to climb to the Presidency is interesting and in two instances, at least, pathetic. James K. Polk, the only speaker of the House who ever became President, was not one of the foremost leaders of party, though he was by no means an ordinary man. Henry Clay and James G. Blaine were tbe two most dis tinguished .Presidential candid ates we have had who had been speakers of the House, and each of them was promineut three times as a Presidential candidate, though Blaine was nominated only once Each of these men was the popular idol of his party; each had a far more enthusiastic following than Mr. Reed ever has had or ever can command. John Bell, who was speaker of the House just before Polk, was the candidate of the Union party for President in 1860. If he cares to dabble in preced ents Mr. Keedcan therefore point to four speakers of the House who have been nominated for President and the nomination is what he is after just now. The eagerness with which the Republican nomination for the next Presidency is sought proves that the Republican aspirants to that high office are confident that whoever is nominated by their party will be elected. The Dem ocrats concede that they have only a fighting chance to elect the next President; but this chance they are going to take. McKinley and Reed seem at present to have concentrated upon them the eyes of the whole country. Why are Harrison, Allison, and others in the back ground just now? It is because the leaders of the Republican party have not yet decided whether protection is or is not to be the main issue in the ap proaching presidential campaign. A press dispatch from St. Louis under date of the 9th says: "Manager Lewis, of the South ern Hotel, received telegrams from Speaker Thomas B. Reed and Major William McKinley this afternoon, asking that rooms be reserved for their respective delegations should St. Louis be decided upon as the place to hold the next Republican Na tional Convention. It doesn't exactly argue a change in Dunraven's views in this yacht affair that his taking passage for America shows he's coming over to our side. What Venezuela objects to in the Schombergk line is that there may be something crooked about it. Itio Veteran's Parade. New York, Dec. 9. The ex ecutive committee of the united yeterans' parade met at noon to day in the rooms of the Board of Trade and Mr. Charles Dana, chairman of the executive o.nm mittee. not being rjresent.

CLEVE LAND DENIED BY THE REICHSTAG, HOW WE TREAT GERMAN SUGAR. The German Minister for Foreign Affairs Says Germany Has Always legally Fulfilled Her Treaty Obliga tions With the United States. Berlin. Dec. 9. There was a large attendance in the Reichstag to-day in view of this being the date for the presentation of the financial statement of Count von Posa-dowski-Wehner, Secretary of the Imperial Treasury. The Chan cellor, Prince Hohenlohe: the Minister for War, General Bron sart Schellendorf. and the Min ister of Finance, Dr. Miquel, and other ministers were present. At the opening of the proceedings the House adopted a proposol to stop the prosecutions of Herren Liebnecht. Stadthageri, Bueb, Herschel, Fischer and Heinrich Moeller. The conservatives op yosedthe motion. The Secretary of the Treasury stated that the Federal States for the current year might reckon upon 30,000.000 marks over the estimate in direct reve nue. He added that he also ex pected to show an increase of 31,000,000 marks, compared with last year. MR. CLEVELANDS'S MESSAGE. The Minister for Foreign Af. fairs, Freiherr Marschall von Bieberstein, made a statement on President Cleveland's recent message to Congress. He denied that there was any differential treatment in Germany of Ameri can cattle and insurance compan ies, and urged the House not to be intimidated by threats of re prisals. - Herr Fritzen, a mem ber of the Centre party asked tor a declaration upon the part of ;he government regarding the alleged threatened reprisals against Cermany's trade con tained in President Cleveland's recent message to Congress. In reply the Minister tor For eign Affairs, Freiherr Marschall von Bieberstein, said: '-The United Ctates will treat German sugar the. same as in 1894, in spite of the fact that we have the most favored treatment. It is, therefore, surprising that Presi dent Cleveland should reproach Germany with trdating AmeiU1 can products differentially and American insurance companies vexatiously. This is quite un founded. The importation of American cattle and beef was prohibited because Texas fever broke out in a codsignmeut re ceived here. Io is our duty to show solicitude for the mainten ance of the condition of German cattle, and this duty can in no way be subornated to the politico-commercial interests of other countries. 

WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED. "Similarly, there is no ques tion of the differential treatment of American insurance com panies. The regulations are published by the Prussian Min ister for the Interior, and are applied equally to the home and foreign companies. Whether these regulations met the object in view or not is a matter solely for the Prussian Government to determine and foreign States have not the right of criticism. We have always truly and loy ally fulfilled our treaty obliga tions to the United States and will continue to do so; but do not let us be intimidated by threats of reprisals or induced to revoke our measures. The German Government is always willing to discuss politico commercial ques tions with the United States on a treaty basis, in order to deal with them in a manner befitting our multifarious trade relations with a great and friendly power, But we expect reciprocal treatment to. the fullest extent. "The Foreign Office, in my fu ture handling of the question, will combine calmness and mod eration with the firmness which corresponds with our rights and duty, and to which our interests and well-founded rights entitle us." CAMPAIGN AGAINST SOCIALISM. Count Von Kardoff, the Ger man silver champion, expressed satisfaction at the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and urged the government to enter upon a strenuous cam paign against Socialism, declaring that the Ministry must, before all, show socialism a united and decided front. The House then adjourned. Nmperor William this morning received the Presidents of the Reichstag, and expressed the hapejthat their tasks during the present session would make satisfactory .progress. His Maj esty then announced that on January 18, the anniversary of tne iounaation oi tne empire, he proposes to give a great fete at, the imperial palace, at which he hoped to see both the present members of the Reichstag and those who belbng to that great epoch and who are still alive.

There is in the mail division of the treasury department a very popular desk, to which is attached the very peculiar merit that the occupant is by that occupancy placed on the sure road to matrimony. No sooner is the position made vacant than there is a scramble amontr the remaining clerks for the lucky place, the fortunate candidate feeling sure that it will only be m short time before she is advanced to the Hymeneal grade. Within the past ten years the desk has been occupied by seven lady clerks following each other in quick succession as emb-o brides, and the records during that time indicate that they have come from all parts of the country only to finally meet their destiny while occupying the fateful desk. Miss Birdie Walker, of Tennessee, started the pace by marrying a resi dent of the district, after a few months' service. She was succeeded by her sister from the same state, who speedily followed her example and left the enviable position open to a newcomer. She arrived on schedule time from Virginia in the person of Idljs Easby-Smith. who shed the glory of a famous Virginian name over the talismanic desk for a short time and then was led to the altar by a journalist of Washington. Next came from Delaware a relative of Senator Gray Miss Sue Gray who was followed ia an incredibly short time by a d-leate from Mas sachusetts Misj Ilereine Dickey. Miss Dickey artractjd much at tention during h-r stny in the de partment through her remarkable rcsomblane- to Mrs. Cleveland, and later married Mr. Simon Flyun, who at that time was connected with the Washing-; on branch of the Baltimore Sun, and now manages a paper in Spokane, Wash. Pennsylvania also furnishes a rep resentive in Miss Ella Newton, a granddaughter pf the first commis sioner of agriculture. Her marriage to a well-known resident of this city is a recoct cvmt. The lust tfradii ate from this sough t-for post is an other sent hern girl, and was for merly Mi Td-.v "Lindsay, of Alabama, but on Easter Monday she becamo the wife of D- Henry D. Fry, of Washington, and the place is tem porarily unoccupied. This happy illustration of rotation inoSice, as exemplified by the fem inine contingent of wage-earners, is the onlvo.ieon record where nobodv "kicks," for each woman thinks she is advancing her interests either bj' fiHing the position or leaving it, as the ease may be.
