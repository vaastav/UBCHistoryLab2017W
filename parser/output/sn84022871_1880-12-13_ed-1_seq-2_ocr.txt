Untuned by injlurnce and unbribed by pain ; lrt patriot Truth her glarioui precepts draw. Hedged la Liberty. Religion, and Lav." PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Ftllow Citizens of the Senate and Home of Hrjiresentittice : I congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity of the country. By the favor of Divine Providence we have ln-en blessed during the past year with health, with abundant harvests, with profitable employment for all our people, and with contentment at home and with peace and friendship with other nations. The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election of Chief Magistrate has afforded another opportunity to the people of the United States to exhibit to- the world a significant example of the peaceful and safe transmission of the power and au thority of Government from the public servants whose terms of office are about to expire to their newly chosen successors. This example cannot fail to Impress pro foundly thoughtful people of other coun tries with the advantages which republi can institutions afford. Continued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the rights of citizen ship, conferred upon the colored people by the recent amendments to the Consti tution still prevails in several of the late slave holding States. It has, perhaps, not been manifested in the recent election to any large extent in acts of violence or Intimidation. It has, however, by fraud ulent practices in connection with the regulations as to the places and manner of voting, and with counting, returning and canvassing the votes cast, been suc cessful in defeating the exercise of the right preservative of all rights, the rignt or sunrage, wiiicn tne constitution ex pressly confers upon our enfranchised citizens. It is the desire of the good people of the whole countiy that sectionalism as a factor in our politics should disappear. They prefer that no section of the.country should be united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the equal rights amendments to the Con stitution is all that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or disregarded, it is safe to assume that the people who placed them in the Constitution, as embodying the legitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe them to be wise and necessary, will continue to act together, and to insist that they shall be obeyed The paramount question still is to the enjoyment of the right by every American citizen who has the requisite qualiflca tlons, to freely cast his vote and have it honestly counted. "With this question rightly settled, the country will be reliev ed of the contentions of the past ; bygones will indeed be bygones ; and political and party issues with respect to economy and efficiency of administration, internal im provements, the tariff, domestic taxation, education, finance and other important subjects will then receive' their full share of attention. The sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our citizens must be main tained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the Government of the country. Happily the history of the late election shows that in many parts of the country where opposition to the fif teenth amendment has heretofore pre vailed it it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogether, if firm and well consid ered action is taken by Congress. I trust the House of Representatives and the Senate, which have a right to judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of their own members, will see to it that every case of violation of the letter or spirit of the fifteenth amendment is thor oughly Investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of the Executive, with sufficient appropria tions for the purpose, to prosecute un sparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights guaran teed them by the Constitution. It is not, however, to be forgotten that the best and safest guarantee of the pri mary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for self protection which can belong only to a people whose right to universal suffrage is supported by universal education. The means at the command of the local and State author ities are, in many cases, wholly inade quate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. This is especially true where before emancipation the education of the people was neglected or prevented la the interests of slavery. Firmly con vinced that the system of popular educa tion deserves the earnest attention of the people of the whole country, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the Government of the United States, I re spectfully recommend that Congress, by suitable legislation and with proper safeguards, supplement the local educa tional funds in the several States by devoting to the purpose grants of public lands, and, if necessary, by appropria tions from the Treasuay of the United States. in my former annual messages I have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent necessity of a reformation of the Civil Service of the Government. My views concerning the dangers of patron age, or appointments for personal or partisau considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and experience iu the Executive office, and I believe these dangers threaten the stabil ity of the Government. Abuses so serious in their nature cannot be permanently tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the eulargement'of admin istrative service, .as the growth of the country in population increases the number or officers and policemen employ ed. The reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the regulation of appointments, promotions, and remov als, establishing a uniform method, having exclusively in view, in every Instance, the attainment of the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens, and the most eco nomical and efficient administration of the public business. Competitive examinations in aid of impartial appointments and promotions, have been conducted for some years past in several of the Executive Departments, and by my direction this system has been adopted in the custom houses aud post offices of the larger cities of the country. A method which has so approved itself by experimental tests at points where such tests may be fairly considered con clusive, should be extended to all subor dinate positions under the Government I also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as free as any other citizen to express his political opinions aud to use his means for their advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safe as any private citizen iu refusing all demands upon his salary for political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who are engaged in the public service, and likewise contain stringent provisions against the use of official authority to coerce the political action of private citizens or of official subordinates, is greatly to be desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement or tne civil service, ana especially to a reform in the method of appointment and removal, has been found to be the practice, under what is known as the spoils system, by which the ap pointing power has been so largely en croached upon by members of Congress. The first step in the reform of the civil service must be a complete divorce be tween Congress and the Executive in the matter of appointments. The corrupting doctrine that "to the victors belong the spoils" is inseparable from Congressional patronage as ths established rule and practice of parties in power. "Under the Constitution, the President and heads of departments are to make nominations for office. The Senate is to advise and consent to appointments, and the House of Kepresentaiives is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The best interests of the public service demands that these distinctions be respected ; that Senators and Representatives who may be judges and accusers should not dictate appointments to office."' Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our country is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship, and that it can be permanently done only by the co-operation of the Legislative and Executive Departments of the Govern ment, I again commend the whole subject to your considerste attention. It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United States to suppress polygamy where in now exists in our Territories and to prevent its ex tension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made by the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Experience has shown that the legislation on this subject, to be effec tive, requires extensive modification and amendment. The longer action is delayed the more difficult it will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. I recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a governor and judges, or commissioners, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate a government analogous to the provisional government established for the Territory northwest of the Ohio, by the ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of local government, I recommend that the right to vote, hold office and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah be confined to those who neither practice nor uphold polygamy. Our relations with foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace, and have presented no occasion for con cern as to their maintenance. The efforts of the Department of State to enlarge the trade and commerce of the United States, through the active agency of consular officers and through the dis semination of information obtained from them, have been unrelaxed. The interest in these efforts, as developed in our com mercial communities, and the value oi the information secured by this means, to the .trade and manufactures of the country, were recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was made for the more frequent publication of consular and other reports by the Department of State. The prosperous energies of our domes tic industries, and their immense produc tion of the subjects of foreign commerce, invite, and even require, an active devel opment of the wishes and interests of our people in that direction. Especially important is it that our commercial rela tions with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico should be direct, and not through the circuit of European systems, and sliould be carried on in our own bottoms. The full appreciation of the opportunities which our front on the Pacific Ocean gives to commerce with Japan, China and the East Indies, with Australia and the island groups which lie Along these routes of navigation, should Inspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping, and to administer by our own capital, a due proportion of this trade. An additional and not unimportant, although secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging the Navy may be found in the unquestionable service to the expan sion of our commerce which would be rendered by the frequent circulation of naval ships in the seas and ports of all quarters of the globe." Ships of the proper construction and equipment, to be of the greatest efficiency in case of mar itime war, might be made constant and active agents iu time of peace in the advancement and protection of our for eign trade, and in the nurture and dici pline of young seamen, who would, nat urally, in some numbers, mix with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home and abroad rec ognize the value to foreign commerce of an active movement of our naval vessels, and the intelligence and patriotic zeal of our naval officers in promoting every interest of their countrymen is a just subject of national pride. The condition of the financial affairs of the Government, as shown by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory. It is believed that the present financial situation of the United States, whether considered with . respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or the extent of our resources, is more favorable than that of any other country of our time, and has never been surpassed by that of any country at any period of its history. All our industries are thriv ing; the rate of interest is low; new railroads are being constructed ; a vast immigration is increasing our population, capital and labor; new enterprises in great number arc in progress, and our commercial relations with other countries are improving. The ordinary revenues from all sources, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, were 333,526,010.98. The ordinary ex penditures for the same period were 2C7,r4,957.78, leaving a surplus revenue of $05,883,653.20, which, with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the Treasury, of $8,084,434.21 was applied tp the redemption of bonds. The amount due the sinking fund for this year was $37,931,943.55. There was applied thereto the sum of $73,904,617.41, being $35,972,973.86 in excess of the actual requirements for the year. The aggregate of the revenues from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, was $333,526,610.98, an increase over the preceding year of $59, 099,427.52. The receipts thus far of the current year, together with the estimated receipts for the remainder of the year, amount to $350,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet the estimated expendi tures of the year, and leave a surplus of $90,000,000. The debt of the United States, less cash in the Treasury and exclusive of accruing interest, attained its maximum of $2,756, 431,571.43 in August, I860, and since that time has been reduced to $1,886,019,504. 65. Of the principal of the debt, $108, 758,100 has been paid since March 1, 1877, effecting an annual saving of interest of $6,107,593. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing a low rate of interest, and the application of the proceeds to the re demption of bonds bearing a higher rate. The annual saving thus secured since March, 1877, is $14,290,453.50. The continuance of specie payments has not been interrupted or endangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to the revival of business, and to our remarkable prosper ity. The increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1, 1879, is estimated at $227,399,428. There are still in existence, uncancelled, $346,681,016 of United States legal tender notes. These notes were authorized as a war measure, made necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which the United States was then engaged. These notes long since became like any other obligation of the Government a debt to be paid, and, when paid, to be cancelled as mere evidence of an indebtednes no longer existing. I therefore repeat what was said in the annual message of last year, that the retirement from circulation of United States notes with the capacity of legal-tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government, and the interest and securi ty of the people. The coinage of silver dollars, began in March, 1878, and has been continued as required by the act. The average rate per month to the present time has been $2,276,492. The total amount coined prior to the first of November last was $72,847,750. Of this amount $47,084,450 remain iu the Treasury, and only $25, 763,291 are in the hands of the people. A constant effort has been made to keep this currency in circulation, and consider able expense has been necessarily incur red for this purpose, but its return to the Treasury has been prompt and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation of the friends of the measure at the time of its adoption, the value of the silver dol lar, containing 412 1-2 grains of silver has not increased. During the year prior to the passage of the bill authorizing its coiDoge, the market value of the silver which It con tained was from ninety to ninety-two cents, as com pared with the standard gold dollar. Daring the last year the average market value of the silver dollar has been eighty-eight and a half cents. It is obvious that the legislation of the last Congress in regard to . silver, so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in the value of silver as the result of that legislation, has failed to produce the effect then predicted. The longer the law remains in force, requiring as it does the coinage of a nominal dollar, which in reality is not a dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this country will be forced to accept a single metal as the sole legal standard of value in 

ALMON MEAKER SEN TENCED TO DEATH. In accordance with the terms of the statute which provided that when any person has pleaded guilty of murder, the court shall hear testimoney to de termine the degree, the county court, on the 4th inst, listened to the testi mony of Sheriff Atherton about Almon's confession to him on the night when they went together and recovered the body of little Alice, and the testimony of Dr. Henry Janes of Water bury in regard to the post mortem examination of her corpse, and the certainty from that examination, that death did not result from natural causes. The .re spondent's counsel put in no testimony. Almon sat in his chair in the bar be hind his counsel as unconcerned a9 ever. He had been exhorted by his own coun sel, by the counsel of the state and by the officers to tell the whole truth. He had been told that if be told the truth and it became evident that his share in the murder was what they believed it to be, everything 6hould be done to se cure a commutation of his sentence to imprisonment for life. But he refused to open his lips. He still clings to the salvation of his mother, and seems will ing and even anxious to sacrifice his own life that hers may be saved. He was told that his assertion that she was not with him, and had nothing to do with the murder, would do her no good and would only seal his own fate ; but he was immovable. Judge Redfieli, in an address of great humanity, in wich he regretted the duty which was impos ed upon him by the law, and intimated that if the statute had not made it im perative upon the court to find the crime murder by poison to be murder in the first degree, they might have found otherwise in order that the sentence should be milder. He directed the clerk to ask the respondent if he had anything to say why sentence should not be passed upon him. Almon stood up, looked almost defiantly at the court and 8aid,'No." Judge Kedfield then pronounced sentence, as follows : The sentence of the court is that you, the said Louis Almon Weaker, on the second Friday of February in the year 1883, between the hours of one and two o'clock in the afternoon of said day, within the walls, or inclosed yard, of the state prison in Windsor, in the county of Windsor, be hanged by the neck till dead. And it Is ordered that a warrant be issued by the clerk of this court, under the seal of said court, to the sher iff of said Windsor county, commanding said sheriff to cause said sentence to be carried iuto effect. And it is also the sentence of this court that in the meantime you, the said Louis Almon Meaker.be confined in said state prison at hard labor therein till within three months of said time fixed for said execution ; and for and during said three months next prior to said time fixed fur the execution, and up to said execution, you, the said Louis Almon Meaker, be confined in solitary congnement in said state prison. The respondent was then taken back to jail. He and his mother will be taken to the state prison in a few days. Since her conviction she has been kept in the common jail because it has not been considered safe to leave her in the woman's room. She and Almon there fore have had means of communication with each other and it is believed that it is her influence that seals his lips. She is willing to see him hanged, if she can only believe that she thereby has a chance. Daily Journal. See advertisement of the Boston Jour nal.

Radix. Amputation of the Leg. The old Family Physician at Fault Dr. David Kennedy the Sue--' cessful Surgeon. Money is the universal necessity, and none but a cynic or a fool will affect to despise it. Mr. Abrara Elsworth, of Port Ewen, Ulster county, N. Y., had realized this truth. His disease involved the whole of his thigh-bone, and the suffering man looked for ward, not without apparent reason, to death as his only deliverer. His family physician refused to ampu tate the limb asserting that the operation would kill the patient on the spot. Dr. David KENNEDY, of Rondout, N. Y., who was consulted, held a different opinion and amputated the limb. The Doctor then administered freely his great Blood-Specific FAVOR ITE REMEDY to afford tone and strength to the sys tem, prevent the return of the disease, and Mr. Els worth remains to this day in the bloom of health. This gentleman's disease was the offspring of foul blood, and Kennedy's FAVORITE REMEDY purified the blood and restored to him the power once more to enjoy his life.

The Constitution of the United States, sound finan cial principles, and our best Interests, all require that the country should have as it legal tender money both gold and silver com of an lutrinsic value, as bullion, equivalent to that which upon its face it purports to possess. The Constitution, in express terms, recognizes both gold and silver as the only true legal-tendea money. It will, iu my judgment, con tribute to this result if Congress will repeal so much of existing legislation as requires the coinage of silver dollars containing only 412 1-2 grains oi silver, and in its stead will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent value as bullion with gold dolars. This will defraud no man, and will be in accordance with familiar precedents. Congrets on several occasions has altered the ratio of value between gold and silver, in order to establish it more nearly in accordance" with the actual ratio of value between the two metals. In financial, legislation every measure in ihe direc tion of greater fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations, has been' found by experience to diminish the rates of inierest which debtors are requiied to pay, and to increase the facility with which mouey can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. I commend to the attention of Congress the great services of the Commander-in-Chief of our armies duriDg the war for the Union, (Gen. Grant) who by wise, firm and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous conflict to a close. ' The legislation of the United States contains many precedents, for the recognition of distinguished military merit au thorizing rank and emoluments to be conferred for eminent services to the country. An act of Congress authorizing the appointment of a Captain General of the Army, with suitable provisions relating to com pensation, retirement, and other details, would, in my judgment, be altogether fitting and proper,, and would be warml approved by the country. A large increase is reported in the disposal of pub lic lands for settlemeut during the past year, which marks the prosperous growth of our agricultural industry, and a vigorous movement of population toward our unoccupied lands. As this movement proceeds, the raodificatiom of our land laws, as well as proper legislation to regulate the disposition of public lands, become of more pressing necessity, and I therefor, invite the consideration of Congress to the report and accompanying draft of a bill, made by the Public Lands Commission, which were communicated by me to Congress at the last sesson. Early action upon this important Bubject is highly desirable. The Commissioner of Agriculture expresses the confident belief that his efforts in behalf of the pro duction of our own sugar and tea have been encour agingly rewarded. The importance of the results at tained have attracted marked attention at home, and have received the special consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our own tea, and the manufacture of our own sugar, would make a difference of many millions of dollars annually in the wealth of the nation. The Commissioner of Education reports a continued increase of public interest in educational afTairs, and that the public schools generally throughout the countiy are well sustained.
