They Sny President Roosevelt I a TrnJr I?sniiftIonlt The London Pre on .Monroeism. VIENNA, Doc. I.-DIscu-sing President Roosevelt's mo.ago to Congress, the Aus trian papers are unanimous In prai-dng the reference to Anarchist4, but on other points they are not quite so laudatory. The Frcnvlf nblatt comments on the peace ful tone of the. message, remarking that Iresi ! nt Roosevelt evidently will not al low him?elf to be carried away by sense less chauvinists. The Neues Wiener Tageblatt dwells on Its "imperialistic character." adding "There lives in America, a spirit, as an 'append ant' to thf Monroe doctrine formula, of Eu rope for the .American, and thi formula, although clad in the most peaceful phrases, pervades the message." The Deutsche Volkstlatt declares that the policy enunciated must expi::d American production, and, therefore, "measures for the protection of Austrian production are required, by the the dictates of self-preservation." The Austrian Volks Zeitung believes that the strength of the ;messaKe lies In the moderation of Its tone, adding: "It speaks in the Unsuae of a strong mii who knows lie requires r.o sonorous words to be heard." The XfUfs Wiener Journal also dealing with the power of the message, recom mends Its closest study "so as to find means, at the proper time, of spoiling his parne." The Wiener Morgen Zeitung, following similar lines, declares that the govern ments of all civilized states will only too soon recognize the tremendous danger that these measures constitute for the com niercl.il policy of foreign communities. tiii: 3lOMUi: 

DOCTRINE. I'urther Comment of London Newspa per on the Message. LONDON, Dec. 4. President Roosevelt's message to Congress holds the first place In the afternon newspapers here to-day. The comment, however, differs little from that In the morning papers. Strong general ap proval of the announcement which, as the St. James Gazette says, "strikes notes of conscious strength and assured success," is the pervading tone of the editorials. "The spirited declaration for Monroeism will cau.-e a Mutter in Europe," says the Westminster Gazette, which continues: "If the Kaiser is really of the opinion, as al leged, that 'the American peril' is the question of the future for Europe, he will lind confirmation in the message. lie will envy Secretary Game's surplus of fifteen million pounds available for building iron clads, or other purposes of the American doctrine, backed by the American surplus, which means that many European ambi tions in South America are foredoomed to failure. We do not doubt that it is the policy of this country, if called on to make a choice, to stand by the United States in defense of the doctrine. We are also an Arnexican power, and It was we who first iUJCsrested the idea." .After noting that South America, the only outlet for the surplus of population of Eu rope, is largely In the possession of the corrupt Spanish, over whom the United States throws its aegis without guarantee Ins pood government the Westminster Jazett concludes: "Jt Is not easy to af lirm this in the interests of mankind, and when the United States, after warning Eu rope not to enter America, proceeds itself o step out from the American continent, ven a theoretical defense is difficult. The itu tüon has the germs of an Immense con troversy in the future."

The reading of the resolution was re ceived with applause and it was adopted unanimously by a ri?In vote and a copy ordered to be forwarded to the President. Treatment of Anarchist. NEW 

YORK, Dec. 4. No portion of the President's message is more cordially ap proved of in England than that referring to the question of treatment of Anarchists, says the London correspondent of the Trib nue. It 13 considered exceedingly gratify ing that President Roosevelt should not bo afraid to make proposal?, which on the sur face are open to that criticism that they are subversive of personal liberty in the matter of opinion. In this country there is a strong undercurrent of feeling against laws which permit and actually encourage the Immigration of foreign Anarchists. London, especially, feels strongly on the point, and owing to the vast number of un desirable aliens who have taken up their abode In the East End. the metropolis would gladly welcome any restrictive meas ures. In reference to the proposal that mankind should bind Itself together to make anarchy, like piracy, a crime against the law of nations, it is pointed out that the difficulty is to define what anarchy con sists of, and to obtain trustworthy evidence against those holding such a doctrine be fore they commit overt acts which would render them amenable to ordinary criminal law. Favorably Received In Mexico. 

MEXICO CITY, Dec. 4.-President Roose velt's message sent here In full has been very favorably received in government and business circles. The general comment is that his declaration In favor of Cuban, In dependence and a free trade policy with the Island will greatly strengthen American prestige all over Latin America. He has completely disarmed the clerical press of one of its principal arguments against the Washington government. The Mexican Herald says to-day of th message: "Its sound sense and remarkable comprehensiveness is matched by its re markable high literary quality. It is a message on which patriotic Americans and all lovers of human progress can take their stand as on a platform of sound and in vigorating principles. The message hi con servative and yet progressive and Is a frank exposition of healthy American ideas by the moderate and statesmanlike leader of the American people." View of (erninn Officials. BERLIN, Iec. 4. The officials of the Foreign Office here make a special applica tion of President Itosevelt's definition of the Monroe doctrine, in his message to Congress in Germany's dispute with Vene zuela. A Foreign Office official intimated to-day that while a friendly adjustment of Germany's claims is still expected, a forci ble settlement might become Germany's duty at no distant date. Such a settlement, If necessary, would not Infringe on the President's policy, nor offend the United States in the least particular. The official also said that the President's immigration views were not of special interest to Ger many now, because tho immigration to America was inconsiderable. 

STORY OF A MASSACRE KLItTlIEIt IAIlTICUIiAItS OK THK DISASTER AT DALINC.IGA, SAMAR. Dolo Tnken Into the Chnrcli Con cealed In a Collin Scene of Car nnge Described try n Survivor. VICTORIA, B. C. Dec. 4. The steamer Shlno Maru, which arrived to-day, brought further particulars of tha massacre at Ballngiga, Samar. It seems the attack was long planned and carried out with precision. The night previous to the mas sacre two women of the place gathered in the church to pray for their husbands and relations, and during the day a sealed cof fin was brought into the church. In this coffin numbers of bolos were secreted, and during the night the boloers stealthily hid in the church and armed themselves. The next morning the attackers were already within the church, and one of the native police gave the signal by wresting a. gun from a sentry, and, after firing, crying the word agreed upon. Then the bolomen sur prised the soldiers, who were at breakfast, without riffes or other arms, and they were massacred. Private Myers, one of the survivors of the scene of carnage, tells of the stand made by Corporal llurke and several oth ers who had revolvers and rirtes. The bolo men were driven from the barracks room and shot as they jumped through the win dows. Sergeant IJeatro attempted to rescue the officers, but it was too late, and alter driving back the bolomen the survivors took down the American Mag and escaped, having a trying time before Uazey was reached. During the tight. Myers says, one American, who had his left arm cut off, dropped to the ground and worked his rille with the other arm until cut down. SHOT HIS ASSAILANTS.

MORNINGSTAR DEFEATED n.vnuTKL, Tin: Fituscu billiard CHAMPION, WOX EASILY. Indiana's Expert Played with an Im perfect Hall IIowIon Defeated by "Whnrd" Schnffer. NEW YORK. Dec. 4.-Louis Barutel, of France, and Ora C. Morningstar, of Indi ana, played the fourth game of the Inter national billiard championship series this afternoon. Neither played brilliantly and the game was the slowest so far in the tournament. The Frenchman won by 400 to Morningstar's 23, but it took him ixty-flve innings to do so. Morningstar had a rather imperfect ball and claimed that the red ball was cracked, a statement which was borne out by Jake Schaefer after the game. Morn ingstar, however, made the highest runs in the game, making 32 and 31 by beautiful nursing and position plays. Barutel's high runs were 24, 23; average, 6 10-63. Morn Ingstar's high runs wero 32, 31 and 22; aver age, 4 3-61. The reappearance of "Jake" Schaeffer, the wizard billlardlst, of Chicago, was the chief feature of to-night's play. Schaeffer's opponent was the young Canadian expert, Leonard Howison, and. while the veteran player beat the young aspirant by a score of 4öi) to 357, Howison made a host of friends by his nervy play throughout the game. Schaeffer's high runs were 65, 19. IS; , average, 5 5-67. Howison's high runs wen 31. 21. 20. IS; average, 5 22-67. To-morrow Sutton and Morningstar play in the afternoon and Slosson .

The suit was brought for $2.0o0 damages, which Von Der Ahe says he suffered as the result of his ex pulsion from the National League in lSiiS. The defendant clubs contended in the de murrer that Von Der Ahe had no legal right to sue them and that his charges did not state facts sufficient to make a cause of action. In an opinion Judge Ryan did not sustain those views, holding that Von Der Ahe had the right to sue. Amos Rusie JilnnlnK Trenches. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. MUNCIE, Ind., Dec. 4.

ASTORIA, Ore., Dec 4. The fate of the British ship Nelson, bound to Quenstown with wheat, reported early to-day as hav ing turned turtle during a storm last night and gone to the bottom with her crew of twcntj'-elght men, cannot be known until to-morrow. By that time she will probably be sighted if still afloat. If the tugs which will institute search fail to find her she will doubtless be given up as lost. The tugboat people think she is safe, but there is cause for the gravest fear. The tug Tatoosh searched all night and until noon to-day, but not the slightest trace of the ship was found. Notwithstanding this. Captain Bailey, of the tug, believes the Nelson Is safe and that she will show up to-morrow. He thinks she has made for Pupret sound, while others are Inclined to believe that Captain Perrlam, of the Nelson, will make for the Columbia river. The Nelson carries twenty-eight men all told.

Mayor Rookwnlter Will Send Invita tion Local Teams That Will Go to IIuiTalo. When the two teams of Indianapolis bowlers go to Buffalo next month to partici pate in the National Bowling tournament they will make strong efforts to secure the national tournament for Indianapolis in 1003. Members of the Mai Ion team, who have thought of going to Buffalo have had the matter in mind for some time and yes terday the subject was given consideration by some of the bowlers. The National Bowling Congress Is one of the principal sporting events in amateur circles in the country. It attracts bowling teams from all the large cities of the coun try and between 2,000 and 3,000 bowlers and strangers to the city where the tourna ment is held. There will be teams at Buf falo from all the large cities in the East and all the most important cities from the West. The tournament will last nearly a week and the city of Buffalo, it is said, will be greatly benefited by the gathering of such a large number of bowlers. The invitation to the National Bowling Congress to come to Indianapolis for its next tournament will be extended by Mayor Bookwalter. and he may go to Buffalo to urge its acceptance. The matter has not been taken up with him, but the bowlers who are interested in the matter will con fer with him this week. The Commercial Club will also be interested in the matter and that organization will be asked to lend its influence in bringing the congress to this city. Last year the congress was held at Chicago and the 10Ö2 tournament will be held in Buffalo. In 1003 it will bo held in the West and Indianapolis bowlers believe that if efforts are made to secure it the tournament will be held in Indianapolis. One of the leading members of the Mar ion Club, and a prominent bowler, said yes terday that if the bowling alleys in the city will take tho matter in hand and guarantee a sum to be used for prizes and to defray other expenses that subscriptions could be secured from hotels and business men. Part of the prize money would, no doubt, have to be guaranteed by the city, but the large part of it would come from the entrance fees. In Buffalo $3,000 was at first guaran teed in cash prizes, but so many entries have been received that it is expected there will be nearly $3,0X) to be distributed as prizes. The presidents of the Indianapolis and Independent leagues will appoint delegate. to the bowling Congress, and they will probably be men who will be entered in the bowling contests.

BASKET BALL AT BUTLER GREAT INTEREST CENTERS IX THE SCHEDULED CONTESTS. It Is Thought he Tenm Will Equal that of Lnst Year High School Girl Other Sport. Since the close of the football season athletic activity at Butler has been turned towards basket ball. The regular squad of players has been joined by several football men and practice has been begun in earn est. The team will be chosen in a day or two in order to get together for the first game of the season, which is scheduled with the Training School team for Satur day evening, Dec. 14. Although Butler loses two of last year's players, McGaughey and Gillum, the team expects to be as fast as last year's aggre gation. Two teams have been practicing for the past month and all the men are in good physical condition. The new material this year has been more abundant than ever before. Huggins, Murray and Butler, of last year's team, are in school. This leaves two positions to 1111 center and guard. The most likely candidate for center Is Longley, because of his height, he being over six feet tall. Blair and Mc- Hatten are leaders for the guards positions, Blair being the more experienced man. Other prominent candidates for guards are Behring, Adams. Kingsbury, Brown, Long and Harnett. The forwards will in all probability be Huggins and Murray, both fast and experienced men. Rivals for their positions are Gufftn, Wilson and Dyer. Frank B. Long, manager of the team, has arranged, besides the six league games, an excellent schedule. Although the dates are not fixed yet, games will be played with Purdue, Indiana, Wabash, Hanover and the State Normal School. A Southern trip, to be taken during the Xmas holidays, is be ing arranged. Teams will be played at Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Memphis, St. Louis and Champaign. Girls Hare Place to Practice.

The reason for not trying to get the gymnasium earlier is not given. Arrange ments will be made at once for practice days, and the candidates for the teams will at once begin work under George Reeves, of the Y. M. C. A. team, and Miss Gladys Isehrbas, the captain. M.
