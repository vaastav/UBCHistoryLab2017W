As the beat charity we do but kill, Not succour, when we shudder at the 111: The loathing and the sorrow that not strives Were sorry proof of manhood." It was not long before Singleton reached the tavern, which he now found crowded. The villagers of all conditions and politics had there assembled, either to mutter over their doubts or discontents, or to gather counsel for their course in future, from the many, wiser than themselves, in their own predicament There, also came the true loyalist, certain to find deference and favor from those around him, not so happy qr so secure as himself in the confidence of the existing powers. The group was motley enough, and the moods at work among them not less so. Some had already determined upon submission?some of the weak?the time serving?such as every old (immunity will be found to furnish, where Indolent habits, which have beconfe Inveterate, forbid all sort of independence. Some fluctuated, and knew not what to do. or even what to think. But there were others. Singleton imagined. as he looked Into their grave, sullen features, full of thought and pregnant with determination, who felt nothing so strongly as the sense of injustice, and the rebel-daring which calls for defiance at every haxard. "Vengeance! my men!" he muttered to himself, as passing full into the apartment, he became at once visible ' to the group. The old landlord himself was the first person who confronted him, speaking still aftar that familiar fashion which had already had its rebuke from the same quarter. "Ah. captai^ji! (the brow of Singleton darkened)?squire, I mean. I ask pardon, squire; but here, where every man is a captain, or a colonel, or something, it comos natural to captain or colonel all. and is not often amiss. No offense, amiire?If* use onlv. and I mean no harm." "Enough, enough! good master landlord! Least said, soonest mended. Shall we soon have supper?" The ready publican turned to the Inner door of the apartment and put the same question to his daughter, the fair Bella; then, without waiting for her reply,- Informed the Inquirer that many minutes would not elapse before it would be on the table. "Six o'clock's the time of day for supper, squire?six for supper?one for dinner?eight for breakfast?punctual to the stroke, and no waiting. Heh! what's that you say. Master Dickenson??what's that about Frampton?" said old Humphries, turning to one of the villagers who had just entered the apartment. The person so addressed came forward; a thin-Jawed, sallow countryman, whose eyes were big with the intelligence he brought, and who seemed anxious that a well-dressed and goodly looking stranger, like Singleton, should have the benefit of his burden. "Why, gentlemen, the matter with Frampton's strange enough. You all know he's been out several days, close in the swamp. He had a fight, stranger, you see, with one of Huck's dragoons; and he licked the dragoon, for all the world, as if he'd a licked him out of his skin. Now the dragoon's a strong fellow enough; but Frampton's a horse, and if ever he mounts you the game is up. for there's no stopping him t when he gets his hand in. So. as I tell you. the dragoon stood a mighty slim Hp first brought him down with a back-handed wipe, that came over his cheek for all the world like the slap of a water-wheel?" "Yes. yes. we all heard that; but what was It all about. Dickenson??we don't know that, yet." cried one of the group which had now formed around * the speaker. "Why, that's soon told. The dragoon went to Frampton's house when he was In the swamp, and made free with what he wanted. Big Barney, his eldest son. went off In the meanwhile to his daddy, and off he came full tilt, with Lance, his youngest lad along with him. You know Lance, or Lancelot, a smart chap of sixteen; you've seed him often enough." "Yes, yes. we know, him." "Well, as I tell you. the old man and his two boys came full tilt to the house, and 'twas a God's mercy they came In time, for the doings of the dragoon was too ridiculous for any decent body to put up with, and the old colt couldn't stand it no how; so, as I tell you, he put it to him in short order. He first gave him a back-handed wipe, which flattened him. I tell you; and when the sodger tried to get up, he put it to him again so that it was N easier for him to lie down than to stand up; and lie down he did, without a word, till the other dragoons tuk him up. They came a few minutes after. and the old man and the youngest boy, Lance, had a narrow chance and m a smart run for it. They heard the troops coming down the lane, and they took to the bush. The sodgers tried hard to catch them, but it ain't easy to hook a Goose Creeker when he's on .. trail for the swamp, and splashing after the hogs along a tussock. So they got safe into the Cypress, and the dragoons had nothing better to do than go back to the house. Well, they made Frampton's old woman stand all sorts of treatment, and that too bad to find names for. They beat her too. and she as heavy as she could go. Well, then, she died night afore last, as might be expected; and now the wonder is, what's become of her body. They laid her out; and the old granny that watched her only went into the kitchen for a little while, and when she came back the body was gone. She looked out of the window, and sure Lmerican Revolution ORE 8IMMS enough she sees a man going over the rail with a bundle all in white on his shoulder. And the man looked, so she swears, for all the world like old Frampton himself. Nobody knows anything more about it; and what I heard, is Jist now what I tell you." The man had narrated truly what he had heard; and what, in reality, with little exaggeration, was the truth. The company had listened to one of those stories of brutality, which?in the fierce civil warfare of the south, when neighbors were arrayed against one another, and when, on one side, negroes, and Indians formed allies, contributing, by their lighter sense of humanity, additional forms of terror to the sanguinary warfare pursued at that period? were of almost dally occurrence. Huck, the Infamous Tory captain, of whom we have already obtained a slight glimpse In the progress of our narrative. was himself a character well fitted, by his habitual cunning and gross want of all the softening influences of humanity, to give countenance, and even example, to crimes of this nature. His dragoons, though few as yet in number, and employed only on marauding excursions calling for small parties, had already become notorious for their outrages of this description. Indeed, they found impunity in this circumstance. In regular warfare, under the controlling presence of crowds, the responsibility of his men, apart from what they owed or yielded to himself, would have held them certainly in some greater restraints; although, to their shame be it said, the British generals in the south, when mortified by defeat and vexed by unexpected resistance, were themselves not always more ten- | aclous of propriety than the Tory Huck. The sanguinary orders of Cornwallis. commanding the cold blooded execution of hundreds, are on record, in melancholy attestation of the atrocities committed by the one, and the persecutions borne by the other party, during this memorable conflict. It could easily be seen what was the general feeling during this recital; and yet that feeling was unspoken. Some few shook their heads very gravely, and a few, more daring yet, ventured to say, that "it was very bad, very bad indeed?very shocking!" "What's very bad. my friends? what Is it you speak of as so shocking?" w.is the demand of one just entering. The crowd started back, and Huck himself stood among them. He repeated his inquiry, and with a manner that left it doubtful whether he really desired to know what had been the subiect of their remarks, or whether, hav ingr heard, he wished to compel some of them to the honest utterance of their sentiments upon it. Singleton, who had listened with a duly excited spirit to the narrative of the countryman. now advanced deliberately to| wards the new-co?mer, whom he addressed as In answer of his question? "Why, sir, it is bad, very bad indeed, the treatment received, as I learn, by one of his majesty's dragoons, at the hands of some impudent rebel a few nights ago. You know, sir, to what I allude. You have heard, doubtless." The bold, confident manner of the speaker was sufficiently imposing to satisfy all around of his loyalty Huck seemed completely surprised, and replied freely and with confidence? "Ay, you mean the affair of that scoundrel, Frampton. Yes, I know all about it; but we're on his trail, and shall soon make him sweat for his audacity. the blasted rebel." "Do you know that his wife is dead?" asked one of the countrymen, in a tone subdued to one of simple and Inexpressive inquiry. "No?and don't care very greatly. It's a bad breed, and the misfortune Is, there's quite too many of them. But we'll thin them soon, and easily, by G?d! and the land shall be rid of the reptiles." "Yes. captain, we think alike." said Singleton, familiarly?"we think alike on that subject. Something must De (lone, and in time, or there will be no comfortable moving for a loyalist, whether in swamp or highway. These rascal rebels have It in their power to do mischief. If not taken care of in time. It Is certainly our policy to prevent our men from being ill-treated by them, and to do this, they must be taken In hand early. Rebellion grows like joint grass when it once takes root, and runs faster than you can follow. It should be seen to." "That is my thought already, and accordingly I have a good dog on trail of this lark, Frampton, and hope soon to have him in. He cannot escape Travis, my lieutenant, who Is now after him, and who knows the swamp as well as himself. They're both from Goose Creek, and so let dog eat dog." "You have sent Travis after him, then, captain?" inquired a slow and deliberate voice at Huck's elbow. Sin gleton turned at the same moment with the person addressed, and recognized In the speaker his own lieutenant. the younger Huhiphries, who had gone back to the tavern almost as soon as himself. Humphries, of whose Americanism we can have no sort of question, had yet managed adroitly to conceal it: and what with his own cunning and his father's established loyalty. he was enabled, not only to pass without suspicion, but actually to impress the Tories with a favorable opinion of his good feeling for the British cause. This was one of those artifices which the necessities of the times imposed upon most men, and for which they gave a sufficient moral sanction. "Ah. Bill, my boy," said Huck, turning as to an old acquaintance. "Is that you! Why, where have you been?? haven't seen you for an age, and didn't well know what had become of you? thought you might have gone into the swamps too with the skulking rebels." "So I have," replied the other calmly ?"not with the rebels though. I see none of them to go with?but I have been skirting the cypress for some time, gathering what pigs the aliiga tors found no use for. Pigs and poul try are the rebels I look after. Yo? may Judge of my success by their bawl ings." In confirmation of what Humphrle: had said, at that moment the collectloi of tied pigs with which his cart ha< been piled and the tethered chickeni undergoing transfer to a more flxe< dwelling, and tumbled from the masi where they had quietly but confusedl; lain for an hour or two before?sen up a most piteous pleading?which, to the time, effectually silenced the speak ers within. A moment's pause obtain ed, Humphries reverted, though lndl rectly, to the question which he ha< put to the Tory captain touching ftii pursuit of Frampton by Travis; and without exciting: his suspicion by t positive inquiry, strove to obtain information. "Travis will find Frampton if h? chooses?he knows the swamp quite ai well?and a lean dog: for a long chase you know?that Is, if you have giver him men enough." "I gave him all he wanted; ten. he said, would answer; he could have hac more. He'll catch him, or I'm mistaken." "Yes, If he strikes a good route. The old paths are washed now by the freshet, and he may find it hard to keej track. Now. the best path for him tc take, captain, would have been up over Terrapin Bridge by Turkey Town. Thai will bring him right into the heart ol the swamp, where it's most likely Frampton hides." "Terrapin Bridge?Turkey Town,' said the other, seeming to muse. "No he said nothing of these places; he spoke of?" "Droze's old field," exclaimed Humphries, somewhat eagerly. "Yes, that's the name; he goes thai route; and I remember he spoke of smother, where he said the waters were too high." "Ay?and does he think to find Frampton on the skirts??and then " hot o rniin^.flhnnt w?v hv DrOze's! eh! neighbors??he can't be there before midnight. But of course he wenl there in time." said Humphries, insinuating the question. "Only two hours gone," replied th? other, giving the desired intelligence: "but he won't do more thar stretch to the swamp tonight. He wants to be ready to make a dash with the duylight upon them, when he hopes tc find the fellow not yet out of his nest.' Humphries looked approvingly as he heard the plan. He exchanged glances of intelligence at intervals with Singleton. who listened attentively to this dialogue, which had wormed out the secret of one of those little adventures of Huck's party, In which his command was most generally employed. The look of Singleton spoke clearly to Humphries his desire to have a hand in the performance which was now naturally suggested to both. The lieutenant, eager like his superior, was yet prudenl enough to keep his countenance. They both looked unconcerned enough, and now remained silent. Huck, in the meantime, who had long been desirous of securing Humphries for his troop, now pressed the lattet more earnestly than ever upon thai subject. Taking him aside, he detailed to him In an undertone the thousand advantages of profit and position which must result to him from coming out in arms for his majesty, and In his Captain Huck's, particular command ol cavalry. It was amusing to observt how much stronger became his anxietj whenever his eye rested upon the fornr of Singleton, whom he now regarded ir the light of a rival leader. The eye ol young Humphries, also, glanced frequently in the same direction, as, frorr a previous knowledge of the charactei of Singleton, he felt how impatient ht would be until he could make the attack, which he saw he contemplated upon the marauding party which had been sent out under Travis. It was ir such little adventures that the partlsar warfare of Carolina had Its origin. Humphries, closely pressed by Huck had yet Ingenuity enough to evade his application without offending his prldt or alarming his suspicions. He mad( sundry excuses, simply as to time leaving the Tory to infer that in th< end the recruit would certainly be his. "You will soon have to come out, Bill my boy; and dang it but there's n< better chance than you have in mj troop. You shall be my right hanc man. for I know you, old fellow? and blast me, but I'd sooner trust yot than any chap of the corps. I may ai well put you down." "No, not yet: I'll be ready to answei you soon, and I can easily make mj preparations. You have arms a plen ty?" "Soon shall have. Three wagons an on their way from Charleston wltl sabres and pistols especially for us." "I shall no doubt want some of them and you shall then hear from me There 1h time enough In all next week.' "Yes. but be quick about It, oi there will be no picking; and then yov have but twenty days, remember. Th< proclamation gives but twenty days and then Cornwall Is has sworn to trea as rebels, with the utmost severity o the law. all those who are not in armi for his majesty?just the same as 1 they had fought against him. See, have it here." He took from his pocket the procla nation, and with It a private ordei which was Issued by the commander in-chief to all the subordinate com mands, giving directions for the utmos severity, and prescribing the mode o punishment for the refractory, neari; in the language, and to the full effect of Huck's representations. Humphrle looked grave enough at these crowdini evidences, but resisted, by well urgei evasions, the exhortations of the temp ter. The Tory captain was compelle< to rest satisfied for the present, assur ed that he had held forth especial in v ducements to thf country man whicl must give his troops a preference ove any claims that might be set up by th rival recruiting officer, as he consider ed Singleton. With a hearty shake o the hand, and a few parting word? ii whisper to his companion, he left th hotel to make his way?a subtle syco phant with his superiors?to the pres ence of Major Proctor of the Dor Chester garrison, from whom he ha received his commission. Singleton, while this episode of Hum phries and the Tory had been going or employed himself In occasional conver sation with the landlord and sundr i of the villagers in another end of th i apartment. In this conversatior though studiously selecting topics o I - a nature not to startle or offend the 1 fears or the prejudices of any, he con trlved, with no little Ingenuity to bAng about, every now And then, occasional b expressions of their feelings and oplni Ions. He saw, from these few and 1 brief evidences, that their feelings were b not with their rulers?that they sub1 scribed simply to a hard necessity, b and would readily seek the means of / relief, did they know where to find It. t He himself took care, while he uttered r nothing which could be construed Into - an offence against loyalty, to frame - what he did say In such a guise that It - must have touched and ministered 1 largely to the existing provocations. b He could see this In the burning In, dignatlon strong In every countenance^ i as he dwelt UDon the lmDeratlve neces slty they were now under of taking: up arms In obedience to the proclamation. t His urging: of this topic was, like that i of Huck. ostensibly the obtaining of , recruits for the contemplated troop, i His policy was one frequently acted upon In that strange warfare, In which i the Tories, when defeated, found few I conscientious scruples to restrain them from falling into the ranks and becoming good soldiers along with their coni querors. Such devices as that which he now aimed to practise were freely ) resorted to; and the case was not un> common of a troop thus formed under the eye of the enemy, and, In his belief, t to do the battles of the monarch, movf Ing off, en masse, the first opportunity, ' and Joining with their fellow countrymen, as well In flight as In victory. ' Such, however, was scarcely now the A# tVio otroncrari Via almnlv Houlr. > ed that his loyalty might pass unquestioned; and he put on a habit, there fore, as a disguise, which but too many natives wore with far less scruple, and i perhaps with some show of grace. It may be said, as highly gratifying to i Singleton, that In the character thus assumed he made no converts. ' But the bell for supper was now ring ing, and, taking his way with the rest, he passed Into the inner apartment Bella Humphries presided, her brother taking a seat at the other end of the tablev and ministering to the guests in that quarter. Singleton was assigned a seat, possibly by way of distinction, close to the maiden, who smiled graciously at his approach. Still she looked not so well satisfied. Neither of her squires was present, and her eye wandered from side to side among unattractive countrymen at the table, resting at last, as with a dernier hope, upon the manly and handsome face and person of our adventurer. The coquette must be busy. It is her necessity. She has smiles to circulate, and, like the counterfeiter with false coin, she is ever on the lookout for the flat. While she watched Singleton with ready smiles, he had an opportunity of scanning her features more narrowly. She was very girlish, certainly very youthful In appearance, and her face was decidedly handsome. He saw, at a glance, that she was incapable of any ' of that settled and solemn feeling which belongs to love, and which can only ex; 1st along with a strongly marked chart acter and truly elevated sentiments. Her desire was that of display and i conquest made the chief agent to this end. It mattered not how doubtful was the character of her captives, so that they were numerous; and Singleton felt assured that his simple Goose Creek convert, Davis, but for the lack of red coat and command, stood quite as good a chance In the maiden's heart as the more formidable sergeant. How long he would have scanned the features which seemed not unwilling to at tract his eye, we may not say; but his gaze was at length disturbed by the entrance of Davis, who. taking his seat at the opposite corner of the table, now appeared In a better and a more conciliatory humor. He addressed some country compliment to Bella, which she was not displeased to listen to, as she was perfectly satisfied to have a swain,, no matter who, In the absence pi the greater favorite. She answered some few remarks of Singleton and Davis with a pretty, childish simplicity, which showed that, after all, the misfortune of the girl was only a deficiency In the more interesting points of character, and not the presence of any improper or wanton state of feeling. Meantime the supper proceeded. Towards Its conclusion, Humphries, the brother, giving Davis a look and a sign, which the latter seemed to comprehend, left the apartment. Davis followed him. They were gone about a quarter of an hour, which time was spent by Singleton In a lively chat with the girl, when, through the window, he saw the face of a man. and the motion of a hand, which beckoned him. a In a moment after the person was i gone: and, suffering some few seconds olnntio Slne-laton also rnse and obey , ed the signal. He took his way into .. the yard, and under the shadow of a tree, at a little distance from the house, r distinguished the person of the younger i Humphries. Singleton at once api proached him?the other motioned sli, lence, seeing him about to speak, and t led him to the stable, where all was f perfectly in shadow. 3 "We are safe now," said he. Slnglef ton immediately addressed him, and I with some show of impatience, on a subject which had much employed his - thoughts during the past hour. ( "Well, Humphries, say, can we not . strike at that fellow Tracy? Is it . possible to do anything with his det tachment?" f "Travis, not Tracy, major," replied y the other. "It is possible, sir: and there is a strong chance of our success s If we manage well, and if you can postT ruin a crnlritr tf? 'The Onlu' tnnlirht." 3 "True," said the other: "I should - like very much to go there; but this 3 movement of Tracy?or Travis, you - say?gives us a good beginning, which - we ought on no account to miss. Beh sides, we should put your men on their i* guard. Are they not In some danger?" e "Not if they watch well; but there's - no answering for new hands. They f must have practice before they can learn, and down here, they've had but e little yet. They're not like your San tee boys I've heard you tell of." "Willing soon will!" said the other. - "But let us move. I'll say no more of d 'The Oaks' tonight at least. We can move there tomorrow. Of course you - lead the route, for I know nothing t. about It." "Trust to me; and, major, go back to y the house quietly. Walt till you hear e my whistle three times?thus. It's an i. old signal, which you'll have to leam f here, as our little squad all knows It, ' and knows nothing: else by way of music. Meantime I'll get things In readiness. and set Davis to carry out the horses to the bush." "Is he resolved to go with us?" was Singleton's question. "True as steel. A little weak o' heart, sir, about that foolish girl?but that's all the better, for It makes him hate the British the more. Here he comes. You had better go now, major, and let us be as little seen together as may be. You'll mind the whistle?thus, three times;" and In a low tone Humphries gave him the signal. Singleton went towards the house. In the shadow of which he was soon lost from sight, while Humphries and Davis proceeded to the farther arrangement of the enterprise. It was not long before this was completed, and with a rush of pleasure to his heart, Major Singleton heard the thrice-uttered note?the signal agreed upon?directly beneath his chamber window. He rose at the sound, and silently descending the stairs, passed through the hall, where, In something like uncomfortable solitude, the fair Bella sat alone. She looked up as she heard his footsteps, and the gracious smile which her Hps put on, was an Invitation to make himself happy In a seat beside her. But he resisted the blandishment, and lifting his hat as he passed, with a smile In return, he soon disappeared from her presence, and joined the two who awaited him. All was ready for departure, but Davis craved a few minutes' Indulgence to re- ' turn to the house. "Why, what should carry you back. Davis?" asked Humphries, peevishly. "Nothing, Bill: but I must?I will go." said the other. "I see, I see; you will be as foolish as ever," exclaimed the former, as the lover moved away. "The poor fellow's half mad after my sister, major, and she, you see, ? -A V> A. U1M Oka Qon i care a straw auuui mm. one happened to smile on him at supperjtable, and he takes It for granted he's in a fair way. We must wait for him, I suppose, and if I know Bella, he won't keep us long." Meanwhile, the seat beside her, which her smile had beckoned Major Singleton to occupy, had been eagerly filled by Davis. The girl was not displeased to see him; she was lonesome, wanted company, and like all other coquettes do, to have continually In her presence some one or other of the many subjects of her dally conquest. It did not much concern her which, so that she was allowed to carry on her pretty little practice. Her graciousness softened very rreatly the moody spirit of her swain, Sp that he half-repented of that rashness which was about to place him in a position calculated, under every probability, to wrest him, for a time at least, from the enjoyment of that sofclety which he so much coveted. Her gentleness, her good-nature, her smiles ?so very unfrequent to him for so long a time?almost turned his brain, iCWT his professions of lOVtf grew passionate. and he himself almost eloquent In their utteraftce. Surely, there is no tyranny like that of love, since it puts us so completely in subjection to the character which deliberate reason would teach us to despise. But in the midst of his pleading, and while she regarded him with her most gracious smile, the voice of the ob trusive Sergeant Hastings was heard In the tap-room, and the sweet passages of love were at once over between the couple. "As rocks have been rent asunder" , was their new position. The maiden drew her chair a foot back from its place, and when Davis looked into her face, and beheld the corresponding change in its expression, he rose up, with a bitter curse in his throat, which he was nevertheless too well behaved j to utter. He wanted no better evidence of her heartlessness, and with a look which said what his tongue could not have spoken, he seemed to warn Iter that he was lost to her forever. His , determination was at length complete, and rapidly passing the luckier sergeant. who now entered the apartment he was soon again in company with the ( two he had left In waiting. Humphries smiled as he saw the desperate manner of his comrade, but nothing was said, and the thfee together made their way on foot, till, leaving the village, they entered the forest to the right, and found the clump of trees to which their horses had been fastened. In a moment they were mounted and speed- ( Ing with the wind towards the close and scarcely penetrable estuary known as the Cypress Swamp, forming a spaclous reservoir for the Ashley, from which, by little and little, winding as it goes, it expands at length, a few miles below, into a noble and navigable river.

CONTINUED. A Curious Wedding Custom. If in the Village of Tigara, in northwestern Alaska, one sees a young man beating out a piece of metal and fashioning a finger ring, it is usually intended for some young woman: but it remains for the meeting of the two mothers to arrange matters. The two families may be living close together, yet the mother of the young mnn will call on her neighbor and tell her how she has intended to be more neighborly, but she has been so busy. The neighbor will declare how delighted she is to see her. Then Mother No. 1 begins to tell what a great hunter her son is, and how good he is. Mother No. 2 re- , marks that her daughter Is such a lovely cook. Having taken lessons, she knows how to cook everything. Mother No. 1 declares that they are never hungry In their Igloo, as her son is always successful and brings lots of j seals home. Mother No. 2 remarks that her daughter Is such a good sewer, and knows how to chew a beautiful boot sole. It Is finally decided that the young man shall enter the girl's family on a sort of trial. If the girl turns up her nose and makes faces he may as well leave, as the match will never amount to anything; but should she greet him with an occasional smile and allow him to sit by her side In the evening; It will all be clear sailing, and they will unite as husband and wife.

PRESIDENT'S ME83AGE. Comprehensive Epitome of Important Document. The message of President Roosevelt read before the second session of the flfty-nlnth congress, consists of nearly 25.000 words. Only twenty-five words are devoted to the Panama canal. A special message will he sent congress later dealing with this most absorbing question. For the first time In many years the message-deals more with the past thar the future. A feature of the message le the simplified form of spelling and ie one of the first official documents given to the public since this abbreviated method was adopted. His first recommendation is that in future inexorable laws be enacted prohibiting corporations from contributing to political campaigns. The second paragraph of the message deals with the government's right of appeal In criminal cases and embodies an earnest plea for such laws af win give the government this privilege. The practice of setting aside Judgments and granting new trials is vigorously condemned by the president. The president contends that the right of Injunction In labor cases should be abolished and he declares It an instrument which Is savagely abused In many instances. The duties, as well as the good opportunities, of judges are discussed in detail and the president makes an especial plea for a higher and more effective judiciary throughout the country. Lynching Is condemned In the most emphatic language and the race riot In Atlanta is pointed to as one of the evil results of race passion. As a remedy for race hatred and a preventive for lynching the president points to early school training and manual education of both races. Capital anl labor are discussed at ?reat length, with remedies suggested and moral lessons pointed out. The message declares that much of the friction between the employer and the employee Is the result of the work ol the demagogue and urges that the two classes get on better terms of acquaintanceship. The eight-hour law Is approved In the United States, but shown to be very undesirable In Panama, where the conditions and men are totally different. The labor of women and children In sweatshops and factories Is scored and better and more stringent laws against It urged. The liability of the employer is given especial attention by the president and pertinent suggestions made in reference to who shall share the responsibility for accident to the employee. The president believes prompt and B^archlng Inquiries should always be made Tn disputes between capital and labor, and arbitration employed wherever possible. The president Insists that coal lands, Btlll owned by the government, should be held and leased to miners or i royalty basis. Several pages of the message are devoted to a review of the term corporation, the general effects of trusts and the legislation already Inaugurated to permit the possibility of competition. The message endorses the Inheritance tax and approves the tax on incomes, The president states that the rich man Is under a peculiar obligation to the government for protection which the poor man does not owe. Technical and Industrial training are urged as the best foundation for the young man and the young woman to build for the future. The tiller of the soil, the mechanic ^r.d all others who earn their bread bj .he sweat of their brow are given earnest advice. Irrigation and forest preservations are briefly mentioned. The president cordially endorses the movement to build a memorial amphitheatre at Arlington for use of the (Irand Army of the Republic on memorial days.

LION HUNT IN ZAMBE8I. 1 Unique Armament of a Body of Hunters?Death of a Man Eater. i Far away on the confines of the , northernmost Praza of Portuguese Zambesia lies a little village nestling among the trees at the foot of a huge rock. Like other native villages In this part of Africa It consists of a few , round huts placed anyhow in a more or less Imperfectly cleared space In the forest and is inhabited by a happy, careless population. One May morning it was the scene ( of a fearful tragedy, only too common In such villages. Four men had been hoeing In the mealle patch along the side of a neighboring kloof, when suddenly, says a correspondent of the London Field, a lioness sprang among them, seized one man by the leg and endeavored to drag him away. Whatever vices these natives may .have, cowardice Is not one. Two attacked the lioness with their hoes and were ?..Ud malaa A lllKllllunv nmuiru 111 lire urerev. <> third took up his bow and sent two arrows into her side. It was of no avail. The lioness stuck to her quarry, and carried him off, shrieking: with agony, which was mercifully - ended by his d^ath, and the horrified villagers carried the survivors back to their homes and applied such remedies to their hurts as their , limited knoweldge of medicine dictated.. The hunting men went out to , track the animal to her liar; the oth> era rapidly erected a stockade around , the village, long experience of similar occurrences having taught them the futility of delay in this matter; the appetite for human flesh, when once , cultivated Is never appeased and the , raids of a man eating lion can only be ended by Its death. It happened that next day five white , men found their way to the village. I They were new to the country and not i long out from home, and all being keen sportsmen they naturally jumped at the chance of having some excitement and ridding the country of such a pest as well. On their arrival they *ad a lengthy indaba with the head man and were promised the help of I the entire male population of the vtli lage as beaters If they would go out 1 and kill the lioness. The bow and arrow champion of the previous day agreed to act as grulde. and daylight next morning saw a lengthy procession , following a fairly evident blood spoor i from the garden Into the bush. I must now describe the men and their armament, as the latter Is probably unique in the annals of African a loo ft nhnrt I1UI1 OllUUklllg.

Behind him stalked a i doughty heathen carrying a second rli fle. a Lee-Metford carbine, loaded, at full cock, and with the cutoff open. B, a large edition of A. was with the exi ceptlon of the knife similarly armed and had also an attendant carrying a > second rifle. Next in order came X. wearing a i white helmet and armed with a LeeMetford rifle and a revolver, a fiery man, keen aa mustard and eager for i the fray. Y followed him, a man of ! elephantine build, whose rubicund countenance glowed with excitement. ' Z. armed similarly to the others, took i up the rear. Behind followed a mixed crowd carrying shotguns, spears, axes, knobkerles, cameras on stands, luncheon baskets and other impedimenta i eagerly scanning the bush and ready to drop their loads and clear at the first ( sign of danger. The bow and arrow man In his capacity as guide led them ! to an open space In the forest. Near Its centre was a clump of tall grass and on one side and to their rear was a pool of water. Into the grass the blood 1 spoor led. "Allpo!" (he Is in there!) saltf the bow and arrow man. 1 A hurried consultation followed. It was decided to advance on the clump In column and to deploy to the left In 1 front of It. while the beaters from the 1 other side drove the brute out Into a semi-circle of rifles. The manoeuvre 1 began. With all rifles at full cock, A ' led the column toward the clump of grass, then turning: to the left pro1 ceeded to take up his position. B followed. Conspicuous by his white headgear, X approached too near the grass. There was a sudden rustle, a couple of bounds, a magnificent spring and*a huge lioness dashed at him. 1 He received her on the muzzle of his rifle, holding It at the ready, as if to repel a bayonet attack. Though It 1 raked her from stern to stern the bullet missed her heart. Simultaneously A's and B's rifles cracked, or rather boomed. The beast died In midair as she made her spring. She fell on X laying him out on the ground. She never even twitched a muscle, but X's troubles were by no means over. A tremendous fusillacfe from all rifles except those carried by A and B was opened on the corpse as It lay on top | of X. One boy completely emptied his magazine before the firing was stopped. X was extricated, shaken but not hurt, and unscathed by bullets. i W It Is calculated that we burn i 350,000,000 tons of coal every year In I this country, which costs the consumi ers approximately $700,000,000. <t'T it has been computed by geographers that if the sea were emptied of Its waters and all the rivers of the I earth were to pour their present floods Into the vacant space, allowing nothing . for evaporation, 40,000 years would be i required to bring the water of the . ocean up to Its present level.

8ADDE8T WAR 8T0RY. Declared to Be That of the Returning 8oldier Killed by Hie Father. "The saddest war story that ever occurred has never been fully told so far as I know," said a man who followed Lee to the surrender at Appomattox. "I believe that Mrs. Chest- * nut in her 'Diary from Dixie' made a brief mention of the Incident. "I had forgotten it until I read the book. Then it came back to me as I heard It from one who was at the funeral. The man who told It died twenty years ago. "The soldier had enlisted in Georgia from his home, where his father remained undisturbed during the struggle. The young man had fought through the war without a scratch, save a slight wound which had left him slightly deaf. This affliction he had never referred to In any of his letters. "After the surrender he communicated with his father, saying he would reach home on or about a certain date. Travel then was uncertain and he was not positive as to when he would arrive. "His father prepared to receive him. Believing that his son would come as promised, he arranged a spread such as the conditions of his surroundings at that time would permit. He had brought out his best plate that had been secreted for a long time, and with gold which had been exhumed he bought such delicacies and substantial as the southern market afforded. "As many of the old time neighbors as were living In the vicinity were invited to the home-coming of the returning soldier. The ex-Confederate arrived on the old plantation the night before the earliest date he had mentioned in his last letter. It was late and his father and the family had retired. "The only creature on the old place that seemed to be awake was a dog. As the soldier entered the gate of the grounds the dog began barking. "The sound aroused the owner of the manor. The country was overrun at the time with stragglers, some of whoqi had not hesitated to commit burglary. , "Tne rattier or tne returning ooy arose. He stood In his doorway with his shotgun and challenged the approaching stranger, as he supposed. "The young man being deaf made no reply, but continued on his way. The man In the doorway raised his gun and flred. The stranger fell dead. "The father summoned his family and the few remaining servants of the plantation. An investigation was held and the tragic truth was revealed. "The father, of course, was inconsolable. He returned to his house while the servants carried the lifeless form of his boy to the home that had been-a waiting-Ms Loiiiln^P"1 ' ? "The next day the Invited guests began to arrive. The father had given orders that the tragedy should not be mentioned until he himself told It. "I do not recall what explanation was made to the guests as to the absence of him whom they were to honor. But after the repast they were told, and then filed past the dead. The body was wrapped In the flag for which the brave young man had fought The community was used to funerals. Every private burial ground had a grave made by the unhappy war. But no funeral like this had ever taken place In the vicinity, and I doubt if It ever had a counterpart In * any state, north or south. I hope not."?New York Sun. COURT BAN ON 8PELLINQ. ? Chief Justice Fuller Objects te "Thru" In a Quotation. The United States supreme court has gone against the simplified spelling system, and the indications after the first round are that the simplified spelling system is leaning against the ropes, groggy, says a Washington special to the New York Times. The supreme court always does those things in a fine and delicate way. without any shedding of blood or mussing up of scenery, so that it sometimes takes the victim a day or two to ascertain that he is really down and out. It happened while the case of Dalcour against the United States was under consideration. Solicitor General Hoyt was presenting the government's side, and he was reading from a brief which was fairly studded with such words as "dropt" and "fantdsy" and "klst." Chief Justice, with a copy of the brief in hand, followed the reading gravely. He read "thru" and "thruout" and "fantom" and "flxt" and not a single expression flitted across his face. Presently the brief arrived at a long quotation from a decision rendered some years ago by Justice Bradley. The simplified word that Mr. Hovt met in his reading from this was "thru." Hardly was the word out of his mouth before the chief justice stopped him. "Is this." said the chief justice, in the tone of gentle, suave inquiry which puts experienced counsel on guard, "supposed to be a quotation from Justice Bradley's official opin- . ion?" 'i'!| Mr. Hoyt looked up, startled. He hurriedly scanned the quotation to see what was wrong, and his eye lighted on the word he had just read. He flushed and fidgeted. "Yes, sir; In all except the spelling," he blushlngly replied. "Ah-h-h-h-h!" replied the chief justice, with a long, rolling inflection, inserting five h's In a word that Is supposed to have only one. The rest of the justices grinned, and so did everybody else in the courtmnm. Mr. Hovt discerned the dan ger signal and hurriedly jumped off the track. "Hereafter," he said, "I will see to It that nothing of this kind occurs. While we follow the president's order in preparing original briefs, I do not feel that we are Justified in changing the orthography of judicial opinions, and I will see that It does not happen again." So ended the first round, and the memory of Justice Bradley was protected. The next round is awaited with interest. t*" An elephant has so delicate a sense of smell that when in a wild state it can scent an ememy at a distance of 1,000 yards.
