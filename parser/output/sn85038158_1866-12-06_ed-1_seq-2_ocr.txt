niLi.vitououu, onto t Thursday, - Doc. 6, 186G. Congress. Congress amombled last Monday At noon, The President's niVAsngo wn received and read In both Houses. In the Senate no other buslnoss of ltnportano was transact ed. In the lTotiM several Important bills vere Introduced one by Mr. Eliot, of Massachusetts, depriving the President of power to pardon rebels one by Mr. Bout- well, of Mass., directing the Secretary of the Treasury to sell 12,000,000 In gold Weekly, Bills were also In trod need providing for the meeting of the Fortieth Congress on the 24th of March next, making It unlaw ful for persons rejected by the Senate to hold office, and providing for the appoint ment of revenue officers by Chief Justice Chase. President's Message. The Message was delivered to both Houses on Monday. It Is of reasonable length, and well jvrltton, for which merits it la probably indebted to the good taste Mr. Johnson says he has seen no reason to change his views on "Reconstruction," and still thinks At policy the true one, lie, however, refers to Congress In a re spectful tone, quite different from that of bis speeches, when "swinging round the circle," last fall before the elections, and closes his Message with the hope that "har mony" may be preserved "between the co-ordinate Departments of the Govern ment," and "that each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operate with the other." Which is all very proper, and may easily be effected, whenever Mr. Johnson is ready to acquiesce In the will of the people, as expressed at the ballot-box, and give hit sanction and support to the declared poli cy of Oongrem. Mahomet will have to go to the mountain, not the mountain to Ma homet. In regard to Mexico, the President In forms ns that he has sent Minister Camp bell to that country, to assume his official functions, in consequence of the expected departure of the French troops, promised by Napoleon to begin on Nov. 1st. The Emperor not having kept his promise, our Government has stirred him up on the subject, and the President hopes he will yet "meet our Just expectations" by com plying with his agreement as soon as prac ticable.. Meantime, Lieut. Gen. Sherman has been sent with Minister Campbell, "with the view of obtaining such Informa tion as might be important to determine the course to be pursued by the U. States," Ac. We will publish the Message In full in our next issue The safe of Sturgess & Green, millers, at Duncan's Falls, Ohio, was blown open the other night. The thieves carried off ninety-three cents belonging to the Temperance Society of the town, but overlooked a $500 United States bond placed, between the loaves of the day-book. Rer. W. D. Siegfried, a Baptist minister in Philadelphia, and well known In Ohio, who was charged with very unmlnlsterlal conduct by a woman In Philadelphia, has been acquitted by the Court of Quarter Sessions, in that city. The prosecu trix did not appear, it being supposed that she ran away to avoid a suit against her for perjury. Late advices from the City of Mexico state that Marshal Bazaine has furnished arms and ammunition to two Mexican Liberals, with the stipulation that they should be unmolested by the French i r oops If the y would pronounce Gen. Or tega as President of Mexico. Sheridan has ordered the Rio Grande commander not to interfere in Mexican affairs. There is a report there that Max has gone back to the capital, to try to ophold his empire, Tle Oxford Citizen reports ten cases of cholera and deaths, In that place since Tuesday, of laBt week. The dis ease has been confined to the colored population, the first case being a col fired woman from Cincinnati. Three eases are'now under the care of the physicians. News Summary. John IT. Snrratt, one of the conspirators concerned in the assassination of Pres ident Lincoln, has been captured by our Consul in Rgypt, ami will be sent home for trial and punishment. The Fenian excitement In Ireland con tinues, put the reported outbreak is not confirmed. The Government is arresting many of the prominent Fenians, and pre paring to suppress any outbreak with a strong hand. There was really. It seems,' a fins dis play of meteors In England on the 14th of .November, but nothing to be compared to the great shower in thts country in 1833. Head Center Stephens is reported to be In France, directing thenoe the operations f the Brotherhood. It is said, privateers are ready to prey on British Commerce, and that a demonstration agalnnt Canada, tblstims under Stephens' control, will ooo be mack. O. B.

Letter from Washington. . Owing to tho crowded state of our columns last week, we could not find room for the letter of our Washington correspondent. We now publish such portions of It as have not become too old to Interest our readers. 

WASHINGTON CITY, Nov. 25, 1866. Dear News: The Democrats of Now York have done nobly. Thoy have elect ed the greatest yuffHM and proevrionnl gambler In the State, to represent them In Congress. lie has arrived. The .Mem. John Mohrihsrt is at Wlllard's I Won't it be fun, though, to see the lUtle boot-blacks "skedaddle" when he ap proaches them, and hear them whispering to one another, "Pat's de man what kilt folks wld his Asia I" while the tliU of the city will instinctively clutch their pocket books as they pass htm, as if in fear that he may try to regain a portion of the $180, 000 spent to secure his election. Won't ha be an ornament (?) to tho Amer ican Congress f I think they should elect him Speaker, The "mallet" could then be dispensed with, during his term at least. When "order" was required, he could bring his ponder ous fist down ttpon his desk with a force that would shake the floor, and make the very Ink-stands Jump with fear. ' And then he could "settle" all the little Rousseau- slrlnnpll affairs in a moment blacking the eyes of both parties and do it nentty, too t Yes, John Morrissey would make a good Speaker I if tt not pleasant to reflect upon our JJfce Government?" True, Monarchies make Kings of rogues sometimes, 'but we can elect them to clTlce. Talk about Freedom J Who ever enjoyed a "freedom" like this before? A man can travel over the world, flattening people's noses at so much a head, and thns get a "start" sufficient to set up a Faro ' Jlank, and then by that honorable (f) means obtain enough money to buy his way to Congress! The fact of hit election causes one to wonder if our prisons will not next be thrown open, and some, gambling, coun terfeiting, or murder-stained convict be elected to enact laws for us ! ' What has Hon. John Morrissey ever done to gain the confidence of a law-abiding and law-loving people? Ah public nets, so far as I ever heard, have been In opposition to "low and order," while his ill-got money has saved him from a felon's cell, as It has now placed him on an equal footing with the best men of our nation. His election is to say the least, a burning shame, and a blot npon the page of Amer ican HJstory. Well done, modern "Democracy!" Thou bast not, in this instance, belied thyself. ' I predict that the "right of suffrage," In the District of Columbia, will be one of the first bills brought up at the coming session. And although it was defeated in the Senate on Its former presentation, I think it altogether likely that it will be more favorably received this timei One thing is certain, the public mind is better educated to bear it, and I think it . would be received with favor by the majority of citizens here. The "great reform" is nec essary, and therefore, inevitable, and it is meet that It should begin in our National G. H. W. IiiroitTAJfT to Soldiers. Some three months of the time limited by the Department In which to apply for the additional bounty paased by the last Congress, has already expired. Those only can claim payment who ap ply within six months from the begin ning of last August, so that Ohio sol diers should lose no time in putting In their claims to the additional bounty of one hundred dollars. Ohio ix the War. The annual report of Adjutant General Cowan shows that Ohio furnished 310,000 troops of all arms and terms of service, including those who paid commutation, and 6,000 In excess of all calls which places Ohio so much ahead on ' the next war. The Johnson Union Club at Wash ington City have come to grief, the SheriiT having levied on their furniture to pay arrears of rent. i - The Georgia legislature has rejected the constitutional amendment by a un animous vote in the Senate, and by 131 to 2 In the House.
