It's a cold evening when a League can't. be organized now—very. The undying' spirit of patriotism was never stronger than at present. It is so here so it is every Irishmen exist. where—wherever The earnestness shown by the East Siders on Thursday night is a synonim of great good. The new branch starts out under the most favorable circum stances, and will undoubtedly secure a large membership. Henry Grattan Esinonde will repre sent Dublin in her south district in the next Parliament. When his election was announced to the people of that city it was the cause for universal re joicing. All Dublin seemed to have turned out in the general jubilation that followed his succes'4. When the St. Paul syndicate that has bought the Dakota and Great Southern was in Tower City last week, the band sereneded them, and Gov. Marshall re sponded with the assurance that in the spring an army of railroad builders would be at work, and that in less than a year cars would run over the new road. It is not perhaps, out of the way to presume that the North Carolina man, who, in applying for a post-office, ad dressed President Cleveland as "his majesty," lives up in the mountainous region of the state, where a coonskin's worth o'terbacker is bought at a time and where the news of the revolutionary war has not yet found its Way. England borrowed £21,000,001 to abol ish the Irish parliament and then added that amount to Ireland's debt. The borrowed money was expended for the Bribes to members or rifrna inent To suffering loyalists Blood money to informers Judicial tribunals a jtCiar 1,500,000 1.500,000 1,000,000 500,000 500,000 The Pall Mall Gazette, in a leading editorial on Thursday last, urges Mr. Gladstone to arrange matters with Mr, Parnell instantly, so that the Liberals may assume the reins of government, and suggests that Mr. Parnell foe sum moned to Mr. Gladstone's residence at Uawarden to confer with the late pre mier, Lord Roseberry and Earl Spen cer. The Marquis of Lome contested the borough of llampstead in the Liberal interests. "Whether it was because the electors did not wish to be represented by an accidental adjunct of royalty, or whether they were unwilling to trust a man who made such a conspicuous failure in Canada, does not appear, but they rejected him by 075 votes out of a total of 4,595. The popularity of the Marquis is certainly at a very low ebb when so strong a Liberal borough as that of Haroobtead turned its back on him. Canon Farrar, in an address delivered in Music Hall, Boston, last week, en deavored to persuade the American people that England did not desire to witness the dissolution of the Union in our civil war of ISO 1-5. It is entirely too late in the day for an Englishman to make such an assertion in our coun try. To see this country dismembered and the union of the States uissevered would have sent a thrill of delight through every nook and corner of Eng land, despite the hypocritical assertions of Canon Farrar to the contrary. Lady Florence Dixie is writing a series of interesting letters to the Eng lish press, from which the following facts and figures are taken: Before the legislative union Ireland's national debt was £4,000,000 one year of union raised it to £8,000,000 this sum was next amalgamated with the British national debt of £450,000,000, and from that day to this Ireland has been impoverished by being compelled to pay an unfair share on that amalgamated debt, the pre union debt of Great Britain not be ing, as it should have been, separated therefrom. Congressman Hewitt, of New York, is inclined to the belief that the finan cial outlook for the country is deplor able unless some prompt action is taken on the silver questtou. He proposes as soon as congress meets to introduce his bill to secure a uniform standard of value, which provides that gold and silver coins of legal tender value shall be interchangeable at their lawful values and leaves it to the discretion of the Secretary the Treasury to con tinue or limit the coinage of standard silver dollars. The ideas of Mr. Hew itt are good, if they can only be carried into effect 'mm 'WfflgglFg PI .' jp A* J^T St Citizens in Loomis, Mich., are boy cotting the new postmistress by run ning an opposition post. The President's message was laid be fore Congress this week. It is a stud ied and well-written document and bears the stamp of deep thought and earnest, careful consideration. Among the many recommendations set forth is one asking that Congress shall pass a bill which shall hive the effect of pre venting further Mormon immigration to the United States. Wm, H. Vanderbilt is dead. Look ing back over his life there is nothing to recommend him for. The world was full of opportunities for him to do good and his advantages were of that char acter that gave him plenty time to think and act beyond the mere matter of self. He did not. The accumulation of wealth was the ruling passion of his life. In that he achieved success. Be yond that—death and judgment. The time seems to be fairly at hand when even the most faithful believer in human nature doubts the ever plausible story of the iish liar. There is no va cancy, however. The cold weather liar lias been turned loose from his hiding place, and during the early part of the week he easily gained the confidence of the average Minneapolitan and confided to him the fact that the thermometer ranged all the way from 20 to 30 de grees below, when in fact at no time did it drop below 18. Commenting on the closeness of the Ohio Legislature recently elected, the State Journal said in a recent issue: "If any two Republicans vote with the Democrats for senator this winter, they will go down to posterity in more in famy than Booth or Guiteau. In fact, we would not insure their safe exit from this city." Instead of denouncing imaginary crimes in South Carolina and Mississippi, John Sherman might profitably journey to Columbus and condemn the editor who penned this open bid for assassination of any Re publican who refused to obey the crack of the party whip. It is safe to say that the State Journal is not a non partisan paper. A 13-year-old boy, living in the west ern end of the city, says the Louisville Post, has run away from home with the avowed intention of going to the fron tier and becoming a hero. This foolish act is the direct result of a pernicious show which last week held the boards in that city, producing the "Boy Scout." The drama was a lurid, blood and-tlninder play, in which a boy here overcomes supernatural obstacles. It is too much for the vivid imagination of the American youth to expect him to resist such wonderful temptation' There should be some le«f»l. upon,the circulat^^W tli^prescnfra*-'" 'J The following manly words are taken from "The Aristocracy of England'' by William Howitt, an Englishman: "From age to age the Irish have been insulted and taunted with being 'alien blood, language and religion. Great God! What business had we there? What business had we with their lands, their churches, their endowments If we want as Christians to comfort them, why violence and robbery and injustice the means If we went to rule them was it to be only by insult and slaugh ter If we went to bind Ireland to Britain as a sister, was it to be only as an erring sister whose fortune is to be llung into the streets and flung out in her misery In whatever character we pretended to go there, our eyes full of vengeance and our hands full of chains and plunder betrayed us to the whole world as thieves and hypocrites." Lady Florence Dixie says In 1841 the population of Ireland exceeded 8,000,000, and the taxation amounted to £3,507,238. Between 1841 and 1851 lam ine and emigration reduced the popula tion to a little over 0.000,000, yet never thele a taxation steadily rose, and we find it in 1&!>1 to be £4,006,711. In 1861, on a stilt waning population, we find taxation still rising, and standing at £6,420,378. Another ten years roll by, transformations have meanwhile been going on, and taxation amounted to 7,08(5,593 in 1871. At the present day. with j* population of about 5,000,000, taxation is over £8,500,000. Under Home Rule such a state of things would not be allowed. Are Irishmen wrong in asking for that which would relieve them of excessive burdens? But taxation is not theonly inequality borne and suffered by Ireland. She cries for uslice in matters of education, commerce, finance, and expenditure, forms of government and administra tion, all of which are conducted on prin ciples antagonistic to the wishes of the people. THE 

STRUGGLE. The elections stiil continue in Eng land and Ireland. From all returns now in and carefully estimating the few remaining counties yet to vote, the com bined Conservative and Parnellite vote over that of the Liberal party in the next parliament will certainly reach three and perhaps seven majority. This is not large, but it is enough for all in tents and purposes. The English press in its alarm now appeals to the English parties to unite and crush the Irish Na* tional party. Such a coalition is pos sible, not probable, Greed for office, if for no other reason, -would prevent the accomplishment of such a union. Great enthusiasm has manifested itself all over Ireland during the past week A cablegram from Dublin describes an evening's celebration as follows: Had it been possible for a person to stand at midnight on the summit of the Cam Tual of the Kerry Mountains, where he could overlook the whole of Ireland, he might have seen hundreds of bon- DEFECTIVE PAGE t?"' tyth. '*4~, •?!v»?i",'&$' fires kindled over the news that Dublin had returned the entire Nationalist ticket. The news was sent in every direction by telegraph from amid crowds numbering tens of thousands and as madly joyous as Irish enthu siasts ever have been anywhere. The so-called Loyalists at first showed signs of interfering with the popular enthu siasm, but for the most part they went suddenly home. For hours scarcely anything could be heard but the sing ing of "God Save Ireland." One sec tion of the crowd, somewhat over-en thusiastic, broke everv window in Sir Edward Guinness' house, on St. Ste~ phen's Green. Much astonishment was expressed at the large number of American flags seen everywhere. The Conservative Club floated the Union Jack. An immense crowd of Nation alists showed symptoms of going in and tearing it down. The very large police force surrounding the club house prevented this, but the windows were smashed. There was speech making everywhere from impromptu platforms. Messrs. Sullivan and Harrington spoke at several points. The authorities of the Tory Trinity College closed the gates on the students. Nevertheless, a large number of them got out, captured the Star and Stripes and placed them around Grattan's statue, tied with green ribbons. Another flag was soon restored to the place of that which had been appropriated. The bases of the Nelson Pillar and the Grey Monnment in Saekville street were crowded with spectators anxious to obtain a view of the processions, some large and some small, which kept parading the prin cipal thoroughfares. Other large crowds congregated on College Green. Every point of vantage that could be found was eagerly taken possession of. Numbers clung around the pedestal of the Grattan statue and occupied the steps of the Bank of Ireland, clinging to the huge,, allegorical figures. The O'Connell monument, not only the base but the monument itself, was covered with a mass of human beings who cheered, shouted and fired off squibs and rockets in all directions. A Milwaukee Fire. On Thursday morning last, a fire ac companied by an explosion, took place in the Daisy roller mill at Milwaukee, Wis., and spread to the Empire mill, completely destorying both structures, entailing a loss of about $200,000. It is said none of the workmen were in jured, but four firemen were seriously injured by the falling of one of the walls. The origin of the fire, which was discovered in the fifth story, is a complete mystery. The mills were among the oldest in the country, and improvements have year to year pa«"~ -n 11," 4's ,,, -A rt'iJttW «, '}W •.' if^W "lad*1 frn»v jca» on both mills is placed at $200,000. The Empire mill, owned by S. II. Sea mans & Co., carried an insurance of $20,000 on the building and machinery. The walls are stiil standing and can be used in good part in rebuilding. The Daisy mill is totally destroyed. It is insured for about $50,000 on stock. Herman Kuntz, foreman Fire Company No. 2 and treasurer of the Milwaukee Firemen's Releif association, was working on the fifth floor at the time of the explosion, which is supposed to have occured from milldust, and was buried under the debris. It is said that his injuries are fatal. Several other firemen were seriously injured. Death of Wm. H. Vanderbilt. William II. Vanderbilt, wrho died on Tuesday last, was about 65 years of age. At 1 o'clock of that day Mr. CJarrett, President of the Baltimore c% Ohio rail road, called upon Mr. Yanderbilt at his home on Fifth avenue, New York, whereupon a conference took place be tween them upon 1 ail road matters. The two railroad magnates were discussing the new terminal facilities of the Balti more & Ohio, the new inlet into the city it had secured by way of Staten Island, and Mr. Yanderbilt showed a lively interest in the results that were to follow for the island of his birth from the new enterprise. It was while the talk turned upon this, the scenes of his childhood and early work contrast ed with the tremendous achievements of his old age, that Mr. Garrett, sitting on a sofa and facing the millionaire, who leaned forward in his arm-cbair, as was his habit when thoroughly in terested, was suddenly made aware of a slight indistinctness in Mr. Vander bilt's speech that grew into an inarticu late sound. As he leaned over to catch his words, Mr. Vanderbilt pitched for ward without a word of warning and fell heavily on the floor on his face. Mr. Garrett sprang to his feet, with an ex clamation of alarm, and seizing a pil low from the sofa, laid it under his friend's head, then summoned Mrs. Vanderbilt and George, the youngest son. Messengers were sent in haste for physicians. One from the neighbor hood responded first, and was followed almost immediately by the family doc tor, Dr. James W. McLean, Such simple restoratives as were at band had been applied, but human aid was in vain. Mr. Yanderbilt never spoke or moved after he fell under the sudden stroke, and died within a few minutes without a struggle. To all intents and purposes he was dead the instant he fell forward upon the floor. He wa? worth about $300,000,000 at the time of his death The cow of Mr. Norton, of Hudson, Mich., gorged herself with oats and was dying, when Norton cat a hole in her side, took out two bushels of oats and saved her life.

NORTHWESTERN STANDARD! SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1889. PARNELL INTERVIEWED. tc He Believes that the .Nationalists Will Have 85 and Possibly 86 Members ....... in the Next Parliament. An Expressed Belief that Liberal Coalition 'With the Government is an.' Impossibility. Correspondent—What do you think will happen in parliament? Mr. Parnell—It is very difficult to pre dict whether or not the Liberals will have a majority over the Tories and Nationalists, but neither t-b/fc Yi'iberals 'li the Nationalists ?a majority of ten, |ik the new parlia $ A i- course is until we declarations by English leaders on the Irish question That will be the question unless foreign complications arise. Correspondent—What about the Lib eral coalition wil|h the government? Mr. Parnell—I don't believe in its possibility. I see no converging lines between any large sections of the two English parties. Even if possible such a combination could not last long 1 doubt whether the Tories could de tach even twelve frdm the Liberals for the purpose of a coalition ministry, and the dozen so detached would be a poor substitute for our eighty-six yotes. Correspondent—Which party do you think will settle the question? Mr. Parnell—I expect the settlement will come from the Liberals, for, assum ing that they would be about equal to the Tories and Nationalists combined we could give them a majority of 170, which would be quite sufficient to en able them to deal with the Irish and every other question, even making al lowance for possible defection from their ranks, whereas the Tories cannot, even with our aid, get more than a bare majority, and would be hampered in the whole business by their eighteen or nineteen followers from Ireland. THE CHICAGO 00JJVEHTI0N. Preparations For The Reception of Mr. Parnell And His Associates. The committee to arrange for the re ception of Mr. Parnell and associates on Jan. 20, 1886, met last Wednesday evening at McCoy's hotel, Chicago The reception committee as made up includes the governor of the state, two senators, the mayor of the city, the judges of the federal and county courts, the Catholic. Archbishop, vi car-general, and clergymen, several Protestant minnisters, some aldermen, the justices of the peace, county and city officials, editora of the daily news papers,presidents of the Irish societies, officers of the militia, and many promi nent citizens. Thifc committee will go out on a special train to meet Mr. Parnell. An honest Englishman named Charles George Walpole, M. A., in his "Short History of the Kingdom of Ireland," has the following to say in reference to the Irish Parliament abolished in 1800: "It was the Parliament of the Fnglish colony in Ireland. It was never in any sense representative of the Nation. It was the corrupt embodiment of a dom inant race. It sold the birthright of the Nation for its own selfish ends. There had not even been a dissolution to test the opinion df the constituencies, the proposal to consult the people upon a question so vital to their interests having been condemned by Pitt as rank Jacobinism. The most remarkable and creditable thing about the whole transaction was that so many as 100 members of the Iower Moose were found whose integrity the Government was unable to corrupt, and whose hon or it was powerless to purchase." SENTM0ED—RELEASED. Edward Kelly the Irish' membered. Cable dispatches from Dublin of last Saturday report an interview with Mr. Parnell, in which he said: Out of the eighty-nine seats we hoped to carry, we have failed in only three. They were doubtful places. Now only one doubt ful seat remains. If we carry it we shall have seventeen seats in Ulster, or a clear majority of the Northern seats,* ^ju^e young came with his parents to sixty-eight in the rest of Ireland and one in England, which makes eighty six altogether. If we fail iu South Ty rone, we shall have sixteen in Ulster, leaving seventeen to the Tories. The totals will be either eighty-six Nation alists and eighteen Tories or eighty-five Nationalists and nineteen Tories. This bears out exactly my account last month, except that I thought the Whigs might carry four, or most probably two, seats, wherea® now the party has none at all. It will be seen that the anti-Irish minority is confined almost entirely to a small corner of Ulster, where the Scotch adventurers were originally planted. Correspondent—You must have been severely taxed for funds in the late con tests. Mr. Parnell—Yes. The English allies of the Irish landlords supplied £16,000 to start bogus candidates, in the hope of exhausting our treasury, but this hope was defeated by the opportune ar rival of money from various parts of America. We did, however, spend £1-5,000 and this certainly was a heavy drain. The necessity, therefore, for continued subscriptions is more press than ever, especially as more than half of the new party will need financial aid to maintain their constant attendance in parliament but contests forced upon us have served as an extraordinary demonstration of the weakness of the so-called Loyalists everywhere outside of Ulster. Those results can be handled with enormous effect by the English leader, who may propose a constitution for'Ireland. Patriot, Re­ in the course of his speech at Carll's Opera House, a short time since, John Boyle O'Reilly mentioned the fact that he had been asked to speak at the grave of Edward Kelly. "Who is Edward Kelly?" the speaker asked. And then he told of the sad fate of the noble,sim ple-hearted boy. To-day Internal Revenue Collector Troup, who sat on the stage from which Mr. O'Reilly spoke, said: "It's a most singular coincidence that Mi. O'Reilly should introduce Kelly's name as he did for all the men whom I have known as workers for the cause of Ireland I can safely say I knew Kelly the best. He was born in Kinsale, Ireland, and when Halifax, Nova Scotia. Young Kelly and I went to the Royal Acadian school there from 1849 to about 1855 graduating together and in the same year going to Boston together. We both entered the. same printing office, set type together and became members of Typographical Union, No. 13, of Boston. 'About 1863, Kelly,who was possessed of an intense love for Ireland, began to organize and drill Fenian circles in Bos ton. He was a great student, and es pecially delighted in military studies. He in time became very proficient as a drill-master, and while few not directly interested knew what was going on, it was a fact that for about two years Kelly had been hard at work drilling young Irishmen whom he expected to take with him to Ireland to take part in the uprising of the downtrodden of that nation. "Well, 1866 Kelly went to Ireland and actually led the revolt in Kerry. Every one knows how unfortunate things turned out. Kelly was captured and sentenced to be 'hanged, drawn and quartered,' but was finally let off with a sentence of imprisonment forlife,and with John Boyle O'Reilly and 60 more was hurried off to Australia. Subse quently, Kelly was released, broken down in health and completely used up. He returned to Boston, and for a long time worked as proof-reader,but was too far gone to last long, and finally death a "That's the sad story ft Edward Kelly briefly told, and I repeat that it struck me as singular, to say the least, that Mr. O'Reilly should refer to it in the presence of one who knew so much of the early history^ of the young martyr. Of cguxse, Mr. O'Reilly kwimi'^Wat I ever went to school with K§lly. I had almost forgotten about it myself, until Mr. O'Reilly's remarks sent my thoughts back to 30 years ago."—New Haven Union. Mrs. Bent, j. Vice-President Hendricks leaves widow who has almost as many per sonal acquaintances as he had. Their married life was one of unbroken hap piness, and they were as near in separable as husband and wife can be. He was anxious that she should not leave him a moment during the last hours of bis illness, and it must be a cause of regret to her as long as she lives that she happened to be absent from his bedside at the moment he ex pired. Mrs. Hendricks was the con stant companion of her husband in nearly all of his laborious political campaigns. She lived at Washington daring his service there as United States senator in the time of the war, and became widely and most favorably known in the society of the National Capital. She reappeared there last spring at the White House rebeption9, when Mr. Cleveland had become the occupant of the Presidential chair, and re-established many old-time friend ships. In the hotly contested National campaign that preceded the election of 1884 she traveled with Mr. Hendricks all over Ohio, Indiana, and other States where he spoke. She came with him to New York on his first visit here after the election, and when he was being congratulated on every hand by his en thusiastic admirers. They took rooms at the Mfth Avenue Hotel, and it was my pleasure to make them a visit an hour or two after they arrived. She sat over in one corner of the room, talking to a prominent politician of this city. I had never seen Mr. Hendricks nor his wife before, and I was struck with the beautiful companionship between them. It was not a case of husband and wife simply, but of good friends who found constant enjoyment in each other's so ciety, and who could show thev thought more of each other than any body in the world without making it offensive. She is a lady of small stature, has a round face and wears glasses- She has the politics of the country at her fin gers' end, and talks with a directness and incisiveness that at once show her to have a very alert mind. Mr. Hen dricks was sixty-six, but Mrs. Hen dricks looks to be twenty years young er. The loss of her hnsband is a ter rible blow. All her wifely sympathy was aroused in the struggle of 1876, when she believed, like nine-tenths of the other people of the United States, that Mr. Hendricks was defrauded most outrageously out of the office to which he had been elected, and she, more than he, perhaps, was ambitious that he should be vindicated by an elec tion to the Presidency. That never came, but he was elected Yice-Presi deat, and was inaugurated, yet the hand of fate fell upon him before he was allowed to exercise the functions of bis office. In a few weeks he would be presiding over the Senate. The honor and peculiar satisfaction of do ing so were snatched away just as he stood on the threshold waiting for the do»r to be opened. Another door has opened, and he who stood and waited for his reward on earth has passed in forever to a reward in a higher sphere. «w A Glorious Irish Victory—The Leader Carries 85 "y'lffyp- THE
