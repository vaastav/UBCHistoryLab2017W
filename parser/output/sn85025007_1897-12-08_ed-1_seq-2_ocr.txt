WEDNESDAY EVENING, DEC. 8, 18&7. "Retrenchment" is now the cry in the legislature; bat it is feared that it is aa much of a humbug as that of "re? form" elaewbere. How men really in? tent upon retrenchment could remove the superintendent of the peniteoMary, ?whose economical administration of bis office added fifty thousand dollars year? ly to the State's income, is hard to under? stand, especially as the reason assigced for his removal was that some of the convicts complained of their treatment. Criminals are not sent to prison to be fed with partridges and toast and to have nothing to do but to lie down aDd read novels; but it would seem that a majority of the legislators think so. Then, too, strenuous opposition i.s made to the abolition or consolidation of sinecure offices, and a bill has al? ready been introduced and will, it is slated, be parsed, to create a bureau of labor with a superintendent aDd a corps of subordinates. The only pi o ple to be benefited by such a bureau would be those who would draw its salaries. That the interest of labor 01 of laborers would not be promoted bu* been demonstrated not only by sucb bureaus in other States, but by the na? tional bureau of labor. If the farmers have derived any practical advantage? from either the national or State bu? reau of agriculture, they have not said 80. Sham retrenchment deserves as much censure as spurious reform, and as the agricultural board is to farmer.-, so would a labor bureau be to laborers. A bill has already passed the legis lature repealing the law prohibiting the shooting of partridges until they sbali become more plentiful. In this, as in most other things, the members must have been actuated by a desire to please a few of their constituents, rather t! aa to promote the general good. However, as the law was never observed by the pot hunters, or by any other law break? ers, it is probably just as well that it was repealed, as every body, except a t w in specially exempted counties, can now take a band in the extermination of the birds referred to, that will sood become a3 scarce in Virginia as deer. The present alcniuistration ha been in power nine months. In that time it has pardoned no less than twelve "highly respected" bank wreckers, men who availed theinselve? of their positions as presidents or cashiers of banks to rob the people whose money was deposited or invest ed therein. But as tiie banks sub? scribed liberally to the fund with which the election of the administration was purchased a year ago, it naturally has a kindly feeling for them; but if any people in the world deserve punish meat for their crimes, those most de? serving are the hank wreckers. It 13 now announced that Senator Lindsay, of Kentucky, who bolted his party's convention and did all he could to defeat the ticket it nominated, now eays he will go into the democratic Senatorial caucus. To fair minded people it seems there must be some doubt about this. Deserters, when pardoned, are not allowed to take pait in the councils of the army, and what is good for an army, is good for a party. Mr. Lindsay's readmission into tie democratic caucus should depend, not on his volition, but on the forbearance of the members of that caucus. General Boynton, one of the most gallant and respected survivors of the Union army, now lends his assistance to those who are in favor of pension re form. He says more money is spent annually in pensions than is received from customs during the same period, and that while nobody opposes worthy pensioners, the names of those who are unworthy should be stricken from the list. It will certainly bo a difficult matter to atop the deficit when all the reoeipts from customs are expended in pensions alone. 

THAT orders and obedience to them j are entirely different things, is proved J by the President's recent order forbid? ding removals without a hearing, and Collector Brady's summary removal of I all or nearly all his subordinates, with certainly the apparent approval of the Treasury Department. No wonder even the President's partisans on the floor of Congress oppose and denounce the gross, transparent, and grotesque humbng that travesties under the name of civil service law. Mr. Taylor, ex-mio?teT to Spain, who! protested against the rule of negroes and scalawags in the. South, is I very wroth with the President for op posing such rule in Cuba, and says tuch opposition is the result of a conspiracy i and that there "are limits even to the patience of the American people." Mr. Cleveland made many improper ap? pointments, but none worse than that of Mr. Taylor. The Emperor of Germany, the "war ! lord" of that country, as he calls him? self, is having his own way in the West Indies as in China, and neither British | advice nor American bluster has the j eligbteet effect upon his predetermined j course, and both the Chinese and the | Haitians came down before his gun as the coon did before that of Captain Scott._ 

FRUM WASHlMxTOK. [Correspondence of the Alexandria G&zottc.) Washington. Dec. 8. Senator Daniel has determined to go to Richmond and thank the legisla? ture on the occasion of his re-election. Bring asked if he was proud, he raid he had good reason to be, but had deemed it best to put straps on his head to keep the swelling down. Ex Congressman Boweo, of Virginia, an applicant for the marshalship of the western district of his Stau;, is here to day. As Senator Hanoa has arrived it sas supposed that a meeting of the ex? ecutive committee of the Virginia re? publicans would have been held yes ttrday, but Congressman Walker, of that committee said he had not been notified of any such meeting. Senator McLaurin, of South Caro? lina, is confined to his bed with an at, uck of typhoid fever. News has reached here of the fru tration of an attempt to convey a store of mumiionsof war to the Cuban insurgents just at the niomeot when it had apparently succeeded. About the middle of Sep? tember a steamer painted black ap pearert near Cienfuegos and landed a stock of ammunition and twenty men under the lead of Joseph Cepero, a naturafz-d American citizen, who, after having been he'd in a Cuban jail for nea'ly a year was released by the Spanish govemccnt last July. The expedition got inland, but nearly a I month later the Spanish authorities di*coverei nearly 500 boxes of ammu? nition for Remington and Munsur rifles concealed in r. shallow creek and carried it into town. Liter on Cepero led an attack upon a small town and ' killed several of the inhabitants, in? cluding a womau. S-nator i'ntchard to-day introduced a bill reducing the tax on distilled spir i s in bond to 70 cents per gallon. Congressman Grosvenor, republican, of Ohio, will, at the first favorable op? portunity, introduce a resolution call? ing for the correspondence between be tween Secretary Gage and Colonel Brady, collector of internal revenue for the lower district of Virginia, in refer? ence to the latter's removal of bis sub? ordinates, in violation of the civil ser? vice law and rules. Mr. Grosvenor says the only real supporter of the law and rules referred to in the Cabinet is Secretary Long, who is spoken of by hi- party as a mugwump. All the members of the executive committee of the republican party of Virginia, except Judge Waddil!, were here yesterday and were to have held a meeting, but did not, on account of the Utter's absence. But they did not in? vite General Walker, who is a member of that committee to mee: them. The committee is tne representative of the "organization" in the State, and the two republican Congressmen. Messrs. Walker and Yost, represent the disor? ganization, which people from that S a e say is by far the more numerous. Among the strangers here to day is ex-Senator Ransom of North Carolina. Tbo General says that with some more negro postmasters in nistiiate and some more speeeht-s like that Seeator Butler recently made, in which he accused the white democrats there of inciting the negroes to outrage white women, the democrats won't have much trouble in regaining control of the State at the next election. The colleagues of Representative McMillan, of Tennessee, suy that if an extra session of the legislature of that State be cailed, be will probably be elected to the Senate. Seoa'or Jones uf Nevada, an expert ou gold mining, says he is convinced that the Klocdike fields will produce more gold than those of California, Australia end Africa combined. It is rumored at tbo Capitol to-day that a strong effort will be made at this session of Congress to remove the naval academy from Auuapolis to a more Northern site. It is said to day that had a vote been taken in the House yesterday the re? publicans would nave b^eu "split wide open" on the currency question, and that they are practically so now is generally believed, and nothing that has yet been suggested can bring them together again on that question. The democrats in the Hons?, on the con? trary, seem to have a single thought on all questioas. Tue American Forestry Association held its sixteenth annuil meeting here to-day. The House banking and currency committee met to day and discussed the time for taking up tbe bill provid? ing for bank circulation up to the par value of bonds deposited, reduction of the tax ou circulation to ono fourth of one per cent and the establishment of small banks iu rural communities, but determined nothing. A piper was circulated in the Hou-e of Representatives to-day with a view to bringing about a conference of those members favoring a cbaDge in the pres? ent civil service system. The paper was handled by Representative Pear -on, of North Carolina, and received numerous signatures. The purpose.it is understood, is to make the conference non-political in character, and to ex? tend it outside of the membership of the civil service committee, as some of the men most active in urging a revision of tbo law are not on this committee. Gen. Grosvenor, of Ouio. is among these. He approved the plan of a conference of t hose interested in the subject and it is likely to be held at an early day. Congressman Rixty of the Alexandria dis. tricl his -.eceivod a request for Congressional pub?cat on-; from the Alexandria Library, a ad will comply with it as soon a* practicable! Elections committee No. 3 of tho House, of which (4;mo'al Walker is chairman, mot this morning and fixed the time for tak Dg up tho saveii cases that have been referred to them, three of which aro from Virginia. They agreed to tako up the Virginia cases last, and thiit Mr. Swausou's caso should bo tho last of thorn. C ?ngressman Lamb of Richmond is already at work trying to get the bill for the locomo tivo woiks at Richmond reported as soon as possible. It is understood, however, that the friends of the omnibus bill providing for tho payment of all the claims adjudicated by the Court of Claims will domau-i the passage of that bill, aud oppose tho passage of anv par ticular one. Seuator ?allinger to-day introduced a bill to regulato tbe civil service It provides that neither civil service laws nor the regulations under t-om "?hall be coustruid to apply to appointments to any offi e except to the cleri ??Jrfffi?in lh0 departments as dasnfied by section 163 of the Wed sta ?2o???? ? dTCal ?PP"intmcnts in tho tistomsand postal service in such customs houses and postomces as shall cmplo* 50 o! tXwk ?htd 10 :^.!et^ earners and poj a clerks of the postoffice department."

The Georgia anti-football bill, which has beep the cause of so much appre? hension in intercollegiate circles for the last moDth, was yesterday formally ve? toed by Governor Atkinson. Silver sold at sixty cents an ounce in the New York market yesterday for commercial bars. This is the highest price since Juiy and represents an ad? vance of nearly nine cents an ounce since September 1. A workman who was hanging tapes? try in the home of Mrs. Herman Oel richs, in New York, yesterday, acci? dentally dropped a tack, which fell point fir^L inro the lady's eye, and it is feared the sight will be destroyed.

Iu Baltimore riurine the week the prices of the three series o-" bonds of the Ya?kii) Volley radroad have advanced from 10 to 13 per cent. One reason as sgaed is that the courts will approve the decision ordering the sale of the road in its entirety. The banking and currency commit? tee of the House of Representatives will report a bill embodying the Presi? dent's recommendations in regard to greenback redemption. It is generally believed tbat no currency legislation will be enacted at this session of Con? gress. The Chinese government has granted the demands of Germany, which in? clude the payment of $781,350 indem? nity and the temporary cession of Kiao Chou bay and adjoining territory. The Chinese government declares that the murder of the Rhenish missionaries is being used by the German government to seise a no.val station. Adolph L. Leutgert, who is on trial in Chicago for wife murder, issued an appeal to the public yesterday, asking for pecuniary aid in his fight for life. He asserts his iunccence and says he does not want to beg fur money to con? duct his defense. A jury bad been se? cured in his case wheu court adjourned yesterday evening. THE LEGISLATURE. SENATE.

The penalty is both fine and imprisonment, at the dis? cretion of the court. General Wbarton introduced a bill which provides that every fire insur? ance company doing business in Virginia shall, before paying its yearly license, be required to make affidavit that it btlongs to no combination which was formed for the purpose of controlling rates. The bill is supposed to be aimed at the Southeastern Traffic Association, which controls the fire rates in a large section. The Senate bill designed to give full? er protection to the purchasers of lands on which taxes are delinquent, was amended in many particulars in the House, and referred to the committee On courts. The House passed to its engrossment the joint resolution directing the attor? ney general to procure copies of official bonds of treasurers and clerks of courts and papers, and ascertain if they con? tain inaccuracies or defects, and to take steps to protect the Commonwealth, if 6uch defects and inaccuracies exist. Mr. Quisenberry presented a bill to amend section 245S of the code. As the law now stands any person who is in? solvent, when a creditor attempts to "make his debt," the former will have a deed of trust drawn on his property, securing it in favor of all bis creditors, and often those who are not bona-fide creditors. The object of the amend? ment is to prevent this, and is in the following words : Unless at the time of such gilt, conveyance, assignment or transfer of or charge upon such estate, real or personal, there be pending in the County Court in which such estate is located some suit to obtain a judg? ment or decree for money against said grantor.

The engine did not leave the track. CRIMINAL EXPENSES. Much attention is now directed to the legislature to see what plan and how far reaching the much-talked-of reform wave will take. There is talk about the reduction cf salaries not be? ing sufficient to accomplish much good. The officials who are interested are di? recting tbe attention of tbe leading re? formers to the immense criminal ex? penses and emphasizing the importance of turning the pruning knife on tbem. The indications are that this will fur? nish tbe real source for reform and that the most tbat is accomplished this ses? sion will be along that line. An ex? amination of the Lst report of the auditor brings out Eotne very remark? able facts in connection with Virginia's criminal cxponses. The most signifi cent of these is that tiie prosperous and law-abiding sections of the valley and middle Virginia have to bear the bur? dens of many of the counties of the southwest and the back belts. There are thirty counties in the Slate whose criminal expenses exceed the whole amount of the taxes raid by them into the general treasury by $92,729.21. The whole amount of the criminal charges of the commonwealth for the vear end? ed September 30, 1896, was "$141.705 The couuty of Dickinson, for instance, received from the treasury $5,907.5S more than the whole amount of tax contributed by her people to the State for all purposes. Tie county of Fau quier, on the other hind, gave in $23, 09S 92 more than her criminal expenses amounted to, Autu-ta $32,520 50 and Rockingham $31,Sol Si in excess o' such charges. Shennndoah yielded to the State $12,299.9f more than her criminal costs, while Scott, with about the same population, exceeded her tax contributions by $12,005.15. These figures were brought out last night at the democranc caucus for tbe nomination of countj judges. This in? formation created sotaetbing of a sen? sation with the result tbat the nomina? tion of judges in the counties in which these heavy expenses occurred were held up. The judges in the counties where this condition of affairs did not exist and where there were no contests were nominated. Judge Slaughter Dies Suddenly.

New Yuj:k, Dec. S.?When the third day o: the six days'bicycle race open? ed in Madison "Square Garden just half the number of original starters were contesting the honors. The frigb ful piicu set by the leaders on Monday and yesterday had done its work well. Of the eighteen who were still straining every nerve to win it is probable that not more than twelve will finish out the race. Miller has a splendid lead with which to begin the last half of the contest. During the night Millet's wheel slipped from under him as he was about to dismount and ho fell down the incline but was not hurt. Rivierre fell in the same way without any worse result. Beacon slipped off bis wheel to the floor and lay there. Whin picked up be was fast asleep. The colored man, Gray, would have quit during the night had it not bten for his trainers, who insisted upon his keeping on his wheel. A feature of the raco was when early this morning Gray':; trainers followed their man around the track with a sttek, urging him to "get a move od."
