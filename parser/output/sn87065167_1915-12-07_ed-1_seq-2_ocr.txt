PAN-AMERICANISM n u. s only a With some show of impatience, Now it seems to be the neighbors and proclaims the doctrine of Pan-Americanism, is almost start-1 ling in its aggressiveness and candor and independence of thought. It goes j; so tar beyond anything of the kind that has come from the White House ! since his occupancy, that it sounds almost contradictory, short year ago when the President said, that there was "no need to discuss preparedness." nearest and dearest thing to his heart. Our forefathers drew a document, which lias served this young Republic well, admonishing "friendly relations with all countries, entagling alliances : with none." If this government ,m,let-lakes to protect all the provinces of . Houil. and Central America against the world, are we not entagling ourselves with alliances, the nature of which lias involved Europe in its present orgy of bloodshed? To invite a citizen soldiery or 400,000 men, lo enlist for sis years and pledge part of their time to the service of their country, nolens volens, is an old world doctrine and heads toward militarism; in direct opposition to the world-wide peace propaganda of the earlier days of the present Admin istration. This is the longest and strongest document the President has yet sent to the Congress, and will meet with the most bitter opposition. It will he an administration measure, and yet, as the President has asked, may not become a party measure. Democrats are certain to divide upon it, and Republicans most likely will do the same i , It will put to the test the President's in It will be discussed all winter; in congress, in Pan-Amer Jim no man, or at least few men, will doubt his patriotism or fiuence over the Congress, the press, in offices, on the streets. .Niany Wilson men will not agree with the President on his ican doctrine, question his motives. .

Is it going to happen? What a fool thing to i ! The stores are brimming with holiday gifts. Stocks are completed and selections are unlimited. As yet there is comparatively no crowding.

He ad ded that it remained to be seen whether Mexico had been ben- efited by the course taken by the administration, but that "we have at least proved that we will not take advantage of j he** in her distress and under- take to impose upon her an or- der and government of our 1 own choosing."

The Navy Plan. The President presented the War the army as "the essential first step Department plans for strengthening ,aad "for the present sufficient.' The i pians include the increasing of the standing army to a force of 141,843 men of all services, and the establish ment of a supplementary force of 400, 000 disciplined citizens, who would un dergo training for short periods throughout three years of a six years' enlistment. "It would depend upon the patriotic feeling of the younger men of the country whether they responded to such a call to service or not," said the President. "It would depend upon the patriotic spirit of the employers of the country whether they made it possible lor the younger men in their employ to respond under favorable conditions or not.

The Merchant Marine. The President told Congress that proposals would be made during the coming session for the purchase or construction of ships to be owned and directed by the government, measure, he said, would he similar to that submitted to the last Congress, but modifiied in some essential ticulars. In outlining the financial condition of the government, the President fol-; lowed closely the statement recently : given out by Secretary McAdoo. He said that the additional revenue re quired to carry out the program ot i military and naval preparation would ' be $93,800,000 for the fiscal year 1917; that if the present taxes wore continued throughout this year and the next there would he a balance in the treasury of about $76,500,000 at the end of the present fiscal year and a deficit at the end of the next year of some $112,000,000, reckoning $62,000,000 for deficiency appropria tions. Proposing that the new bills should be paid by internal taxation, the President suggested that by lowering the present limits of income exentp tion and the figure at which the sur par The . i in tax is imposed, and by increasing step by step throughout the present gradu ation, the surtax itself, income taxes as at present apportioned would yield sums sufficient to balance the books of the treasury at the end of the fis cal year 1917 without anywhere mak ing the burden unreasonably heavy. He added that there were many ad ditional sources of revenue which just ly could be resorted to without hamp ering the industries of the country or puit.bg any too great charge upon individual expenditure, that a oiv- percent tax per gallon on gasofine and naptha would yield $19, <'09.000; a tax of 50 cents per horse power on automobiles and internal explosion engines, $15,000,000:; a stamp tax on hank checks, probably $18,000,000; and a tax of 50 He estimated Mper cent per ton on fabricated iron and steel, probably $10,906,009.

No federal laws exist to meet this situation, said Mr. Wilson, because' such a thing would have seemed in credible in the past.

Regarding the railroads, the Pres ident said there had been reason to fear that they could not cope much longer with the transportation prob j lem , and suggested it would be wise ! to provide for a commission of in * ftoiry to ascertain whether the laws j as at present framed and administer i e<1 were as serviceable as they might ,)e * n t,ie solution of the problem.
