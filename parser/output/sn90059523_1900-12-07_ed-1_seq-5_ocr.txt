At*-- i mm i Ills LICENSE FOR ENGLISH TRACKS NOT TO HE RE NEWED LESTER BEIFF EXONERATED Whi j' tfce letter Is Commended as an Exemplary Youth. Master Toil In Thrown Down Hard. LONDON, Dec. C—The Racing Calendar today announces that L ster Reiff. the f American jockey, has b.-c-n exone.ated of the charge of pulling Mr. Richard Croker's horse, The Scotchman 11., at Doneaster. Tod Sloan, it is added, has been informed that he need not apply for a license for next season. "After hav.ng examined witnesses. j Which included the habitual backers of 1 American jockeys,their banking accounts j and betting books, which they desired to | inspect and which were entirely placed ' tit the stewards' disposal, the stewards I further declare there is no reason to sup- ! pose Reiff tttd or recti-, unauthor- ! ised purs e s." I The following Is the text of the racing i calendar: "It hav.ng been reported to the stewards of tne jockey club that Sloan had accepted an offer of a large, present from Mr. F. Gardiner in the event of the Codoman winning the Cam bridgesnire, and that he bet en the race, they inquired into the case, Mr. Gard ner, who was not aware of the regula- | tion forbidding such presents, expressed j 5 great regret at having transgressed, and " the stewards, fully accepting his expla nation, fined him & gomir.al penalty of £25. They, inflicted a similar hue on" Mr. C. A. Mills, who acted as commissioner i'or Mr. Gardiner. "Finding both charges proved against Sloan, they again informed him that he need not apply for a license to ride. •'Tha stewards inquired into the running of Gerolstein and Scotchman 11. at Liv erpool. A number of witnesses, includ ing both keys, were examined. Th« inquiry was extended to other horses rid den by L. Reiff. The stewards decided i that no suspicion whatever attich.d to | Rlckaby, and they also completely ex.n- , crated L. Reiff from blame. "The stewards further derided that no blame attached to the owner or the j trainer of the Scotchman 11. A number • of vague rumors inquired into were prov- \ ed, to be unfounded. "The Liverpool stewards are commend ed for having referred the case." It appears that Sloan's arrangements with the Prince of Wales came about i through. P. G. Gardiner, but that; the ! friends of the prince In the key club, having a foreboding of trouble, saved him from the humiliation of engaging a disqualified jockey. The concensus of sporting opinion in London this evening is that Sloan has to thai the clique of undesirable persons whomh. allowed himself to ba identifi.d . v.-ith in England. Cudamon, it will be remembered, was the French horse upon which Sloan won an important race in France, and the an- i Imal was brought to England to run in j the Cambridgeshire. | Sloan's faith in Cudamcn's ability r:- j iulted In the formation of one rf the larg- j est pools of the season. Mr. Gardi.ier ! was only one cf many large supporters of Sloan'?, mounts. It is estimated that something like £:o.€oo went down when the Irish horse Beryl cantered home. i The Sportsman will say tomorrow: "Lester Reiff, may ba said in the fullest sense of th.-» word, to have left the court ■with a stain upon his character. There are few of us who will not be thorough ly delighted with this result, for he ha. --made himself immensely popular here by his uniformly modest and unassuming conduct and he will doubtless be a great er favorite than ever next season. "While we ate sorry to appear inclined to exult over a man who is down, we cannot help saying that the curt intima tion to Sloan gives almost as much sat isfaction as the triumphant acquittal of j Reiff. Nobody denies that Sloan is a i very fine horseman, but little else can ( be- said in his favor. H s manners are ' far from admirable and he aopears to I regard himself as the equal, if not the • superior; of his employers. He ought I never to have been adowed to ride after \ his disgraceful conduct at Ascot in 15.9." ! The decision of the jockey club was al- < most the only subject of conversation at ; the Buffet. Victoria and other sporting i resorts this Ding. The adverse de- i cision in the case of Ted Sloan me as a i total surprise to the racing world, a. it ; did'his closest followers. - So little doubt had Sloan himself of his j ability to race here next year that he let i nearly all hi* personal possessions in ; London: Mr. t'roker's friends are much pleased I at his exoneration, as well as that of ; Wishard and Lester Reiff, and the de- I cision was wired to him at Carlsbad.

I was given no intimation that charges of any sort were pending against me, or that they were under investiga tion.. - . ' . 7 "I should at least have been given a hearing, as Messrs.

"Of course it is not proper for: me to take cognizance of the matter or action regarding it until the.official notification reaches me. My statement will then be ready for the stewards. This will make no difference in my plans, however. I will leave for California, as I have al ready arranged." MASV EXPULSIONS Announced by the National Trotting Association.

Pons came here unaware that the orig inal agreement for the match had S been canceled, but was so anxious to get on - with the local wrestler that he sent an emissary to-look up Rooney and talk over the match. Pons, who speaks no English, is a powerfully built man, near ly six feet six inches in height, and weighs 290 pounds. His manager will choose training quarters today, . while Rooney will do his preparatory work at a South side athletic club. The picture of• Pons here presented shows the first position of the French in attack. The arm is extended stiff and rigid to its full length, with the fingers of the right hand moving rapidly with the movements of the arm, the purpose being to secure a neck or back hold. In the American style, made pop ular by Muldoon. the body is extended well forward from the waist up, with both arms moving loosely and easily in front to secure a hold, the whole figure suggesting shiftiness, in contrast to the rather stiff and rigid posture of the Frenchman. * SHORTSTOP BILUARDISTS. Selunitt and Preaty Won Yesterday's Games at Saw York. NEW YORK, Dec. 6.—Of all the play ers who so. far have taken part in the qualifying games in the class B series, amateur billiard championship tourna ment, Charles G. Schmitt, of Chicago, is the first to qualify for the finals. On the opening night Schmitt beat Mannes, of New York, and tonight defeated To bias, also of this city, who 5 wen from. Marines yesterday. These. three players constitute the first group and by beating the other two, Schmitt earned the right to go. into the finals. Since his advent. in New York, Schmitt has become very popular among billiardists, and his suc cess today was applauded. Score of to day's game: Charles G. Schmitt, Chicago, total, 300; average, 4 21-69; high runs, 29, 20, 15, 15. Florian Tobias. New York, total, . -17; average, 3 43-GS; high runs, S3, 19. 15, 15. Samuel G. Estabrook. of this city, was forced out of the tournament this after noon by his being defeated-by Edwin O. Presby, another New Yorker, who scored 300 "to Estabrook's 220. Frank Billeter, of Minneapolis, defeated Estabrook-on Tuesday evening so that the two de feats :r_ze Estabrook out. The game was a lengthy one, runs coming slowly. The winner, Presby, is a wide open play er, but it took him 72 minutes to score the necessary 300 points. His open table work was excellent and at times his play for position was perfect. Following is the afternoon score: E. O. Presby, of New York, total. 300; highest runs, 39, 26, 19, IS: average, 4 12-72. Samuel G. Estabrook, New York, total. 210; highest runs. 24, 14, 13, 13; average, 2 68-71. The qualifying series of "class B" games wil end tomorrow evening, and the finals will begin on Saturday-after noon. In arranging the schedules in the final games, the committee has decided to first play those contestants against each other who come from the same city, the object of this arrangement of games being to avoid the possibility of the charge of favortism between players from the same city, in case the lovers of the game might possibly benet the chances of another contestant. While it is impossible at the present time to make any definite schedule relating to the games that may be played on Saturday afternoon and evening it seems quite probable that the Saturday-evening game will be between Messrs. Kellogg and Schmitt, of Chicago and that the two Boston repersentatives will mett in the afternoon. SrORTIXG

The senate committee on .commerce held its first meeting of the session to aay he meeting was devoted mainly to the consideration of the ship sub- S I hUL and to the amendments suggest f_\,? I™lll Vr?e- The most impor tant of these amendments was one pro viding that all ships shall fake. 50 per cent of their cargo capacity when - leav ing a port- of the United*. States for a roreign .port. - in presenting this modifi cation of the bill, Mr. F? ye safd that the enect of its incorporation' in the bill would be to increase the amount of cargo -which- must be taken, but that it would so distribute it among the varans ships that there would be no inequality or in justice. - The amendment requiring vessels clear ing for foreign ports to carry cargo amounting to 50 per.cent of their carry ing capacity was adopted by the -"com mittee. It now reads as follows: "No vessel shall.be entitled to full compensation unless she shall have cleared from a port of the United States with cargo to the amount of 50 per cent of her capacity . for carrying commercial C3.rg"o. • Another amendment relates to the division of the annual award of $9,000,000 between ships on the Atlantic ocean and those on the Pacific. As originally pro vided 70 per cent of the amount was to be expended upon the Atlantic and SO per cent on the Pacific with an addition al provision that in case the entire 30 per. cent should not be utilized on the Pacific it might be diverted to the At lan tic. There was no reciprocal pro cal provision in the interest of the Pa cific ships. That -is provided by today* action the language of the provision be. ing as follows: In case the said Atlantic ocean trade shall not require the whole amount of the said 70 per cent and the said Pacific ocean tirade shall require in respect of the vessels engaged in said Pacific ocean trade, the expenditure of more than the said SO per cent of said $9,000,000 any such year, there may be expended, pursuant to the provisions of this act any sum within the said $9,090, --000 remaining and not earned, as - afore said, in respect of the vessels in the At lantic ocean." The section relating to the granting of American registry to foreign-built ships was amended so as to further guard against fraud by showing from records, already on file in the treasury depart ment exactly what vessels of that description are to be admitted to Ameri can registry under the bill and thus avoid all dispute as to- the total volume of the tonnage. It is claimed that the result of the amendment is to require that a foreign-built steamship described in clause B, of section 9, should have been actually contracted for and the contracts filed with the secretary cf the treasury on or before the first day of February, ISS9, and that such contracts should have resulted in the actual construction of the vessel or in her having been under con struction in accordance with the contract or before the first day of January, 1900, in order to come within the act's pro vision. An amendment to section 10 requires that all fittings and machinery forming a part of the construction of vessels built in the United States under provisions of this act shall he of American- manu facture, provided they can be obtained in this country.

The record of the. preliminary trial was brought in to quote the testimony of Mrs. Spangler, who first said she had not seen anything in Miss Morrison's hand on the day of the tragedy and who,. dur ing the present trial testified that she had seen something resembling a knife in the prisoner's hand. It was also shown that the - Rev. Dr. Wharton, who was pastor to both Mrs. Castle and Miss Mor rison, had. :_-. in conversation, said that the only thing the defense could do would be to plead insanity for Miss Morrison.

PROSECUTION CLOSES. -.In the trial of Jessie Morrison, charged with killing Mrs. Olin Castle, who mar ried the prisoner's former sweetheart, the prosecution today closed Its case with the p testimony of Dr. Fullinwidor, on. of the physicians who attended Mrs. Castle. He repeated the testimony con cerning the manner in. which the dying statement was made. Then Prosecutor Brumback read to the jury the dying declaration, as abridged by the court. The jury followed him closely. It was then announced by * the defense that an effort will be made to prove that Mrs. Castle | called Jessie Morrison into her house and began a quarrel. Mrs. Emma Grover, who made the of ficial record of the preliminary hearing, was the first witness for the defense. She identified the record of Mrs. Emma Spangler's testimony, which was to the effect that she had seen nothing in Miss Morrison's hand at the Castle home. Mrs. Spangler testified in the present trial that I she thought. Miss Morrison held a blade of some sort.- At the afternoon session Miss Emma Weber was I asked : about a visit Miss Morrison . paid. to her about a week be fore the murder.- This testimony war to have been concerning a conversation be tween, defendant and Miss Webber about Clara Wiley, but it was objected to by the state and the objection was sustained. 

TALE OF JEALOUSY. * Mrs. Henry Pugh told of a conversa tion that had taken place between her self and Miss Wiley before the latter'a marriage to * Olin Castle, regarding a ' story that Castle bad given Miss Mor rison a mirror. Mrs. Castle declared, said the witness, "that she did not be lieve the story.. but said she would see about it and if Olin had done it she would have nothing more to do with him." "Was anything said about a letter Jes. sic Morrison had written to Olin Castle ?" "Yes, she said that Jessie wrote a let ter to Olin and that it contained a dirty black scheme and.that Jessie asked Olin to participate in it." Cross-examined, Mrs. Pugh said that Clara Wiley had never exhibited anger, in her conversation about Jessie Mor rison. Dr. H. S. Miller, asked Whether or not he had had a conversation with the Rev. Dr. Wharton in regard to a plea of in sanity for Jessie Morrison, said: "Dr. Wharton said that the only plea that Miss Morrison could.make was the plea of insanity." Dr. Wharton, on the stand yesterday. denied haying-asked any one regarding a plea of insanity." . Anna Davis and Dr. J. TV. McKenzie, who saw Miss Jessie Morrison'just be fore the .tragedy, testified that they ob served nothing unusual in her manner, and saw nothing in her hands. Mrs. Mary E. Hellers, a sister of the defendant, testified that in the summer, and fall of 1599 Miss Morrison lived with her.
