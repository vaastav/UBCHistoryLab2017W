J6s3Te prefer a Democrat to a Repub lican of equal character. ESTXo honest and true Republican asks to beretained, and none other should be retained. In the South a sweep with a eleati broom is demanded by all Demo crats BS&-'Turri the rascals out." TEE POWER TO TAX IS THE POWER TO DESTROY. The privilege to as3oss our property for its value is an implied right to take all if the emergency should seem to demand it. The Constitu tion gives Congress power to . raise by taxation moi.ey enough to defray thejiesessary expenses f the govern ment and if these expenses shall continue to increase, it will not take a prophet to predicW.be time when it, will take all the available, commead able measures of the people to defray the expenses oft the government. We are both disappointed and morti fied that our President, in his manifes to to Congress did not dwell on, and urge Congress to reduce the expenses cf the sovernuient, bv abolishing many useless offices, and reducing the salaries of many more. - But he is as dumb as an oyster and as blind as a bat on this all important subject. Instead cf coming up to the demands of the times and the pledges of the party, he has advised the increase of the salaries of many of his ftp pointces and the creation of some newolEces. - Instead of levying forty million dollars less this fiscal year than the republicans levied the last ncai year, ne ana hi3 secretaries have demanded of Congress thirty three million more. This is reduc ing expenditures and lightening the burdens of the people with a vim, and keeping the democratic pledges to a letter ! 3Ir. Manning in his re port to Congress says the war tariff ought to be reduced. We think so too. Hut our President doe en't think so if he does he did not say so. With trie same force, we think both the President and his secretaries mi" lit have said really the salaries of the government agents and olficials w ere fixed during and immediately afu-r the war, under republican rule, ami ought to be reduced. They could in truLh h.vvv said that during thsr period the increase was -from feisty mi! lions ! ;i! -out three hundred ifiiihoiis. N.nv why not cut dowu these expenses and abolish many of th-: sinecure places, as well as cut down- i he waraxes. We think thev go tog. h- rand ought to be cut. down iiiiifas or.e and at the same time. It required sixty millions of dollars to run ibis government, under Bueh an.Mn per annum, from 1857 to 18G1 making two hundred and forty mill ions for the tour j-eara. We had a popuirion then of about thirty mill ions of people, we have now abont fif";y eight millions. Now it takes ai'ont two !iii:i;!-cd and sixty million "ais. . ui-iure uie war itioqu'i- e.i under wing or demoeratic admin if":! i.i.i 1 .... . it i.-u. u.t.twu au'im iwo ooiiars ier capita to ma the government; now under republican and democratic ad- , j,. ion niiuut. seven uoiiars ptr capit.o. is -if not time th people wiio live by the sweat of the face had opened their eyes? Is it not lime they had awakened from their le( iiaigy and thrown' oil" the in cubus tht weighs them down, and is squeezing . and pressing the energy, vitality-and life out of them'. A man can now live on half of what he could ten years ago, and one fourth of what he could during the war. H is time everything had sought a level and every body put on an equal fooling in tLe rat e of life.- civil service hunibng, and what can explain the positions of the remain ing admirers we know not, unless with republicans it is to keep their friends in and, too,nnless with dem ocrats it is because they are dissafc isfied with their own success in the party and don't want to see true democrats in the front and there fore they too wish the republicans kept in office. The Cab:.et officers are exempt from the civil service examination because the people have confi dence in the President's sense and discretion to select competent men. The foreign ministers are exempt from the humbug of examinations because it is conceded that the appointing power has sense and dis cretion enough not to select either an idiot or a tyrranical demagogue. The assistant cabinet officers stand no examinations because .it is believed that the President. and the cabinet officers have sense and discretion enough to make no big mistakes. All this is right. Jefferson and Buchanan and Hendricks be lieved in this And now the civil service act ad vocate conies and plainly and ua questionably says,for actions speak louder than words, "Mr. President and Mr. Cabinet officer, you have sense enough to make an appoint ment which it takes education, brains and statesmanship to fill but you havo not got sense enough to make an appointment which netds only business qualities in the officer, therefore I sav we ought to keep an official in for life when we get a competent one. You will, it left by yourselves uurestrieted select a focJ.an incompetent man,an ignoramus, a hotheaded, reckless partisan demagogue." Thus says the L. S. reformer and our Presi dent Cleveland in his message has said and his cabinet too. "Yes Curtis & Co. you are right; We need a law to keep us from act ing fools." Shame, shame upon democracy. A Jackson is not our President, a Jefferson is not our President. What a pity! This British system of life tenure of office is the first seed of despotism and monarchy. The Blair bill is a curse upon the individuality of States and iiouiiis, mo cin service act is a curse upon the name of Repub lic, The civil Service reform that was THE 

MESSAGE. (Communicated) We have waited patiently for the President's message to Congress, hoping that he would redeem himself in the eyes of all men everywhere, by washing his hand of wu mpism and mugism, and by rising to the height and measure of a full g-own statesman. But we were doomed to sad disappointment. On all minor questions npon which he had been fully informed and posted by the reports of his Secretaries, he takes a manly, dignified position And in the outset we will say thai we must heartily approve of all her says so far as he weut on all except -the Tariff, Silver, and Civil Service re form questions. We were in hopes he would make many suggestions and point out many ways by which the government could . be administered on less money and the burdens of the people made lighter. But in his judg ment other things demanded all his time and attention such as increas ing the salaries of his three unconsti tutional civil service bed-fellows and wumpish pets and increasing- the salaries and outGts of our Ministers Consuls etc., a useless appendage to a Republican form of govern ment m these days of civilization, railroad and teleg.aphs and cabl graphs, in foreign lands. Upon the Tar.tF question, one" of the great issues of the day,, he strad dies the fence.and is making a desper ate effort to walk arm-clutched with both Sam Randall and John .G. Ca v iisle as though he possessed the mi raculous power of causing oil and water to mix. Upon the civil service qnco,ion he goes into spasms, and doesn't th?nk this grand Republic and gloriors eoun'uy of ours, the home and birth plac3 of Jefferson, Madison, Jackson Hendricks and a thousand other 3uch grand types of American man hood and Americ an democracj', could possibly stand the strain of another general election without sxmur in The author of the Federal peda gogy bill, Blair by name, is .evi dently a dissatisfied man, a com plete moralist, perhaps a crank. He is a' New Englander and talking about strange notions, he has them. What a reformer he is ! No wonder he'is in tavdr of Federal free schools. The N. Y, World has the following : '.'Senator Blair is on hand to re form things. He wants the Consti tution of the United States amend ed so" that women can vote and men can be prevented from drinking whiskey.- Mr. Blair would doubt less, like to have , the privilege of writing an entirely new Constitution for us." .

So far the writer has heard no com plaint among our people on this scoro. Watchman. We supi o e by the time this issue of the Democrat gets into the hands of its readers, the line of Presiden tial succession will have been detei mined. The secretary ' of the State coining after the Vice-President and the other members of the Cabinet following in order. This has been one flaw in the executive part of our government. We are glad that it has been remedied. We notice that Elder P. D. Gold of Zions Landmark had a political editorial- last week. Something strange, of course it is all right for all men are interested in politics. He is a Civil Serce Reformer, we are surprised to learn.

In other words he and bis mugwumps have saved the gove- nment from dis solution and chaos, and if there is no weakening along the line of wumpish ness (of which he sssures us there will be none)wiil hand it over to the next generation, thorot .hiy non- American with all the ojcuoants Some of our contemporaries are for Hill and Lee for 1888. Both David P. Hill, Governor of New Fork, and Fitzhugh Lee, Governor of Virginia, are good Democrats.

The presumption that any sach law is needed is entirely erroneous. Why? Because it is a presumption that a higher officer, that is the one who appoints, will appoint an intompe- nujjiuiuaio. xs iuis not a fatsa presumption? Jefferson,Mon roe, Jackson and the other grand light houses along the coast of American politics of the past, and the great defenders and advocates of real democracy never felt, never suspected, never imagined the need of any restrictions upon the ap pointing powers m order to secure eomp3teni subordinates. The sen timents of the President of the States ' as set forth massage are but an ejho of those of Curtis, and all over tha laud they are thinly reechoed.
