SENATOR DUBOIS RESIGNS A POSITION Hit Succcasor Chosen—Caucus Dlsoassea Dingley Bill and Other Topics— __ House Passes the Fen* jgJ slon Bill. Washington, Dec. 9.—The republican senatoriul caucus did not accomplish much Tuesday except to uncover the unpleasant fact that the free silver coU' tingent is for the present determined to flock by itself. Senator Dubois em phasized this point by resigning' from the secretaryship of the caucus and from the steering committee, and his colleagues, Senators Canuon, of Utah Mantle, of Montana, and Squire, oi Washington, stayed away. Teller not being in the city could not attend. Sen ator Peitigrew was also absent. Senator Dubois, through a note ad dressed to Senator Sherman, chairman of the caucus, resigned the secretary ship of the caucus and his membership on the steering committee. This may be an indication of the proposed policy of the free silver men to refrain from hereafter affiliating with their old-time colleagues. Dubois' Successor. Senator Wilson, of Washington, was elected secretary in place of Senator Dubois. There was a friendly rivalry between Senators Shoup, of Idaho, and Ilansbrough, of North Dakota, for the vacancy on the steering committee caused by the resignation of Senator Dubois. The question was settled sat isfactorily by putting both men on the committee, and to tliat extent increas ing its membership. The Dingley BUI. The chief topic for discussion was the Dingley bill, with the re sult that the matter was re ferred without action to the steering committee. That committee will consider the advisability of talcing up the Dingley bill and the possibility of passing it if wisdom suggests that such au effort should be made. Sena tor Sherman, who has hitherto been oneof the chief advocates for this meas ure, refrained from discussing it. The consensus of opinion gathered from the short speeches made was that it would not be wise to take up the bill, owing to the entanglements that were sure to arise, and the more potent fact that it nvould be impossible to get the votes wherewith to pass it. The republicans who attended the caucus say they are firm in the conviction that the Dingley bill is now without hope of passage. For a Monetary Conference. Senator Wolcott, of Colorado, intro duced a resolution, which was unani mously adopted, authorizing the chair man of the caucus to appoint a special committee of five senators, whose duty it bhould be to devise such legislation for action by this session of congress as will secure an international mone tary conference ^vith the leading com mercial nations of the world. Senator Gear brought up the Pacific railroad question, as did Senator Lodge the immigration bill. The Pacific road bill was referred to the steering com mittee, but after Senator Lodge had explained the status of the immigra tion bill the caucus desired to stand by that as a part}- measure and to press for its early consideration. For a Permanent Census 12ureau. Washington, Dec. 9.—Carroll D. •Wright, commissioner of labor, sent to congress his report upon a plan for a permanent census service in accordance with the joint resolution of March 19, 1896. Mr. Wright is satisfied that the true principles on which a permanent census to do the work of decennial cen suses should be barred, are all to be found in reports already made to con gress. The expense of conducting a permanent census bureau and taking a decennial census Mr. Wright estimates at an average of $800,000 a year. Town Lots Exempted. Washington, Dec. !).—ine secretary of the interior has decided that the amendment of sections 2,289 and 2,290 of the revised statutes does not author ize the homestead entry of lands in eluded within, the limits of an incorpo rated town. It is held that sound pub lie policy would not allow such acqui sition of lands so situated and thereby likely largely enhanced in value. Demand for Improvements* Washington, Dec. 9.—It is expected that a number of resolutions will be in troduced into congress inquiring of the secretary of war why contracts have not been made at various points for be ginning river and harbor work in ac cordance with the provisions of the river and harbor act and also why certain work has not been ordered where con tract's are not necessary Adjourns 011 Hearing: of Crisp's Death, Washington, Dec. 9.—When the sen lite reconvened Tuesday morning the vice president presented a communica tion from the secretary of the treasury, giving the numbers of aliens employed in the treasury department as called for by resolution May 9 last. It states that the number of such aliens at the time of adoption of resolutions was 35 but since then almost all of them had become naturalized. Various other department communications were re ceived and referred—among them the annual report of the government direc tors of the Union Pacific company. Petitions from Philadelphia and St. Louis favoring the passage of the Ding ley bill were presented by Senator Morrill (rep.) and referred to the finance com mittee. Like petitions were presented by other senators, also several memori als in relation to Armenian outrages. Senator Cuilom (rep., 111.) gave notice that he would next Thursday morning submit remarks on the Cuban ques tion. A message from the house in re-, lation to the death of ex-Speaker Crisp was laid before the senate, and on mo lion of Senator Bacon (dem„ Ga., wh» stated that he would ask the senate at a future time to assign a day for eulo gies, the senate at 12:35 adjourned. House Passes Its First Bill. Washington, Dec. 9.—In the house Tuesday Mr. Loud (rep., Col.), from the committee on post offices and post roads, called up a bill to authorize the use of private mailing cards, of the ,same weight and form as the postal .cards now in use, when a one-cent jctamp is affixed. The bill, he said, had jbeen approved by the post office depart ment, as it would tend to popularize '|POstal cards, besides effecting a saving rfe^to the government of the difference be i''itweed tl^e eoet of tip owdc atid too WiHkr-/ 'J stomps. The Bcheme had been success fully put in operation in Kngland, where in six months the number of such cards mailed had increased from 248,000,000 -to 334,000,000. The bill was passed. It takes effect July 1,1897. Mr. Loud also called up bill to pro vide a limited indemnity for the loss of registered mail matter, it provides un indemnity of not to exceed ten dollars for any one registered letter, but if of less value not to exceed the actual value. .This bill was also approved by the post office department. Such an indemnity is made by nearly all the foreign coun tries. The postmaster general expressed the opinion that the increased revenue from registered mail would more than offset the indemnity losses to be paid. Mr. Loud said that on the basis of last year's statistics the government could have a revenue of $900,000 with a liability of $50,000. There was some criticism of the bill on the ground that it tres passed on the rights of express* com panies, but it was passed by a vote of 70 to 13. Mr. Loud then called up the bill of Mr. Sperry (rep., Conn.) to authorize the collection and delivery of mail in cities, towns and villages where no let ter-carrier service exists, by the em ployment, under mutual arrangement between the citizens, of any person in such place to perform this service, at a cost not exceeding one cent for the delivery of each letter or package. The expense of delivery under the terms of the bill is to be borne by the bene ficiaries and there is no liability so fur as the government is concerned. The bill was passed. Pension Bill Passed. The general pension appropriation bill was then taken up, and Mr. Grow (rep., Pa.) made a brief speech in favor, of a protective tariff based upon the president's commendation in his mes sage of- the present tariff law. The pen sion bill was passed without amend ment. Makes a Tariff Speech. During the debate on the pension bill Mr. Grow (rep., Pa.) the venerable rep resentative and ex-speaker of the house, took occasion of the liberty accorded under the rules to make a tariff speech, lie took for his text these statements in the president's message reluting to the Wilson tariff bill: "The only entire fiscal year during which this law has been In force ended on the 80th day of June, 1S9G. .In that year our Im ports Increased over those of the previous year more than {6,500,000, while the value of the domestic products we exported and which found markets abroad was nearly $70,000,000 more than during the preceding year. "Whatever"may be its shortcomings as complete measure of tariff reform, it must be conceded that it has opened the way to a freer and greater exchange of commodities between us and other coun tries, and thus furnished a wider market tor our products and manufactures." In the two years and five months ended December 1, Mr. Grow said, the deficiency in the revenues of the gov ernment amounted to over $110,000,000, and yet the president made no recom mendation to congress regarding the in crease of revenue. He did say, however, that 110 deficit that had occurred or that was likely to occur need exeite or dusturb us. "Most placid, comfortable frame of mind," said Mr. Grow. "The president evidently thinks the creditors of the nation will not be enxious so long as the engravers and Sprinting presses of the country do not break down." Mr. Grow said he would not consider the tariff in any partisan sense, but as a simple business matter, affect ing the revenues of the treasury. If the present law was not good for any year, the first dut3r of congress was to pro vide revenues for the government, lie compared the workings of the MeKin ley and Wilson laws and sarcastically referred to the president's assertion that the latter "had opened the way to a freer and greater exchange of com modities." Protection, he contended, Ineaat employment for American labor and revenue for the treasury. The documents in the contest of Thomas E. Watson vs. J. C. C. Black for a seat in the Pifty-fourtli congress from the Tenth Georgia district, were received from the clerk of the house nnd by the speaker referred to the com mittee on elections No. 1. At 4:20 the house adjourned.

KILL HIM AGAIN. Spaniards Onoe More Announce the Death of Maoeo. SAY HE WAS SLAIN IN A RECENT FIGHT The Rebel Leader wltli Ills Troops Crosses tlie Trooha Only to Meet Bis Death—Great Joy In Havana. Washington, Dec. 9.—Senator Mills (dem., Tex.) will introduce to-day in the senate a joint resolution directing the president of the United States to take military possession of the island of Cuba and hold it until its inhabitants can institute such government as they may wish to organize and arm such forces as may be necessary to protect them against invasion. Maceo Again Reported Killed. Havana, Dec. 9.—Maj. Cirujuda, hav ing received information that a force of rebels had arrived in the vicinity of Punta Brava in the Havana province, started with his command in the direc tion the rebels were believed to be. The Spanish troops met the main body of insurgents, 2,000 strong, at Sun Pedro and engaged them in battle. The in surgents intrenched themselves behind stone fences, where .they held the po sition until nightfall, when they were dislodged and compelled to retire. The Spaniards then returned to 'Punta Brava. They lost in the fight three privates killed and three lieutenants, nnd 28 privates wounded. Over 40 of the rebels were left dead upon the field. There was found among the dead rebels the body of a well-dressed man on which there were documents which lead to the belief that the 'dead man was the son of Maximo Gomez. Among the papers found was one on which, written with a lead pencil, was the con fession that the writer had committed suicide rather than abandon the body of Antonio Maceo. The war diary of Maceo was also found. In it there is an entry which says the rebels crossed the troclia on December 4. It is concluded from these circum stances that Maceo was killed in the engagement with Maj. Cirujeda's com mand. The news of his .death has caused the greatest kind of a sensatiou in Havana. The loyalists are jubilant, believing that with the killing of Maceo a blow has been struck at the rebellion that will result in its speedy suppres sion. Think It Is a Trick. Though the Spaniards are confident that Maceo is really dead this time, some of the Cubans profess to believe that the finding of the confession and the diary was due to a trick of the in surgents to delude"the Spanish into the belief that Maceo was killed, while he pursues his plan of reaching Gomez. The important news reached Havana Monday night, but the censor would not permit of its being cabled until Tuesday evening. Do Not Explain It. The government officials vouchsafe no information as to how Maceo, with an overwhelmingly superior force oper ating against him and supposed to be watching his movements, could have eluded the Spanish forces, doubled oi) them, crossed the trocha at what has been supposed the strongest part of it and reached the province of Havana without any known interference until he reached a point comparatively close to Havana. Hero of the Hour. Maj. Cirujeda is now in the city and it has been proposed to hold a great demonstration in his honor. In the cafes and all other public places the Spanish residents are congratulating each other on what they believe to be a death blow to the rebellion, and it is predicted that Capt. Gen. Weyier will now have an easy task of defeating the insurgents under Gomez and the minor leaders. 1'or nearly two jcars there has not been such joy in TTnvana as there is now, and the speedy establishment of peace is confidently looked for. It is thought thut when Gomez learns of the death of his chief lieutenant he will be dis posed to treat with Gen. Weyier for a cessation of hostilities. There is some ground, nevertheless, for the supposi tion that the report is not true. The officials here declare that while they believe that both Maceo and Gomez's sou are dead, they lack positive informa tion and are awaiting a confirmation of the report. This, however, has had no effect upon the popular jubilation, and Maj. Cirujeda is the hero of the hour. "So Comment on the Message. No comments have been published by the local press on President Cleveland's message to congress, and no news has been received as to its effect in Spain The silence of the press here is attrib uted to government intervention, it not being desired to excite popular feel ing against the United States.
