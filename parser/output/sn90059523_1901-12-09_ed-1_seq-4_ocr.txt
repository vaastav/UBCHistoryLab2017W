It is announced in an Associated i ress dispatch dated Denver that President Roosevelt has issued an order directing tfederal officeholders to withdraw from all positions which they occupy in po litical organizations at the risk, on re fusal, ot having their several offices declared vacant. Such an order as this, strictly enforced, is a national necessity. There probably 2^ mi 1,1 Iv found in the entire country today a Republican official of the federal government possessing- influence in »..s locality who does not feel himself at lib erty 10 take part more or less actively, in the political movements in his vicinity on behalf of the administration of -arnica he is a part. From time to time, no mat ter li>w insistent the successive presi dents may have been in the profession <if attachment to civil service, changes have iu'eii wrought in the civil service •regulations, especially around election times, designed to help the adn.i.iistra tion. These practices culminated in 1592 in "the entire force of federal officials in the South being marshaled for the re nomination and re-election of the then president, Gen. Harrison. Civil service has been a fraud in opera tion in its bearing on the conduct of na tionai officials in election contests. Wun dn a few days a former speaker of the Minnesota house of representatives, Mr. Dowling, was quoted in the public press -as intimating that he would nave the support of many, if not all, of the post masters of his district in his candidacy for a congressional nomination. It is true that a sense of personal and official propriety restrains many federal officials from the more offensive expres sions of their political partisanship; but, in this state at least, the order directed SSHJnst "pernicious activity" is practical ly unknown. President Roosevelt has a reputation to sustain as a civil service reformer. His course thus far shows that while he may not suffer open and notorious viola tions of the civil service law, he is not likely to do aught in that or any other direction which may tend to seriously interfere with his prospects of securing his party's nomination for president. The least that is expected of him, how ever, is that he shall put rigidly in force the regulation which protects the disin terested citizen from seeing the political machinery controlled by those who are officially' and pecuniarily interested in maintaining- the existing administration in power. 

WELL-31E11ITBD THA NKS. At its last 'meeting of the year the members of the city consolidation com mittee of the St. Paul Commercial club took pains to bestow a special vote of thanks on Mr. John Caulfield, its chair man, for the zeal and activity he had shown, in the discharge of the work of the committee: From a body composed of many of the ablest; most public spirited and zealous citizens of St. Paul such a courtesy might well he regarded as an honor by any man. To have deserved it, he must sure ly have shown exceptional qualities. The consolidation committee has been active in many ways since its organiza tion for the city's betterment. It has done excellent work, and its members have not saved either time or labor in promoting the several laudable purposes in connection with the city's welfare to which they have addressed themselves. The honor thus bestowed on Mr. Caul field was well-merited. He is almost uni versally recognized among our people as a painstaking tmd conscientious man, filled to the very brim of his nature with personal energy, and ready to ex ercise his facilities in every direction for the general godS. He is unpreten tious and retiring in his disposition. Men of hia stamp usually go their way without any special thought being be stowed upon their superior devotion by those around them. Their very, superiority is regarded as entirely a matter of course. . a city official Mr. CaiUiii-kl is almost ideal. No public department could he better administered than our water de partment. Its secretary's connection with it runs back to the time when he was a stripling. He has grown up with the service, aucl il3 efficiency is in great est measure due to his exhaustive knowl edge of its details and to his excellence as an administrative officer. The Globe cordially unites in avow ing the general sense which prevails of the splendid services to the city of his birth rendered by Mr. Caulfield both as a man and a public official. It is said that the pope is not disposed to take any notice of the coronation of the English king. Probably not. When a man has turned eighty he may have much more serious matters to devote his attention to, even if he be no pope at all. nil.h 3IAKI: JW> IHFFEREXCE. It is announced, evidently on the in- spiration of the navy department clique, that the court of inquiry will decide that Admiral Schley should be censured for his conduct in many directions during the Santiago campaign. He will be .--en sured, we are assured, for his prolonged stay at Cienfuege-s; for his acting in violation of orders in making his so called retrograde movement toward Key- West; for his failure to sink the Colon; for prevarication in the statement of his reasons for making the retrograde move ment, and for other delinquencies. There is nothing impossible in this world; and, therefore, it is even possible that the court will hold Sehley to be a coward and caitiff, as the departmental prodigy. Maclay, designated him. But it will not matter very much either as to the ultimate result on the popular conception of Schley, or as to his place in history. ([,■ Is the true hero of the great engagement, end his fame will live in American naval history as equal to that of the grandest name in the galaxy of heroism which that history reveals. If the court of inquiry wishes to com mit itself to the approval of the state ments of a clique of disappointed and baffled marplots, there is no power on earth can hinder it from doing so. But, for the good name of Admiral Dewey and his associates, it is to be hoped that there will be no further aspersion cast upon the good name of American sailors than has already been wrought through the attempted defamation and ruin o£ Schley. 'When the end has been reached there will be little doubt loft how the nation esteems the services of the Maryland sailor. Indeed there will be, if possible, even less doubt should the court of in quiry present the vemarkable report which the administration toadies of the department seem to have outlined for that body. The imperialist brethren are only oe ginnihg to have the significance of- that diamond rings decision dawn upon them. Among the other results of it is the one that Philippine shipping is coast snip ping, and that foreign bottoms cannot engage In it. This is another sad blow to the imperialist programme of ship subsidies. 

THAT IIIILU'I'IXE TAUHT. That very adroit document, the presi dent's message, did not take account of Mr. Justice Brown. Nor did its author. But Mr. Justics Brown is none the less a mighty man—a sort of suyrerne court of ihe United States all to himself, whos^ dicta in the insular cases has been more potent than that of any of the despot 3 of old in producing results fraught with tremendous significance to those affected by them. Had President Roosevelt reckoned with Mr. Justice Brown he would have said something on the great overpowering subject of tariff legislation besides his harmless words on reciprocity. But he did not, and It is not ill for him that he did not. It would have evidently been quite embarrassing to that prudent poli tician if he were compelled to touch on the subject; and touch upon it he would be compelled to do had he had official cog nizance of that decision before his mes sage was promulgated. What a convenient and altogether ad mirable arrangement It would have been for the Republican majority in congress had it been able to let the subject of tar iff legislation rest on the puny efforts of Babcock to arouse party interest in the subject. The reciprocity treaties might, THE ST. 

PAUL GLOBE, MOSUAY, DECEMBER 9, 1901. indeed, be brought up at any time and in definitely shelved, as so many hundreds of proposed treaties have been shelve! since the federal senate first convened; and the position of the Republican na tional administration would not neces sarily have been disturbed in the slight est. Now, however, we must, of coursa, render the Philippines capable of produc ing revenue for their/ own consumption. We have been pouring money down that national rat-hole so long that it is about time we made at least an effort to ge>t some out erf it. Hence the avowed neces sity of a tariff law for the Philippines, and an enabling act which will operate as a sort of constructive notice to that dangerous instrument, the constitution, to keep away from the vicinity of the national flag in the Philippines. Altogether Democrats have many rea sons for taking off their hats to Mr. Jus tice Brown. The St. Paul Globe per forms the ceremony with the most pro found sense of the august position which that gentleman occupies in the internal economy of this nation. They are few, indeed, who will not sympathize with Commissioner CTaussen in the indignation he expresses -t the somewhat vague report of irregularities among his force. No one thinks of im puting anything wrorfg, or the counte nancing of anything wrong, on his part individually. But is if not better for Mr. Claussen to wait until the public ex aminer has said all he has to say con cerning his examination? Mr. Claussen, as well as the general public, will then be in a better position to pass judgment on the siruation. Tt requires some considerable nerve to live and die the son of a very rich man without making a fool of one's self. The career of the dead Pullman, and of the live Strong and thousands like him, show that men who ought to know better have not even the mosl primitive understand ing of the parental obligation. Perhaps it is because they want to be out of the way when the explosion comes that so many rich men die before they ;.ostow on their progeny such splendid facilities for revealing the devil in their natures. Certain -, London :: papers ;; are . unkind enough to comment on : the sacrifice of j a thousand 5 larks' to make lark pie for the j Prince of Wales, at the same time point ing out that the prince is chairman of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Birds. : Strange that any . London pa per should so completely miss the > -Ant. : What higher form ■of J Kindness ; could be bestowed on the ; larks than is involved in the ; honor of being eaten by a pros pect iv'S king-? "X : :; .^* i.-;:--"?' There is talk of bringing Joseph H. Choate back from England and sending John Hay to take his place. The ar rangement is an admirable one both from the American and British point of view. Hay has been a success abroad and a failure at home. Choate has been a fail ure abroad and a success at home. In addition to all this Hay wears his whisk ers in a way to suit the British; Choate has no whiskers to wear. They are thinking in England of pass ing a law which will enable women to be imprisoned who leave their young chil dren alone with fire, thereby endangering their lives. Why not try the experiment of saving the poor women the necessity of leaving their children alone with or without fire? Some such measure would be quite as likely to lessen the prevr.aing heavy infant mortality in England. Carbolic acid has been found very ef fective by the Marseilles port authorities in destroying rats,and they believe that it may prevent the plague infections which, have so often been brought by rats. It probably will. It has been effective for very many years in removing quite a quantity of suicidal carrion. *J Remarks ■ : '■- '-l .'- *< —.^- * '-• .-»'J'-'V *■■' ■C£?<^T 'Tis worse to have fought and won Than never to have fought at all. At least Sampson received over $25,000 for the latter, and Schley was awarded the munificent sum of $150 for doing the former. Ten thousand Ulinoisans have petition ed congress to disfranchise and render ineligible to public office all polygamists. No doubt these good people have made it plain that they mean the simultaneous sort of such as is practiced in Utah, not the successive Chicago divorce kind. Did, or did not, President Roosevelt know how many Republican postomce officials he smote under the fifth rib when he issued that order that all federal of ficeholders must resign from membership in political organizations? This hits the Third district hard and Congressman Heatwole will doubtless face a painful duty and crush that interfering presi dent. Chicago is to have a telephone millen ium, nothing for incoming calls, live cents for outgoing calls, metallic circuit, no party lines, private telephones not to cost over $50, and business telephones not over $85 a year. Sioux City is the home of some very economical insane asylum supervisors. According to public report these thrifty officials are in the habit of taking pa tients from time to time across the state line and then proceed carefully and sys tematically to "lose" them. Such a sys tem is useful -in that it serves a double purpose; first, it is economical, and sec ond, it permits a sister state to exercise that Christian charity which is so good for the soul, and take up the burden of the patient's support. It should be Stat ed, however, that the economical part is slightly offset by the determined persis tency with which some of these shrewd officers have been charging the state for more days than there are in the year, one able financier's account showing a charge for November 31, a unique and hitherto unknown date in lowa, so the grand jury says. The greedy way in which those railway commissioners first snatchd at, then drop ped that trip to Washington like a Doy seizing a hot potato, was enough to make even a sphinx smile. -And now after at tempting to snatch the poor governor's brass-bound, anti-railway renomination laurels from off his very brow, the com mission is credited with having privately remarked that those crowns are fearfully prickly anyway and that on closer inspec tion the scepter had an ominous resemb blance to a boomerang. Since the Chicago university football team chose stag dinner and theater, in stead of girl party and dances the Chi cago co-ed's graduating thesis promise to be entitled. "The Decline and Fall of Chivalry among Football Heroes." Some one ought to get out an injunc tion against that anti-vaccination debate. It Is distinctly dangerous. If we are con vinced by Dr. Clarke we will go unvac cinated and get smallpox, if we agree with Dr. Ohage we will be vaccinated and have lockjaw. Gen. Brooke says that soldiers who get drunk on cider must not be harshly treat ed. This may be all right for the general but let no misguided military individual think for a moment that such an excuse will go with The home officer. Here the explanations will have to be as full and as satisfactory as before. The decision as to whether the "consti tution follows the flag," and whether the Philippines are subject to our Taws seems to be much the same condition as Miss Flora McFlimsey's engagement which she interpreted herself, as "That sort of '.engagement, you see, Which is binding on you, but not bind ing on me." iifeTßiC/ib In the little space o-f one year Miss Ger trude Coghlan's art has advanced a num ber of steps. Thoie who saw her play the part of Becky Sharp a year ago and who saw her again in the same role last night at the Metropolitan must have been impressed with this advance. And Miss Coghlan deserves to be congratulated. She has youth and she has beauty, un usual beauty. So many actresses would have been content with such generous natural endowments. It is to Miss Cogli lan's credit that she has not been so content. A year ago she was an exceed ingly pretty woman who uttered with charming emphasis the worldly lines Thackeray has put into the mouth of ins intensely interesting feminine creation. Seldom, however, were those lines con vincingly uttered. Not once, perhaps, did she approach one's conception of the character of "Vanity Fair's" brainy hero ine. Last night, however, she was Becky after a fashion and a very interesting fashion it was, even if one was always perfectly sure that it was Thackeray's fashion. At least she presented to her audience one conception of the character, a clear cut, generous sized "conception that was, always impressive. As played by Miss Coghlan, Becky Sharp is a gambler, a daring but always level headed gamb er, who permits herself no regret simply be cause she is uncapable of regret; who plays always for high stakes and who, in the end, proves herself a game loser. It is when the greatest display of heart lessness is called for that Miss Coghlan is at her best. Her facial language is as expressive as her voice and this is not faint praise. In the scene with Lord Steyne, the only really dramatic scene in the play, Miss Coghlan is not entirely convincing, but even in this scene her acting is a great improvement over that of last year The gowns of the period in which Becky Sharp lived serve admir ably to show off the lines of the actress' svelte figure and their colors are won drously becoming to her blonde loveliness. Miss Coghl&n is using the same version of "Vanity Fair" that she used last year. The play has some glaring faults, but it is a playable play for all that. The play wright has caught most successfully that atmosphere of worldliness and sardonic humor which both attracts and repels in the book. The support last night was fairly good. One is glad to welcome back the same "Mrs. Major O'Dowd," who was with the company last year. Miss May Donohue is the stage name of the actress who plays the part and so excellent is her Irish brogue and so convincing her hearty Irish manner one is compelled to regret that she appears so brief a time on the stage. Charles Bertam was excel lent as Rawden Crawley. James Cooper presented, with unusual skill, the char aotor of the cynical roue, Lord Styne. Edward Locke's make up as Joseph Sed ley was excellent.and his conception of the role entirely satisfactory. Joseph Fitz patrick as Sir Pitt Crawley; Hammond Dailey as his son, Pitt; and Malcolm Duncan as George Osborne are deserving of special mention. The play is well stag, ed and the costumes are historicaly cor rect. Tonight and Wednesday night Miss Coghlan will play "Colinette." Tuesday night and Wednesday matinee "Becky Sharp" will be repeated. J. M. Barries charming dramatization of ".The Little Minister" finds adequate treatment at the Grand this week. It_is a relief from the hodge podge of inflic tions of the past, a setting around which the glamour of melodrama and the ab surdity of tiresome rag time are over shadowed by wholesome merit. « "The Little Minister," a charming story of simple folk and village gossip, brings back memrories of Maud Adams and fhose who shaped its destiny. The company at the Grand this week, however, does not suffer in comparison. It is entirely ade quate, it has balance and what Is more, merit. In this mimic panorama of Scotch life, one's first search is for the minister. He and the Lady Babbie are the ones around whom this quaintest and sweetest of stories is woven, arid in the portrayal of both little is found to criticise. As Gavin Dishart, Horace Mitchell is more than satisfying, while in Miss Frances Stevens, the Lady Babbie, of Barries own crea tion, is most acceptable. As mini&ter and man, Mr. Mitchell incorporates in both the charm of book lore and naturalness, while in Miss Stevens' work there is a depth of personality and healthful humor that is charming. She is strong in the dramatic, womanly in her weakness and •natural in her love for the little minister. The picturesque characteristics of the Thrums elders and the kirk of rural Scotland is meritoriously and humor ously delineated by George Conway, J. C. Carlyle, Howard Morgan and R. B. Graham. The latter's work, particularly the scene in which duty debates with love and admiration for the village minister, is most satisfactory. Physique and voice are in perfect sympathy with the char acter. Cecil Kingstone, as Rob Dowe, is excel lent, while in the work of Miss Mary B. Henderson there is much to admire. Her dialect is perfect and her portrayal of the village gossip above criticism. The remainder of the cast is all that could be desired. The scenic effects and stage settings are thoroughly in sympathy with the home and period of the story. Phil Sheridan's City Sports company which opened at the Star yesterday, has several strong features, and three cf them won about as vociferous encores as have been heard at this amusement resort this season. The opening is an old-time farce which is very much "Me- Fadden's Flats," only it is not quite so yellow. It has a warm finish, however, which effaces the memory of its tedious ness. The Speck brothers, two sawed-off comedians, have a boxing match that is lively and ludicrous. In the olio, John B. Leonard and Susie Fulton have a do mestic sketch in which some good char acter work is done. Jennie Grovini and Edith Murray have a turn in which they mix up acrobatic stunts with songs anl dances. None of their feats are wonder ful, but the girls are lively and pretty so it "goes." Walter Ardell, the musical director of the company, with -.ichy Craig as an assitant,. presents a musical turn with some real music, and Craig is quite a capable comedian. A skit depict ing what occurred in a thirty minute's stop of a vaudeville troupe at a country hotel had some genuine fun in it, chiefly furnished by Crissie Sheridan, who is getting to be a little too stout for the Amazon march, but is a success as an impersonator of the popular idea of Mrs. Carrie Nation. The basket ball feature is retained this season and the girls play for ten minutes as if really in earnest. The singing and dancing is fairly well done. F. J. Carroll, in sentimental bal lads, being one of the best features of the entertainment. I /Thp (Slake some£ ome-Jtud!f M 4/im kjIUU& & Course .... An introduction to BY 

GEORGE-F. M'KIBBEN, A. M. LESSOX VI. :';-:_• Tiie Reflexive Verb. - ' '-.; " : :62.r Spanish employs" on a vast : scale) the reflexive verb, ,vwhose j subject is i^epre : sen ted ?as acting " upon itself. It has jin translation four -English- equivalents: (1). .•an: intransitive \ verb;^(2)?a* verb with :an indefinite ; subject, one, they, people,-: etc.; '■ (3). a passive "verb ? (4) : rarely; a reflexive • verb, which in ; its ; plural - forms • may ; have .a reciprocal meaning.■-.";?' -,■-." . ~ . (a.) The reflexive pronouns are in the singular—me, te se; in the plural—nos. Os, se. In theory they are direct or in direct objects of the verb and denote the same person or thing as the subject. Since the plural reflexive pronouns are ambiguous, denoting cither the reflexive or the reciprocal idea, they arc often ex plained or strengthened by adding cer tain expressions—el uno al otro, unos a ctros, la una al otro, etc. (meaning one another, to each other), when the object pronouns are regarded as reciprocal; but when these are reflexive we may find a sil mismo, a sil mismos, etc., meaning himself, to himself, themselves, etc. (b) Section 3f, f, contains the necessary information about the position of the re flexive pronouns. (c) The verb which we choose as a model for the reflexives is alabarse, to praise oneself, to glory or boast. Principal parts—Alabarse, alabandos©3, alabadoso, yo me alabo, yo me alabel. Indicative present — 1 praise myself, boast, etc., yo me uiu.bo, tul te alabas, el, se alaba. V. se alaba, nostros nos alabamos, vostros vos alabais, ellos ss alaban, VV. se alaban. Imperative affirmative—Alabate3, praise thyself; alabese3, let him boast; ala beseSV.,' boast; alabemonos3, let us boast; alabaos2, boast (ye); alabenseJ, let them boast; alabenseSVV., boast. Imperative negative—Do not praise thy self or boast, etc., no te alabes, no se ala be, no se alabe V., no nos alabemos, no os alabeis, no se alaben, no se alaben (d.) The forms given above represent sufficiently the simplest tenses. The com pound tenses (reflexive verbs have no passive voice) are formed with the aux iliary haber, to have, as shown in the following synopsis: Indicative mode—Perf., I have praised myself, etc., y 0 me he alabado; plupf , [ had praised myself, etc., yo roe habia2 alabado; past anterior, I had praised my self, etc., yo me habe alabado; fut. pf., I shall have praised myself, etc., yo me habrel alabado. Subjective mode—Perf., I may have praised myself, etc., yo me haya ala bado; first plupf., I had praised myself, etc., yo me hubiera alabado; second Plupf., I had praised myself, etc., yo me hubiese alabado; fut. pf., I shall have praised myself, etc., y0 me habiere ala bado. Conditional perfect, I should have prais ed myself, yo me habria2 alabado. Examples of the reflexive verbs in use-' be enganya, he deceives himself- se en ganya a sU mismo, he deceives his own self; se enganyan, they deceive them selves or each other; se enganyan el uno ai otro, they deceive each other Me approvecharel del permiso que V me ha dado, I shall avail myself of the per mission which you have given me Me lavaba las manos. I was washing my hands. Se escriben muchas cartas todos ' los dias, many letters are written every day. En Madrid se vive comodamente m Madrid one lives comfortably ">De auel se trata?

Le que r.o se puebe remediar se ba de aguantar what can't be cured must be endured' Cuando una puerta se cierra ciento se abren, when one door is closed a hun dred open. The Impersonal Vesbs. G3. The action of the verb is represent ed as without subject and object. The only form employed is the third singular. A few impersonal verbs, not those refer ring to the weather, sometimes use eilo it, as subject. The only impersonal verb thus far used is haber, in the sense of there is, there are, etc, explained in sec tion 49. Many verbs are used only as im personal, as amanecer, to dawn; anochec er, to grow dark; helar, to freeze; Hover, to rain; tronar, to thunder; ventear, to blow. Others are acaecer and acontecar, to happen; bastar, to suffice; constar, to be evident; convenir, to be fitting; import ar, to be important, to matter; parecer, to seem; precisar, to be necessary; also ser and estar. to be, when followed by do and an infinitive, or by a noun or ad jective. A few reflexive verbs appear in the impersonal use. "^ Examples of the impersonate in use— Nieva y graniza, it snows and hails; triie na, it thunders, tromaba toda la nohe it thundered all night; ello es que no vive en esta casa, the fact is that he does not live in this house; llueve ahora, it raj;is now, estal lloviendo (see section 55, a) it is raining, acaece or acontece, it hap pens; basta, it is enough. There are many impersonal expressions containing ser and estar, to be; and haceE^. to make—es lastima3, it is a pity; estal claro or hace claro, it is clear weather; es de esperar, lit is to be looked for or hoped for; era demasiado tarde ver la cin dad. it was too late to see the city; hace toda una semana, it is a whole week or a whole week ago; hace frio, caldo, viento, it is cold, warm, windy; era menester yerla para creerlo, it was necessary to see it in order to believe it; esmenester mu cha paciencia, much patience is neeVd. Some of the above examples are not strictly impersonal, but the following are, although involving reflexive verbs—se me figura; it imagines itself to me, that is, 1 imagine; se me olcida simepre. I always forget; se me permite, it is permitted me; permitase al dador visitar per una vez las Reales posensiones, etc., let it be al lowed the person presenting (this) to visit once the royal possessions, etc. 64. Adverbs—The most numerous are those formed by adding the suffix—anente (meaning the same as our suffix—ly) to an adjective—to the feminine form of an adjective in o, but to the common form of most others. Examples: Aspera mente, harshly, eternamente, fixedly, hondamente, deeply, pesadamente, heav ily; bastantemente, sufficiently, casual mente, casually, felizmente, happily, fre cuentemente, frequently, inutilmente, uselessly, maqulnalmente, mechanically, negligentemente, negligently, recient mente, recently. But before a past parti ciple we find recien instead of reciene mente; los recien casados, the newly married. (a) When several adverbs in-^mente oc cur in succession, the ending appears only with the last, being understood with the preceding: Clceron hablaba sabia, elegante y eloeuentemente, Cicero spoke wisely, elegantly and eloquntly. (b) Instead of forming adverts in— mente we may use equivalent phrases. Thus instead of negligentemente, negli gently, we usually find; de una manera negligente, in a negligent manner, or con negligencia, with negligence. (c) Adverbs of place are: aqui(i), here, aca(i), hither, alli(i), ahi(i), there, alla(i), thither; abajo, down, arriba, up; cerca or junto, near; debajo, beneath, delante, before, dentro, within, inside; atras and detras, behind; fuera, outside or away, lejos, far, mas lejos, farther, lejisimos or muy lejos, very far—and others. (d) Adverbs of time are: Ahora, now, anoche, last night, antes, before, aun, still, ayer, yesterday, antayre, day be fore yesterday, hoy, today, jamas, ever and never, lucego, soon, mahana, tomor row, nunca, never, siempre," always, to davia, still or as yet, ya, already, now, etc. (c) Others are classified aa adverbs—of quality, order, response, negation, c-tc. Examples: Bastante or harto, enough, sufficiently, casi, almost, no, n^ and no, si(l), yes, tambien, also, too, tampoco, neither, acaso or qniza(i), or quizas (i), perhaps: alto, loudly, bajo, low or in a low tone; bien, well, mal, ill or badly; muc-ho, much, apenas. scarcely, demasia do or sobrado, too or too much, may, very or very much, poco, little. (f) Many pfarases serve as adverbs; a la ligera, lightly or superficially, al paso. slowly, at a walk, en lo sucesivo, hence- GEORIiK F. M'KinBEV. A. M., ••■-. .:. ■■:. ■ v .; .-..

First ria.ss of Peculiar or Irrt'niilni 1 Verbs. 65. Let us continue the study of lh'± verbs, taking up those (X) that expand or diphthongize the accented stem vowel, changing c to ie and o (rarely v) to ue, and (2) those that undergo a consonant change (often only a change in spelling) at Ihe end of the stem. In section ■!->. ;. and b, under conjugation I some of these vetbs are briefly described—ateutar, to encourage, sonar, to ring, costar, to cost, empezar, to begin, negar, to deny, and others. These should now be reviewed and with them studied certain verbs of conj. 11. and conj. 111., which have one or both of these peculiarities. We give the principal parts of a few: (a) To hear or understand, entender, entendiendo, cntendido, entiendo, entendi (.1); to lose, perder, perdiendo. perdido, pierdo, perdi(l); to gi'ind, moler, molirn do. molido, muelo, moii(l); to bite, mor der, mordiendo, mordido, muerdo, mordi (1); to move; mover, movlendo, movido, mui'vo, movi(l). These five verbs all have the first peculiarity, diphthongizing the stem-vowel under the ascent. This occurs in the present tenses as seen In the fol lowing: Perder, to lose. Ind. Ires. 1 lose, etc.—pierdo, pierdes, plerde, perdemos, perdeis, pierden. Subj. Pres. I may los?, etc.—pierda, pierdas. pierda, pierdamos, pierdais, pier dan; imperative—pierde, lose (thou), pierded, lose (ye), pierda A', and pierdan W., lose. Mover, to move, Ind. Pros. I move, etc. —muevo, mueves, mueve, raovemos, mo veis, mueven: Subj. Pres., I may move, etc.— mueva, muevas, movamos, movais, niuevon; Imperative—mueve, move (thou), moved, move (ye), mueva V., and mue van VV., move. (b) To cook, cocer, poeiendo, cocidc, cuezo, coci(l); to twist, torcer, torciendo, torcido, tuerzo, torci(l); to conquer, ven eer, venciendo, vencido, venzo, venci(l>; to gather, coger, cogiendo, cogido, cojo, cogi(l); to direct, dirigir, dirigiendo, dl rigido, dirijo, dirigi(l); to luck, career, careciendo, carecido, carezco, careci(l); to know, be acquainted, conocer, cono ciendo, conocido, conozco, conocci(l); to shine, lucir, luciendo, lucido, luzco, luci(i); to be born, nacer, naciendo, nacido, nazco, naci(l). Jn these nine verbs the clisinge in spelling is chiefly to avoid a change in sound. (c) To turn or return, volver. volviendo, vuelto (not volvido), vuelvo, volvi(l); to smell, oler, oliendo, olido, huelo, oli(l). In these verbs we see the vowel becomes a diphthong under the accent, and note in one the past participle and in the other the indicative present as peculiar be sides. (d) Class I. contains verbs numbering nearly 350, and belonging to all there con. jugations. Pnralelo Xliitre Washing-ton y Boli- vnr (Conclndod>.
