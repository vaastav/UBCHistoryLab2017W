Washington, Dec. 5.-Congress reassembled to-day under circumstances ol; unascal publio interest; Tbe same congress, six months ago, declared ^^irar against Spain, and now, with the "var fought and won, it came together for the first legislative consideration of tibe questions developed by the eventful ?ioutbs just past. The spirit of the occasion was not, however, one of immediate expectancy, for the few months lefc tbe existence af the 56tb congress gave promise of little more &an a beginning on the momee toas policies and problems growing ont of tbe war As usual, all Washington turned tts attention to the capitol for that gala ?vent which marks the opening "day of a session . The weather imposed no barriers, for tbe barr i cane of yesterday bad given way to clearing skies and balmy air. Long before the noon boar j itben the senate and bouse began their vrerk, the corridors were filled with surging crowds, centering in the rotunda and statuary ball and pushing towards tbe private galleries. No evidences remained of tbe explosion and fire which recently ravaged tbe building. Wheo the senate -convened, the chamber presented a noble and beau? tiful appearance. By ll o'clock the public and private galleries were filled almost to their capacity with a distin? guished assemblage, including many ladies in brilliant attire. On tho floor, tbe display of flowers was unusually beautiful, even for the opening day of a session of congress. The odor of the flowers filled the cham ber. Through the courtesy of the vice ? president, the members of the Joint High commission were admitted to the Soor of the senate, and were the recipients of much attention. Just before the session was called to order, several well-known members of ?the diplomatic corps' appeared in the diplomatie gallery. Among them were .Sir Julian Paunoefote, ambassador of Great Britain to the United States and dean of the corps, with a party from the British embassy ; Mr. Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese minister, and party ; Mr. Ye Pom Chin, tbe Korean, minis? ter, was also preset. All ^ere interested spectators of the opening scenes of the session, and attentive listeners to the reading of the president's message. Darling a recess of three-quarters of s an hoar, while the senate wss awaiting j the presentation of the message from ? tbe president, the members of the Joint High commission held an informal levee greeting personally nearly aM of the members of the American senate. The reading of the president's mes sage, whian ooonpied two hoare and eighteen minutes, was received with very careful attention for an hour, bu% . after that tbe senators drifted to the ' cloak tooms or tbe committee rooms ?here they could pernee the message ar their leisure io the printed copies which bad been famished them. When the clerk bad oonoluded the reading. Mr. Mason, of Illinois, pre? sented a telegram from Mr Pritchard, of North Carolina, announcing that i illness prevented bis attendance at the opening cf the session. At 3.46 tbe senate adjourned. IN THE 

HOUSE. In the bouse tbe greetings of tue members were most cordial and there was no outcropping of partisan raocor to sar the occasion. One of the most striking incidents was the cordial meeting between the floor leaders of the respective sides, Messrs. Dingley and Bailey In view of the gossip a bo af tbe possibility of Mr. Bailey being deposed as the minority leader it is significant that the speaker named Mr. Baily as the minority member of the committee to wait upon the president, an honor always bestowed npon the recognized leader of the minority Speaker Reed received a warm welcome from both sides of the boase when be ascended the rostrum to caW tba house to order bat perhaps the greatest personal ovation to any mern ber was that given Maj. Gen Wheeler, of Alabama, who has not been seen by many of his old colleagues since he went to the front at the bead of the cavalry divinion of Geo. Shatter's army. The floral tributes to day ?ere unusually numerous and made the ball a veritable bower of beautiful flowers. Tbe proceedings themselves were doll, all interest centering in the reading of tbe president*? message For over two hours tbe clerk droned through the long document, bat the interest of members tod spectators never flagged. No expressions of approval or disap? proved interrupted the reading At 3.50 the house adjourned until to morrow. - i i i President's Message.

Notwithstandi Spain's promise of a plan to supprc the insurrection, Cuba continu fighting and there was no prospect peace except the physical exhaust! of either combatant in sight, wh the Maine was blown up last Febr ary under circumstances of a sus] cious nature. The horror stirred t nation's heart profoundly. It is evidence of the sturdy go? sense of the people, already deep touched by preceding events Cuba, that did not move them to ? instant and desperate resolve, b they patiently awaited the finding tba court of inquiry. Matters co vinced the people that a crisis was band and it needed but a brief no to congress for the needed prepar tions for any emergency whereupc that body appropriated fifty millie dollars for national defense.

MCKINLEY/' mum i I \\umm CUBAN AND PHILIPPINE DEBTS. Madrid, Dec. 4-The government bas not reached afu!! decision regard? ing the Cuban and Philippine debts, but the official Gazette today pub? lishes an announcement that the drawing for the redemption of the Cuban bonds will occur on December 10. The speculation io the Cuban and Philippine debts on the bourse has seriously displeased the cabinet. The rise in those securities is attributed to the report that the government will devote the indemnity received from the United States to the colonial indebtedness, regarding which no decisive resolutions have been taken by the ministers An official dispatch from the Yisayas in the Philippines announces that the insurgents are redoubling their attacks upon Iioilo The gov? ernment's adyices say : "The rebels have now their guns trained on the city and fire in the defenses nightly. Our troops maintain a spirited de? fense and have killed large numbers of the enemy."

Paris, Dec. 4 -The United Stares and Spanish peace commissions held private sessions today. Afterward representatives of both bodies predicted confidently that the treaty would be signed within a week unless unforeseen complications arise. The American commissioners say there is oo foundation for the ieh orts circulated in the United States and cabled back here that President Mc Kinley has forwarded to the American commissioners instructions to insist unyieldingly upon a coaling base in the Carolines, and that the Spaniards are endeavoring to renew their opposition to a cession of the Philippines. Both commissions recognize that the latter question is settled.

FRAMING THE TREATY Questions Discussed Yester? day-Commissioners Report Progress. Paris, Dec. 5.-The American peace commissioners held a long conference this morning beginning at 8 o'clock and only Lad brief recesses for lunch before going to the ?foreign office to meet the Spanish commis sioners at 3 o'clock p m. The American, japparently, had changed the form, if not the substanc?, of their demands, aa a result of their deliberations during the past three days. The joint commission was in ses? sion for over four hours Much of the discussion concerned details as to the guaranteeing of the rights of Spanish citizens in the ceded col onies. The debate was occasionally eoer getic and the Spaniards, on emerg? ing, appeared to be dejected Secretary Ujeda, of the Spanish j commission, when questioned after the meeting as to the progress made, j answered excitedly: "1 am almost mad I cannot talk. We are making progress." The Americas commissioners de? clined to say anything further than that the progress made was satisfac? tory . The Spanish commissioners have received authority to bind their gov ernment on certain matters, but there are yet important questions on which their instructions are unsatisfactory, and it is likely that many of the details involved in the change of sovereignty in the Spanish colonies will be left for the settlement in the regular diplomatic process when rela? tions between the two governments are resumed The history of the document which will certify the passing of the oldest colonial power in the world and the advent of the newest, was epitomized by Judge Day this evening in a single sentence : "A peace treaty can contain anything which the victors put in it The Americans had listened for hours wiih their customary patience to the technicalities convoked by the Spaniards with their customary shrewdness and persistency against every proposal making for the dis raemberment of their empire. Sena tor Frye, whose unconcealed con I tempt for diplomatic quibblings excites the astonishment of the punctilious Castillans, had stalked home, his patience exhausted The burden of the Spanish arguments was that, matters outside the bare cession and evacuation of the conquered ter ritorie8, which the Ameu'cans pro Dosed to cover by the treaty, were beyond the legitimate and customary scope of a peace treaty Finally Judge Day summarized the Ameri can position in the foregoing memor able utterance It was given and taken in good spirit and from that moment the proceedings were entirely friendly The session accomplished much Eight open question?, were canvassed, seven being practically settled with ? out noteworthy friction The com missioners decline to .say what con ! elusion was reached, but the^bargains for a coaling station in the Carolines was cot cemented, and, according to present prospects, it is likely to fail --- Syiaey Smith's Joke. Sydney Smith was very happy in his country life, and his children caught his spirit of delight over common things. They loved animals and spent long hours iu training them. One little beast, a baby donkey, became under their tuition perhaps the most accom- I plished of his species and unconscious- j ly gave rise to a quatrain which now i belongs to the fame of Sydney Smith, j The donkey was a well educated chap, j He would walk up stairs, follow the family in their rambles like a aog and when they entered his meadow mn to meet them with ears down and tail erect, braying joyously, y One day, when Billy's head was crowned with Sowers ni 1 he was heing trained with a handkerchief fora bridle, Mr. Jeffrey unexpectedly arrived. He joined in the sport and to the children's infinite delight mounted BilJy. Thus he was proceeding in triumph when Sydney Smith aud his wife, with three friends, returned from a walk and took in the festal scene. The great man advanced, with extended hands, and greeted his old friend in au impromptu which has become familiar to the read? ing world: Witty as Horatius Flaccus, As great a Jacobin as Gracchus.
