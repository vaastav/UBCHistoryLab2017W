The president urges such nctlon as he believes will Increase American trade abroad, nnd says "Another Instrumentality Indispensable to the unhampered and natural develop ment of American commerce Is merchant marine. All mailllme nnd commercial na tions recognize the Importance of this factor. The greatest commercial nations our cnmpetllois, Jealously foster their merchant murine Perhaps nowhere Is the need for rapid nnd direct mall, pas Fenger and freluht communication unite so urgent ns between the t'nlted Slates nnd I.ntln America We can secure In no other quarter of the world such Imme dlnto benefits tn friendship nnd com merce nn would (low from tho establish ment of direct lines of communication with the countries of Tatln America ade quate tn meet the requirements of a rap Idly Increasing appreciation of the reel procnl dependence of the countries of the western hemisphere upon each other's productH, sympatl Ics and nsslstance.

Criticism of the Tariff. Tn tho space ikuitcd to tho tariff tho president says: "Tho schedules of the rates of duty In the I'ayno tariff nt t have been subjected to a great -ileal of criticism, some of It Just, moro of It unfounded, and too much misrepresentation. The net was adopted In pursuance of a declaration by the par ty which Is responsible for It that cus toms bill should b" a tnrlff for tho pro. tectlon of home industries, the measure of tho protection to be tho difference be tween the cost of produolng the Imported nrtlcln abroad and the cost of producing It nt home, togethrr with such addition to that dlffeienco n might give a reasonable profit to the home producer. The basis for the criticism of this tariff Is that In respect to a number of the schedules the declared measure was not followed, but a higher difference n tallied or InsertTd by way of undue ill--- rlmlnatlon In favor of certain Industries .mil manufactures. Lit tle, If nny. of t e criticism of the tariff has been direct, d against the prntc-'ctlvo principle above stated; but the main body of the criticism I. as been based on tho at tempt to confoi , i to the measure of pro tection was not honestly nnd sincerely adhered to." The president ilso refers to the appoint ment of a board of experts to Investigate the cost of prod ictlon of various articles Included In the schedules of the tariff, and concludes: "Whether or t ot the protective policy Is to be continued, and the degree of protec tion to bo nccopled to our home Indus tries, are questions which the people must decide through their chosen representa. lives. Hut whatever policy Is adopted, It Is clenr that the necessary legislation should be based on nn Impartial, thot otigh and continuous studv of the facts." Recommends Parcels Post. The adoption e.f the parcels post Is again adopted. On this subject President Taft says: "With respect to the parcels post, I respectfully recommend Its adop tion on nil ratal delivery routes, and that 11 pounds the International limit hu made the limit of carriage In such post. The same nrgmm nt Is made against the parcels post that wns made agnlnst the postal savings bank Hint It Is Introduc ing the government Into u business which should lie conducted by private persons and Is paternalism. The postolllco depart ment has a gr'.it plant and n great or ganization, re.-e blng Into the most remote hamlet of tin- t'nlted Stntes. and with this machlncr It Is nble to do a great many things i onomlcally that If a new organization wie necessary It would be Impossible to do without extravagant ex penditu res." Department of Justice. Discussing t! affairs of the department of Justice, tli. president says: "I Invite psp. i la I attention to the prose cutions unde, the federal law of the so. oal'nl 'bink.t shops.' and of thope si In mes to d' fraud in which the use of the mall Is .in essentlnl part of the fraudulent con-piracy, prosecutions which have saved Ignorant and weak members of the public and are saving them bun dle ds of millions of dollars. The viola tions of the anti-trust law prcrent per hajs the mo.-, Important litigation befoie the dcpai'imnt, and the number of cases Id. d shuns the aclhlty of tho govern nn "t In infuielng that statute. "In a special message list year T broad t t,, tho attention of congress the pr. I'tiit. nnd wisdom of enacting u gen i:i! law providing for the Incorporation i'f in. In-trial nnd other companies engaged in int.rs'-ito commerce, and I renew my inum delation In that behalf." Tin ii'ing need In the t'nlted States of cb, -,i. nlng the cost of litigation by slmpbfNing Judicial procedure and ex pediting final Judgment Is pointed out nnd action looking to correction of those evils Is urged The pit sldent recommends an Increase In tic- salaries of federal Judges. Postal Affairs. In regard to postal matters the presi dent points with pililo to Its piesent e(TI cli nt management and the recent reduc tion In the deficit. The present unre stricted franking pilvllege comes In for iiimuent with n suggestion for the adop tion of better methods for Its regulation. Abolish Navy Yards. The president calls attention to certain reforms urged by the sccietary of the navy which ho recommends f,,r ndoptlon, and continues: "The secretary of the navy has given personal examination to every navy yard, and has studied tho uses of the navy yards with refercnco to the necessities of our licet. With a tleet considerably less than half the slzo of that of the llritlsh navy, 'we have shipyards more than double the number, and there nre several of these shipyards expensively equipped with modern mchlnery, which, after Investigation the secretary of the navv believes to be entliely useless for nawil purposes, lie asks authority to abandon cortrdn of them nnd to move their machinery to other places, whero It can be mnde of use." Speaking of our foreign relations the president says: "During the past year the foreign relations of the t'nlted Stntes have i ontlnued upon a basis of friendship and good understanding. "The year has been notable as witness ing the paiillc settlement of two Impor tant International contioversles before tho pcimanent court of The Hague. "The arbitration of the fisheries dispute between the United States and Orent Itiitaln. which has been the sourco of nearly continuous diplomatic correspond ence since the fisheries convention of lSR has given nn award which Is satisfactory to both parties. This arbitration Is par ticularly noteworthy not only because of the eminently Just results secured, but also because It Is the tlrst atbltratlou held under the general arbitration trenty of April ). IMS, between the United Stntes and Circat lirltnln, and disposes of a con troversy tho settlement of which has re slsted every other resource of diplomacy and which for nearly ninety years has been the cause of friction between two countries whose common Interest lies tn maintaining the most friendly and cordial relations with each other. President Taft makes a few- recommen dations for changes In the Interstate com merce law and says; "Except as obove, I do not recommend nny nmendment to tho Interstate com merce law ns It stands. I do not now recommend any nmendment to the anti trust law. In other words. It seems to me that the existing legislation with reference to the regulation of corpora tions nnd the restraint of their business has reached n point where we can stop for n while and witness tho effect of tho vigorous execution of the laws of tho statute books In restraining the abuses . w hich certninty inu exist and which I roused tho public to demand rsform."
