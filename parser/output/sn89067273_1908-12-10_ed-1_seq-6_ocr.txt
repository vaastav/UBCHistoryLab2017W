Control of Corporation. As regard the great corporation en Tgea in inieraiatn uuaincas, ami rspc- .TuftJly the railroad. I can only repeat -what I have alroudy again and again laid 'In my messages to the cotigrea. I be- Ill v that under the InterHlale clauae of VJ: conatitutlon the United Htatcs haa Complete and paramount right to eon trol all agencies of Interstate commerce. auid I bellev that the national govern lie nt alone can exercise this light with wladnm ami rfti-cllvencsa so aa both to ei ure Juatlr from, and to do justice to. the great corporatlona which aro tha noat Important factors In modern bust meia. I bellev that It Is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all com. tiinatlona a I done by tha Hhcrman ntt-truat law, because audi a law can be enforced only Imperially and un equally, and Ita enforcement worka a! moat aa much hardahlp aa good. I trongly advocate that Inatead of an un wrlaa effort to prohibit all combination. then ahall ba aubitltuted a law wlUch hall expressly permit coinblnallona which are In tha Interest of tha public, tut shall at tha same time glva to aoma agency In tha national foYlrnment full power of control and supervision over them. One of tha chief feature of thla control should be securing entire pub licity In all matter which tha publlo tiaa a light to know, and furthermore, tha power, not by Judicial hut by execu tive action, to prevent or put a atop to very form of Improper favoritism or ther wrongdoing. The railway of tha country ahould ba put completely under tha Interstate com merce commission and removed from tha domain of tha anti-truat law. Tha twr of tha cotnmlaalon ahould ba mad thoroughgoing, ao that It could exercise complete auiiervlsloa and control over tha lasua of aecurltlea aa wall aa over tha raising and lowering of rataa. Aa regards rales, at least, Utla power should V summary. . . .

Telegraph and telephone companies aa gaged In tnteratata buatneaa ahould be put under the jurlsdlotiow. of the Inter state commerce commission. It la very earnestly te be wis lied that our people, through their rep resents. Uvea, should act la thla natter. It is te the Interest of all of ua that I liar ahould be a preaulaia put upon -dividual Initiative e.i4 UuUrlduai pacify, and a ample reward for the t directing Intelligences alone com petent to manage tha great business op erations of to-day. It la well te keep In mind that exactly aa the anarchist la tha worst enemy of liberty and tha reaction ary tha worst enemy of order, ao tha men who defend tha rights of property have moat to fear from tha wrongdoers of great wealth, and tha men who are championing popular rights nave moat to fear from the demagoguea who In tha name of popular lights would do wrong to and oppress honest business men, honest men of wealth: for tha success of either typs of wrongdoer neceessrlly In vitee a violent reaction agalnet tna cause tha wrongdoer nominally upholds. , , . Naad of Centralization. The proposal to make tha na tional anvrrnment aupreme over, ana therefore to glva It complete control over, the rallroada and other Instrument of Interstate commerce Is merely a propos al to carry out to tha letter one of tha prime purposes. If not the prime purpose, for which the constitution waa lounaeo. It does not represent centralisation. It renresenla merely the acknowledgment of the patent fact that centralisation haa already come In burflnrs. If this Irre sponsible outside builnraa power la to be controlled In the Intereat of the genernl public It can only be controlled In one war: by giving adequate power oi con trol to the one aovcrelgnty capable of e- ercldng au h power-the national govern ment. To abandon the effort for national control mean to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to render like ly continual burnt of action by tnt leg lalaturea. which cannot achieve the pur poae aniiRht for. but which can do a great deal of damace to the corporation without conferring any real bcnellt on the public. There ahould te regulation by the na tional government of the great Intcratnte corporation. Including n almple method of account keeping, publicity, aupcrvlalon uf the laaue of acurltle. nholltlnrt of rebates end of special privilege. There hould lie ahort-tlme franchise for all corporation-- engaired In public bualncaa: Including tho corporation which get power from water right. There ahould ba national ua well n a'ate gonrdlnnnhlp of mine and foreata. The labor b'glHla- tlon hereinafter referred to ahould con currently l enacted Into lnw. To acompllali thla. mean a certain In crease In the use of--not the creation of power, by tho central government. The power already exists; It does not have to lie created; the only question Is hether It ahall be uaed or left Idle and meanwhile tho corporation over which the power ought to be excrclaed will not remain Ml. The dancer to Amer ican democrncy Ilea not In the lenat In the concentration of administrative power In reaponalblc and accountable hands. It Ilea In having tint power Insutllclently concentrated, so that no one can be held rctonaltilft to the people for Its use. t.'oncentrated power Is palpable, visible. reaponaltde, easily reached, quickly held to account.

In this respect the generosity of tha United States towards Its employes comperes most unfavored bly with that of every country In Ba rope even the poorest. I renew my recommendation made In a pravloua message that half-holldayg be granted during summer to all wave workera In government employ , I also renew my recommendation that the principle of tha eight-hoar day ahould aa rapidly and aa far aa practi cable be extended to the entire work being carried on by tha government! tha preaent law ahould ba amended to embrace contracta on those publlo worka which the preaent wording of the act aeema to exclude.

On the whole ther la no body of publlo aervanta who do aa valuable work, nor whose moneyed reward la ao Inadequate compared to their work. He ginning with the supreme court the Judges ahnuld have their aalarlea dou bled.

There ore many matter affecting tabor nd the stalua of tho wageworker to which I ahould like to draw your atten tion, but an exhaustive dlacusKlon of tho rohlcm In all Ita napect la not now nec eaanry. 1 believe In a steady ef fort, or perhap It would be more accurate to say In steady efforts In many different directions, to bring aliout a condition of affairs under which the men who work with hand or with brain, the laborer, tha superintendents, the men who produce the market and the men who find a market for the articles produced, ahnll own A far grenter share than nt present of the wenlth they pro duce, and be cnnbled to Invest It in tha tool and Inatrutnents by which alk work I carried on. A fur na possible I hope to see a frank recognition of the advan tage conferred by machinery, organisa tion and division of labor, accompanied by nn effort to bring about a larger aharo In the ownership by wage-worker of rail way, mill nnd factory. I'ostal Having bank will mnka It easy for the poorest to keep their sav ings In abaolute safety. Tho regulation of tho nntlonal highway must be such that they ahull serve all people with equal Justice. Corporate llnances must be supervised no aa to make It far safer tb:in at present for tho man of small means to Invest hi money In stocks. There must be prohibition of child la bor, t..mlnutlnn of women Inbor, short ening of hour of all mechnnicnl labor: stock watering ahould bu prohibited. and stock gambling ao far a Is possi ble discouraged. There ahould ha a progreaslve Inheritance tag on large fortunes. Industrial education should be encouraged. Aa far aa possible we hould lighten the burden of taxation on the email man. We should put premium upon thrift, hard work, and business energy; but these qualities cease to ba the main factors In accu mulating a fortune long before that fortune reaches a point where It would bo serloualy affected by any Inherl tance tax such aa I propose. It I emi nently right that the nation ahould fig the term upon which the great for tunea are Inherited. They rarely do good and they often do harm to tho who Inherit them In their entirety. There ahould no longer be any palter Ing with the queatlon of taking care of the wageworker who. under our pre ent Industrial ayatom, become killed. crippled, or worn, out aa part of tha regular Incidents of a given busi ness. Aa far aa roncerna thoae who have been worn out, I call your attention to the fact that deflnlt atepa toward providing old-age pen sion have been taken In many of our private Industrie.

Our present aystem, or rather no aya tern, worka dreadful wrong, and la ot benefit to only one claaa of people the lawyera. when a workman la Injured what he need la not an axpenalva and doubtful lawault, but the certainty of relief through Immediate admlnlatra tlv action.

The law, paaaed at the last aeeelon tha congress .granting compensation to certain classes or employes of the gov ernment .ahould ba extended to Include all employes of tbs . government and hould be made more liberal In Ita terms. Tbers Is no good ground for tho distinction made In tha law be tween those engaged In hazardous oc cupations and thoae not ao en gaged. The terms of ths act pro viding compensation ahould be made mors liberal than In tha present act. A year's compensation la not a cjuate for a wage-eeruer'a family la t le event of his death by accident In the eon-e of his employment. , And la tha event of death occurring, say, ten -r eleven months after the accident, I is family would only receive aa oompt, aUoa U f aulvftltra S( tM. at ta eedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice. It Is earnestly to be desired that aome method should be devised for doing way with the long delays which now btaln In the administration of Justice. nd which operate with peculiar sever ity against persons of small means, and favor only the very criminals whom It Is most desirable to punish. These long delays In tho final decisions of nxes make In the nggrrgate a crying vll; and a remedy shout 1 be devised. Much of this Intolerable delay la duo o Improper regard paid to technical!- es w bh b nre a mere hlnderanca to Justice. In aome not, l recent cases thla over-regard for technicalities hna re- ulted In a striking denial of Justice. nd flagrant wrong to tha body politic. Labor Leaders Criticised. At the last election certain leader of rganltcd labor made a violent and weeping attack upon the entire Judl- lary of the country, nn attack couched In auch terma na to Include the moat upright, honest and broad-minded JudKca, no lens than those of narrower mind and more reatrlcted outlook. Ijiat year, before the house com mittee on Judiciary, these aama labor leadera forniulnted their de mands, specifying the bill that contained them, refualng all compro mise, stating they wished tha principle of that bill or nothing. They Insisted on n provlxlon that In a lnbor dispute no Injunction should Issue except to protect n property right, nnd specifical ly provided that the right to carry on biialnraa should not be construed na a property right; and In a second provis ion their bill made legal In a labor dis pute any act or agreement by or be- ween two or more person that would not have been unlawful If done by a single person. In other words thla bill Icgallivt blacklisting and boycotting In every form, legalising, for instance. hose forma of the secondary boycott which the anthracite coal atrlko com mission so unreservedly condemned while the right to carry on a business waa explicitly taken out from under hnt protection which the law throws over property. The demand wa made lint there should be trial by Jury in contempt ensea, thereby moat aerlously Impairing the authority of the court. Ml thla represented a course of policy which. If carried out, would mean the enthronement of class privilege In Ita crudest nnd most brtitnl form, and the destruction of one of the most essen tial functions of the Judllcary In all civ ilised lands. The violence of the crusade for thl legislation, and Its complete failure, Illustrate two truths which It la essen tial our people should learn. In the first place, they ought to teuch the worklngman. the laborer, the wage- worker, that by demanding what Is Im proper and Impossible he plays Into the hnnda of hi foe. Pitch a crude and vlcluua attack upon the court, even if It were temporarily aucceaaful, would Inevitably In the end caua a violent reaction and would band the great mass of rlllxen together, forcing them to stand by all the Judgea, competent and Incompetent alike, rather than to ee the wheel of Justice stopped. The wageworkers. the worklngmen. the laboring men of the country by the way In which they repudiated the ef fort to get them to cast their vote In response to an appeal to class hatred, have emphaslxed their sound patrlotlam and Americanism. Such an attitude Is an object lesson In good cltlxenship to the entire nation. Judicial System Sound. Our Judicial system la aound and effective at core, and It remain, and must ever he maintained tha safeguard of those principles of lib erty and Justice which Hand at tha foundation of American Institutions; for, aa Burke finely aald, when liberty and Justice ara aeparated, neither Is safe. There are, however, aome member of the Judicial body who have lagged be hind In their understanding of these great and vital changes In tha body politic, whoaa mlnda have never been opened to tha new application of tha old principle made necessary by tha ne conditions Judgea of thla atamp do last Ing harm by their decision, because they convince poor men In need of protection that tha court of tha land are pro foundly Ignorant of and out of aympathy with their needs, and profoundly Ignoran or hoatlle to any propoaed remedy. To auch men It aeema a cruel mockery to have any court decide agalnet them on tha ground that tt dealrea to preserve "liberty" In a purely technical form, by withholding liberty In any real and con etructlva aenaa. There ara certain decision by varlnu court which have been exceedingly dot rlmental to the right ot wage-worker. Thla la true of all declalona that declda that men are, by the conatitutlon, "guar anteed their liberty" to contract to enter a dangeroua occupation, or to work undesirable or Improper number of hours, or to work In unhealthy aurroundlng and therefore cannot recover damages when maimed In that occupation, and cannot be forbidden to work what th legislature decides Is en excessive num ber of hours, or to carry on tha work under eondltiona which the legislature decide to be unhealthy. Declalona auch aa thoae nullify the legislative effort to protect tha wage-workers who most need protection from those am ploy era who take advantage of their grind ing need. They halt or hamper the move ment for aecurlng better and more equi table eondltiona of labor. There la alao. I think, ground for the belief that aubatantlal Injustice Is often suffered by employes In consequence of the custom of oourta Issuing temporary Injunctions without notice to them, and puntalilng thera for contempt ot court lo Instance where, aa a matter ot fact, thsy have no knowledge of any proceed ings. Organised labor la chafing tinder the unjust restraint which oomaa from repeated resort to this plan ot procedure, Ita discontent haa been unwisely expressed, and oftea Improperly expressed, but thera la a sound baala for It, and tha or derly and law-abiding people of a com munity would be In far atronger posi tion for upholding th courts If ths un doubtedly existing abuses could be pro vided again t. Injunction Must Remain, The power of Injunction la a great equitable remedy, which ahould on ao Moouiit be. dMlroyed. fiut aaauardg ahould be erected agalnet It abuse. In aubetanee, provlatoa ahould be made that no Injunction or temporary re straining ordsr Issue otherwise than oa notice, except where Irreparable Injury would otherwise result: and In auch case hearing on tha merits of the order ahould be had within a ahort fixed pe riod, and. If not then continued after hearing, It ahould forthwith lapse. De cision should be rendered Immediately, and tha chance of delay mlnlmlaed In every way. Moreover, I believe that the procedure ahould ba sharply defined, and tha Judge required minutely to stais tns particulars both of his action and of hla reaaona therefor, ao that the congress ran If It d eel res sxamlna and Investigate the same For many of tha ahortcomlnga of- Justice In our country our people aa a whole are themselves to blame, and tha Judgea and Jurlea merely bear their hare together with the publlo aa a whole. It Is discreditable to us sa a people that there ahnuld be difficulty In convicting murderere. or In bringing to ustlce men who ss publlo servanta have been guilty of corruption, or who have profited by the corruption of publlo aervanta. The result I equally unfortunate, whether due to halrspllt- Ing technicalities In the Interpretation of law by Judges, to sentimentality and lnsa consciousness on the part of uric, or to hysteria and aenaatmnai am In the dally press. For much nf his failure of Justice no responsibility whatever Ilea on rich men a such. Wa who make up ths maas nf the people cannot shift the reapnnalblllty from our own shoulders. Hut there Is an Impnr- ant part of the failure winch haa pe- clal'.y to do with Innblllty to hold proper account men of werlth who uhave badly. Tha Modern Corporation. The huge wealth that hn been accu mulated by a few Individuals nf recent years. In what ha amounted to a so cial and Industrial revolution, has been a regard some of these Individuals made pnaelhlo only by the Improper use of the modern corporation. A certain ype of modern corporation, with Its officers and agent. It many Issue nf securities, and Ita constant consolida tion with allied undertaking, finally becomei nn Instrument so complex aa to contain a greater number of el mente that, under various Judicial de rision, lend themselves to fraud and oppression than any device yet evolved n the human brain. Corporatlona are necessary Instruments of modern busi ness. They have been permitted to become a menace largely because tha governmental representative of the people havo worked slowly In provld- ng for adequate control over them. Our great clusters ot corpora tlona, huge trusta nnd fabulously wealthy multimillionaires, employ tha very heat lawyera they can obtain to ph k flaws In stntutea after their .usage; but they also employ a clase of aecret agent who seek, under tha advice of experts, to render hostile legislation Innocuoua by making It un constitutional, often through the Inaer- tlon of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping provision against Ihn Interests of the parties Inspiring them; while the demagogue, th cor rupt creature who Introduce black mailing scheme lo "strike" corpora tion, and all who demand extreme, nnd undesirably radical, measures. show themselves to be the worst ene mies of the very public whose loud mouthed rhamplona they profess to he. Ileal damage hn been done by the manifold and conflicting Interpretation the Interstate commerco law. Con trol over tho great corporation doing Interstate buslnesa can be effective only If It I vested with full power In an administrative department, a brunch of th federal executive, carrying out a federal law; It can never be effective If divided responsibility Is left In both ths ststes and tha nation; It can never be effective If left In the hands of the court to ba decided by lawault. Respect for Law Muat Be Upheld The courts hold a place of peculiar nnd deserved sanctity under our form of gov ernment, ltespect for the law Is easen tlal to the permanence nf our Instltu tlous; and respect for the law la largely conditioned upon resiwct for the courts. It Is sn offenso against the republic to ay anything which can weaken thla re spect, save for the gravest reason and In the most carefully guarded manner. In no other nation In the world do th court wield such vat and far-reaching power aa In the United Htates. All that la nec essary Is that tho court as a whole should exercise this power with ths far alghted wisdom already ahown by thoae Judgea who acan the future while they act In the present- Let them exercise thla great power not only honestly and bravely, but with wise Insight Into the need and fixed purpoaee of the people, ao that they may do Justice, and work equity, ao that they may protect all per aona In their rights, and yet break down the barriers ot privilege, which la the foe of right. Forest Preservation. If there Is any ona duty which more than another we owe It to our children to perform at once.

Aotlon should be begun forthwith, dur ing tha present session of the oongrees. tor the Improvement of our Inland water ways action which will raault in giving ua not only navigable but aavlgatsd rivers. Until tha work of river Improvement Is undertaken In a modern way It can not have results that will meat the needs of this modern nation. The plan prvmlcea U beat bad Rulc eat results Is that of a manant commission authorised to eo-or-dlnate the work of all the government departments relating to waterways, and to frame and supervise the execution of comprehensive plan. Under auch a commission the actual work ot construc tion might be entrusted to tha reclama tion service; or to the military engineers acting with a aufliclent number of civili ans to continue the work In time of war; or It might be divided between the rec lamation service and the corps of en gineers. Funds ahould be provided from surrent revanuea If It la deemed wise therwlse from the sale of bonda. The esaentlal thing la that the work ahnuld go forward under the beet possible plan. nd with the least possible delay. The time for playing with our waterwaya la past. The country demanda results. Tho president urges that national parks adjacent to national forests be placed under the control of tha forest service of the agricultural depart ment; he alao points out the benefits derived from pure- food legislation. The message continues: Needs of the Secret Oervlce. Ljiat year an amendment waa Incor porated In tha measure providing for the secret service, which provided that there should be no detail from the secret serv ice and no transfer therefrom, Tha amendment In question wa of benefit to no one excepting to criminals, and It aerlously hampers the government In the detection of crime and the securing nf Justice. Tha chief argument In favor of the provision waa that the congressmen did not them selves wish to be Investigated by the secret service men. Very little of uch Investigation ha been done In the past; but It I true that the work of the secret service agent wa partly responsible for the Indictment end conviction of a sen ator and a congressman for land fraud In Oregon. I do not believe that It I In the public Interest to protect criminal In nny branch of tha public service, and exactly aa we have again and again dur ing the past seven years prosecuted and convicted auch crimlnala who were In the executive branch of the government ao In my belief we ahnuld be given ample meana to prosecute them If found In the legislative branch. Ilut If thl la not considered desirable a special exception could be mado In the law prohibiting tho uae of the aecret service force In Inve tlgatlng members of the congreaa. Postal Savings Banks. X again renew my recommendation for postal aavlnga banks, for deposit Ing aavlnga with the security of the government behind them. The object la to encourage thrift and economy In the wage-earner and person ot mod erata meana. It la believed that In tho aggregate vast sum of money would be brought Into circulation through th In atrumentallly ot the postal aavlnga banke. Parcel Post In my last annual message I com mended the postmastcr-gcncrat' recommondatlon for an extension of th parcel post on the rural routes. Ths establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would bs to tho mutual benefit of ths farmer and tha country storekeeper, and It la dcslrablo that tba routea. serving more thnn 10,000.000 people, ahnuld ba utilised to ths fullest practicable extent. Education. With the limited meana hitherto pro vlded. the bureau of a ducatlon hna rendered efficient service, but the con gress haa neglected to adequately sup ply the bureau with meana to meet the educational growth of the country, 1 earneatly recommend that thla un fortunate state nf affaire sa regarda tho national educational office be reme died by adequate appropriation. This recommendation Is urged by the repre aentntlvea of our common echools and great state universities and the leading rducatora, who nil unite In requesting favorable consideration and action by the congress upon this subject. The president points out the neces sity of better organization of the vari ous bureaus responsible for the public health, and urges the placing of all soldiers' homes under the Jurisdiction of the war department. Statehood. On the question of statehood the president says: I advocate the Immediate admission ot New Mexico and Arizona as state. This should be done at the preaent aeoalon of the congrca. The people of the two ter ritories have made It evident by their votes that they will not come In aa one state. The only alternative la to admit them aa two. and I trust that thla will be dona without delay. Interstate Fishsrles. I call tha attention of the congreaa to the Importance of the problem of tha fisheries In the Interstate watera. On tha Oreat Lakes we are now. under the very wise treaty of April 11 of thla year, en deavoring to come to an International agreement for tho preservation and sat isfactory uae of the flatteries of these wa ter which can not otherwlae be achieved. I,ake Krle. for example, haa the richest fresh water fisheries In th world: but It la now controlled by tha atalutea of two natlona, four atatea, and on province, and thla province by two different ordi nance In different counties. All thess political dlvlalona work at cross pur poses, and In no rasa ran they achieve protection to the flsheiie. on the one hand, and Justice to the localities and In- dividual on th other. Foreign Affair. Thla natlon'a foreign policy la baaed on the theory that right muat ba done between natlona preclaely aa between Individual, and In our actlona for the last tan yeara we have In thla matter proven our faith by our deeda. We have behaved, and are behaving, to wards other natlona, aa In private Ufa an honorable man would behave to wards hla fellows. Latin-American Republics. The commercial and material prog ress of the 0 I,atln-Amerlcan republloa la worthy of tha careful attention of the congreaa. The International Bureau of the American Republlca la doing uaeful work In making theae natlona and their resource better known to ua, and In acquainting tham not only with ua aa a people and with our pur poae towarda them, but with what we have to exchange for their good. Panama Canal. The work on the Panama canal Is be ing done with a speed, efficiency and entire devotion to duty, which mske It a model for all work of the kind. The men on the Iathmua, from Col. Goethale and hla fetlow commlaaloners through the entire list of employee who are faithfully doing their duty, have won their right to the ungrudging respect and gratitude ot the American people. Ocean Mall Llnee. I again recommend the estenalon of tha ocean mall act or litl ao that satla- factory American ocean mall llnea to South America, Asia, the Philippine, and Auatralaaia may ba established. Hawaii. I call particular attention to the Ter ritory of Hawaii. Tha Importanoe of thoae laianda la apparent, and the need of improving their condition and de veloping their resources la urgant. The Philippines. Real progress toward self-government la being made In ths Philippine Islands. I trust that within a generation the time will arrive whan the PhlUppioae sea Oecl&e tor vheaaaolres whetfe tt la well for them to become Independent, of. to continue tinder the protection of a' atrong and disinterested power, able to guarantee to the laianda order at horn and protection from foreign Invasion Porte Rloo. I again recommend that American clt lxenship be conferred upon the people of Porto Rloo, Cuba. In Cuba our occupancy will cease In about two montha time; the Cubans have In orderly manner elected their own governmental authorities, and the laland will be turned over to them. Our occu pation on thla occasion haa lasted a lit tle over two year, end Cuba haa thriv en and pro pared under It. Our earnest hops and one desire is that the people of the Island ahall now govern them selves with Justice, so that peace and or der may be aeeure. Japanese Exposition. The Japanese government haa post poned until 1117 th date of the great International exposition, the action be ing taken ao aa to Insure ample time In which to prepare to make the expo sition all that It ahould ba made. The American commissioner have visited Japan and the postponement will mere ly give ampler opportunity for Ameri ca to ba represented at the exposition. Not alnce the tirat International expo altloa haa there been one of greater Importance than thla will be, marking, aa It does, the fiftieth anniversary of tha ascension to the throne of tha em peror of Japan. Tha extraordinary leap to th foremost place among the nation nf tha world made by Japan during this half century la something unparalleled In all previous history. I take thla opportunity publicly to alnto my appreciation of the way In which In Japan, In Australia, In New Zealand, and In all the slates of flouth America, the buttle fleet haa been re ceived on It prnctice voyage around the world. Tho American government can not too strongly express It appre ciation nf the abounding and generous hospitality shown our ships In every port they visited. The Army. Aa regarda the army I call attention to the fact that while our Junior off) cera and enlisted men Bland very high, tho present aystem of promotion by seniority results In bringing Into the higher grade many men nf mediocre capacity who have but a ahort time to serve. No man ahould rrgnrd It as hla vested right to rise to the highest rank In the army any more than In any other profession. It la a curious and by no mean creditable fact that there should be ao often a failure on the part of the publlo and Ita representa tive to understand the great need, from the standpoint of the service and the nation, nf refusing to promote re spectable, eldorly Incompetents. The higher plnrea should be given to the most deserving men without regard to seniority; at least seniority should be treated a only one consideration. In tho stress of modern Industrial com petition no business firm could succeed If those responsible for It management were chosen simply on the ground that they were the oldest people In Ita em ployment; yet thla la the course advo cated a regards the army, and re quired by law for all grades except those of general offlcor. Aa a matter of fact all nf the beat officers In the highest ranka of the army are those who have attained their present posi tion wholly or In part by a process of selection. The scope of retiring boards should be extended an that they could con alder general unfitness to command for any cause. In order to secure a far mora rigid enforcement than at present In the elimination of officers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities. Hut thla plan la recommended only If the congress dnea not aoe tit to provlda what In my Judgment la far better. that I, for selection In promotion, and for elimination for age. Officers who fall to attain a certain rank by a cer tain age, ahould ba retired for In stance, If a man ahnuld not attain field rank by the time he la 46 he ahould of course be placed on the re tired Hat. General officer ahould ba aelected aa at preaent, and one-third of the other promotions ahnuld be made by selection, the selection to ba mad by the president or ecretary ot war from a list of at least two candi dates proposed for each vacancy by a board of officers rrom the arm of the service from which the' promotion la to ba made. A bill la now before tha ' congreaa having for Ita object to se cure the promotion of officers to vari ous gradea at reaaonable agea through a process of selection, by boards of of ficers, of th leaat emcieni tor retire ment with a percentage of their pay depending upon length of aervlca. The hill, although not accomplishing all that ahould ba done, la a long atep In tha right direction: and I earnestly recommend Ita passage, or that of a more completely effective measure. National Guard. Now that the nrgnnlxed militia, the National Ouard. haa been Incorporated with the army aa a part of tha national forcsa. It bahoovea the government to do every reaaonable thing In ita power to perfect Ita efficiency. It ahould be aaalated In Ita Inatructlon and other wlae aided more liberally than hereto fore. Tho contlnuoua aervlcea ot many well-trained regular officer will be eaacntlal In thla connection. A bill la now pending before th congreaa creating a number of extra officers In the army, which If passed, aa It ought to he, will enable more officers to be trained aa tnatructora ot National Guard and assigned to that duty. In caaa of war It will be of the utmoat Importance to have a large number of trained offlcera to uae for turning raw levlea Into good troop. The Navy. I approve the recommendations of the general board for the in creaae ot the navy, calling especial attention to the need of addi tional deatroyers and collier, and above all, of the four battleships. It la desir able to complete aa soon as possible a squadron of eight battleahlpa ot the best sxistlng type. I most earneatly recommend that ths general board be by law turned Into a general staff. Ther Is literally no ex cuse whatever for continuing tha pres ent bureau organisation of tha navy. The navy ahould be treated aa a purely mili tary organisation, and everything ahould be aubordlnated to th ona object of se curing military efficiency. A system of promotion by merit, either by selec tion or by exclusion, or by both processes, ahould be Introduced. It Is out of the queatlon. If the present principle ot promotion by mere aenloiity Is kept, to expect to get the best results from th higher officers. Our men come too old. and atay for too ahort a time. In the high command positions. Nothing batter for the navy from every standpoint haa ever occurred than th cruise of tb battle fleet around th world. Th Improvement of tha ablpa la every way haa been extraordinary, and thay have gained far more experience In battle tactics than they would have gained If they had atayed In the Atlantlo waters. The American people have cauae for profound gratification, both In view of the excellent condition of the fleet as shown by this cruise, end la view of th Improvement the cruise haa worked la thla already high condition. I do not believe that there Is any other aervlce la the world In which the average ot char acter and efficiency In the enlisted mea la aa blfh aa I now tha case In our own. THKODORhl. ItOOSKVKXT.
