POLITICAL SCHEME? Gossip About the Conilnjr Conference of Xrcrom nt Detroit. . DETROIT, Dec. 3. The local committee in charge of the arrangements for the na tional conference of colored men In this city. Dee. 12 and 13. announces that the railways have granted a ooe-and-a-thlrd round-trip rate for the convention from all points. According to pre.nt Indications, political considerations seem destined to cut some figure among delegates in spite of efforts to the contrary. Local Republican colored men claim that there will be no politics in the discussions unless the Democratic dele gates who may be present precipitate such issues, and the Democrats di?avov any such intentions. The early appearance upon the field of J. A. Ross, of Davenport, a lead ing ntro Democrat, has, a;j.jrJln ;o cer tain local leaders, given rise if; i.?pic urs among the Republicans that the Democrats have designs for controlling th? J-dcgaies. J. Monroe Johnson, colored Editor of the Detroit Republican, said, this evening: "While it is the desire of the representa tive colored men of the country that the conference shall be a nonpartisan one, y: we are thoroughly convinced that the ac tion of Mr. Itoea, a stanch Democrat, who Is already on the field arranging to banquet tho delegates, looks as though the Democ racy, thtough its colored agent, Aould like to capture the convention." D. Augustus Straker, who is considered the leading colored man of Dttrolt. says that, rs he understands It, there is no poli tics whatever in the movement for the con ference. Says Cleveland In Wrong, 

DENVER. Col., Dec. 5.-Hon. C. S. Thomas, national Democratic committee man from Colorado, expressed his opinion regarding the President's message to-day as follows: "On foreign affairs the Presi dent is democratic, and therefore right. His attitude Is that of the vast body of his countrymen. On financial afTalrs he is con sistent with his past, but so radically and viciously wrong that none save the Wall street Interests can regard it otherwise than as the expression of an obstinate man whoe theory Is that he must be right, and, therefore, everybody else must be wrong. His party platform and tra.dl tlons are thrown overboard, and the ultra radicalism of the Sherman rchool of finance is unconditionally approved and recom mended. He may succeed in securing Its adoption, but only through the destruction or trie Democratic party' WAR IS 

THREATENED CAX DC AVERTED OXL.Y BY THE BACKDOWX OF HXGLAD. The Venezuelan Dispute Reported by a Correspondent to Have Reaehed a. Crisis Salisbury's ote. CHICAGO, Dec. 5. A special dispatch to the Times-Herald from its Washington cor respondent says: War between the United Statea and Great Britain is threatened, it can be averted only by surren der, on the part of England. The contention over, the Monroe doctrine has reached a stage which will produce the gravest anxiety on both sides of the At lantic until the facts become known. If the American Congress will support the Presi dent, and of this there can be no doubt, Great Britain will soon ba given the choice of surrendering or fight ing. Upon authority which cannot be questioned, reads the dispatch, tt is known that Ihls government has re ceived a cablegram from Embassador Bay ard giving briefly the contents of the note which tho Marquis of Salisbury has mailed In reply to Secretary Olney's dispatch of last July. This reply is, in substance, a refusal to arbitrate any of the territory eastward of the Schomburg line. Moreover, Lord Salisbury raises a new case. He now contends that tho Schomburg line was not arbitrarily run; thatUt was, In fact, located on authentic data, and that it can be proved by the records, the treaty de scriptions and the maps that it correctly represents the western limits of the terri tory which Great Britain acquired by ces sion from Holland. Receipt of this information caused some excitment in the Washington government. Secretary Olney at once proceeded to con fer with the President about it. They agreed in their opinion concerning it, and this opinion was that the British Premier was trifling with the merits of the ques tion; that he was attempting to evade and delay direct response to the principal issue involved, and to bring on a controversy be tween the two governments as to historical records and topographical facts. Such a controversy, the President and Secretary agreed, if once entered upon might run an indefinite length. The programme which the President and the Secretary now have In mind is first to ascertain the wishes of Venezuela in the premises. If Venezuela is willing to arbi trate on the Schomburg line, then the mis sion of the United States is, for the time being, at an end. Venezuela has repeatedly refused this, and It is not expected that she will give in now. Once being assured of Venezuela's unwillingness to submit to Eng land's pretension, the President will refer the the whole matter to Congress at an early day for such action as that body may see fit to take. The correspondence will be accom panied by a message from the President explaining the situation, but probably con taining no recommendations. Congress, as the only war-making power, will be left to its own determination, uninfluenced save by facts. Whwi th!s moment arrives the ex ecutive will have exhausted his resources. The future course of the contention will rest with tho nation legislature. It Is expected, however, that Congress will at onee authorize the President to issue an ultimatum that will cause England to back down or fight. . 

DISPUTE OVER A BALL PLAYER. President Tlrnsh Wanted Doyle, but Did Not Get Htm. NEW YORK. Dec. 5. The World says: President John T. Brush, of the Cincinnati baseball club, has filed an affidavit with President Young, of the National League, to the effect tha President Freedman, of the New York baseball club, had given the Cincinnati club an option on the services of Jack Doyle, and had then ruthlessly broken the agreement in order to make a trade with the Baltimore club for "Kid" Gleason. This Is bringing up again a warm incident of the recent meeting of magnates. Mr. Freedman was very anxious to secure Artie Latham for the New York team. He Im portuned Mr. Brush to close the deal, but the Cincinnati magnate declared that he liked the third baseman too well to let him go. He continually asked for further time. Shortly after, however, the Baltimore club came to Sir. Freedman with the offer , of "Kid" Gleason for Doyle, and the trade Instantly closed, as Mr. Freedman in no way considered himself bound to Mr. Brush. It was not long after these negotiations had closed that Mr. Brush told Mr. Freedman he would give up Latham. Whereupon he was told by Mr. Freedman that he was too late, because he had already secured Glea son. "But you gave me an option until to morrow morning." said Mr. Brush. "I did not do anything of the kind," re sponded Mr. Freedman. Mr. Brush has since traded Latham to St. Louis, and Just what he means by his communication to President Young at this late day is not quite clear. Better Stick to Theatricals.

Herr Ahlwardt says he came over on the solicitation of some New York and Mil waukee men and expects to give five lec tures In New York. It is said that Herr Ahlwardt's mission to America is to start a campaign against the Hebrews, his doctrine being that they are encroaching on the wealth of the world, and are a menace to the prosperity of other races of the earth. He does not believe they should hold office, enjoy the rights of citizenship or have any share in public affairs. In an interview Dr. Ahlwardt said: "I have cone to America for the purpose of exposing the methods of Jews. An anti Semitic club in New York -invited me to deliver a series of lectures here. I am at. the head of the anti-Semitic movement abroad and am the leader1 of the anti Semitic faction in the Reichstag.' In 1870 I became an anti-Semitic. Prof. Duerlng, of tho University of Berlin, interested me in work against the Jews. He wTas the leader of the movement at that time. I studied the sub ject and followed in his footsteps. He preached the doctrine of anti-semltlclsm. I recognized its truth and its value. At that time I was rector of the public schools in Berlin and came In contact dally with the poorer element. I saw what they suf fered at the hands of the Semitics, I rec ognized the wrong done the working classes and became a worker in the movement. For four years I have been in the Reichs tag and have advocated every measure against the Hebrews. Not long ago I re ceived the invitation to lecture here. I saw the field was great and determined to come at once.. Just where the lectures should be delivered I cannot say at the present moment. I must consult the club's president before I divu'.re the plans. This nuch I can say, the lectures will be given In New York, Chicago. Milwaukee, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Buffalo and perhaps in other cities later." 

CHINESE C0XSP1RAT0RS. Plot to Cnptnre the City of Canton Fruntrated hy the Authorities. BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 3. Mall advices re ceived by reliable persons In this city from Canton. China, to-day, give details of an. attempt to capture the city of Canton by a secret organization for the purpose of es tablishing an Independent government. The writer says: "The plot ripened Oct. 27, when the attention of the United States consul was called to a suspicious telegram from a Hong Kong firm to Its branch in Canton, concerning the shipment of certain pack ages. The authorities were notlfled. and the packages, which proved to be five barrels of pistols and ammunition, labeled "cement," were seized on their arrival. On the same steamer from Hong Kong came four hun dred men, who expected to aid in the re volt. The officials, however, captured seventy-five of them. The revolutionists had no weapons, but it was learned that they were to be supplied by friends in the city. This seizure of arms and the capture of those implicated thwarted the attempt, and the authorities are now making alligent search for the leader as well as for more weapons. It is said there are thousands in sympathy with the movement. The Hong Kong papers speak of it as a "patriotic movement," and worthy of, support. The plan of the organization,- which orig inated In Hong Kong and was taken up in Canton, was first to capture the city treas ury and next to demolish the viceroy's pal ace. By this time they would expect suf ficient aid to storm the city. They next ex pected to proclaim an Independent govern ment and to take measures to hold the city. The movement has involved the Christians to a considerable extent, and ereat excite ment prevails, especially inside the city near a cnapei. wnicn nad been used.unknown to the missionaries, as a sort of rendezvous for some of the conspirators. German Anxlou to Control Samoa. LONDON, Dee. 5. The Berlin correspond ent of the Times telegraphs to that paper a suggestion that Germany's anxiety to se cure sole control In Samoa may stimulate her desire to avoid a tariff war with Amer ica, The correspondent adds: "The tone of the more responsible newspapers with ref erence to President Cleveland's complaint of German restrictions on American food products and American insurance compa nies is significantly moderate and concilia tory, and, although the American griev ances are regarded as ill-founded, there is little disposition to resent the form in which the President utters them."

IMMIGRANTS WITH SMALLPOX. Allejred Faulty Inspection of Steerage Pirngrri nt Aevr York. NEW YORK, Dec. 5. A dispatch received In this city from Braddock, Pa., says that three 'cases of smallpox have been found there. The Braddock authorities were sus picious of three Immigrants in a party of seven Germans who arrived there last Sun day, having been landed in this city by the steamship Kaiser Wilhelm II on Saturday. Dr. Benjaminj Lee, secretary of the Penn sylvania Board of Health, was conferred with. The patients are now unler surveil lance. The . four other Germans are be lieved to have the same disease. Health Officer Doty said to-night that he could not understand how there could have been any smallpox on the Kaiser Wilhelm II. "A thorough Inspection of the vessel was made." Dr. Doty said, "and there was not a trace of the disease. A second inspec tion of the passengers was made at Ellis island. Dr. Lee must either have Improp erly diagnosed the disease, or. If it is smallpox, it developed after the passengers had been passed at quarantine. My officers at Bremen and at Southampton have not informed me of smallpox at either place. I will make an investigation to-morrow." A "DEAD TOUGH" BALL OXD OF THE SORT WHICH 31 R. POW ELL WOULD XEVER TOLERATE. Notorious Violation of the Liquor Law at Mozart Hall Lout lght A Ilowery Affair. ' The "Mededicks and De Foutos Club" gave a ball at Mozart Hall last night. The event was typically a Bowery dance in its character. It is safe to say that no more disgraceful event was ever given In th hall. Although the hall is within a stone's throw of the police station the affair was allowed to proceed without police Inter ference. The 11 o'clock law was openly and notoriously violated almost -In the very face of the police. Gamblers In loud Jewelry and ample shirt fronts were there with painted women of the town. Young girl in shabby finery went through the waltx la the embrace of the "levee tough." The bar was open from the time the hall opened until after 1 o'clock. At midnight the scene in the barroom was strikingly characteris tic of such places as permitted under the . present city administration. Thre waiters were kept busy waiting on the crowd that pushed and shoved against ths bar. Men and women stood side and sid and tossed off glass after glass of liquor between ribald jests and disgusting songs and laughter. The strains of the "Sun shine of Paradise Alley" floated into ths barroom from the stage, but were lost in the din of rattling beer glasses. The men jostled the women tbout and indulged lu coarse slang. One man stood in the door way leading to the bar with his arm about a woman's waist. She made no objection to the caress, and the scene furnished amusement tor the crowd. Once a flashily dressed woman pushed through the crowd and made her way to the bar. She was decked out in gorgeous finery that attract ed more than ordinary attention. "Who is she.'" atted one young fellow of another. "Oh, don't you know her? She's down at So-and-So's." naming the keeper of a dis reputable resort, whose place was closed up by ex-Superintendent Powell. But it is run ning again under the new administration, and its Inmates graced the dance last night. At no time before 12 o'clock did the police put in an appearance. The sounds of riot ous revelry could be plainly heard in the street below, but the noise did not reach the ears of these guardians of the peace. About midnight one gentleman, who ap peared to have something to do with the affair, remarked that the indications pointed to a "rough house" before long. This timely tip had the effect of clearing the hall of a few people who had no relish for the approaching entertainment. Be tween 12 and 1 o'clock a policeman with a large, shining badge and a timid air walked into the hall. He took a hasty, uneasy sur vey of the place and found it convenient to hide himself in the crowd. About this time Homebody started a fight on the floor, and several gentlemen indulged in a rough and tumble "knockabout." The policeman was fortunate enough to keep out of harm's way, and wasn't hurt. The programme of dances set out some choice attractions. One was the "Hootche Kootche" minuet, which proved delectable entertainment for those who were sober enough to enjoy its vir tues. Another event was a schottlsche "with the Queen of the. Mededicks." This excellent lady, however, was not in evi dence, to the intense disappointment of her admirers. The concluding waltz, the pro gramme eaid, was "Oh, What a Night. Look Out for the Next One, Daddos." At the top of the programme, the name of "Reuben Glue" was announced as prompter of the music. , The fact that there was no police Inter ference last night will doubtless encourage the "Mededicks" to attempt something more daring next time.
