"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm V,5jl ir"'"" i-- &gl MAKPHAT.Ti SI. 51UKDOCK. Kdltor. The anti-Resubmission Republican papers are running an idiotic screed un der the head "Prentis Talks." Suppos ing he does, -what did any talk he ever made amount to, politically, in this state? An exchange furnishes the following useful catalogue of the current Ken tucky feuds: The Hatfield-McCoy, the Sowders-Turner, the French-Eversole, the -Howard-Lewis, the Mullins-Taylor and the Brumfield-Runyon, Of course the list does not pretend to be complete. Only those feuds which have acquired great notoriety are mentioned. More stoves are manufactured in De troit than any other city in the United States. There are three large manufac tories there that do an enormous and profitable business. It is so profitable, in fact, that English capitalists have eyed it with envious eyes, and are pre paring to gobble up all these concerns. If they succeed, their purchase will give them a commanding influence in the market. Some curious specimens of literature have been received by Mayor Grant of New York, in regard to the ordinance licensing organ grinders to play in the streets. One man wants them refused this privilege unless they agree to play "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" and "Hail Columbia" at in tervals. This correspondent of the mayor must be an anarchist, otherwise he would not want to make our national anthems odious. As between the demands of the wool manutacturers of tlv east for free wool, and the demands of the wool producers of the west for a protective tariff on wool, the congress will find itself in tp predicament described by Senator Ingalis' in characterizing his attitude on the prohibition question in Kansas. The same may be true touch ing the silver question as be tween the east and west. As to the out come we shall see what wo shall see. Among the expert expressions elicited by last Saturday's electric calamity in Boston, one of the most striking is the statement of Harold P. Brown, of New York, that by the substitution of copper wires for others now in use, the electrical business of the city can be conducted without danger or alteration in the na ture of the supply to consumers. If such a change will prevent danger from electrie lighting and power, it certainly should be enforced by law and regula tion. The Wellington Press in attempting to give the animus (?) of the Resubmis sion movement and the status of the Eagle touching that question, very plainly shows that its editor either does not know what ho is talking about or that he is intentionally putting the Eagle in a false position before his readers. As for ibo Press' intimation that "Wichita don't amount to much in the state of Kansas, there is one thing very certain and that is, "Wichita is the bigeest thing ever pro duced by Kansas on Kansas soil. Count Schovaloff, tho Russian minis ter at Berlin, at a banquet given to Minister Phelps, 6aid the United States was the only country in the world that wanted nothing and feared nothing. In a general way, and as applied to the country as a whole the observation is correct; but there are some portions of the country that seem to want a good deal, and some people wo wot of stand in constant mortal dread of something that they believe is coming yet haven't the courage to acknowledge it and act accordingly. In politics bluff rarely wins. In a cer tain game of cards known as poker, it is baid, that trick wins occasionally, but in politics very seldom indeed. He who at tempts it Is not as sagacious as ho should be. Atchison Champion. What kind of a game would you call this, when both United States senators, all the congressmen except one, all the state officers and eight-tenths of all the Republican papers in the state all get up tit once and all declare that there is really no demand worth noticing being made by the people of the state for re submission? Wo are not acquainted with the gamo known as poker, but the above strikes us as not only quite bluffy but rocky, and on that we stand pat. The mayor of Atchison lias presumed to call upon the metropolitan police au thorities to account to the city authori ties proper for the monies received up to the present time but withheld from the city, and as far as the mayor knows re main unaccounted for to any authority; but the m. p. a's throw themselves back with a "don't have to"' air, imperiously refuse and as impertinently ask "What are you going to do about it?" It is the mayor's say. Meantime the $1S,000 shortage of funds necessary to square the city's accounts for current expenses grows bigger day by day. The terrible accident to Emin Pasha, mentioned in yesterday's dispatches, mars the pleasurable interest excited in Stanley's graphic description of his trav els and discoveries in central Africa. Much of the very interesting and valu able information belongs to Emiu's credit, and it is too bad that so serious a mishap should befall him and in a man ner so ignominious in comparison with the thrilling incidents that have attended him day and night for the past five years. The universal wish is that he may survive his injuries, even if he should persist in his refusal to leave the country and peo plo for whom he has formed so strong an attachment. One of the most interesting features of Secretary Tracy's report is the discus sion of the use of merchant vessels as war cruisers and the advisability of the construction of a class of commercial vessels readily convertible to war uses. In connection with this subject Mr. Tracy makes one recommendation that will be generally approved. It is that the department be authorized to furnish to states maintaining naval militia, old vessels to be employed as gunnery and training schools. There is, the secretary contends, even greater necessity for a naval than for a land militia, on account of the special training requisite to ren der a sea force efficient in an emergency,, gaittjT 

PBBACHERS OR POLICEMEN, WHICH? Tobacco Is as much a necessary ol life as coffee Is: ne!th:rono is essentia", but both are regarded as necessaries by those who use them, and both aro extensively used. The laborer, the mechanic, the farmer and men of every other occupation regularly lay out a portion ot their earnings in tobacco. Just as thoy do coCee. Therefore, a tax which Increases tuo cost or tobacco to the consumer Is almost a di rect tax upon the people, and a repeal of such a tax would be a direct relief to them. President Harri son's recommendation for a repeal of the tobacco lax is wise and patriotic. The revenue is notneeded and should not be collected. It is no more right to keep a tax on tobacco than it would bo to impose a tax on coffee or tea. Emporia Republican. Hold on there Mr. Anti-Resubmission-Pro-Constitutional-Convention cham pion. A prominent member of the Pro hibition party announced to us, but the other day, that in Kansas the next thing that must go was your tobacco, that nasty, health-destroying weed, which is consuming the hard earnings of almost every laborer in the land. Why should men be permitted to use the vile growth at the expense of wives and children who do not use it? The man who de clared this was not a day laborer, but a minister, and when he asked us why the use of tobacco should not be prohibited by law, we could only answer that if the theory of prohibition is sound and right there is no reason why everything deleterious to health, or obnoxious to the neighbor, to the wife or to the child, should not be prohibited. For that matter the government of Russia as have other governments in the moral interest of her subjects, not only enforces the strongest kind of prohibitory laws but makes religion obligatory and com pels worship. Still, somehow, or in some way, the sneaking notion has in the course of years been instilled into the average American breast, that this is a conntry of moral and religious liberty. This foolish notion has been so persistently cherished and so long and so complacently winked at by those whom we are forced to elect to govern us, that the people had got an idea that, without reference to age, sex or previous condi tion of servitude, personal liberty was a kind of right inhering on this side of the ocean, that it was a birthright peroga tivo of every child who on American soil first opened its eyes to the light of day. But again, dear old man, Eskridjre, and before you are compelled to give up your tobacco, wherefore education, if law is equal to all immorality? and -therefore, wherefore preachers and churches if man can be legally forced to worship God acceptably? Just think, dear governor, of the stom achs in this dyspepsia-ridden land,of the horrors by day and the nightmares of agony by night, for which tobacco and coffee and deleterious pies and cakes are alone responsible; and then our grave yards filled with youths, instead of rip ened age. Governor, all these and many other abuses coming from the depraved human passions and appetites must, or ought to go. If the police commission can do away with them more rapidly and surely than moral training and religious education; if Mur ray laws are more effective than the pul pit and the rostrum, why, then, in the name of humanity, cease preaching and teaching and double the police force. Finally, dear governor, some, aye a great number, in fact, and the Eagle is among them, still desire to cling to that delusion, if it be a delusion, the preacher and the pulpit, the teacher and the ros trum and all those moral, mental and spiritual forces and elevating influences which stand for self-conscious respect and for appealing to true manhood and womanhood rather than for an aggrega tion of people brought to bay by a police commission. or vilely cringing beneath the menaco of the policeman's club. 

PRETTY MUCH BOSH. The Kansas papers are congratulating Kansas and the administration on the fact that Kansas has at last been equit ably recognized and in full by President Harrison, first in the ministership to Mexico, next in the appointment of Judge Brewer to the supreme bench. Let us see: Tom Ryan had a good posi tion, a big place, and was simply given a better one. Judge Brewer had a life position and was only promoted to an other life position. Nobody in Kansas has been rewarded that did not already hold a reward equal to his claims on the party. Brewer as circuit judge was far more important to the people of his state than he can bo to them on the su preme bench of the United States. Kan sas will now lose tho district judgeship for Minnesota, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Arkansas. 

STILL ANOTHER. The State Chicken and Pet association have been holding their annual exhibi tion in Wichita this week, as also have the Swine 'Breeders' association. But thero is another yet for this month. The Southern Kansas Farmers' associa tion hold a meeting at Wichita on De cember 17, IS, 19. The association will bo welcomed by Mayor Clement, of Wichita. A paper on the "Chinch Bug" will be read by Prof. Snow, followed by a general discussion on bugs and wheat growing. Addresses will bo made by Hon. F. E. Gillett and Hon. Tom Mc Neal. "The Horse" will be talked about by John T. Hessel, Col. B. H. Campbell and Prof. Phillips. An address will be made by Col. John W. Forney, and ex tended remarks on swine by Col. M. Stewart and Col. John Whitaker, of packing house fame. Prof. Cowgill will talk on sugar and L. F. Sherwood on cel ery: Gov. Humphrey, ex-Gov. Anthony and Hon. A. AV. Smith will bo present and make addresses. 

GONE TO JOIN HIS IDOL. Tho death of Jefferson Davis will cause a universal sigh to escape the hearts of the southern people, but it will be in the main and in a large measure a sigh of relief for, while he has been held in all but reverential esteem by the older portion of the community, being the recognized leader of the lost cause, his personal presence constituted a sort of connecting. link binding the dead past to the would-be lively aud progressive present, a condition they fain would have been rid of these many years. In some respects Mr. Davis was a remarka ble man. That he was a man of ability no one familiar with the history of this country will deny, else he could never havo attained to the distinction he did among his fellow-countrymen nor held the respect and confidence of his con freres. But with all his ability he was never able to overcome his bitter dis loyalty to the Union nor the infatuation that somehow the lost cause should finally prevail. But he has gone into that eternity that envelops alike the leader and tho cause. The consolidation of the two great bodies, the Knights of Labor and the Farmers and Laborers' union, represent ing in the main the labor interests of the country, into one grand alliance con stitutes the largest organization in the world, embracing something like 4,000, 000 voters. The management of the af fairs of so stupendous a body so as to conserve the interests of all and prevent conflicts will require the wisest counsel. Our prediction is that if it essays a voy age upon the political seas it will soon founder upon some one of the many hidden rocks therein. As a compromise and to break the dead lock in the Montana legislature over the election of United States sena tors it is suggested that each party take one senator. A protest from this dis tance would do no good, but it strikes us that such an arrangement as that would be a compromise that the Republicans cannot afford to make. They are en titled to both the senators or neither. If the former they should contend for it to the last as a matter of right; if tho lat ter, they should put an end to the con test by permitting those entitled to the positions to have them. Aside from the question of principle and right the Re publicans do not require one nor both the Montana senators to maintain a good working majority in that body. The Republican party can always afford to be just. It is the only policy that pays in the end. If Senator Ingalis' world's fair bill, in troduced in tho senate Thursday, may be taken as an indication of what con gress will do in the way of providingi f unds for the great event, it may also be considered as a good big straw indi cating where it will be located. The ex penditure of $8,000,000 by the govern ment for grounds and permanent im provements, with no reference to a re imbursement of the amount expended from any source, is, wo take it, a pretty strong circumstance in Washington City's favor for the location. Such grounds and buildings could be used to good advantage by the government after the great show is over, if contigu ous to tho national capital, but not so anywhere else. However, local pro vision for all these expenses and the fur ther consideration of convenience to the people of the greatest area of this coun try may successfully supplant the initial move referred to, in which event St. Louis' chances are still second to no other. THE POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT. Anent the annual reports of the depart ments of the government at Washington now being submitted through the presi dent to congress for its consideration and for the information of the people, that of the postoffice department is not second in interest to any of the others. Of this most intricate portion of the ma chinery of government tho dead letter office is perhaps tho most striking and interesting feature. This is the place to which all misdirected, missent, illegibly addressed, tin mailable and unpaid letters ami packages are sent. In former years all such matter was almost literally dead, for scarcely any effort was made to restore it either to tho addressee or the sender, and most of it was perma nently lost. Now every effort is used to traee tho matter, and most of it either finds its proper destination or is restored to tho sender. The statistics of tho office show the extent of its operations. Tho report of the superintendent shows tho following: During tho year ended June 30. 1SS9, 0,206.493 pieces of oricinal dead mail mat ter were received. Of these, 4,050,986 were ordinary unclaimed letters, 1G7.120 were returned from hotels, 23,701 were fictitious addresses, and 180,491 were returned as un dellverable from foreign countries. Of the unmailablo there were 109,803 "held for postage," 453,421 misdirected or in sufficiently addressed, 19.6S4 without any address, and G,876 miscellaneous, 534.S02 letters and parcels of foreign origin. 70,03S parcels of third and fourth class matter, and 22,316 registered articles. There were 08,034 letters returned to the card address unopened; C,7S3 "held for postnge" for warded to the addresses; 90,105 misdi rected letters, upon which the addresses were corrected and letters forwarded. Of the matter opened 21,071 contained money amounting to $34,830; 24,075 contained negotiable paper amounting to $1,497,2S2. face value; 3,417 contained postal notes amounting to $5,320, 37,309 contained books and articles of merchandise; 40,349 contained miscellaneous papers; 40,759 con tained photographs, and 127,72i contained postage stamps. There were restored to owners 14.704 money letters, containing $25,6GG; 22,873 letters containing negotiable paper amounting to $1,415,803; 3,114 letters containing postal notes amounting to 4.698; y, i5 letters containing merchan dise articles; 30,207 containing miscellan eous papers; 32,410 containing photographs, and 120,552 containing postage stamps. These figures bhow a volume of busi ness which keeps a large force of clerks constantly busy. Tho average number of pieces, letters and parcels received at the dead letter office is over 17.000 per day, aud the average from day to day does not vary much from that number. A singular thing is that the number of letters mailed without being stamped, the number of misdirected letters, etc., each maintain a very even average throughout the year. Perhaps you never mailed a letter without haying affixed a stamp; perhaps you do not per sonally know of any person doing it; yet not a day passes without several scores, if not hundreds of letters are dropped in the mails without being stamped. Among the ingenious devices to assist in tracing misdirected letters is a street directory, containing in alphabetical or der the names of every 6treet. avenue, court and alley in every city in the United States. If the name is duplicated or used in several cities the name of each city is given. Suppose a letter is addressed to number , Meridian street, Minneapolis, Minn. There being no such street in that city, it goes to the dead letter ofKce. There the street di rectory shows there is a Wichita street in Wichita, Kan., and the letter is sent here. If the name of the street should happen to be Washington, or some common name, used in dozens of cities, each one is tried in turn until tiie right Washington street is found. The packages and narcels which reach the dead letter office contain an endless variety of matter, all sorts of merchan dise, Yankee notions, fancy works, pho tographs, samples, jewelry, botanical specimens, minerals, garments of all kinds, live snakes, horned toades, etc These articles accumulate rapidly, and at regular intervals are catalogued and sold at auction, and the proceeds turned into the treasury. Last year the sum of ?9,44? in money, for which no owner could be found, was turned into the treasury, and the packages sold at auc tion realized 2.603. SUNFLOWER SHADOWINGS. Seeds, Slips, Scions, Sprouts, Shoots and Slivers. It is not wise to lie for the sake of wit. Senator Ingalis on President Harrison's message: "Harrison is making Hayes ap pear respectable." It is surprising how many men will see something out of the window when a lady enters a crowded street car. Eleven hundred empty cars left St. Louis on the Missouri Pacific last week to help the Kansas grain shippers out. A great many good people in Kansas are waiting anxiously to find out whether Stanley saw Rider Haggard's "She." Atchison Globe: The man who would be a hero in the small boy's eyes should make candy cigars so that they will have a spit to them. Most of the people who claim they have read the president's message clear through, aro like those who ayer they never slept a wink all night they lie. Wherever Mr. Barnum and his great show go they are bound to be heard of in the newspapers. The London reporters were given a taste of real life. Encountering a foot pad is by no means a pleasant experience, but men who have lingered to long in the poker room are forced to do it to satisfy their wives. Mr. Pickler, of the pew state of North Dakota, who had a personal deposit of ?G00 with the defaulting cashier. Stetson, is learning the ways of Washington life. The contract will be let this week at the Kansas penitentiary for convict labor for the next fiye years. There are at present 175 convicts at work oa contract labor at 60 cents per day. A little boy was arrested in a Kansas town recently for meddling with the brake of a street car. The law'is a great shield, especially when a complicated affair like a street car brake is threatened with danger. December is the corner of the calendar when she enumerates the list of Christmas presents she has received and that lone some, dreamy, vacant look comes back upon his face and he does not seem to hear. Woman, to tramp "Want something to eat, eh? Well, here's some cold hash." Tramp "But I haven't got anything to eat it with." Woman "Just keep on a little further and you'll find a fork in the road." The Fifth avenue hotel, Topeka, refused to feed the jury in the United States cir cuit court yesterday because they were in charge of n colored bailiff, but the Topeka hotels still havo red table cloths and the pepper sauce bottle. These renorts of Stanley's wonderful penetratiou into the wilds of Africa is said to stimulate the Lawrence college young man to put on his English helmet and with his Liddell and Scot learnedly study the water marks on a sandstone rock. A couple of Atchison lawyers are think ing seriously of "freezing" to the island in the Missouri river opposite Atchison and making an attempt to hold it by the right of discovery. The same island has been bobbing up and down for years, but this is the firs? time it struck the Missouri side, hence it licenses "discovery." Abilene Reflector: Now that Bill Nye is ill and likely to die some of the papers that have advertised his letters as their greatest attractions are calling him a fraud as a humorist. Fraud or not he has wrinkled more faces with laughter than any writer of the past decade. His humor is original and inimitable; it will not die with him. Cimarron Echo: In a small town not far distant a minister closed his sermon the other day with these words: "We would be uleased, moreover, to have the young man who is now standing outside the door come in aud make certain whether she is here or not. That would be a great deal better than opening the door half an inch and exposing the people in the hist row of seats to a draught." An exchange tells of a nice little game that will prove very popular in the minis try: "Clmuging the leopard spots" is the newest scheme in church fairs The min ister htretches a large piece of white cloth across one end of the room. On it is drawn in charcoal a representation of a leopard, with its mouth open aud its tail trailing on the ground. About forty pieces of cir cular black cloth a couple of inches in di ameter are fastened all over tho leopard with pins. 'Can the leopard change his spots:'' says the preacher, repeating the biblical question. It can by a simple pro cess, Euch one in the congregation pnys one dollar and buys a spot until the leop ard resembles a white cals. Thed the game is repeated until everybody, including the leopard, is perfectly satisfied with the re sult. 

OKLAHOMA OUTLINES. Oklahoma City will bore for coal or gas. The most unpopular man in Oklahoma opinions is John Wanamaker, in his posi tion of postmaster general. As much game as is killed m Oklahoma, there are still iome men who have to hunt theirs in the butcher stores. When one Oklahoma paper scoops an other, the other sends a man out to jump somebody's claim. It always proves a good counteraction. Dom Pedro, late of Brazil, has lost his titlo and now is simply Mr. Peter Bra gauza. If he will come to Oklahoma ho will find a well arranged stock of military titles at low figures. The Kiugfishcr school house is now in course of construction and will be a valuable acquisition to the architectural beauties of the city as well as a laudable institution of learning. Oklahoma City Journal: A number of Kicknuoo bucks were in town yesterday trading, and "swapping" aud selling horses. They sold a nice 2-year old filly for $7 and immediately afterwards it was sold for 810, then forSlo and finally for $20. They also traded a number of their ponies. Isn't it pretty risky business buying or trading with an ludiau without the con sent of the agent? Work on the Choctaw road was begun at two points, on the crossing of the 'Frisco seventeen miles southwest of Ft, Smith, and at the crossing of the M., K. & T. at McAlester. Track has been laid east from the 'Frisco crossing far into Arkansas to ward Hot Springs, one of their objective points. Between the 'Frisco and the M K. & T. at McAlester the track laying is about completed, and west from McAles ter six miles of track has been laid, while the grading has been completed for twenty miles further west. The sentiment in favor of commntation in Oklahoma is rapidly gaining. Tho people realize that many of the settlers are in poor condition, financially, to live on and hold their claims until they can raise and sell crops next year, without being able to barrow money on their land; in fact, it will be absolutely impossible for many of them to cultivate their land with out doing so. The extension of the com mutation privizege to Oklahoma will not compel any one to commute; it will work no hardship upon the rich, and it will be the temporal salvation of the poor settlers. Reno City Eagle: A Rock Island plat will be filed at the agency, tomorrow, locating the depot directly west of the end of Main street. The depot building: will be very large, as the division offices are to be located in it, and enormous freight houses are to be erected for the accommo dation of the business of this city, the agency and the fort. The plat calls for a right of way three hundred feet wide anil three thousand feet long at that place, with which the officials say they can do until the can rush through congress a bill granting them a tract of land west of town for the location of their great round houses and shops. "Sunset Manna ton." Encese Ware. I watch thy fine approaching line, that seems to flow like blood-red wine fresh from the vintage of the sun.

In bucolic stanzas. Here he reigns, Prince of grains, And his throne is Kansas. A Diphtheria Specific. The Chicago Times announces to tlfe world that pineapple juice has been found to be a specific for diphtheria. It is said that the negroes of the south have used it for years and rarely lose a case. A couple of prominent Chicago men have tried it in bad cases in their fami lies and it has cured every one. Simply get a ripe pineapple, squeeze out the juice and let tho patient swallow it. Re- Eeat the dose at intervals until the meni rane is all gone. The juice is of so pungent a nature that it will cut out the diphtheritic mucous. The remedy is so simple and easy to take that it is worth trying anyhow. The Peril of Mormonism. From tho St. Paul Globe. The larger part of tho proselytes to the Mormon faith are from the ignorant classes of Europe. If they they can be excluded from the ballot box tho Gentile element will be likely to soon overpower the minions of the political church. The testimony taken during the recent in vestigation leaves no room for doubt that treason the state has its pestiferous nest in the bosom of that church. The fact that polygamy is practiced by many of its chief lights is not the heart of peril. This lies in the absolute dominion of the hierarchy over its dupes. Perjurj and murder are the highest service to the church when its power is at stake. It is because the masses of the Mormons are sincere and fanatically devoted to tho service of the church that they aro dan gerous. Were they dishonest imposters, the system would be far less perilous. When the fangs of the beast can be kept out of the body politic, one of the main elements of evil potency will be gone. An Ex-President on An Ex-Emperor. "I believe," said ex-President Hayes tho other day, referring to the Brazilian revolution, "that Dom Pedro is in heart a republican and fully in favor of repub lican institutions, and that the present change in the political situation in his country is not at all distasteful to him. I well recall that at the centennial cele bration in Philadelphia in 1S7G I sat next to the emperor of Brazil. Just lielore Mr. Eyarts began his speech I was sur prised to see Dom Pedro draw from his pocket a well worn, well creased copy of tho American declaration of independ ence, a facsimile of the original, with the written interlineations and corrections. Said he, turning to me: 'That was given to mo by an American friend over ten years ago, and I've had it as a con stant companion ever since. It's a grand, good document. I've made it a close stud.' While the declaration of inde pendence was being read from the orator's stand, tho Brazilian emperor with bowed head and eyes fixed intently on the well worn document before him, followed the reading word for word. The reading concluded, the venerable emper or, with bowed head, still kept his eyes on the last words of the document before him; then looking up, eyes dimmed and voice betraying emotion, ho remarked: 'A wonderful document; a wonderful document!' To me, as I recall the inci dent, there is pathos in it; there is prophecy m it," remarked Mr. Hayes, as he concluded his story. THE 

FORT WORTH TRANSFER. From the Globe-Democrat. Notwithstanding reports to the con trary, tho negotiations for the transfer of the Denver ic Fort Worth to the control of tho Union Pacific have terminated successful!, and the operation of the road was transferred yesterday to the Union Pacific officials. The formation of the new corporation, to bo called the Union Pacific, Colorado & Gulf, which is to embrace the S00 miles of the Den ver, Texas & Fort Worth, and COO miles of the various auxiliary lines of the Union Pacific in Colorado is about completed except some miner details. The new corporation will stand in tho same relation to the Union Pacific as the Utah Northern & Oregon Short Line. Tho GOO miles of the Union Pacific Colo rado lines have been earning and paying dividends into the treasury of the Union Pacific, and it is expected that the new consolidated stock, for which the Denver & Fort Worth stock and the stock of the Union Pacific Colorado lines are to be exchanged on equal terms, will be on a dividend-paying basi3 within a pear. KANSAS HORTICDLTDRAL SOCIETY. Correspondence State Capit.il.
