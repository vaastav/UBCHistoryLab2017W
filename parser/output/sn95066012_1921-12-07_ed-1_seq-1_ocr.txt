He threw out the suggestion that as a means to avoid the delays and vex ations in Congress Incident to the passage of such a measure it would be a wise plan "to grant more power to the Tariff Commission. He argued that that body could prepare a scientific tariff schedule, but owing to f.';e unsettled condition . of the business world, not only in this coun try but in Europe, heurged that the Executive bo empowered to raise or lower the i tariff schedules . within specified limits to stabilize business arid to avoid injustices. In addition to the tariff recom mendations thoro are three suggest ions of greatest importance to the nation. These are the President's proposals for the control of national strikes and Federal activity lri deal ing -with ihdnatrlal warfare; leading a strong anu to American shipping and creating co-operative and dis tributing agencies for helping the American farmer. The President's, comment on tbo American valuation plan was fol lowed with keen Interest. HiB quali fied approval ot the idea has serious ly endangered its chance of adoption. While Mr. Harding did not discuss In detail tho plan to fund tho foreign war debt, his suggestions that the President bo authorized to go ahead with , negotiations probably will be carried out at 'an early date by Con gress, and l.'iatt mooted subject will be started on the way to a satisfac tory solution. Apilauso frtom both Democrats and Republicans greeted the President's proposal for a constitutional amend ment to end the issue of tax free Fed eral, State and municipal bonds. His recommendation that Congress appropriate liberally for food and seed wheat to be sent to thn starv ing millions in Russia also stirred hH audience to enthusiastic handclap pin. In his address to Congress Presi dent Harding advocated: Early en actment of a permanent but fhxiblo tariff. This, with Increased power for the Tariff Commission, would em aide tho Presideut to proclaim ad ditional duties to meet conditions which Congress may designate. A grant of tuitAorlty to negotiate for tin fundiug and for settlement of defaulted interest on tho war loans to foreign countries.
