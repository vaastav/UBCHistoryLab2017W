Close attention was given to the reading by all the senators. Fojlpwlng Is the text of the mes sage :j fr 1 -V THE 

MESSAGE. To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: The congress assembles Oils year- un der the shadow ot a .great calamity. On the «th of September, President Mc- Klnley was shot by an anarchist while attending the Pan-American Exposition at' Buffalo, and^dled In that city on the 14th of that month. Of the last seven elected presidents, life is the third who has been murdered, and the bare recital of this fact is suffl ©lent to Justify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third assassi nation of an American president, have a peculiarly sinister significance. Both President Lincoln' and President Gar field were killed by assassins of types unfortunately ijot uncommon In his tory President Lincoln falling a victim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war. and President Gar Held to the revengeful vanity of a dis appointed office-seeker. President Me Klnley was killed by an utterly de praved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all govern ments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popular liberty if it Is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal Jaws, and who are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people's saber will as to the tyrannical and irre sponsible despot. Then follows a characteristic eulogy of the martyred president. Continuing, the message reads: When we turn from the man to the nation, the harm done Is so great as to excite oar gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most resolute action. This criminal was a professed warchist, inflamed by the teachings of professed anarchists, and probably also by the reckleBS utterances of thoa* who, on the stump and In the public press, appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy and sullen ha «tr«d. The wind to sowed by the men who preach such doctrines, and they can not escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that is reaped. This applies alike to the deliberate dema gogue, to the exploiter of sensationalism and to the crude and foolish visionary who, for whatever reasoq^apologizea for crime or excites aimless discontent, tha Anarchist. Fcr the anarchist himself, whether he preaches or practices his doctrines, we need not have one particle more concern than for any ordinary murderer. He is not the victim of social or political In justice. There are no wrongs to remedy in his case. The cause of bis criminality ie to be found in his own evil passions .and In the evil conduct of those who tirge him on, not In any failure by othT ers or by the state to do justice to him or his. He Is a malefactor and nothing else. He is In no sense, in no shape or way, a• "product of social conditions," save as a highwayman Is "produced" by the fact that an unarmed man happens to have a purse. It is a travesty upon the great and holy names of liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked hi auch a cause. No man or body of men preaching anarchistio doctrines Should be allowed at large any more than if preaching the murder of some specified private Individual. Anarchistic speeches, writings and meetings are es sentially seditious and treasonable. I earnestly recommend to the congress that in "the exercise of its wise discretion It Should take into consideration the coming to this country of anarchists or persons professing principles hostile to all government and justifying the mur der Of those placed in authority. Such 4*«i»uaaJs as those who not long ago 1! {J* gathered in open meeting to glorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy per petrate a Crime, and the law should en sure their rigorous punishment. They and those like them should be kept out of this country and if found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came and far reaching provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the congress. The federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any nrian who kills or attempts to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law is in line of succession for the presiden cy, while the punishment for an unsuc cessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our institutions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of nations, like p).racy and that form of man stealing known as the slave trade for It is of far blacker in famy than either. It should be so de clared by treaties among all civilized powers. Such treaties would give to the federal government the power of deal ing with the crime. A grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was afforded by the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had Just taken the life of the president. The people would have torn him limb from limb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once Invoked In his behalf. So far from his deed being committed on* behalf of the people against the government, the government was obliged at once to exert its full police power to save him from instant death at the hands of the peo ple. Moreover, hiB deed worked not the slightest dislocation In our government al system, and the danger of a recur rence of such deeds, no matter how great it might grow, would work only in the direction of strengthening and giving harctiiness to the forces of order. No man will ever be restrained from be coming president by any fear as to his personal safety. If .the risk to the pres ident's life became great, it would mean that the office would more and more be filled by men of a spirit which would make them resolute and merciless in dealing with every friend of disorder. This great country will not fall into an archy, ancf if anarchists should ev-.-i bt corae a serious menace to Ita institu tions, they would not merely be stamped out, but would Invove in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrines. The American peope are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled It burns like a consuming flame. Stock Gambling. •••,.- During the ast five years business confidence hag been restored, and the nation is to be congratulated because of its present abounding prosperity. Such prosperity can never be created by law alone, altho it is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. If the hand of the Lord is heavy upon any country, if flood or drought comes, human wisdom Is powerless to avert the calamity. Moreover, no law can guard us against the consequences of our own folly. The men who are idle or credulous, the men who Beek gains not by genuine work with head or hand but by gambling in any form, are always a source of men ace not only to themselves but to others. If the business world loses its head, it loses what legislation can not supply. Fundamentally the welfare of each citi zen, and therefore the welfare of the ag gregate of citizens which makes the na tion, must reBt upon individual thrift and energy, resolution and intelligence. Nothing can take the place of this in dividual capacity but wise legislation and honest intelligent administration can give it the fullest scope, the largest opportunity to work to good effect. Trusts and Millionaires. The tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity during the latiter half of the nineteenth century brings us face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, with very serious so cial problems. The old laws, and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law, were once quite sufficient to regulate the accumulation and dis tribution of wealth. Since the industrial changes which have so enormously in creased the productive power of man kind, they are no longer sufficient. The growth of cities has gone beyond comparison faster than the growth of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial centers has meant a startling Increase, not merely in the ag gregate of wealth, but in the number of very large individual, and especially of very large corporate, fortunes. The cre ation of these great corporate fortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental action, but to nat ural causes in the business world, oper ating In other countries as they operate in our own. The process has aroused much antag onism, a great part of which is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before has the average man, the wage-worker, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off as In this coun try and at the present time. There have been abuses connected with the accu mulation of wealth yet it remains true that a fortune accumulated in legiti mate business can be accumulated by the person specially benefited only on condition of conferring immense inci dental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise, of the type which benefits all mankind, can only exist if the condi tions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of success. An additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations Is to be found In the international commercial con ditions of today. The same business I conditions which have produced the great aggregations of corporate a*id in- 1 dividual wealth have made them very I potent factors In international com mercial competition. Business con cerns which have the largest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are naturally those which take the lead In the strife for commer clal supremacy among the nations of the world. The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or Ignorance. Many of those who have made it their vocation to de nounce the great industrial combina tions which are popularly, altho with technical inaccuracy, known as "trusts," appeal especially to hatred and fear. These are precisely the two emotions, particularly when combined with Ignorance, which unfit men for the exercise of cool and steady Judgment In facing new Industrial conditions, the whole lii9tory of the world shows that legislation wil generaly be both unwlses and ineffective unless undertaken after calm inquiry and with sober self-re straint. Much of the legislation directed at the trusts would have been exceed ingly mischievous had it not also been entirely ineffective. Ir* dealing with business interests, for the government to undertake by crude and ill-consider ed legislation to do what may turn out to be bad, would be to incur the risk of such far reaching national disaster that it would be preferable to undertake nothing at all. All this Is true: and yet it is also true that there are real and grave evil9, on of the chief being over-capitalization because of its many baleful conse quences and a resolute and practical effort must be made to correct these evils. There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their features and ten dencies hurtful to the general welfare. This springs from no spirit of envy or uncharitableness, nor lack of pride in the great industrial achievements that have placed this country at the head of the nations struggling for commercial supremacy. It does not rest upon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the neces sity of meeting changing and changed conditions of trade with new methods, nor upon ignorance of the fact that com bination of capital In the effort to ac complish great things is necessary when the world's progress demands that great things be done. It is based upon sincere conviction that combination and con centration should be, not prohibited, but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled and in my Judgment this conviction is right. It is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to require that when men receive from govern ment the privilege of doing business un der corporate form,, which frees them from individual responsibility, and en ables tbem to call into their enterprises the capital of the public, they shall do so upon absolutely truthful representa tions as to the value of the property in which the capital Is to be invested. Cor porations engaged in Interstate com merce should be regulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the public injury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social bet terment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corporations exist only because they are created and safe-guarded by our Insti tutions and it is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work In harmony with these institutions. Publicity Needed. The first essential is determining how to deal with the great industrial com binations is knowledge of the facts—, publicity. In the Interest of the public, the government should have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in inter state business. Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now Invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation, or taxation, can only be determined after publicity has been obtained, by process of law, and in the course of administra tion. The first requisite Is knowledge, full and complete—knowledge which may be made public to the world. The large corporations, commonly called trusts, tho orgainzed in one state, always do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are Incorporated. There Is utter lack of uniformity in the state laws about them and as no state has. any excessive interest in or power over their acts, it has in practice proved impossible to get adequate regulation thru state action. Therefore, in the in terest of the whole people, the nation should, without Interfering with the power of the states in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate business. This is especial ly true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tenden cy in its business. There would be no hardship In such supervision banks are subject to It, and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed, it is probable that supervision of corporations by the national govern ment need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over ihem by so conservative a state, as Mas sachusetts, in order to produce excellent results. When the constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no human wisdom could foretell the sweep ing changes, alike in industrial and po litical conditions, which were to take place at the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several states were the properauthorities to reg ulate, so far as was the necessary, the comparatively insignificant and strictly localized corporate bodies of the day. The conditions are now wholly different and wholly different action is called for. I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the national govern ment to exercise control along the lines above indicated profiting by the ex perience gained thru the passage and administration of the Interstate com merce act. If, however, the judgment of congress Is that it lacks the constitu tional power to pass such an act, then a constitutional amendment rfiould be submitted to confer the power.

LAST EDITION, 5 O'CLOCK. MAKSHALTjTOWTS IOWA, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1901 Senate and House Appoint Coir.« mittees to Formulate Program in His Memory. Both Houses Adjourn as a Further Mark of Respect-Today's Proceedings. President Roosevelt's First Mes sage Given Unusual Attention —The Cabinet Meeting. Washington, Dec. 3.—Reading of the president's message in the senate today consumed two hours and fifteen min utes, and when it was completed For aker offered the following resolution: "That a committee of eleven senators be appointed on the part of the senate to Join such committee as shall be ap pointed on the part of the house to con sider and report by what token of re spect and affection it may be proper for the congress of the United States to ex press the deep sensibility of the nation to the tragic death of the late president, William McKinlcy, and that so much of the message of the president as re lates to that deplorable event be refer red to such committee." The resolution was adopted and then, as a further mark of respect to the memory of the late president, the senate adjourned. The House. In the house Bingham, of Pennsylva nia, at the head of the committee ap pointed to wait upon the president, re ported that the committee, accompanied by a like committee from the senate,had performed its duty and the president said he would at once communicate with the two houses In writing. Two minutes later yg jor Pruden appeared at the main entrance and announced the mes sage from the president. Speaker Hen derson handed the document to the reading clerk and directed him to read it. Ordinarily the presidential messages at the opening of congress are listened to In a perfunctory fashion, but today thruout the reading the keenest inter est was manifested. Not a member left his seat until the reading was conclud ed. There was a slight murmur of ap plause when, in concluding the recom mendation for legislation putting down anarchy the clerk read: "No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of congress." There was a burst of applause when the clerk read: "The American people were slow to wrath, but when their wrath Is once kindled It burns like a consuming lanif- other portion of the message attracted so much attention as that relating to trusts. No demonstra tion was evoked by the reading of this portion of the message, but the recom mendation for re-ennctment of the Chi nese exclusion law drew applause from both sides of the house. The reading of the message was con cluded in the house at 2:35. Grosvenor then offered a resolution of respect to the late president similar to the one adopted by the senate. The resolution was adopted. The house then, as a fur ther mark of respect, adjourned. Flood of Bills. Washington, Dec. 3.—The flood of bills is so great in the house that the total clerical staff was kept busy all last night and managed! to- get abreast of $70 public and 1,113 private bills, a total If 1,392 or about half of all those In troduced. Representative Brown-low, of Tennessee, led the list with 252 bills and resolutions. THE 

CABINET MEETING. Roosevelt and His Advisers Discuss the Insular Decisions. Washington, Dec. 3.—The cabinet meeting today was principally con turned In discussing the decisions hand ed down yesterday by the supreme court. On the whole it is believed the view of the majority of the court is quite satisfactory to the administra tion. It was pointed out that the ulti mate results of the decisions are in a measure speculative at present, with the exception of the customs duties collected in this country on goods shipped from the Philippines since the ratification of the Paris treaty will have to be re funded. It is not thought the aggregate will be large. Secretary Gage expects It to be within a million dollars. The pres ent tariff now in operation in the Philip pines, Gage thinks, will need little or no revision. Preparation of a tariff on Philippine importations Into the United States, however, is expected to consume considerable time of oongresa LIVESTOCK MEN MEET. Fifth Annual Convention in Session at Chicago. Chicago, Dec. 3.—The fifth annual convention of the National Live Stock Association began here today with nearly a thousand delegates present. Tt Is expected that the convention will be In session until Friday. The annual ad dress of Hon. John W. Springer, presi dent of the association, was read during this mornings' session. The feature of the afternon session was the address of Secretary of Agri culture Wilson. The report of Secretaary Charles F. Martin was devoted to the work accom plished during the past year by the different committees and the officers of the organization. The membersship is Increasing, and the finances more satis factory th-an ever before. Mr. F. J. Hagenbarth, of Idaho, read a paper in "The Adulteration of Wool." He presented facts to show that wool is adulterated and said that such audlter atlon deprived the wool grower of a much enlarged market and was there fore a material injury to his interests and called for prompt regulation. It was also to the interests of the wool manufacture that adulteration should be curtailed. The public, he said, did not demand) the adulterated stuff, but •it was the clothier and the cheap retail er and the bogus manufacturer who be- gulled the public into the belief that it was buying all wool when in reality it was buying shoddy and cotton and was paying all-wool prices therefor. He urged the passage of a bill by congress providing for the inspection of woolen goods and shoddy and trie prop er stamping of the same, a fine of from J50 to $500 to be imposfd for each viola tion of the law by a manufacturer, and from $100 to $1,000 for a denier who buys unstamped adulterated cloth or sells it, in the piece or as clothing. The Hon. J. Sterling Morton, ex-secre tary of agriculture, read a paper en titled "The Inconsistency of the Grout BUI," which provides for a tax upon butterlne and oleomargarine. The Hon. Frank Bennet't spoke of "The Proper Method of Marketing Wool." He urged organization and co-opera tion on the part of wool growers, saying that unless organization became gener al they might look in vain for a union among wool growers to direct the wool trade of the United States into chan nels advantageous to the growers. Combinations, he said, were arising among merchants and manufacturers, but if they were united' while the grow ers were divided the producers of wool would have all the disadvantages which come from ruinous competition among themselves, arrayed' against combina tion among the purchasers of their pro duct. He urged as a barfs for organization the demanding for wool the same recog nition as a merchandise collateral that is now extended' to other great staple products the same warehouse facilities for wool that exist for wheat, cotton and other staples t'he establishment of as standard and well recognized grades of wool as the varied conditions of the sheep husbandry would permit to dis seminate information as to value and grade to make advance and sell wools and to secure advantageous freight rates. No Industry in the United States, he said, had probably turned out so poorly in the last ten years as the wool indus try because while every other line of business had been reduced to something like a scientific basis the wool business has continued to be conducted under antiquated conditions. HORSE VS. HORSE. Morse Calls Before His Erstwhile Wife Had Left and Raises a Row—Mrs. Morse and the Cook Put Him Out— Yhe Police and Atorneys Called. Special to Times-Republican., Grinnell. Dec. 3.—C. R. Morse, the de fendant in the recent sensational di vorce suit of Morse vs.,Morse, and In the settlement of which he was mulcted to the amount of $20,000 alimony, has broken out In another spot. This time it is a disgraceful row In his own house, an alleged- assault by Mm upon the per soOr of his .ftrm#B.spouse. and.the ig aoRitiy being bu.idtea ttteefc an-1 crop from hI9 ftom'ft at tire kands of the. fe male cook employed' In his kitchen that adds luster to Mr. Morse's previous no toriety. When Morse andi his wife reached a settlement in their rather nasty di vorce case among other provisions was one compelling the wife to vacate the home residence about Dec. 1. It ap pears that last Saturday Mrs. Morse had told' him when he called upon her that she would vacate the premises Tuesday o£.the present week. This Morse told Mrs. Morse would be satisfactory. Instead of standing to his agreement, Morse it is alleged, returned to the house and ordered the woman to leave ut once. According to her story he as sailed her violently, manually and rhe torically. He says he didn't. She called for the police. He countermanded the order and cut the telephone wire, isolat ing the seat of war from connection with the outside world, and' the emeute proceeded. The cook, a lusty female, threw her portly person into the breach and espoused her mistress' cause. To gether they incontinently fired Morse. He had gained possession of certain keys, however, and locked the front en trance, the cellar door and a room on the second floor containing Mrs. Morse's traveling suit. Mrs. Morse hastened to Dr. Hedge's residence and thence tele phoned her attorney. He in company with an attorney.for Mr. Moree and the deputy marshal ar ranged an armistice. Morse unlocked the doors, returned the keys and de parted. The police were instructed to guard the house until Mrs. Morse and her belongings were safely away and out of danger. The cause of the trouble appears to have been that Mr. Morse insisted on searching Mrs. Morse's belongings for property which he claimed she was at tempting to make away with. He claims to have found a number of his shirts, a candelabra and a French mirror parked with her goods. Mrs. Morse says she has no use for Mr. Morse's shirts and knows nothing about them. She admits taking the candelabra and says it was a present to her. A little French plate mirror was dis covered at Strable's last Friday. Strable was packing her things. Morse insisted that it was his and the woman, to avoid a row, gave it up, tho she says It was a birthday present two years ago and has always been used In her own room. She naturally thought it was a part of her "personal belongings" which were set apart to her in the de cree. The whole thing is most disgraceful and the strange part of it is, that Mr. Morse does not seem to realize it. Mrs. Morse is not his wife and he had no business In the house while she waa there. The remarkable magnanimity toward his .wife professed at the trial when he said he would have given her $10,000 had the suit gone against her seems to have been lacking when it came to little things such as mirrors and can delabras. Mrs. Morse still retains her friends in Grinnell despite the attacks of a local paper. Three very estimable ladles sent her an invitation only a few days ago to a reception held on High street on the afternoon of the 22 Inst., and since then she has been invited to one of the finest homes on Boohe street to a reception to be given next Friday. Prisoner Doomed to the Gallows Makes a Desperate Attempt to Escape. Brains Priest Who Had Come to Give Him the Final Con* solation. Gets Into Corridor and Attempts to Scale Wall»Story of Crime.

The sheriff threat ened to shoot Brown, who, seeing the Impossibility of escape, finally surren dered and was led back to his cell. Washington Hunter, for whose murder Brown was hanged, was a wealthy re tired farmer of 70 years. He lived with his wife at Riverside, N. J. On the night of Jan. 25 last Charles Brown, John Young, Charles Miller and Otto Keller forced an entrance to the Hunter house with the intention of robbing the place. Hunter resisted and was brutally beaten with an iron bolt. His wife brought him a revolver with which he defended him self until hia assailants were frightened away. Hunter died four days later.
