I However, it was not expected that th. speaker would touch the questions to hi ui-iui in uy mo nouse. Ex-Speaker Crisp assumed the leader ship of the minority, ami it was signiti cunt that Mr. Payne of New York m:uh the motion which usually devolves upoi the leader of the majority. This is takci. to mean that ho is to be the chairman o' the .ways and means committee and tin recognized, leader of the Republicans or the tioor. An arrangement was entered into by which the Republicans shouli' have the first tiers of the seats on the Democratic side alid also the last two tiers. Three hundred and fifty-six num bers were placed in a box and shaken np. A blindfolded page drev out the ballots and the members selected their seats bp their names were drawn., According to the usual custom, the house granted the ex-speakers. Mr. Crisp of Georgia, and Mr. Gro,w of Pennsylvania, the privilege of selecting their seats without drawing. Mr. Crisp selected a seat in the heart of the Democratic minority and Mr. Grow took a seat near the center of the Repub lican side. j. The name of McClure (Rep.), Ohio, was the first drawn from the box. Messrs. Owens (Dem), Kentucky, the suc cessor of Mr. Breckinridge, was the sec ond and Mr.Parkins (Rep.), Iowa, was the third. Popular members were applaud ed as they came forward and selected their places, and the page boys scooted from desk to desk, conveying lloral pieces sent by admiring friends. Before thodrawing was half completed the array of desks was transformed into n bower Sf roses. Among those , who were thus remembered were ex-Speaker Crisp and Mr. Bnrtlctt (Dem.) of New York, who drew the "booby prize." His was the last name called. As soon as the drawing was completed the house, on motion of Mr. Payne of New York, adjourned until tomorrow. Highest award at World's Fair went to Dr. Price's Baking Powder. o THE HOUSE. Washington, Dec. 2. The Fifty-fourth house of representatives was called to order today. At 15 minutes of 12 the floor was clear ed and those who had not the privilege of the floor reluctantly retired and sought at the thronged doors of the gnlleries an opportunity to get a glimpse of the proceedings below. . As the hands of the clock opposite the speaker's desk pointed to 12, Colonel '-Ike" Hill, the deputy sergeaut-at-arms, lifted into its place on the green pedestal alongside the rostrum the ebony eagle-surmounted mace, the emblem of the house authority; the llag above the house was run up and Clerk Kerr called the Fifty-fourth house of representatives to order. A hush immediately fell upon the as sembly, and Rev. Bagley of this city, the chaplain of the house, offered the invocation. Under the direction of Mr. Kerr the roll of members elected to the Fifty fourth house was called. Mr. Kerr announced that 311 of the 3."i0 members of the house were present, and also that no credentials had been received from the Tenth New York and the First Nevada districts. Mr. Kerr then called the nominations for speaker. No nominating speeches were made. Mr. Grosvenor (Rep.), Ohio, chairmou of the Republican caucus, placed in nom ination Thomas B. Reed of Maine; Mr. layers (Dem.), Texas, the name of Cbas. F. Crisp of Georgia, and Mr. Kem (Pop.), Nebraska. J. C Bell of Colorado. The names of both Mr. Reed and Mr. Crisp were vigorously applauded by their party associates. Messrs. Hopkins (Rep.), Illinois, Loud (Rep.), California. Erdniann (Dem.), l'enn sylvania, and Cntchings (Dem.), Missis sippi, were appointed tellers and the roll was called, the constitution requiring the elect ion of speakers by viva voce vote. All the Republicans voted for Mr. Reed; with one exception all the Demo crats for Mr. Crisp and all the Populists for Mr. Bell. The exception was Mr. ('rain, a Democrat from Texas, who. when his name was called, voted for his colleague Mr. Culberson of Texas. The result of the vote was: Reed, 234; Crisp, 05; Bell, C; Culberson. 1. Mr. Kerr's announcement of Mr. Reed's election 'was greeted with a thunder of applause. Messrs. Crisp, Grosvenor and Bell were appointed a committee to conduct the speaker to the chair, and soon ap peared at the main entrance, Mr. Reed leaning on the arm of ex-Speaker Crisp and Messrs. Grosvenor and Bell arm in arm. As they moved down the center aisle the house rose en masse. A roar of applause followed, the gallery follow ing with great enthsiasm in the demon stration. As Mr. Reed ascended the rostrum the roar swelled until it was deafening. Above this volume of sound came like pistol shots cries of "lieed, Reed. Reed!" , The Republicans cheered, many of thorn wildlv, and the ladies in the galleries waved handkerchiefs. For over a min ute the demonstration continued.

CAUCUS. Washington, Dec. 2. The Republican senators were not in caucus for half an hour afer the senate adjourned today, but adjourned until Wednesday without Inking any action on the reorganization of the senate. Mr. Sherman was elected chairman of the caucus and Mr. Dubois secretary. The discussion was informal and centered around the question whether the Repub lican senators, having a plurality between a majority of the senate, should attempt reorganization with Republican ollicers mid Republican chairmen of committees. It was evident that the prevailing senti ment favored Republican organization, and some strong speeches were made, notably by Messrs. Davis of Minnesota nnd Aldrich of Rhode Island, urging that there should be no combination or promise with any element outside the Republican ranks. This appeared to voice the general view of seuutors, and no opposition speeches were made. The question arose, however, as to whether the test of strength should be made on securing the committees or choice of a president pro tern. In order to prevent this issue Mr.' Hoar moved the appointment of a committee on com mittees, to have charge of a move to se cure reorganization on Republican lines. Mr. Hale offered ah amendment for a test on the choice of president pro torn. In the formal discussion following Mr. Fryc's name was mentioned as the prob able candidate for president pro tern. Some senators raised the point, however, that the president pro tern could not be elected while the presidng ollicer was present, nnd acting under the same rules it was finally decided that no vote should lie taken at present, and Messrs. Hoar nnd Hale withdrew their motions. The understanding was that a definite line of action would be agreed on at the meeting Wednesday following the ses sion of that day. The main reason for the withdrawal of the motion to appoint the committee by the chairman was the discovery of the fact that there was a large element in the caucus opposed to the selection of the committee by appoint ment.

Members express surprise that no recommendation wns made for the supply of the treasury deficit. In the discussion of foreign affairs the portion devoted to the enforcement of the Mon roe doctrine, in connection with the boundary line dispute, and the sugges tions regarding Cuba attracted special ttention, but the main interest centered in the recommendations for the retire ment of the greenbacks and the exten sion of the National banking system. Several of the Democratic leaders who differ with the president on the financial question refused to express their opin ions lor puhlicntion. the Kcpufilicuiis of the senate do not approve the president's message so far as it concerns finances. It matters not whether they be silver men or not, they all have something to say against it. Many senators expressed the opinion that the message was disappointing, be cause it did not provide a method for raising revenue. All of the Republicans who are known as sound money men were especially dis appointed on account of this feature of the message, ihe silver men, of course, were very emphatic in their disapproval of the president's views on silver. For the most part, however, the Republicans spoke in terms of approval of the posi tion of the president regarding foreign nffnirs, but more especially as to what be said about enezueln. Ihe silver Democrats had very little to say regard ing the message and it was for the most part a disappoinment for them. There was a general impression in tne senate that the proposition of the president to retire the greenbacks would not lie suc cessful. 

LONDON COMMENTS. London. Dec. 3. Newspapers will very generally contain editorial cements upon President I lovelanu s inessuge to con gress. The Graphic says: "The crudities and indiscretion of Presi dent Cleveland's present proniicinmento on foreign affairs might have been evolved bv the late Mr. Blaine in his worst mood. Can anything be more absurd than the proposal that the Hchomberg line (in Veneznehi). should be submitted to ar bitration? "The reference to Cuba is infinitely more judicious. It is virtually an ex pression of sympathy with filibustering." The Times' editorial says: "President Cleveland has drawn a startling picture of the difficulties created bv the vicious currency system and wc shall be greatly surprised if the plans he suggests are not warmly welcomed by business men throughout the States. But, flushed by election victories, it is probable enough that the Republicans will refuse to allow nnything to be done in the direction indicated. Meanwhile the remainder of the message, especially with reference to foreign relations, will give the impression hat he is marking time. Nothing, he says, commits him to a new aggressive foreign policy, whilst it will task the igneuity of his oppon ents to make out that he has in any way compromised the dignity or been careless of the interests of his own country." The Daily News, the liberal organ, will say: "President Cleveland knows better thnn to treat the Monroe doctrine as if jt were a rule of International law. It is neither dignified nor politic for the ad niuistration at Washington to take up the quarrels of South America communi ties which do not observe the usages of civilised nations. , "America will find some day that this sort of patronage iuvolves a correspond ing responsibility nnd they will not like that at all." The Standard, the Conservative or gan, says: "We cannot but regret the tone of President Cleveland's reference to Vene zuela. If we may judge from the tone and substance of Mr. Olney's dispatch, from the paraphrase thus imparted to congn-ss, we are not surprised that no answer uns neon received, and we fur ther undertake to predict that when the report reaches the White house it will furnish the president with a deal of mat ter for serious reflection. We must be pardoned if we venture to sny that the noie passage reiomng to enezueln is a tissue of unreal assumptions nnd un supported deductions. If the Americans desire to curry out the views thus ex- iresseu xney win do m after the calcu lation of the cost. K von if wo wivrw eager for arbitration, the experience of the Behring sea controversy would hardly encouraue us. It is not onmr i argue calmly when we find' that Presi dent Cleveland lias already prejudiced the merits of the dispute. But even strong States have rights, and though Great Britnin is able to maintain its dignity nnd interests it ought not to b a mark - for nublie affront i n n lirntik dentin! message. We are not much im pressed with bis currency proposals; he suggests n palliative and not n cure." The Post,. Conservative, says: "As regards : Samoa and Venezuela, the message appears to be framed on lines which Senator Chandler might ap prove. In regard to Cuba, thorn nr.. similar signs of a disposition to con ciliate the feelings of popular agitators. These thimrs are incidents nf miv nrnui. dentin! campaign nnd President Cleve land never pretended to bo superior to flints ' An editorial in the Chronicle says: "It is very doubtful if rnmrrnHa will nccept President Cleveland's currency plan. The message sounds cautious, but there is a note in the direction of free trade. "Ihe reference to Armenln must hn re garded as the definite ndherence of the United States to the European concert. Few honest critics can say anything against President Cleveland's reference to Venezuela. Wo agree with him that the boundary dispute is eminently suited to arbitration and undoubtedly our gov ernment will take the same view. It must lie remembered that this question is quite distinct from that of the repara tion due us by Venezuela for injuries. When such reparation is made every liberal in the country will acquiesce in Venezuela's demands." The Chronicle concludes its editorial by asking whether America is ready to undertake the responsibility thus incur red for the faithful discharge of their ob ligations by the American republics.
