Hill, then president 'of the Manitoba system of rails and loco motives, began the work of establishing town sites in the Far Northwest future feeders of his transcontinental line one of the first to be laid out was Blue Duck. While the community nourished for two or more years, changes in the wheat territory and shifting of the cat tle ranges destroyed its trading area and finally effaced it from the map. But there must be a great many men still living who passed through the portals of Blue Duck In the its best hours, knew its joys and sorrows, its hot passions and wasted hopes, and will recall the day and the afternoon that Carter call ed for his last drink. When Carter first came to Blue Duck there were in the town a future Governor of a State, a future United States Minister abroad, a coming .ad viser of presidents, an embryo railway president and an extheologlcal student, who later was to control for some time all the faro layouts of New York city. Mixed in with these geniuses were cow boys of Southwestern origin, Nor wegians and Swedes fresh from Europe, half-breed Sioux and a few negroes. The town lay flat, bare, naked on the plain. There was not a beautiful thing in it, about it or near it but Carter's wife, and she was as unapproachable as Arcturus. Carter was a graduate of the Uni versity of Iowa, a descendant of ancient New England governors and lawmak ers, a Puritan bred and a scoundrel by heart. . He appeared in Blue Duck as a surveyor for the branch line of the Manitoba road, which was then in course of construction. His wife did not come until several months after he had established the reputation of being the hardest drinker, foulest-mouthed gambler and most indecent person be tween the Missouri and the Red river. For all his failings, in his best mo ments he was smooth-tongued, well ed ucated and an artificial gentleman. It wl be remembered that he engaged one afternoon in a discussion with "Gentle man Ed,", the proprietor of gambling games of the region Greek interpretation of the verse: "Whosover comcth anything near unto the tabernacle of the Lord shall die; shall we be consumed with dying?" The verse is found in Numbers, and it has been said by learned men that be tween the Greek version, the Hebraic phrasing and the Latin interpreation a twist has been given to this verse not intended by the original compiler, who ever he may have been. It was a delight to all who under stood at all and even to many who did not to listen to these two versatile pin ners discuss Phoenician of their letters, neither writing and the values of their letters, neither willing to finally e.ocerft the dictum of the other, each recalling a better day in lives now well mis spent. It may be here said that the only rea son Carter was not shot for all his bad qualities was not due to his learning, but to the fact that he was the best man with a single-actor gun on the range, barring "Gentleman Ed," and these two had to come together yet. Mrs. Carter arrived In Blue Duck. We knew he was coming, for one day Carter ceased boarding at the Oriental and threw up a shack on the south border of the town. As it had two roomsand a kitchen, it was quite evident he expect ed the arrival of a woman. When he announced that his wife was on the way evrybody felt Interested except "Gentle man." He told the solitary newspaper man of Blue Duck: . "We've got along six months without ! a woman, except those crazy half- breeds that come here trading, and I i believe we have a great future before us if we can keep women out. They i make trouble." Still "Ed" was In front of the Oriental when the stage brought Mrs. Carter, end she steeped from the box to the ground and her husband. Blue Duck gasped after it had given her one look. Mrs. Carter's attire was quite simple n s-vflv traveling skirt, a waist and jacket of dark blue hue, a dark, soft Uwa, nvital, v,o- wllh a taninli'.iner fppther In I Kent the band, gauntlet gloves and heavy walking shoes. Little of that Blue Duck saw then. -' What Blue Duck took In with amaze ment was that shhe was not over 21 (Carter was 40) and straight as an ar row. Every line of her, form was mold ed as if a Canova had gone over her when nature finished its. work. Her hair was heavy and wavy brown, her eyes dtep brown, her skin as white as marble except where slight flushes of pink revealed the touch of the range wind. For all this she might have been marble so far as expression or life of manner was concerned. She gave Carter one glance when she greeted him, and that glance said to Blue Duck: "This man Is my husband. The law, society and everything else hold me to him. There Is nothing in common be tween us, but my duty is clear. I wish no help. Only let me alone and do not show pity." Blue Duck understood. Blue Duck made no comments. If there was one thing that Blue Duck prided itself on It was the fact that It never knocked, tat tled, gossiped. Blue Duck was at the service of Mrs. Carter from the instant it set eyes upon her, but Blue Duck had nothing to say of either of her or her husband. Only quiet, telephatical ly. Blue Duck knew before Mrs. Car tor was a day in the town thnt 1f ever she needed help "GentlemanEd" would take the initiative for the honor of the community. He had said nothing pub licly, but the night she came when he was turning into bed he remarked to the man with him: "That woman's being crucified." And the other laconically answered: "Well?" After this both slept. As for Carter, he became meaner, more vicious, more brutal, after the ar rival of his wife. Blue Duck soon learn ed that he struck her: that he finished his debauches in her presence; that sometimes she was penniless; that she never came into town from the shack . ' ' if she could avoid it; that she often played the guitar when alone; that she was fond of books and music, but Blue Duck held ita peace. It was waiting for Carter to do some public wrong in con nection with her. The wrong come. One afternoon Car ter stumbled Into the One Dollar cara vansary, reeled to the bar and with a gulp announced: "I'm goin' to take my last drink. I'm goin' to take it an' then clean out the town. You hear me? I'm tired of ev erythin, here, an' I'm going to drop the liquor, make my mark on you, an' move on." He had both his pistols out by this time, and Blue Duck was politely listen ing. He straightened up and went on: "I'm goin' up an' get that woman of mine, and she's goin' to take my last drink with me. You wait. He ga-e his guns a quick flourish and moved off toward his shack. "Gentle man Ed" was at the postofflce when he learned what was about to happen. He took in the men about him with a com prehensive roll of his eye. "She's a woman, boys, and a lady," he said. Figuratively, Blue Duck instantly placed itself behind him. What he was t going to do met its approval. He walk ed down the dusty street towaml the One Dollar. From the other end of the street came Carter, his wife walking ahead of him, one of his guns covering her, the other sweeping the street. He literally drove the woman, whose face was whiter than snow, into the One Dollar, and shunted to the bartender: "Two glasses and the liquor."- i One glass was set before Mrs. Carter and one before her husband. Then' through the back door came "Gentle man Ed," and his hands were working like chain lightning. His fust shot broke Mrs. Carter's glass, his second broke Carter's, and his third killed him. As for Ed himself, he was shot twice through the shoulder before Carter went down, but the wounds were slight. A week later it was "Gentleman Ed" that escorted Mrs. Carter to the south bound stage and in the name of Blue Duck said to her: "Our work Is here; your back in your old home. If you ever need a friend and any of us here," indicating the crowd of bareheaded men, "are on earth, send for us. Good-by." In that way Bluck Duck not only be friended an unhappy woman, but aided Carter In taking his last drink. H. L. Cleveland, in Chicago Record-Herald. Scrlven, who lived for several years in the town of Port Hope, Canada. He was born in Dublin in 1820, was educa ted at Trinity college, and graduated ted with full honors from that institu tion. He came to Canada in 1815, where he lived a most useful life until his death In 1S86. Having an income from the old coun try sufficient to support him, he spent his entire time in preaching and other forms of Christian work. At the races, the fairs, on the streets, and wherever crowds congregated Joseph Scrlven was accustomed to call sinners to repen tance. . It is said that, when he was a young man, on the eve of. his weddine-day the young lady to whom he was to be mar ried was accidentally drowned, and he was so deeply impressed with the van ity of all earthly Joys that he consecra ted his life and fortune to the service of Christ. A large part of his time was taken up in visiting the sick and help ing the poor. One forenoon he was seen walking down the street in Port Hope, dressed in a plain suit of tweed such as a thrifty workingman would wear, and carrying a saw-horse and saw. A citizen, see ing a friend recognized him, said; "Do NEW 

BOOKS BY YALE MEN. A Library of Ancient Inscriptions Edi ted by Professors Kent and San ders. Under the general editorship of Charles Foster Kent, Ph.D., Woolsey professor of Biblical literature in Yale university, and Frank Knight Sanders, Ph.D.. D. D., professor of Biblical his tory and archaeology in Yale universi ty, Charles Rerlhner's? Rons are about to publish a library of ancient inscrip tions, prepared by leading scholars in America, England and Germany. Out of the already extensive monumental literature, those texts have been care fully selected which are of real vaule to students of history, literature, so clnl science and religion. While no Im portant inscriptions will be omitted, duplication will, as far as 'possible, be avoided. The library will contain many texts hitherto unpublished. The volumes will also be supplied with general introductions gpresentin historical, literary and other data ne cessary for the appreciation of the texts. Carefully prepared section headings i are to be provided Indicating the gene ! ral nature of the contents, and side headings on the margins, giving a con densed analysis of the accompanying text. Each volume, or group of Inscriptions, has been entrusted to an acknowledged authority in the department presented. It will aim to present lucidly and con neotedly in English idioms the purport : of the Inscriptions. Interpretative foot notes, historical maps, chronological ta bles and indices will complete the , equipment of each volume. I No effort will be spared to make the 1 series a complete trustworthy compen dium of the important results of the excavations conducted during the past I century in Babylonia, Assyria, Syria, j Arabia and Egypt. The nine volumes ! already arranged, with the names of the men who are preparing them, are as follows: I.

I want some I one to cut wood, and find it difficult to ' get a sober man who will dn such work faithfully." "But you can't get that man," was the reply. "That is Mr. Scrlven. He won't cut wood for you." "Why not?" queried the gentleman, "Because you are able to pay for it. He saws wood for poor widows and sick people, and often sends them wood." i Upon one occasion he found a family in the greatest wretchedness, with the head of the household very 111. Mr. Scriven paid their rent, got them a better house, and provided wood and other necessaries. Then, and not till then, did he talk religion to them. Nobody ever suspected that he had any poetical gift until a short time be fore his death. A neighbor was sitting up with him, and while the patient was asleep accidentally found .a manu script copy of "What a friend we have In Jesus!" and read It with great de light. When Mr. Scriven was ques tioned about it, he said that he had composed it for his mother. He had sent her a copy to comfort her in some great sorrow, and had kept this copy for himself, never Intending that any one else should see it. Some "time later a Port Hope gentle man said to him: "Mr. Scriven, it is said that you composed the hymn, 'What a friend we have in Jeusl' Is it so?" He replied, "The Lord and I did it between us." The hymn is undoubtedly one thnt will live. Rev. A. C. Crews in the Christian Endeavor World. they will imitate the vowel sounds. Thus different phonetic syllables may be obtained which may be used to form an international alphabet. Another important application of this synthetic process can be made in the construction of ear trumpets that will not fatigue the deaf, because they will not modify the grouping of oscillation adapted to the ear. Dr. Marage has also constructed the "acouometer," giving a typical sound of tlie vowel "a," for ex ample, which may be used as a standard to which certain other sounds may be referred. Thus there are far greater possibili ties for this self-talking machine than appear from a first glance at it. Now that it is possible to make exact me chanical reproductions of the human mouth with pliable lips, , perfect teeth, and all the wonderful inner mechanism, it will be possible to use these mechan ical word producers on a magnified scale on steamships at night and in fogs, and many disasters may thereby be averted. At present Dr. Marage is engaged In perfecting his invention and studying particularly those words in the produc tion of which the cheeks play a more or less important part, for in this direc tion he feels he has not yet achieved perfection.
