Few messages have ever been presented to Congress so completely synoptical and so fullv exprvsslve of the wlihes of the Chief Magistrate as the one transmitted yesterday. We cannot dubt that every measure sug gested w4I be acted npoa before the close of the session. It was anticipated the President would allude to the proposed International Indus trial Exhibition, but we are led to believe that he will, at no distant day, make this the subject of a special message.

The lUrcnucii had the honor of offering It to our citizens fcllt twextt miscth In advance of lu co tempo raries, and the scene about the RircnLicaf office, as the news-boys presented themselves for tho "extras," reminded one very forcibly of the lively demand for tho latest news In wartimes.

I alto recommend that th mission to Uhlna be railed toooe of the Oret class. Oa my aisumlog th responsible duties of Chief Magistral ol th Culled States, It was with a conviction that thr things were essential to its peace, prosperity and fullest development. First among thes Is strict In trgrltjr la fulfllllag all our obligations, second, to secure protection to th person and prop erty or the cltlienof th United males, lo each and every portion of our common coun try, wherever he may ehose to move, without reference to original nationality, religion, color, or polities, demaadlsg of him only obe dience to th law, aad proper resiieet fer the rights or others Third, Union of all th statee, (with equal rights,) Indestructible by any constitutional means. To secure ih first of these, Congress has taken two essential stepet flrat, In declaring, by Joint resolution, that the publle debt shall be paid, principal and Interest, lo coin. And eecond, by providing th means for paying. Providing th meaos, however.eould not secure th object desired without a proper administra tion 01 th laws for th collection ot th reve nues, and an economical disbursement of them To this subject tha Administration has meat earnestly addressed Itself, with results, I hope, satisfactory to the country, Thcr has beeu so hesitation In chauxlnt omelale in order to securo aa fflelsnt execution of the laws, sometimes, too, where, lo a mer parly view, undesirable political results were likely to fol low, nor any hesitation In sustalolog efficient ofuclals against remonstrances wholly pa lin eal. II may be well to mention here the embar rassment possible to arts fron leaving 00 the statute books the so-called "Tenure of ottlce acts," and to earnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been the Intention of theframcre of theOonstltutlou when pro viding that appointment made br the Preil dent should receive th consent or tha senate, that th latter should hav Ih power to re tain In one persons placed there by Federal appointment against ihewlllof the President. The law Is Inconsistent with a faithful and etnelent administration of the Ooverniuent What faith ean an Executive put In officials forced upon him, and those to whom he has suspended for reason! Howw'll sueh officials be likely to serve aa administration which they know does not trust them! or the second requisite to our growth and prosperity, time and a firm but humane ad ministration or exlstloa- laws (amended from time to time as they mj prove lncrTeetlve, or rrvvc naiau du uunttiiiirj; nrw luuujtuij nit hat are required. Th third cannot bi attained by special legislation, but must h regarded as fixed by the Constitution Itself and gradually aequf esced lu by fore of public opinion. irom th foundation or the Government to th present, the management or the orgloal Inhabitant of this continent, the Indians, has been a subject or embarrassment and expense, and has been attended with eontlnuoua robberies, murders and wars. Irom my own experience upon th frootlere and In Indian countries, Ida not hold cither legislation or the conduct of the whites who soma inner la eontaet with the Indian blameless for the hostilities Th past, however, cannot be uu done, and the Question muit ba mat aa wi now find It I have attempted a nsw policy towards incie warm 01 ine nation (inajcaauui do re garded in anr other lliht than as wards) with air results, eofar as tried, which I hope will be attended ultimately with great success. lhe Society ol Friends la well known as having succeeded In living In peace with tha Indians lo the earlv settlement of rcnnsvl vanla, wbtle their while neighbors or other eots.ln other sections, were constantly em broiled. They are also known for their oppo sition to all strife, violence and war, and are generally noted for their strict Integrity and fair dealings These consideration induced me to give the management or a few reserva tions of Indians to them, and to throw the burden or selection or agents upon the oeiety itiflf. The result has itrnven moat aatlafBn. tory. It will be found more fully set forth In the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affair. For superintendents and Indian agents not on the reservations, officer of the army were selected The reasons lor this are numerous. Where Indian agents are sent, there or near thcr troops must be sent also Tne agent and the commander of troops arc In dependent of each other, and are subject to orders from different departments of the Gov ernment. Th army officer holds a poaltlonfor lirei th agent on at th will of the President The former Is personally Interested lo living lo harmony with th Indian and lo establish log a permanent peace, to th end that some portion of his life may be spent within the limits or civilised society. The Utter has 00 such personal Utereet. Another reason is au economic one and still another, the hold which th Government has upon a life officer to secure a faithful discharge of duties In car rying out a given polley. The bull ling of railroads and the access thereby given to all agricultural and mineral tribe of Indians. No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements an 1 the aborigines, the faet le they do not har moo lie well, and one or lhe other has lo give way in the end. A system whleh looks tothe extinction of a race Is too horrible for a u- tlon to adopt without entailing upon l'aelf s wrain oi auunrisienuom.and engendering the cltlieaa disregard for human tile and the rlchts of Others danaeroua to aoelett aee no substitute for sueh a ststem eni. In placing all the Indians on Urge reserva tions as rapidly as It can be done, and giving them absolute protection there. As soon as they are fitted for It they should be Induced to take their lands tn severalty, and set up ter ritorial governments for their own protection For full details on this subject I call your spe clal attention to th reports of the Secretary of the Interior and th Commissioner of Iu dUn Affairs Th report of the Secretary of War show tha expenditures of the War Department for tha year ending the aoth of June, 1SC9, to be 180,644 012, of which 123,893,310 was disbursed In the payment of debts eontraeted during the war, and Is not chargeable to current army expenses. His estimate ofs.l4.S31 031, for the expenses of th army forth next flscalyetr Is as low as It Is believed can be relied on. The estimates of buieau o racers have been carefully scrutinised and reduced wherever it has been deemed practicable. If, however, th condition of the eountr) should be sueh, by the beginning of the next fiscal ear, as to admit of a greater concentra tion of troops, th appropriation asked for will not be expeoded.

Whatever amount Congress may deem proper to appro priate for the purposes wilt be expended. The recommendation of th Ocneral of the Army that appropriations be made for the forts at notion, Portland, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans and San Francisco, If for no other, Is concurred In. I also ask yourspeeial attention to the recommendation of the gen eral commending th military division of tho Pacific for th sal of the heal Islands of M Paul and 8t.

As suming that honest men maybe obtained for these Important posltioiiB at the present sala ries, It Is jet true that an Incompetent ap pralser or ex .miner may daily subject the Goternment to losses farexceedlng his annual salary Under existing Uws, certain revenue officer and other persons appearing aa Informers ars enlltled to ehares In lines, penalties, and for. feMures During the tlscal ear UoJ-W the Treasury Department distributed the sum of W0,OT3 ul to sueh ottlcera and to Informers In the various eases nrlamg un ler the customs revenue laws. A Urge additional sum was auo paid through the internal ret enue omce. The reason on which th law granting such allowances are based Is that officers of the Government arestlmulated togreater activity in iiib unuwTury ui irauus, nnu in uringing offenders to puulshment There can be no doubt such Is the effect of the poller) but the lng th system are greater than th benetlts derived from It It often occurs that revenue otllccrs are led to assert claims In behalf of the Government which hava uo Just founds tlon In law or In the facts of the respective easest and where real claims exlst.lt Is often theobifctof the Informer and o Ulcer who hire In the penalties to misrepresent the ease tu lhe Department, bo as to secure the great est adtaulage to themselves llut a more ... n..,n...kS , I'l"".... , "u ?

It has become a practice for clerks and other f arsons who have held oUJco in the Tresaury lepartment to accept employment a agent or attorneys for parties having claims against the Department, aud there is reason to believe that In some Instances the Information ob taloed while In the publlo service liaa bean used In aid of tho claimants Without detail ing all the objections to this practice, I re spectfully suggest that a law be passed birring persons from prnctlclng before the Treasury Depart ment as agrnts or attorneys In behalf of claims that were pending when such persons were olllce rs of the Department Jn March last there were rmido)ed lu tha Treasury Department at Washington 2,sll cleiks, niessengors, nnd laborers, at a monthly cost of t240,Jl fl At preaent the whole num. berofsuchemploye 12 411, and their monthly pa amounta lo tUoMfiu 84, showing a decrease of ixpeuses at the rate of sill, to 04 per an oum it was found necetnarj, however, dur lng the period mentioned, to Increase the fnrce In the Internal ret time otllce of the Hnt Comptroller This Increase, In the aggregate, Is at the rate of 40,41u per annum This state ment does not relate lo the force employed In the bureau of engraving and printing In March last there were Blzty-twa specUl agents In the service of tho Department, re cilvlng.ln the aggregate, for their tervlcis.the BumollJTllO per day.

Home of the salaries were llxed when the Government was organtied, ethers when new omces were added, and but few of tbemhave been Increased recently. It is un questionably true that persona having equal ability aud clothed with similar reipouslbi.it) receive much Itrger compensation from In dividuals aud corporations I and although many of tha officers now tn the publlo service are likely to continue, from the circumstance that their vocation has led them aside Irom the ordinary channels of business, yet, as an act of Justice lo them, and la the luterest of the Government, 1 earnestly recommend nn lu create of their pay. Speaking generally , this Increase nf pay should be exteudedto rotenuo officers In the customs service, such as col lectors, surveyors, naval oltlcers, and especi ally to appraisers and examiners In th ap praiser's department. Should th recommend ation to repeal the Uws granting shares ot penalties, lines aud forfeitures to public of fleers be adopted, it will be necessary to lu crease the salaries of collectors, naval oltlcers andsurteyors at all the principal ports of the country. It Is n plain truth that th Government has no right to expect the services of competent men as appraisers and examiners at the pres ent Inadequate salaries In th larger cities they are Insufficient for the luptmtof a fam ily, and under such circumstance th Govern ment Is not without responsibility when it pi. ccs Its oltlcers In sueh a pnsition that they ar compelled to choos between dlhooenty on th one hand and penury on the other, lhe salarle of the Aaatatant 1 reaturers and their frlnclpal officer should alao be increased, and I rr substantially the sitne reasons.
