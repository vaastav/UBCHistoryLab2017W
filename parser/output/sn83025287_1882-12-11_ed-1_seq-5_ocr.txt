IIOW IT WORKS. The! millers and their organs are de nouncing and ridiculing the Farmers' Board of Trade. This is done with a view of preventing the farmers from unit ing and securing such protection; as combination- and legislation can give them. The millers point to the prices they pay and argue that they are the farmers' best friend. Prices amount to very little in comparison with the grade. Of course the millers pay mar ket prices, but they make the grade and by their facilities in shipping might be said to make tho market also, though they nominally follow Liverpool. Here is -] a sample of the grading recorded by the Pope county Press: A great dsal of fault is found by the farmers over the grading of wheat along the L. F. & D 11. K. in this county. Some of the farmers 3 claim they can da better along the lino of the I - St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba and some -, claim they cannot, so it is hard to tell exactly -. where the trouble lies. It seems to be im '■) possible for all graders to; grade alike. Some ' wheat that is graded down low at Alexandria is graded higher hera, and vice versa. There are « T some very peculiar facts alAiut j this grading of .: wheat business, that are very puzzling to some. Michael Holland, of Barsnes 1", took a load of wheat to Villard and it was graded No. 2. His brother,: Edward Holland, then took a load of .', the . same wheat to Villard, and the same buyer. graded it No. .1. So it has been every time. With"; the same wheat Michael Helloed can only get grade No. 2, but his brother Edward gets No.' 1, and the latter is doing all the hauling of wheat to market at present. Torgas Johnson, of Baw ncae, brought a lot of his wheat to the Glen wood grain house, without cleaning it, and it was graded No. 1. Thinking they would dock it less, ho cleaned the next load, and brought: it in aad it was graded ' No; ;_. E_ sells the balance, without cleaning; it..':-, ,' : It is quite natural for the farmers to be restive when they see the elevators, owned almost entirely by the millers," and the grading, the price and all handled by' an organization which has no competition. It sounds very nice to say. '"Let the farmer -/sell Lis own wheat/ 'If our. way of doing business does not suit him. he can sell or ship >it himself." ; . They know .all . the '■ 'avenues are closed ■to the small farmer. .The. man with .his •housand acres or more, may be tolerably.. adependent by finding : b_s .. own f aarket, but. the average: farmer uust market his .; - grain . from Iris ?agon at some point ad j acV at to his home nd the millers' ring have "aim completely / .t'their mercy. He iv.ust accept their erms or starve. 'At present' he is compelled to accept .. .nd the millers' ring- }; fears that the Far nets'' Board of Trp.de may form a nucleus ' ihich will chatty the programme. When 1 .he millers seized. the elevator system of Northern Mianesota they overdid the natter. -* They have good reason for fear ing that their monopoly cannot last. TTIF PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE. ' v The Tevarence which was once ' felt for! ' the presidential office, and the "respect fqr its incumbents, are felt no mora. The dignity and decency which once character ized high : officials seem to have passed away. Respect for. the office has been weakened by its later incumbents. The fussy, : passionate . maaif©stations ', of ■Johnson; the low personal favoritism and corruption 'of Grant; tho weak,' "pointless complacency of Hayes. •the low political cunning and bon -circuit htbits of Arthur, all have served to undig mify the office in the 'eyes of the people, tnd to take frem it that reverential respect i and veneration which was accorded to it in its inception and retained in the earlier stages of upright administration. The delivery of the president's message was once a greatevent. It was sought for with intense eagerness, and the wildest and most energetic exertions were put forth for its early transmission, It is worthy of j note that this year the massage of the | president caused no sensation in antici pation of its delivery, and no eager scram ble for its possession after its delivery. It was received as a conimcii matter-of-fact affair. A -demi-god like Washington, or a states man like Jefferson, or a hero like Jackson, was not on deck, but simply , "Chef" Arthur, the -mall fry accidental incumbent of a great office. His homily, setting forth the affairs of the nation, as by the constitution required, was received with indifference and neglect ful unconcern. Neither the people nor con gress look to executive fulminations for statesmanlike qualities or prescience, or patriotic, unselfish, wise and competent j advice or recommendations, unmixed with | partisan elements. The executive office is great and power- I ful, but the littleness, incompetency and j unworthiness of the later incumbents, have caused for it a decadence of that rev erence and respect which was «Ece properly felt for it. No wonder tkat large masses of the people by the wretched experience of the reverse, ardently desire to see once more a statesman of en larged views and capabilities, and patriotic national impulses in the presidential chair, instead of a mere, narrow-minded poli tician, the head of a ring, the shameless disposer of the spoils of office to partisan favorites and henchmen. . In this regard it is to be hoped that 188. will open a new .era "to the American people and that they may not only have respect for the executive office, but an incumbent of it worthy, also, of respect and confidence, for his manly character, his patriotic views, and his hon est purpose to administer the government for the welfare of the whole people, and not merely in the interest of a party.

' Telegram to the Globe, ; , Nsw Yoee, Dec. 10.—When the confer ence of the presidents and other officers of the warring railroads in the Northwest was over, President^Keep, of i the Northwestern road, who had presided, said nothing defi nite had been accomplished. According to the accounts of 'those who wore present, nothing more wis done than, to review the game ground that was gone over Friday. The Chippewa Valley road, whose transfer to the St. Paul brought the negotiations in November for peace to a sudden termina- ; tion, came up again.  President Porter, who had insisted that this was a clear -in vasion of bis territory, suggested that the road should Y, € be-,.- put: in such a position' that yi it could not be -sad to the /: injury of either the Omaha or the St. Paul system. He contended that it was a dangerous ele ment on account of the trouble. that it might be made to create. President Por tar thought that the way to avoid the per nicious influence of the Chippewa Valley was by operating: it in the joint interest of both. He left it to be determined how the obstacle should be disposed of, but he said it mns.t be removed. The St. Paul repre sentatives, it was learned, did not propose to surrender control of the road, although if the Omaha wanted to send busi ness over it would make a traffic arrange ment with it. The question of territorial rights could not be dislodged from the position in which it bad been placed. President Porter took his old ground throughout regarding it, bat the St. Paul was not inclined to yield him the right to build alone in the country that he main tained belonged, natura'ly to his system. The way the aim's territory was map ped out in the conference was by taking the Wisconsin Central railroad, which runs down through the center of Wiscon sin as the dividing line. President Porter was willing to concede the St. Paul that part of the state east of the Wisconsin Central, but he claimed, for the protec tion of his own system, that part west of it. The Mississippi and St. [__ Croix rivers marked the western . limit of what' was looked upon as the Omaha's exclusive territory. There were no concessions on either side, and when the conference adjourned no progress had been made. -| The appointment of a committee com posed of the, managers of the road, except' j President Porter, created the impression. that an etfort would be made to prepare a plan for settlement on a tariff basis, leav- , ing out the territorial question altogether; or making it a subject of • arbitration. Later in the afternoon it was understood that the St. Paul contemplated extending the eastern arm of the - Chippewa Valley up from Eau Clare through the very heart of the territory claimed by the Omaha- No pledge could be secured from the St. Paul representatives not ; to make tho extension, and the Chippewa Valley proved the principal subject of dis cussion. President Porter was as resolute when the meetings were over as before, ; and reported that territorial rights could alone be the basis of settlement. Vice President Hnghitt said to-night that there were no new phases in the mat ter and that the general situation was un changed. There were a good many speculators at the Windsor last night, and nearly every" one had a different story about the war. : One had it that a settlement had been reached, and .other that the break was as wide as ever. On account of tha con-., flicting reports, the difficulty came to be "known as the Northwestern conundrum. The question of territorial rights is comparatively a new one, and it formed a general subject of discussion to day in its application to the railroad in which it has been made a prominent fea ture. . YYi''Y% tY?YYyY-.Y''< I/.'/; Alexander Mitchell, president of the St. Paul, said what had been termed territorial rights might be innocent or harmful. It was true that a road had no right to build, where there was no business for it, but he denied the privilege of one line to say that another shall restrict itself to any particu lar limits. . -..•• y Julius Wadsworth, vice president of the St. Paul, said that Mr. Porters demand for an establishment of territorial rights would be disregarded in a settlement. The St. Paul wou'd not put itself on record as binding itself not to build above Eau Claire. The settlement must be made in another way. While the Chippewa Valley line could not be given up, the St. Paul would be glad to do business for the Omaha under a traffic agreement. It was always ready to take all the business that came to it, and the more the better. Mr. T. Millbank. a director of the St. Paul, took the same ground as President Mitchell and Vice-President , Wadsworth. He said it was idle to suppose that territo- ' rial rights, as they were denominat.d,would be embodied in any settlement that might take place. : jiy 5 Hugh Riddle, president of the! Rock Is land road,' belie that. the country on either side of the line for. a , reasonable distance belonged morally to that road.' If it performed its duties, the ' road which . invaded its line would be . encroaching j on its rights. A town might - have f one line and urge projectors to build another one to the same place, in hopes they would se cure the benefit of cheap rates by leason of competition. For 200 "miles east from Council Bluffs the Rock Island was paral leled by the St. Paul, 1 and the ; two roads ran close together much of the way. There was no need of the St. Paul building where ■ it '■ did. The Rock Island was certainly able to do the business. Tae. invasion in this instance was clear through. . H. H. Porter, president of \ the Om-pi-i road, as he said before, that to build wj pre the railroad facilities were. already tiiiffi cient, was ruinous and reckless. There would not be profit enough for . both, and everyone knew that one good railroad • was far better than two poor * 4 ones. ; Mr. Porter declared that a railroad should not take a portion of the country to itself without supplying adequate facilities.'' He pointed % out';',' on -a ; map:,: : way, he y believed /•/ that ' portion of ; Wis consin west of the Wisconsin railroad tught to be considered the territory of his \ oad, and ougjjt not to have been invaded >y the St.' Paul. Mr. Por ter said •if•. he :ould see anything unreasonable in his de- _ nands he would not v,ress ; them. The lecessity of pooling the business to keep /he peace was a thing to avoid. If there vere no compeh'n^ lines, pools to keep up ; the rates and jjresent war would hot be necessary, and. peace would be . perpetual. ] His company was ready at all; times :to I build roads wherever needed in the terri- 1 tory indicated. 

SHE'S SICE, SOT NAUGHTY. The Latest Phase 'of the Langtry Advert Is- C .. ins Sc •iudal--llcr Manager Declares - Her i Conduct lias Been Severely Proper— Her { Alleged Liaison in England a Fiction of the Imagination. . V' . :.,. [Special Telegram to the Globe. J . ' . t . Boston, Dec. 10.—Mrs. Langtry has been 1 so overworked with rehearsals and constant ' performances that she is suffering greatly ' from nervous prostration, and jat the close . of the second act of "An Unequal. Match" 3 yesterday afternoon the indulgence of the audience was claimed for ten minutes. .At ; the end of that time the curtain was raised and the performance was finished as usual. Last night her nervous system was so over- ■ wrought that she had to decline all invita tions and visitors, and although she went through her part of Rosalind in "As You Like It," it was evident she was suffering greatly. She was. to have gone to the Papyrus club reception to meet tho literary men and women of the city, and a number of specially invited guests, including Gov. Long and his moth er, but; this she was compelled to forego. In regard to the interview with Mr:-. La bouchcre in Washington, Mr. Charles A. Mendnua, the acting manager of tho com pany, was seen to-night, in tho absence of Mr. Abbey and Mr. Schooffelin New York, and denied in the most unqualified terms the truth of the assertions .Mrs. La'oou chere is alleged to have made. Mrs. Lang try could not be seen, but Mr. Mendum, speaking by authority, states that tie relations between the two women were last Sunday perfectly amicable, and that, so far as Mrs. Langtry knows they still continue. They will join the company again in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the 19th inst., when a third party will be pres ent in the person of lbs. Lahgtfy'a sister, who will arrive here from England on Tuesday next, and will travel with tho company during the American tour. The story of a liaison with Baron Chetwyud is contemptuously ridiculed by Mr. Mendum, who points to the fact that Mrs. Langtry moved in the best society tn England, and was an especial favorite with the princess of Wales and other - pure women, who would never have countenanced her had there been the slightest suspicion of her. In fact she was . as - Ciesar's wife should have been, but was not wholly above suspicion. Had there been anything of the kind it must have be come known, and Mr. Abbey would never nave speculated in the success of a good ameteur ' actress who was weighted with a bad record. Her -relations with her husband and family have always been of tho most happy character, and this alone tends to disprove the statement. It is admitted that she has not acted here with as much caution as the average American woman would do, but from her st mdpoint as an English actress she has not tres passed the bounds of pro priety. In London it is considered the correct thing for an actress to receive attentions from admirers of their ability or beauty, and while following that custom here she baa in no manner overstepped the linii drawn by all virtuous women. Mr. Qibhardt has followed her, has shown his admiration for her in the most open man ner, has'put up at the same hotel, which, of course, he had a right to do, ana last night he returned to - New York. Further than an openly expressed homage, he has not gone. The theater people claim that her financial success here has been very great, and that the present week's receipts will reach §15.000. y/C- : ._ ! : THE

MATERNAL CRUELTY. A Little Child Buffering from Small-Vox- Drircn from Home I>lJ Its Heartless Motiirr. :?-;.- A brutal case of abandonment and cruel ty was brought to light on the Sth inst. by the discovery of a child, suffering with small-pox and nearly frozen, lying in an open yard of a house in Soeth Baltimore. The case was discovered early in the morn ing by the inmates of yard No. 2G2 Ham burg street, in whose house the child, Su san Green, aged nine year-, was found. It was at once reported to the health of fice, and Inspector Brown was dispatched to th 9 scene. Upon entering the yard he en countered a pitiable spectacle. Lying; prone npon its back was the little sufferer, \ nearly naked, its only covering being a j few filthy rags. The ground was frozen j hard, while under and around the child there were several pools of wa'er, which were covered with ice. The child wis be numbed by the intense cold and unable, to utter a word when' placed in the ambu lance and removed to the quarantine hos pital. Upon inquiry it , was learned that the mother of the child, who lives in the neighborhood, upon discovering last night that the child had the small-pox at once sent her out in the cold to find a shelter wherever she could, and it is thought" the child wandered about until be numbed by the cold. She entered the yard to seek refuge, and, fearing to ask admis sion to the house, fainted from exposure. The mother, upon being told of the' case, remarked that she had "no time to fool with her"; that she had a "place out .at ser vice which paid her better than looking after a child with small-pox."

If they voted at all they would vote for Mr. Com- , stock's opponent, and-a scheme to keep them away from the polia had worried Mr. Comfort _, for some time.. h.

' went - to ': the camp ? and announced a ' grand feast to take place the night before ! election and at some distance from - their 1 place. u The roast dog touched a .tender < chord in the savage breast, and the thirty- j six Indians went in a body to the * scene of < the feist.

V [Philadelphia Record.] The next vital question to divide politi cal * parties in this country, says Asst. United States Arty. Gen..Ker', will be the £ expediency of•; annexing Mexico. ; In com parison with the importance of this subject {; he declares that the disputes on questions of civil-service reform, internal revenue, and I the tariff laws will sink into insignifianco. At present Mr. Ker can see no vital ques- i tion dividing the ; Republican Ittd > Demo cratic parties, and it is this absence ,of a { bone of contention that will hasten a dis- ' pute. But the leading cause to bring about this result is the increasing commer cial interest ' takan by Americans, in Mexican affairs. The • investment of American capital in Mexican railroads ■ has already awakened an interest among i business men in the affairs of that country, and Mr. Ker expects to see .leading com mercial men from the Northern states en gage in active trade with the people across the border. The resources of Mexico have only recently become known to the .people of this country. Mr. Ker believes our financial interest in that country will ulti mately lead to a demand for its annexa tion. ,* , . .-..,, 1( »... '.- ■ * It is not on business interests alone that the lawyer depends I for tho fulfillment of his prophecy. He declares that the history of the republic, clearly shows a' course of aggrandizement that can nctl be ' cheeked until the American flag floats over every square mile of territory in North America. This national idea, Mr. Ker, declares, has been the guiding star of every, administration ' since "Washington" was president, and, as illustrations of this he cites tho acquisition of Florida, Louisiana, Texas, California and Alaska from the Spanish, French, Mexican 'and Russian governments. Again, Mr. Ker depends upon the spirit of discontent which a quar ter century cf peace will breed among the masses to work a sentiment m favor of war. Population is now increasing so Illy become known to the people ountry. Mr. Ker believes our at.ress in that country will ulti d to a demand for its annexa on business interests alone that depends for the fulfillment of <cy. He declares that the history übiifj clearly shows a course of oment that can no% be checked American flag floats over every le of territory in North America. anal idea, Mr. Ker declares, has j guiding star of every ation since Washington was r.nd, as illustrations of this he j equisition of Florida, Louisiana, i llifomia and Alaska from the French, Mexican an_ Russian nts.

Theex seoretary's intervention in the Chili-Peru controversy is cited as a proof of his earnestness in the ques tion. t's is declared to have been the first step in a plan for embroiling the gov ernment m hostilities with the j two South Ameri.an republics in order to make American influence paramount on the southern continent. Once the government became engaged in war with a South American power, or should the commercial supremacy of America become established among tho South American governments, the people of this country would recognize the importance of possessing Mexico and demand he annexation of that country, ; The completion of a ship canal across the isthmus of Panama will make it im perative to the integrity of the American government that the United States should control all the country between the present . frontier and the canal. When that,, day is * reached there will be prospects of a thriving Ameri can trade in that part of South America lying along the Pacific coast, and follow ing this the American flag will be as much respected on the summits of the Andes, in the valley of the Amazon, and at the Horn a3 it is in sight of the capitol dome. -" Mr. Ker expects to see American influ ence made paramount, not only in the southerly direction, but in the north also, as Canada will be obliged in course of time to seek annexation for protection. It is impossible, he says, for a weak and iso lated people, like the Canadians will be after separation from England, to thrive! beside a powerful nation like tho United j States, and its absorption as an integral part of the government is, therefore, im- j perative. Then will America and. the United States become coextensive. • TO -HK 

DEATH. Fat si.en tie Pawnee Terror, Killed in a Duel iii .'i Gordon Ellis in Nevada. I Paw e> 1 e.ub can.) Many cf our readers will recollect Pat She-, the boss of Di-.-k Shannon's men, who worked On a railroad throe or four miles west of town at the time it was built, j Some of our townspeople will also recol lect what _ "howly terror" 'Pat was when he. came to the city and steamed up on whisky, r and of 1" the * numerous knock downs and brawls he then engaged in. He was a big, stout, powerful man, and nearly «very one hereabouts stood in awe or took to their legs when the burly Irishman came upon a scene' where a 'knocking down and dragging out,"formed the chief features of the play. One evening, while returning home from 5 this city, he met a man driving a team near Mr. Osborn's, and fancied that the man had done him an injury in some way or other, so he concluded to settle the matter then and there by mopping the ground with the teamster. But the mop proved .to be on the other end of the stick, for the team ster stopped his horses, got out of the wagon, braced up to Pat, knocked him down, and hammered him until he -cried enough. This was .the only time Pat ever met his master in Pawnee. It seems now, however, that he has met his equal again, as well as his executioner, at Bennett's ranch, Nevada, where he and a man named Kd hammered him until he cried This was .the only time Pat ever nasier in Pawnee. It seems now, that he has met his equal again, as his executioner, at Bennett's jvada, where he and a man named mie involved in a quarrel at gambling. Ellis told Shea he would shoot him .' if ■■' he, did not , mend his ways. Shea dared him to shoot an un armed man as he was, and Ellis blazed away, sending a ball through Pat's leg be low the : knee.' "More words followed, and Ellis perforated Pat's other leg. While this was going on, some men started to camp, a short distance. away, for their rifles. Ellis, meantime, got on his horse ready to go,'but the crowd forced him to remain. Shea managed to get hold of one of i the j rifles when the men returned, and Ellis,seeing him do so, slid off his horse on the side : furthest from Shea. The latter then ; cried ' out to Ellis: ; '"Now, if you want ' to shoot at my logs any 'more, step out from behind that - horse and blaze away." §j Ellis held his position behind the h-ltt»e. ■! Shea told him he did not want to shoot the horse, but that if he did not come out at I once, and "come ' a-shootin'," he would shot the horse. Ellis saw there was no help for it, and, dodging under the horse's * head,; came: - • "a-shootin'" • sure enough, his first shot striking Shea in the groin and: ranging ■• upward. -: Shea, how ever, shot in the groin and'both; legs, re mained standing long enough to fireitwb shots'at Ellis, twe first with trifling effect, but the second:. knocking i him in death throes to the ground, Shea falling at the same instant. J Recovering, Shea rose, to a sitting postuie and called to the men, who in the meantime had rushed in, to "stand g out of '■■ the way till I.; give ' him another shot.'? ;4 The dying : man ■ hearing the re mark, whispered: "Don't let him-'shoot; I've got enough."

"What, are .your chances for United; States senator?" asked a Tribune reporter.. "I don't know." replied Mr. Hubbell; "I lave been at home sick since the election.'"' "Are; you in favor of civil service re form?" ;,;'"■' ;' *V, *Y\ "Yes, sir. I am ■' in favor of allowing 3very man to hold any office he likes, as.; long as ho likes, give him his salary as long as he wants it, and when he gets through present him with a chromo." . . "Are you going to abolish the 2 per cent. assessment schemes?".. "That assessment business was no inno vation. 5 It is an evil that has been handed, down to us from the Democrats in the days; of Jackson. Two years .ago ; I was a. bully<■ fellow when I made the assessment. 1 Then,, nobody kicked. I have caught it pretty well right and left from all sides, but time, will make all things oven." "Is Ferry going back to the senate ?.'*• P "Is Christmas going to be a pleasant"; . day?" retorted Mr. Hubbell in return. "How do you* feel on the tariff ques tion?" y "I am a protective-tariff man, but I am-, in favor of a revision of the present tariff. Everybody knows that it was instituted and adopted as a war measure, and that it. contains, many incongruities. These 1 ■ would eliminate." '.  "How do you stand on the abolishment.., of internal revenue taxation?" '•Internal-revenue taxation is not Re publican. It is an anti-Republican method of collecting revenue to support the gov ernment of a free country. It was a mat ter instituted by the necessities of the war." "Would you abolish all internal revenue* taxes?" "I would, if it could be done. But lam opposed to removing the tax on .whisky and tobacco as long as we have a. public debt and soldi. pensions to pay. It will take $125,000,00;) to pay the pen sions of the next fiscal year. If we abolish; all internal-revenue taxes we will be . obliged to have a tariff for revenue. This is undesirable. Of course the government could tax sugar, coffee, tea and the like, which would bring in all the money the government would need to support if. But as long as we have a debt we will have to allow the tax on whisky and tobacco to re , main." j Mr. Hubbell left for Washington last, night.
