TUCSON. PIMA COUNTY, ARIZONA TERRITORY, SATURDAY DECEMBER Ml. 188 NO. 48. The Santa Fe New Mtxican has put ca its paint, sonndid tbe "Atrocious LyiJ Frauds," whoop and charged '"0 colums deop on the works of Land CotamiMioner Sparks whom it accuses f "prostituting his high oflico and plac es of record under the guise of ofli cil authority such another lot of in WajraouB, puerile and idiotio rubbish a the subject of land grant frandp, as f'ver before in history saw tbe J'Snt of day, through the me diam of tbe publu printer. Tne bands charged relate only tothofebear on land grants of New Mexico. Tbe clings of Mr. Sparks uro claimed to be 10 t varience with any and everything Preceding them. But to an outsider to hom the animus of tbe case is not ex ly known, it is hard to tell whose ox u cored. The land grant business of Sew Mexioo has been wantonly abased ttf previous powem with whom Com Qiioner Sparks doer not seem to 1?ree, and this disagreement will, of "oaree, somewhat complicate land fitters pending the much needed inveu-S&tion. fc"oxott.v promises to b- the Held of nctive military operati icb ou tbe arrival of General Martinez, who having been appointed to the command of lbo dis trict embracing Sonorn, Sinnloa hnd Lower California, is shortly expected to leave the City of Mexico with a force of 10,000 troops of the line. Five thous and of these ii en will be brought into Sonorn nnd nuder tbe personal jupervisiou of Mai tinez an activa campaign is to be becun against both Apaches nnd Ynquis. With the latter Indians the people of Arizoon nave much sympathy, innsmuch as tbej are aaid to be a law-abiding nnd indus trious people, proud of their independ ence nnd conscious of their strength to maintain jt Bgnndt equal numbers to their own. Of their numerical strength and personal courage no cne is more familiar with than the man who now comes ngamst them. On their last up riing previous to tbo present one, Gen. Martinez commanded the opposing force and eventually concluded 'a peace "which remained --' i--ta till within a year! Bgo whtn i Yaqui. r?r dm b outiHge, to ain do battle for their hornets. Peace with the Yaqms and Bn active campaign ngamst the Apaches woci I be a boon to Snora. It is, therefore, to b-hoped that theAnch- es and not tbeTequis will be made to feel tbe force "f tbe pending blow. Murti tinez is "aid to be both cipablo Hnd too- ular, and decisive results maybeni- ticipnted from bis Appointment. I e will have 7000 men at his command iu Sonora alone, and if tbise be diiecled against the Apaches, they will bo driven from their Sitrra Madre btrongboldh and compelled to make peace or die the latter is ii devontrdly to be wi-I.ed.

But the people had good reason to believe thiit indictable offences bad been committed by crrtum members of said legislature uud it wa upon tlu-ro offences the people, through tbo grand jury, looked fr tight. If tbe actions of tbe legislators ia question have been misjudged, it was the duty of tbe grand jury to bet them unght, and n wrong, enforce the law against them without fear or favor to any one.

Benson, a prominen; land survejorof this city, has bis office. He was visited this morning by Cha. W. Brown, ulo a land surveyor, with whom be has bad businsss relations of late in surveying contract if. A di'pnte arose over the final cial part of tbeburineis, and this led to hot words and it is be lieved to mutual recriminations. SuJ ilenlv Brown drew a revolver and fired two Ebots ut Benson, both ot which took effect in different portions ot his head nnd caused bim to reel nud fall. Brown, believing bo bad ended Benson's life, then placed tho revolver to bis own bend and fired, but death not immediately ensuing ho seized n sharp edged paper knife ly ing within reach nnd jabbed it into bis throat and died within a few moments. From tho appe.iranco ot tbo wound he must have turned tbe knife after it entored the llesli ns the juugu Inr vein was completely f-evered und the edges of the wound were verr ragged.

Benson replied that be was busy, and arose to go out. When be reached tho door of his office he half turned around to further excu-o himself for leaving so unceremoniously, when Brown drew a revolver and without bay ing a word, fired. Tb ball rtrcck Ben son on tbe left cheek. Brown fired ngain. taking effect in the neck. Thi" wound gave rise to the belief that Ben sou's throat had been cut, as he wa? breeding profusely when found. Brown then turned the revolver on himself and fired three shots, but realizing that be bad not killed himself he seized a large paper cutter lyiog on the derk and furi ously thrust it into his neck. The blow was so well aimed and with such force that it passed almost through and severed the jugular vein. He dropped to tbe floor alongside of bis victim and in n tew minutes bled to death. A police man who happened to be near tbe door of J. C, Flood's office, tho bonanzt. million aire, heard tbe phots ncd rushed to Ben sou's office bnt too late to prevent far ther mischief. No word or sign ot life could be ext-MCted from Brcwn who w(.s then in tbe last agonies of death.

It this is satisfactory to the owners of tbe mine, Messrs, Wright & Lsyne, another hundred tons will be sent in at once.

Tho aggregate amouut of Court expenses paid during the year was $2,874,733. Tbe Attorney-General suggests tbo ad visability of building jailn at each place in tho country where United States Courts are held, and tho necessity of thi building of a government penitenti ary, where nil persous convicted of of fenses against the United States could be confined, is strongly urged. Such convicts, ho says, could bo employed in tbe manufacture of supplies exclusively for the Government, which work would ussist in malting tbe institution self- wustaining. Ho nIo suggests tho pro priety ot erectiugt n grounds adjoining the Department of Justice n proper onildiug for tin accommodation, in ad dition to that Department, ot the Su preme .Court and other proper Courts Commissions of the United States. Tho Attorney-General makes a num ber of other recommendations, nmong wbich nro the following: lh.it tbe feed ot Marshals iu Moutnna, ldubo and Wyoming be doubled; that tbe salaried if Marshals be revised; that the com pensation ot United States Attorneys for New Mexico anu Arizona bo in- creas d, and thnt the compensation ot clerks of tho Unitetl States J'ourtsia California, be reduced, tbut Attorneys und Alurfcuala bo rvqmred to make re turns by fi-cal instead ot cal endar years; that tho accounts if tho Clref Supervisors of Elec tion be taken into open court, under the inspection of the Ditrict At torney; thnt the penalty for tho punish ment of persons resisting officers ba made moro severe; that increased pro visions bt made for tho protection of United Stntes witnet-ses, and that a suit able United States Jail be built at Fort Smith, Arkansas. Tbo re h ort closes with a brief state ment ot tho Union Puc'fic Railway liti gation, and says n motion will bo filed by the Government in tbo Snpreme Court in a few days to advance the np peals on tho docket, in order to buy a a speedy determination of tbem.
