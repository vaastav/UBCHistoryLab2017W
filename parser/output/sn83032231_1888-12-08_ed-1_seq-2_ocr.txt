As U Democratic State Convention at AIImUwb In 1887, when Hn. W. M. IUp rtr vm among tlio leading candidates for 3 ait of tbt Bnpremo Court, tlicro was a sirens content made for the nomination. Ctmeraiiman Scott carried Ilia day for kl faTorlto. J. Ron Thompson, of Etlc, ad in tha list of eight distinguished men Xt. Rapihar then stood third highest-a few said ha was fourth. Bat bo this as It ay. It Is certain that this year Mr. Rap Aw could have easily tuado tlio nomination as u his former competitors were out of tha race. Thar were no candidates this jtar except Jiidse McCullom, of Susque hanna caunty, and he was not anxious for tha nomination. Tha chances of being elected were, of course, Terr allm. But had Mr. Bapsher taken the nomination ha tfonli to-day be Judge elect of the Supreme Caurt of fennsylranla, because soon after tka aamlnatlon was made, one of tlio Jndfea of the Bupreme Court (Judge Trun key) auddenly died. Tnls left two vacan clae ta be filled, and the new constitution mlitn In nrh rami that both the Demo- otitic and Keoubllcan candidates should be par excellence, elactai. That Is.tbat each toter could vote far only one candidate. Judges McCullom end Mitchell will therefore both take their Mtt on tha Supreme Bench on the first JfoBday of January next. This would kara been a- nlca plum for our former twfltman, If lie had been In the field as a (.ndldtte, as the salary Is 8,000 a year amd mlleage.and tha term twenty-one years. Out foreign relations are disposed of by tlio statement that all pending difficulties are capable of satisfactory adjustment. Nothing Is added to the expressions of former messages respecting Canadian or British questions, excepting with regard to Lord Sackvllle'a "unpardonable conduct In his Interference with tne suffrage of Ameri can citizens and Ills subsequent public de clarations Impugning tlio Executlvoand Senate of the United Stttes, In connection with Important questions now pending In controversy between the two govern ments." A revision of the naturalization and pass port laws so as to glvo nioro perfect pro tection to citizens abroad, while preventing abuse of the privileges of citizenship, and "such a reorganization of the consular fee service as will abolish perquisites,'' are additional sucgcstlons not specifically Itv eluded In departmental reports already published.' loved his girl wife and taking a cozy flat the two lived like a couple of turtle doves. lie took no noto of his family's displeasure, and so threo happy years rolled swiftly away. BROADBRIM'S N. Y. LETTER. Qtrm a. ituudeb of oun kiciunoes ttke a particular delight In denouncing the Xnlghta of Labor and Grand Master Work nan Powderly, but when they- are asked to explain their grlavlanccs It Is wonderful to abaart the manner In which they equivo cate, deliberately falsify and attempt to tttilaad tbelr readers. True, tha Knights f Labor organization Is not perfect; It would ba impossible to have kept an order which angumented so rapidly In members amongst all classes' during a few months In i parfeet state of harmony; thoy have made mistakes, also, bnt It was brought about b tke hasty judgment of hot beads and not by tha calm, deliberative helm, T. V. Powder- Ijrj yes, the organization has decreased In s rubers: nobody ever doubted that It trenld not, its growth was tao rapid for it wn food, but no one will dispute the Ad YOOA.TB in saying that with 290,000 con (rvatlva, honest and patriotic members Ik arganlzatton is far better off than with a nambershlp twice as large, one-half of whom might be anarchists and of kindred Strip. Regardless of the fact that their Membership has decreased, and of the mis take made, the Knights have progressed tkay have profited through eriors of the $ut, and bavobeen placed on a more sub stantial footing by purging their ranks of tha unfaithful. Tea, there is a great future for thla labor organization. Two singular lawsuits took place hero this week, very unique in character, In one caso the son sues his father for stealing, and in the other the father attaches his son's property for debt. John R. Andrews, or Jack Andrews as ho was farmlliarly known about town, was one of the best knowu brokers In New York, A clubman first ntgbtcr always, lover of good things and good fellows, and a general howling swell, Jack floated along on the surface rf society, enjoying all of Its sweets and escaping more of Its sours than any fellow within my ken. A member of a popular firm of Wall street brokers, with a seat worth twenty-five thousand dollars in the Stock Exchange, he zathered In his shekels In the way of commissions sufllcl ent for all of his earthly wants with a fow dollars to spare for a needy friend, for Jack's purso strings were never drawn when any of bjs chums were a little short. Besides bis commissions Jack occasional! took a Utile flyer on his own account, an bo had somo outside business ventures just to keep the pot a bllln'. Among other speculations he took some stock iu Tiffany & Co.'s, the great jewelers, to the amount' of two hundred thousand dollars, and be' lng short fifty thousands he raised it from his father, giving as security certificates ot Tiffany stock to the amount of one nun dred thousand dollars. After a time Jack called upon his father and asked him to let him liaye the hundred thousand dollar cer HEWS OUT BP. Tha Country Over- Bomathtng for Haity Kad ers to Freeze Onto. Tho Schuylkill county commissioners One bright afternoon ten can Ago , hRVB(jtfprcj ft rpwaril of S2,.100 for the ar- ho stepped out of his house, kissing his young wife at the doorstep, and from lhav time till a week ago he might have been sunk in tho sea. In a few weeks the girl wife suddenly disappeared, and tbo neigh bors all said that In a fit of desperation at losing her husband she had made away with herself, and In. a short time the pair were entirely forgotten, Last week a well known lawjer called on a gentleman oc cupying a comfortable position It) the Ei le railroad offices, and asked him It ho was not tho man who had deserted his wife ten years bcfoie, and being confronted with the proofs be admitted that ho was. In the meantime ho had married again and was the father of four children. Tbo .lawyer asked him how he came to marry havlug another wife living, but he Informed his questioner tbat his wife was dead and that he had tho Information from her sister, In whoso arms sbo died in New Orleans live orslx years before. The lawyer appeared satisfied but asked him to meet him at his olllce next day when be broucht him and his first wifo faco to face. The husband Was thunderstruck; his second wife was lost to him and his children might be de clared Illegitimate, lie begged for mercy, but the wire was in no merciful mood and threatened to land him in State's l'll&on for bigamy. At last It was agreed that lie should pay her fivo dollars a week, the money to bescnt to the General Post Office, as tho first wife refused to- gtye her address or to tell anything about herself. The money was paid foi several weeks and 'hen the husband shadowed her with detectives, and after a long hunt found her lit lng with u lawyer who was once a friend of his, and who has been passing bfcr ns bis wife for the last eight j ears. The couple were liv ing In excellent style and the freak that took possession of the deserted wife appears to have been of revenge at finding her former husband so happy with another affinity, though she bad consoled herself by taking another husband. As It looks now she will be lucky If she escapes States Prison for bigamy herself, the only thing that can save her Is the absenco of the second marriage certificate and of that there appears to be somo doubt. It is with pride and pleasure that I record that this week we have been honored on tbo presence of that aristocratic pug "the rest and conviction of tho mnrdcrcr of Bernard Jfct.afferty, of Mnhonoy City. A similar rewHid Is offered for the apprehen sion of the murderer of George Haines, of St. Clair, Thecfilcersnic still without a clue as to tho perpetrators of cither deed.

This should bo pre sented ta thCountyCommlslners Immedi ately upon the report being declared abso lute!; it may haye, such a direct bearing on that body as to produce the most favor able results. Tha Lehigh brldgo Is certain ly sot safe; to thoroughly repair It will cost Several thousand dollars, and even then It trill be an old concern and soon require more patchln?, until within a few years the old atractura will require as much for aeemary repaln as a substantial new bridg will cost. Of course, the Com tnbulonera understand this, as well as do tk people, so argument Is unnecessary. It vax n souEWHAT onATiryisa to stay Democrats to know that though Graver Cleveland was defeated for the Pre- aldeaey on the Otb of November, yet never theless he has a popular majority oyer Banjamla Harrlsan of 70,000 to 80,000. Xarriion carried twenty states out of tne tklrty-elght. This being the case it Is not ValUikjely that the present agitation of letlag the President by the popular yote vlll amount te more than a bubble with our mew Republican government. THE 

PRESIDENT MESSAGE. la his communication to Congress one year ago Prasldant Cleveland devoted more jpe to a tingle feature than bo now gives to all the subjects to which he directs the ttttntlon of Congress. The tariff and sur pins are now disposed of In about a column vhlle tha entire message occupies nearly eight columns. Respecting tariff,. Mr. Cleveland docs not asedlfy hi proposition of last December. or do ha see in the result of the late election reason to despair of the ultimate triumph of the principles he champions. HI views are tersely summarized in this xpratsisn: The cause for which the battle is waged 1 eamprlsed within lines clearly and dis tinctly defined. It should never be com promised. It Is tba people's causa, Thl declaration Is followed b.r a rebuke t the spirit af paternalism which "would sake the general Government the fountain af Individual and private aid," and would dispense with "the usual rules and Umlta tlaa ot business principles and just dealing S agalnit th Goyernment and In favor of jrlvata claim." The President enters a Strang protest against tha Idea that claims should ba allowed that are "supported b a better consideration than the wealth of tba Government and the poverty of the claimant," and he Insist tbat publlr need tad necessities should be the criterion of expenditure on public buildings and other faiproveraent.

Fortunately be can stand It vitbout being hurt, but the whole story Is a beautiful Illustration of that homely adage, "with a twist, "Uring & child up in the way he should go, and when ho grows old ho'll go it." The other case was of a young hopeful who tried to beat his father out of his board, but there were no flies ou" the old gentleman and he wouldn't have it. The boy, who was only eighteen years old, had spent all bis'spare change on a swell over coat, and he Informed the old mm that he must hang up the board bill. Tho old man seized the overcoat and locked It up, swearing by the big boot that ho should not wear It till be paid his board. Straight way young hopeful went to tho Court and swore out a warrant for the kreeuy of his coat. He did not mention to the presiding judge that tho criminal was his father. You can hardly conceive the judge's amaze ment when ho discovered who the accused was. The case was at once dismissed, and the sitting magistrate would have sent the young scamp up for ten years If he had had jurisdiction In the case; as It was, he gave him such a raking down that I hardly think he will ever try that experiment again. This week a lunch took place here which promises to work a complete revolution, In ocean navigation, and If the claims ot the Inventors of the machinery in the new vessel are to bo believed we may expect to seo ships dashing across the ocean with the speed of a railroad train, and tin ee days be tween here and Liverpool will be consid ered ordinary schedule time. The Eureka was built as an experiment, the new power being gas with a mixture of common air exploded by electricity directly against the water thereby doing away with paddles or propellers, and bavlng a power more con trolable aud far less .dangerous than steam Tbo only fire used Is for vaporizing tho pet roleum out of which the gas is made, and tnls supply of fuel only occupies a vury small portion of the vessel.

I looked over one and found llui two entire pages were given over to prize fight ers, horse races aud walking matches, the Utter entertainment belug tne only proper Item of Sunday news, for just as tbn clock ituck twelve on Sunday night about twenty podestrain toughs began that dreary per formance called a walking match, and for six days thereafter the aforesaid loughs will plod, and plod, and plod to the las., strain of human endurance, aud when tbelr legs are swollen and tbelr bodies are sore some pickpocket or prize fisbting pug will be called upon to award them the co-called champion's belt which, six weeks after, you may expect to see adorning the bar of some low groggery or In a pawnbroker's window in the Uowcry. We have had many of these exhibitions tn this city in the past few years, and they have always been a shame and disgrace. They bring together tho very vilest class of the community, and on the last two days you can generally find there the principal thieves, gamblers and harlots In the city. In the paper spoken of t'.iere were about twenty lines on cnurch matter and one half of a column glylng iu full Charley-Mitchell's challenge to Jack Dempiey, and another halt of a column coat and regulation white choker this noble scion of ancient ancestry, in company with the Hon.
