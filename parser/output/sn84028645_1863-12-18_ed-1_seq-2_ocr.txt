The Fight at Bear Station, Tenn. ' On' the afternoon of Monday, the 14th Inst, there was a fight at Bear Station, Tennessee, between our cavalry under Gen eral SlIACKLEFORD and 

LONGSTKEKT, in Which our loss was about seventy-five. Our forces were driven back half a mile. The fight was expected to be renewed the next day. Bear Station is north of the Hobtten river, twenty-five miles south ot feumberlaud Gap, and forty-five miles north- west from Knoxvillc, and twenty-five miles southwest from Rogersville, at which place are Longstreet's headquarters. The aim of the rebel General was to capture Shacklkford, and to this end he crossed a force to the south side of the ITolsten river, which proceeded westward and attempted to re-cross in our rear west of Bear Station. In this, however, they were defeated. The two rebel rams, which have been built at Liverpool by Laiud,- and the one under construction at Glasgow, have been sold by the Confederate agents to the British Government, The money, which will not be far from $2,000,000, w ill be pocketed by the agents, and the British creditors who advanced the money to complete these war ships will be left without a dollar of their investment. Death of Mrs. G. W. McCook. , Mrs. MoCook, wife of Col. George W. McCook, of Steubenvllle, died on Thurs day, Dec. 10th. She was most highly es teemed by all her friends and acquain tances, as a consistent Christian, as an af fectionate Mother, as a devoted Wife, and as a true Woman. We tender our sorrowing sympathy to the bereaved Husband and other kindred of the deceased, who alone can know how great is the loss they have sustained by this afflictive dispensation ol Providence. Commissioner Meredith. Tlie Cincinnati Gazette has a special dis patch dated Washington, Dec. ICtli, which says: .. - ' Some Westers! gentlemen, t om.crti il iih the Sanitary (.oiniiii-.-ini,, vuitt-d on tin President to-day and represented tt at tin- refusal of the rebels to exchange i.risouers was as much owing to the mismanagement as from any othercause. They represented his habits as being bad, and also described him as petulant and overbearing, and con sequently having brought on his personal aitlicuities witn uiua ny nis own conduct,. It is a curious circumstance, says the World, that the statue of Liberty, which has just been nnvailed on the top of the Capitol at Washington, represents a colored woman! For fear of discoloration, the excuse is, an acid has been employed, which stains the surface of the figure, and thus makes the color weather-proof. It is perhaps fit that tlie present piebald Congress and Cabinet, whose only thought is the negro, should be surmounted by a mulatto figure of Liberty; but as soon as the whitelpeople's friends are in a majority in Congress, we shall insist upon a white figure of Liberty, or else none at all. A crazy Abolition correspondent ol the' New York Tribune expresses himscli delighted 'with the statue, and to cap the climax, claims that a negro slave did most 6f the -work upon it. ."Why in the world," exclaimed the Lord Mayor of London, during the Gordon riots, to the Roman Catholic gentlemen who sought his protection from mob violence, "why in the world will you be Catholics? Why don't you turn Protestants and then the mob wouldn't burn your houses." Nothing could be simpler. The South is fighting, because it believed, falsely, as we claim, its Institutions to be in danger. "Give up your , institutions," : cries Mr. Lincoln, "and there will be no danger of their being interfered with." It is stated that the official report of Gen. McClellas of his military campaigns of j 1861-2 is among the documents communi cated to Congress by the Secretary of War, and is now in the Government printing of- flca. As it is quite voluminous it will re quire several weeks to print it Senator Male has introduced a bill "to suppress the rebellion." If the rebellion can be suppressed by act of Congress, and the war ended, let a bill for that purpose be put through, as the soldiers say, "on the double-quick.",', ". ; The President's message contains eight tnousanu woras, ana emoouies, , says an ea8tern WW, one idea. It does not require a Yankee to guess what that one Idea is. ' ' H.C.C.

[From the Louisville Journal.] ' The fact that the rebellion is the joint work of tiieAboiltiouistsand the Secession ists has been proclaimed, sometimes by Ab olitionists, sometimes by Secessionists, and snriiet lmpa bv the enemies of both. The annual message of Gov.Bramlette furnishes an Instance of the latter kind. Tho vicious .ambition , of the Southern men," says the Governor, "and the bigoted fanaticism of the men or tne JNortn, in giving anu accept ing a sectional ptiarrel about a local insti tution, have forced upon us the most ground less, cruel, wicked, inexcusable warfare that ever afflicted any people of the earth." But the same truth has just be proclaimed by one of the parties themselves. The other day, at Philadelphia, on tho "anniversary oi the third decade of the American Ati Slavery Society," at which nearly all the shining lights of Abolitionism of these tliiry vpara of tlm slnverv agitation were assem bled, William Lloyd Garrison, President of tne society, made tne opening speccn. m the course of his sneech. he said, and lie said exultingly, that upon this question of slavery "tne iire-eatcrs oi inc boum uuu uie abolitionists of the North had had one bond of union;" thnt "tho latter undertook to kindle the Northern heart, forgetting that they would also lire the Southern heart ;" and that "the former undertook to lire the Southern heart, but little thought what a tremendous firing they would give the Northern heart. The only difference was that the abolition fire was borrowed from Ilcavcn, and that of the fire-eaters from another unmentionable place." But this difference is not material, to the issue. Here, as- a contemporary says, we have the fact boastlngly presented by the head and front of the American Anti-Slavery Society that the Secessionists of the South and the Abolition fanatics of the North are the parties who may rightfully claim all the honors, such as they are, of In volving the two sections in this fearful, ex hausting and destructive civil war. The Ab olitionists of the one section produced the Secessionists in the other; the two factions thus brought out, although in antagonism to each other, commenced and continued to play Into each other's hands until they split up, on the line of slavery, several of our most extepsive church organizations; and then, after demolishing the old national Whig party, and next dividing the old national lemoeratlc party, the Secessionists plunged into this crazy rebellion, and the Aboli tionists, witli this invitation, advanced their standard to the national capital. The results are before us in the costs and consequences of this disastrous war. The Abolitionists are rejoicing over their work. They see nothing before them but the-ex-tirpation of Southern slavery, and care to see nothing else. The secessionists, with all the waste and ruin which this war has brought upon them, accepting it as a war of extermination, are lighting with the stubborness and blindness of despair. We can only watch and pray and labor for a change of measures and of men. Stoppage of Supplies to our Captive Soldiers. The wretched impolicy of the Govern ment in regard to the business of exchang ing prisoners has kept thousands' of our brave soldiers suffering in southern prisons who might easily have been set free:-. Their sufferings have been mitigated 'lately by the supplies of food and clothing which the rebel authorities have allowed us ,to send them. That privilege is now denied,: by reason of tlie falsehoods of the radical press in charging lack of good faith on the part of tne rebel authorities in the delivery or tneir supplies to our soldiers, and the shameful impolicy of our government in allowing the officer who has from tlie first muddled tlie business of exchanges to repeat this un founded imputation. The rebel authorities would have shown gwatcr magnanimity in permitting ourstip plies still to be sent' to their prisoners and refuting these slanders bv confined cure in tlicir oisfribiitio'i and ('eliverv, l'-i;f we i nvc tut right t'M'XKM-t unytliin't N'tti r'.liitn ' liiirt!-Mlii! nogei cn.sirj'.ceriit.ly--inui a b'-llicrenf.
