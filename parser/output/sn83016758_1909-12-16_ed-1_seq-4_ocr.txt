(A i !&"* THE PRINCETON UNION BY R. O. DUNN. rsRM8-S1.oo PER YEAR IN ADVANOK. 1.25 I NOT PAID IN ADVANCE. iPHOli FIRST 8T EAST OF OOURTHOUSBi (1. I. STAPLES, Bailneai Manager. Tn some respects Uncle Sam is a peculiar and inconsistent old chap. For instance: He grants licenses to sell liquor in the so-called "Indian country" and then penalizes the men who engage in the business. It is said that red ripe strawberries sold in the New York market for a dollar apiece last week. The average country editor is content if he can afford to buy red ripe apples at two for a nickel once in awhile. '^p^^^S^^f?^^ A TH05-. H. PR0W5B Bdltor. A copy of Jas. J. Hill's speech at the national corn exposition should be preserved by every farmer for reference. It is chock full of sound advice "It is surprising," says a con temporary, "that so many foreigners succeed in touching the heartstrings of our heiresses." Heartstrings? Fursestnngs would be a better word. "For the good of the service" Sam Fullerton has been severed from his job as superintendent of the state fish hatcheries. The game and fish com mission ought to have fired him years ago. Colonel Roosevelt has presumably heard a great noise issuing from Washington. At any rate he has de cided to emerge from the jungle early in the spring and to rush home before congress adjourns. A brother newspaperman says that men are better listeners than women. It is evident that he never attempted to sneak upstairs with his shoes in one hand, when he expected his wife to be sleeping, at 2 o'clock in the morning. President Taft's message tells whether or not he has lived up to his size. What do you think of the docu ment?Biwabik Times. That to "read, mark, learn and in wardly digest" it requires the con sumption of considerable time. The fellow who predicted that the Indian race is dying out has another guess coming. There are 40,000 more Indians in the United States than there were twenty years ago, and 10,000 more in Canada than there were in 1899. There are scientists and scientists, among tLem professors who fathom the depths of the ocean and the density of the atmosphere, but nature has so far been unequal to the task of producing one who can fathom the depth of a woman's mind. Franklin McVeagh, secretary of the treasury, says in effect that the Payne law is but the first incident in the great movement by the republican party toward a reduction of the tariff on necessities. Let's see. Has the Payne law reduced the tariff on neces sities, Mr. McVeagh? A number of submarine mines have been planted at the eastern entrance to Long Island sound. There's nothing like taking extraordinary precaution against any attempt at in vasion by that man Zelaya of Nicaragua, who is in an ugly mood and liable to run his one-gunboat navy up the Atlantic coast at any moment. From Washington dispatches we draw the conclusion that one of the principal reasons which caused a number of the house members to "insurge" against Speaker Cannon was the fact that he handed cone of them a chairmanship. Uncle Joe probably considered them incompetent to perform the duties of such re sponsible positions. Now comes the startling report that an old sea captain and an insurance agent were employed by Dr. Cook to fabricate the astronomical, topo graphical and other data which has been submitted to the university of Copenhagen. There is of course 'a possibility that an envious personage named Peary is responsible for this reportthat the sea dog and the insurance chap are telling stories about Cook for a consideration. President Taft has fully made up hta mind that he will hold himself aloof from the Cannon troublesthat he will steer clear of both factions. In this decision the president displays sound judgment, for there is bound to be hot times between the regulars and insurgents over the speakership question bye and bye, and were Mr. Taft to mix in it could hardly, have any other effect than that of weakening his standing. Washington, D. headquarters of the pure food people, appears to be particularly lax in its work of milk inspection. A statement has just been issued by the health department of that city to the effect that fifteen per cent of those who die in the District of Columbia from tuberculosis contract the disease from milk furnished by dairies there. The government food inspection department should practice what it preaches. They are having considerable fun at Governor Eberhart's expense down in St. Paul. It seems that on his re cent trip to Washington, somewhere in Indiana, the governor "butted in" to a pair of card sharps and had one of thern arrested for fleecing some body. The Twin City papers handle the matter very gingerly, but a whole lot of people are dying to find out the "true inwardness" of the episode in which the governor figured so promi nently. Minneapolis would probably land a greater percentage of the criminals which ply their calling in its midst were it to employ a number of news boys on its detective force. Last week two of these street urchins shadowed a couple of hold-up men who had slugged and robbed a man in an alley and, while one of the boys engaged the robbers in conversation on the topics of the day,switchmen's strike, convening of congress, etc., the other rushed off for a policeman and the highwaymen were jugged. The boys should be rewarded for their tactfulness. Talk of an appeal to the United States government is being made on behalf of an American girl, Alice Paul, who was sentenced in London to thirty days hard labor for throwing a stone through a window of the guild hall while the lord mayor's dinner was in progress. It appears that Miss Paul became affiliated with a band of virago suffragettesall London suffragettes are viragoes and threw the rock "in the interest of the cause." Why the United States government should interfere in the matter is not apparent. Such an act as that committed by Miss Paul would be tolerated by no nation and the punishment she received is by no means too severe for the crime. The Salvation army and Volunteers of America throughout the county are making preparations for their annual Christmas charitable work. In Minneapolis alone six hundred baskets loaded with chicken and other good things will be distributed among the needy poor by the Salvation army, while the Volunteers of Ameri ca will supply hundreds of poor children with toys, nuts, candies, etc., from several Christmas trees. The organisations named should receive liberal public support. They are charitable organizations in the true sense of the word and relieve more suffering and distress in one year than do all the fashionable churches in the country combined in fifty. In his opening address to the jury in the sugar trust case at New York the chief counsel for the defense, Henry F. Cochran, contended that the underweighing at the Havemeyer and Elder docks, Brooklyn, was due to bad scales and not to manipulation on the part of the checkers, that government officials were always permitted to examine the scales and could have remedied the defects had they so desired. That the scales were defective is doubtless true, but the trust was certainly aware of the de fects and manipulated its game of thievery so that the government did not discover it. How this was effected is obvious. The discharge of the government officials whose duty it was to inspect these scales tells the talea tale of(jb$.bery and Corruption. THE 

PRJJSIOBTON UNIOKf THXJB6DAY, DECEMBER 16, *ba9 ^N^% n*rjw 450. *fC%$LH' Sometime ago the St. Paul Dis patch called attention to chapter 450 of the general laws of 1909, claiming that under its provisions ten per cent of the amount received from liquor licenses in villages and cities of not more than 10,000 inhabitants must be paid into the road and bridge fund of the counties of the state. The Union of December 2 quoted the law in question which proved that the Dis patch writer was in error, that the ten per cent referred to was required to be paid into the county treasury and credited to the general revenue fund money credited to the general revenue fund cannot be utilized for roads and bridges. A host of country news papers, and the Pioneer Press of the 11th inst., editorially, endorsed the Dispatch's version and commented on the same. But owing to the bungling manner in which chapter 450 was drawn it is doubtful if.any city or village, where ten per cent of the license money is expended for roads or streets or for schools, can be re quired to pay an additional ten per cent of the license money into the county treasury. Probably it was the intent of the legislature that ten per cent of the license money should go to the county treasury, but it is alto gether likely that the courts will be called upon to interpret the law. There is a proviso attached which may be construed either way. It reads as follows: "Provided, that in case any such municipality is situated in two or more counties, then said ten per cent shall be divided pro rata among such counties but the council may appropriate any part thereof to any school district wholly or partially within such municipality for general or specific purposes. Such council may also appropriate the whole or any part thereof, to the construction or repair of roads or streets within or adjacent to, or leading from such municipality." The question" is, does the proviso refer to the ten per cent on the ninety per cent of the license money? NOT (iVIT.TY. When Bob Dunn penned the follow ing, he was probably looking back ward to state promises, political pledges, and loose jointed promises, for what else could have killed off three promising gubernatorial candi dates in Minnesota, if the following isn't true: "The republican party must live up to its promises if it has to kill the Tafts, the Aldrichs, the Cannons, or meet defeat at the polls. The people are talking. "Lake City Republican. Bob Dunn never penned the above quoted sentence and no such item ever appeared in the Union. There is nothing the matter with Taft that we are aware of for old Joe Cannon we have a great deal of respect and admirationespecially so since con gressmen and others have gone out of their way to denounce him as for Aldrichhe is a United States senator and the associate of our own Knute Nelson and Moses Clapp, and we should hate awfully to say anything that by any stretch of the imagination might be construed as a reflection upon an intimate friend of either of our worthy repre sentatives in the American house of lords. At last a competent, cultured gen tleman has been selected as head of the state agricultural college. On Tuesday the board of regents of the state university elected Prof A. F. Woods of Washington, D. to the position at a salary of $6,000 per year. Prof. Woods is at present pathologist and physiologist and assistant chief of the bureau of plant industry in the United States depart ment of agriculture. His appoint ment is hailed with delight by the friends pf the agricultural school, the most important of all the state's ed ucational institutions. It is to be sincerely hoped that never again will a political freebooter be chosen as the head of that noble school. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, national organizer of the Industrial Workers of .the World, was convicted at Spokane of conspiracy to incite a violation of the laws of the land and sentenced to serve three months in the county jail. And yet the notori ous anarchist, Emma Goldman, is permitted to travel about the country preaching assassination, arson and other crimes unmolested. boon 

ROADS A GOOD SUBJECT. Vyfj When a newspaper writer is at a loss for something to write about, the subject of good roads always comes in handy, and the number of people competent to write on the subject is legion.Elk River Star News. The Union has ever been a con sistent and persistent advocate of the cause of good roads, and as a result of its advocacy there has been con siderable improvement in the roads in this vicinityin Sherburne and Isanti counties as well as in Mille Lacs. We hold that the good roads question is the all important question in Min nesota today. All other issues are of secondax*y importance. We also maintain that our existing road laws are ineffective and should be re modeled. Township and county authorities should be required to ex pend taxes raised for road purposes in a systematic and intelligent manner under the supervision of com petent road-builders. As it is, it is no exaggeration to say that fifty per cent of the money expended on the public highways is wastedof course, there are localities where every dollar is expended to good advantage. It requires money to construct good roads. The efforts of the counties and towns must be supplemented by state aid, especially so in northern Minnesota. Under our state constitution as it is the only money available for the con struction and improvement of public highways by the state is the income derived from the internal improvement fund, five per cent of the proceeds of the sale of government lands, and .one-fourth of a one mill general tax the first two items area mere bagatelle and the tax of one-fourth of one mill is grossly inadequate, besides it is left discretionary with the legislature to levy it. The Union proposes that the next legislature shall submit an amend ment to the constitution providing for a general tax of one mill on the assessable propery of the state, the proceeds of such tax to be used in the construction and Improvement of public highways, to be expended by the counties of he state under the supervision and direction of the state highway commission. The present valuation of the state exceeds one billion dollars, and if such an amendment were adopted before it could become operative it is safe to assume that the assessable val uation of the state would be increased to $1,200,000,000. A tax of one mill on an assessable valuation of $1,200,- 000,000 would produce a revenue of $1,200,000, which would give each of the 85 counties of the state on an average over $14,000some counties would receive more and some less but the average would exceed $14,000. That amount judiciously expended, with a like amount expended by the minor political subdivisions, would give each county at least 20 miles of good permanent highways each year. That would mean 200 miles of good highways in each county of the state within a decade. The plan proposed is simple and feasible. The tax would not be onerous. The large centers of popu lation and the iron ranges, where wealth is concentrated, would pay the lion's share of the tax. By 1912, when the amendment to the constitution, if adopted, would become operative, the steel corporation alone would pay $250,000 annually, or one-fifth of the entire amount. All the talk anent conservation of the state's resources, costly waterways, etc., is largely for political effect. A system of good public highways would contribute more to the upbuilding of the state and the happiness and prosperity of its .citizens than all other agencies combined. The alpha and omega of state development can be summed up it two wordsGOOD 

ROADS. Carrie Nation is still carrying her little hatchet, or at least she carried it until arrested in Washington, D. C. for destroying fifty dollars' worth of public poison in the union depot buffet. If this country ever produced a personage so strenuous in the pursuit of a chosen calling as Sister Nation,history has no record of it. But whether she has accomplished any good by her war upon the demon rum is doubtful. Her methods savor too much of the London suffragette to effect a reform. A XlTTZJE TOO PREVIOUS. A good press agent is worth his weight in rubies to an ambitious politician, but sometimes the over zealous press agent is a little too previous. For instance, the Western Publisher of December 8, contains a two-column address which was supposed to have been delivered by Gov. Eberhart at the Sauk Center editorial meeting on the 3rd inst., when, as a matter of fact the governor was not within a hundred miles of Sauk Center on that evening. The laughable thing about it is that the governor his opening remarks tells how he thought it would be impossible for him to be with them that evening, but thanks to the courtesy o/ the Chicago committee and the railroad company he was enabled to be present present in the spirit but absent in the flesh, we presume. The address was a commonplace effort, hardly what one would expect from the pen of Ralph Wheelock qr Frank Stacy, but it would probably have sounded better from the governor's lips than it reads in cold print. HOW 

GRE4.T STATESMEN ARE 4.DE. Here in Minnesota we never know what great men we have in our midst until one of them goes away from home to read a paper before some convention or aggregation of faddists. Previous to his departure the great man, or his press agent, sees to it that each of the big dailies is supplied with a type-written copy of his speech, then when it is delivered the big dailies, under flaming headlines, pub lish the address, or a generous syn opsis of the same, as a "special tele gram" from Washington or Podunk, with a fulsome introductory telling how our great man captivated the convention or aggregation, and of the deafening applause that greeted his remarks. An alert press agent and the big daily papers with their "special dispatches" can make a statesman out of an exceedingly small bore politician. Secretary Wilson fids that local meat marketscomputed from in quiries made in fifty citiesadd 38 per cent to the price paid by them to the wholesalers. But Mr. Wilson fails to say what percentage the meat trust adds to the amount it pays the farmers for the cattle. It is a safe guess that 100 per cent is a low esti mate. Anent the Fort Wayne Poker Experience. The governor was a little lamb His fleece was white as snow There's nothing in this poker yarn Ralph Wheelock tells us so. Quentin in Minneapolis Tribune NEWSPAPERDOM The Akeley Herald-Tribune sus tained a $3,000 fire on Wednesday of last week. The composing room and its contents were burned and the press room was damaged. Rush City's old reliable paper, the Post, has turned its thirty-fourth milestone, and modestly announces that, "it will continue as a presistent booster for Rush City." May genial, brave old Col. Stone and his amiable and gifted wife continue at their post on the scintillating Post for many years to come. Arthur W. Sheets, for thirty-four years publisher of the Todd County Argus, after a lingering illness, died at his home in Long Prairie on the 8th inst. Mr. Sheets was a native of Indiana and was born October 9, 1851 he came to Todd county with his parents in 1871, and in 1876, in com pany with his brother, Hon. J. H. Sheets, established the Argus, and was continuously identified with "the paper until his death. Mr. Sheets was an able and conscientious editor and made the Argus a model country newspaper. Pioneer Printer Dead Martin J. Clum, a pioneer printer and veteran of the civil watf died on Tuesday afternoon in Highwood, St. Paul. He came to St. Paul in 1852, worked on the old St. Paul Pioneer, and later, with T. M. Newsom and J. B. H. Mitchell, founded the St. Paul Daily Times. Enlisting in the Second Minnesota, Mr. Clum followed the regiment through the battle's of Mill Springs, Pittsburg Landing and other engagements. In 1862 Clum was mus tered out pn account of disease. He returned to St. Paul and resumed work on the St. Paul Press. Mr. Clum was born in Troy, N. Y., in 1833, and before going to St. Paul was employed on the Troy Times. Mrs. Clum and four children survive. W 5$?8J *^#fv*
