AT DAMASCUS JDr. Talmaa'0 Describes Soeaea In and -A. bout tha Renowned Olty, miTlnol Ib bis eleven tb seinon on the Holy Land, preached lately at Brooklyn. Rer. T.

In Palestine we spent last nfg-bt In a mud horel of one story, but camels and sheep in the basement. Yet never did the most brilliant hotel on any conti nent seem so attractive to me as that tructure. If we had been obliged to tey in tent, as we expected to do that night we must have perished. A vio lent storm had opened upon us its vol leys of ball, and snow, and rain, and wind, as if to let us know what the Hi ble means when prophet, and evangel ist and Christ himself spoke of the fury cf the elements. The atmospheric wrath broke upon us about one o'clock in the afternoon and we were until night exposed to it With hands and feet benumbed, and our bodies chilled to the bone, we made our slow way. As the night approached, the tempest thickened and blackened and strength ened. Some of our attendants going ahead bad gained permission for us to bait for the night in the mud hovel I speak of. But the torn post ceased dur iug the night, and before it was fully day we were feeling for the stirrups of our saddled horses, this being the day whose long march will bring us to that city whose name can not be pronounced In the hearing of tho intelligent or the Christian without making the blood to Single and the nerves to thrill and put ting the best emotions of the soul into avgltatton Damascus I During the day we passed Ceesarea Phillppl, the northern terminus of Christ's journeying North of that be never went. We lunch at noon, seated on the fallen columns of one of II o rod's palaces. At four o'clock in the afternoon, com ing to a bill-top, we saw on the broad plain a city, which tho most famous camel', driver' of all time, afterward called Mohammed, tho prophet and the founder of the most stupendous system of error that has ever cursed the earth, refused to enter because he said God would not allow man to enter but one paradise and be would not enter this earthly paradise lest be should be de nied entrance to the heavonly. But no city that I ever saw so plays bide and seek with the travelor. The air is so clear the distant objects seem close by. You come on the top of a hill and Da mascus seems only a llttlo way off. But down you go into a valley and you see nothing for the next half hour but bar renness and rocks regurgitated by the votoanoes of other ages. Up another hill and down again. Up again and down again. But after your patience Is almost exhausted you reach the last hill top and the city of Damascus,, the old est city under the whole heavens, and built by Noah's grandson, grows upon your vision. This is the very road, for it has been the only road for thousands of years, the road from Jerusalem to Damascus, along which a cavalcade of mounted of ficers went, and 1810 years ago, in the n 4tiAM 0.AA 1itlA ... ... V. made up by magnitude of hatred for his diminutive stature, and was the leading spirit and, though suitor ing from chronic inflammation of the eyes, from thos? oyes flashed mora indigna tion against Christ's followers than any one of the horsed procession. This lit tle man, before bis name was changed to Paul, was called tiaul. So many of the mightiest natures of all ages are condensed Into smallness of stature. The Frenchman who was sometimes called by his troops 01d One Hundred Thousand," was often because of bis abbreviated personal presence styled "Little Nap.' fjord Nelson, with in significant stature to start with, and one eye put out at Coivi, and bis right arm taken off at Tenerilfe, proves him self at Trafalgar the might est hero of the English navy. The greatest of American theologians, Archibald Alex ander, could stand undor the elbow of many of his contemporaries. Look out for little men when they start out for some especial mission of good or evil. The thunderbolt is only a condensation of electricity. Well, that galloping group of horsemen- on the road to Damascus were baited quicker than bombshell or cav alry charge ever halted a regiment The Syrian noonday, because of the clarity of the atmosphere, is the brlght- est of all noondays and the noonday sun in Syria Is posit. vol y terrific for bril liance. But suddenly that noon there flashed from the heavens a light which made the Syrian sun seem tame as a star in comparison. It was the face of the slain and ascended Christ, looking from-the heavens, and under the dash 01 uai overpowering ugnt an tue Dorses dropped with their riders. Human face and horses' mane together in the dust. And then two claps of thunder followed uttering two words, the second word like the first: "Saul! Saul!" For three days that fallen equestrian was totally blind, for excessive 1-ght will some times extinguish the eyesight. I bad read it a hundred times, but it never so impressed me before and probably will never so Impress me again, as I took my Bible from the saddle bags and read aloud to our comrades in travel: As be Journeyed, be came near Damascus and suddenly there sained round about htm a light from Heaven and be fell to the earth. and beard a voice aaying unto him. 'Saul I Saull Why persecutest thou me? and be said: 'YVhoartTbou, Lord? And the Lord said: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. N But we can not stop longer on this road for we shall aee this unhorsed equestrian later in Damascus, toward whieh his horse's bead is turned and at which we must ourselves arrive before night." The evening is near at hand, and as we leave snowy Hermon behind ns and approach the 200 minarets and domes, we cut through a circumference of many miles of garden which em bower tho city. So luxuriant are thasa gardens, so opulent in colors, so luscious of fruits, so glittering with fountains, so rich with bowers and kiosks that the Mohammedan's heaven was fashioned after what are to be seen here of bloom and fruitage. Here in Damascus at the right season are cherries, and mulber- - rles, and apricots, and almonds, and pistachios, and pomegranates, and P", d apples, and plums, and nitrons, and all the richness of the round world's pomology. Under my window to-night in the hotel at Damascus I bear the perpetual ripple and rush of the river A ban a. Ah, the aeeret is outl Now I know why all this flora, and fruit, and why every thing is ao green, and the plain one great emerald. The river Abana! And not far off the river Pbarpar, which our horses waded through to-day! Thank the rivers, or rather the God who made the rivers! Deserts to the north, deserts to the south, deserts to the east, deserts to the west, but here a parad.ee. And, as tne yivers Uibon. and Pison, and H d dekel aa-i Euphrates, made the other paradise, Abana and Pnarnar made this . &mnftgwi pr44efifc ftat is wfct CvtilM-.TM MohMmadM Balif Bop for Uu 13 Had. made General Naaman of th's city of Damascus so mad when he was told for the cure of his leprosy to go and wash in the river Jordan. The river Jordan Is much of the year a muddy stream, and it is never so clear as this river Abana, that I hear rumbling under my window to-night, nor as the river Pbarpar that we crossed to-day. They are as clear as though they had been sieved through some special sieve of the mountains. General Namaan bad great and patriotio pride in these two rivers of his own country, sod when Eliaba, the prophet, told him that if he wanted to get rid of his leprosy he must go and wash in the river Jordan, he felt as we who live on the magnificent Hudson would feel if told that we must go and wash in the muddy Thames, or as if those who live on the transparent Ehine were told that they must go and wash in the muddy Tiber. So General Naa man cried out with a voice as loud as ever be had used in commanding his troops, uttering those memorable words which every minister of the Gospel sooner or Utter takes for bis text: "Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than the waters of Is rael? May I not wash in them and be clean?" Onlv those who have traveled in the deserts of Syria or Egypt, or have in the Oriental cities heard the tinkling of the bell of those who sell water can realise what it is to have this beverage in abundance. We were awakened In the morning in Damascus by the song of those who have different kinds of food to sell. It Is not a street cry, as in London or New York, but a weird and long drawn out solo, compared with which a buzz-saw is musical. It makes you inopportunely waken, and will not let you sleep a-aln. But to those who understand the exact meaning of the song it becomes quite tolerable, for they sing: "God is the nourish or, 'buy my bread;' 'God is the nourisber, buy my milk;" "God is the nourisher, buy my fruit," As you look out of tbe city you see the Mohamme dans, who are in large majority in the city, at prayer. And if it were put to vote who should bo king of all the earth 1 5.0OO in that city would say Christ, but 130,000 would say Mohammed. Looking from the window, you see the house tops, and on the streets Moham medans at worship. Tbe muezzin or tbe officers of religion, who an nounce tbe time of worship, appear high on tbe ainerent minarets or tall towers, and walked around the mineret. enclosed by a railing and cry in a sad and mumbling way: "God is great. I bear witness that there is no God but God. I bear witness that Mohammed is the apostle of God. Come to prayers! Come to salvation! God is great. There Is no other but God. Prayers are better tban sleep Five times a day must the Mohammedan engage in worship. As ho begins he turns his face toward the city of Mecca, and unrolls upon the ground a rug which he always carries. With his thumbs touching the lobes of bis ears, and holding his face between his hands he cries: "God is great. Then folding his bands across his girdle be looks down and says: "Holiness to Thee, O, God, and praise be to Thee, Great is thy name. Great is thy great ness. 'I here is no deity but Thee. ihen tbe worshiper sits upon his heels. then he touches his nose to the rug and then his forehead, these genuflections accompanied with tbe cry: ''Great is God." Then raising the forefinger of bis right hand toward heaven ho says: "I testify that there is no deity but God and I testify that Mohammed ia the servant of God and the messenger of God. " Thero are two or three commendable things about Mohammedanism. One is that its disciples wash before every act 01 prayer, ana that is five times a day. ana there is a gospel in cleanliness. Another commendable thing is, they don't care who is looking, and nothing can stop them in their prayer. Another thing is that by the order of Mohammed, and an order obeyed for 1.&00 years, no Mohammedan touches strong drink. Hut the polygamy, the many-wifehood of Mohammedanism has made that re ligion the unutterablo and everlasting curso of women, and whon woman sinks, tho race sinks. The sp rit of the horrible religion which pervades the city of Damascus, along whose streets we walk and out of whoso bazars we make purchases and in : whose mosques we study tbe wood carv ings and bedizen merits, was demon strated as late as 1800, when in this city it put to death 6,000 Christians in forty-eight hours and put to the torch 3.000 Christian homes, and those streets we walk to-day were red with the car nage, and the shriek and groans of the dying and dishonored men and worn on made this place a hell on earth. This went on until a Mohammedan, better than his religion, Abd-el-Kader by name, a great soldier who In one war had with 25,000 troops beat 00,000 of the enemy, now protested against this mas sacre and gathered the Christians of Damascus into castles and private houses and filled his own home with affrighted sufferers. After awhile tbe mob came to his door and de manded tbe ''Christian dogs" whom he was sheltering. And Abd-el-Kader mounted a horse and drew his sword and with a few of his old soldiers around him charged on the mob and cried: "Wretches! Is this tbe way you honor the prophet? May his curses be upon you! Shame on you! Shame I You will yet live to repent. You think you may do as you please with the Christ' ana, but the day of retr.butlon will come. The Franks will yet turn your mosques into churches. Not a Christian will I give up. They are my brothers. Stand back or I will give my men the order to fire." Then by tbe might of one great soul under God the wave of assassina tion rolled back. Although now we Americans and for eigners pass through the streets of Da mascus unhindered, there ia in many parts of tbe city the subdued hissing of hatred for Christianity that if it dared would put to death every man, woman and child in Damascus who does not declare allegiance to Mohammed. But I am glad to say that a wide, hard splendid turnp ke road has within a few years been constructed from Beyrout on the shore of the Mediterranean to this city of Damascus, and, if ever again that wholesale assassination is at tempted, French troops and - English troops would, with jingling bits and lightning hoofs, dash up the hills and down on this Damascus plain and leave the Mohammedan murderers dead on the floor of their mosques and seraglios. But I must say that this city of Da mascus, aa I aee it now, ia not as ab sorbing as the Damascus of olden times. 1 turn my back upon the baaars, with ruga fascinating the merchants from Bagdad, and tbe Indian textile fabrlo of incomparable make, and the manu factured saddles and bridles gay enough for Princes of the Orient to ride and pull, and baths where ablation becomes inspiration, and tbe homes of those bargain makers of to-day, marbled and dlvanedandfountained and upholstered and mosaiced and arabesqued and col onnaded until nothing can be added, and the splendid remains of the great mosque of John, originally built with gates so heavy that it required five men to turn them, and columns of porphyry and kneeling pi aces framed in diamond and seventy-four stained glass windows and 600 lamps of pore gold, a sin gle prayer offered in this mosque aald. to be worth 80,000 prayers oor4i ay ctiiftp p!c. $ turn t bask on all these and a Dameacn as It was when this narrow street, which the Bible calls Straight, was a great w da street, a great thoroughfare cross ing tbe eity from gate to gate, along which tramped and. rolled toe pomp 01 all nations. There goes Abraham, the father of all the fa tbfuL He has ta this eity been purchasing a celebrated slave. There goes Ben Hadad of Bible time leading thirty-two conquered m on arc ha. There goes David, King, warrior and aaered poet; There goes Tamerlane, the conqueror. There goes Horoun al Kaschid, once tbe commander of an army of ninety-five thousand Persians and Arabs. There comes a warrior on bis way to the barracks, carrying that kind of sword which the world has forgotten how to make, a Damascus blade with tbe Interlacing of color changing at every new turn of the light, many colors coming and going and lnterjoining, the blade so keen it could cut in twain an object without making tbe lower partof the object tremble, with an elasticity that could not be broken though you brought tbe point -of tbe blade clear back to tbe hilt, and having a watered appearance which made the blade seem though lust dipped in a clear fount ain, a triumph of cutlery which a tbon aand modern foundrymen and chemists have attempted in vain to imitate. On the side of this street damasks, named after this city, figures of animals, and fruits, and landscapes here being first wrought into silk damasks. And specimens of damaskeeming by which in tots city steel and iron were first graved, and then the grooves filled with wire of gold damaskeem ing. But stand back or be run over, for here are at the gates of the eity laden caravans from Aleppo in one direction and from Jerusalem In another direc tion, and caravans of all nations paying toll to this supremacy. Great is Dam ascus! But what most stirs my soul is ablind man passing along the street, small of stature and insignificant in personal appearance. He was one of that caval cade coming from Jerusalem to Damas cus to kill Christians; and we saw him and his horse tumble up there on tbe road some distance out of the olty, and he got up blind. Yes, it ia Saul of Tarsus now going along this street called Straight. He la led by hia friends, for he can not see his hand be fore bis face, unto the house of Judas, not Judas the bad, but Judas the good. In another part of this city one Ananias, not Ananias tbe liar, but Ananias tbe Christian, is told by the Lord to go to this bouse of Judas In Straight street and put bis hands on the blind eyes of Saul, that his sight might return. "Oh," said Ananias, "I dare not go. That Saul is a terrible fellow. He kills Christians, and be will kill me." "Go," said the Lord, and Ananias went. There sits in blindness that tremendous persecutor. He was a great nature crushed. He had started for the olty of Damascus for the one purpose of assassinating Christ's followers, but since that fall from his horse he had en tirely changed. Ananias steps up to the sightless man, puts his right thumb on one eye and the left thumb on the other eye, and in an outburst of sym pathy, and love, and faith says: ''Brother Saul! Brother Saull the Lord, even Jesus that appeared unto thee in tbe way as tbou earnest, has sent me that tbou mayst receive tby sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost." Instantly something like scales fell from the blind man's eyes, and be arose from that seat the mightiest evangel of all agea There are many people in this bouse to-day as blind as Paul was before Ananias touched his eyes. And there are many here from whose eyes the scales bavo already fallen. You see all subjects and all thingsdifferently God, and Christ, and eternity, and your own immortal spirit. Sometimes the scales do not all fall at once. When I waa a boy, at Mount Pleasant, one Sunday afternoon read ing Doddridge's Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul, that afternoon some of the scales fell from my eyes and I saw a litt e After I had been in tbe ministry about a year, one Sunday : afternoon in the village parsonage read- i Ing the Bible story of the Syro-Pheni- j clan's faith other scales fell from my eyes and I saw better. Two Sunday evenings ago. while preparing for the evening service in New York, I picked up a book that I did not remember to have seen before, and after I had read a page about recon sec ration to God I think tberemaining scales fell from my eyes. Shall not our visit to Damascus to-day result, like Paul's visit, In vision to the blind and increased vision for those who saw somewhat before. I was reading of a painter's child who became blind in infancy. But after the child was nearly grown a surgeon removed the blindness. When told that this could be done, the child's chief thought, her mother being dead, was she would be able to see ber father, who had watched over ber with great tenderness. When sight came she was in raptures, and ran her bands over her father's face, and shut her eyes as if to assure herself that this was really the father whom ahe had only known by touch, and now looking upon htm, no ble man as be was, in appearance as well aa in reality, she cried ouU ' Just to think that I had this father so many years and never knew him!" As great and greater is the soul's joyful surprise when the scales fall from the eyes and the long spiritual darkness is ended, and we look up into our Father's face, alwsys radiant and loving, bat now for the first revealed and our blindness for ever 3x3 ne, we cry, "Abba, Father. To each one of this vast multitude of auditors I aay, aa Ananias did to Saul of Tarsus when sympathio fingers touched the closed eyelids: "Brother Saul! Brother Saull the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto tbee in the way that thou earnest, hath sent me that thou mlghteat receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost" The Book Ho Savd While the great fire was raging In Seattle, says an exchange, a prominent lawyer of the olty hurried up to his office to save a few of bis most valuable docu ments and books. He bad long been ac cumulating material for a history of Washington. These, of course, were peculiarly precious to bim, and he had besides a valuable library. The fire was upon him; whatever he d d he must do at onoe. He laid hia hands upon one book and manuscript after another. Yes, this one he must save, and this one, and this, and this.

It not only indorses and adheres to McKinleyism, but it favors steamship subsidies, calls for tl passage of the bayonet election bill, amd even ventures to say of the present cor rupt and shameless Congress, already repudiated as no other Congress ever was, that "its work may be confidently submitted to tbe considerate judgment of the people. If progressive Repub licans can find in such a manifestation of Bourbon Ism a single ray of comfort the Herald wishes them mucb joy. The message is an intensely parti sat t production, bearing evidence of hast? preparation and of the use of such ej euses and subterfuges as came first 'to hand in a disorderly scramble after something to say. To all intents and purposes it is a confession that the J lo- Kinley bill is all that the opponents of that measure have represented it to be, for the people are now told that that infamous law waa not expected to pnove beneficial immediately. They m ust wait a year or two until the riotous rob bers of the trusts fall out over the spoil, or until the sagacity of men de vises new schemes of competition by which its outrages may be evaded. In thus committing his party to tbe con tinued defease of a law designed to op press the many and to enrich the few tbe President will strengthen himself with the mill-owning fraternity which contributes campaign fat and makes and unmakes Presidential candidates. To this extent he is at least honest in his dishonesty, and his occasional ref erence to tbe subject of wages as though a fallacy so thoroughly ex ploded as that could be made to do duty any further shows that he Is -as callous to the scorn of intelligent mien as he is unmindful of the hardships of the oppressed. In a word, then, the Republican poli cy, as outlined by the President who hopes to succeed himself, coin pro htends these tbree points: 1. Unlimited mon opoly tariff taxes. 8. Unlimited power by the Davenports, Quays and Dinlleys over tbe people's elections. S. Unlim ited subsidies for steamships. 'Hope lessly infatuated as such a course must appear to all who are not undor the spell of monopoly, it should be borne in mind that Mr. Harrison lives in an at mosphere of privilege, injustice, aant and selfishness. The great leaders of his party are monopolists or attorneys of monopolists. Not one among them stands for any thing else. They fasten on the people. . They have profited so long by unwise and unjust laws, and the successful oppression of others, has seemed so respectable to them a'ad to others, that they naturally exert a pow erful influence upon a weak and vain man, who owes to them all that aa is and all that be hopes to be. They have paid for the McKinley bill in cash, con tributions. They will never give it tip until a triumphant Democracy ruth lessly sweeps away from them thyj pow er to corner markets and to choose Presidents. Dubious as the last ditch attitsude of their leaders must appear to honorable Republicans, Democrats will acce pt the situation cheerfully and proceed to ar range their forces for tho final struggle in 1813. The McKinley bill will be robber bill in that year the same as it is to-day. lime may obIittrate some of its baldest oppressions, but it can not temper tbe wrath of the in ill ion 1 whom, it has plundered. A Collection of IMntltudea. LCbicago News. In tho collection of weak platitude which constitute President Harrison's annual message to Congress tho Chief , Executive has succeeded in disappoint- j ing that portion of tho He publican party which is not wedded to discredited : Idols. It was hoped by many moderate and progressive Republicans that Prjaid?nt Harrison would at loast tako some cognisance of tbe recent popular, rebel lion ajainst high taxation. It 'was even hoped by some that tbe Presid ent might rise to the occasion with a manifestation of 'real statesmanship by seyvering tbe relations of his party with Its discred ited Bourbon leaders. How has the President met these ex pectation a? By a sorry display of tenacity to the very principles which the American people, including hundreds of thousands of progressive Republicans, have pro nounced against in thunder tones. Tbe President's shufS,ing apology for tbe McKinley law is the weakest point in a remarkably weak public document. His adherence to Mr. fine's reciprocity policy, aa em bodied in tbe eleventh hour amendment to the McKinley law, settles onoe for all tbe rumors of a apltt between the President and Mr. Blaine. It is now more clear than ever that Secretary Blaine's policy of reciprocity, however reluctantly adopted. Is relied upon by the BourAxm Republicans to lessen the nauseouf mess of the McKin ley law in actual operation. The Presi dent writes of the reciprocity question with the unfamiliarity of a tyro, but he has at least made it clear that James O. Blaine will hereafter hold the Re publican policy on tariff matters in the hollow of his hand President Harrison reserves the dis credited and utterly obnoxious Federal elections bill for the climax of his mes sage. In his adherence to the policy whieh materially helped to create the recent political Waterloo for tbe Re publicans Mr. Harrison strain demon strates the quality which marks Bour bon ism the world over naraely: "never to leain and never to forgut' In this portion of bis message President Har rison has widened the gulf between moderate rational Republicanism and that portion of his party which still be lieves that the "bloody shirt" will never fail as a talisman, of power. Mr. Harrison's utterances on other Katlwnal topics are characterized by conservatism and trite moralising. He handles several minor topics with wis dom and moderation, but the effect of the entire document will be almost de stroyed by its tame subservience to nar row and discredited political motives. In short, it is a spiritless and perfunc tory statement of the opinions of Bour bon Republicans. It is a synopsis not of personal convictions but of partisan preoepta of principles formulated by others but accepted and probably now believed in by himself. Smell Effort or m aU Saaa. f Chicago Times. 1 But why do we characterize Benjamin Harrison as a Bourbon? Because of his declarations regarding tn election law, which the Senate did not pass, and because notwithstanding the verdict of his countrymen expressed with unmis takable emphasis, he stands by tbe discredited Me&inley bill, which ha in6c si bis message shows, without states that its terms eonUfcet wtth a ree ; Iprocity treaty existing between the United States and the petty kingdom of Hawaii, and be asks that it be cured in this particular, but in no other. He de fends tbe force bill and nrges its pass age. It is a bill which would revive in the South the bayonet rule and the scandalous carpet-bag days, and is therefore a generation behind the time. There ia no likelihood that, notwith standing the President's advocacy, Che Senate will pass a measure so abhorrent to the popular aense of liberty and jus tice. The McKinley tariff bill, which the President approved and which he con tinues to advocate, had a well-defined purpose regarding nine-tenths o( the schedules. It was drawn in the spirit of the tariff resolution passed by the convention which nominated Harrison. Its motive was to discourage i m porta -talon of such articles as are made at home, yet we find tbe President declar ing that "already we begin to bear from abroad and from our custom houses that the prohibitory effects upon our impor tations imputed to tbe act are not justi fied. Then it ia no efficient Wherefore the President rejoices and demands a fair trial for it. Tbe in creasing price of commodities, which tells the real story, the President attrib utes to silver legislation, which he ap proved. Altogether he ia in a melan choly muddle about the matter, and knows nothing more tban this, that ho stands for a high protective tariff, which tbe people have condemned, and hopes when bis own day of trial comes the people may judge it more leniently. The President is not willing to leave to bis Secretary of State any credit for ad vocacy of reciprocity, but be goes far ther than tbe Secretary in suggesting that reciprocity mean something. We are to ooufino free trade to people with whom we have precious little trading that is, we are to have a shadow, not a substance. Tore message is important only in ao far as it indicates that there will be no repeal, and no modification except for xata correction of errors, as in the Hawaii aa matter, of tbe McKinley law, and t hat on the great economic qnestlons of the tariff the Republican position, de clared at Chicago, will not be substan tially changed, notwithstanding popular disapproval. The Republican ia a high tariff party. The reciprocity suggestion is a mere anchor to windward thrown out for what it is worth that is, for next to nothing. The message has this further inter est. It is the last but two that Benja min Harrison, undoubtedly the smallest man who ever occupied the Presidency, will formulate. Benoy Ts Too Old to r-aara (Chicago Post There is nothing in President Harri son's message to indicate that its author has been impressed witb the lesson of last month's elections. Those phenom enal expressions of publio opinion con veyed to all the world tbe people's unequivocal disapproval of the work of the controlling party in the Fifty-first Congress. hoever in that party had taken conspicuous part in tbe business of the session was selected for special rebuke. The single exception was Mr. Reed, and he was re-elected before the tariff bill had gone into effect McKin ley was defeated, and Lodge, though be escaped that fate, was returned by majority so greatly decreased as to amount to a moral defeat A majority of the House that favored tbe theories of McKinley and L-odje received tbo special intimation of their constituents that these theories were hateful to the American senso of right Thus spoke the American people, almost without regard for party, on No vember 4. They spoke in vain to Pres ident Harrison. Within a month from that day he addresses Congress with what amounts to a special plea an defense of the very measures repudiated by tho people at tbe polls. Less than thirty days ago the voters uoelaroj, in thunderous tones their repudiation of the McKinley I tariff bill and of tho Lodge election bill; 1 Mr. Harrison's retort to this is a mes sage to Congress impugning the popular verdict and urging Congress to continue in tho lined of tboso very measures. Tbo American people havo doclared their will in unmistakable tones, and President Harrison has told the Amer ican people tbat they don't know what they want. f It ia difficult to conceir what mo tives could have prompted the ut terance of such a message at such a time. President Harrison has of fered to bis follow partisans in tbo Fifty-first Congress tho choice between bis own expressed will and the ex pressed will of the people. He can hardly expect tbat he will bo preferred in such an alternative, or if be should be, tbat the outcome would be profita ble to bis own or his colleagues' politic al hopes. Tbe message has the sole merit of consistency; but It is the con sistency of a defeated man who can not or will not acknowledge his defeat A Collection of Kroarr Common plaeo.

He insists on high taxation and excessive expenditures for subsidies and bonuses in his second message, as in his first He indorses tbo McKrnley bill and protests against making any change in it He indorses tbe Windom bullion purchase scheme of silver demonetization and arrays him self against the free coinage of silver.

The President stands by bis guns In respect to the tariff and force bills, snd is careful to put his advocacy of them in tue rear of nis message, ao aa to se cure reading for tbe remainder. Had he started off with these topics, the rest would, have received scant attention from the public The most noticeable thing about his treatment of tbe tariff matter is that he has evidently learned nothing by experience. His economic argument is tbe same dreary twaddle he used to indulge in when be was mak log his campaign and talking about tbe superiority of markets to maxims.

POCK fiE-ELECUO. The Hattoai Oca. la, Fla., Deo. 7. After a short time devoted to routine business ia We afternoon session of the National Alli ance. President McOratn. of the Kan sas Alliance, moved that the annual election of officers be proceeded with, and he p'-aoed the name of L. T. Polk in nomination for president Mr. Polk was unauitnous'y re-elected by acclama tion. B F. Clover, of Kansas, for vice president, was also unanimously chosen. J.

8TOBUT SE&SIOX. Ocala, Fla., Dec. & A storm broke out in tbe National AUlanoe Saturday. It was eaused by tbe report of the oom mlttee on investigation of Polk, Ma cune and Livingstone. President Hall of tbe Missouri Alli ance, got the floor and holding ia bis band a written protest against the re port of the committee on investigation submitted and adopted Friday, read from manuscript his reasons for not signing that . report He had hardly read the beginning sentence when Ma cune's friends through Delegate Wynn, of Kentucky, objected to Hall stating his reasons, on the grounds that his previously formulated objections were in tbe nature of a minority report which be had now forfeited his right to make, by reason of tbe convention's final action on the majority (or regular) report of the committee. A cross-fire of objections and demands followed, during wbloh there was a deal of sharp shooting, and tbe excitement arose to the highest pitch. Those of the antt-Macuneltes who managed to make themselves beard said tbat If there was a "cat in tho bag" they wanted to let it out They de manded again and again that Hall's re port be read. The reading of the report was de manded by a large majority. As Mr. Hall arose from his seat again tbe troubled waters subsided In a most dignified manner, and amid deep silence he said that be had refused to sign tbe report of tbe Investigating committee for tbe following reasons: First, be cause it censured President Polk for writing tbe Norwood letter a censure which was unjust to Polk for various reasons; second, because it exonerated Dr. Macune, although'Macune had actu ally and openly admitted before the committee that he bad gone to Georgia ana formed a combination among Alliance legislators and orders in tbe interest of Pat Calhoun for United States Senator, because Ma cune had also admitted tbat Calhoun bad loaned bim (Macune) S'4,000 and because Macune bad further admitted that he remained sixteen days in Georgia lobbying for Calhoun's elec t on; third, because Macune bad ad mitted before the oommitteo tbat he had for the past year traveled on trans portation furnished bim by the West Point Terminal Company. Mr. Uali said with reference to a "loan" of $2,000 from Calhoun tbat Macune admitted before the oommitteo that be gave as security therefor an order for 4,000 on tbe National Alliance treasury. Proof bad also been adduced as to the policy of 1 the National fconooiist and tbe Georgia Alliance farmers in tbe interests of cor- j porations and monopolies. This change ' from the former policy In favor of the farming interests had been gradual but ultimately so marked as to have prac tically confirmed tbe suspicions of out- j side financial influence at that time. Other proofs as to lobbying snd several minor charges bad also beon presented. The reading of thla document pro duced a profound sensation in tbe con vention hall and in a few seconds an other scene of wild exo-tement was be ing enacted. Finally, as a sort of compromise. Colonel Livingstone secured the adop tion of a motion making the continu ance of tbe investigation a special order. As soon as quiet was restored tho convention listemtd to tbe report of the committee to which had been referred tbe proposition in President Polk's an nual message, suggesting a legislative council to consist of tho pres donts of all the State Alliances with tbe Nation al president as chairman ex-ofiiolo. Tbe report was in favor of this and was adopted by the convention. Tbo committee on the president's message w.th reference to salaries re ported In favor of making tbe presi dent's salary $3 900, with his traveling expenses, out of which he must pay his private secretary, and in favor of fixing his official residence in Washington. This report waa also adopted.
