This la no more , necessarily Lrue of the action of gov . ernmsnts than of the action of Individu als. It Is a sure sign of a base nature always to ascribe base motives for the actions of others. Unquestionably no nation can afford to disregard proper considerations of self-interest, any more , than a private Individual can do so. Hut It is equally true that the average pri vate Individual In any really decent com munity clfics many actions with rofer , ence tu other nmn in which he is guided, not by self-interest, hut by public spirit, by regard for the rights of others, by . a disinterested purpose to do good to " others, and to raise the tone of the com munity a n whole. Similarly, a really great .nation must often act, and as a , ..matter of fact often does act, toward j otlier. nations in a spirit not in the least .. of , mere.4 self-interest, but paying heed chiefly to ethical reasons: and as the centuries go by this- disinterestedness ... In international action, this tendency of .the Individuals comprising a nation to j.'," require that nation to act with Justice .toward its neighbors, steadily grows and strensthena.

During that fifty year the progress of the country !n every walk in 11 to has been a marvel to mankind, and she now stands ss one of the greatest of civilised nations: great In the arts of war and In the arts of peace; great In military. In Industiial, in artistlo development and achievement. Japanese soldiers and sailors have shown themselves equal In combat to any of whom history makes note She has produced great generals and mighty admirals: her fighting men, afloat and ashore, show all the herola cournge, the unquestioning. unfaltering loyalty, the splendid indifference to hardship and death, which marked the liyal Ronlns: and they show also that they possess the highest discreditable to us as a people, ana it may ri.

To no other rountry has there been such an In- i creasing number of visitors from this land na to Japan. In return, Japanese have come h're In gseat numbers. They are welcome, socially and Intellectually, In all ! our colleges and Institutions of higher ! learning, in all our nrofesslonal and social! I bodies. The Japanese have won In n single j generation the right to s'rtna abreast or tn- j femoat and mo-t enlightened peoples of ine their own merits and by their own exer- j tlons the right to trentme nt on a pnss or i full and frank equality. The overwhelm Ing mass of our people cherish n lively reg egard and respect for the people of Japan, a nd in almost every quarter or tne union the strangrr from Japan Is treated as he deserves; tnat Is, he is treated as tne stranger from any part of civilized Hit rope Is and deserves to be treated. Hut here and there a most unworthy feeling has mani fested Itself toward the Japanese the feel ing that has been shown In shutting them out from the common schools In San Fran cisco, and In muttering against them In one or two other places, because of their efflclencj- as workers. To shut them out from the public schools Is a wicked ah surd'ty, when there are no first-class co. leges In the land. Including the universltleo and colleges of California, which do not glndly welcome Japanese students and on which Japanese students do not r.-flert credit. We have as rnurh to learn from Japan as Japan has to learn from us, and no nation Is fit to teach unless It Is nlso willing to learn. Throughout Japan Amer icans are well treated, and any failure on the part of Americans at home to treat thj Japanese with a like courtesy and consider ation Is by Just so much a confession of Inferiority In our civilization. Importance of Fairness. Our nation fronts on the Pacific, Just as It fronts on the Atlantic. We hope to play a constantly growing part In the great ocean of the orient. We wish, as we ought to wish, for a great commercial develop ment in our dealings with Asia, and It is out of the question that we should per manently have such development unless we freely and gladly extend to other na tions the same measure of Justice and good treatment which we expect to re ceive In return. It is only a very small body of our citisens that act badly. Where the federal government has power It will deal summarily with any such. Where tho several states have power I earnestly ask that they also deal wisely and promptly with such conduct, or else this small body of wrongdoers may bring shame upon the great mass of their innocent and right thinking fellows that Is, upon our .nation as a whole. Good manners should be an international no less than an Individual attribute. I ask fair treatment for the Japanese as I would ask fair treatment for Germans or Englishmen. Frenchmen, Ilus sians or Italians. I ask It as due to hu manity and civilization. I ask It as due to ourselves because we must act uprightly toward all men. Japs as Citisens. I recommend to the congress that an aot be passed specifically providing for the naturalisation of Japanese who come here intending to become American citizens. One of the great embarrassments attending the performance of our International alillga tlons Is the fact that the statutes of the I'nlted States are entirely inadequate. They fall to give to the national government suf- flelently ample power, through L'nlted States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens In the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I there fore earnestly recommend that the crim inal and civil statutes of the L'nlted States be so amended and added to as to enable the president, acting for the I'nlted States government, which Is responsible In our International relations, to enforce the rights ul aliens under treaties. Even as the law now Is something can be done by tho fed eral covernment toward this end, and In the matter now before mo affecting the Japanese, everything that It Is in my power to do will be done, and all of the forces, military and civil, of the United States which I may lawfully employ will be so employed. There should, however, be no particle of doubt as lo Jhe power of the national government completely to perform and enforce Its own obligations to other nations. The mob of a single city may at any time perform acts of lawless violence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us into war. That city by Itself would be powerless to make defense against the foreign power thus assaulted, and If independent of this government It would never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts complained of The entire power and the whole duty to protect the offending city or the offending community lies In the hands of the L'nlted States government. It Is unthinkable that we should continue a policy under which a given locality may be allowed to commit a crime against a friendly nation, and the united States government limited, not to preventing the commission of the crime but, in the last resort, to defending the people who have committed It against the consequei.ces of their own wrongdoing. War Is Honorable. It must ever be kept In mind that war is not merely Justifiable, but Imperative, upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where peace can only be obtained by the sacrifice of conscientious ccnvlctlon or oi umiunai won ore. ieace is normally a great an individual, and neither a nation nor an Individual can surrender conscience to an other's keeping.

In character Just war U in the long run far better for nation's soul than tho most nrcwm-nmi peace obtained by acquiescence In wront or Injustice. Moreover, though it Is cilm lnal for a nation not to prepare for war so that it may escape the dreadful conse quences of being defeated In war. yet it must always be remembered that even to be defeated In war may be fur bette- than not to have fought at all.

KAVY ARE FOR PEACE Strength the Snrest Guaranty of Tranquility. Tho L'nlted States navy is the surest guarantor of peace which this country possesses. It is earnestly to be wished that we would profit by the teachings of historv in this matter. A strong and wise people will tudv Its own failures no lesj than Its triumphs, for there is wisdom to be learned from the study of both, of the mistake as well as of the success. For this purpose nothing could be more instructive than a rational study of tho war of 1812, as It Is told, for Instance, by Captain Mahan. There was only one way In which that war could have been avoided. If during the preceding twelve years a navy relatively as strong as that which this country now has had been built up. and an army provided relatively as good as that which the country now has, there never would have been the slightest necessity of righting the war; and If the necessity hnd urison the war would, under such circumstances, have ended with our speedy and overwhelming triumph. But our people, during those twelve years, refused to make any preparations what ever, regarding either the army or the navy. They saved a million or two dol lars by so doing; and in mere money paid a hundredfold for each million they thus saved during the three years of war which followed a war which brought untold suffering upon our peo ple, which at one time threatened the gravest national disaster, and which, in spite of the necessity of waging it. re sulted merely In what was In effect a drawn battle, while the balance of de feat and triumph was almost even. Maintain the .Navy. I do not ask that we continue to In crease our navy. I auk merely that tt be maintained at Its present strength; and this can be done only ir we replace tho obsolete and outworn ships by new and good ones, the equuls ol any am. at In any navy. To stop bufiding ships for one year means that for that year the navy goes back instead of forward. Tho old battleship Texas, for Instance, would now be of little Bervlce In a stand-up tight with a powerful adversary. The old double-turret monitors have outworn their usefulness, while it was a waste of money to build the modern single-turret monitors. All these ships should be re placed by others; and this can be done by a well-settled program of providing for the building each year of at least one first-class battleship, equal in size and speed to that any nation is at tho same time building; the armament pre sumably to consist of as large a num ber as possible of very heavy guns of one caliber, together with smaller guns to repel torpedo attack; while mere should be heavy armor, turbine engines, and in short, every modern device. Of course, from time to time, cruisers, col liers, torpedo-boat destroyers or torpedo boats, will have to be built also. Ail this, be it remembered, would not increase our navy, but would merely keep it a Its present strength. Equally, of course, the ships will be absolutely useless if the men aboard them are not so trained that they can get the best possible serv ice out of the formidable but delicate and complicated mechanisms intrusted to their, care. The marksmanship of our men has so Improved during the last five years that 1 deem It within bounds to say that the navy la more than twice as efficient, ship for ship, as half a de cade ago. The navy can only attain proper efficiency if enough officers and men are provided, and ii these officers and men are given the chance (and re quired to take advantage of It) to stay continually at sea and to exercise the fleets singly and above all In squadron, the exercise to be of every kind and to Include unceasing practise at the guns, conducted under conditions that will test marksmanship In time of war. Needs of the Schools. In both the army and the navy there Is urgent need that everything possible should be done to maintain the highest standard for the personnel, alike as regards otllceis and the enlisted men I do not be lieve that In any service there is a finer body of enlisted men and of Junior officers than we have In both the army and the navy, including the Marine corps. All possi ble encouragement to the enlisted men should be given. In pay and otherwise, and everything practicable done to render the service attractive to men of the right type. They should be held to the strictest discharge of their duty, and In them u spirit should be encouraged which demands not the mere performance of duty, but tho performance of far more than duty. If it conduces to the honor and tho Interest of the American nation; and In return the amplest consideration should be theirs. West Point and Annapolis already turn out excellent officers. We do not need to have these schools made more scholastic. 0,1 the contrary, we should never i sight of the fact that the aim of lose each ! school Is to turn out a man who shall be : uovo -riniin nrr n. hkhuiih man. in I the army in particular It is not necessarv i tnat either the cavalry or infantry omcer I should have special mathematical ability. Probably In both schools the best part of the education is the high standard of chat acter and of professional morale which It conrers. Hut In both services there Is urgent need for the establishment of a, principle of -lection which will eliminate men after a certain age If they cannot be promoted ' lr"m ,he subordinate ranks, and which will b;lng Into the hlirhei- ranke fewer men und I !hi",.i r.'rl'"r ' This principle of mil .r,,j.-nu iu uj euim mvil i of mediocre rapacity who are fitted to uo Wt,u whlu. younK (n ,ne lowt.r ,,s;ti,.s.

At present our men. especially in the navy, are kept far too long in the Junior grades, and then, at much t x advanced an age, are put quickly through the senior grades, often not attaining to these senior grades until they are too old to lie of real ii-e In them; and, If they are of real use, being put through them so quickly that little benefit to the navy cooks from their hav ing been In thtm ut a!!. Advantage of the Navr. The navy has one great advantage over the army in t lie fact that the othcn oi' high rank ate ui-.u.illy trained in the con tinual performance if their dutU-si that in, ill the managrmer.t of the battleship mij uriiiored ciui.-eib gathered into heels. Tins is not true of the army officers, who raicly have corret iHindin chances to tii-inn-command ove,- troop under service ciuii tions.

For years prior to tile Spanish war the secretaries of war Were pruised chiefly if they practiced economy, which. c norny, especially in con nection with the quartermaster, commissary and medical departments, was directly it siHinsible for most of the mismanagement that occurred In the war Itself and paren thetically be it observed that the very peo ple wno clamored for the misdirected econ omy In the first place were foremos; to d4M unre the mlFmanugement, loss and suf fering which were primarily due to mis same misdirected economy ami to thi :aik of preparation It involved.

Neglect to provide for nil of this means to Incur the risk of future disaster and disgrace. Example of Readiness. The readiness nnd efficiency of both the army nnd navy in dealing with the recent sudden crisis In Cului illustrate afresn their value to the nation. This readlmss and efficiency would have been very much less had It not been for the existence of the general staff In the army and the gen eral board In the navy; both are essential to the proper development and use of our military forces afloat nnd ashore. The troops that were sent to Culm were handled flawlessly. It was the swiftest mobiiUa- ; tlon and dispatch of troops over sea ever ! accomplished by our government. Tlc ex pedition landed completely equipped and ready for Immediate service, several of its organizations hardly remaining In Havana over night before splitting up Into detich ments and going to their several posts. It was a fine demonstration of the value and efficiency of the general staff. Similarly, ! It was owing In large part to the general board that the navy was able at the outset to meet the Cuban crisis with such instant efficiency; ship alter ship appearing on the shortest notice at any threatened point, I while the marine corps In particular per- ; formed Indispensable service. The army and navy war colleges are of incalculable value to the two services, and they ro-oper- , ate with constantly increasing emciency and importance. The congress haa most wisely provided for a national board for tho promotion of rifle practice. F.xcellent results have al ready come from this law, but It does not I go tar enougn. uur regular army is s small that in any great war we should have to trust mainly to volunteers, and In such event these volunteers should already know how to shoot, for If a soldier has the fighting edge and ability to take care of himself In the open his efficiency on tho line, of battle Is almost directly propor tionate to excellence in marksmanship. We should establish shooting galleries in all the large public and military schools; should maintain national target ranges in different parts of the country and should In every wny encourage the formation of rifle clubs throughout nil parts of the land. The little republic of Switzerland offers us an excellent example In all matters con nected with building up an efficient citizen soldiery.

The concluding sections of the president's message are devoted principally to a re view of Secretary Root's trip to the south and Central American countries, with a dis cussion of the congress that met at Rio de Janeiro. Mr. Roosevelt finds much en couragement In the reception accorded to Secretary Root and" the general Indications of a friendly regard for the L'nlted States of American among other American gov ernments. A discussion of the Drago doc trine, as considered at the Rio conference Is Included In this. The necessity of culti vating a closer commercial relationship with these countries Is pointed out. The Cuban revolution and the Interven tion of the L'nlted States Is reviewed, the j information being such as the public haa l already naa. Relations with the European powers are all friendly and get but brief reference. The question of pelagic sealing is brought up by reason of the disinclination of the Canadians to be bound by the treaty of Paris and the absolute disregard of the Japanese for Its provisions. The treatment of some Japanese seal pirates, captured In the act of slaughtering seals. Is recounted, and the intention of tha government to deal strictly with them Is set forth. A copy of Secretary Root's address at Rio de Janeiro Is made an appendix to the message. '

Fines of $50 and costs were assessed against two saloon men, Joe Calabria, 20tj6 Poppleton avenue, and B. A. Dl'.ts, of the Thurston hotel bar, In police court Tues day morning for selling liquor Sunday. This Is Just double the line Imposed on the other saloon men who were convicted of selling liquor one recent Sunday during the crusade against open saloons. The extra penalty was Imposed by Judge Craw ford for the reason that the saloon men had been amply notified, through the press and otherwise, that the law was to be en forced to the letter. Calabria and Dlltz pleaded guilty in the belief that the usual fine of $2i and costs would be the penalty, and when the fine was doubled they sent up a protest. Tho men said It was not a square deal to fine them Just double that which their fellow saloon men had been fined last week. Judge Crawford turned a deaf ear to their entreaties to reduce the fine find In timated that In future cases even heavier fines would be assessed.
