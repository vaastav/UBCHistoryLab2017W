It is barely possible that our great coast upholders have ascer tained that Mr. Cleveland does not take quite so much interest in their schemes as they would like to have him, and for this reason they have invoked the voice of Mr. l'ildeu two days before the meeting of con gress an I publication of the president's mes sage.
