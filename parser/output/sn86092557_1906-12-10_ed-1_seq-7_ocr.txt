It is not merely official, but distinctly personal It expresses Mr. Roosevelt's views on every large topic of public debate. His interests are as broad as the country, t and everything -which interests him j interests him Intensely. The mes- , save is more than a report; II bristles , with recommendations to Congress for . legislation. It Is more than a mass of , legislative recommendations; It Js full | of the discussion of subjects regard- | ing which no legislative suggestions | are formulated, it is a mesaege to , Congress, but It is still moco a mes- i sage to the people, for the President's i slate papers to-day' are addressed | chiefly through the newspapers to the ] public.

He renews his suggestions for legislation giving the United Slates the right of appeal in criminal cases, which would specifically help the government in its antit-rust prosecutions. He favors an eight hour day for labor, so far as that is practicable; a federal commission of inquiry and publicity looking to arbitration in strikes, an amendment to the Employers* Liability law placing the entire 'risk' of the trade" upon the employer, and some restriction of injunctions in labor disputes. He advises legislation for currency reform and the passage of a shipping hill, though in neither case does he explicitly adv-cate any specific measure. Roosevelt and Bryan Merger. New York World.

Mr. Koosevelt renews his formei recommendation that Congress enact such a law. Mr. Bryan urged tbe enforcement ol tlie criminal clause of the Sherman law against trusts. Mr. Roosevelt itshs for ihe right of appeal In such criminal cases on questions of law, holding that it is absurd to permit a singio district judge to declare a law of Congress unconstitutional against What might be the Judgment of an lm mouse majority of his colleagues on I he bench, and then deny to the government the right to have the Supreme court definitely decide the question. Takes Advance Ground. Washington Post. With his customary vigor and frankuess, the President discusses at great length la his annual message the queslions which, in his Judgment, are paramount in this country. He takes advanced ground, as was expected, on several propositions. He advocates :lic imposition of a graduated income lax 'when next our system of taxation is revised." He believes that If a :< nstltutlomi! Income tax law cannot ie devised, there will he no alternaivo to an amendment of the Consittitlon.

The shorter the session of Congress he longer the message to It, appears o lie President Roosevelt's rule. To ilm the lessened chances of enacting my laws at all except tlie necessary ipproprlatlon bills seem only to be an iterative to recommend nil sorts of cgislalJon. But It Is alawys a lecture is well as a message which Mr. Roosefelt writes when he "thinks aloud" on iuch occasions. It Is not a legislative irogninime that lie has In mind so mich as a statement of iievsonal views. Plils accounts for his hortatory tone, lis longueurs, his reiteration of Ideas vith which he has made us tolerably amillnr. Indeed, there Is hardly a :oliitnn of his message before which lit- ruuuvr uvea uui icci wive uvuius lis lial lii the manner of the satirist 5iron at passage after passage of a ragedy which a young poet was raedug (o Win. He explained It as "a habl I have got of saluting my old acliinlnluiiccs." Control of Railroads. 'bilatlelphia Press. While holding out for a firm govrnment control of railroads, the 'resident claims that the prohibition gainst railroad combination Is futile nd is wrong, because a railroad may nnt to combine for a good purpose, nd this freedom of action should not e denied it. He developes his scheme f a graduated inheritance tax and ouches ou the possibility of an innme las which the Supreme court my approve. He reiterates his rocmmcndutlon that Congress pass the hip subsidy bill, and lends the weight f Ills approval to the proposed authoration of taxed emergency bank curcney. He is as ever a believer in n trong navy. He does not urge an in ease In I lie strength of our present nvy beyond thai already authorized, le Insisls that II should he maintain i in strength by promptly replacing I worout ami obsolete vessels with odern new ones. Most Ambitious State Paper. York American. j Ill |H?)1[ OI U1U IllllIli'lT iillM nuiinr r of Its recommendations, President ooseveil's message to the second soson of the Fifty-ninth Congress is the ost ambitious state paper of his onfor. lie has not hesitated, wherever deemed it expedient, boldly to bornv Democratic doctrine, and the kind ' Democratic doctrine to which his irty has been and is still opposed, is views on limiting 'the hours ot her. more stringent enforcement of e employers' liability net, federal mtrol of corporations, a graduated heritAlice tax and a graduated inane tax. are merely reappearance, in I modified form of view's held and ad cated |?y his political opponents ng before bis own opinions were )n I I stock before you p Marriage and Divorce Question. New York Sun. Notwithstanding the difficulty In volved in any attempt to amend the : federal Constitution, the President declares that in his judgment the whole ' question of marriage and divorce i should be relegated to the authority oi the national Congress. We cannot agree with him in bis assertion that "the change would be good from every i standpoint." As was well pointed out by Chief Judge Cullen in an address lust year before the students of the Brooklyn Law School, a uniform divorce law would be a uniformly bnd law, from the standpoint of New York; for whereas in this State absolute dl vorce Is now permitted only on the ground of infidelity, under a uniform law such as would be enacted by Congress at least half a dozen other causes would be added. What Is really needed Is not a general law providing what shall be the causes for an absolute divorce in all parts of the country, but the adoption by the several States of a general role which shall prohibit the courts of the State where the defendant is an actual resident of the State or has been served with process within the territorial limits of that State. More Radical Than Bryan. New York Press. The President Is far more radical, as he addressed Congress now, than William J. Bryan ever dared to be tea years ago. Very properly so. The anuses wmcn were moor in louu nave become more odious. The practices which threaten the welfare anil happiness of the American people are grown more widespread, more rjlln less. The people themselves are Intensely aroused. It Is fitting that their chief magistrate should nerve his radicalism to greater extremes as the necessities of conditions and the spirit of the nation demand.
