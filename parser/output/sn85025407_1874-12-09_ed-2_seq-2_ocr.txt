Edmunds and Eaton were presented.— Mr. Morrill reported from the special Committee an entirely new scheme of government for the District of Columbia, embracing a system of Municipal Boards the chief of whom shall be three Regents, to be appointed by the President and eon firmed by the Senate. Mr. Sherman sub mitted a bill for the revision of the Cus toms laws. Among other bills introduc-; od was one for the relief of the Western sufferers by the ravages of the grasshop pers. and another to break up the impor tation of Chinese into California under a system of slavery. In the House a number of the new members who had been elected to fill va cancies were sworn in. The forwardness rff business was remarkable for the open ing of the session, six of the Appropria tion bills being reported and days fixed for their consideration. These, and the amounts named in them, were as follows: Legislative. Executive and Judicial. $19,053,434; Army. $27,701,500; In dian, $4,805,807; Fortifications. $850,- 000; Naval. slo,97o,7o6;Consular and Diplomatic. $1,338,935. Mr. Phelps endeavored to introduce a bill for the repeal of the Poland (Jag law of the lasi session, but he was shutoff by Mr. But ler. The irrepressible Mr. Cox could not refrain from letting Mr. Butler know how good ho felt over the elections by reminding the latter that his (Cox’s) side of the House would soon be iu the majority. After this remark the House adjourned, Mr. Phelps giving notice that he will press his bill for the repeal of the Poland law. Secretary Bristow's Report The inflationists will derive no more comfort from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury than from the Presi dent's message, as it is fully as emphatic iu its advocacy of a speedy return to specie payments. He recommends that the date at which resumption shall begin be fixed at not more than throe years from the present, and then in order to raise gold for the purpose of redeeming so much of the paper issue as may be presented authority should be conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury to 1 sell bonds. The legal-tender act should be repealed, the repeal to take effect from a fixed date, and to apply to all contracts made after that date, except the expen ditures of the Government under exist ing appropriations. He does not favor the restoration of the moiety system, but thinks that the penalties for the vio lation of the customs laws have been in juriously modified in several particulars. In regard to the tariff, he recommends that if Congress should determine to: take any action upon it. it should be! done deliberately; to which end he sug gests that a commission be appointed to revise the tariff and report to the next: Congress. He urges rigid economy ami a careful revision of the estimates of ex penditures. Secretary Robeson’s Report. Sseretary Robeson's report, shows our little navy to be in good condition, con- i sidering the small amount of money that is spent upon it and the age of many of its ships. It now consists of 163 vessels of all classes, but probably one-third of these are practically worthless. We have seventy-three steam vessels nomi nally fit for cruising, but there are but fifty- eight of them that are of service.! and of these forty-one are now in com mission. Twenty-one of our iron-clads can do duty, and the rest are ready for the junk shop. Mr. Robeson devotes a considerable portion of hie report to a commendation of the great naval drill off the Florida const last winter as a specimen exhibition of the discipline and efficiency of the navy. The Secretary WMrhere favors extravagant expenditures but he argues that there should be a re gular addition to the navy each year to replace worn-out and retired ships. An interesting portion of the report is that treating of the movement amongst the people of Iceland to abandon their an cient home ami settle upon the North Pacific coast of the l United States. ——— u— ■HI 111 jwnmg".l—Hß.miw n a———q—nil mil a——un —I .rm, —lW—WW—l—wn-frr iwa——i . . 

MAIIYLAXI) I]SrDEPE]Srr>E]SrT—December i>, 1874. The President’s Message. The Message of President Grant, as ‘ transmitted to Congress, is iu many re- , gpccts a more forcible one than could have boon anticipated from those which have hitherto emanated from our self-in dulgent President. In the very begin ning he touches sharply upon the exist i ing financial distress of the country. — i Business and industries are. ns he truly Fj says, prostrated, while lalsir and capital are plenty, -’ He therefore thinks that “wise statoßttwuiship at this session of Congress would dictate legislation ignor ing the past, directing in proper chan nels these great elements of prosperity." I Most excellent advice, if only carried f out. The large public debt he considers , an element of depression, and the “sys ■ tem of currency'’—paper—wlticli it is . impossible to keep at par, has. fie thinks, • induced a most pernicious spirit of spee ■ ulation and extravagance among the pe<>- • pic. Rather coolly, if not sarcastically, • j he remarks that he docs not question toe , wisdom of the introduction of this cur rency at the time of its adoption. He urges, as a matter of justice and good ‘ faith, that the bonds held abroad should i be paid in coin or its equivalent, or else ! National disgrace is inevitable. To oh-! tain means for this, commerce, tnnnufnc ’ I tures and agriculture should bo encour •! aged. The first step to bo taken is, he , says, “to secure a currency, good wher ever civilization reigns," and this, lit thinks, consists only of gold and silver.! to which we most return at the earliest j I possible moment, and until that Is don. . In- ilet-biros that no permanent prosperity can be expected. The delay in resump tion of specie payment partakes of dis -1 honesty, and the only way to resumption • is through the positive action of Congress. . He says: “I believe it is in the powei I of Congress at this session to devise such legislation as will renew confidence, re vive all industries, start us on a eared ■ of prosperity to last for many years, and ; to save the credit of the nation and tin . I 1 ™!’! 1 '” I!*• depicts too evils arising from tin fluctuations of the present medium of ex change, and repeats: “It is the duty of (’ongress to devise the method of correct ! ing the evils which are acknowledged t. exist, and not muu-; but I will venturi to suggest two or three things which seem to me as absolutely necessary to return to specie payments, the first great requi site in a return to prosperity. The legal tender edanse to the law authorizing the issue of currency by the National Gov- . eminent should be repealed, to take ef fect as to a!) contracts.entered into after the day fixed iu the repealing act, not t apply, however, to the payment of sala- : ries by the Government or for other ex penditures now provided by law to be paid in currency in the interval ponding between repeal and final resumption.— Provision should be made by which the Secretary of the Treasury can obtain gold as it may become necessary, from time to time, from the date when specie re i d‘inption commences. To this might . and should be added a revenue sufficient ly in excess of expenses to insure an ac cumulation of gold in the Treasury to I sustain redemption.” t The President favors free banking at I I the same time as resumption, and even declares that they are essential to each 1 other. The President, as will be seen. ' insists upon action in relation totbecur . rency in a rather pertinacious, if not ag gressive manner, when wc know that the general opinion of those “who speak by r the card” is, that no financial legislation . can be effected during this session. He speaks favorably of our foreign relations, which have been friendly dur ing the past year with all other Powers, j He hopes for a successful result of the 1 i pending negotiations for further opening i j to onr commerce of the Empires of China land Japan. He renews his recommen dation that a special Court be authorized | to hear all claims of aliens against the I United States for damages to person or : j property “during the insurrection.” He I alludes to the progress of the survey to • determine the boundary between the j United States and British Possessions in America, and states that the field work hay been completed. He states that the “Court of Com , missioners of Claims” cannot possibly complete the work before it prior to Feb ; runry, 1875, when it expires by law. and asks an extension of the time of its ' jurisdiction. In relation to the Cuban struggle, he . says that “six years of strife gives the j insurrection a significance which cannot l>c denied," and thinks that some positive steps should be taken in the matter.— The questions between this Govornment and Spain are still unsettled, but a speedy adjustment is hoped for. The President calls attention to the frauds perpetrated upon the diplomatic and consular officers of the United States by means of false naturalization certifi cates, and ask that legislation be shaped to punish offenders in such eases. The President refers to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, ami con curs in its recommendations. 110 ad vises that the tariff be readjusted, so as to increase the revenue, while decreas ing the number of articles upon which duties are levied, and again pointedly calls attention to the unwisdom of recent legislation. In commenting upon the Array and Navy reports, the President suggests various improvements in those branches of public service. 110 also re views the report of the Postmaster Gen eral and notes the suggestions for an equitable adjustment of compensation t" | railroads for carrying the mails. Tn reference to the difficulties in tin State of Louisiana the President explains an J endeavors to justify his sets in re cognising and supporting the Kellogg Government, urnl states that unless Con gress shall take action in the matter ho will continue to do so. Hcalsodoelur. s that the presence of Cnited States troops was necessary in many portions of the Southern States to prevent and punish the intimidation of voters at the polls, and denounces the White Leagues anil other societies of that class. He says, in reference to the Arkansas troubles, i that he declined to interfere pending the Congressional investigation of the mat ter, and calmly expresses a general re pugnance to Executive interference in the affairs of the States. Of tie ques tion of the difficulties between the races he says: ‘■JjCt there he fairness in the discussion of Southern questions, the advocates of 1> >lh nr all jioliticul parties giving honest, truthful re |ior;s of Oeciirrouees. condemning the wrong end upholding tfle rijrlit. and soon all will be well, t'nder existing conditions the negro votes the Republican ticket because he knows hi* f,tends are of that party. Many n good citizen votes the opposite, not because he n grees with the great principles of State which separate the parties, but because generally he is opposed to negro rule. This is a most de lusive cry. Treat the uegro use citizen and a voter as he is. and must remain, nnd soon par ties will be divided, not over the color line but upon principle. Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference." He refers briefly to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and Commis sioner of Agriculture, and praises the reforms in the Civil Service, lie great ly favors the revival vf shipbuilding, particular) of iron steamships, and pro poses that ample compensation for carry ing the ocean mails he offered as tin in j eentive thereto. The concluding por- I tion of t’tvt Message discusses affairs in the District, and the survey of the Mis sissippi river. Before a large audience of repre sentative business men and distinguished members of the leading professions in Baltimore, Prof. Bonamy Price, of Oxford T’ diversity, lectured on Saturday evening last, in Lehman's Hall. The learned lecturer, distinguished as one o! the leading p ditieil economists of Kng •and, deliverol a moat exhaustive ad dress on the subject of Currency, and its relation to capital. Briefly it may be said that after explaining the origin of currency —metal and paper —ho im pressed his hearers with the importance of recollecting that currency was merely a too! of exchange. He next considered the depreciation in value of American currency, and strongly deprecated any further inflation as only tending to nwj in enabling money to be secured for speculative purposes, and thus diverting it from regular channels of trade. He advocated earnestly a resumption of specie payment at some time to he abso lutely established by Congress. He spoke of the presqp*. tUandul condition of America as being such as to place her far below the position she ought to oc cupy in the estimation of the world. JfcP’lt is now proposed to colonize oui very unattractive possessions in Alaska As they are too damp and cold for tie ardent American temperament, they are kindly recommended to the hardy and phlegmatic natives of Iceland. An Ie •- landic commission has recently prospect ed over portious of the territory, and is reported to declare that, though the country may he death to the ordinary races of people, it is a nice land for an Icelander. Very well; we are not only satisfied, but happy. Let them come over, one and all. We decidedly prefer the Norse to the Chinese immigrants as compatriots; and there would, besides, lie a charming romance in seeing the same healthy hut not overwise race, wlm were cheerful aud happy on the bleakest j tracts of the eastern shore of the Con tinent five hundred years befor the voy age of Columbus, just as content in this day to Ik* settled upon equally undcsirat ble lands three thousand miles to the west. jt-t?’ It is understood that it is contem plated by Justice f'wayne to retire from the bench of the Supreme Court in a few months, under the law of Congress.— Justice Swnync, if he retires, will have his full salary during the remainder of his life. This will give another appoint ment on the Supreme Court Bench to President Grant, who has already had the appointment of four Supreme Court Judges, and another during his term of office would make a majority of the Court his appointees. Such a thing has never happened before during the in cumbency of any I’resident. sl? Some important questions con nected with the Granger movement in the west will soon coiuc before the Supreme Court of the C.S. for decision. There are three cases pending, which in volve the constitutionality of the law.-, which are hostile to the interests of western railroad corporations. One of! these cases will probably be argued early j in February. OUR
