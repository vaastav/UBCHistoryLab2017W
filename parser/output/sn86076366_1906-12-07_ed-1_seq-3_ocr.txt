Few men bare the annoy disposition that marked Mr. Cuney's life iu our mid?t and has made brighter and lighter many a day for others. Ever polite and considerate of the feelings of otborp, he disliked to cauue any delay or to have misunderstood your wi->he8. A moment's lateness in matters pertaining to thia obnrcb, the ringing of the beU for example, brought forth a profound and sincere apology. He did not foriret if you did him a kindness, but he forgot (at least so he would have you think) he had ever done anything for you. fbe nurse, who attended him during hia last illueas waa so touched by hia thoughtfulueao and it unto politeness, for till he Inosed into unconsciousness, every act of relief or kindneas had ita, Oh, thank, yon."
