By DATTD X>AWVJB!?CB (Co;>> r:sh: by The intelligencer) >. J Washington. Dec. 11\?The repara tions problem which for tour years has kept Europe tu a state ot appre hension has been deposited ior set tlement on the doorstep ot the White House. The deadlock in the conference ot premiers at London with the decision to have another conference In Janu ary means that Europe still hopes the I'nited States wUl lend a helping voice If not a hand in bringing the na toins together on a workable pro gram. Try as the American government may under this administration as separate and distinct trorn the matter of allied war debts to the I'nited States the political side of the matter reveals how inseparable the two real ly are. Great Britain is trying to ap pease French sentiment by proposing a cancellation or British debt in ex change for an agreement on France's part to accept a lower reparation from Germany. And when that cycle ot negotiation begins, it usually endc with the barrier of America's debt on the adjustment ol which no authorita tive word has beeu spoken by anyon-"1 even the Funding commission ap pointed by act of congress. , U. S. Influence. I? the I'nited States would only discuss the question of reparation am. war debt and express an opinion, her moral influence would go far toward compelling a settlement. The scale:, are evenly balanced. America can throw her weight in any direction and lorcfc her own viewpoint. Europe is ready to listen to American proposal not alone because they come iron) a nation detached troni Europe <ootro versles of a political aud economical nature but because America is a cred itor nation with tinancial power. In the background is the land arma mont situation which is keeping Ku rope mi edge and draiu'ng the budgets of all 'lie powers on toe continent. The I'nited States i> st'M waiting tor France (o ratify the naval disarmament treaty. Although tf is denied here that the development ot American policy toward Europe has any relation to the delay in the French parliament in ratifying too treaties negotiated at the arms con ference here a year ago. the parcttcai effect of the delay is about the same thing. Ameyira will not consider talc mg a mo're active part in Europe while France blocks the way >>n som" thing whteh and is vital to the Harding administration ratification of its first big international action. C'emenceau s visi:. Former fremler Clemenreaii s visit contributed a friendly touch to a cor troversial atmosphere but until the sovc-nraent of t'romter Foincar? <hows the same flexibility in policy as did M. t'lcmeacpau in personal con tact with America there will be little chance of convincing the Harding ad ministration that even a slight depar ture front its policy ot seclusion Would be of any avail at this time. Were France to manifest a ruor* tractable attitude there Is ^10 teiimg what progress nile'.'t be made toward winning the cooperation of fresident Harding and Secretary Hughes. Trie insertion by the President in his re cent message of a direct hint that America would like to see the princi ple of the four power pact applied to Europe was not au accident it had a purpose. No one will admit tnat it was an overture to France, the ex pression of a hope that France would ratify the naval arms treaty and open the way t.? further steps in interna toinal conference with America in eluded. But that is th? meaning at tached to it by most ol the diploma's who ha\e cabled their ioreign office-* about it. And they think it ?.-? otic or the most significant steps that has been taken by Mr. Harding since the arms conference jnet a year ago. ^ European Kacv. The ambition of ttie Harding ad ministration, of course. is to tulftll; the pledge made for somr kind ot a- ! xxiatiou or nations in place of the alleged super-government of the league of nations. The latest devel opment is the idea ol making a tive power or six power pact In Kurope tJ include the t'nlted States, tl-rmany. Great Britain. France, Italy and prob ably Belgium to bind themselves mu tually to respect each others right.-. Such a guarantee by France that 'I would respect the territorial integrity of Germany and such an assurance that the Germans would be commu ted against an invasion of France would not carry with it an obligation on six powers to take sides if the treaty weTe violated, hut would mean an Instant conterence wherein moral suasion would be applied and the principle of investigation Mr. Harding's c.hlrt id?u on inter national affairs fs the Bryan td>-a o: resting agreements 0:1 moral rather than physical force. Kurope s plan tor American aid in solving tlie reparation problem may hasten the day for the proposal o; such a treaty. France can help ma terially by ratifying the arms trea ties Between now and the propose.* conference of tic allied premiers in January something may be expected from the Washington government, 1 move toward participation based, oi course, on tiie thought that Kurop ' must boou make a beginning ot her
