In addressing my third annua! iue- , sage to the law making branch of the government, it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past year sue- , res has generally attended the ef-1 forts to execute all the laws found up on the statute book-. The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom; of the laws already enacted, but to learn their i-pint and intent, for" them accordingly. The past year has, under . 10 anu en- Wise;. - - Kroviuenw, been one 01 geiif-ra. pros-j iKfriiy w iiitruiiLiirii. hub-), iwwoiti, teen attended with more than usual chastisement in the loss of life and property by storm and fire.

THE 

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITIAN. The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been an event ful one in witnessing two great na tions, speakingone language and Iiav ing one lineage.settling by arbitration disputes of long standing and liable at any time to bring those nations in '.t bloody and hostile conllicls. An example has thus been set which, if xuccessful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized nations, and be the final means of returning to productive industry millions of men . .

I transmit, herewith, a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been con cluded since the adjournment of Con gres with her lirilannic Majesty, and a copy of the protocol and of the con ferences of the Commissioner by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the ! 1 i : questions pending between the two I nations. The various quest ions are to tie adjusted by arbitration. I recom-1 mend (ingress at on early day to ! make the necessary provision for the j at Gneva, and for the sever- al commissions on the part of the t I "nited States called for by the treaty, j His Majesty, the King of Italy, the of the Swiss Confederation, i ,i ii ; r:.. i. i.'n.rvo... ,.r u,. I a,.. a-i.n jioij, ,.,.. ...M. a- zil, have each consented, on the joint refiuest of the tw powers, to name an , arbitrator for the tribunal at Jeneva. I have caused my thanks to lie suita bly expressed for the readiness with which the Joint request has been com plied with by the appointment of gen tlemen of eminence and learning to these important positions. His Maj esty, the Kmperor of Ciermany, has been pleased to comply with the joint request of the two governments, and has consented 10 act as the arbitrator of the disputed wa'er b.uiidnry lie- tween the Tinted Slates and fireat I Uritain. : The contracting parties in the treaty ! Iiave undertaken to regard, as between themselves, certain law ror which the I nited States has contended from the commencement principles of public ; I'nited States has f their history. They have also j agreed to bring these principles to the ; knowledge of the othermariUmepow-, ers,andto invite them to accede to them. Negotiations are going on as i the form of the note by which the ; invitation is to lie extended to the i I lowers. I recommend t lie legislation i necessary on the part of the I'nited States to bring into operation the art- icles of the trpaty relating to the fish eries, and to the other matters touch ing the relations of the L'nited States toward the British Xorth American Possessions, to become operative as soon as the proper legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britain and its Possessions. It is much to be de- sired that this legislation may lieeome j operative before the fishermen of the United States liegin to make their ar- i ragemenU for the coming season. j have addressed a communication, , of which a copy is transmitted here- with, to the Unvernnrs of New 1 orfc. Pennsvlvania.Ohio. Indiana. Miehi- 'an.

It ' lv is hoped that the importance of the 1 and the benefiU to flow there- ; ed from will secure the speedy approval and legislative sanction of the States concerned. I renew the recommen dation for an appropriation for de termining the true position of the 4!th parallel of latitude, where it forms the boundary between the 1'nited States and the British North American Pos sessions, between the Bake of the Woods and the summit of the Rocky of Mountains. The e.-.rly action of Con- ... . gresjs in mis recommendation named i would put it in the power if the War ' Department to place a force in the ' field during the next summer. 1 FRANCE AND GERMANY. Ihe resumption of diplomatic rela-; Hons between trance and Germany ; is has enabled me to give directions for of ; of the withdrawal of the protection ex tended to the Germans in Prance by the diplomatic and Consular represen tatives of the I'nited States in that country. It is just to add that the delicate duty of this protection has lieen performed by the Minister and Consul-Genera! at Paris, and the va rious Consuls in Franco under the the supervision of tlie latter, with great 1 kindness, as well as with prudence and tact. Their course has received the commendation of the German government, and has wounded no susceptibility of jhe French. The government of the Kmperor of Ger many continues to manifest, a friend ly reeling toward the I'nited States, andaoesire to harmonize with the I moderate and just policv which this I maintains in its relations ! with the Asiatic powers, as well as i with theSouih American republics. I j an ! oi i ers. iavegiven assurance that lhe friemllv feelings of that government are fullv shared by the I'nited States. THE CONSULAR AND TREATY WITH AUSTRIA. i .

Tliave been officially informed ofj the annexation of the States of the Church to the kingdom of ltalv, and tlie removal of the capital of that kingdom to Borne. In eouformitvi with the established policy of tlie 1 ntl States, I have recognized liis this change. The ratifications of the. new treaty of commerce between tlia fmted States and Italy have been ex- changed. The two powers have a-ieeu in their treaty that propertv at sea' shall be exempt from capture in case .,i ui urt.ccu me two powers. The I nited States have snared no oppor tunity of incorporating this rule into the obligations of nations. OUR CLAIMS AGAINST SPAIN FOR DAMAGES IN CUBA.

THE MEXICAN FREE ZONE. The republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable law. establishing what in known as the free zone on the frontiers of thel'nited States. It is hoped that this may lie done, and also that more stringent measures may be taken by that re tribunal public for restraining lawless persons on its frontiers. I hope that Mexico, by its own aetion, will soon relieve this government rf the difficulties ex l'resident perienced from these causes. OUR

THE 

CUBAN QUESTION. It is a subject for regret that the re forms in this directum, which were voluntarily promised by the states men of Spain, have not lieen carried out in its West India colonies. The laws and regulations for the apiarent abolition or slavery in t una and iorto Bico leave most of the laliorers in bondage, with no hope of release nn I t'' tlleir livps heeome a burden to their employer. I desire to direct your at- leiiiiun m tin: liii i uiai tuc iTiiienn n the I'nited States are large holders, foreign lands, of this Rliecies of property, forbidden by the fundamen respectively tal law of their adopted country. I recommend to Congress to provide, by stringent legislation, a suitable remedy against the holding, owning dealing in shwes.or being interested slave property in foreign lands, either as owners, hirers or mortgagers, persons of the I'nited States, It s to be regretted that the disturb object condition of the island of Cuba con tinues to ue a source 01 annoyance anu anxiety. The existence of such a protracted struggle in such ciose prox imity to our own territory, without apparent prospect of an early termi nation, can not lie other than an object of concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference in affairs of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in the uu- disturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty, i . i i i . r e ; " me messing i iree insmui miw. Our naval contmanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it should liecomeneeessary, to spare no effort to protect thelives and property Amerjcan citizeil and to maintain the dignity of the flag. It popwl tllat all pending questions w:t!i Snain crowing out of the affairs Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit eace and conciliation which has hitherto guided tne iwo powers in ineir treatment of such questions. is is DIPLOMATIC CADETS RECOMMENDED IN CHINA AND JAPAN. To irive importance &nd to add to efficiency of our diplomatic re- lations with Japan and China, and to further retain the good opinion of those people, and to secure to the United States its share of the com merce destined to flow between those nations and the balance of the com mercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to sup port at least four American youths in each of these countries, to serve as a part of the official family of our Min government isters there. Our representatives would not even theu be placed upon equality with the representatives lireai x.ritaiu miu wjic uluci j,uw As now situated, our representa , tives in Japan r.nd China have to de- for interpreters and translators natives of those countries, who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services . - r U eirmloves in foreign business hous or the interpreters to other foreign ministers. 1 AID FOR THE PACIFIC STEAMSHIP LINES. I i ( I would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of aiding the American lines of steamers now ply ing between San Francisco aud Spain and China, and the Australian line, almost our only remaining lines of ocean steamers, and of increasing their service. to THE PUBLIC DEBT. ! The national debt has been reduced to the extent of eighty-six millions fifty -seven thousand one hundred and twenty-six dollars and eighty cents during the year; and by the negotia tion of national bonds at a lower rate of interest, the interest on the pub lic debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to lie raised for the interest account is nearly seventeen milliou dollars less than on the 1st of March.

I call your attention to the provisions of the act of Congress, ap proved March 3, lvjfl, which discon tinues promotions in the staff corpsof the army until proviueu ior Dy law. i low. I also recommend that when the office of the chief of a corps be comes vacant the place may be filled by selection from the corps in which the vacancy exists. THE NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the number and efficiency of the naval force, without materia', increase in the expense of supporting it. This is due to the policy, which has been adopted and is being extended as far as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several sta tions. By these means we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger ex tent of cruising ground, to visit more frequently the ports where the presence of our flag is desirable, and generally to discharge more efficiently the appro priate duties of the navy in time of peace, without exceeding the number of men or the expenditures authorized by law. During the past year the navy has, in addition to its regular service, supplied the men and officers for the vessels of the coast survey, and has completed the surveys au thorized by Congress of the Isthmuses of Darien and Tehauntepec, and uu dor the same authority has sent out ! an expedition, completely furnished I and equipped, toexploretheunknown ocean of the North. The suggestions of the report as to the necessity for increasing and improving the mater ial of the navy, and the plan recom mended for reducing the personel of the service to a peace standard, by the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduction of others, and the employment of some in the ser vices of the commercial marine, arc well considered and deserve the thoughtful attention of Congress. I also recommend that all promotions in the navy above captain be by se lection instead of by seniority. This course will secure in the higher grades greater efficiency and hold out an in centive to young officers to improve themselves in the knowledge of their profession. The present cost of main taining the navy, its cost compared Willi Liiai ui u ct;c.iiii jcai, uuu the estimates for the ensuing year, are contained in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy. THE 

POSTAL AFFAIRS. The enlarged receipts of the Post of fice Department, as shown by the ac companying report of the Postmaster General, exhibits a gratifying increase in that branch of the public service. It is the index of the growth of ed ucation and of the prosperity of the people, two elements highly condu cive to the vigor and stability of the republic. With a vast territory like ours, much of it sparsely populated but all requiring the services of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that this department can be made self-sustaining, but a gradual approach to this end from year to year is confi dently relied on, and the day is not far distant when the Postoillce De partment of the government will prove a much greater blessing to the people than it is now. The sugges tions of the Postmaster-General for improvements in the department pre sided over by him are earnestly rec ommended to your special attention, especially the documents for a favora ble consideration of the plan for unit ing the telegraph system of the Uni ted States with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced. It would secure further ad vantage by extending the telegraph through portions of the country where private enterprise will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and, above all, the efforts to bring a people widely separated into a community of inter ests, are always benefitted by a rapid inter-communication. Education, the groundwork of republican institutions, is encouraged by the increasing facil ities to gather speedy news from all parts of the country. The desire to reap the benefit of such improvements stimulate education. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster-General for full details of the operations of last year, and for comparative state ments of the results of former years. THE 

KU-KLUX IN SOUTH CAROLINA. There has lieen imposed upon the executive branch of the government the execution of the act of Congress, approved April 20, 1871, and common ly known as the Ku-Klux law, in a portion of the State of South Carolina. The necessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the committee to investigate South ern outrages. Under the provisions of the above act, I issued a proclama- of the tion calling the attention or the px- 1 r tl... I ; I ut.iw 1. it,. ,. ., m r 111 liic 1 iiiicu ULaiCT lu iiir niur.

After , I ) ; so. : j i of for the passage of this law, information was received, from time to time, that combinat ions of the character referred in this law existed and were power ful in many parts of the Southern States, particularly in certain conn- ties in the State of South Carolina. A careful investigation was made, and was ascertained that in nine coun ties of that State Buch combinations were active and powerful, embracing sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local authority, and having among other things, the object of de priving the emancipated class of the substantial benefits of freedom, and of preventing the free political action of those citizens who did not sympathize with their own views. Among their operations were frequent scourging? and occasional assassinations, gener ally perpetrated at night by disguised persons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of different politi cal sentiments from theirown, or free persons who had shown a disposition claim equal rights with other citi zens. Thousands of inoffensive and well disposed citizens were the sufl'er- . . , 1 . 1 mi is, in bv this lawless violence.

Through the exertions of the various 1 societies of Christians, to whom has been intrusted the execution of the i policy, and the Board of Commission ers authorized by the law of April Id, 1669, many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle on reservations, to cultivate the soil, and perform pro ductive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They i i are being cared for in such a way, it i: hoped, as to induce those still pursu ing their old habits of life to embrace ! the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination.

I recommend to your favora ble consideration also the policy of granting a territorial government to I I I j I the Indians of Indian Territory west of Arkansas and Missouri, and south of Kansas. In doing so every right guaranteed to the Indians by treaty should be secured. Such a course might be the meansof collecting most of the Indians now between the Miss ouri and the Pacific, south of the Brit ish Posessions, into one Territory or one State. The Secretary of the Interior has trea ted upon this subject I recommend to you at length, mill his uii.tioiiu sns:;;' Minns. THE PUBLIC LANDS. I renew my recommendations that 1 the public lands be regarded as a heri- i tage to our children to be disposed of; only as required for occupation and to I actual settlers. Those already grant- ed have been in great part di-qvised of in such a way as to secure accc-s to balance by the hardy settler who I may wish to avail himself of them, J but caution must be used in attaining ' so tiesiraoie au onjeci. iv.iiieaiionai 1 may well be served by the j of the proceeds of tlie sale of 1 puouc lanus to seiners. 1 ao not wish to De understood as recommending, 111 the least degree, a curtailment of what is being dene by the general govern ment for the encouragement of educa tion. THE VARIOUS BUREAUS. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, submitted with this, will give you information collected and prepared for publication in regard to the Census taken during the year 1S70, the operations of the Bureau of Educa tion for the year, tlie Patent Office, the Land Office, and the Indian Bu reau. The report of the Commission er of Agriculture gives the operations of his department for the j'ear. As agriculture is the ground work of our prosperity, too much importance can not be attached to the labors of this department, which is 1:1 the hands of an able head, with able assistants, all zealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of the na tion all useful products adapted to any of the various climates and soils of our vast territory, and to giving all useful information as to the methods of cul tivating the plants, cereals, and other products adapted to particular locali ties. (Quietly, but surely, the Agricul tural Bureau is working a great national good, and, ifliberally suppor ted, the more widely its influence will be extended, and the leas dependent we shall be upon the products of for eign countries. INADEQUATE SALARIES. The subject of compensation to the heads of bureaus and officials holding positions of responsibility, and re quiring ability and character to fill properly, is one to which your atten tion is invited. But few of the offi cers receive a compensation equal to the respectable support of a family, while their duties are such as to in volve millions of interest. In private life services demand compensation equal to the service rendered. A wise economy would dictate the same rule in the government service. THE ESTIMATES FOR NEXT YEAR. I have not given the estimates for the support of the government for the ensuing year, nor the comparative statement between the expenditures for the year just past and the one just preceding, because all these fig ures are contained in the accompany- j ing reports, or in those presented di- j rectly to Congress. These estimates I have my approval. ! GENERAL AMNESTY RECOMMENDED.

A civil service reform which can correct this abuse is much desired. In mercantile pursuits the businessmen who trives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger, is regarded as morally re sponsible for the integrity of his friend and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which would en force this principle against all endors ers of persons for public place would insure great caution in making recom mendations. country in bringing to punishment f,. , , " ":"rl i"".

TIFFIN EDUCATIONAL INTERESTS. An attache orntiir,-- aper, re- of the Toledo (V il writes as follows to that pa lative to liiun fscnoois. The Public Schools were organized substantially upon theirpresent basis by Prof. 1). F. DeWolf, (now of Tole do) in ISM. During his administra tion the main school house, upon Monroe street, was erected and par tially finished. This building con tains eleven school-rooms besides the superintendent's office, a chemi cal laboratory, and a room for philo sophical apparatus. It is surrounded by ample yards that in front of the building lieing reserved for a lawn, and filled with a variety of shade trees. In summer it presents a beau tiful appearance and is unsurpassed in the State. In the rear of the build ing are the play grounds of the chil dren, underdrained and covered with thick coating of fine gravel, form ing a dry play-yard at all spasonsof the year. Although the school roouis are large, airy and scrupulously clean, the style of furniture is decidedly antique. They were placed where they now stand in ISoOand are of the old pat tern that prevailed in our boyhood days, when the favorite theory of ed ucation involved, to the largest ex tent, the element of penance. With these back-breaking seats removed and their places supplied with com fortable modern furniture, and the rooms heated with more modern ap paratus, this school house would rank high among similar structures in the State. On the north side of the river, for merly called Fort Ball, there are two substantial brick buildings used for school purposes, one of them contain- ng five rooms and accommodating 210 pupils and the other but a single room aud being used for an un classified department. The unclassifi ed department, as its name imports, designed for such pupils as fall out the regular grades in the graded schools, and for lioys and girls who can attend school during the winter season only, llie last named by rea The last son of their age, are averse to attend ee the graded departments because, whe" classified according to their at Tbat tainments i.they find themselves strug the z,nS 'tl children much younger than tnemseives. in tins school they are at liberty to select their studies, privilege most or them accept alld r"rsuethe study of arithmetic princi- Pall, learning reading, writing, spell- ng and Keeping accounts. There are also six grades of Ger- man-English pupils German instruc tions alternating each day with Eng lish. The plan of alternate study of Herman ami I-.ngiisli is warmly ad vocated by the Superintendent of the ."schools, less because there is a nu merous Herman element in the city, than because the study of that lan guag is esteemed by him of a high disciplinary character. Pupils of t'uee German schools meet the Eng lish pupils in a common class, in the seventh grade, reaching that point in German and English in the same time that the English pupils do. The schools number at present about one thousand pupils, employing eighteen teachers and one Superin tendent. From the hasty visit paid the building we judu'e that Tiffin children are receiving tlie benefit of "modern improvements" in Is of instruction and are mak- substantial progress Tiio valu mated line of school property is es at ?70,fnN). Two new build ings are soon to lie erected in the out lying sections of the city, for the ac commodation of primary and seconda ry children, Sl-'ixKi having been voted this purpose. When these build ings are supplied, school facilities in Tihin will be fully equal to the wants of the community. The present Superintendent of the Schools, Mr. H. II. Kurness, is one of leading educators of theState, and under ins schools of is in to ed our sun of of by bod all the management, the public j this city will rank with best graded schools in the State, j has an ample corps of assistants, j all departments are working fine- ' ider.

Both sexes are admitted to the Col lege and are allowed to graduate in either of the courses. There have Deen sJ regular graduates of the Col lege, a number of whom are now oc cupying very prominent public posi tions as ministers, lawyers, physi cians, teachers, &e. Very special attention is given to the study of the German lantnia?e aud literature, there being a Profess or who devotes his whole time to this branch. The following gentlemen compose the faculty: He v. G. W. Williard, D. D., Prest. ami Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy ; Bev. B. Good, Prof, of Natural Sciences, and Bector of the Preparatory Depart ment; U. Hornung, A. M., Prof, of -Mathematics; O. A. S. Hursh, A. B., Prof, of Greek and Latin languages; Beu. P. Grading, A. M., Prof, of Ger man language, and Literature; A. S. Zerler, Tutor. There is also connected with the college a Theological Semiuary which is open to all who may desire to qual ify themselves for the minstry. Tlie Rev. J. H. Good, D.D., and Key. H. Bust are the Professors in this Depart ment. About seventy ministers nave been prepared for the preaching of the gospel since its establishment in l.SoO, most of whom are laboring in the BeformeJ Church in Ohio and the Western Sates. The average attendance in the Col lege and Seminary has been about PiO for the last six years. The College is now conducted in a very satisfactory manner and reflects much honor upon its founders and sup porters, while it also forms a very at tractive feature in the general make up of Tiffin. It will be seen by tha foregoing that this city possesses rare education al advantages, a consideration which always has weight with tlie intelli gent heads of families in the selec tion of homes, since it affords an op portunity for the education of their children without subjecting them to the evils which so often attend those who are sent abroad to receive instruc tion in the absence of home influen ces and parental care. R. Communicated. WONDERFUL DEVELOPMENT IN ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE—DISCOVERY OF THE CONSTELLATION TAURUS ENTIRE—A CALCIUM BLAZE UPON A HITHERTO CHIMEREAN SUBJECT. Astronomy is a science which lias engaged the attention of the learned in all ages cf which we have an au thentic,or even obscure record. It has been of immense utility in the pro gress of the science of geography, the art of navigation, and the more familiar occupation of tilling thesoil. The stars have lieen the study of the explorer, historian, navigator and husbandman, and the important events so accurately predicted and destined to transpire, have been fore told by unerring calculation, hundreds of years before their culmination, and by applying similar mathematical formula to the past we have the means of satisfactorily decidins the date of pre-historic events, and thus nas astronomy virtually become the pa rent of chronology. It is probable that ine cuaideans and J-.gyptians were the inventors of Astronomy. We are informed by Josephus that the sons of Seth mployed themselves in fix ing their observations upon pillars of earth and stone, in order to preserve them against the destruction which Adam had foretold should come up on the earth. Hipparchus made the first citalogue of the fixed stars, and was therefore called the father of As tronomy. The first celestial sphere was constructed by Kndoxus, four teen or fifteen hundred years before the christian era, yet the earliest complete system of Astronomy of which we have any knowledge, was formed in the second century at Alexandria, Kgypt. The first Greek philosopher who turned his attention to the contemplation of the heavenly I bodies was 'ihales of Miletus. He! nourished six centuries before Christ, j He was followed by Anaximander. ! Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras and Plato. Alphonzo X, of Castile, in the 13th century, was a patron of the science and encouraged its propaga tion. To Co peruicus a native of Thorn, Prussia, who followed in the 1.1th century, the world is indebted for some of the ablest theories upon the subject. Kepler a German, and Galileo an Italian, succeeded Copernicus as the most learned astronomers of their days, who in their turn were followed by Newton, Herschel, Humboldt and Mitchel. A German citizen of this city, whose name wc withold at his request, until his theories shall have been perfected, has for years been an indefatigable student in pursuit of this intensely in teresting, ami ausoroing study. J-ie has labored diligently.yet quietly, and his nearest neighbors are strangers to the mysteries of his avocation. He seldom speaks of hisjfavorite topic and has never allowed himself to com municate to his most intimate friends the secrets of his profession. His modesty is only equaled by his knowledge of the pursuit to which he wedded. Of late his attention lias been directed more particularly to constellation Taurus, anticipating from various causes and prognostica tions some important developments connection with tlii3 sign of the Zodiac. We are at present permitted divulge the important fact, that his labors have been abundantly reward and his unremitting toil has de veloped new worlds in the planetary system, namely the discovery of the ' entire constellation Taurus. i The ancients originally, or so far as ! information extends, divided the! circle of the heavens, in whicli the apparently moves, into twelve equal parts, now denominated signs the Zodiac. Taurus constituted one these signs, yet the most indefatiga ble research and diligent investigation philosophers and savaus since the days jif Hipparchus or Ptolemy 1 have utterly failed to reveal more 1 than a partial view of this celestial j v.
