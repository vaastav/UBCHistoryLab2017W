W. L DOUGLAS' Ti. _ . . i- Manufacturer Thinks Government Should Obtain Publicity by a License System. .Large business organizations have come to slay. We cannot go back to old conditions. We must meet world competition. Large concerns can produce - duce goods at lower cost than small ones. Germany favors large corpora- lions. The method of the present na tional administration is to dissolve the great organizations and make them smaller , which is a backward step. There should be no limit to a corporation doing a large and legiti mate business , such as would be pos sible under the licensing plan which I favor , writes W. L. Douglas , former governor of Massachusetts , in the Boston Herald. Prejudices against corporations merely because they are big , perhaps , * nust be done away with. They give labor better returns. They cheapen product and thus benefit the consum er. They give opportunities to small investors who get returns otherwise -unattainable. They employ able young men who have no capital at all , but who receive handsome sal aries for their ability and service. In place of the Sherman law it Is any opinion there should be a depart ment at Washington to grant licenses to all manufacturers and corporations In this country who do an Interstate commerce business. The law should be made so clear , plain and definite that it could not be misunderstood. It should require all capital to be paid in full. Semi-yearly statements should be given to the { public and certified by a public ac countant There should be a board ODf examiners in each state to look aft er these corporations just as our na tional banks are watched by the na tional government. They should have ithe right to enter the offices and ex amine the records of all the direc torates of these companies. Naive Optimists. "Six months ago tnere was another outburst of optimism as naive as .3n ithough the world were still living in the sentimental era of glass exhibi id tions. Since then there has opened another era of political earthquakes ! and conflagrations , and the area of disturbance continues to extend. Be fore the Tripoli problem has been safely liquidated or the peace of the Balkans is assured , we have the out burst in China of an insurrection which may change the face of the far east and give an incalculable increase of force to all the impulses set mov ing by the triumph of Japan. All we can be certain of in the region of -world politics is that nothing is cer tain. Do we need further lessons ra convince us that the peace of civilization aa tion is founded upon the crust of a Tolcano ? " asks the London Observer. No Insomnia Here.

I grew so weak that atw the exertion of walking , if only a few tfeet , made it necessary for me to lie down. My friends thought I was marked for consumption weak , thin : and pale. "I realized the danger I was in and idd tried , faithfully to get relief from medicines - dn -icines , till , at last , after having em ployed all kinds of drugs , the doctor -acknowledged that he did not believe tit was in his power to cure me.

DECISIONS ARE DEFENDED Dissolution Plans of Standard Oil and Tobacco Explained Federal In corporation and Commission Recommended. Washington. President Taft's annual message , which was read In both houses of congress Tuesday , deals exclusively with the anti-trust statute. The message In part is as follows : To the Senate and House of Represent atives : This mesage Is the first of sev eral which I shall send to congress during the interval between the opening of its regular session and its adjournment for the Christmas holidays. The amount of Information to be communicated as to the operations of the government , the number of Important subjects calling for comment by the executive , and the trans mission to congress of exhaustive re ports by special commissions , make it im possible to include in one message of a reasonable length a discussion of the top ics that ought to be brought to the at tention of the national legislature at its first regular session. Decisions of Supreme Court. In May last the Supreme court handed flown decisions In the suits in equity brought by the United States to enjoin the . further maintenance of the Standard 01 ] trust and of the American Tobacco trust , and to secure their dissolution. The de are epoch-making and serve to ad the business world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti trust law of 1890. The deci ons do not depart ; In any substantial way from the previous decisions of the court In construing Inj and applying this important statute , bu they clarify those important decisions by further defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal construction of the act. By the decrees , they furnish a useful precedent as to the proper method of dealing with the capital and property of Illegal trusts. These decisions sug gest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make it easier for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality thus finally established and to preserve the benefit , freedom and spur of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress. It has been said that the court , by in troducing into the construction of the statute common law distinctions , has emasculated it. This Is obviously untrue. By its Judgment every contract and com bination in restraint of interstate trade made with the purpose , or necessary ef fect of controlling prices by stifling com petition , or of establishing in whole or In part a monopoly of such trade , is con demned by the statute. The most ex treme crltllcs cannot Instance a case that ought to be condemned under the statute which is not brought within Us terms as thus construed. The sugestlon is also made that the Su preme court by its decisions In the last two cases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited discretion to de termine whether a case of restrainj of trade Is within the terms of the statute. This is wholly untrue. A reasonable re straint of trade at common law is well understood and is clearly defined. It does not rest in the discretion of the court. It must be limited to acompllsh the purpose of a lawful main contract to which , In order that it shall be enforceable at all , It must be incidental. If It exceeds the needs of that contract It Is void. Methods of Dissolution. In the Standard Oil case the Supreme and circuit courts found the combination to be a monopoly of the Interstate busi ness of refining , transporting , and mar keting petroleum and its products , effect ed and maintained through thirty-seven different corporations , the stock of which was held by a New Jersey company. It in effect commanded the dissolution of this combination , directed the transfer and pro-rata distribution by the New Jer sey company of the stock held by it in the thirty-seven corporations to and among its stockholders , and the corpora tions and Individual defendants were enJoined - Joined from conspiring or combining to restore such monopoly ; and all agree ments betwen the subsidiary corporations tending to produce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined. In the Tobacco case , the court found that the individual defendants , twenty- nine in number , had been engaged in a successful effort to acquire complete do > minion over the manufacture , sale , and dy distribution of tobacco In this country and abroad , and that this had been done by combinations made with a purpose : and effect to stifle competition , control Jlt prices , and establish a monopoly , not only in the manufacture of tobacco , but its also of tin-foil and licorice , used in Its : manufacture and of its products of cigars l- lo gars , cigarettes and snuffs. The tobacco : suit presentend a far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil il.e suit for a decree which would effectuate the will of the court and end the viola tion of the statute. There was here L.0 single holding company as In the case of the Standard Oil trust. The main com pany was the American Tobacco com pany , a manufacturing , selling and holdIng - Ing company. The plan adopted to de stroy the combination and restore compe tition Involved the redivlslon of the capi in a.i tal and plants of the whole trust between some of the companies constituting the trust and new companies organized for the purposes of the decree and made par ties to It , and numbering , new and old , fourteen. Purpose Not Confiscation. It Is not the purpose of the statute to : confiscate the property and capital of the offending trusts. Methods of punishment by : fine or Imprisonment of the Individual offenders | , by fine of the corporation , ilr by forfeiture of its goods in transportation - tion , are provided , but the proceeding iin equity Is a specific remedy to stop the operation ] of the trust by Injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital in violation of the statute. I venture to say that not in the history Did as He Was Told. A young Irishman from a remote : .part of Ireland recently secured a berth as barman at a hotel in Mann Chester. The first morning at ad o'clock young Murphy was instructed ( I to light the lamps outside. This he lee proceeded to do very businesslike , but half an hour later could not be > found. Inquiries were made , and v eventually Murphy was seen about i atQ 7:30 lighting a lamp near Middleton , E having lit all the lamps on the RochI aa. dale road for about four miles. Ideas. I of American law has a decree more ef fective for such a purpose been entered by a court than that against the Tobacco trust. It has been assumed that the present pro-rata and common ownership In all these companies by former stockholders of the trust would Insure a continuance of the same old single control of all the companies Into which the trust has by decree been disintegrated. This Is er roneous and is based upon the assumed Inefficacy - efficacy and Innocuousness of judicial In junctions. The companies are enjoined from co-operation or combination ; they have different managers , directors , pur chasing and sales agents. If all or any of the numerous stockholders , reaching into the thousands , attempt to secure concerted action of the companies with a view to the control of the market , their number is so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed and Its prime movers and all Its participants would b at once subject to contempt proceedings and imprisonment of a summary charac ter. The Immediate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all the companies under different man agers and then competition most follow , or there will be activity by one company an stagnation by another. Cry for Repeal of Law. But now that the anti-trust act Is seen to be effective for the accomplishment of the purpose of Ite enactment , we are met by a cry from many different quarters for its repeal. It Is said to tte "obstructive of business progress , to be an attempt to restore old-fashioned methods of de structive competition between small units , and to make impossible those useful com binations of capital and the reduction of the cost of production that are essential to continued prosperity and normal growth. In the recent decisions the Supreme court makes clear that there Is nothing In the statute which condemns comblnaI tions of capital or mere bigness of plant organized to secure economy in producIn tion and a reduction of its cost. It is only when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or the aggregation of immense - mense size are the stifling of competition , actual and potential , and the enhancing of prices and establishing a monopoly , that the statute Is violated. J j For Federal Incorporation. i In a special message to congress on January 7 , 1910 , I ventured to point out the disturbance to business that would probably attend the dissolution of these offending trusts. I said : ( "But such an Investigation and pos- 1 slble prosecution of corporations whose prosperity or destruction affects the comfort not only of stockholders but of millions of wage earners , employes , and associated tradesmen must necesqu sarily tend to disturb the confidence of the business community , to dry up the | now flowing sources of capital from its , places of hoarding , and produce a halt : In our present prosperity that will | cause suffering and strained circum ! stances among the innocent many for the fault of the g-ullty few. The quesCO tion which I wish In this message to bring clearly to the consideration and discussion of congress Is whether , in | I order to avoid such a possible business dauger , something cannot be done by which these business combinations may [ be offered a means , without great finan ' cial disturbance , of changing the char . acter , organization and extent of their business Into one within the lines of the law under federal control and su- pervlslon , securing compliance with tha anti-trust statute. j | "Generally , in the Industrial combl- nations called Trusts. ' the principal j business is the sale of goods in many states and in foreign markets ; In other words , the Interstate and foreign busl- ! ness far exceeds the business done 1m any one state. This fact will Justify the federal government In granting a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell In Interstate and for eign commerce the products of useful j manufacture under such limitations as i will secure a compliance with the antl- f trust law. It is possible so to frame a statute that while It offers protec- | i tion to a federal company against j i harmful , vexatious and unnecessary i invasion by the states. It shall subject It to reasonable taxation and control by the states with respect to its pure- ly local business. I "Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited from acqulrto j ing and holding stock In other corporaga ' tions ( except for special reasons , upon | approval by the proper federal authorj j Ity ) , thus avoiding the creation under I national auspices of the holding com- | i pany with subordinate corporations In different states , which has been such an J , effective agency in the creation of the great trusts and monopolies. "If the prohibition of the anti-trust ' act against combinations In restraint of trade is to be effectively enforced , It Is essential that the national govern ment shall provide for tne creation of national corporations to carry on a legitimate business throughout the United States. The conflicting laws of the different states of the Union with respect to foreign corporations makes it di cult , if not impossible , for one corporation to comply with their re quirements so as to carry on business in a number of different states. " Federal Commission Proposed. I do not set forth In detail the terms and sections of a statute which might supply the constructive legislation permit ; ting and aiding the formation of combina tions of capital Into federal corporations. They should be subject to rigid rules as to their organization and procedure , In cluding effective publicity , and to tha closest supervision as to the Issue of j stock and bonds by an executive bureau , j or commission in the department of \ commerce and labor , to which In times of doubt they might well submit their pro posed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood that incorpora tion under a federal law could not ex empt the company thus formed and Its incorporators and managers from prose cution under the anti-trust law for sub sequent llegal conduct , but the publicity of its procedure and the opportunity for frequent consultation as to the legitimate purpose of its transactions would offer It as great security against successful prosecutions for violations of the law as would be practical or wise. I recommend that the federal charters thus to be granted shall be voluntary , at least until experience justifies mandatory provisions. The benefit to be derived from ] the operation of great businesses under the protection of such a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep within the lines of the law. Other large combinations that fail to take advantage of the federal Incorporation will not have a right to complain if their failure Is ascribed to unwillingness to submit their transactions to the careful scrutiny , competent supervision and publicity at tendant upon the enjoyment of such a charter. Fame of Li Hung Chang. There are far too many famous men nowadays , and it is not easy to re member exactly who is who. They were discussing the Chinese situation In : the bar and the man who had vis ited China began to give his views. "Do you remember Li Hung Chang ? > " he began. "I knew him well. " To which the sporting-looking gentleman in : the corner answered , "What ? Re member him ? I saw him last night Best music hall juggler I've seen for ta time. " London Chronicla.
