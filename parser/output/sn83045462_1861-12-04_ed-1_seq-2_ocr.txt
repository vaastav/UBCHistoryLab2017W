MILITARY BUDGET. MII.ITABT JIBORAffTlC*. I Very many of our reader* are familiar with the mode of taking balloon rbeenratlona for military purposes as conducted by Prof Lrwe, but they 1 mar not be aware that the ?Mal observations ' mads bv Prof La Mountain (stationed Mar the j Alexandria Seminary) with th? same object are , carried out upon an entirely different system.

Professor La Mountain, acting 3pen the theory to which be has given some yeais' study, that balloon trsvel may be regulated with precision by taking advantage <f the contrary currents of air which it Is believed always prevail at different elevations, launches boldly forth Into the heavens and sails away down over Dixie's land, high above the bead* of astonished secesL. Hovering over Jeff-Dav's-dom at an elevation of from one to two miles (well out of rifle range), the ftrnnmt urith hmr ?vm nnt?? mioht (hat man K# deemed of Interest at military headquarters; and then, when secesb? who hat been following him with wrathful eye?imagines the luckless voyager to be drifting, helpless, rig*t into his clutches, down comet a silver shower of sand ballast, and up leaps the balloon a peg higher Into the heavens, strikes the couuter currcnt, and *alM saucily beck to the domain of the stars and stripes. Prof. La Mountain has made six successful reconnolterlng excursion# upon this theory within the last month and a half, going down over the enemy's lines with the sub-current and Mom. Injs by the counter-current Sometimes an elevation of something like four milt s has been de manaea ere rtactiing tue counter-current, but it haa alwava been found. Without douHt the aid Incidentally given to balloon experimenting by Government, during tbe pretent war, will enable rc-onauts t? collect valuable data in furtherance of their inveatigationa. i Prof La Mountain baa with him Mr. A Ken, drlrk, aaaiatar.t, and Mr N.
