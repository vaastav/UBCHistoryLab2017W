NO. 53 POMONA GIRLS LIKED HIM Now They Mourn His Sudden De parture for New Fields HIS NAME IS V. J. HUMBRECHT Aid He Ii Alleged to Belong to the Smart People Class Aa Account ol Hie Career In Pomona, and What Is Supposed te be His Antecedents POMONA, Dec. 2.—Pomona has never before had v sensation quite like those ■he has experienced in tbe past week. A young man, who bad the name, at least in Pomona, of Victor J. II urn bred) t and who has been a favorite in society in j tbat quiet little city, has been missing from Pomona for a week, and not only have tbe officers of tbe law in that place been searching for htm with no success, but there nave come communications from Chicago and Portland, Ore. to tho effect that a young man whose descrip tion answers perfectly tbat of Hum brecbt, is wanted elsewhere for criminal acta. Sometime last March or April a tall, slender man of about .10 years came to Pomona. He had Hashing black eyes, a small coal black moustsche, an easy car riage, a good command of complimentary I phrases and an affected familiarity with I every part ot the United States ard an I acquaintance with any r.umrm of mil- > liouaires. lie dressed always in extreme fashion and spent money liberally. No man in Pomona was ever so gereriil a fa vorite among young ladies, 'as Htim breiht bad the entree to a number ot the best houses bers and was wined and dived frequently. A« time wore on Hum brecbt became more exclusive in Ins attentions, and nad many silent admirers among tbe young ladies, who looked with en- vious eyes upon lb* f ishmnable young rnno as tie drove about the alt ey with anyone of bis sx or seven selected b-st girls. About six week-* ago a sud.lcn end very perception thame camo over tho fortunes irf Mr. lluninreubt. He com lilnined tbat bis mother mas in Europe, ■nd in her travels and enlert iinuicnt by tlie h istocraoy, sbe had faile Ito send her eon Victor his monthly remittance of H230. Ot course, there were any numnar of tbe unsuspecting goo.) people of Po mons wbo were glad to aid the young man in his time of financial embarrassment. He borrowed money right and left, ran hills witb merchants ami ceased to pay Sirs, Utter mine money tor board and his suits of rooms, But among the young people, especially among the young la dies, who yet te pained whole heart and fancy free, he n a ruined bis oln-timn popularity. A week ago las. Sunday Humorecht said be thought he would run over to Ontario for a day or two on a visit to an old college cbuin who was spending the winter there. It was not until two days later that there were suspicion! uf Hum urecht's llight. It was found that be went to Loa Angeles and never went to On tario. Three I'oraona police officers have searched lung ami hard for Huinbrechl. end no trace can be found of him, There ia reason at this present writing to believe tne smooth fellow was in Lower Califor nia ueiore tbe officers got on his truck. It is estimated tbat he cost Pomomuis some if luu in cool cash. Many persons in tbo town have wondered why the young man hastened his rlicht irom Pomona, where t,e had a pretty snug thing in tho confldene of the people,off from whom he could live. It has developed in ihe past few days that Humbrecht must nave had some word of warning from a confederate or relative that detectives who have Had bim in mind for several years bad once more located their game and were mak ing ready to bag it neatly and quietly. The polioe bere will not speak very much on tbe subject. There are well founded minors, however, tbat Mr. Humbrecht is about as smooth and able a confidence man as may bo found in the west. His manner of operation ia unique, und he has work id it well in Chicago, Astoria and Portland, Ore., Bait Lake C'itv and some towns in Texas. Descriptionsof a young man known in Astoria as Ueorge Avery and wanted thete for robbing a confiding widow of a large amount of jewelry lit those < f Victor J. Humbrecht. The de scriptions of George Avery answer exactly those of a young man who was known in Kvanston, a suburb of Chicago, in 1892, as Charles Hunter, only Hunter woro a heavy beard that he kept constantly dyed. It is recalled by a few in Pomona tbat Humbrecht brought black bair dye her.'. It seems that this Hunter is wanted for raising a check from $30 to Sduiiii, and for walking away at the same lime with some money tin old lady who took an inte est in Hunter gave him to deposit for ber. The check was drawn, by herself. Hunter {was traced from Kvanston to Denison, Tex., and from there to Mobile, Ala. Tbe Chicago peo ple heard no more of the young fellow's whereabouts until lait winter, when he had just left Portland, Ore., ann known there as Aultry. It was supposed he was in British Columbia until a lew weeks YON

This tends to make I tbe matter more delicate co handle, as to i demonstrate that sucb is not tbe case is almost certain to lead to an outbreak even more serious than tbc ope which gave a pretext for the demand for extra cuardsbips. A Turkish official, diicnss ing the withdrawal of the Dryad, inti- I mated that the powers objected to any | power taking the lean iri any notion in lurkey. In other words,,if acton Is to be taxeu. it sbould be combined action upon the part of the powers. Thus it is intimate.l that if the passage of the Danism lies is tv be forced, it should be i done by warships of all the bowers in i terested. 1 his was the original under j standing, but ureal Britain, it appears. , woe not disposed; to delay matters beyond i a certain point.

GENERAL CAMPOS TALKS Of His Ability to Re establish Peace in Cuba IF MATANZAS IS REACHED Tbe Conditions Will Become Very Much More Serious The Burning of Sugar Cane Is Referred to as indicating Dissent!in Among the Insurgents Associated Press Sneclal Wire. HAVANA, Dcc.L'.-(Special correspon dence to tho Associated Press.)— The re port which was cabled to the United States, to tiie cffucl that ihti insurgent leader Kego had surrendered with 250 followcis at Cienfuegos has proven false by subsequent events, hut the report whs received from reliable sources. Since November Btb it has been known to your correspondert that Kego had made a pro posal ot surrender, which bad been sub milted to Captain-General Campos througu two intermediaries, who had accepted tne offer. Tma information came from an employee in the foreign i otlice. with permission to wire the in formation as being already an accepted fact. ' General Campos, in reply to inquiries : telegraphed from Santa Clara, asserts ! that he has more confidence than ever ! that he will bo abls to re establish peace. I "file more so," he continues, "if lam | able to prevent Maximo Gomez from en i taring the province ot Matanazs." This would be adifhoult feat for Gomez, sa d General Ca.npos. and not likely to be accomplished ut present. J General Campos telegraphs: "Gomez is jat the shores ol th» river Jatibonico and i is ratncr deceived as to his chiefs in San 'tu Clara provinca, who have not proved I equal to his hope?. ] General Campos doubts whether Gomez I will attempt to enter Matanzas, as he has I made no perceptible movement from | where he is, and tnarefore General Cam | pos, with the reinforc;monts which he !is expecting, is sure to crush the rebel lion in Santa Clara. | But General Campos includes a proviso ; with this opinion, that If.against his ex ! pecfatioi!, Gomez shall penetrate Matanzas j province, the revolution would assume : very serious proportions. The captain ! general said tnrtuer that be was momen i tarilv expecting the surrender of '-'50 in- j I enrgents at Cienfuegoi, which will great- , I ly favor his plans. With regard to Rego, General Campos' dispatch says that he bus no doubt Keuo lias permission to surrender. Continu ing, the dispitcb says: "If the plan mis ' carried, as I am informed hy the chief of that section, it is due to the fact that it became public, but there still exists nine out of ten chances that it will yet become an accepted fact.' The burning of tbe sugar cane on the plantation of Soledad is offered as proof of ihe uisomer in the insurgent ranks, as there existed a compromise wltti Kego that the plantations should be respected. The capt iin with Kego, who was lorm i erly a corporal of tho civil guard, has left bim, and manifests a desire to leave the opposition, other leaders have also left Kego, and l.ieut-nant-Colonel Gon zales, a negn , had a b'tter dispute with bim after tne engagement at Barjagus.
