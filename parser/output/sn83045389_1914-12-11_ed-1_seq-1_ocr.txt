MMII'ICHS SI'MAKS OX KICI.ATIO.VS WITH JAPAN Samuel (iompers, president of the American Federation of I^-ibor, address ing the meeting of the council yester day afternoon, expressed the hope, that ; members of the council's commission [ on relations with Japan will succeed in | bringing about an amicable adjustment ! of labor differences in the Pacific Coast States. Dr. Sidney 1* Guiick, of Dosh Isha University, Japan, a well-known authority on the Japanese situation and 1 head of the council's commission on re lations with Japan, is now working with labor Naders on the I'acillc Coast ii; an effort to bring about conciliatory action on the part of organized labor in that locality on the one hand, and tiie Japanese on the other. "Within the past month," said Mr. J (.iompers In his speech, "I have been several times In conference with Dr. (iullck with regard to the situation on ti)o Pacific Coast. As a result of these conferences, l)r. Macfarland and Dr. GuIlCk havo not only comu to Phila delphia.^ .attend the annual convention of the ApH'fMean Federation of I^abOr, but Dr. Gulick has mat a number of the most Influential labor leaders from the-Pacillc>Coast States, and they have gone, over together the matter of try ing to find some adjustment of the conflicting Interests of the world ngmen , and the Japanese of California. "We certainly welcome the aid of the Federal Council In our task of light ening th>- burdens of the working peo ple of tills land." 

THOUSANDS ()F DIMKiltAVI'S PHKSK.VT SKHUH S IHtOIII,KH | Mr. Gompers made the point that the . thousands of foreign laborers that are j constantly pouring into America from j all sides present many perplexing prob- | lems. lie said that in many instances ' hundreds of foreigners are induced to j come to America by great business en- ! t? rprises, whose sole idea is financial j gain. "We must work with the ma- ! ferial we have at hand," said Mr. j Gompers, "and strive to show to these i workmen their duties and obligations, I thereby making better, men of them. I We must strive to protect the weak I against the oppression of the strong, I and to make to-day better and bright er than yesterday and to-morrow bet ter than to-day. We are governed by no 'isms' or 'creeds:' we have the hard, concrete problem of life with which to oeai. and we must devote all of our efforts to the solution of the problem." Dr. Gulick and President Shaller Mathews wore named by tlie executive committee of the council as n special deputation to continue an Investiga tion of the labor-Japanese problem In the Pacific Coast States, and later to go to Japan to convey to the people of that country a message from Chris tian Americans, to be drafted by a committee of nine members of the council, appointed yesterday. with Bishop E. It. Ilendrix, of the Metho dist Episcopal Church, St. I?ouls, Mo., os chairman. MPKCIAl. 

DISPUTATION TO IIKAII MISSMAfiK TO JAI'A.V Final action In the matter wns takr-n in the soshIoii lust night when the council passed n resolution authorizing the appointment of Dr. Gullck and Dr. Mathews as a special deputation to the Japanese peopl" hearing a message from the Koderal Council of the Churches of Christ in America as rep resenting the sentiment of the Chris tian people of this country. Dr. dullclc, who was to have deliv erer! an address before the council last night, left early yesterday for Washington, accompanied by Or. Mathows. At the session last night l)r. Mathews said: "I have Just come from Washington. Dr. Gullck and I spout all day with President Wilson, Hocretary 11 r.van and the Japanese am bassador. All three showed the great est Interest and approval In our pro posed visit. Kor some time there has been a. discussion among us as to whether the present time is opportune for this visit on account of the Kuro penn crisis. "Wo Anally caine to the conclusion that this was Just the time to carry to Japan a message from the Christian churches. It Is not culture or civiliza tion which we will present, but the spirit of Jesus Christ and tho principle of faith in the everlasting God." 

SAVS WILSON'S VIRWS WII.L BK RKCEIVICD WITH DISTRUST Dr. Gullck, of Doshlslin University, Tokyo, is quotod as expressing the opinion that the views of President Wilson In his annual message on the subject of preparedness will bo re ceived with suspicion, and distrust by Japan. "President Wilson practically agroes with all those who think that we need a strong navy," said Dr. Gu llck. "Japan will think that we want a strong navy for the purpose of dom !| Inatlng the oceans.

PRESENT FARES TO BE RETAINED, SAYS ANDERSON Vice-President of V: R. & P. Co. Defenc^ Franchise Application. CORPORATION HAS FIXED UPON NO DEFINITE PLAN Asks for Advice of People in' Framing Equitable and Fair Ordinance. WENDBNBURO ATTACKS GRANT Calls Petition and Suggested Fran chise "Hold and Outrageous Proposition." "The Virginia Railway an<1 Power Company has no more Idea of suggest ing to tlie Council the withdrawal of the Hchool and labor tickets than It h?H of making; the street car fare In this city $1," declared Vice-President .and General Counsel Henry W. Ander son. of that company, addressing a mflss-meetlng of Kast End citizens on the franchise application at the Chlm- j borazo Public School last night. "I ? will give you a written _ communica tion to that effect if you want It. "It appears that the Company's po sition has been entirely misunderstood. The ordinance of the city required It In submitting a petition for a new [ franchise to accompany such petition with at least a tentative draft of the franchise ordinance that is desired. Wo would have preferred to submit no or dinance at all. The ordinance we sug gested oontains many things which we would prefer not to have In It. and omits things we should like to have In It. 

COMPANY HAS SO DKFIMTK l'l,AX j "This altogether tentative ordinance has been represented as a plan which we will not permit to be modified. On 1 that assumption the company has been i attacked and its motives questioned. I say to you that the company has no ' definite plan. If you don't like the tentative plan we have ausgeotsd, ! change It. -Get together and say what you want. The company desires to render a good service, and it needs you to help It determine what service will best answer your needs. "We enn't arrive at this understand ing by throwing bricks at one another. I It you have any suggestions to offer come with us before the Street Com-' mittee, which has the matter under consideration, and let us all discuss It together. Vou can't solve the problem in meetings of this kind, and you can't I settle It by adopting resolutions, j SO DESIRE TO KVX C'OXTKAKV TO PUIIMC SEXTIMBST "The company has no desire to run contrary to public sentiment. it has been the aim of every man connected with this company, as far as I know, to meet every reasonable demand. We want to keep in step with public sen timent. What we ask is a dispassion ate consideration of the question, and that will be accomplished only by get ting together, and not by throwing bricks." Mr. Anderson spoke for forty min uter, heading a quartet of speakers on the franchise application. It was the first public expression of the Vir ginia Hallway and Power Company hi a ring directly upon its pending ap plication to vthe Council, and it was delivered, to all appearances, in the enemy's country. After Mr. Anderson, spoke Attorney Louis O. Wendenburg. who denounced the Virginia Hallway and Power Com pany's petition and suggested fran chise as a "bold and outrageous propo sition" fraught with danger to citizens present and yet unborn. Following him came .1 oseph W. Stewart, a mem ber of the board of directors of the Church Hill Bank, who announced his intention to fight the company's appli cation to the bitter end, unless it were modified to lit the wishes of Church Hill. Next came James Dickers.-??, prominent in Church JIlll politics, who denounced the company's proposition in language still a shade more vig orous. I.AllCK 

UDIKMK RIi.\Its SI'KIiCIIBS Through the whole hostile proceeding In a front seat on the platform sat Vice-President Kritz Sltterding, of the Virginia Hallway and .Power Com pany. In near-by seats were Alder men Nelson and Councilman Sullivan, of Jefferson Ward, and a prominent ar ray of Kast-Knd citizens. The audi torium lield a crowd of 350. Mr. Dlckerson, the last speaker on the program, wound up his address with a spirited appeal to the assem blage to adopt unanimously the reso lutions submitted to the mass-meeting at the beginning of the evening. In an amplified form, the resolutions re peated the demands enumerated in the resolutions adopted recently by the three ISast-Knd organizations, under whose joint auspices last night's meet ing was held. K. II. Wakefield, of the Kast-Knd Progressive Association, presiding over the mass-meeting, read a brief state ment to the effect that, tne meeting had now heard argument pro and con, and that it was In order to vote on the resolutions. He called upon all those ! who favored the adoption of the reso- i lutlons to arise and hold up their right j hands. The mass arose.

The presiding ofllcer stood by J the desk with gravel poised while ! cries of "sit down" and "put him out," ! caine from different parts of the hall. "1 am opposed to the resolutions ' that have been offered, because I do j not think' that this Is the proper time or place to adopt them," said Mr. Gal lagher. "This body will act ? more wisely, in my opinion, if It will con tinue the committee which drew up these ? resolutions, and Instruct It to confer with the company's representa tives and the Council authorities. Af ter that it could draw up resolutions and place them before us for consid eration." Cries calling upon the speaker to sit down or "shut up" became more In sistent, but Mr. Gallagher faced the audience nntl continued: "The trnfttlon situation In thin city Is I not peculiar.

INSTITUTE SHOULD BE PART OF CITY'S SCHOOLSYSTEM Survey Committee of Indus trial Education Society Submits Report. WOULD MAKE PLANT VOCATIONAL CENTRE I , I Favors Merging Virginia Me-| chanics' Institute With Public Schools of Richmond. DAY CLASSES ARK NEEDED Evening Schools and Part-Time In dustrial Classes Strongly Recommended. At the meeting of the purvey com mittee of tho National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education yesterday afternoon it was recom mended that the Virginia Mechanics' Institute be merged with the public school system of Richmond, In accord ance with the following plan: "That the corporate name of the Vir ginia Mechanics' Institute shall be pre served, but that the ownership of its property shall be vested in the city of Richmond. "That an ordinance be passed by the City Council of Richmond which shall provide that the immediate direction of the affairs of the Mechanics' Insti tute shall be under an advisory board of five members, one member from each city school district, and two members at large: and that the management of the Institute shall be under the gen eral direction of the City School Hoard, to be used for public school purposes In connection with- both the day and evening rchool work. "That the City School Hoard of Richmond shall agree to make this plant the vocational centre of the pub I lie school system and open the Instl i tute In the daytime as soon as prac | tlca! after this merger shull have been I accomplished. I "In the event that this merger can he brought about In accordance with the above plan, it will be possible to make the Virginia Mechanics' Institute serve the public school system of the entire city for both day and night classes for practically the whole year, and the institute would be eligible, as an Institution supported ami controlled by the public, to participate In the dis tribution of the funds which will be available in the event of tho granting of Slate moneys for industrial or com mercial education to the local commu nities of Virginia, or in the event of the passage of the industrial education bill now pending before the Congress of the United States." WANTS EVEMJVCi SCHOOLS OF IXDUSTK1AI, OlIDI'lt It was recommended that* schools and courses for beys and mer. already employed should find expression In i wo I great groups: (1) evening schools of i industrial order and of general order; i (2) part-time schools, of like orders, j and that schools of the industrial ' order should take most decidedly the trade extension aspect. It was also recommended that steps be taken at once by tho Richmond school authori ties to establish part-time day schools or classes for those industries and plants where employers have expressed a willingness to co-operate In this way. There is need, the report says, for evening classes in salesmanship, and need for department store and sales manship training, through pnrt-time and continuation classes. A practical arts course of more advanced and spe cialized character should he offered in the regular high school for girls who have graduated from the elementary school or the Junior high school, and entered the high school' for more gen eral training, and it Is recommended that there be established schools or classes in prevocational work for girls, covering the period corresponding to the last two years of the elementary school. An outline of the studies to be taught Is given In the report. A | separate department Is to be given to | the practical arts, the t report stating that opportunities are opening up in Richmond for numerous wage-earning and salaried callings, which are based upon a very practical, as well as sclen tltic, knowledge of home economics. MCKI) I'"Oil IMHT TIME CHI COXTIN I'ATIOX CI,ASSES Because of the great need of further training for the large army of girls under sixteen years of age who become wage-earners before completing the elementary schools, the school authori ties. the report says, should make a special effort to induce employers ?t? co-operate voluntarily by giving their j young workers time to attend a part- ! time or continuation school or class for j at least four hours a week. The. survey shows that there is a de- ' mand in Richmond for provocation^ j training for children more than tliir- j teen years of age and no demand at | present for any type of all-day Indus- | trial or trade school; and the commit- | tee recommends, there/ore, that the Richmond schools develop as rapidly as possible schools or classes in prevoca tional training, admitting hoys who havs completed the work of the 5B grade and who look forward to leav ing school at a relatively early age in order to go to work, and who need the help of the school in reaching a deci sion as to what line of work they may enter with the greatest prospect of suc cess. Prevocational training, the re port says, should provide vocational di rection and guidance for children who arc likely to face the complexities of modern Industrial and commercial life. It must give them an experience'and a knowledge which will servo as a basis upon which an intelligent choice of a life career may be made.
