Manila, December 1: The force of constabulary under Major Murphy surprised the camp of Pablo, chief of the Pulajanes, on the Island of S&mar yes- , terday and eleven Pulajanes were killed and ten wounded. Pablo escaped, but his wife and daughter were captured. All the clothing, arms and papers found were destroyed, together with the camp.

The trouble about the discharged I negro soldiers seems to be spreading, Major Penrose, commander of the battalion, is now Involved by reason of having talked too much. He is al- ~ leged to have declared, so the New York Times reports, that his men were the best disciplined soldiers in the army, and in other ways reflected on q the wisdom of their discharge. The ' war department is preparing a call on ? him for an explanation of the interview. If the report of the interview is substantiated Major Penrose will th have to face the court-martial that fQ he escaped on account of the riot. .

With this perfectly genuine 'r check she made her way to a bank and R< presented it.

Washington special of December 2, Sp to News and Courier: Secretary Wil- on son's annual report announces that the department of agriculture has succeed- du ed in developing a new variety of ear- thi ly cotton, particularly suited for grow- ( ing in the region infested by the Mexican boll weevil. The work of the de- Sl( partment in Texas shows that the in- foi sects do not multiply fast enough early <ju in the season to damage seriously that part of the crop that matures early, and by cleaning up the ground and he burning the stalks after the cfop has pa been gathered the number ofMnsects that live through the winter can be greatly reduced. The new variety will rei mature a large proportion of its yield gy before the weevil becomes most de- sir structive, and the entire crop will be out of the way in time to permit of the cleaning of the ground early in the p" fall. In addition to being earlier than th< any other variety ever cultivated, this 9h, variety is described by Secretary Wil- .. son as being productive with fairly large bolls. The outlook for the control 1 of the weevil is regarded by the de- ml partment as being much improved by the discovery that in the Brownsville 1 region, where it first appeared in 1893, on it is being attacked by native parasites coi and its numbers much reduced. ' on ? Madrid, December 1: Juan Aldige, rei the proprietor of a gambling den at Pamafior, near Seville and Manuel sy Munez, his assistant, have just been Inl executed on a charge of murder. Al- of dige enticed innumerable travelers into . his house, which stood in an isolated part of the town and then fleeced them on by cheating at cards. The victims lat who protested or who even showed that st, they had discovered his trickery were killed by Aldige with a hammer, and M< their bodies were then buried in his no garden. The condemned men shocked th< even the gaolers by their callousness, and when on the scaffold laughed and joked with each other. Munez talked l's continuously, and when the priest beg- w ged him to keep silence during the m, reading of certain prayers, the criminal replied: "I am going to talk as "a long as I have the chance, for I shall res be dead for a long time." Both men fQ1 were garrotted in the usual manner. When the collar was placed around Aldige's neck he shouted, "One, two, w'l three?flo!" and at the last word the of executioner turned the screw. The murders for which the men were executed were discovered by accident. A on wealthy man named Rojano, who was an a great gambler disappeared, and the th: police traced him to Aldige's house. A ?f careful examination was made of the premises and Just as the authorities bl< were about to leave, a freshly turned en up mcund of earth was noticed in the fo] garden. When excavations were made the body of Rojano was discovered be- m! s neath the surface. Further examina- to| tions were made and six others were fjn found. The victims had been killed by a single blow of the heavy hammer delivered from behind, thus crushing the skull. The garden in which the bodies tw were found was called "The Garden of m( Death." ?

YORKVILLE, S. C.t PUESDAY, DECEMBER 4. 190(5. A dispatch frdm New Orleans says at Lancaster spinners have arranged *? niirnhooo r\t ^ AOH Q OTPfi nf land Louisiana and 5,000 in Mississippi r the purpose of making experiments the direction of raising cotton to be ipped directly from the farms to the ills of the spinners. We are, glad to ar of this experiment. While we do >t doubt that the spinners can raise tton at present prices, we are quite ire that if there should be a return the conditions of a few years back ey will suddenly come to the conclu>n that they can buy cotton cheaper an they can raise It. A Washington correspondent writes at Senator Tillman has determined introduce a resolution providing for e Investigation of the Brownsville afir and the right of the president to scharge the negro troops without a urt martial. That the negroes were ititled to a court martial Is probably fact; but It is not understood that nator Tillman is especially concerned the technical rights of the negroes the matter. What he Is driving at is litical advantage. It is assumed that he introduces such a resolution, the ^publicans will necessarily have to ind by the president, and in doing they will to a greater or less extent trange the negroes from the Republln party. The Republicans have not en calculating on such a develop ent as Senator Tillman has in conmplatlon, they assuming very natury that southern Democrats generally >uld endorse the president's course in e whole matter. As to whether any od is to be accomplished by the resjtion suggested we are more than If doubtful. It might be worth someing to estrange the negroes from the ^publican party or the Republican rty from the negroes; but we have idea that such a thing can be acmplished in any such way. As the Ing now stands, many of the negroes ve soured on Roosevelt and that is out as good as will ever come of the itter. Even at that no one need be rprised if the president should sudnly do something to undo all that hns alrendy done in the matter. Death of Samuel Spencer. in the untimely and horrible death Samuel Spencer, the south, that rtion south of Baltimore and east of s Mississippi river, has met with a avy, very heavy loss, for it would idle to deny that during the past elve or fifteen years especially, Mr. encer has done more than any other e living man in promoting the instrial development and progress of is section. Of course, we would not be under>od as giving to Mr. Spencer credit * all that the south has accomplished ring the period mentioned. He is t entitled to credit for all; but that has done his part and a wonderful rt at that there is no reasonable ound for question. Except for his narkable ability, his wonderful enerand his determined purpose to the lgle end of trying to complete in e short life time the tremendous ins he had in mind, the progress of e south would be written in much orter space than is now required for i story. Including as it does thousands of les of tracks, millions of dollars of pital. and branching outward and ward with a restlessness, the mere utemplation of which almost makes e dizzy, the Southern is, in many jpects the most remarkable railway stem in the world, and all who are formed as to the history and growth this giant property, thoroughly unrstand that more than to uny other e man it owes its existence to the :e Samuel Spencer. In making this itement we do not forget Mr. J. P. 5rgan and others. The work could t have been accomplished without sir help; but it was Mr. Spencer who mmanded their confidence and ented their support and co-operation, ithout them he would have done ich less: without him they would ve done nothing. Their tremendous wurces and abilities would have and employment in other directions. We have not lost sight of the fact th the general public, or a large part ; mon-.o-amoni of thp Southern s built up a reputation that is synymous with hap-hazard recklessness d inefficiency. We do not forget at its history during the past ten or teen years is written largely in the >od and suffering of passengers and tployees. These things are not to be rgotten. But let us not hold the tnagement of the railway system algether responsible for this, lest we id ourselves accusing others where ourselves are also guilty. There have been and there are still o sides to this tremendous develop?nt of the Southern railroad and the uth. On the one hand it is the restts energy of the southern people mating a tremendous demand for insportation, and on the other hand e restless energy of the railroad peo; trying to supply that demand. The uth has been working at highly ertaxed pressure in building and mating commerce, and the railroad s been working at highly overtaxed essure in trying to meet the almost ipossible demands upon it. Mr. Spencer has been the responsible ad of the railroad side of the probn, and although it cannot be claimthat he has fully and completely it all the demands that h^ve been xde upon him, it does not require stretch of charity to say that what has accomplished is little short of irvelous. If there is another man tslde of those who have gotten their lining under and through Mr. Spenr. who can fill his place as he filled It. the name of that man Is not generally known, and It Is probably fair to say also that If Mr. Spencer failed to measure up to the fullest extent of his responsibility there are few others who would not have fallen far short of his achievements. As to what will be the effect of Mr. Spencer's death, especially In view of the peculiarly sad circumstances under which It occurred, we do not know. We are unequal to the problem. As we see It, the mighty rush of pressure under which the Southern railway has been laboring for several years must needs continue or else the south must be content with slower progress. The railroad facilities between the north and south are clearly inadequate, and the problems presented are of a nature that necessarily require time in their solution. Will the south wait until doubletracking is completed and thousands of additional cars and engines can be provided, or will it continue to demand that present facilities be worked to double and thribble capacity, until normal capacity is increased to a point commensurate with normal demand? We don't think there will be any , waiting. Just as it has been with hundreds of others before him and as we fear It will be with hundreds of others after him, the life of Samuel Spencer went out as a sacrifice to the mad avalanche of the southern progress. 

CONVENING OF CONGRESS. Last End of 59th Session Began Yesterday. The last half of the 59th congress was convened yesterday, and both the house and senate at once commenced to arrange preliminaries for work. The roll call of the house showed 300 members present and a number of new members were sworn in. After the auDointment of a committee to Inform the president that the house was ready to receive communications from the chief executive the body adjourned out of respect to deceased members. Shortly after the senate was called to order. Senator Penrose announced that he had a resolution to offer. Vice President Fairbanks called attention to the fact that It was not customary to transact miscellaneous business until after the reading' of the president's message. Senator Penrose then asked unanimous consent for the reading of his resolution. Unanimous consent was granted, and It developed that the resolution provided for the investigation of the president's action with reference to the negro troops, On motion the resolution was allowed to go over. Senator Foraker introduced a sim nar resolution 01 similar uupuii uircvied to the secretary of war. This was disposed of In a similar manner. There is reason to suppose that both of these resolutions were Introduced with a view to forstalllng a similar resolution that Senator Tillman had in contemplation. Further developments are expected. The president's message was not read yesterday, the understanding being that it would not be forthcoming until this afternoon. Senator Tillman is quoted by the < Washington correspondent of the Columbia State that he has never had the I slightest idea of Introducing such a resolution as is referred to above; but that he will have some remarks to 111:1 k?- 1 >11 tilt* subject of one of the resolutions. \ Mr. Spencer'3 Successor.?W. W. Fin ley of Washington, D. C., second vice president of the Southern and who Thursday succeeded in the actual management of the system upon the , death of President Spencer, it is stated, will be elected to succeed his late president. The fact that Mr. Flnley takes charge is indicative, it is declared, of the action to be taken by the board of directors of this system when they meet Ir. New York, later to elect a president and fill any created vacancy. First vice President Andrews, it is stated, feels that his advanced years would cause the duties of this great 1 office to be too much of a burden to 1 him to seek or accept the place. He ( will, in all probability, continue as first vice president and in charge of the legislative branch of this system. Mr. Finley has long lived in Washington, where he has been actively in , touch with the actual management of the road, and is in every way capable to succeed Mr. Spencer. < It is stated that Fairfax Harrison, , assistant to President Spencer, may be considered for this place on account of the intimate connection he held with the late president and the fact that he might be able to continue the lines marked out by President Spencer. It is generally conceded that the Southern system is owned by the great banking house of J. Pierpont Morgan , & Co., of Wall street. New York city, in whose office the election will be call ed at a later date. The list of directors for this great system, as listed in Poor's Manual follows : H. C. Fahnestock, New York city; W. W. Finley, Washington; Samuel Spencer, New York city; A. B. Andrews, Raleigh, N. C.; Joseph Bryan, Richmond: S. M. Inman, Atlanta; R. M. Gallaway, New York city; Adrian Iselin, New York city; E. D. Randolph, New York city, and J, T. Woodward, New York city. The list of officers prior to the death of Mr. Spencer, was as follows: Samuel Spencer, president; A. B. Andrews, first vice president; W. W. Finley, second vice president; J. M. Culp, i third vice president; C. H. Ackert, fourth vice president; T. C. Powell, fifth vice president, H. B. Spencer, sixth 1 vice president: Fairfax Harrison assistant to the president. i Constables Cannot Seize Liquor In Depot.?In deciding yesterday the case of Paul Heyman vs. the South- : ern Railway company, the supreme court of the United States dealt with the question of the extent to which a , railroad company becomes an Insur- 1 ance company to its freight patrons. Heyman is a wholesale liquor dealer in Augusta, Ga., and when some years ago he sold and shipped two consignments of whisky to purchasers in | Charleston, S. C., it was Immediately seized by the state authorities and de- ( stroyed in pursuance of the South Carolina dispensary law, while still in the warehouse in which It had been , placed by the railroad company. , Heyman was compelled to return the ( purchase price to the consignee and , then sought to recover from the railroad company on the ground that the company had insured the safe delivery of the goods. The Georgia sunreme court held that as the property had been seized under legal authority ' the company could not be held liable. The opinion of the Federal supreme court was delivered by Justice White and reversed the finding of the lower court. Casr of thk Nkgro Troops.?The war department Is preparing for an investigation by congress of the case of the companies of the Twenty-fifth infantry recently discharged without honor bv order of President Roosevelt, and to this end has compiled a record of negro troops dating back to the civil war. It is said that this record dls- 1 closes a state of affairs not generally known, and that once before at least the Twenty-fifth Infantry "shot up a < town." The affair happened in 1885 at Fort Sturgls, Dakota. Some of the ne- , gro soldiers went on a rampage simi- , lar to that at Brownsville, Tex., and \ one of their number killed a citizen. In that case, however, the citizens took the matter Into their own hands, fore- ! ed the troops under pain of death to ' disclose the name of the man who did 1 the killing and then took him out and lynched him.

I The editor of The Enquirer was 1 raited on yesterday by a committee 1 rom Unity Baptist church, the object 1 f the committee being to challenge * he correction of certain statements ' hat were made about the church in he recently published story of the i mrder of Mrs. Morgan by Tom Har- i Is. , oAmmUfoo OAnulatoH C\f Moflflrfl < f. W. Harris, T. J. Wright and J. It. Vright, all members of Unity church, nd the part of the Morgan murder tory to which they objected more eseclally was as follows: "Some two or three years ago, at a ;lnd of a revival meeting held at Unly church, about a mile from Hickory Irove, Harris took up the Idea that he ad been converted. Unity is a weak [ttle church and the congregation Is omposed mostly of a more or less liberate class from "Blue Water" and Sandy Branch." They claim to be iaptlats; but the church Is not recogIzed in the association as standing ery high. At any rate Harris began raying and exhorting and finally got he endorsement of his congregation s a preacher. Some time ago he was onvlcted of violation of a contract nd put on the chaingang." The statements most objectionable o the committee were (1) "That the ongregatlon is composed mostly of a lore or less illiterate class from 'Blue Vater' and 'Sandy Branch,'" and (2) hat the church Is "not recognized as landing very high In the association." 'hey say that the church Is as prosierous as it has ever been In its hlsory and its membership Includes as ood people as there Is In the neighorhood. The pastor is Rev. W. T. "hompson of Gaffney. While It Is a act that at one time a number of lembers professed sanctiflcation and racticed foot washing, this crowd as gone off, much to the satisfaction f the present membership. The committee says there are two members rom Sandy Branch; but they were nable to locate the "Blue Water" elghborhood. Their objections to hese designations were only In so far 8 the designation might be construed s terms of reproach, which they in1st that no one has a right to put upn any part of the congregation. HarIs, they say, did have a license to reach at Unity at one time; but he ras turned out of the church for r ,'lfe beating and his license was takn away. They all Insist, and very roperly too, that Unity church Is in o wise responsible for Harris. The attitude of the committee In a equestlng these explanations was i ourteous and liberal, and we are glad 1 o do anything we can to place the f latter In a proper light. The com- c llttee was advised that if such state- 1 lents as we might make should not a rove satisfactory we would be pleas- a d to print any further statement that a light be sent in on behalf of the v hurch over the signature of the com- a iltteemen or other duly authorized c ommitteemen. t The committeemen seemed to be C nder the Impression that some of the o eople from whom we got our infor- J lation were inclined to put reproach tl pon the church. In this we are quite g are that the committee Is mistaken, tl 11 the information that was printed tl 'as developed as the result of ques- t( ons asked by our representatives, E nd none of it was volunteered. The > Inquirer certainly had no intention h f putting reproach on Unity congre- f> ation, and it is quite sure that no t< itch intention was entertained by the il eople from whom It got Its informa- a on. w

The Interment was In the Bethesda Presbyterian church yard, twelve miles from the city, In which church the deceased also served as an elder for some years, and In which neighborhood he was born and spent the greater part of his life. The Masonic fraternity of which Mr. Sadler was a loyal member took charge of the body after the religious services and conducted the Interment. Mr. Sadler was fifty-six years of age in September and spent the whole of his life 1n this county, living on and farming the plantation where his father and grandfather had lived until 1892, when he moved to this city to become a thember of the Roddey Mercantile company.

Mr. Barron was awake and had been for some time and heard the train behind coming. He supposed that 33 was on a siding, however, and thought nothing of'the train thundering down towards him until the crash came. He said that he saw no misconduct in the behavior of the porters, who were said to have looted a lady's valise, but on the other hand that the employees Were exceedingly attentive and took charge of and protected the baggage and personal effects. Mr. Barron has a souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a handsome sleeve button. He found a single shirt sleeve lying some dls, tarice from the car and this button was in the cuff.

CREIGHTON CA8E. Comprehensive Summary of Offense of Editor?Preacher. In a letter of Is-it Thursday, the Columbia forrespondent of the News and Courier gave a compreh nsive statement of the issues in what is known as the Creighton case. The statement is as follows: The charges made against Mr. C. W. Creighton are technically embraced in the term "immorality." The specific charge is lying and slander, but Mr. Creighton Is not yet convicted and even if he shall be adjudged guilty of the charges it will not be such a reflection on his moral character as the general public might infer from the use of the term "immorality." The case is based on certain articles appearing in the Christian Appeal, of which Mr. Creighton is the editor and publisher. The particular editorial on which the accusation rests was published in the issue of November 3, 1904. and is headed "Rings and Results." The editorial said: "For many years the existence of a ring in the South Carolina conference has been boldly asserted and the charge is believed by many to be true." The article then discusses what Is meant by a ring and states that such a charge could be proved either by direct testimony or circumstantial evidence. The editorial continues as follows: "We shall consider in their order circumstances that show conclusively concert of action for definite purposes, if not existence of a combination in the conference. "One set of men organize the conference, select the members of all committees and so distribute themselves In the organization that they are able to Jteep themselves fully Informed of everything that takes place, inspire action, shape movements, control measures, and bring to bear active influence to promote or defeat any and every action as they may approve or disapprove. The organization of the conference represents them, and they are represented In their organization. They continue in office and when one of their number for any reason, is forcerkto retire they select his successor. They exercise the power of a selfperpetuating body and that in direct violation of the law of the church to which they belong. "Second. They shelve the men who for any reason do not sympathize with ind approve their methods and pronote those who stand by them and support each other In doing it." The rest of the editorial gives other specifications, five in all, but the two juoted above are those upon which the recusation of lying and slander is based. One of Mr. Creighton's con:entions is that the method of securing the presiding elders' salaries is unfair md wrong. In his editorial already juuieu nc "Third. They agree upon a method )f forcing up their salaries In violation )f the law of the church." It has not tjeen the custom to pay the ^residing elders fixed salaries. Each jresldlng elder receives 15 per cent of he t tal amount raised by the churches n his district for salaries of pastors. Under this plan, when a church raises he salary of Its pastor It raises the lalary of the presiding elder also. At the last session of the conference i resolution was passed recommending hat the district stewards fix the salaries of presiding elders at stated sums md abandon the percentage r'an. But he resolution of conference does not lave the force of law and the boards of < district stewards are not bound thereby. The influence of presiding elders in the district boards is very strong, and unless they advocate the proposed change it is claimed that the change is not likely to be put into effect. There are twelve districts in this conference and each one of the presiding elders is a man of strong personality and Influence. When the committee was appointed to investigate the charges at the last session of the conference at Spartanburg, Mr. Creighton was suspended from the conference pending the determination of the case. He has, however, continued to edit and publish his paper, the Christian Appeal, at Greenwood, and it is said the paper has now about 3,000 subscribers. The paper has been in existence for three years. At the top of the editorial column is this sentiment: "Our platform: Closer fellowship between the pastorate and the presiding elders." "Deeper spiritual life on the part of the Church." "Lay representation in the Bishop's Cabinet." Before entering the ministry Mr. Creighton had practiced law for eight years and he is a man of excellent address and prepossessing appearance. He married Miss Cauthen, whose family have been prominent in the South Carolina conference, and two of whose brothers are now In the conference. Mr. Creighton consistently declines to discuss the case while It Is pending. 80UTH 

CAROLINA NEW8. ? Mr. J. R Culp has been recommended by the Chester delegation to succeed J. B. Westbrook as probate judge. Mr. Culp having been nominated in the primary this summer for the term beginning In January. ? Col. Leroy F. Youmans, attorney general of South Carolina, died at his home In Colurhbia yesterday of liver trouble. His illness was long and tedious. He was seventy years of age. Colonel Youmans was attorney general . of the state under Hampton, succeeding Gen. James Conner In 1877. Cleveland appointed him district attorney for South Carolina In 1886. He -was assistant attorney general under U. X. Gunter in 1805, and on the death of Gen. Gunter was appointed attorney general. He w^s a candidate last summer for election to succeed himself; but was defeated by Fraser Lyon. It Is thought that Mr. Lyon may at once be appointed to the office of at torney general as successor to Colonel You mans. ? Walterboro special of November SO, to News and Courier: Sentence of death was passed upon R. A. Adams by Judge Purdy at the opening of court this morning. . The day fixed for bis execution is Friday, January 4, 1107, between the hours of 10 o'clock in the forenoon and 2 In the afternoon. Adams was brought to Walterboro Wednesday night from Columbia, where he had been confined in the penitentiary sinoe his recapture about a year ago. He was placed in the dock at the opening of court this morning. He seemed composed and not at all nervous. When asked If he had anything to say why the sentence of the court should not now be passed upon him, he answered In a clear voice, "Nothing at alL" After the sentence was passed he was taken back to his cell in the jail, where he was later seen by the correspondent w uie now* ana courier. iuunu talked freely of his case and said tnat he was prepared for the worst He hates, he says, to leave his wife and Ave children, as the expenses of his trial have taken all they had. Only one of the children is able to work. This is not the first time Adams has been under the death sentence. The crime for which he has been sentenced to die was committed February 11, 1903. On that day he killed his kinsman, Henry Jacques. Jacques had shot Adams some weeks earlier, wounding him with bird shot but not Injuring him seriously. Adams was convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged the first Friday in June, 1903. Judge Ernetn Gary presided at the trial The ca>;e was appealed to the supreme court and In the meanwhile Adams broke jail Following his subsequent recapture strenuous efforts were made to secure for him a new trial The last of these motions was refused by the supreme court sitting en banc, on September 28 last. ? Discussing his alleged violation of the Federal Immigration laws, about which much stir has been raised by Gompere and other antl-lmmigratlon leaders, Col. E. J. Watson, the state commissioner of immigration, talked freely and frankly to Mr. J. E. Norment during the course of an Interview for the Manufacturers' Record, saying, among other things: "Congress must be asked to make such changes In existing laws as will give the several state departments of immigration greater powers with the sanction of foreign governments to conduct selective and restrictive work at ports of departure. We have worked on these lines, anticipating almost such steps being taken, and the character of the shipload of people landed at Charleston, I think, demonstrates the soundness of the proposition. No precaution that human foresight could Indicate has been neglected. All our representatives abroad have been duly commissioned, after being carefully selected for their fitness. The state department at Washington has been notified of each appointment, with the request to have each government to which the appointee was accredited duly notified through the American legations. The co-operation and sanction of each foreign government has been requested, and the request in many Instances most gladly granted. In several countries was this not only granted, but the advice was graciously given: 'Take our best people; leave th? h?H for ns to handle' and in one country at least the government authorities aided in the selection. When I went to Europe I did so with proper papers from the state department. Strictest instructions were given to all agents as to selection and as to refraining from misrepresentations of any character. Precautions were even taken to better the hours of labor and conditions of our own laboring people, and to protect their interests against , the introduction of foreign people. While abroad, and even before I went, I deemed wise to advance passage to desirable persons who could not secure sufficient money for the passage of all the members of their large families for the first few sailings. Vigorously, strenuously, I endeavored to get from the Federal government a construction of the law on this point, a state's powers being open to some question. Not a move in this direction was made until from the state department at Washington came a cable message signed 'Adee' construing the law to the effect, in plain English, that advance passage by the state was not in conflict with the alien contract labor law, but that the alien must affirmatively show that he would not become a public charge. I had accepted contributions to the funds of the department In strict accord with the state statute, an<^ with those proceeding under this construction of the law, a portion of the people for the first ship were book id. With all these strenuous efforts to throw every safeguard around the undertaking and to aid in the practical solution of a most vexatious national problem, to throw the cloak of the Federal government around an undertaking advocated by the strongest men in the country, as a state official of one of the states of the American union, I proceeded. I feel sure that the thinking men, the sociologists, those who have the betterment of American Interests at heart cannot fall to see the benefits promised through such precautions to the condition of the entire country."
