Th I labor I gives rise to in j have their great The Tariff. The president does not desire anv change In the present tariff schedule except where such may be made In reciprocity treaties, and recommends the adoption of reciproc ity treaties and the general policy of reci procity as a means of opening the doors of foreign nations to our commerce, in which connection he says: "Every application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover the difference betw .. the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wageworker is a prime consid eration of our entire policy of economic legislation. "Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our Industrial well being at home the principle of reci procity must command our hearty port.

He urges the necessity for strict economy penditures, but that " needs forbid us to be niggardly in the mat ter of providing whatever Is actually nec essary to our well-being." \ . h In Aicrlcultural The president cites the forest legislation 0 f the past and the great good of forest preserves to the people, and ways they will inevitably be of still greater value. Con tinulng. he says: i "At present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the general land office, the mapping and description of their tim ber with the United States geological sur vey and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with the bureau of for estry, which Is also charged with the g« eral advance the United St tlons should be united in the bureau of forestry, to which they properly belorg. The present diffusion of responsibility is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that effective cooperation between the government and the men who utill resources of the reserves, without which the interests of both must suffer. The national Interstate Coi He points to defects in the interstate commerce law, and recommends amend ments to correct them, In which connection he says: "Those who complain of the management of the railways allege that established rates are not maintained, that bates and similar devices are habitually resorted to, that these preferences ually ln favor of the large shipper, that they drive out of business the smaller competitor, that while many rates any others gross preferences localities and commodities. Upon the oth er hand, the railways assert that the law by Its very terms tends to produce many of these Illegal practices by depriving car riers of that right of concerted action which they claim is necessary to estab lish and maintain nondiscriminating rates. "The act should be amended. The rail way Is a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to it that within Its Jurisdiction this Is should provide a speedy, Inexpensive and fffect've remedy to that end. At the same It must not be forgotten that railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment j)f legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the develop ment and operation of these commercial agencies." too excessive and that made affecting both lo and tl: tereats. nent of practical forestry ln ates. These various func the of of : I bo I scientific bureaus generally should bo put under the department of agriculture. The president should have by law the power . trarsfeiring lands for use as forest re to the department of agriculture. He already has such'power in theca lands needed by the departments and the navy." of of war I rrignf li Irrigation in connection with the waste a question to which the president gives considerable attention, d makes strong recommendations government assistance in reclaiming thq waste lands by assisting in their irriga tion and the control of ever that Is possible, and of this he says. "In the arid region it is easures production. The weste ould population greater th>an that cl our whol country to-day if the waters tin saved and used lor irriga tion. The forest and water problems a perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States. "In cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years vegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and deer uro coming back, and hundreds of specially from the immediate enjoy of to make the streams and rivers of the . arid region useful by engineering works I for water storage as to make useful the lands of the west rights wher ; id, rater, not h which half of the United St£ stain a to persons, neighborhood, come each the privilege of camping.

"The for and benefit of alone cannot, how regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storage works ossary to equalize the flow of strea to save the flood w aters.

Our people as a whole will profit, | for successful homemaking Is but another ; me for the upbuilding ot the nation." He counsels against attempting too much at the beginning, but advises, that we let a small plan teach the pos experience I sibllities of greater undertakings. He also cites the conditions under which the set tlers of the west homes attempting to build these arid lands, ami says: "The security and value of the, homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water, but the majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court decisions rendered in ordinary suits law. With a few creditable exceptions, the arid states have failed to provide for the certain ar.d just division of stream* in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws have made It possible to establish rights to water in excess of actual uses or ne cessitles, and many streams have already | passed into private ownership or a control I equivalent to ownership. "Whoever controls a stream practically controls the land it renders productive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition of such ownership, which has been per mitted to grow up In the arid regions, should give way to a more enlightened and larger recognition of the rights of the pub j .d disposal of the oub upon ■ .pion», at | lie In the control 11c water supplies. Laws founded conditions obtaining In humid' where water Is too abundant to justify hoarding It. have no proper application In a dry country. "In the arid s-tates the only right to water which should be recognized Is that of use. In Irrigation this right should attach to be inseparable Granting perpetual other than the land reclaimed therefrom, rights compensation lo the public is opf the objections which apply to giving; perpetual franchises to the public utili of the cities. A few of the western states have already recognized this ar.d have Incorporated in their constitutions •nershlp water •Ithout all •ay ■ the doctrine of perpetual state of water." The Col i Considerable attention is given the col onies, and especially the Philippines. This section of the message begins by citing the needs of Hawaii and Porto Rico, of which he says: "In Hawaii aim must be to develop the territory on the traditional Americ lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the Islands should be shaped with this end in view. The well being of the average homemaker must afford the opment of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our homestead system." Of Porto Rico he says the Island Is thriv never before, and Is being adminis tered efficiently and honestly. lie deems no legislation necessary except that con cerning the public lands of the Island. He calls attention to the fact that in Cuba the independent government of the island' will soon be In control, and in the same connection urges strongly the need of reciprocal trade relations with the new nation, upon which subject he says: "In the case of Cuba there are weighty reasons of morality and of national Inter est why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnest ly ask your attention to the wisdom, Indeed to the vital need, of providing for a sub stantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban Imports Into the United States. Cuba has In her constitution affirmed what we desired that she should stand In inter national matters in closer and more friend ly relations with us than with any other power, and we are bound by every consid eration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures In the Interest of her material well being." For the Philippines he recommends much in the way of legislation, but again coun sels caution that with too great haste. He says: "We hope to make our administration of the islands honorable to our nation by making It of the highest benefit to the Filipinos theniselv.... earnest of what we Intend to do we point to what we have done. Already a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained In the Philippines than ever before in their his tory." He says we do not desire to do for the Islanders "merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by even the best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people of the tropics—to make them fit for self-government after the fashion of the. really free nations." But the idea of the president is that we cannot leave the Islands at this time, of which he says: "To leave tbe Islands at this time would mean that they would fall Into a welter of murderous Anarchy. Such a desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity." But he believes sufficient progress has been made along the lines under which we have been working in the Islands to war rant us In passing new legislation, but In this connection he urges the need of tion. He believe* the time has come when the Industries of which the islands capable should be encouraged by granting franchises- for their development, and of this he says: "Nothing better can be done for the is lands than to introduce Industrial enter test of the healthy devel ing is go neither t far and as would benefit them so ! Nothing i throwing them open to industrial The connect' lschtef is proverbial, and the nvlty to do remunerative work Is preventives of war. Of * man will go into the Philippines unless It is to his interest to do so, and It Is immensely to the interest of the islands that he should go in. It is therefore necessary that the congress should pass laws by which the resources of the islands can be developed, so that : franchises (for limited terms of y I bo granted to companies doing business in I them and every encouragement be giv lie incoming of business men of prises. much development. ld'lei oppo one of the no bus In rery "Not to permit this Is to do a wrong to the Philippines The franchises must be granted and the business permitted only under regulations which will guarantee the Islands against any kind of improper ex Dloltation Hut the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed, and the capital willing to develop it must be given the opportunity The Held must be thrown open to individual enterprise, which has been the real factor in the development of erv region over which our flag has flown, It is urgert'y necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general transportation, mining banking currency, homesteads and the use and ownership of the lands and timber These laws will givo free play to industrlal enterprise, and the commercial development which will surely follow will afford to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire ala them." The construction of a Pacific cable is also urged, either that the government lay such a cable to connect Hawaii and the Philippines, or that an arrangement be* made by which the advantages ac cruing from a government cable may be secured to the government by contract with a private cable company. This he deems necessary for both commercial, political and military considerations. ia«h in in n (mini .. * ,, tv ,_ r»»*d r>r an lie calls attention to the need of an isthmian canal, and says. •Its n fA°" ? prlJ 5 means nrosoerltv* and feets upon our businessi proa \per ty. yet w i thav i e w t o the se c ff e c 1 J * 1 ° t would be to the ;last degree important for us 1 ™™ jA 1 wi m id 6 nerhana^be most beneficial effects ,5 rt m f 0 h s ! . marked upon the I acinc coast ana ine I Kulf and south Atlantic states it wouia also great y benefit other sections.

Just <S years have passed since 1 resident Monroe In j his annual message announced that the American continents are henceforth not ■ be considered as subjects for future colonization by any Europea other words, the Monroe doctrine is a declaration that there must be no terri torial aggrandizement by any non-Anieri at the expense of any Anicrl Amerlcan soil. It Is in no y nation In Still less is it Intended to to any aggression by e Doctrine. The Mo The president sets forth the objects of the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit in which It has been received by other | countries, and in connection with it says this nation has not the slightest desire to y territory nt the expense of neighbors, and cites our attl guarantee of our "this pow powe wise Intended as hostile t the old give c world power at the oxpem It is simply a step, and a long step, to ssuring the univc •orld by securing the possibility of per lanent peac Id. of y other. al peace of the this hemisphere." The Navy. The president urges the building of tho navy forming our International duties as a protection and safeguard for our lnt national rights. He urges that our place first-class power necessitates the building and maintenance of a navy In keeping with our place among the nations of the world, ar.d says: "So far from being in any way a provo cation to war, an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guarantee against war, the cheapest and most effective peace insurance. The cost of building and main tinued up a means of per as taining such a navy represents the very lightest premium for Insuring peace which this nation can possibly pay. ds both the He recommen of more ships and the officers and and says: "There should be work of completing construction ddition of more as absolutely necessary, cessati navy. So far in genuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great hammering guns beat out the mastery of It is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several addi tional battleships .and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion. F character I refer y In the craft whose the high the exact number and to the report of the cretary of the navy. But there is some thing we need even more than additional ships, and this Is additional officers and To provide battleships and cruis ers and then lay them up, with the ex pectation of leaving them unmanned til they ? needed In actual war, would orse than folly. It would be a crime against the nation. "To send any warship against a compe tent enemy unless those aboard it have been trained by ye ice, including incessant gunnery prac tice, would be to invite not hi of actual sea erely dis aster, but the bitterest shame and humil iation. F men and a thousand additional marines should be provided, and an increase in fitted by making a large addition to the classes at Annap olis. There Is one small matter which should be mentioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmean ing title of 'naval cadet' should be abol ished; the title of 'midshipman,' full of historic association, should be restored. have 17 battleships appropri ated for. of which nine are completed and have been commissioned for actual dee. The remaining eight will ady in from two to four years, but it will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the time they are com missioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons, and the weapons are useless save in who know how to fight thousand additional the officers should be "We lie best the hands of with them. must be trained and drilled ell-planned system progressive instruction, while the lting must be carried on with still greater vigor. Every effort must be made to exact the main function of the officer— the command of men. The leading grad uates of the naval academy should be as signed to the combatant branches, line and marines." The der a thorough and of the The Army. No Increase In. the regular army is deemed necessary at this time, but there B-evetwl changes In that branch of the government service which the prewid recommends to congress. Chief of these is the establishment of a staff department and of this he says: * "A general staff should be created. As t ! for the general staff and supply depart* its, they should be tilled by detail* n the line, the men so detailed return awhlie to their line duties. It is very unde sirable to have the senior grades of the army composed ol men who have come to till the positions by the mere tact of seniority. A system should be adopted by which there shall be an eliminati grade by grade of those who render the best strvic grade. Justice ing after .lit the xu xt of the ■ho are still in the army would seem to require th«at in the tlrements they be give privileges accorded to their comrades in the navy." Another recommendation which the pre» ldent makes In connection with the army Is for the reduction of the "paper work * of the service, known to the pubiic as "red tape." Of this he says: , , "Every effort should be made to bring the army to a constantly Increasing state of efficiency. When on actual service, no work save that directly in the line of such service should be required. The paper work in the army, as in the navy, should be greatly reduced. What is needed is proved power of command and capacity to work well In the field. Constant care Is necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and commissary d'epart ments." He also urges the enactment of lcgis latlon in connection with the militia and national guard forces of the nation that they may be better fitted for active serv Ice In time of war. and says: "Our militia law is obsolete and worth less. The organization and armament of the national guard of the several states, which proprlations by the congress, should be made identical with those provided for the regular forces. The obligations and duties of the guard in time of war should be carefully defined and a system %stab llshed by law under which tne method of procedure of raising volunteer force* should be prescribed in advance. It Is ut tfr ly impossible in the excitement and haste of jmp(MldinR war to do thls satls _ factorily if the arrangements have not been made long beforehand. Provision shou,J be made for utilizing in the first (volunteer organizations called out training of those citizens who have al ready had exi)er ience under arms, and especially for the selection in advance of the officers of any force which may be ra i sed; f or careful selection of the kind necessary is Impossible after the outbreak of war IIe pra,scs the veterans of the civil war. the war with Spain and those who have rendered the nation valiant service in the Indian uprisings of the west and in the Philippines, and counsels continued lib erality i n the nation's dealing with them. the civil w tier of by law the £•; treated as militia in the ap the The Civil Service. He recommends the enactment of legis lation that will place under the rulings of the merit system many classes of ployes not now governed by it. His rec ommendation for this is as follows; "I recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified j the District of Columbia enable the president thus to extend it. In my judgment all laws providing for the temporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision that they be selected under the civil service law." He also wishes the merit system to ob tain In the government service in ths colonies, and says; "Not an office should be filled in the *gard serv •Ice to will at least Philippines or Porto Rico with any to the Ices, v an's partisan affiliations fith any regard to the political, clal or personal influence which he may have at his command. In short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing save the man's own character and capacity and the needs of the service. "The administration of these Islands should be as wholly free from the picton of partisan politics as the admin istration of the army and navy. All that we ask from the public servant in tho Philippines or Porto Rico is that he fleet honor on his country by the way in which he makes that country's rulo a benefit to the peoples who have come der it. This is all that we should ask, and we cannot afford to be content with less." Other Ileco lendafli Among other recommendations which the preside, makes are those asking for leg islation' nat will improve the consular ice along lines outlined in bills Introduced at previous sessions, and he s-uys that: "It is true that the service is now in the main efficient, but a standard of excellence cannot be permanently maintained until the principles set forth in the bills here tofore submitted to the congress subject are enacted Jnto law." the time has arrived when the Indian should cease to be treated Individual, and recommends breaking up the tribal funds, putting a stop to the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease their allot ments and stopping the ration system. He recommends also the establishment of an industrial educational system, and deavor to encoura this He believ i ^ a inber of a tribe, but en become ttie raisers rather than agriculturists where their lands are unsuited to tm? latter. He recommends liberal appropriations for tho Louisiana Purchaf the Indians exposition and an appropriation oovering expenses incurred by the Charleston exposition in removing government exhibits from the Buffalo ex position to that at Charleston. Another of his recommendations Is for a permanent census bureau, as it would in sure better, cheaper and more satisfactory work in the interest of business, statistics, economic and social science. The Postal Service. He calls attention to the growth of the postal system and to the fact that the nual deficit In this department of tho gov ernment service has been reduced to tho small sum of J3.923.727. This, he says, could further be increased and possibly a surplus shown but for the fact that many publi cations are now securing tho pound rata as second-class mail matter which are not entitled to the same under the law. Of this he says: "The full measure of postal progress which might be realized lias long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the government through the intrenched and well-under stood abuses which have g nectlon with second-class mall matter. The extent of this burden appears when It Is stated that, while the second-class mat ter makes nearly three-fifth* of th® weight of all the mail, It paid for the last fiscal year only 14,294,145 of the agAregate postal revenue of $111,631,193. If the pound of postage, which produces th»s large los* thus entailed and which was fixed by the congress with the purpose of encouraging the dissemination of public Information, were limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law, no just exception could be taken. That expense would be the recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy de liberately adopted for a Justifiable end. But much of the matter which enjoys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the Intent of the law and has secursd admis sion only through an evasion of its re quirements or through lax construction. The proportion of such wrongly Included matter Is estimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whole volume of second elasu mall. If It be only one-third quarter, the apparent. The post office department ha9 undertaken to remove tne abuses so far as possible by a stricter application of the law, and it should be sustained in Its effort." In con rate one agnitude of the burden Is The Chinese Difficulties. He calls attention to the satisfactory settlement of the Chinese difficulties of last year, and this nation's part In the settlement, and says provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the fofelgn representatives. Of the promises made by China he says: "The Chinese government has agreed to participate financially In the work of bet tering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tientsin, the centers of foreign trade in central and northern China, and an international conservancy board, which the Chinese government ts largely represented, has been provided for the improvement of the Shanghai rl the control of Its line of commercial advantages a of the present tariff on Imports has been assented to for the purpose of substitut ing specific for ad valorem duties, and h*.« pert has b of the United States to assist In thia work. A list of articles to remain free of duty, Including flour, cereals and rice, old and sliver coin and bullion, has also ean agreed upon In the settlement " conclusion, he mentions the Pan . r in session at the City of Mexico, and refers to the death of Queen Victoria and the dowager empress of Germany, which aroused the genuino sympathy of the people of this country, which sympathy was fully reciprocated by the people of both these nations upon the assassination of President McKJuie,--.
