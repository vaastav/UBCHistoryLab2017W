A HOUnKEOTB'S TBOCBLS. I One day m I wandered I beard a complaining, 4 And taw a poor woman, the picture of gloom. SUe glared at;the mud on the door-step ('twas ■ raining) ! And this was her wall aa ihe wielded the broom: "Oh I life U a toll and loye li a trouble, ] And beauty will fade and rlchee will flee, | And pleaaurea they dwindle and price* they double, i And nothing li what I eould wish it to be. "There'i too much of worrlment goes to a bon net, There'i too muoh of Ironing goei to a ihlrt, There'i nothing that payi for the time wasted on it. There'i nothing that lasts but trouble and dirt." "In March it is mud. it's iluih In December, And midsummer's breezes are laden with dust, In foil the leaves Utter, in muggy September. The wall-paper rots and the flat-irons rust." "There are worms In the cherries, and slugs In the roses, Andanti in the ingar, and mice in the pies, The rubbish or spiders, no mortal mppoiei, And ravaging roaches and damaging flies." "It'i sweeping at six, and dusting at seven, It's victuals at eight and dishes at nine, It's potting and panning from ten to eleven, Te scarce break our fast ere we plan how .to dine." fWlth grease, and with Utter from to outside center, Forevev at war anil forever alert, No rest for n day lent the enemy enter, I spend my whole time !n a struggle wltli dirt." "Last night in my dreams X was stationed for ever On a bare little Isle iu thu miu«t of the sea, ,; oue chance of life wat- a ceaseless endeavor To srreep off ilie wavc-o, ort they swept over mo." "Alas! 'twas no dream—again I behold It, I yield, I am helpless dty frte to avert Sue rolled down > er sleeves, her apron she folded, Then laid down an i died, and was buried in dirt. The President's Message. The message of President Arthur wan delivered t<> Congress Us' Tuesday. It is very long and would fill »bou; 11 col umns of this naper. I is* s<> long «i»t< we have not tbe -pace «» .iih. • full, and bat few would read it if we did, and therefore we publish the ab stract, with running commenty, given editorially by the Bichmond Dispatch as follows:— He then proceeds in few and well chosen words to speak of business mat ters, Buch as the isthmus canal; the ex hibitions at Melbourne and Sidney; an international copy-right law; the con dition and movements of the Indians. He gives the Yorktown Centennial a good notice, mentioning the German as well as tbe French visitors in fitting terms. The bi-metallic conference at Paris receives due notice. Also, the Electrical Exhibition and Congress in the same oity. It seems that our Government has had some correspondence with Germany about the natives of Alsace and Lorraine —the provinces wrested from the French a few years ago—but as "our views" seem to have been "accepted," there need be no fear of trouble with the Em peror William. It is in this connection that the President refers to the Von Steuben family. Spain still keeps on friendly terms with Uncle Sam. She will pay what she owes ns one of these days, notwith standing a little trouble about one of our vessels. The Czar was condoled with on the death of the late Czar, and he in turn condoled with the United States on the death of President Garfield. But these courtesies have not kept our Govern ment from trying to protect the Jews in Russia Especially have American Jews there been cared for. The President here refers to Italy. He says that America was represent ed at the congresses of Milan, Venice, and Turin- geographical, beneficentand hygienic. He asks all discriminating duties against colonial productions of Dutch East Indie? to i,e abolished. He says the American missionaries in Turkey must be protected, The Bwiss have selected American of ficials to act for them in countries where they have none of their own. The President protests against persons who are criminals being sent to this country a* immigrants home such have been sent back. He,says we have made treaties of commerce and naviga. tion with .Hervia and Roumania. The United States and Mexico main tain friendly relations. The latter is now open to railroads. Central America shows a pleasant outsifie. Our Government seems to have saved Mexico and Guatemala from a war. Costa itiea and Colombia have ar ranged fbr arbitrating their difficulties, and our Government is looking out to see that our interests are not overlooked by tbe arbitrators. The qu sfios, - growing out of the ca nal acro-s th> Isthmus-of Panama are receiving attention from our Govern ment Thf Pit- Kent's reference to Br»zi. ail! i>ui Irailc therewith reads as if there might be a subsidy behind it Here come iu several allusions to' South America countries We U"tf especially his reference to the war beiweeu Chili, Bolivia, and Peru. He is anxious for it to end, and has sent a special envov to all of them, with general instructions which may bring about a peace. But we are not prepared to believe that the continuance of the war would be "dan gerous to the interests of republican governmenton this continent,"or "cal culated to destroy the best elements of our peaceful civilization." Venezuela is complimented. The President has been looking after her in terests too. Ours seems to be a "pater nal government" in one sense at least. The President here turns to China and Japan. He refers to the new United States treaty with China, and makes ap propriate reference to the opium trade. He wishes to improve the consular courts in the whole East. He says Ja pan is the most advanced of the eastern nations. How will China like that? And the President, a Stalwart Radical and leader of the men who trample un der foot the Constitution of the United States, talks glibly about the intentions of Japan to establish "constitutional government." But the President means "constitutional" as in those countries where there is no written Constitution, and where the Legislature passes any lawß it chooses. King Italakaua comes in for a notice for himself and his country—Hawaii. All the European countries are next mentioned. Also, some of the South American. "Ecuador is likely to Dlay an important part among the nations of the Southern Pacific." What can it be ? The President recommends legislation to prevent collisions at sea. He alludes also to the Geneva convention. He wants the consular reports to continue to be published. So do we. They do not reach people enough, however. The President mentions the Atlanta Cotton Exposition; the International Sanitary Conference; the National Board of Health; the last has done good. He has some good remarks upon the general subject. The Treasury is in fine plight. Total receipts, $360,782,292 57. Total ordina ry expenses, $260,712,887.09. Surplus, 1100,069,404 98. The President recommends the early retirement of the silver certificates and the repeal of the law authorizing their issue. He says the national banks can famish paper currency enough. He recommends that hereafter only so much silver shall be coined as there is a currency demand for. Also, that the issue of gold certificates shall not for the present be resumed, and that na tional banks be required to give reaso- iable notice of their intention to retire heir circulation. Just here the President Introduce! Lome very interesting statistics The mnual interest on the public debt wat ast year reduced by 116,826,292.25. Unless the Windom bonds can be re minded below 8J per cent., he would leave them as they are—redeemable al my time. The President recommends economy ind says it is time to reduce the reve nues ; but alas he sees not Virglnia'i burthens. He would have all internal taxes abolished exoept those upon to bacoo and liqnors and the dealers it these. Six millions of dollars would then be collected in Virginia, and nom In all New England ? Was ever suet Injustice heard of before? He recom mends the abolition of the tax upoi bank capital and their deposits—but th< hanks must pay the cost of their notes. He thinks it possible thai soon the taj on liquors and tobacco may be reduced Le< ub have it ail taken off tobacco. Nc compromise. He recommends a com' mission to revise the tariff. He is verj cautious in bis utterances on this ques tion ot a tariff. The President wants the army in creased to 80,000 enlisted men. Rivers and harbors received little at tention ; fortifications and torpedoes more. The improvement of the Soutl Pass of the Mississippi river gets t word. The Navy Department next receives attention, The President is very ear nest and strong in hisrecommendatiom of large expenditures ior the navy. The Poet-Office Department is touch ed next. The President professes to desire t« see punished the Star-Rout® swindlers* But In Washington it seems to be un derstood that the wjole influence of tb< Stalwarts, if not of the Government, ii thrown in favor oi the accused. The President wishes the courts of tht United Stateß increased and the wholt judicial system reorganized The "Cow Boys" 01 Arizona come in for a blast it this connect)>o, The report of the Secretary of the In terior Is reviewed. The President re commends radical changes in the lawi as to li'diai'S. He is ritfht. The Mor< biobb are .denounced and their punish meut demanded The President m-orumends aid to the p .Dlic schools, especially in theSourh. am) for negroes, those States to havt m<wt money whicn have most illiterate pv rsons i' l O'-niiitisetoner of Agriculture if .1 .-e Alp" the Ci'iumtssoner ol Pensioi.a Ttie President advises Congress to im prove the Mississippi river He goes at lengtn into tbe question ol civil service reform, and discusses it candidlv. fairly, and intelligently. He recommends the same protection to navigation-interests as to manufac tures. He asks a Territorial Government for Alaska. The last paragraphs of the message aredevoted to questions connected with the presidential office, and suggested by the experience of 1876 and the illness ol Mr. Garfield. A Modern Primer. I Bee the Lamp-Post. By its Dim Bays you can behold the Electric Light across the Street. There is a Man Leaning against the Lamp-Post. Per haps the Lamp-Post would Fall if it Were not For the Man. At any Bate, the Man would Fall if it were not for the Lamp-Post. What is the Matter with the Man ? He appears Disquieted. He is Trying to Work his Boots up Through his Mouth. He will have a Headache to-morrow and Lay it to the Climate. II The Oirl is Scratching her Back against the Door. She has been eating Buckwheat Cakes. Her Beau thinks sbe is Delicate, but he has Never seen her Tackle a Plate of Hot Cakes on a Frosty Morning. Cakes bad better Boost High when she is Around. If we Were the Girl we would wear Sand Paper lining in the Dress and not be Making a Hair-Brush out of the Poor Door. 111 Here we Have a Baby. It is com posed of a Bald Head and a Pair of Lungs. One ,( the Lungs takes a Best whiie the Other runs the Shop. One of them is always On Deck all of the Time. The Baby is a Bigger man than his Mother. He likes to Walk around with his Father at Night. The Father does Most of the Walking and all of the Swearing Little Girls, you will Never Know what It is to Be a Father. IV The Peach is Hard and Green. He is Waiting for a Child to Come along and Cat him. When be gets into tbe Child's little Stomach he will Make things Hot for that Child. The Cbild Who eats the Peach will be an Angel before he Gets a chance to Eat another. If there were No green Peaches there would not be so many Children's Sizes of Gold Harps in Heaven. V Behold the Printer. He is Hunting for a Pickup of half a Line. He has Bren hunting for Two Hours. He could have Set tbe half Line in twenty Seconds, but it is a Matter of Principle with Him never to Bet what he Can pkfc U|i, The Printer has a Hard time. He haa to set ?ype ail night and Play Pedro for the Beer all Day. We would Like to Be a Printer were it not for the Night Work. ,VI This is the Man who has had a No tice in the Paper. How Proud he is. He is Stepping Higher than a Blind Horse. If he had Wings he would Fly. Next week the Paper will say the Man is a Measiey Old Fraud, and tbe Man will not Step so High. VII This sorry Spectacle is a Plumber. He is Bagged and Cold and Hungry. He is Very, very Poor. When you See Him Next Spring he Will be Very, very rich, wear Diamonds and Broad cloth. His wife Takes in Washing now but Sbe will be able to Move in the First Circles by the Time the Weather turns Warmer and the Pansies Bloom again.

Ralston, Elderton. Pa. Religion is good for nothing one day in the week, unless it is also good for all the seven days. A game of baseball is like a buck' wheat cake—a great deal depends on the batter. —STAUNTON BPKCTATOB A.ND GKN KBA-k ADVEBTIBEE.— Steady Hen! Let qb " possess our souls in patience," and all will be right sooner than we expect. "The bud may have a bitter taste ( But sweet will be the flower." Just to sure as history repeatß itself, just so sure as that "The mill* of the sods grind slowly But grind exceeding small," just bo sure as that he that malioiously or treacherously "dijtgeth a pit shall fall into the midst thereof,"just bo sure ly as "pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall," just so sure will Virginia right herself and her real people, the democracy, come back and "spew this new party out of their mouth." It has suddenly risen into unparalleled power, it is arrogant, vindictive, persecuting; it will make a clean sweep, we trust it may Its press in the rural districts indicate their approbation of the doctrine that to the victors belong the spoils to the fullest extent, and they are promising beforehand to cut ripe and green—make a clean sweep. Well, we can stand this. We have stood worse. The present democratic party stood war and almost famine for four years—and reconstruction with its insult and degradation four more. It has prospered under continued national ' defeat, against the corrupting influences of federal patronage, under unfriendly legislation, unconstitutional taxation and federal exactions, and until this 1 day its solidity became more solid. It required deception to make a breach. It required a corrupt coalition to stay the serried r«nks of intelligence and property. It required an alliance be ' tween what a majority of the whole . country calls the worst elements of both . parties to wrench victory from the grand party of Virginia that brought her up from the demoralization of war ' and the desolation of reconstruction un ' der military rule. Shall we surrender our organization, our principles or our flag? Never 1 Steady men, all along the line, and wait for the word. Boldly, honestly, openly, in Con * gress, in the Legislature, in your cities " and counties, in your courts and homes avow your principies and stick to your , party. You have a national status, al ' liance and name—you belong to the ' great constitutional, liberty loving ® Democratic party of the United States. Your friends and brothers—comrades are in every State and Territory, with f the banner and the same platform. Let us be*patient and prudent every where Make no alliances in the Le gislature. Vote only for your oWn f men. Let Republicans take care of I themselves, and the Read just erg can do so without your help. Ask nothing. Don't fret and do foolish things, nor make foolish threats or promises. They have succeeded on their explanation of the Riddleberger bill. Let them pass it. They have promised office to cor rupt Republicans—let them comply ? with their promises. They have pro mised to repeal punishment by stripes and increase criminal expentes—let them do it, and be responsible. They have voted to remove the capitation prerequisite—let them continue in that direction till they establish pauper suf frage. Let them do all they pledged themselves to do, from abolishing the i* whipping post to packing the Court of ° Appeals. Only let our representatives every where make a plain, bold Demo ' cratic record and wait. Meantime let our intelligent,property holding, Indus ' trious, energetic people—the true Dem * ocracy—turn their full strength to the development of the industries of the " State, to the increase of the trade and P commerce of the South, to the encour * agement of a home market for the purchase and sale ofall our productions. Invite good immigration, encourage direct trade and trust in courage, con ' science and Providence.—Lynohbu,rg > Advance. THE
