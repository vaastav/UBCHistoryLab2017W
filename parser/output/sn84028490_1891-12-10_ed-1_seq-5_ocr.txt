PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Head hi Congress It is a Long Tedious Pettifogging, Unin teresting Document. Littlo About Almost Everything, Doflnito on Nothing. Ho Endorses tho Tai ill Robbery and OnpaBJS Free Silver Coinage. Ho Entloroso Ilaum'B Ponsion Buronu. JloOtts Hot Under tho Collar ou tho illchiRan Electoral Law. Ho Fails to Mont ion Dlaino and Itooiprooity Onoo. Othor News of Interest from Every where. The President's Message Washington, Dec, 0. Special. Tho President's messago reported short, is n prolix document of 15,000 words. Tho following Is a complete summary of nil tho important points, lho President opens with n cIIscubsIoii ofTJunadlnn soal fishing, nnd recommends Congress to pro vide for a commission for a joint de marcation of tho frontier lino between Canada and the United States. Ho noxt taken up tho question of our meats for export, aud states that Germany, Denmark, Italy, Austria nnd Franco liavo now opened their ports to our duly in spected American hogs. Next ho dJseuAsen briefly tho revolution in Brazil, but offers Congress no ndvlro Noxt comes tho Mafia trouble in New Orleane, but offers nothing now. Upon tho civil wnr in Chili ho makes a long and tedious dlssi'rtatlon,closIng with advice for uon-lntcrforonco. Tho President next discusses the rebel lion in China, nnd says tho Chincso gov ernment refused to rect-Ivo Ex-Sonntor Blair ns United States Minister to that country, bee uiso Blair had voted to ex cludo tho Chlnuf o from tho United States. Hi recommends that certain Chlneso nrtlsane with their fabrics bo admitted freo to tho World's Fair. Noxt hu Htrongly endorses tho Nicnrau gua Caual projsct, by advising that tho United States government endorso tho bonds of tho company. Thuu he discusses tho tariff and its ef fect upon tho public revenues. Upon tho goneral effect of tho McKinley bill ho says: "It is not now my purpose to enter nt any iongtli into a discussion of tho effects of tho legislation to which I havo referred, but a brief examination of tho statistics of tho treasury, nnd a general gloncor.t tho atuto of business throughout tho country will, 1 think, satisfy any impar tial inquirer, that tho results liavo disap pointed tho ovil prophecies of its oppo nents, nnd in a largo measuro realized tho hopeful predictions of its frionds. Rarely, if ever before, in tho history of tho coun try, has there boon a timo when tho pro ceeds of ono day's labor, or tho product of ono farmed aoro, would purchnso so largo an amount of thoso things that en tor into tho living of tho masses of tho people. I believe that a full test will do velop tho fact that tho tariff of tho Fifty first Congress Is very favorable in Its nv orago effect upon tho prico of articles en tering Into common uso. During thotwolvo months from October 1, 1800, to September 30, 1801, tho total value of our foroign commercn (imports nnd exports combined) wns $1,747,800,10(5, which wob tho largest of nny year in tho history of tho United States. Tho largest in nuy previous year was in 1600, when our commerco amounted to 51,017,130,003 und tho Inst year exceeds this enormous nggregntebyovor ono hundred millions. It is interesting, and to some would bo surprising to know that during tho year ondlng September 30, 1801, our imports of merchandise amounted to $824,71G,370, which was an increase of moro than clov en tnilllondollars over tho valuo of tho imports of tho corresponding mouths of tho preceding year when tho Imports of merchandise wore unusually largo in an ticipation of tho tariff legislation then ponding. Tho avorago nnnual valuo of tho imports of merchandise for tho ton years from 1881 to 1800 wis 

?C02,1BC,G22, and during the year ondlng Sep tember 30, 1891, this nnnual average was exceeded by 5133,628,100. an Increaso of $02,014,021, which is nearly throo timos tho avorago annual lucreaso of exports of merchandlao during nny yoar in tho history of tho government. Tho lncroaso in tho valuo of exports of agricultural products, during tho year re ferred to over tho corresponding twelve months of tho prior year, was 515,810,107, whlio tho Increaso in tho vnluo of exports of manufactured products was $10,838,210. Thoro Is certainly nothing in tho con dition of trade, foreign or domestic: thoro ia certainly nothing in tho condition of our pooplo of nny class, to suggest that tho existing tariff nnd rovenuo legislation boars oppressively upon tho peoplo or re tards tho commorclal development of tho nation. It may bo argued ttiat our con dition would bo better if our tariff legis lation wero upon a freo trade basis; but It cannot bo denied that all tho conditions of prosperity and of genoral contontmont aro prt'sont In a largor dogreo than over before In our history, and that, too, when it was propliosled thoy would bo in tho worse state. Agitation forradlcalchanges In tariff and llnuucjal legislation cannot help, but may seriously iinpodo business to tho prosporlty of which somo tleureo of stability In legislation Is essontlal, I think thero am concluslvo evidences that tho now tariff hns created several grout Industries which will, within a few yours gi vo employment to soverul hundred thousand American worklngmen nnd women. In vlow of tho aomewhat over crowded condition of tho labor market of tho United States, every p.ttrlotlo citizen should rojolro at such n result. Tho report of tho Secretary of Tronsury shows that tho total receipts of tho gov ernment from all sources, for tho fiscal your ending Juno 8 1801, woro 5153,514, 283.03, whllothn oxpondlturosforthosanio period woro W21.304.470.10 leaving n sur plus of 537,230,702 67. s Tho rocolpts of tho fiscal yoal ending Juno 80. 1802, actual and ostlmntnd, aro $133,000,000 and tho expenditures $i 0,000, 000. For tho fiscal year ondlng Juno !, 1803, tho estimated reooiptsnro $155.3,20,350 ami the expenditures $441,300,003. Tho President noxt discusses tho silvor question In a halting, non-committal way, Uo does not fully ondorso tho prenout Re publican law, but ho opposes fr o silver coinage. Ho asks that tho prest nt law bo glvou fair trial, thensays: "I am still of tho opinion that tho froo coinagoof silvor under existing condi tions would disastrously effoct our busi ness interests at homo and abroa ' Tho President says tho not losa of gold during tho flscul year wob $08,000,000. Tho President next discusses tho U. S. Treasury and tho present fiscal policy of tho Administration, which appears to consist in withholding a portion of tho billion dollars appropriated by tho last Congress in order to savo tho Treasury from bankruptcy. Tho President next reviews at somo longth tho roports of tho Secretary of War, tho Secretary of Navy, tho Interior De partment, the Adjutant General's bureau and the now Agricultural Department. This is all dry and somewhat todlous de tails, In discussing tho Potofllco departmont tho Prosldontsays 8,000 miles of now pos tal sbrvlco has been established on rail roads during tho past yoar. Tho President says 21 new wnr ships all iron ond steel clad nro now In process of construction in our Navy yards and by prlvnto contracts. Tho President says 23,000,000 ncros of public lands havo been wrested from tho Indians during tho past year nnd addod to tho publio domain, but ho does not mon tlon any InndB that havo been wrested from tho gigantic railroad corporations. Tho following from tho mosaugo endors ing Genernl Rautn'nndmluistration of tho PetiRlon Buroati will bo of interest: "Tho administration of tho Ponsion Bureau lmsi been characterized by great diligence. Tho total number of pension ers upon tho roll on tho 30th day of June. 1801, was 070,100. There wore allowed during tlio fiscal year ending f v iat timo 260,600 cases. Of this numb"rl02 !87 wero allowed under tho law of Juno .'7, 1890. Tho iisulng of certificates has ' .-n pro ceeding at tho rato of about : 000 per month, about 75 por cent of tb -u being cases under tho now I" v. Tb' commis sioner expresses tho inlon ttiathowill bo nblo bo carefully djucat and nllow 350,000 claims till'" j tho icscnt lineal year. Tho appro, don for tho payment of pensions for tho l.tcnl year 1890 01 wus $127,085,703 80 and tho unx-itnt expended $118 630,010 25, leaving an unexpended surplus of $9,155,141,01." Tho estimate for pension e-xpoti ' turos for tho fiscal year ending Juliet 1803, Is $144,010,000, which, nf tor a careful oxamluation of tho subject, tho Commis sioner is of tho opinion will bo sufficient. Tho President rccomtnon ib no further pomion legislation, and doto not endorso tho servico pension bill naked for by tho G. A. R. Tho President says tho cunMts buronu is about complotn its work, nnd that tho coustts report will be encumbered with less essays than tho former one, and honco, will bo moro valuable. On tho Mormon question In Utah tho President thinks tlio laws of Congress havo operated to substantially suppress open polygamy among tho laticr day saints Tho President thon discusses with con siderable feeling tho late action of tho Michigan legislature- providing for tlio election of Presidential electors by con gressional districts. Ho recommends tho submission of a constitutional nmcnduipnt to prevent tho stntcs from adopting thin plan and providing for u uniform system of choosing olcclo-s. Tho President pettifogs this question nt considerable length, but as thin matter is loft by our constitution exclusively In Stato contiol, It veems btrungo that tho President should discuss it with so much elaboration and partisan spirit. Tho President closes his long stump speech to Congress with this touching per oration : My appeal Is nnd must cnntlnuo to b?, for a consultation that oliall "proceed with candor, calmness and p.ttlenco upon the lines of justice mid humanity, not of projudico nnd cruelty." To tho consideration of these very gravo questions I invito not only tho attention of Consresfi, but that of oil patriotic citi zens. Wo must not outerUlu tho delu sion that our t coplo havo ceased to re gard n freo ballot und equal reproianta tlon as tho price of their nllogiunco to laws and to civil magistrates. I havo been greatly rejoiced to notice that many evidences of tlio increased uni fication of our peoplo nnd of a revived national spirit. Tho viotn that now opens to us is wider and moro glorious than over beforo. Gratification and numzement struuglo for supremacy as wo contemplate tho populution, wealth und moral strongth of our country. A trust momentous in itt Influence upon our pooplo and upon tho world is for a brief timo committed to us, and wo must not bo falthlesH to Its first condition tho defonso of tho freo nnd equal Influence of tlio peoplo in thn choice of public officers in tho control of public affairs.
