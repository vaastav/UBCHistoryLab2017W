It is rumored in Washington Congressmen Mills will resign, his close friends deny the rumor. that but Pom Fkdro, ex-emperor of Brazil, who was deposed about two years ago after a reign of over fifty years, died one day last week at Paris. Our National legislators have now fairly settled down to the work of grinding out new laws and building political fences for 1892, particularly the latter. It is a pity all th idiots who point guns and pistols at people because they think they are not loaded can not be supplied with weapons which would fire backwards only. Gov. Buchanan favorsemploylng all the convict labor of the State in one mine. The plan would possess several advantages over the present system of scattering them all through the State, and is worthy of thought ful consideration. An extra session of the Texas Legislature will be called in March or April, which will elect a successor to Senator Jno. M.

A meeting of citizens held in the Commercial Club rooms at Nashville Monday night, following in the wake of Memphis, adopted resolutions urg ing the County Court of Pavidson County to appropriate not less than $20,000 for an exhibit at the World's Fair. The counties of Hamilton and Knox will also be similarly impor tuned. Pkesiacnt Harrison's message to Congress is not pleasant reading to the people of Chili, but seems rather to have strengthened the spirit of re sentment among them. It is report ed from Valparaiso that 'the Chilian government will neither apologize or ofTer indemnity to the United States, hut on the other hand that active preparations for war are being made. W.

DAIRY FARMING. The Debit and Credit Side of tha Ac countFigures from Practial Experience. Editor Standard I attended the Farmers' Institute at McMinnville, lust Monday, and the subject for con sideration, "What kind of stock will pity the best on the farm, and at same time restore the fertility of the soil?" was discussed at considerable length, tli' members finally agreeing none at all except enough to merely supply the necessities, viz: a pair of horses to do the work, it cow to lurnish milk and butter, and hogs enough to fur nish bacon and lard. I concluded if that was a fact that the farm lands of this county were forever rendered usciess, as I think it an impossibility to restore them to that fertility necessary to make farm ing pay by the use of commercial fer tilizers and at same time make the crops pay cost of fertilization and labor. I mean by farming the rais ing and selling crops oil the land. I will admit, though, the possibil ity ol the restoration 01 the sou ny proper tillage and commercial fertili zation, but I believe there is a stock, if kept and cared for properly, will restore it a great deal cheaper and faster. I will name her "the Daily Cow." Unlike the gentlemen at the Institute, I will not undertake to p 'ove this merely by assertions, but allow me and I will bring the figures t prove my assertions. What man in the county who calls himself a farmer who hasn't from o0 t ) 200 acres of and? If this land is rich, so much the better, but if it will not sprout peas get a machine (for the d dry cow is a machine for making it rich) and go to work on it. Some may laugh at me for calling her a machine, but she is a machine for making feed Into milk and butter the same as Mr. Waiting's mill is for making wheat Into flour. Now to the proof of my assertions. I say if your lands won't sprout peas you Jean buy feed and work it up at a profit, and to prove this will give ray expe rience. I have had a dairy of only 10 cows for 2 years, and while some of them are good ones, there are some very inferior ones among them. The gross earnings of these cows for 1890 were $50 and some cents each, and for 1891 to date $18.80 for butter alone. The sweet and sour milk as a feed for pigs and calves, in fact, any growing stock, is of no small impor tance, and the manure from each cow is equal to $10.00 worth of any fertil Izer that can be bought. JNow you ask what it costs to keep these cows ? With the aid of corn ensilage, that cost less than $2.00 per ton to raise and harvest,! feed them at 7 cents per day each in winter, which lasts about five months. The other seven months they do on pasture alone, although believe it pays to feed a little in sum mer. I give below the average earn ings and expenses per cow: CREDIT. Gross earning 1 year in Butter $48.80 Skimmed milk at 1 cent per gallon... 4.50 Manure 10.00 Total $03.30 DEBTIT. Cost of keeping 5 months at 7' cents per day $11 25 Cost of ensilage fed 5 months, extra 6 00 Pasture. 7 months, $1.00 per months 7.00 Total $24.25 Profit on one cow in 12 months $39.05 In the above I say nothing about the calf, as the skimmed milk was fed to it. which I counted at 1 cent per gallon, neither did I count any interest on investment or allow any thing for labor, as the more cows you keep the less the labor cost per cow Now this is an ordinary cow. A good dairy cow well cared for should make 300 pounds of butter per year which in butter alone will bring $75, and I expect in a short time to keep no cow that won't do that well. Now you ask, where will I find market for this butter? I get 25 cents per uound for all I can make 12 months In the year, from a grocer in Chattanooga, and he pays freight on butter and empty can back. The only trouble about finding market is to make a gilt-edge article and it will sell., It will astonish you when I tell you that the cost of but ter in any family in McMinnville more than the cost of flour. I wil not figure on this but let you examine for yourself and it will be more im pressive. The way to make gilt-edg butter requires no little study, ant the quickest way to learn is to get the experience of those long in the busi ness. This is done by reading the best dairy literature. 1 think I am a first class butter maker (with more yet to learn) as the sale of my butter testifies. 1 owe all I know about the business to some one else, and am willing to give others the benefit of1 my experience, which I will do at a more convenient time. Hoping what I have said will be a benefit to some one, I am, Yours Truly, F. (i. Smaktt. National Committee. Washington, Pec. 8. A meeting of the Executive Committee of the Na tional Democratic Committee was held at tlieArlingtonllotel today. The principal business done by the com mittee was fixini; of the time and place for holding the meeting of full National Democratic Committee which will determine the time and place for holding the National Dem ocratic Convention in 1892. It took the committee but a very few min utes to agree upon Jan. 21 next at 12 o'clock as the date and Washington as the place for the meeting of the full committe. The meetings will be held at the Arlington Hotel, where the recent meetings of the Republican committee were held. The New Speaker. Hon. Charles Frederick Crisp, of icorgia, happened to be born in Sheffield, England. His mother was there on a visit from America. The popular idea is that Mr. Crisp is thus barred from the Presidency by his fact, just as it was thought John S. Wise is on account of his birth in South America. But in both cases the men are children of American ) rents and citizens merely in a for eign country on a visit or on busi ness. If location has anything to do n preventing Judge Crisp becoming President, it is only his location in the South. Crisp is now 44 years old. His parents were well-known actors. Crisp got his education in the public schools in Savannah and Macon. Ie entered the Confederate army when 16, and became a Lieutenant in a Virginia Regiment. After three years' service he was sent to Fort Deleware, where he was kept till the end of the war. His parents were then living at Ellaville, Schley County, Ga. Crisp was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Ella ville for six years, and was then ap pointed Solicitor General of the Southwestern Judicial Circuit. In 1873 he located permanently in Amerlcus. Four years later he became Judge of the Superior Court, and five years afterward resigned to accept a nomination for Congress. He presided over the Georgia Pem ocratic State Convention in the en suing year, and entered the House of Representatives at the beginning of the session in 1883. Crisp is one of the most faithful and persistent workers in Congress. He is hardly ever absent from his seat. Grand Jury Arrested. San Antonio, Tex., Pec. 8. There was considerable excitement produced here today by the arrest of the Grand Jury. A capias was sworn out yesterday, and in re sponse to notices sent them by the Sheriff, the investigating body went to the court house at 9 o'clock this morning and gave themselves up, They were then taken to the county jail and placed in confinement. There is a fine of $50 hanging over each member, which was imposed by Judge King, of the Forty-fifth District Court, who held that they were in contempt in serving an at laenmeni on mm wnue tie was on the bench. The jurors bore their ar rest good naturedly, but at once proceeded to take steps looking to their release. An attorney acted in their behalf, and left here tonight for Tyler with a petition to the Su preme Court in session there for a writ of habeas corpus. A Lunatic and Dynamite. About noon last Friday an un known man entered the office of Rus sell Sage, one of New York's million aire brokers, and demanded from Mr. Sage the sum of $1,250,000, to be handed over immediately. His de mand was of course refused, when he exploded a dynamite bomb,which wrecked the whole interior of the building. Mr. Sage was right pain fully injured, but not seriously. The crank who exploded the bomb was blown to atoms. One of Mr. Sage's clerks was killed, two other's fatally injured, and several other person, in the building received injuries. Mr C. E. James, of Chattanooga, who was in Mr. Sage's private office at the time of the explosion, was consider ably shocked, and slightly bruised. The man gave his name as W. P. Wilson. He has not been positively identified as yet, but it is supposed that be was nn escaped lunatic. 

WASHINGTON. Washington, P. C. Decs, ikvh). The Speaker of the House, as be was escorted to the Speaker's chair after having been elected by the unani mous vote of the Democratic Repre sentatives today, was greeted by sal vo after salvo of applause from the floor ami from the galleries, and from the earnest manner in which he was applauded by every democrat ft the chamber, it was apparent that the long and hotly contested light in the caucus the longest for'many years had left no bad blood among the friends of the defeated candidates. Another noticeable and commend able thing is that the friends of the victorious candidate have shown no disposition to crow over the friends of those who were defeated. The democrats of the House are today a united and compact body, and there is every prospect of their remaining such, notwithstanding the herculean efforts of the republicans to create discord, and failing in that, to create the public impression that there is discord. The Speaker's desk was literally overed with flowers, sent by iidniir- ng friends a few minutes idler he ook his seat. The first business af ter the election of Speaker was the ( lection of the other House offi cers, i he retiring republican olli- ials were all given the eomplimen- try nomination of their party, although it is known that some of the republicans were opposed to so lonoring Mr Reed. Never was the circus which is al ways a part of the drawing by lot tery for seats in the House on the first day of a new Congress, more en- yed by the members and spectators than it was today, and ring-leaders n the fun were men whose nerves had been racked to their utmost ten sion during the long uncertain pe riod of the Speakership contest In the caucus. The gayety of the members today was therefore but the natural reaction of nature. The spectators in the galleries also took part in the sport. When the members were all huddled up in the open spaces be hind the seats and the blind-folded boy made his appearance to begin drawing the numbered marbles out of the box such remarks as : "You'll get pulled for running a lottery," "where's the cops," and "Wana- maker will be after you," might have been heard in all parts of the gal leries, and even upon the floor of the House. Never before were there so many new faces in a single Congress, and in consequence there has been an un usual run on the first edition of the Congressional Directory. Everybody wants to find out something about the unknown men. The occupations of the Representatives, as given in the Directory, show that the lawyers are still In the majority, there being 213 who are owners of legal "sheep skins." Farmers come next with 65, school teachers 42, merchants 24, manufacturers 20, bankers and capitalists 19, journalists 10, printers 9, physicians 5, sailors 3, clergymen 2, 1 miner, 1 machinist, 1 blacksmith, 1 bookbinder, 1 carpenter, 1 tanner, 1 car finisher and 1 harness maker. The total of occupations given is greater than the membership, but that is because some of the members have followed more than one occu pation. 9 of the members were born in Ireland, 3 in Germany, 3 in Cana da, 2 in Norway, 1 in Sweden, 1 it Greece, 1 in England, and 1 in Scot land. It would be difficult to get a more representative body together The fellow who thinks he knows what the House is going to do, is as numerous as usual, but the man who really knows what the House will do does not exist. It will take some little time for the members to confer and arrive at some conclusion Nothing will be done hastily, and nothing will be done before it has been approved with practical unani mity by the democratic members, Every member with whom your cor respondent has talked appears to fully realize that upon the action or nonaction of the House may depend the election of a democratic Presi dent next year. The Senate also has an influx of new members, there being 16 of of them, including the three Alliance Senators, Irby, Peffer and Kyle, the first of whom will vote with the democrats, the second with the re publicans, and the last as he happens to feel at the time, upon all political questions. Mr. Harrison announced today that, as the House would take con siderable time to organize, he would not send in his messnge until to morrow. There is reason for believ- ing that the change of programme was made not because of the organi zation of the House, but because of a change which Mr. Harrison was per suaded by Mr. Blaine to make in that portion of his message relating to foreign affairs. The deadlock in the democratic caucus from Saturday until Monday, gave many of the new members an entirely new view of Congressional politics. CONGRESSIONAL. The caucus of Pemocratic Congres men, last Monday night, nominated Hon. Chas. F. Crisp, of the Third Georgia District for Speakeer of the House.on the 30th ballot, till the can didates except Crisp and Mills hav ing withdrawn. On the final ballot Messrs McMillin, Patterson, Enloe, Snodgrass and Cox, of the Tennessee delegation voted for Mills, while Messrs Washington, Richardson and Pierce voted for Crisp. McMillii.'s nineteen supporters stood by him faithfully until he withdrew from the race. Both Houses nf Congress met at noon Monday, but no business was transM-ted further than calling the roll and swearing in new members In the Senate. On Tue.sdav the Speaker was for mally elected in tin House, together with the other caucus nominees, as follows: Clerk, Ex-Congressman Kerr of Pennsylvania ; Sergeant-at-Arnis, Ex-Congressman Yoder of Ohio; Doorkeeper, Kx-Congressnian Turner of New Yoik. Reed received the Republican nom ination for Speaker, and Watson ol Georgia was put forward by the Al liance members, the latter received 8 votes. The formal vote for Sneaker was as follows: Crisp 228, Reed 83, Watson 8. Several Congressmen did not vote. On Wednesday the President's bi ennial message was read in both houses, and ordered printed. After this the House adjourned until Satur day, with the understanding that further adjournment should then be had until Wednesday next. This re cess will give the Speaker time to make out his list of committees. A Heavy Assessment. Philadelphia, Dec. 9. The Comptroller of the Currency has lev ied an assessment of 100 per cent., aggregating $750,000, on the stock holders of the defunct Spring Garden National Bank. Cruisers Off for Chili.
