WIIKKLING, OfiCKMBBH 7, The I'rctlilciit'i ?lri?^> The first annual rnf.sK.ige of President McKlnley <o Congress will not be dl appointing to tho lnteillgence, tho patriotism, and <ho conservatism of tho country. The document, tho text of which appears this morning. Is notalblo for tho conciseness and direct method of expression which are characteristic of all Mr. McKlnley's public utterances, as well as for chat strength of Americanism and sound judgment which has drawn the people jo ' him In the past. In dialing with th? questions thai confront Congrwa for settLav;nt and the affairs of the government, the President combines the wisdom of statesmanship ( with the practical common sense and logic of t'he biwlne.sfjan.in. There is no involved or ambiguous luuguagc, no theoretical dlscin.?lon of economical or financial issues, but a plain presentation of policies and situations, with frank and courageous recommendations and submissions of views. fn the matter of currency reform, the v President reviews the history of our present system, and points out Ha defect.? and the necessity for the reforms which are proposed by the admin is trillion, recommanding for the consideration of Congress the plan proposed In the report of tin? secretary of the treasury, which has already been forecast and has been the subject of discussion in th? press for weeks. The plans for th?> gradual retirement of the greenbacks, th>) protection of the gold in the treasury, the stoppage of the "endless chain," the extension of the power of issue to the national banks, the encouragement of small banlcs in villages and agricultural districts, and the general provisions for a sounder ami safer currency system, removing dangers of panics and other disturbances, are all presented, and the reasons for the reforms plainly stated and urged upon Congress. This subject is elaborately discussed in the secretary .,f ,the treasury's report, tc which the Presii dent refers. Perhaps ibe most interesting feature.of the message., in view of the popular sen timent with regard to the Cuban question, is flic President's review of tho situation and the negotiations with Spain. This flrtfc <>piclal announcement of tho executive's policy, as it has been determined uron as a r.?sult of oiiieiiil information from Cuba and the recent diplomatic negotiations with Spain, will attract wid;?ttcislion. and will doubtless receive the hearty commendation or tho couYitry, aside from the radical Jingo element and the chronic critics of the administration. The President clearly shows that this government hao proceeded with discretion. and with strict regard for the integrity of the Nation and the International laws. American Interests, it is tfhown, have been eared for without Involving the country In warlike demonstrations, and throughout the discussion of the relations of Spain and Cuba and the conduct of the war there is no mincing of words in dealing with the brutal policy pursued by Spain toward the insurgents, up to the time when tho change of administration in Cuba inaugurated a more humane policy. The President fVt satisfied that tho reforms instituted by Spain, looking to giving th" Cubans autonomy, relieving them from the oppression against \vhleh they rebelled, and reversing the cruel policy of Weyler, will bring un end to the war. and the establishment of a Just and righteous regime in the lntere.it of human liberty. There in a warning that the United States will not tolerate any violation of faith on the part of Spain, and while this country will not pursue any ngpre*glvc policy which would be discreditable H will see to It that the Spanish pledget for reformm u rarrled out. The Prenldent quotes from the message of Pre.1lflMf't Grant during the ten years war in Cuba, j-howd that the conditions of the present Uprising have been practically the same, and adopts CJrant's policy with reference to the t|Uo*tlomi of liit 'ii'ereneo and annexation ;i i fitting t 1 ihh oivi lon, The cnnnervatlBm of MeKinley nnd the < >n?rrv<ithrn of the gre/it sol dler President, Ornnl, ni' th" same, un I will be endorr d by 'Ihe InMllgetice 04id 1 ()i? patriotism of the counlry, t It will be observed tlint Ihe President has not given up all hop.- that ft conference looking t?> an International ngreo* men! upon the silver ipieHtlon may yet be arranged, nnd that the arbitration treaty between Mnglnml and nw? tonititry Which failed of confirmation in tie sonata 1.1 ht winter, may again lid 'taken up nnd become an a > i,ni|)lish"d /Vit'l tTpofi nil other matter* oon-ernlng the public welfare nnd our r>*luHariM wlfh for Hgn government*, especially wlfh our Houth '"id Central AtnehOAU neighbor*, the President Id clear and explicit. Con- n corning the Hawaiian question, the civil 0 servce and other questions he is equally v lirm. Altogether vhe measuge is oue of the moat interesting and Important that d has been sent to Congress in recent years, and ita strength will strengthen the confidence of the country in the wise adminis tratlve ability of the present Chief Exevutive. v One of the nielli. A good sign of returned prosperity is t just now found In the experience of the treasury of the state of Pennsylvania. The Pittsburgh Dispatch's Harrlsburg 0 special announces that the state h&a (j been saved from bankruptcy by pros- t perity, which enables the corporations to ii [ ay years of back taxea and to uppiy for l> Increases of capital. It is shown that ? $1,000,000 in such buck taxes has been collected, and, in regard to the Increase " in capital stocks of corporations, the fol- j' lowing comparison with November of j; last year Is given: v During November, 18%,when the coun- K try was still In the throes of the distress >' caused by the Cleveland administration " and the agitation of the silver question, v Vhe corporations of Pennsylvania tiled In 11 the office of the secretary of the common- 11 weal til certificate# of increase of capital b tfttnik and indebtedness aggregating the } small sum of $724, ooo. During November just closed, these ! corporations, having felt the stimulus of J returning confidence and brisk business, In order to meet the demands made upon . them for .1 larger output, increased their capital stock and indebtedness by the magnificent sum of $16,1'(H?,000, an in- jj crease over November, 1896, of nearly a 2,Cl'O per cent. These figures neeti no v comment to bring their full meaning to tl thoughtful observers of the trend of pub- L Ho afflars c Pennsylvania Is not" the only state thai a is having rhis experience. From other v states come similar reports of these liuli- B cations of industrial revival, and every t review of trade shows a continuance of 1 the general revival In all linen with fre- a quent reports of increase In wages. On the other hand, the calamity wall, which 1: was abroad in the land only a short time " since, and which was being Industrious- < ly worked tyy political pessimists who t wouldn't work at anything else, has " fallen into Inoccuous desuetude, while s the pessimist who worked the bellows t that produced the wind to inflate the J1 wail has settled down, let us hope, to t earn an honest living and partlko of his p share of the prosperity. Even the chief " of them all. Mr. Bryan, has retired from t the country In the effort to cxtract some h consolation from the conditions In sliver r Mexico. j ? , A Silver Siij{|jfi(loii, II Here is a suggestive thought for our " free silver friends who are persuading Jj themselves that free silver and Bryan are still marching on to glory and undy Ins: fiftne: A careful analysis and comparison "f the results of the November ^ elections in all the states voting, shows j that In every one of the seven at a tea in which silver and the Chicago platform * wero made the issues the Democratic , loss in votes over the election of 1896 was larger than in any year following a presidential election in long numberof years. In the three states in which free silver was rejected and the old doctrines and S rccord of the Democratic party made the Issue (New York, New Jersey and Mary- <land), the loss In votes over 1806 was less s than In preceding years, while In wo me a Htatcs the calculator llnds there was an actual gain over last year. ri In Nebraska, Mr.Bryan's state, which * w.u? one of those making silver the Issue, the loss over 1806 was 13,960, against a tl Democratic gain of IS,726 In the year f>illowing the presidential election of 1892. J In Kansas the loss was 1M per cent. These are the two most notable examples, the percentage of louses ranging from 13 to 1 24 per cent against from 6 to 21 per cent , in the year following the presidential year of 1892, except In thtrcase of iNe- ? hraska, which made a gain for the Dem- v ocrats In 1893. t These fact:; might not he so significant ' were it not true that in t'he states where the Democrats ignored the silver Issue c they sustained cither slight losses or gains.

In reply to the request of a repre^enative of the Mail and Express for his iews on the question of the railway ooling, President Chauncey M. Pepew, f the New York Central railroad, is luoted as saying that, in his opinion here can be no substantial prosperity = 11 this country until the railroads prosier, and he docs not see how the railoads can prosper if an interminable ate war Is to be waged between them C "The railroad business of the last six t nonths has been done on the basis of a n leinorallzi'd rate," continued Mr. De ew. "and while the increase in earn- n ngs have followed a tremendous har- n kill notice that it has been greatest In a [voss earnings rather than net. You li uust understand, too, that these earn- ii ilgs have followed a tremendous har- h est here and an equally great crop ? novenient Induced by the wheat de- i nands of Kurope upon us.

This is the situation t; k'hlch exists to a larsc extent to-day, t ml to which we are steadily drifting. c "Now," continued Mr. Depew, "proa- ti lerlty, If It means anything at all, leans the distribution or wealth among |> he many and over a large, territory. Ii "S ertalnly duos not mean the eoncuntralon of wealth and power In a few hands nd In a few large cities.
