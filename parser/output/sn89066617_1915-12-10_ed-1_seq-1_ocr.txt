XIV. AND THE CAPE COUNTY HERALD, CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI, DECEMBER 10, 1915. NUMBER 48. WJ SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS RANNEY DRAINAGE ORDER Denies Writ of Prohibition Asked Against Judge And County. This Kentucky Senator Is A Former Governor KNOCKS "EXCEEDING AUTHORITY" CHARGES No Opinion or Reasons Field By High Tribunal-Oliver Gets Telegram. Judge R. G. Iianney's action in enjoining the Little River Drainage District from cutting Cape County highways in the construction of their main diversion channel till the re sponsibility for the payment of $100, 000 for bridges is fixed, yesterday was upheld by the Missouri Supreme Court when a writ of prohibition asked against the Judge and Countv was de nied. The petition for the writ of prohibi tion was mad by the attorneys for the Little River Drainage District last Friday, when R. B. Oliver, Jr., went to Jefferson City to file the petition. .lr. Uhver yesterday morning re ceived a telegram from the clerk of the Supreme Court saying that the writ had been denied. According to the word that Mr. Oliver received, the court's decision in the matter was not accompanied by any written opinion nor were any reasons assigned by the court for the refusal of the writ. The county through special counsel, Judge Edward D. Hays, on November 17, last, filed a petition for an injunc tion against the drainage district re straining the latter from cutting the county reads in ditrging the main di version channel, until the question of paying for the bridges made necessary by rea;-on of the cuts was settled. The drainage district's contention is that under the state laws, the county is supposed to pay for the bridges. It is estimated that in Cape county the cost will be about $100,000. Eight roads have to be cut by the diversion channel and three of these bridges will have to span a floodway of about 1000 feet. In the petition that Judge Hays pre sented to Judge Ranney, when he :isked for the injunction against the drainage district, he. argued that but a small portion of Cape County w ill be benefitted by the drainage scheme of which the di version channel is an im portant part. He argued that the drainage district should have to pay for the bridges made necessary through the creation of the artificial channel. The judge at that time issued a temporary injunction order restraining the contractors from cutting any more of Cape County's roads until the suit over the $100,000 bridge money was fought out. The injunction petition was set for a hearing in the February term of court. In setting forth the case, it was styled, "The State of Missouri at the relation of J. Henry Caruthers, Prose cuting Attorney for Cape Girardeau County" against the drainage concern. In the petition for a writ of prohi bition, the drainage district's attor neys argued that the party at interest in fact was not the State of Missouri, but rather the County instead and that therefore a bond should have been put up by the County before an injunction was issued by the Court of Common Please. The reply to that contention was that the county is a separate arm of the state and exercising government al powers which make it a part of the state and hence the bond was unneces sary. Accordingly it was argued the injunction was legal. The other main point in the petition for a writ of prohibition was that the drainage district is under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Butler County Circuit Court in which it was organized. Accordingly, it was stated, Judge Raneny had overstepped his le gal authority in granting the injunc tion asked against the district. Judge Ranney last Saturday said that jurisdiction of the Butler County Court obtained only in cases where the organization of the drainage district is attacked and that any court has juris diction in a case where a claim is filed against the district such as is the cae in the bridge money law suit.

Wilier, dean of Cape County's Justices of the Peace, vester- day afternoon declared he believed President Wilson made a mistake in arraigning, by indirection, the Ger mans in this country, charging them with disloyalty, in his message to Congress. He described it as an impolitic thing to do and a statement he believed to bo unwarranted. He said he thought that it was an unfair discrimination against the Germans that has been made. "Watch the Germans," he remarked, "and let the English and Allies do anything they want to! The English hold up our ships, violate all shipping rules and we don't say anything. "They take our ships going down to South American points and keep them from our commerce in violation of all rules of international law, and I don't hear anything said about it. ICs unfair! "Rut this that's going on right now is just like it was in the fifties. "In those days, when we had the 'Know Nothings,' a political party that had mushroom growth by night and disappeared in a short time after one or two elections, everyone had it in for the Germans and the Irish. "It was the same as now with the Germans everyone over here was against those two races. My father had to vote the Democratic ticket that year because there wasn't any other that he would have anything to do with on account of that feeling. "You see there's a lot of younger folks nowadays who don't know any thing about those things and if they did, it would make a lot of difference how they think about things that hap pen now. "We ought to have a man like Cleve land to handle the English. He sent an ambassador back to them and told them where to get off." Judge R. G. Ranney, of the Court of Common Pleas, one of the best known thinkers in this part of the state, last night declared that he believed the country faces a dangerous situation by reason of the fact that "too many people here have thought too much of matters pertaining to countries across the water." "I think if the people in this country would let those other countries alone and attend to our own business, we would be better off," the judge de clared. "This may be said to have been an encouragement for those who wanted to pry into our affairs in the interests of other nations." The passing of the "hat" so de pressed ami distracted the crowd of 400 men and women who heard the heroic Capt. Richmond Pearson Hob son deliver his oration on national prohibition last night that they forgot to cheer or applaud his remarks when he closed his address. The only time, in fact, that he did get a "hand" from his auditors was when the captain declared that after having lived for several years in Eu rope, sojourned in Africa, South America, Asia ami the islands of the seas, he would rather be just a plain everyday c.tizen of the U. S. A. than a k;ng in any other land. The man's good looks, winning ways and line personality won for him the osculatory compliments of scores of pretty women once upon a time, posed better than a Parisian manniquin as he rolled out the throaty sentence and the succinct sentiment. Auditors nay, spectators as well as aduitors is a truer way of describing those who witnessed and heard the former Congressman's remarks. In the course of his little talk, Hob- son quite out-Theodore-ed Teddy. There seemed, at times, to be no limit to his supply of "I's" and "me's." Hobson's address was delivered in the Centenary Methodist Church. He became as enthusiastic in his speech as any "peaee-at-any-price" advocate and announced that following the victory that is due to arrive soon for the cause of the Hobson Constitutional Amendment and nation-wide prohibi tion, that then it will be up to the United States to start the ball rolling for world-wide prohibition, modeled after the scheme of the famous Ala bama hero. None other than "Cap" Hobson. Hobson's secret for stopping the war is to stop anyone from selling the "Colonel" his "licker." Despite the fact that mankind seems to be able to raise pretty good corn and wheat and a lot more of it, and despite the fact that modern intellects have been able to figure out new com binations in the world of finance, en gineering, science, economy or politics that have had anything bested anyone ever heard of, Hobson stood up last night and proved to his own satisfac tion and by scientific deduction that the race is on the high road to the demnition bow-wows. National prohibition is coming, he assured his crowd of listeners and the trend of his argument was that it, will afford a panacea for all the ills of mankind. Perhaps then, the defeated will win; both political parties will hold all the offices; there will be no such things as "pie" squabbles and Hobson will find himself in the hall of fame. Allthat has to be done is to get both the National conventions "lined up," he said, indulge in a little insidious lobbying and "bring pressure to bear" upon Congress to get the amendment through q two thirds vote in both houses and then perform the simple trick of having the amendment rati fied by the legislatures of three fourths of the states in the Union. That's all. Hobson entertained his auditor-spectators with a graphic picture and re production of the part he played in the sinking of the Merrimac in the mouth of Santiago harbor when in process of "bottling" up the Spanish fleet. Even then Hobson wasn't a very good "bottler" for the Merrimac's hull was ripped to pieces and sunk before he had piloted it far enough into the mouth of the harbor. But anyway his story about how Mr. Hobson got his volunteer men to gether; how "I" watched them keenly as "I" impressed the danger of the mission upon them; how "I" ordered them to sit "tight" and not to "rock the boat" too soon; how "I held" them New York, Dec. S. Col. Theodore Roosevelt, in a H000 word statement flayed President Wilson for his message to Congress. The Colonel is pant ing for war. With is pencil he shouts: "What does Mr. Wilson mean when in one line he says that we have 'stood apart, studiously neutral' because 'it was our manifest duty to do so,' r.nd a couple of paragraphs later says that we demand security in prose cuting 'their self-chosen lines of national development for others?' "He can take either of the two positions; but he cannot take both. Did or did not Mr. Wilson demand security for Belgium to 'prosecute its self chosen lines of national development?' He knows he did not. Then what does he mean by saying that 'we demand this security also for others?"' (Contiaued on page six.) 

COMMISSION MAY SUPERVISE PARK BEN VINYARD WILL WED DECEMBER 20 Mayor Kage Says It May Necessary To Turn It Over To Board. Be The question of just how the city will operate the park is puzzling May or Kage. He is trying to determine whether he and the city council will select a care-taker for the fairgrounds park and supervise the improvements, or whether these duties will be left to a park commission. "It may be that the city will have to appoint a commission to take charge of the park, just as is the case in St. Louis and elsewhere," said the mayor to The Tribune yesterday. "Of course the city officials will serve as a back stop, so to speak, if a commission is chosen, but I am in clined to believe that a park board will be necessary. This body would be appointed by the mayor and ap proved by the city council. "As soon as the park is transferred to the city and the bonds are sold, I will take up the proposition of decid ing just how the city will operate it. If a park commission should be ap pointed, the members will serve with out salary." At the last meeting of the city coun cil, a letter from the Civic League, an organization of women, who have de voted considerable time in beautifying the city, asked the mayor to give the women representation on the board in the event that such a body should be created. In St. Louis a park commissioner is in charge of the city parks. He em ploys the workmen, such as landscape gardners, care-takers, etc. He also is Authorized to set aside certain space for outdoor sports, such as golf, ten nis, baseball, cricket, and kindred sports. Mayor Kage has expressed his will ingness to permit games at the fair grounds park, but he is especially in- Real Estate Man and Bride To Honeymoon Amid the Orange Bloss&ms. Hen Vinyard will become a benedict Monday, December 20. He informed The Tribune yesterday that he would depart for Parma on the 19th of the month, and the following day would be married to Miss Laura Gee, Normal graduate, and the pretty daughter of a wealthy merchant of that city. The wedding will take place at the home flfthe bride's parents, and im mediately following the ceremony the newlyweds will depart for Florida, where they will honeymoon amid the orange blossoms. Mr. Vinyard met his fiancee while she was a student at the Normal School last season. They mutually admired each other from that day on, and were seen together frequently while Miss Gee remained in the city. After the adjournment of school and she returned to her home in Parma, friends of Mr. Vinyard noticed that he disappeared from the city almost every Friday or Saturday and did not return until the following Monday. A quiet investigation was made by Graham Dempsey, who had been known as Mr. Vinyard's "side part ner," and he learned that his boon companion had an "attraction" in Par ma. His frequent visits to Parma caused a rumor to be circulated in that city that Miss Gee was soon to be married to Mr. Vinyard. Both denied it, but (Continued on page six.) tercsted in the creation of a small zoo, which would afford geenral amusement to everybody. As the park is comparatively small, golf could not be played there, but space could be set aside for public tennis courts. : i 1 tAv . km IS r N I t - v yffr -..-.-si ii t " -si&r !'
