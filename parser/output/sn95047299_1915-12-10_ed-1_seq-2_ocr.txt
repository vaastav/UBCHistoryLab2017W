FOLLOWING Is the message or President Wilson delivered t a joint session of the senate uud house at the beginning of the Sixty-fourth congress: Gentlemen of the Congress Since I Inst had the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union the war of nations on the other side of the sea. which had then only begun to disclose its portentous proportions, has extend ed its threatening and sinister scope until it h;fc swept within its tlauie some portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemi sphere, has altered the whole face of International affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called uhju to attempt before. The president tells how this couutrj practiced neutrality and declares that he hopes that when the time comes for readjustment and recuperation this country will lie of Infinite service, lte ferring to Central and South American problems, the president declares that we should retain unabated the spirit which has Inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put inlo words by President .Monroe. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mex ico by the course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. Rut we have at least proved that we will not take advan tage of her In her distress and under take to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Lib erty is often a fierce and intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set and to which no bounds of a few men's choosing ought ever to be set. Every American who has drunk at the time fountains of principle and tra dition must subscribe without reserva tion to the nigh doctrine of the Vir ginia bill of rights, which in the great days in which our government was set up was everywhere among us accept ed as the creed of free men. That doc trine Is, "That government Is or ought to be instituted for the common bene fit, protection and security of the peo ple, nation or community;" that "of all the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is capable of producing the greatest de gree of happiness and safety and Is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, and that when any government shall be found Inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of the community hath an Indubitable, inalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge Itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical but nec essary process. We will aid and be friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her, and our course with regard to her ought to he snlliclent proof to all Amer ica that we seek no political suzerainty or selllsh control Launches, Skiffs, '4 r : n..Mi i.

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT. Economic Adjustments Inevitable With in the Next Generation, The moral is that the states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but co-operating friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of interest, alike in matters political and in mat ters economic, is likely to give them a new significance us factors in interna tional affairs and in the political his tory of the world. It presents them as in a very deep und true sense a unit in world uffairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking to gether, quick with common sympathies and common ideals. Separated, they are subject to all the cross currents of the confused politics of a world of hos tile rivalries: united in spirit and pur pose, they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny. This Is pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire in it It Is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and independence and liberty and mutual service. The president calls attention to the meeting in Washington recently of representatives of the pan-American republics and says that economic ad justment is Inevitable in the next gen eration. No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we are appointed to speak can fail to per celve that their passion is for peace, their genius best displayed In the prac tice of the arts of peace. Great democ racies aie not belligerent They V not seek or desire war Their thought Is of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and the un censored thought that quickens it Conquest nud dominion are not In our reckoning or agreeable to our priucl pies. Hut just because we demand un molested development and the undis turbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression wi ourselves will not practice. We Insist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development We do more than that. We demand it also for others. We do not conline our enthusiasm for Individual liberty and free national development to the Inci dents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wher ever there Is a people that tries to walk In these I'.iilicult paths of Independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed it as Important that our ueigh bois should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be; have set America aside ns a whole for the uses of independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all out policies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a peo pie against aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta torial power within our own nation as of aggression from without We will nut maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary in times of peace ns In times of war. 

SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. Increase Standing Regular Force Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers. Iiut war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns It Is a thing of disciplined r.iiL-ht.

Greatest Danger to Country Comes From Within Our Bor ders. will not anow to airect mem, ropy muj properly use to serve them and make their independence secure, and not their owu Independence merely, but the rights also of those with whom they hare made common cause, should they also be put In jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role In the world, and particularly In this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle and by chastened am bition to play. It Is with these Ideals In mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense were conceived which will be laid before you. and which I urge you to sanction and put Into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized nnd discussed They seem to me the essential first steps, and they seem to me for the present sufficient They contemplate nn Increase of the standing force of the regular army from Us present strength of 5.023 offi cers and 102.0S5 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7,130 officers and 134.707 enlisted men. or 141.843 all told, all services, rank and file, by the addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers, ten regiments of Infantry, four regiments of field artillery nnd four aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re quired for a great variety of extra service, especially the all Important duty of training the citizen force of which I shall presently speak. 792 non commissioned officers for service In drill, recruiting and the like and the necessary quota of enlisted men for the quartermaster corps, the hospital corps, the ordnance department and other similar auxiliary services. These are the additions necessary to render the army adequate for its present du ties, duties which it has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts nnd borders and at our interior army posts, but also in the Philippines, in the Hawaiian Islands, at the isth mus and In Porto liieo. By way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale should occasion arise the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi zens, raised in increments of 133.000 a year throughout n period of three years. This It Is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of train ing for short periods throughout three years nnd to come to the colors at call tit any time throughout an additional "furlough" period of three years. This force of 400.000 men would be pro vided with personal uccouterments as fast ns enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would be assem bled for training nt stated Intervals at convenient places In association with suitable units of the regular army. Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. The president says It Is up to the patriotic young men of the country to respond to this call. 

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR GREATER NAVY. Always Looked to It as Our First and Chief Line of Defense. The program which will be laid be fore you by the secretary of the navy is similarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out hut It does make definite aud ex plicit a program which has heretofore been only implicit, held in the minds of the committees on naval affairs and disclosed In the debates of the two houses, but nowhere formulated or for mally adopted. It seems to me very clear that It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and ollieioncy nud to press that plan to completion within the next five years. We have always looked to the navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense; we have always seen It to be our manifest course of prudence to lie strong on the seas. Year by year we have been creating a navy which now ranks very high in deed anions the navies of the maritime RUN-DOWN WOMAN Made Strong By Our Vinol Fort Edward, N. Y.

NEWS, PALATKA, FLA. lUons. vro snouid now detlnneiy de termine how we shall complete what we have begun and how soon. The program to be laid before you contemplates the construction within five years of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one repair ship. It Is proposed that of this number we shall the first year provide for the construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines, twenty-five coast submarines, two gun boats and one hospital ship; the second year two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat and one fuel oil ship; the third, year two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet submarines nnd fifteen coast subma rines; the fourth year two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and the fifth year two battleships, one bat tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, one am munition ship and one repair ship. The secretary of the navy Is nsking also for the Immediate addition to the personnel of the navy of 7.500 sailors, 2,500 apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma rines. This Increase would be st;U dent to enre for the ships which are to be completed within the fiscal year 1017 nnd also for the number of men which must be put In training to man the ships which will be completed early In 1018. It Is also necessary that the number of midshipmen at the Na val academy at Annapolis should be Increased by nt least 300 In order that the force of officers should be more rapidly added to. nnd authority Is ask ed to appoint, for engineering duties only, approved graduates of engineer ing colleges, and for service In the avi ation corps a certain number of men taken from civil life. If this full program should be carried out we should have built or building In 1021. according to the estimates of sur vival and standards of classification 'nllowed by the general board of the department, an effective navy consist ing of 27 battleships of the first Hue. 0 battle cruisers, 25 battleships of the second line. 10 armored cruisers. 13 scout cruisers, 5 first class cruisers, 3 second class cruisers. 10 third class cruisers, 10S destroyers, 18 fleet sub marines, 157 const submarines, 0 uiou itors, 20 gunboats. 4 supply ships. 15 fuel ships. 4 transports, 3 tenders to torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special types and two ammunition ships. This would he a navy fitted to our needs and worthy of our traditions. But armies and instruments of war are only part of what has to be c n sidercd if we are to consider the su preme mailer of national self sufficien cy and security In all its aspects. There are oilier great matters which will he thrust upon our attention whether we will or not There Is, for exa tuple, a very pressing question of trade and shipping involved in this great problem of national adequacy. It is necessary for many weighty rea sons of national efficiency and devel opment that we should have a great merchant marine. The great merchant licet we once used to make us rich, that great body of sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag into every sea. uud who were the pride and often the bulwark of the nation, we have almost driven out of existence by Inexcusable neglect and indifference and by a hope lessly blind and provincial policy of so called economic protection. It is high time we repaired juur mistake and resumed our commercial independence on the seas. With a view to meeting these press ing necessities of our commerce and availing ourselves nt the earliest possi ble moment of the present unparalleled opportunity of linking the two Ameri cas together In bonds of mutual inter est and service, un opportunity which may never return again if we miss it now, proposals will be made to the present congress for the purchase or construction of ships to be owned and directed by the government similar to those made to the last congress, but modified In some essential particulars I recommend these proposals to you for your prompt acceptance with the more confidence because every month that has elapsed since the former pro posals were made has made the ne cessity for such action more and more manifestly Imperative. That need was then foreseen. It Is now acutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade Is waiting, but who can find no conveyance for their goods. I am not so much interested in the par ticulars of the program ns I am in taking immediate advantage of the great opportunity which awaits us If we will but act In this emergency, in tills matter, ns in all others, a spirit of common counsel should prevail, nnd out of It should come au early solu tlon of this pressing problem. 

SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY IN THE PHILIPPINES. Recommends Early Adoption of Meas ures Giving Them Fuller Justice. The president recommends the early adoption of bills for the alteration and reform of the government of the Phil Ipplues and for rendering fuller polit ical Justice to the people of Porto Itlco. which were submitted to the Sixty third congress. The president refers to the Increased cost of carrying out the plans for the armed forces of the nation and tells of the fiscal problems confronting the government On the 30th of June last there was an available bvtlange in the general rima or tne treasury or The total estimated receipts for year 1010. on the assumption that the emergencv revenue measure passed bj the last congress will not be extended bevond Its present limit the 31st o December. 1015. and that the prese duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar w ilt be discontinued after the 1st of Ma) 1010. will be $070,305,500. The balance of June last nnd these estimated rer enues come therefore to a grand tola of $774,535,005.78. The total estimated disbursements for the present fiscal year. Including twenty-five millions for the Panama canal, twelve millions for probable deficiency appropriations and $50,000 for miscellaneous debt redemp Hons, will be $753,801,000. and the bal mice in the general fund of the irens ury will be reduced to 

$20.U4.UU.S The emergencv revenue act if con. In ued beyond lis present time limitation would produce during the half year then remaining about forty-one mil Hons. The duty or 1 cent per pound on sugar if continued would produce during the two mouths of the fiscal year renminbi? after the 1st of May about fifteen millions. These two sums amounting together to fifty-six mil llons.-If added to the revenues of the second half of the fiscal year would yield the treasury at the end of the year an available balance of $70,011 G05.78. The additional revenues required to carry out the program of military aud naval preparation of which I have spoken would, as at present estimated be for the fiscal year 1017 $03,800,000 Those figures, taken with the fhrures for the present fiscal year which I have already given, disclose our finan cial problem for the year 1017 As suming that the taxes Imposed by the emergency revenue act and the tires ent duty on sugar nre to be dlscontin ued nnd that the balance at the close of the present fiscal year will be only $20,G44.005.7S. that the disbursements for the Panama canal will again be about $25,000,000 and that the nddl tlonal expenditures for the army nnd navy nre authorized by the congress, the deficit In the general fund of the treasurv on the 30th of June. 1017. will be nearly $235,000,000. To this sum at least $50,000,000 should he add ed to represent a safe working balance for'the treasurv nnd $12,000,000 to in clude the usual deficiency estimates lu 1017, nnd these additions would make a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If the present taxes should be continued throughout this year and the next, however, there would be n balance In the treasury of some 

S70.5OU.WO nt the end of the present fiscal year and a deficit nt the end of the next year of only some $50,000,000, or, reckoning In $02,000,000 for deficiency appropria tions nnd n safe treasury balance at the end of the year, a total deficit of some $112,000,000. The obvious moral of the figures is that It is a plain conn sel of prudence to continue all of the present taxes or their equivalents and confine ourselves to the problem of providing 

S112.W0.WW of new rereune rather than S2O7.0O0.O0O. How shall we obtain the new rev enue' We nre frequently reminded that there are many millions of bonds which the treasury is authorized under existing law to sell to reimburse the sums paid out of current reveling for the construction of the Panama canal, and it is true that bonds for the amount of $222,432,000 are now avail able for that purpose. Prior to 1013 $138,000,000 of these bonds had ac tually been sold to recoup the expendi tures nt the isthmus, and now cou stitu.e u considerable Item of the public- debt. Hut 1 for one do not believe that the people of this country approve of postponing the payment of their bills. Borrowing money is shortsight ed finance. It can he justified only when permanent things are to be ac complished which many generations will certainly benefit by and which It seema hardly fair that a single genera tion should pay for. The objects we are now imposing to spend money for cannot be so classified, except in the sense that everything wisely done may he said to be done in the interest of posterity, as well as lu our oz n.

The people of the country are entitled to know just what burdens of taxation they are to carry and to know from the outset now. The new bills should be paid by internal taxation. NATION'S SECRET FOES SHOULD BE CRUSHED. Gravest Danger to Country Comet From Within Our Own Borders, The president says that the precise reckonings of the problem to be met are set forth in the report of the secre tary of the treasury. I have spoken to yon today, gentle men, upon a single theme, the thor ough preparation of the nation to care for Its own security and to make sure of entire freedom to play the impar tial role In this hemisphere and In the world which we all believe to have been providentially assigned to it I have had In my mind no thought of any immediate or particular danger arising out of our relations with other nations. We are at peace with all the nations of the world, and there is rea son to hope that no question in con troversy between this and other gov ernments will lead to any serious breach of amicable relations, grave as some differences of attitude and policy have been und may yet turn out to be. I am sorry to say that the gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. There are citizens of the Xnlted States, I blush to admit, born under other flags, but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of Amer ica, who have poured the poison of dis loyalty Into the very arteries of our national life, who have sought to bring the authority nnd good name of our government into contempt to destroy our Industries wherever they thought It effective for their vindictive pur poses to strike nt them and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign In trigue. Their number Is not great as compared with the whole number of those sturdy hosts by which our na tion has been enriched In recent gen erations out of virile foreign stocks, but it is great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us and to have made It necessary that we should promptly make use of processes of law by which we may be purged of their corrupt distempers. America never witnessed anything like this before. It never dreamed It possible that men sworn into its owu citizenship, men drawn out of great free stocks such as supplied some of the best aud strongest elements of that little, hut how heroic, nntlon that iu a high day of old staked its very life to free Itself from every entanglement (. that had darkened the fortunes of tfle older nations nnd set up a new stand ard here that men of such origins ami: such free cboi.es of allegiance would ever turn In malign reaction against the government and people who had welcomed and uurtured them ami sec! to make this proud country once niore a bothed of European passion A lit tle while ago such a thing would have seemed incredible. Because It was In credible we made no preparation for It We would have been almost ashamed to prepare for It, ns if we were suspicious of ourselves, our own comrades nnd neighbors! But the ugly and Incredible thing has actually come about, and we nre without adequate federal laws to deal with It. I urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that In doing so I nra urging you to do nothing loss than save the honor and self respect of the nation. Such creatures of pns slon. disloyalty nnd anarchy must be crushed out They are not many, hut they are Infinitely malignant, and the hand of mr power should cloe over them nt onc.
