SIGNS OF STRIFE. DELUGE OP RESOLUTIONS 'IN THE SENATE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS. INTEREST IN THE MESSAGE. .. . ...... MARKED ATTENTION TO REFER ENCES TO BERING SEA, VEN EZUELA AND CUBA. THE SPIRIT OP MONROEISM. Senator Stewart Loses No Time in Introducing His Time-Worn Silver Bill. (President Cleveland's' Message Is printed in full on Pages 6 and 7 of to day's Globe.) 

WASHINGTON, Dec. The sen ate plunged into real business today. | Naturally the president's message at- j tracted the main attention of the day, but aside from this there were stir- | ring resolutions on the Monroe doc- j trine and the Cuban rebellion, and after that the usual deluge of bills ; and resolutions, running far up into j the hundreds. The message was giv- ; en the closest attention from all quar- i ters of the chamber. At its conclu- ! sion Mr. Lodge, of Massachusetts, i offered a resolution, vigorous in I terms, reaffirming the principles of ; the Monroe doctrine, and presenting them in such form as to permit their i enactment as a permanent law rather than an expression of the policy ad- j vocated by President Monroe. In the i same line was a resolution by Mr. I Cullom, of Illinois, and another by , Mr. Allen (Pop.), of Nebraska. The j Cuban situation received attention j from both the Florida senators. The j Call resolution will be called up to- j morrow, so that Cuba and the Mon- I : roe doctrine will receive early at -1 tention. At the brief executive ses- I sion the nominations of Mr. Olney, ! j as secretary of state, and Mr. Har- ' J mon, as attorney general, were con- | j firmed, and that of Rufus W. Peck- j ham to the supreme bench was re- ! ! ferred to the judiciary committee. I The senate galleries were again well j filled, but there was not the strug- i gie for place incident to the opening. i The floral offerings continued to come | in. Mr. Burrows' friends sent him a ; great cluster of yellow chrysanthe mums. THE 

MESSAGE ARRIVES. Formal proceedings over, Mr. Vilas and Mr. Allison, the committee ap ! pointed to wait on the president, I ! stepped together into the middle ! aisle, and Mr. Vilas addressed the presiding officer: "The president desires us to con vey his respectful salutations to the houses of congress, and to say that he will immediately communicate his j views in writing to congress." Then Mr. Pruden, the executive clerk, stepped forward and made the ! formal transfer of the expected mes- j I sage to the senate. Its reading was j listened to with marked attention, j There was noticeable interest upon j the Republican side in the reference to the Waller case. When the Bering sea claims were reached Mr. Mor gan, who had been conspicuous in op- I position to the claims, smiled at the I j announcement that a new treaty had been made and leaned forward for j an animated whispered conference with Mr. Gray. The treatment of the British- Venezuelan question also re ceived marked attention. The state ment of the status of the Cuban J conflict was especially interesting, as i I it gave the first official utterance on ] the subject. There was a thinning j out of the attendance on the floor j I after the first. half-hour of the read- j ing, as senators had printed copies. j At 1:40 the reading of the message j was completed, and on motion of Mr. Gorman it was laid on the table and ordered printed. _- ,_.. . Mr. Cullom (Rep., 111.) presented a communication from Evanston, 111., asking government action concern ing the deplorable condition of af fairs in Turkey. Mr. Gallinger (Rep., N. H.) .offered a similar communica tion from citizens of New Hamp shire. A resolution of the Idaho legislature urging the election of United States senators by popular vote was presented by Mr. Dubois (Rep., Idaho). Mr. Lodge (Rep., Mass.) was the first to secure recognition on the in troduction of bills and resolutions. He sent to the desk a resolution forc ibly approving, in the form of a joint resolution of congress, the principles of the Monroe doctrine. 

STEWART'S NIGHTMARE. There was a ripple of laughter as Mr. Stewart (Pop., New) reintro duced his time-honored bill for "the free and unlimited coinage of sil ver." ---•'.'• Mr. Call (Dem., Fla.) gave notice that he would call up his Cuban res olution tomorrow. '- '■''■ . '< Mr. Cullom (Rep., 111.) introduced a resolution on the Monroe doctrine similar to that presented by Mr. Lodge. He gave notice that he would call up the resolution as soon as per missible for the purpose of address ing the senate thereon. Among the large number of bills offered by Mr. Peffer (Pop., Kan.) were those limiting the president's term to six years without re-elec tion; repealing all laws permitting the issuance of bonds; the limita tion of the power of injunction." Mr. Allen (Pop., Neb.) offered a concurrent resolution for the imme diate recognition of the Cuban in surgents, the annexation of all islands proximate to the United States, the upholding of the Monroe" doctrine, and a firmer foreign policy respect ing the protection of American citi zens abroad. Mr, Allen wished • to. make a ten-minute speech on the. passage of the resolution, but it went over, with the others, without de bate. Mr. Squire (Rep., Wash.) intro duced a silver coinage bill, Which he stated gousht to be. a fair, solution ST. 

PAUL, MINN.: WEDNESDAY} MORNING, DECEMBER 4, 1895. of the present coinage problem. Mr. Morgan (Dem., Ala.) gave no tice that on next Monday he would address the senate on the British claims for Bering sea seizures. In this connection he offered a resolu tion for an investigation and report on the subject by the senate com mittee on foreign relations. At 2:50 p. m., on motion of Mr. Faulkner (Dem., W. Va.), the sen ate went into executive session, and' at 3 o'clock adjourned until tomor row. 

SHORT AND QUIET. House Heard the Message and Then Adjourned. WASHINGTON, Dec. The ses sion of the house today was very brief and was consumed entirely by the reading of the president's mes sage. It was listened to with fair attention, but the features of the document received no sign, either of approval or disapproval, from the members until the conclusion of the reading, when several Democrats created a slight demonstration. When it was finished the house immediate ly adjourned until Friday. NEW 

BILLS AND OLD BILLS. Hundreds of Them in the Senate and House. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.— There were 272 bills and 16 resolutions introduced in the senate today, but a large ma jority of the bills were reprints of measures which failed to pass last session. Many of these-, as also a large proportion of the new bills, were for private purposes. There were also several for the modification of the pension laws. Senator Pettigrew introduced a bill to establish a uniform system of bank ruptcy, and reintroduced his bill of last session to prevent the extermina tion of the fur-bearing animals of Alaska. Senator Vest reintroduced his bill of last session to prevent monopoly in the transportation of cattle to foreign countries, and also his bills for the compulsory education of Indian chil dren and the settlement of private land claims. Senator Chandler reintroduced his bill for the exclusion of alien anarch ists, and also his bill for the regulation of immigration. Senator Frye introduced a bill pro viding for the adjustment of the tariff laws so as to admit free of duty all material used in the construction or equipment of vessels built in the Lnit ed States. He also presented several other bills for the encouragement of American shipping and American ship building, and general bills to amend the laws relating to navigation and to prevent discrimination against Ameri can sailing vessels engaged In the coastwise- tra.de. In the house a large number of bills and joint resolutions were intro duced, many of them measures that failed during the! Ast session. Other bills introduced included the following: By Mr. Powers, of Ver mont, a bill to establish a uniform sys tem of bankruptcy; by Mr. McCall, of Massachusetts, to amend the Immigra tion laws; by Mr. Wilson, of Ohio, to equalize pensions on account of service in the Mexican war; by Mr. Mahon, of Pennsylvania, incorporating the Mari time Canal Company of Nicaragua, re ported by Representative Mallory from the commerce committee of the last legislature; by Mr. Chickering, of New York, to ascertain the feasibility and cost of constructing a ship canal from the great lakes to the Hudson river; by Mr. Mcßae, of Arkansas, to strike out the provision of the constitution against levying a capitation or direct tax (a result of the income tax decis ion); by Mr. Hermann, of Oregon, to abrogate the Clayton-Bulwer treaty; by Mr. Stone, of Pennsylvania, provid ing for the inspection of emigrants by United States consuls; by Mr. Mcßae, of Arkansas, to define trusts, and to au thorize the free importation of articles covered by them; by Mr. Johnson, of California, a bill to make it unlawful after Aug. 1, 1896, for any foreign-born laborer to enter the United States, and one to provide that no alien shall be admitted to citizenship in the United States who has for a continued term of five years preceding his admission resided within the United States and who cannot speak, read and write the English language. DULUTH-NORTH DAKOTA ROAt>. Bill for a Right of Way Through Minnesota Reservations. WASHINGTON.Dec. 3.—Representa tive Jenkins, of the Tenth Wisconsin district, today introduced a bill to grant the Duluth & North Dakota railroad the right of way through the Wlnnibigoshish, Cass Lake, White Oak Point and Red Lake reservations in Minnesota, such right of way to be fifty feet wide on each side of the cen ter line of said railroad, and said com pany also to have the right to take from the land adjacent to the line of said road material, stone and earth necessary for construction of said road, and also to take adjacent to such right of way land for depots, side tracks, etc., not to exceed 300 feet in width and 4,000 in length for each sec tion, to the extent of one station for every ten miles of road constructed within the limits of said reservations. It is provided that the secretary of the interior shall fix the compensation the Indians shall receive for the land taken from them. ■■ :.-.r.- - WJ*. ACTION IN WALLER'S CASE. Kansas Congressmen Will Call for . the Correspondence. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3— The Kansas delegation in congress is determined to leave nothing undone to secure the re lease of ex-Consul John L. Waller from imprisonment in France. After* the president's message had been read this afternoon the entire delegation of senators and members, including Re publicans and Populists, held a meet ing to decide on their course of ac tion. It was resolved to push a reso lution in both houses calling on the president .for all the papers and cor respondence in the case. Several mem bers thought that this resolution should be accompanied by one stating It to be the view of congress that the president should take immediate action, and ~uch a resolution may be decided upon at a • future meeting. From the information at hand the .members took exception to President Cleveland's view that the correspond ence- with France upon the matter is progressing satisfactorily. The only question raised was Whether or not -the .'reply to the resolution calling for papers should be awaited before more vigorous steps were taken. Represent ative Miller, from whose district .Wal ler was/appointed to his consulate, was empowered to draw the resolution', and he had a conference regarding- it to night with Mr.Hitt, the probable chair .'man of the committee on foreign af fairs. Representative Curtis, of Kan sas, has received many petitions call ing for strong action In the -Waller case, which he will present to the house. • . '-..-.'.. _£.'-'■.-;•'■ ." »m . At His Expense.

VARIOUS OPlfllOflS. COMMENTS OF CONGRESSMEN ON THE PRESIDENT'S MI'S- y] L v £ . SAGE. ';•;■ FAVORABLE EXPRESSIONS. INTEREST CENTERED MAINLY ON THE FINANCIAL, RECOM MENDATIONS. f. REPUBLICAN DISAPPROVAL. Party Opponents Were, However,' Pleased nt Cleveland's Posi tion on Foreign Affairs. WASHINGTON. Dec. 3. — Both curiosity and interest were manifest ed by the members of the house in the president's message. Members expressed surprise that no recom mendation was made for the supply of the treasury deficit. In the dis cussion of foreign affairs, the por tion devoted to the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine in connection with the boundary line dispute, and the suggestions regarding Cuba, at tracted especial attention, but the main interest centered in the recom mendations for the retirement of the greenbacks and the extension of the national banking system. Several of the Democratic leaders who differ with the president on the financial question refused to express their opinions for publication. The Republicans of the senate do not approve the message so far as it concerns finances. It matters not whether they be silver men or not, they all have something to say against it. Many senators expressed the opinion that the message was disappointing because it did not pro vide a method: for raising revenue. All of the Republicans who are known as sound money men were especially disappointed on account of this feature of the measure. The silver men were, of course, very em phatic. in theft disapproval of the president's views on silver. For the most part, however, the Republicans spoke in tones of approval of the position of the president regarding foreign affairs, but more especially what. he said about Venezuela. The silver Democrats had very little to say regarding the message, and it was for the most part a disappoint ment for them. There was a general impression . in the senate that the proposition of the president to re tire the greenbacks would not be successful. • 1 -- ■': 

ENGLISHMEN NOT PLEASED. Hardly the Kind of Message to Salt Their Feelings. _..-. LONDON, Dec! The newspapers tomorrow will very generally contain editorial comments on President Cleve land's message to congress. The Graphic will say: "The crud ities and indiscretions of President Cleveland's present pronunciamento on foreign affairs might' have been evolved by the late Mr. Blame in his worst mood. Can anything -be more absurd than the proposal that the Schomburg line (in Venezuela) should be submit ted to arbitration? .-* The reference to Cuba is infinitely more injudicious. It is virtually an expression of sym pathy with filibustering." The Times editorially says: "Pres ident Cleveland has drawn a startling picture of the difficulties created by the vicious, currency system and we shall be greatly, surprised if the plans he suggests are not warmly welcomed by the busines' men throughout the states. But, flushed by electoral vic tory, it is possible enough " that the Republicans will refuse to allow any thing to be done in the direction indi cated. Meanwhile, the remainder of the message, especially the reference to foreign relations, will give the im pression that he is marking time. Nothing he says commits him to a new or aggressive foreign policy, whilst it will task the ingenuity of his opponent to make out that he has in any way compromised the dignity or been care less of the interests of his own coun try." ' - *"'*. The ! Daily News, Liberal, will say: "President Cleveland knows better than to treat the Monroe doctrine as if it were a rule of international law. It is neither dignified nor polite foe the administration at Washington to take up the quarrels of South American communities which do not observe the usages of civilized nations. America will find some day that this sort of patronage involves a corresponding. re sponsibility, : and they will not like that at all." The Standard, Conservative, says* "We cannot but regret the tone of. President Cleveland's references to ' Venezuela.. . If we may judge of the tone and substance of Mr. Olney's dis patch from' the paraphrase thus ' im parted to .congress, . we are not sur prised that no answer has been, re ceived, and we further undertake to predict that when the reply reaches the White house it will furnish the presi dent with a deal of matter for serious consideration. We must be pardoned if we venture to say that the whole-pass age referring, to. Venezuela is a tissue of unreal assumption and 'unsupported deductions. If the Americans desire to carry out the views thus expressed; they will do so after due calculation of the cost. -Even if we were eager for 1 ar- ' bitration, the experience in the Bering Sea controversy would hardly encour age us. It is not easy to argue calmly when we flndi that President- Cleveland has already prejudiced the merits. of the dispute. But even strong states have rights, and though Great Britain is able to maintain its dignity and in terests, it ought not to be a mark for public affront in a presidential message. We are not much impressed with his currency proposals. He suggests a palliative, andl not a cure." The Post (Conservative) says: "As regards Samoa and Venezuela; the message appears to be framed an .lines Which Senator: Chandler might ap prove. In regard to Cuba, there are similar signs of disposition to conciliate the feelings of popular agitators. The?e things are incidents of every presiden tial campaign, and President Cleveland never pretended to 'be superior to them." An editorial in the Chronicle says: "It is very doubtful if congress will accept President Cleveland's currency plan. The message sounds cautious, but there is a welcome note in the di rection of free trade. The reference to Armenia. must be regarded' as" tne definite adherence of the United States to the -European concert. Pew honest critics can say anything against Pres ident Cleveland's reference to, Vene zuela. _ - • /We. agree with him that* the boundary dispute Is j eminently .'suited' to arbitration* and undoubtedly our government will. take the -"same view. It must be remembered that this ques tion is quite distinct from that .of the reparation . due us by , Venezuela* for" injuries*.' When such reparation - "made., every r Liberal " in" "this" country will acquiesce in' President Cleveland's doctrine.

V., Dec. 3— An im portant measure to be introduced in j the legislature during the coming session 'will be one to abolish expert i medical testimony in this state so far as it is now given by physicians and surgeons of any degree of ability who may .be called by the lawyers in a trial case.' During the last five years in this state both the medical and legal professions have viewed with alarm the ; growing frequency | of the: introduction of expert medi cal testimony, especially in cases of murder, when the defense has usual-* ly become to be a claim of insanity.
