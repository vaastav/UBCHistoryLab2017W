MILTON R. MOORE. Reeister. First publication Oct. 19, 1901. From the Grand Rapids (Mich.) Herald. One of tbe new sitij -cts likely to be recommended to congress for legisla tion by the president in his fori boom ing message is tint of national aid nr.d control of western irr-gation. This is the first message ev,?r written by a president upen whom the West feels it has a speciul claim. While President Roosevelt lives in the East, he has. nevertheless, been so closely identified whh the west and is so thorough y familiar with Western needs and con ditions, that the men of the plains just ly lay claim to hiin. Responding to tbe call from the West, it is understood that the new preiident will take a for ward position in favor of reciaimiug arid lands by government aid. There are hundreds of tbonsan Is of acres now lyinf waste w hicti need noth ing but water to fit tbein to support a large population. There "is water eaoujh iu the nvmulaius tt'id rivers to work the reelaioatioj of this vast empire, if only the water K properly distributed. Private enterprise has already worked wo iderful results in bringing abojt the desired end. But private energy caunol acompLsh l. e great work yet to be doue. It has simply deuioustrat.d a hit artidciai irrigation wtil do. Auo'.ner dalicully with private ocbemes is tual ni'iv of these irrigation caualsexti n I from one slate or territory to auother. More over, the rivers whose waters are de flected into the irrigation uitch.-s run from one state to auother. iu conse quence, many serious and long stand ing conflicts have arisnover tue rigots of tbe citizeus of different slaies to tue useof water courting Iro u otic sia.e to another. The whole subieet is akin to inlet stale commerce. Nstioual eon'.r.i is imperative. Stale coutrot will re-uh in constant conflicts inliAsaud juris diction. Such a situiiiim is uaAias and will not be tolerated a lo.,g wuile. Tbe eountry at large is iu need of more farmiug lunis Already p. ices of agricultural products are suo-viug a decided tendency to soar. The East is as much interested in the suujecla t ie West, since the industrial or isperity of the Atlantic states is dependent on tne supply of cheap foodstuifs from tue West. Congress should, therefore, not permit itself to be b.iuded by narrow and sectional arguments. Tiie suoject of national aid and control of irriga lion it one that should receive the care ful, ample and favorable consideration of the national lawmakers. aside by law fe educational purposes, shU be reserved as a special fund iu the treasury, to be known as the "ariJ laud reclamation, fund," for the con struction of reservoirs und for other irrigation works. The Secretary of the Interior, by meansof tliedirectur of the Geological Survey, is directed to continue tiie ex amination of that portion of the arid nnd semi-arid regions of the Unite! States, where ngri ;ni turn is c irrie 1 o i by means of irrigation, as to the ad vantages for the storage of water for irrigating purposes. Upon determinattoa by the Secretary of the Interior that any project of rec lamation is practicable, be shall let contracts for thtsconslruction of reser voirs, the payments to be made from the arid laud reclamation fund. And after the letting of the contracts has been determined upon, entries upon irrigable lauds adjie-nt to any such p o posed reservoir shall be permitted, under the provisions of the homestead law. Upon completion of any irrigation project, the total Cost shall be ascer tained and the am unit be divided, pro rata per acre of the lands irrigated, and the amount shall be made a c.are agaiusl the lands es the Cost of the right to use water from the syi tem of irrigation, and that ail sueh Undsshall be subject to homestead entry, after uotice by the Secretary of the Interior, upon the condition that, iu addition to the requir meats of the bumestead act, tbe eutryman shall make pa.vinrnt to the government of the coal per acre of the water rights ascertained, the payment to be made ia not to exei-ed ten annual instailmttn's, or audi less number as the entrymnn may elect, each entrymaa to Ue limited to tue en try and settlement of not to ex !eed eighty acres, and the m.ney received U to be covered into tue ari.i-L-.u.i reclamation fund . - Where lands under auy irrigation system are adapted to fruit growing, the Secretary of the Interior may further li nit the maximum amount to bi entered under su':h a ujvt-m by any out person. No patent shall issue until the charge against the laud for the cost of thi water right shall be fully paid and discharged. Senator Haoshrou.jh has borrowed one section from tiie Ne lands bill, providing that nothing in I. is proposed law shall be allowed to conflict with Slate laws bearing on the subject of irrigation, Th; Secretary of the In terior is atit. o. iz-d to immediately as certain what are arid and semi-arid anna. Prof. C. W. Wytia, who died a few d:iys ago, left no will as far as has been ascertained. The alleged discoverer of the greatest secret of the century breathed his last immediately afuir a surgical operation. The operation waa made necessary on account of strangulation of the intestines. Tne patient suffered intensely for mtny hours previous to the heroic attempt to save his life. Thelwo remaining mem bers of the syndicate which was orgauiz -d and incorporated to apply the Wyuu gold extraction process are in possession of the secret of the liqu.ds, and tne departure of one man will not seriously interfere with the plans which nave bsen under fornittiou for titrte moDtus past. -Denver News.

It has anestimated two hundred billion feet of merchant able timber, an amount that would al low of cutting at the present rate for' 100 years before its exhaustion. But the same wasteful methods prevail there which have denuded some of the older states of their timber, and there is the same lack of provision for the future. !
