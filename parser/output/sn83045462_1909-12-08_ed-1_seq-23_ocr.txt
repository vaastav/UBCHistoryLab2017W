SPECIALTIES QUITE ACTIVE President's Message One of the Fa vorable Influences on Trading. Money Conditions Unchanged. Sporial Dispatch to Th?* Star. NEW 

YORK. December S.-Whether it was the result of more mature considera tion of President Taft's message or a re sponse to favorable developments of a material sort, such as have been more or less neglectful of late, or a reaction from the excessive bearlshness with which the stock market following has recently been afflicted. Wall street had a better stock market today. It did not start that way, however. Afte" a steady opening profit-taking sales and bearish operations of a trad ing nature induced extensive irregularity and imparted a rather reactionary ap pearance to the list. The course of prices during most of the first hour encouraged the view that the market was more likely than not to re peat its characteristic record of the last few weeks by a day of decline following a day of advance, but around the middle of the forenoon, although trading was not particularly active, prices hardened, and In the early part of the afternoon the list had a distinctly strong appear ance. Although specialties were active the market enjoyed good all-around leader ship by standard stocks, both railroad and industrials. Comment on Message. On second ithought, Wall street un doubtedly came to the conclusion over night that the full effect of Mr. Taft's message had not been discounted by whatever advance information as to its contents was available in the financial district. The discovery was made that the message bad by its moderation and dignity made a desirable impression on the country at large. Moreover, it was inferred also that the manner and tone of Mr. Taft s first an nual communication to Congress were guaranties that a sense of sober responsi bility would characterize the President's treatment of such subjects as were rele gated to subsequent special messages. These considerations undoubtedly affect ed sentiment as revealed in today's stock market. Favorable Influence was also exerted by the important court of appeals' de cision regarding the power of the pub lic service commission. The ruling of the court that the state commissioners are aroused to determine only what it is lawful for a corporation to do and not the propriety or wisdom of its acts are is so eminently sane as to encour age the hope that a similar disclosure may some day be made at Washington with regard to the powers of the bu reaucratic bodies which have been or may be established there to supervise interstate commerce. Not Much in Day's News. Apart from these developments there was not much in the day's news, outside of reports of earnings, calculated -to af fect stock market dealings. Rumor about the continuation of the so-crflled copper negotiations was current, accompanied by talk of a coming curtailment of the metal output by large producers, but not much attention was paid to these matters. The railroad labor situation received the notice which it deserves, but whatever unpropi tlous aspect the demands about to be im posed on the railroads by their employes may have for net earnings appears to be offset by the potent argument for increas ing traffic rates with which the railroads will be supplied. Money conditions showed no change. 

COTTON MARKETS. NEW YORK, December 8.?The cotton market opened firm at an advance of 5aJ3 points this morning, and during the early trading sold 11 to 17 points net higher, with May contracts making a new high record for the season, and touching 15.39. This advance was on the firmness of the cables and the census report showing only 8,878,277 bales ginned ; to December 1, which was regarded as indicative of a sensationally small crop Realizing in advance of the government's estimate expected Friday was heavy, however, and the market during the mid dle of the morning was 3 or 4 points off from the best in consequence.

I LOCAL FINANCIAL NEWS. An upward tendency in the prices for traction stocks was noted at the meeting today of the Stock Exchange, but was not accompanied by much busi ness, as tiie better bid prices were an swered by an advance in the asking prices. Hut limited interest was shown in Washington gas stock. What was done was confined to two brokers, and the one who had the stock for sale out stayed tiie other one who was the main buyer. The entire amount of stock dealt ' in reached the total of ninety-two shares. The level of prices was below those of the previous day. and at the close tiie stock was to be had at 71%, with tiie bid at 71. The lowest point reached in the recent movement was recorded yesterday, when twenty-five shares sold for 72*4. In the meantime what has been re garded as a bull argument for this stock, the starting of tiie new gas company at Rosslyn. Ya.. is still available. The foundations are being laid for the new gas-making plant on land purchased by tlie company adjoining the power station ? >f the Old I>ominion electric road at the south end of the bridge. A gang of men is also at work digging a trench along the county road toward Clarendon, where the residents are to be supplied with gas. This work is be ing done, so it is announced, for the new company by the United Gas and Im provement Company of Philadelphia. The Bankers' Association of the Dis trict of Columbia has adopted resolu tions expressing the loss that banking circles and the community suffered by the death of R. H. Lynn, who "had won to an unusual degree the esteem and confidence of his business associates.'' Washington Stock Exchange.

The figures are given by bills, and show a total estimate for the next fiscal year, beginning July 1, of $;*78,12r>,769, as com pared with a total appropriation in the last session of $1,022,832,001, and total estimates of that session for $t.03N,:W7,508. The estimate is more than $80,00<?,u00 less than that of the previous session, and almost $45,<H?0.000 less than the actual appropriations of that session. Comparing the estimates for this session with the appropriations of that, the prin cipal falling off is an excess of $<j,0UO,<J00 in the army appropriation, more than $10.<KXM?00 in the navy, exceeding $5,00n. 000 for pensions, and something over *11,000.000 on the sundry civil bill. The Post Office Department calls for an increase of about ?S).000,000. An expendi ture of |D,G02,287 is suggested on account of rivers and harbors. BANKS AND PROSPERITY FINANCIAL CONDITION RE- j FLECTED IN REPORT. Total Resources Over Twenty-One Billions and Thirteen Thousand Millions on Deposit. If banking statistics are a true index to economic conditions, the people of the United States are enjoying a greater measure of prosperity than ever before. In an investigation recently completed by the national monetary commission is set forth data designed to throw light upon the monetary situation which will be of the greatest interest to bankers and financiers. The document in ques tion contains a compilation of the special reports of conditions which were ob tained from the banks during the past summer. The reports were designed to exhibit the exact condition of the banks, as shown by their books at the close of business April 28, 1909, and they present in detail every item of resources a.id lia bilities pertinent to the subject under in j vestigation. Practically every incorporated bank in the United States furnished a report for this investigation, and reports from a larger percentage of private banking con cerns than ever before made public were placed at the disposal of the commission. For the first time in the history of banking in the United States it has been possible as a result of this inquiry made by the commission to present data uni form in character and date from all .n stitutions engaged in banking through I out the country. The compilation thus ? comprises the most complete and com prehensive information relating to banks of the United States ever yet printed. The banks reporting for this investiga tion include 6,893 national. 11,310 state. 1,703 mutual and stock savings. 1.497 pri vate and 1,079 loan and trust companies. The total resources of all these banks reach approximately 21.1 billion dollars.

Following the special reports from the banks, a supplementary inquiry relating to character of deposits, depositors, in terest paid, etc.. was made by the com mission, to which 18,245 banks responded. The total deposits in these banks on or about June 1909, were 18,505 million dollars, credited to over 25 million de positors or deposit accounts, ranging from $1 upward. Nearly 15 million de positors had savings or time accounts, of which over 8,600,000 were depositors in savings banks.
