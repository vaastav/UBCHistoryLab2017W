They were received In accordance with thp established otlquel, and Judge Davis jllrcctml the Innnedluto reading of the message. It tvas written on paper having u deep black border, and no prlptcd copies wore’ fnnlshfid the Senators, as lias been done for some yours past. They listened to the reading, however, .with nn .usual attention, and thcro were frequent nods of approbation, especially by tho Re publicans. After tho voluminous document had been rend, opinions on it were freely exchanged among the Senators. Tho general verdict was a favorable- one. Every one liked tho frank, business-like, practical man ner hi which' tho President dealt with tho Important questions which ho successively took up, placing his vlows before Congress mid tho country wlfli nmnlsinknbJo clear ness for r Indorsement or rejection by tho legislators-and by the people. There was, perhaps, tod much detail. ' ' / 

I’HKSII>KNT IMIO TRM.

This'act on his part was made .without any previous advertisement, and Its .suddenness Took, OVory ond by surprise. It was lust after tho Clork had llnlßhed reading tho message, and *when tho ghllorles .wore Utmost empty and hardly a score of Senators were Id their places on cither side. Judge Davis, quietly, calling Senator Harris, moved down on tho floor and took a seat at his old desk. Senator Edmunds called up his reso lution providing that tho standing and select committees which expired with tho last ses sion bo revived mid continue for tho present session. Having got it under consideration, ho proceeded to modify it ho ns to make tho select committees existing during the session beginning the 4th. of March, iwi, como within its scope. This being agreed ’to. tho modlfled resolution whs put to th& Senate, -whereupon Judge Davis arose, and, .with sfcvdrnl pages of manuscript hi his hand, began-.his speech., Instant ly tlioro was ’attention In, tho cham ber, hnd, .from, tlio .curlously-nii,xlcms manner in which tho majority t>f tho .Sena tors on both sldds hung on hid words, It was evident that his intentions wero mysteries to all but one nr two persons on either Side.
