THE OTTAWA FREE TRADER. SATURDAY. DEC. 14, 1389. JFPE pWg. SUNDAY. Fire ctost roy.nl tin National Steam ship Company's dock at New York yes terday afternoon. Tho bodies of four workmen have In-eii taken from the ruins, and It is possible that others have perished. Five men worn rm rlous'y burned. Tho money loss is over $200,000. Tho steamer Manias from Ilray.il has arrived at Llslmn, on which were I)om Pedro and family In excellent health. Tho Iom described tho cap ture by the revolutionists, but de clined to talk of llrazilllan alTairs. A sneak thief at Wilmington, Del., seized a box of securities worth $:0, 000 from which a bank olllcer was cut ting off coupons, and escaped. Zeb Kennard at Sullivan, yesterday, got twenty-four years for horse-stealing. Horse flesh is valuable in South ern Illinois, it seems. TUESDAY. Speaker Iieed yesterday announced tho committees on ways and means, with McKinley of Ohio, as chairman; that on appropriation with Can non, of Illinois as its head. Kelly reads the committee on manufactures. These committees are all that are as yet announml; but they indicate that so far as the organization of the bouse is concerned, tho programme will ho to follow tho message by legislation In favor of the high tariff beneficiaries, rather than in favor of lower taxation. The Presidential party arrived In Chicago yesterday morning, and were escorted '.by a procession to the resi dence of V. W. Peck; in the afternoon there was a reception at the Union League Club; and in the evening they were present at the grand opening of the Additoriam building. The Erie County Atheletic Club offered a $.'10,xx) purse for a glove con test between Sullivan and Jackson, the colored pugilist. Looks a little odd, don't it, to see tho Chicago Tribune, Herald, Globe and Fetes enthusiastically united In suit port of a bolter ticket against regular party nominations. Tiah for Boodler Ticket No! No wonder prohibition has soured on the stomachs of tho Iowa people, when Mr. Collins, an honest farmer, who made nineteen barrels of cider, had it seized and confiscated as a vio lation of the liquor law. A free church at Oshkosh, Wis., has ex-communicated Its pastor for heresy by a majority of one vote. "Every man," says Dean Swift, "carries a lit tle pope in his belly." The majority of one man, it seems, held tho little p;)pe this time. Minnesota is rejoicing in a big lind of natural gas near Fairmont, In that .State. It was found at a depth of 42J feet, in boring for water, and came up through an lK-lnch hole with such force that on igniting it the llame shot up 20 feet In the air. Baltimore has a young man so sur charged with magnetism that any metallic substance, up to six pounds in weight, clings to his lingers. Can ada is harboringa lot of cashiers, bank tellers, etc., from this side who appar ently possessed the same peculiarity. President Harrison, after much hes itation, dually consented to honor the opening of tho big Chicago Auditorium on Monday evening with his presence. As the Chicago oftices are still undis posed of, he will probably receive near ly as much attention as llerrOrau and Mile. Patti. Surely that Is an impressive instance of the irony of fate that hmin Pasha should die from an unlucky tumble from a balcony after having success fully encountering all the perils of tho deadly climate of Africa, tho poisoned arrows of savage natives, the bullets and pikes of tho mahdis, and all the wild beasts and deadly serients. The Ming in tho President's message at the cattle kings "now occupying tho lands of the Cherokees for grazing purposes" as tho "chief obstruction to our negotiations with that tribe," Is generally interpreted as a direct stab at Senator Farwell and Gen. Alger, both of whom bold a high place in that notorious syndicate. What liecomes of the pennies? The mint bureau at Washington reports that according to their record there are at present over 700,000,000 of copier cents In circulation In this country, yet they are over-run with demands for pennies from tho business centers. The supply of nickels and dimes is also far short of tho demand As we predicted, the Citizens' move ment In Chicago to find five honest men to stand as candidates for drain age commissioners has resulted us un fortunately as that of the two great political parties. The Inter-Ocean "don't want to say nothin' against" the five men nominated by the citi zens, but "we arc entirely satisfied to have all candid, honest-minded citi zens compare the ticket with that of the Republicans." As all the men on the latter ticket are charged by the Democrats and admitted bytho7W une to be hoodlcrs, tills Is a clear Inti mation that the men on tint Citizens' ticket are of the same stripe. Un happy city! that can lind no men for a public trust but boodlers! And yet all parties argue that the drainage problem can never be successfully solved by a commission consisting of men who are after boodle. tiik sriiri.rs. Life Is too short In tho estimation of most men to be squandered on read ing "pub.-docs." of tho length or Sec retary Window's treasury report, yet then! aro divisions of It of reasonable length that one can read with inter est. Such Is his treat nt of tho sub- leet of tho surnliis revenue. For the year ending June 1 last, he says federal taxation brought Into the treasury, In round figures, t:w7,ono,wo, and during the current vear the income will 1m: altout $:Wj,0(H),ooO, making a total dur ing the two years of $772,000,000. 'j he total expenditures, Including pensions and interest upon the public debt, for tin-same two years he places at $."7.V 000,000, leaving a surplus for the two vears of $197,000,000 within a fraction of $100,000,000 a year drawn from tho ptjople aliovc i the needs of the govern ment, even after many undeniably ex travagant appropriations! That Is to say, taxes at the rate or nearly $2 for every man, woman and child, are annually paid to the govern ment in excess of Its needs. Tho peo ple of Illinois consider their annual assessment of taxes for state and county purjK)ses so high as in many cases to be a serious burden, yet they amount to little more than they pay to the general government over and alKve its needs! And this extortion has been irolng on not only for two years, but for ten years or more, and instead of trvimr to stop it, Congress has only gone on passing laws for its continuance. So superabundant have been the re ceipts, especially from tariff taxation, that the plethora has led to a state of carelessness, recklessness and dis honesty in the administration of the revenue laws at the custom houses that aro simply appalling. Ho de votes over a dozen of closely printed pages to the exposure of these frauds, which he mildly calls "faults of our revenue system," showing that in every conceivable way tho present tariff laws aro made instruments of fraud, injustice, oppression and rob bery. Yet. startling as tho exposure may seem, it is really an old story. Sec retary Manning made the same ex posure, and Falrchild repeated it, yet tho Hat having gone forth that under Republican rule there shall be no vital change In our system of tariff taxation, no cure of these crying evils need ever be looked for until once more the Democracy, the only party thatever had honest tariff reform at heart, shall obtain possession of the government House, Senate, and rresidenii 

TIIK SWAMI' LANDS MONKY. The financiers of tho County Hoard are in a strait. With a treasury empty and the old easy way of going to the bank, as in the good old days, be fore and during tint building of the Court House and Jail, cut off from availability, the question, how to raise the wind, is a really grave one. Tho question Is the more serious, in that the present shortage means not only a temporary squeeze, but one that will be repealed for several years to come, accompanied by tax levies that must reach tho constitutional limit. With an assessment for the whole county annually growing less and less, in order to keep pace in tho downward race of assessments the state over, a real financier would have seen tho necessity of a larger levy September a year than was made, in order to keep the treasury in funds. Instead of that, tho levy was reduced along with the assessment, and tho conse quence is a deficiency of about $;10,000 at this time, more or less great for years to come until tho highest possi ble legal levies coupled with economy shall wipe it out. Just when that time shall come tho assessment nat urally falling, and the expenses nat urally Increasing with tho growth of tho county the tlnanciers of the Hoard of the Norton typo may, per haps Ihs able to say; no one else can. The- Doc might ease up matters Just a little by returning that $1,000 grabVd In so questionable a way; but he Isn't built that way. Meantime, tho Hoard, like all men "In a hole," have to "resort," and now have turned to that old chestnut, the swamp lands indemnity fund at Wash ington as the Mecca of relief from the dilemma. Tho fact that the swamp lands fund Is now considered at all Is evidence of tho parity of the situation to a certain degree. Years ago, as regularly as tho drop of the chair man's gavel opened each quarterly session of tho Hoard, and the clerk had finished tho roll-call, and Fades or Hrer Fischer had moved that all bills be referred without reading, the clerk would announe that ho had re ceived a "communication" from Isaac R. Hltt, "state agent," on swamp lands, embodying a request to le em- Iwered to go ahead and collect the county's share of that fund for half the sum realized. And Justus regu larly Armstrong or Lewis or Uncle John Miller would cry "rats," or words to that effect, and Mr. Isaac R. llitt and his little paper would bo con signed to an early burial "on the table." 1 1 was never thought then that there was anything In the "swamp lands" business not even enough to let llitt go ahead and collect tho money at his own expense and divide. Kvery now and then, however, a newspaper para graph announces that sotno county in Southern, Central or Eastern Illinois has recovered a sum more or less great from the government which years ago sold tho lands and itocketed the money. It is Just barely possible there may have been some lands of tho kind sold In this county for which tho general government got the money which may yet bo recovered. It is really hard to say. Former reports made away back in the liO's on this subject show that there is or was very little. If the money is there tho county ought to have its grab at a full-to-overflowing treasury as well as all tho other gralc bers: but if tho holders of accounts due from the county at this time bank very much on getting their pay out of the swamp lands fund they'll go broke for some time to come, one imagines. 

JKKK. DAVIS. The death of Jefferson Davis, which occurred at New Orleans on Friday, causes about the same measure of sor row throughout tho south that stirred the north on the death of Gen. Grant. Though the leader of a lost cause, its righteousness was no less a conviction of the southern mind than was that of the Union cause of the northern, and the sacrifices of its leader in behalf of the former were no less effective to inspire gratitude and love on tho part of its adherents than If the cause had triumphed. Davis was a graduate of West Point and passed tho days of his earlier man hood in the army. As a lieutenant he served in the HIackhawk war, and no doubt trod the ground on which Ot tawa stands. Marrying tho daughter of his commander, then "Colonel" Zachary Taylor, he left the army, and was not heard of again as a military man until the outbreak of the Mexi can war. In that "scrimmage" he com manded a Mississippi regiment, and did splendid service at Monterey and Huena Vista. It was during the latter battle that ho executed that unique movement which would probably have loaded his name with ridicule ever after but for its splendid success. His regiment had rifles without a bayonet in them, but being threatened by a column of cavalry outnumbering him five to one. he received the charge by throwing his men Into the form of a V. the open side to the enemy. As Lombardini's column entered some ways within the V, the sudden dis charge of 700 eight-shooter rifles threw it into inextricable confusion, and Hragg's battery about tnis time coming to the rescue, that splendid column of Mexican cavalry was broken to pieces, part fleeing across the valley and the rest turning back to tho mountains. The writer had the happiness to wit ness that encounter with his own eye. Davis was apparently a good Union man until his defeat for tho presi dential nomination at Charleston in 18(10. Six months before that he had visited New England and made as good Union speeches as Webster him self could have made. Rut the split of the Democratic party on Douglas turned him to the South, and he soon championed all Its ultra state's rights notions, with tho right of secession and all its treasonable consequences. He Is gone; and though ho lived to be an octogenarian and survived the lost cause nearly a quarter of a cen tury, ho adhered to his faith In its righteousness to tho end, never asked for or would have accepted amnesty, and died the only citizen of the United States without a vote and the only Mexican veteran who could draw no pension. Here is an every day specimen of high tariff logic: Says the Inter-Ocean: "It Is a falsehood that the duty on wool, or anything else, acts as a bur den on the people. The result Is only higher wages. Nor aro woolen goods higher hero on account of the tariff than in England. In many cases they are sold cheaper here." If woolen goods are no higher here than In England what benefit Is there to the manufacturer in taxing them 70 per cent., and how can such tax help wages here? Your lies aro like Falstaff's "open, gross and palpa ble." It appears to be pretty well settled that the loss of the $71,000 stolen by Silcott, tho defaulting cashier of the sergeant-at-arms of the house, falls wholly upon the members of the house. The money was constructively paid to the memlters on their salaries, who receipted for it on Che pay-roll, but left it on deposit with Silcott to be checked against. It is true, the sergeant-at-arms is under londs for 50, 000, but It is for the performance of his duties, no part of which is to pay or hold on deposit the money of mem: Iters of the house; it is also told that Silcott had given a bond of $,"0,000, but it was to the sergeant-at-arms, to protect him from loss, and It is not shown that the latter has lost any thing. Silcott, now that ho has ''cut l irk," Is recollected by everybody as a notorious bad case. Ho was a well known gambler, and kept a mistress in an expensive establishment, though he had a wife and family. It seems amazing that such a man should have been so Implicitly trusted, yet his habits aro so common among his "bet ters" at Washington that they attract ed no special attention. MI.VKK. Wo have mentioned heretofore, in a general way, that tho plan of Secre tary Windom to deal with the silver question is to receive silver bullion at tho Treasury and issue paper on it at the bullion price. More in detail, as now presented In his report, his plan is to "issue treasury notes against do posits of silver bullion at the market price of silver when deposited, payable on (lemauu in suen quanuucsoi hiner bullion as will equal in value, at the date of presentation, tho number of dollars expressed on tho face of the note at tho market price of silver, or in gold, at tho option of tho govern ment; or in silver dollars, at the option of the holder." Of course tho plan volvesthe discontinuation of the coin age of silver, except at the option of the government. The plan has at least the merit of novelty. Though manifestly one that must delight the heart of the silver men, it was not even thought of at tho recent convention of the silver kings at St.Louis, who had nothing better to propose than the free coinage of silver. In their interest tho Windom plan Is certainly better. It gives them the same unlimited market for their bullion, and, as tho silver certificates are raised to the value of gold, it greatly enhances the chance of silver appreciating on the market. The arguments by which Mr. Win dom supports his plan aro ingenious. The silver dollar is worth but70cents, still depreciating the people will not circulate it, and nowhere outside of this country is it taken at its face value. Hy tho adoption of this plan each dollar in silver certificates would rep resent the equivalent of a dollar in gold, and they would circulate as readi ly in all countries as greenbacks do now. He has no apprehension that tho plan would swamp the country with bullion notes, as little silver be yond the product of our own and a few of the Mexican mines would be likely to be offered at tho treasury. Besides, if any such danger should occur, the issue of certificates could be stopped. The first and obvious objection that presents Itself to the plan is the over whelming Inducement it would offer to the silver kings, money kings, brokers and speculators of all kinds to manipu late the priceof silver. Nothing would Im? easier than to form gigantic combi nations for that purpose, and with the Secretary of Treasury as their natural head, that official would need to bo an angel of light in purity and Integrity not to yield to the temptation of his corrupt surroundings. Who but him self would have the fixing of the price of the bullion? Can any man of wo man born be safely entrusted with such power? Dr. II. W. Thomas, of Chicago, who a few years ago was a shining light of Methodism, but has lately been regard ed as somewhat off in the faith and is running an independent church, in his last Sunday's sermon repudiated the doctrine of original sin. "The common sense of mankind," he said, "cannot believe that they were in Adam. If the present generation are to be held responsible for what Adam did they will set up the claim that it is un-American, that they never voted for him." Meantime how does Dr. Thomas explain where this universal human cussedness come from? Mrs. Mackey, tho wife of the Califor nia millionaire, has brought the editor of the Manchester (England) Examiner to his oats for charging in his paper that before her marriage sho was a washerwoman. The editor has been compelled to apologize, pay the costs of prosecution, and contribute a lib eral sum to a charity to bo named oy Mrs. Mackey.

Many men have argued so long that the material hell of the Puritan does not exist, and questioned the duration of punishment, that they have come to doubt the existanco or any form of punishment. The idea of Christianity argues a punishment for sin.- Men can only differ as to the form and dur ation of punishment, not as to the fact of any. Hut when even the most gentle doctrine is accepted, is there anv hope for the man who sins? This soul of man, capable of immortal rri ii id. wined away, an nihilated, because of sin 1 Cast into outer darkness and oblivion because it would not follow the light that was given to it ! Dante and Milton, types of the mediavel theologian and the Puritan divine, gave a gross material istic description of bodily sufferings. These Ideas have passed away, and many seemed to think that hell must have gone with them. These are not pleasant subjects, but death, judgment and hell are as much parts of God's revelation to us as His love, goodness and mercy. It seems as if the pitiful, sublime story of the Cross ought to strike the right chords in human hearts. Put love the love of a dying God on the Cross does not move them. Much as I dislike these themes, I believe there are multitudes in side as well as outside of the church who need to be told of the aw ful fact of a terriable punishment awaiting the sinner.
