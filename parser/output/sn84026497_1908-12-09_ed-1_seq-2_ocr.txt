I THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. J. C. WINK, . Editor 4 Psoprictom. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1908 DECEMBER L 2 345 6X 8 9.101112 1114 15 16 II 18 19 202122232426' 27122915515111 I The President's Message. President Kooaevelt's last annual mes sage lo Congress was read In bn(b branches of the National legislature yes terday, and, aa uaual with all such docu ments emanating from our great chief magistrate, la a master-piece ol sound logic, reasoning and fairness In the die- cussiou of the vital problems which shall come before the Congress ol the nation No issue is overlooked, but every point is taken up by the President and bis views given in fearless, unfaltering way. The Republican prints the message In full on the first page today. Don't fall to read it. Mr. Bryan may decide to run again in 11)12 J .ist to see what he can do without the Uompers handicap. The Prohibition campaign in Pennsyl vania cost flO.055.CO. That Is neaily $2,000 more than the Democratic party expended, and is what the boys would term "going some." So far 14,000,000 has been spent by this country on the Panama Canal. If the flnUh is as good as the start the Amer ican people will be well satisfied with the work of construction. In the last two presidential elections Maryland has split its electoral vote. It is proper to add that the Democratic law regulating the count throws out many ballots on technical grounds. A rokntina has decided to spend f.V, 000,000 in army and navy preparation, Brazil Is building three leviathan battle ships. Mr. Hobson, beaded oil' In Japan, has a chance lo strike bis alarm bell in new quarter. Free traders who wsnl to boss tariff revision should be banded a copy of the tariff plank in the Republican national platform. The people have just approved the protection there set forth by a plural ity of over 1,100,000. The good time coming, which every body has been predicting and waiting lor, will tie the time when honesty and fairnes shall prevail iu railroading, manufacturing, politics, business and professional pursuits of every kiud, and in the social life of the nation. The list of contributors to the Republi can national campaign lund shows that the party has plenty of individual friends. Those who supposed that the war chest of the G. O. P. would suffer without the aid of corporations overlooked the general demand for safe and sane politics. It has been discovered In Philadelphia, as previously in Detroit, tbat rotten eggs are gathered and sold to some unscrupu lous bakers at 12 cents a pound, to be used in making cakea. The publio will be glad to bear tbat the United States authorities are in hot pursuit of dealers in tli is poisonous tilth for human consump tion. The Punzsutawney Spirit suggests our own Senstor Knox for the portfolio of Secretary or State in Mr. Taft's cabinet, but is puzzled to know where we should get a man big enough to fill Mr. Knox's place In the U. S. Senate. It's a strange thing if we have but one big man iu this great big State, aud we refuse to believe it. What's the matter witb the Editor of the Spirit himself? To our notion Br'er Smith sizes up all right, even to the mat ter of location. Witb this understanding we favor the promotion of Senator Knox to the new Taft cabinet. Pkonaiily it is not wise to check Im migration and yet it must be admitted that too many laborers are coming here from abroad, says the Franklin News. We have not enough employment, at times, for our own residents, and the custom of coming here from Europe, working during good times and then go ing borne again puts the burden of much of European mismanagement of govern ment and industries npon the American people. The policy of employing American-born, or at least English-speaking and naturalized workmen, will do some thing to discourage the nativea of other lauds who ocnteuiplale coming bere. To Florida goes the distinction of get ting the first national forest created east of the Mississippi river. President Roosevelt has just signed a proclamation setting aside and naming the Ocala Na tional Forest in Marlon county in east ern Florida, and another proclamation creatiug the Dakota National Forest iu Billings county, North Dakota. Inas much as the last named national forest is the fiist in North Dakota, the two procla mations add two more states to the list of those wherein laud will be put under scientific forest administration. There are now nineteen states, and Alaska, hav ing national forests. It is not probable tbat the present sea sion of Congress will do much besides passing the regular appropriatian bills, but President-elect Tall has said be will call the new Congress in special session euortly after his inauguration for the pur pose of making an honest revision of the tariff, Ue has also promised an imme diate establishment of postal savings b:uka and postal parcel delivery. The Iff baa Incurred the enmity of the banks druie country, and the second has incur red very great opposition from tbe six great express cotnpaniea of tbe country that are charging four times tbe price tbat the post offices would charge to carry parcels, when tbe postal parcels system is Inaugurated. These three items are the principle re;orma to be accomplished by tlie next Congress and Mr. Taft wants them accomplished thoroughly aud tr'oufptiy. ' KelletlvIHe W. C. T. V. Tbe W. C. T. U. of Kellettville has not been idle, but baa recently seen some specially good work accomplished. A parlor meeting was held at tbe home of our President, Mrs, Ellen Catlln, Nor. 5, 1008. Mrs. Lilly Dntterer, Superintend ent of Parlor Meetings, conducted tbe devotionals, after which the State report, sent by Mra. Huling, delegate from Tio nesia, was read. A great Interest was taken In this report and all present de clared it most excellent. A rising vote of tbauks was tendered Mrs, Huling for It, All expressed regret tbat she was un able to be witb us and read it for us. An excellent lunch was served and the ladies all felt tbat It was good to be one of tbe W. C.T. U. TbeW. C. T. U. of May burg was Invited to be present and waa represented by Mrs. Hartman. At a bus iness meeting held at tbe home of Mrs. Anna L. Watson, Nov. 251b, it was decid ed to bold a market Saturday afternoon, Deo. Stb, for the purpose ol raising funds for further work. A barrel of dry goods, canned fruit, etc., and other necessaries, was packed sod sent to tbe Florence Cr It tendon dome at Erie, in charge of Miss Margaret Small. This would prove to be of use to tbe institution, as tbe value was listed at nearly forty dollars.' A fine luncb was served during the meeting by Mrs. Watson. Mrs. Henderson, Press Supt, Neighborhood Notes. Franklin's school board has been pay ing $2,000 a year for g is and thinks it too much. Sure. Eggs are selling in Pittsburg for 52 cents a dozen and the supply is reported so small that dealers limit their sales to each customer. Rev. Anthony J. Lindsey, aged Ti years, brother of Judge Lindsey o' War ren, died at bis home In Jamestown, N. Y., on tbe 28th ult. A Bradford oil man tella tbe Era tbat at least 500 wells (bat should be producing oil are shut down in the Bradford field owing to tbe scarcity of water. Miss Mary Wilson, for more than fifty years continuously a teacher in tbe Punxsutawney schools, died on the 1st lost, at tbe age of 73 years, beloved and mourned by tbe entire populace. Lemuel D. White of Say brook, Warreo county, aged 74 years, and quite deaf, was killed Wednesday on a P. & E, rail road crossing at tbat blace, having failed to bear tbe whistle of an onootning gravel train. Tbe opinion is freely expressed tbat Anna Peeler, who is In jail at Kmetbport, McKean comity, for tbe shooting of Roy Warner at Bradford last July, will go free. Although the circumstances sur rounding the shooting of Warner point lo Miss Peeler as tbe guilly person, there is a lack of direct evidence io tbe case. An abandoned borse recently found In an unused barn belonging to George Merkle, in Troy twp., Crawford county, it is thought may be the one stolen from II. M. Long, of Knox, on the night of October 27. Tbe animal bad been dead for some time and was discovered by two men who saw the buggy standing near tbe barn. Amos Clements, colored janitor of tbe G. A. R. rooms in tbe armory building at Frauklin, which was burned two weeks ago, was arrested on Saturday afternoon for having, it is alleged, stolen a quantity ot household goods stored in a section of the building wbicb did not burn at tbe time of the fire. Clements Is also sus pected of having set ffre to tbe armory Dunning, out maintains nts innocence. Slate Forestry Commissioner Conklin has ordered tbat tbe state's tree nurseries in Tioga and Franklin counties be in creased in size and that more trees than ever be set out this spring. Tbe Asaph nursery iu Tioga will he raised from five to twenty acres and Mont Alto nursery from five to twelve.
