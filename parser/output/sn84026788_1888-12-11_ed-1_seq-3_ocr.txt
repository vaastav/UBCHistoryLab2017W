SPIRIT OF JUFFERSON. CHAH1.18TOWN, JBTFXHSOU COOHTT, W. Va. TUESDAY HORNING. DECEMBERII. 1888. It may be that our friends have concluded that a newspaper can be run without money, and we must con fess that present appearances do make it look as if they had really come to that conclusion. We would like to disabuse their minds in this regard, however, and would seriously remind them that it does take money to run a newspaper, also a good deal of it, and that cash down every week. Just at this time we need a little more than usual, but our receipts are working just the other way, and we are getting less. Our people have been blessed with good crops of all kinds, and in their prosperity should not forget therr obligations to the printer. We therefore hope they will heed this gen tle reminder, and call at the Spirit office and settle their dues. The question of adopting a registra tion law in this State is being advo cated. The Wheeling Register sends out a Yery handsome mammoth calendar for 1889, for a copy of which we re turn thanks. Thanks to Capt. Jas. H. O'Ban non, Superintendent of Public Print ing of Virginia, for a copy of his Annual Report. Major-General Romeyn B. Avers, of the U. S. Army, died on Tuesday at Ft. Hamilton, N. Y. He married a daughter of our former countyiuon R. Hume Butcher. The Republican commissioners of Kanawha county, have thrown out enough Democratic votes to clecf McGinnis, Republican, to Congress by 23 majority. The matter will be taken to the Circuit Court by the Democrats. The Martinsburg Statesman has been sold to Messrs. D. C. Westen baner and C. W. Boyer. We extend our best wishes to the retiring editor, Capt. W. B. Colston, and extend to the new purchasers a hearty welcome to the journalistic circle. Col. Samuel Spencer has been re elected President of the Valley Rail road, which extends from Harrison burg to Lexington. At his own sug gestion his salary was reduced from $2,000 to $100! Col. W. M. Clements of the B. & O. was appointed man ager at $300 per annum. The United State J government has ordared several^^^ftr war steamers to proceed back the de_ seized at Port ai tien provisional Hrce by the Hay criunent. ? Arrests by the Federal authorities for illegal voting still continue in ?Wheeling. So far eight persons, all Republicans, have been tafcea into custody, and many additional war rants are out. In Mercer connty, where the Republican majority reached proportions plainly indicating fraud, the grand jury has returned 700 indictments for illegal voting. In"another column will be found a tableof the popular vote for President. It will be seen that Cleveland has a total of 487,617 votes; Harrison has ?473,054. Were the President elect ed directly by the people instead of by the electoral college, President Cleveland would be his own succes sor by 14,063 plurality; but as it i9, Mr. Harrison is the President-elect by a majority of 65 electoral votes.? It isn't always the majority that rules, you see, as 14,063 more votes were cast for Cleveland than for Harrison. The President's message is a strong document, and is sound on the tariff question. He not only fails to indi cate a single regret for his previous course on this subject, but fortifies and reiterates what he has before enunciated, and declares that '? any intermediary between the people and their government, or the least delega tion of the care and protection the government owes to the humblest cit izen in the land, makes the boast of free institutions a glittering delusion and the pretended boon of American citizenship a shameless imposition." The Canadian fisheries question, the Sackville case, the Haytien outbreak and other matters, are treated in an able aud statesman-like manner. The Mouroe Watchman thinks ** The Dem ocrats of the West Virginia House of Delegates should honor themselves by electing Col- R. P, Chew, of Jefferson county, to the Speakership There is not a more courageous, able and hon able man in the Legislature, nor one so well fitted to discharge the duties of this important position. He h:\f> always been on the side oj the people, and at the last session of the leg islature was conspicuous among the supporter! of the bills prohibiting discriminations iti rail road charges, prohibiting the free pass bribery, and providing for the reform of our tax laws. AUof these measures, in which the welfare ol the State" is profoundly interested, were suspi ciously defeated in the last Legislature. Thcj will be re-introduced at this session, and it ii important to the people that one of Colone' Chew's stamp and known convictions should preside during their consideration. Elect Chew Speaker by all means." The Jefferson people will b? gratified by the complimentary tcrmi in which the naUhman refers to Col. Chew anc would be pleased to see him elevated to th< Speakership of the House of Delegates. He ii a man of ability and has the courage of hii convictions, and would dlguify the Chair. [Frm Prm. An Atrocious Lie. [From the 3bepberdstown Register.] The following article appeared in the Phiadelpkia Press of Friday last: Siiephekdstowx. W. Va.. Not. 38.?TbUU one of the places In West Vlrgluia where it wau dangerous for a Republican to rote. The town and county are entirely under the control ol the Democrats. Before the election they made threats that they would allow no negroes tc vote unless thev voted the Democratic ticket, or at least for Free-trader William L. Wilson, for Congress. On election day James Roblnc [Robinson], who bad a little more courage than other members of his race, went to the polli and said be would vote despite their protests. One of the Democrats caught bim by the back of the neck and jerked him away. He was driven from the place and colored men gener ally made themselves scarce after that. A number of heelers from Baltimore and Wash ington were brought np on the train and after voting stood around and solicited votes from the residents of the town. Thomas R. Ray fJohn R. Ray], one of the oldest Republican! a Jefferson County, watched these people vot ing. During the daj' he took the names ol twenty-five men whom he knew to be residents of Baltimore and Washington. The friends ol Free-trader Wilson threw thousands of dollars into the district and Shepherdstown got con siderable of this. The night before election twenty men were picked up on the streets by the Democrats, taken to the office of a prominent gentleman and kept drunk until after the polls closed on election day. Five of these men have since declared their willingness to make an affidavit to the effect that they were locked in the room until it was too late to vote. A band of moun taineers who rode up to Harper's Ferry voting district came here aleo and in the same man ner put in their votes. They came from the direction of Shenandoah, and it is alleged that they voted there, as there are only a few voters ill that district, but the vote was 95 Democrats and 4 Republicans. This district has thirty colored men, yet only four Republican ballot's were cait. At the Shepherdstown votlne place before the polls closed some of the ballot-boxes were removed ro the office of Joseph Bragonler. a Democratic lawyer, and the contents counted there. H hen the polls closed the rest of the ballots were taken over and counted. James D Favman. one of the clerks of the board, in speaking of the matter said: *' The board left about twenty ballots in the box. so that, if there were too many ballots they could easily dispose of thorn. When we finished counting there were five ballots more than there were voters, and five Republican votes were thrown out." Mr. Faj'man. John R. Roy and J. 8. Fleming have made affidavit to the fact that the ballot boxes were removed. United States Senator Faulkner lives at Mar tinsbure. Berkeley county. The night before the election he had a number of colored and white Republicans from the city taken out to a house in the country, where a dance was given them. They were kept there until the next, morning and liquors of all kinds flowed freely As a result there were a number of Republican votes missing the next day This ruse did not. however, prevent Mr. Faulkner's county, hitherto Democratic, el vine a Repub lican plurality, thoueh the United States Sena tor stood at the polls all day and worked for his ticket. A more outrageous set of lies were never perpetrated on a community than are contained in tlio above arti cle. It is false in its statements and false in its implications. There was never a fairer, a more quiet or a more orderly election held in Shepherds town than that of the Bth of Novem ber last. Not one person who de sired to vote was intimidated or re strained from doing so, and every one legally entitled to the privilege was allowed to cast his vote to suit himself. The article is a lie in full, and it is a lie in detail. The following card, written by Mr. J. S. Fleming and endorsed by Messrs. Fayraan ajid Ray, is certainly all the denial necessary so arc concerned: especially my Den [ fullyv traduced. 8< scarcely a scintilla ol WUWTOi the w It is stated that Jas. P. Fayman. John and myself made affidavit tbut the t.?Uot boxes were removed. The facts are as follow? : Jas. D. Fayman made an affidavit before me as No tary. substantially as follows: That be bad challenged five persons as non-residents, who were allowed to vote by the Commissioners, and that the ballot boxes were taken to the office of J. S. Brafconier and counted. .Ttio. R.'Rsiyand myself certified to the correctness of that ? Nearly every voter knows that tit every election here since we have had a Board of Cauvassers the ballot boxes have been taken to another place and counted. I served as a canvasser at three different elections. The ballots were al ways counted at another place. I was present' at tho la?t election, and when the count was finished there wan only two (2) ballots In the box, when the number equal to the votes had been couuted; these were uot unfolded at the time. As to the threats made or the statement that it was dangerous for a Republican to vote, I only have to say that J hare lived here nearly 50 years and every one knows I am a Republi can. but the article abQve mentioned is the first I heard of any threats. There was no intim idation. no violence, and 1 am satisfied every one entitled to vote had the privilege of doing po unmolested. There were no mountaineers who rode from Harper's Ferry or any where else and voted here. The statement about Jas. Robinson being jerked back and driven from tho place is entirely without foundation, ns is also the statement that twenty men were picked up on t!i^i streets before election by the Demo crats and kept in durance until too late to vote. In conclusion let me say that the other gon tlcmcn. both Commissioners and Canvassers, need no vindication at my hands. They are gentlemen above reproach, and would not be a party to any snch proceedings referred to in the article of the Press. There was a differenceof opinion among the Commissioners as to the qualification of a few voters. I supposed the affidavit of Mr. Fay inan to test, that question, or I should not have certified to it. although the facts as there Ftated arc known to all. Respectfully Yours. ttc.. J. S. Filming. Republican Com. of Election. Endorsed: J. D. Fayman. Republican Clerk of Election. John R Rat. It gives us pleasure to print, in addition to the above, the following letter from Towner Schley. Esq., a life-long Republican, but a gentleman who cannot see his home slandered without entering his protest: Mr. Editor? I suppose my loyalty and polit ical proclivities are established beyond cavil as a pronounced working Republican, and the further fact that I was present the entire day at the late election in 8heplicrdstown. working and voted for Harrison. Morton. Flick, and the gallant Goff. and while a Republican from principle, I cannot remain dumb to the gross misrepresentations and prevarications of truth published in the Philadelphia Prt*s of the80th ultimo, regarding the actions of my Demo cratic friends and neighbors at the late'election. I: is true that the canvassers counted the votes in J. S. Bragonier's office, but the same thing lias been done at every erection held iu Sbep herdstown fo* several years, and it is well known that the gentlemen conducting the late election arc men of irreproachable characters and would not be gallty of intentional frand. As to the charge of th?*ats and driving voters from the polls, it is a dc.iberate falsehood. X never saw a fairer election >j0 voter was in terrupted from casting his biotas hedesired. Good order prevailed tho entire ?\ay# As to the charge of 20 voters being kept night in a prominent man's office and kept fnwtj voting, it is equally false and absurd. IfS^trne % number of voters from Baltimore und ^MW ington came here to vote, some of whom v^tgl the Republican ticket, and the same pmrtTV^ have been voting iu Shcpherdgtown at past elections. In conclusion I condemn in totothe article alluded to as slanderous, unmanly and a gross misrepresentation of facte. Yours, Ac.. Towkkr 8chl*t.
