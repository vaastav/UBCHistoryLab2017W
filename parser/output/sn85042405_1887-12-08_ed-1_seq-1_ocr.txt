"WASHINGTON, Dec. 7—The 'president ihas-sent the following message to con­ gress: To4he Congress of the United States: You-are confronted at the threshold of your legislative'duties wiih A condition of national finances which imperatively demands immediate and careful-consider­ ation. The amount of money annually exacted through the operation of the present laws, from the industries of the people, largely exceeds the sum necessary toimeet the expenses of the government. When we consider that the theory oof our-institutions guarantees to every citi zemthe full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise, with only such deduction as may lie his share to­ wards the maintenance iof the govern­ ment which protects him, it is plain that the exactiou-of more than this is inde­ fensible extortion and culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This wrong reflected on those who bear the burden of national taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil consequences. The public treas­ ury, whieli should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to its legitimate objects of .expenditure, be «omes a hoarding place for money need­ lessly withdrawn from trade and the peo­ ple's use, ffchus crippling our national energies, suspending our country's .de­ velopment, ^preventingdnvestment in pro •ductive enterprise, threatening financial disturbance-and inviting: schemes of i»ub liciplunder. llhis condition ofotrr is not: al­ together new, and ifcbasi more than once of date been submitted to the people'® re­ presentatives in the .congress, who alone cam i^pply a (remedy. And yet the situa­ tion «till continues with.aggravated inci­ dents more ifchan ever rieiacingMiianctal Convulsion and Wide- Spread Disaster. Jt-willnafc do to neglect this situation because its .dangers are .not now plainly imminent.and apparent. They exist nana the less certainly, and .await the unfore­ seen, and unexpected occasion when sud­ denly they will precipitate.upon us. On the 3(Mi day of June, 1885, the ex­ cess .of revenue over public expend turea after complying with the annual require­ ment of the sinking-fond ,«,ct, was $17f 829,735.34 draring the year ending June 30, 1886, such excess amounted to $49, 405,545.20 and during the year ending Jnne"30, 1887, it reached thessum of $55, 567,m54. The annual contributions tto the sink­ ing fund during the three years above specified, amounting in the aggregate to $138,058,390.94, and deducted from the surplus as stated, were made by calling in for that purpose outstanding 3 per cent, bonds af the government. During the six months prior to June -30,1887, the snrplus revenue had grown so large by repeated Accumulations, and it was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the people would so affect the business of the country that the sum of $79,804,100 of such surplus -was applied to the payment of thejirinci jpal and interest of the 3 per icent. bonds still outstanding, and •which were then available at the •option of the government. The precarious condition of financial .affairs among the' people sttH needing relief, im­ mediately after the 30th day of June, 1887, the remainder of the 3 per cent, bonis then outstanding, amounting with principal and interest to the sum of $18, 877,500, were called in and applied to the •inving fund contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these op­ erations of the treasury department rep­ resentations of the distress in business circles not only continued but increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand. In these cineu instances the contribution to the fund for the cur­ rent ftaeal year was at once: completed by the expenditure of $27,684, 283.55 in tike purchase of government bonds not y«t due bearing 4 and 4% per «ent. interest, the premium paid thereon averaging about 24 per cent, for the former and 8 per cent, for the latter. In addition to this the interest accruing dur­ ing the current year upon the outstand­ ing bonded indebtedness of the govern­ ment was to some extent anticipated, MM! banks selected as depositories of publie money were permitted to some­ what increase their deposits. While the expedients thus employed to release to the people the Money Lying Idle In the Treasury served to avert immediate danger, our rev enne have continued to accumulate, the excess for the present year amounting on the first day of December to $55,258, 701.19, and estimated to reach the sum of $113,000,000 on the 30th of June next, at which date It is expected that this sum, added to prior accumulations, will swell the surplus in the treasury to $140, 000,000. There seems to be no assurance that, with such a withdrawal from use of the peoples' circulating .medium, our busi­ ness community may not in the near future be subjected to the same distress which was quite lately produced from the same cause, and while the functions of our national treasury should be few and simple, and while its best condition would be reached, I believe, by its entire disconnection with private business in­ terests, yet when, by a perversion of its purposes, it idly holds money uselessly subtracted from the channels of trade, there seems to be reason for the claim that some legitimate means should be devised by the government to restore in an emergency, without waste or extrav- HSrJsT ngance, sucn money to its piace among the people. If such an -emergency arises there now exists no clear and undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore the redemp­ tion of 3 per cent, bonds, which were payable at the option of the government, has afforded a means for the disburse­ ment of the excess of our revenues but these bonds have all been retired, and there are no bonds outstanding the pay­ ment •ol which we have the right to insist upon. The contribution to the sinking fund which furnishes the occasion for ex­ penditure in the purchase of bonds has been Already made for the current year, so that there is no outlet in that direction. In the present state of legislation the only pretense of any existing executive power to restore, at this time, any part of our surplus revenues to the people by its expenditure consists ia the supposi­ tion that the secretary oC the treasury may enter the market and purchase the bonds of the government not yet due at a Tate of premium to be agreed upon. The only provision of law from which such a tpower could be derived is found in an ^appropriation bill passed a number of .'years ago and it is subject to the suspi­ cion that it was Intended Temporary and Limited in its apDlication, instead of conferring a continuing discretion and authority, No condition ought te-exist which would justify the grant of jpower to a single official, upon his judgment of its neces­ sity, to withhold from or release to the business of the people, in an unusual manner, money held in the treasury, and thus affect, at his will, the financial situ­ ation of the country and if it is .deemed wise to lodge in ithe secretary of the treasury the authority in the present juncture to purchase bonds, it should be plainly vested, and provided as far as ^possible with such checks and limitations as will define this official's right and dis­ cretion, and at the same time relieve him from undue responsibility Jn considering the question of purchas­ ing bonds, as a means of restoring to cir­ culation the surplus money accumulat­ ing in the treasury, it should be borne in mind that premiums must of .course bo paid upon such purchase, that there may be a laige part of these bonds held as in­ vestments which cannot be purchased at any price, and that combinations among holders wtfio are willing to sell, may un­ reasonably enhanoe the cost iof these bonds sfco (the government. It has ibeen suggested that the present bonded .debt might be refunded at a less rate.of interest, and the difference between ithe old and the new security paid in cash, thus finding use for the sur­ plus in the treasury. The success.of this plan, it is apparent, must depend upon the volition of the holders of the present bonds .and it is not »enti rely certain that the inducement which must be offered them would result ia more flnaraeial bene­ fit to the.government than the purchase of bonds, while the latter proposition would reduce the principal of the debt by actual .payment instead of extend­ ing it. Tim proposition to Deposit Money held by the government in banks throughout the country for use by .the people is, it.-seems to .me, exceedingly ob­ jectionable in principle, us establishing too close a .relatioiiship betwecn the oper­ ations of the government treasury .and the business of the country, and too ex­ pensive a commanding of their money, -.thus fostering .an unnatural reliance in private business upon .public funds. If ythis scheme should be adopted it should •only be done .as a temporary expedient .to iraeet an urgent necessity. Legislative aud executive effort should generally be in the oppositedireetion, ami should have .-a .tendency to divorce, as much and as last as can safely be done, the treasury .department from private enterprise. Of course it is not espectedithat unnec­ essary and extravagant appropriations will be made for (the pjjxpose of avoiding Ahe:accnmulation.of an«xcess of revenue. Such expenditure, beside the demoraliza­ tion .of .all just conceptions of public duty which it entails, stimulates a .habit of reekless improvidence not in the least consistent with the mission of our people or the high and beneficient purposes of onr government I have.deemed it my duty to to tons bring to the knowledge of my country­ men, as well as to the attention of their representatives charged with the respon­ sibility of legislative relief, the gravity of our financial situation. The failure of the congress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident .the very nature of the difficulty must Necessarily produce, caused a condition .of financial distress and apprehension since your last adjournment, which taxed to the utmost all the authority and ex­ pedients within executive control, and these appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued inac­ tion of congress, the responsibility Miiat Rest Where it Belong*. Though the situation thus far con­ sidered is fraught with danger which should be fully realized, and though it presents features of wrong to the people as well as peril to the country, it is but a result growing out of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause, constantly reproduc­ ing the same alarming circumstances a congested national treasury and a depleted monetary condition in the business of the country. It need hardly be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a like predicament in the future by the removal of its cause. Our scheme of taxation, by means of which this needless surplus is taken from the people and placed in the public treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal revenue taxes levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spirit­ uous and malt liquors. It must be con­ ceded that none of the things subjected to internal revenue taxation are, strictly speaking, necessaries there appears to be no just complaint of this taxation by the consumers of these articles, and their seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any por­ tion of the people. Bat our present tariff laws, the vicious, inequitable and illegal source of unnec­ essary taxation, ought to be at once re­ vised and amended. These laws, as their primary and plain effect, raise the price to consumers of all articles imported and subject to duty by precisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who purchase for use these imported articles. Many of these things, how­ ever, are raised or manufactured in I *v h. a'i VOL XI 

TAMESTOWN, DAKOTA, THURSDAY DECEMBER 8 our own country, and the duties now levied upon foreign goods and products are called protection to these home manu­ facturers, because they render it possible for those of our people who are manufac­ turers, to make these taxed articles and sell them for a price equal to that de­ manded for the imported goods that have paid customs duty. So it happens that while comparatively a few use the im­ ported articles, millions of our people who never use and Never Saw any of the Foreign Products, purchase and use things of the same kind made in this country, and pay therefor nearly or quite the same changed price which the duty adds to the imported arti­ cles. Those who buy imports pay the duty charged thereon into the publio treasury, but the great majority of our citizens who bay domestic articles of the same class, pay a sum at least approxi­ mately equal to this duty to the home manufacturer. This reference to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruction but in order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner in which they impose a burden upon those who consume domestic pro­ ducts as well as those who consume im­ ported articles, and thus increase a tax upon allour people. It is not proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation. It must be ex­ tensively continued as the source of the government's income, and in a readjust­ ment of our tariff the interests of Ameri­ can labor engaged in manufactures should be carefully considered, as well as the preservation of our manufacturers. It may be called protection or by any other name, but relief from the hardships and dangers of our presemt tariff laws should be devised with especial precau­ tion -against imperiling the existence of our manufacturing interests. But this existence should not mean a condition which, without regard ta the public wel­ fare, or a national exingency,must always insure the realization of immensa profits instead of moderately profitable returns. As the volume and adversity of our na­ tional activities increase, new recruits are -added to those who -desire a continua­ tion-of the advantages which they con­ ceive the present system of tariff taxation directly affords them. So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the present condition been resisted by those of our fellow citizens thus engaged that they can hardly complain of the suspicion, en­ tertained to a certain extent, that there exists an Organized Combination all Along the Line to maintain their advantage. We are in the midst of centennial celebrations, and with becoming pride we rejoice in American skill and inge­ nuity., in American energy and enterprise, and in 3»e wonderful natural advantages and resources developed by a century's national growth. Yet when an attempt is made to justify a scheme which •permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in the land for the ben­ efit of our manufacturers, quite beyond a reasonable demand for governmedtal re gard, it suits the purposes of advoeacy to call our manufactures infant industries, still needing the highest and greatest de gree of favor and fostering care that can be wrung from federal legislation. It is also said that the increase in the price of domestic manufacture resulting from the present tariff is neccessary in order that higher wages may be paid to our workingxnen employed in manufact­ ories, than are 'paid for what' is called pauper labor of Europe. All willac knowledge the force, of an argument which involves the welfare and liberal compensation of our laboring people Onr labor is honorable in the eyes of ev«ary American citizen as it lays the fomadation of our development and progress, it is entitled, withont af­ fection or hypocrisy to the utmost regard. The standard of our laborer's life should not be meas ured by that of any other country less favored, and they are entitled to their full share of all our advantages. By the last census it is made to appear thai of the 17,392,099 of our population engaged in all kinds of industries, 7,670,493 are em­ ployed in agriculture, 4,074,238 in profes­ sional and personal service 2,944,857 of whom are domestic servants and laborers while 1,810,256 are employed in trade and transportation and 3,837.112 are classed as employed in manufacturing and min­ ing. For present purposes, however, tW last number should be considerably re­ duced. Without attempting to enum­ erate all it will be conceded that there should be deducted from these which it includes 375,143 carpent ers and joiners, 285,401 milliners, dress makers and seemstresses, 173,726 black smiths, 133,756 tailors and tailoresses, 102,473 masons, 76,241 butchers, 41,309 bakers, 22,083 plasterers, and 4,891 en­ gaged in manufacturing agricultural implements—amounting tn the aggre­ gate to 1,214,023, leaving 2,623,089 persons employed in such man­ ufacturing industries as are Claimed to be Benefited by a High Tariff. To these the appeal is made to save their employment and maintain their wages by resisting a change. There should be no disposition to answer such sugges­ tions by the allegation that they are in a minority among those who labor, and therefore should forego an advantage in the interest of low prices for the majority their compensation, as may be affected by the operation of tariff laws, should at all times be scrupulously kept in view and yet with slight reflection they will not overlook the fact that they are con­ sumers with the rest that they, too, have their own wants and those of their fam­ ilies to supply from their earnings, and that the price of the necessaries of life, as well as the amount of their wages, will regulate the measure of their wel­ fare am! comfort. But the reduction of taxation de­ manded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the workingman nor the lessening of his wages and the profits still remaining to the manufactnrer.aftcr a necessary readjustment, should furnish no excuse for the sacrifice of the interests of his employes either in theiif oppor­ tunity to work or in the diminutation of their compensation. Lor can the worker in manufactories fail to understand that while a high tariff is claimed to be neces­ sary to allow the payment of remunera­ tive wages, it certainly results in a very large increase in the price of nearly all sorts of manufactures which, in almost countless forms, he needs for the use of himself and his family. He receives at the desk of his employer his wages, and perhaps before he reaches his home is iff-m-i 

WEEELI obliged, in a purchase for family use of an article which embraces his own labor, to return in the payment of the increase in price which the tariff permits, the hard-earned compensation of the many days of toil. The farmer and the agriculturists who manufacture nothing, but who pay The lu«:re»K Price Which the Tariff Impost's upon every agricultural implement, upon all he wears and upon all he uses and owns, except the increase of his flocks and herds and such things as his hus­ bandry produces from the soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the present situa­ tion and he is told that a high duty on imported wool is necessary for the bene ft of those who have sheep to shear, in order that the price of their wool may be increased. They, of course, are not reminded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged, in his purchase of cloth­ ing and woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer as well as to the man­ ufacturer and merchant nor is any men­ tion made of the fact that the sheep owners themselves and their households must wear clothing and use other articles Manufactured from the wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus as consumers must return their share of this increased price to the tradesman. I think it may be fairly assumed that a large proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers throughout the country are found in small flocks, numbering from twenty-five to fifty. The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep yield is 10 cents each pound if of the value of 30 cents or less, and 12 cents if of the value of more than 30 cents. If the liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would be 00 or 72 cents, and this may be taken as the utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would thus repre­ sent the increased price of the wool from twenty-five sheep and $36 that from the wool of fifty sheep, and at present values this addition would amount to about one third of its price. If upon its sale the farmer receives this or less tariff profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which in all the changes will adhere to it, until it reaches the colisumer, When manufactured into cloth and other goods and material for use, its cost is not only increased to the extent of the farmer's tariff profit, but a* futhure sum has been added for The Profit of the Manufacturer under the operation of the tariff laws. In. the meantime the day arrives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe him­ self and family for the winter. When he faces the tradesmen for that purpose he discovers that he is obliged not only to return in the way of increased prices, his tariff profit on the wool he sold, and which then perhaps lies before him in manufactured form, but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus in the end he is aroused to the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase as a result, of the tariff scheme, which, when he sold his wool seemed so profitable, an increase in price more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he received upon the wool he produced and sold. When the number of farmGrs engaged' in wool raising is compared with all the farmers in the country, and the small proportion, they bear to our population is considered when it is made apparent that, in the case of a large part of those who own. sheep, the benefit of the present tariff on wool is illusory and, above all, when it must be conceded that the increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a burden upon those with moderate means and the poor, the employed and unemployed, the sick and well, and the young, and old, a&d that it constitutes a tax which, with re­ lentless grasp, is fastened upon the cloth­ ing of every man, woman and child in the land, reasons are suggested why the removal or reduction of this duty should be included in a revision of our tariff laws. In speaking of the increased cost to the consumer of our home manufac­ tures, resulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same description, the fact is not overlooked that competi­ tion among our domestic producers sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of their products below the highest limit allowed by such duty. But it is notorious that this competition is Too Often Strangled by Combinations quite prevalent at this time, and fre­ quently called trusts, whicd have for tyeir object the refutation of the supply and price of commodities made and sold by members of the combination. The people can hardly hope for any considera­ tion in the operation of these selfish schemes. If. however, in the absence of such combinatiou, a healthy and free compe­ tition reduces the price of any dutiable article of home production below the limit which it might otherwise reach under our tariff laws, and if, with such reduced price, its manufacture continue to thrive, it is entirely evident that one tqinS has been discovered which should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxation. The necessity of combination to main­ tain the price of any commodity to the tariff point, furnishes proof that some one is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity, and that such prices are remunerative and lower prices produced by competition prove the same thing. Thus, where either of these conditions exist, a case would seem to be presented for an easy reduction of taxation. The considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws are in­ tended only to enforce an earnest recom­ mendation that the surplus revenues of the government be prevented by the re­ duction of our custom duties and, at th same time, to emphasize a suggestion that in accomplishing this purpose we may discharge a double duty to our peo­ ple by granting to them a measure relied from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most needed and from sources where it can be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor can the presentation made of such considerations be, with auy degree of fairness, regarded as evidence of un­ friendliness toward our manufacturing interests or of any Lack of Appreciation of Their Talue and importance. These interests con­ stitute a leading and most substantial element of our national greatness and furnish the proud proof of our country's progress. Hut if in the emergency that presses upon us our manufacturers are asked to surrender some­ thing for tho public good and avert disaster, their patriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of advant­ ages already afforded, should lead them to willing co-operation. No demand is made that they shall forego all the bene­ fits of governmental regard but they cannot fail to be admonished of their duty as well as their enlightened self-interest and safety,when they are reminded of the fact that financial panic and collapse, to which the present condition tends, affords no greater shelter or protection to our manufactures than to other important en­ terprises. Opportunity for safe, careful and deliberate reform is now offered and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated peo­ ple, heedless of those who have resisted timely and reasonable relief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping ratification of their wrongs. The difficulty attend­ ing a wise and fair revision of our tariff is not under estimated. It will require on the part of the congress great labor and care, and especially a broad and ra­ tional contemplation of the subject and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreasonable and re­ gardless of the welfare of the entire country. Under ottr present law more than 4,000 -articles are subject to duty. Many of these Do Not In Any Way Compete with our own manufactures aud many are hardly worth attention as subjects of revenue. A consiu arable reduction can be made in the aggregate by adding them to the free list. The taxation of luxuries presents no features of hardship but the necessaries of life, used and consumed by all the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home,should be greatly cheapened. The radical reduction of the duties im­ posed upon raw material used in manu­ factures or its free importation is of course an important factor in any effort to reduce the price of these necessaries it would not only relieve them from the increased cost caused by the tariff on such material, but the manufactured product being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff now laid upon such product as compensation to our manu­ facturers for the present price of raw material could be accordingly modified. Such reduction or free importation would serve beside to largely reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how such a change can have any injurious effect npon our manufacturers. On the contrary, it would appear to give them a better chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other countries, who cheap­ en their wares by free material. Thus our peo­ ple might have the opportunity of extending their sales beyond the limits of Home consump­ tion, saving them from the depression, inter­ ruption in business, and loss caused by a glut­ ted domestic market, and affording their em­ ployes more certain and steady labor, with its resulting quiet and contentment. The question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached in a spirit higlier than partisanship, and considered in the light of that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those intrusted with the weal of a confiding people. But the obligation to declared party policy and principle, is not wanting to urge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political parties now represented iu the government have, by repeated authoritative declarations. Condemned the Condition of Our Laws, which permit the collection from the people of unnecessary revenue, and have, in the most solemn manner, promised its correction: and neither as citizens or partisans are our coun­ trymen in a mood to condone the deliberate -violation of these pledges. Onr Progress to­ ward a arise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon the theories of protection sad free.trade. This savors too mnch of ban­ dying epMiets, It is a condition which con­ fronts us, siot a theory. Relief from this con­ dition mayinvolve a slight reduction of the advantages which we award our home produc­ tions, but t&e entire withdrawal of such ad­ vantages should not be contemplated. The question of free trade Is absolutely irrelevant, and persistent claim made in certasn quarters that all efforts to save the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so called free—raders, is mischievous and far re­ moved from any consideration for the public good. The simple and plain duty -which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the neeessary expenses of an economical operation of the government, and to restore to the busi­ ness of the country the money which we hold in the treasury through the perversion of gov­ ernmental powers. These things can and should be done with safety to all our indus­ tries, without danger to the opportunity for remuderative labor which our workingmen need, and with benefit to them and all our people by cheapening their means of subsist­ ence and increasing the measure of their com­ forts.

Every Manufacturer in the Two Cities a Member of the New Pool—-Chicago En­ gineers Not Expected to Striko—New York Hackmen Diuatlifinl. CHICAGO, Dec. 7.—A beer pool, to be known as the Chicago and Milwaukee Brewers' association, was organized here Monday. The membership is said to in­ clude every beer manufacturing firm in the two cities. Michael Keeley, of Chi­ cago, was elected president. Tho main object of the pool is stated to be to pre vent retailers from obtaining rates below the market price. For every barrel of beer sold to a retailer the brewer is to pay into the pool $3, which is considerable more than the entire profit on the sale. Nothing in regard to the division of pool funds was divulged. A feature of the pool contract is an agreement that neither city's brewers shall be permitted to com­ pete for trade in the other's home market.
