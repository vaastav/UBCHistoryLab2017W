A nation which endures factions ' domestic divisions, is etposed to disrepeot abroad, and one party, or both, la sure sooner or later to inroke foreign Interrentlon. Nations thus tempted to Interfere are not aiwajs aoieto resist the counsels of eseming eipedleney and ungenerous ambition, although measures adopted under such Influences nMm ftll to be unfortunate and uolnjurlous tj those adoptlrn tbem. Tbo dWajsl citizeuS b! ih United States who hare offered the ruin of oor country in reward Tor tbo aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, hare received less patronage and encouragement than the? proba bly expected. If it were juat to suppose, as the insurgents nave seemed to asaume. that foreien oatious in tmi case disregarding all moral, so cial and treat? obligations, would act snlelv and selfishly for the most tneedr restoration of commerce, including ipeciallr the acquisition of aoiiou, muse nations eppear as yet not to bare seen their way to tbelr object more direct or clearly thiough the destruoiiun than through the preservation of the Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign na tions are actuated by no higher principles than this, lam quite suie a sound argument could made to show them that tbey could reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion, than by giviog enoourage met.t to toe principal lever relied on for the ex citing of foreign nations to hoetilities against as already intimated in the embarrassment commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw from the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign eur domestic commerce. They can scarcely fail to perceive that the effort for disunion pro duces the existing difficulty, and that one strong aation promises more durable peace and a more txtepsive, valuable and reliable commerce than the same nation broken Into fragments k Ih not our purpose to review our diaousaions with foreign states, because whatever might be their wishes or dUpoeitious, the integrity of our country and the iWbility of our Government depends, not upon them, but upon the loyalty, fiatriotism, virtue and intelligence of the Amer cer! people. The.correipoodenceiiself, with the usual reser vations, is herewith submitted. I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced pru dence and liberality toward foreign powers, averting causes of irritation, and with firmness maintaining onr own rights and honor. Since, however, it is apparent that here, aa in every other atate, foreien dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that ade quale and ample measures be adopted for main taluicg the public defenses oo every side; while under this general recommendation provision defending our coast line readily occurs to the mind. I aloo In the same connection ask Lh attention of Congress to our great lakes .and rivers. It Is believed that some fortifications and de pots of aims and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements upon these, would be great importance to the National delonse and preservation. 1 ask attention to .the views the Secretary tf War, expressed in his re port upon tbe same general subieot. I deem It of imnoriacce that tbe loval regions aviist lennesseeana w estern worm Uaroli t; . rw, .... . . . a should be connected with Kentucky and nth luitniui parts oi tne union by railroad tnereiore recommend aa a necessary meas that Congress provide for the construction such a road as epeedily as possible. Ken tucky will no doubt co operate, and through her Legislature make tbe most judicious selection the line. The Northern torminus must con with some existing railroad, and whether route shall be from Lexington or Nichols vide to Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to Tennessee liuc.ia the direction of Knoxville, some different line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and the General Government co-ope-rating, tbe work oan be completed in a very short lime, and when done it will be not only vast present usefulness but also au available, permanent Improvement, worth its cost in all future. Some treaties, designed chiefly for tbe inter of commerce, and having no grave politi cal importance, have been negotiated, and will submitted to the Senate fur their considera Although we have failed to induce some the commercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration for' the rigor of maratime war, we have thus far icmoved all the obataoles from the of their humane reform, exoept such as of merely temporary or accidental occur rence. I invite your attention to the corresoondence between Her Britannic Majesty's Minister lc credited to this Government aud the Secretary State, relative to the detention of the British Perthshire in June last, by tbe United States steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of facts, and as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent aot not founded In strict right as sanctioned by publio law, I recommend an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel ber detention. I repeat the recommendation ol my predeces in nis annual message to Congress in De cember lost, lu regard to the disposition of tbe surplus which will probably remain alter satis fying the claims of American citizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the commis sioners under ttie act of tbe 30th of March, 1859. however, it should not be deemed advisable carry that recommendation into effeot, 1 would suggest, tbat authority be given for in vesting the principle over the surplus referred in good securities witn a view to tbe satia factiou of such other just claims of our citizens against Cbiua as are uot unlikely to arise here after in the oourse of our extensive trade with empire. , By the act of tbe bih of August last. Con gress authorised tbe President to instruct tbe commanders of suitable" vessels to defend tbum- eelvea against and to capture pirates, . This authority has beeu exercised iu a single iu : stanoe only. For the more effective promotion our extensive and valuable commerce in the eastern seas especially, it'eecme to me that it would alid be advisable to authorise the com manders of sailing vessels to re capture any prizes which pirates may make of United Stan vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts established by law ia eastern cuuntties adiudioate tbe cased, In the event that lb in should not be objected to by the local authuri . .", , .,'". ........

Th meodatioo by tho Seoretary for ao orgaoiaition of the Militia upon a unifoim basis, is a subject of vital importano to the future safety of the ojuntry, and it it commended to the serious at tention 01 L-ongres. A large addition tolbe regular army, lo connection with tha rlftmr, tbat has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar imoortancB ta hia recommendation for increatiog the corps of ca dets to the greatest capacity ol tbe military academy. By mere omission, I presume, Congress had failed to provide chaplains for tbe hospital oc oupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to my notice, and I was ioduced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which was pro perly addressed tj euch of the persons, and at toe notes respectively named and stated in a schedule, containing aloo tha form of th marked A, and herewith transmi Ud. Tbeet; gentlemen, I nuderstaod, entered upon the duties designated at tbe time respectively sttted In ua evueume, etna nave laDOred laltblully there in ever since. I therefore recommend tht th.-r be compensated at tbe same rate as chaplains Ik the army. I lurther auggeet that general pro vision be made for chaplains tj serve at hospi tals as well as with regiment. Tbe report ol the Secretart of the Naw n.A sents in detail tbe operations of that branch ol tne service, and tbe activity and energy which have characterized It administrAtion. and ihA results of measures to increase it efficiency nd power. Such have bceu the addition by construction and pup,haae, that it may lotos', be said that a navy has been created and broaigbt into service since our difficulties com-' menced. Besides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger tbau ever before ausiim- uieu unaer our nag, nave been put afljat and penormeu ueeas wnicn have increased our na val renown. I would invite special attention to the recom mendatlon of tbe Secretary of tbe Navy for a more pericct orgaoiittion ot the Navy, by In troducing additional grades in the service. Tbe present organization defective and unsatisfac tory, and the suggestions submitted by the De partment will.it is believed, if adopted. ovi ate the difficulties alluded to, promote harmony and Increase tbe efficiency of the Navy. There are three vacan leg 00 the Bench of the Supteme Court, two bi th darx.... r 1... tints Daniel and McLean, and one by the reeig nation of Justice Campbell. I have so f.r for borne makiag nominations to fill these vacan cies, fcr reason which I will nowatite.

If uniformity was at all intended, tbe system require that all the States shall be accommodated wi th 4rji)ni e ' Courts, attended by Supreme Judges, .while in fact, Wisconsin, Minueaota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida.

If useful, no State should be without them. If not useful, no Stat ahould have them. Let them be provided for all or abolished as to all. Three modifications occur to me here, which I think would be au improvement npon our pres ent system. Let the Supreme Courts bo of convenient number lo every event, then first let tbe whole couptry be divided into Circuit of convenient size, tbe Supreme Jadge to serve in a number of them oorrtspouding to their own number, aud independent Circuit Judge be pro- tur an mo rei; or secooaiy,. supreme Judges provided for all th oirouits; or thirdly, dispeuse with Circuit Courtj altogether, leaving . juuiuiai iuuuuuu wuony to us UltVlCt Courts and an iudepaodent Supreme Court.
