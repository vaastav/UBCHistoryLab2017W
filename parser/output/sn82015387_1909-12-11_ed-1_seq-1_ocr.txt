COVINGTON, ST TAMMANY PARISH, LA., SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1909. VOL. XXXVI NO 3 SYNOPSIS OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS TUESDAY As Published in the Time-I)em.ocrat. Country Declared To Be In a Prosperonts Condition. Subjects Reserved For Special Message. Opposition to the proposed imme diate congressional investigation of the sugar import scandals in the New York Custom House, and likewise to any further revision of the tariff at present; absence of any specfic recommendation of legislation to for bid the issuance of judicial injunctions without notice fi labor controversies and for the establishment of a system of postal savings banks, may be con sidered the most striking features of the first annual message of President Taft to Congress. The Nicaraguan question, conserva tion of the nation's natural resources, needed ammendments to the anti-trust and interstate commerce acts, and the contemplated revision of the Federal statutes governing the organization of the armed forces of the nation in time of war are all reserved for pos sible treatment later in special mes sages. In his message, which contains some 17,000 words, Mr. Taft reports the country to be "in a high state of pros perity," and he adds that "there is every reason to believe that we are on the eve of substantial business ex pansion, and we have just garned a harvest unexampled in the market value of ouj agricultural products. The President expresses entire con fidence that the duty imposed upon the executive of enforcing the maxi mum rates of the new tariff law against nations unduly discriminating against the United States will not pro voke any tariff war, and he favors no further tariff tinkering at least until the new tariff commission shall have completed its work of gathering infor mation as to the relative cost of pro ducing dutiable articles in this country and abroad. This task he expected will occupy two or three years. Projects recommended by the Presi dent in addition to those mentioned above, include: A ship subsidy to encourage Ameri can shipping; publicity of political contributions in elections of members of Congress; civil pensions; higher rate of postage on periodicals and magazines; a fund of $50,000 to aid in suppressing the "white slave" trade; a commission to evolve a plan to ex pedite legal procedure and "mitigate the law's delays;" construction of an artificial island and fortification in the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, two battleships and one repair ship for the navy, and the establishment of an ex tensive naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; a national bureau af health; statehood for New Mexico and Ari zona, and an appointive Governor and executive council for Alaska; civil control bf the Lighthouse Board and separation of the National Astronomi cal Observatory from naval control; celebration in 1913 of the semi-cen tennial of negro emancipation and re imbursement of the depositors of the Freedman's Savings and Trust Com pany; consolidations of the Bureaus of Manufactures and Statistics in the Department of Commerce and Labor; appropriation for the remodeling of the District of Columbia jail. Calling attention to the crisis in Central American affairs brought about by the summary execution in Nicaragua of two Americans, the President announces that this govern ment has terminated (tiplomatic rela tions with tne Zelayan administration. in Nicaragua, and intends to take such furtner steps as may be found most consistant with its dignity, its duty to American interests and its moral obligation to Central America and to civilization. In opposing any immediate investi gation of the New York Custom House scandal, the President takes the ground that snch investigation might, "by giving immunity and otherwise, prove an imbarrassment to secure conviction of the guilty parties." A proposal submitted by the Secre tary of the Treasury that the execu tive departments' deficit for the cur rent fiscal year-estimated at $73,075, 620-be met by the issuance of Pana ma bonds authorized by Congress, is approved by the President. Hle ex plains that in order to avoid a deficit, for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, estimates have been cut to the bone and instead of a deficit, there will be a surplds of $35,931,000, excludingpayments on the Panama Canal, which are expected to be taken care of by bonds. The President records with pleas ure the satisfactory' arrangement made for the arbitatration of the im portant North American fisheries issuE with Canada and the successful prose cution of the work of the commissions adjusting other boundary issues ane the lake fisheries. He urges an inter. national conference to devise measures for the protection of fur seals. HE is hopeful of a happy adjournment ol the Congo qucotiun, and expre~c~ hi. lesire to afford a larger measure of protection to the little negro State of Liberia. Satisfaction is expressed with the declararion by Japan and Russia in favor of the "open door" and appro priations are asked for the expenses of the Pan-American Congress to be I held in Buenos Ayres, for the partici pation in the Belgian exposition, both scheduled for next year.
