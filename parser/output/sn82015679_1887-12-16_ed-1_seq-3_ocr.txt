Marriaee' licenses were issued yesterday to Henry I CommiDgs and Mary E. GraTes Kob rt Martin and Ida Push. J. W. Millkan has been granted a permit to srect a frame residence on Michigan avenue, near Lynn street, to eost $1,200. A warrant has been issued on requisition of the Governor of Ohio for the arrest of C F. Smith, who is wanted for forgery in Champaign county. Abraham Harris, living in the rear of No. 240 North Illinois street, was arrested last evecin for abusing his wife. She desired to attend a nance, to which he objected, and the quarrel nded in his striking her with a chair. George Mitchell, who was thrown from Jacob Henry's saloon, on East Washington street, a few nights ago, with such violence that it was luppcsed his leg had been broken, seems to have misrepresented the nature of his injury. Ha was out on the street yesterday, and, in conse- 2uence. Henry's trial for assault has been in efinitely postponed. Further investigation develops that the oil tank explosion on Wednesday nicht was caused by Henry Smith, employed by the Barren wheel company, who. after running off nearly all the oil, raised his lantern to the tank so that he could see into I'm and the light communicating with accumulated gas caused the explosion. Smith was knocked a distance of several feet, but was not seriously injured. The tank be longed to the Sarven wheel company, and not to the rolling-mill company. SEEKING IDEAS IN THE CAPITOI. The commissioners of Cass county were exam ining the State-house furniture yesterday. They have a new court-house, and are after ideas in reeard to equipping it with the latest style of office conveniences in file boxes, desks and other essentials. THEY WANT A PLATFORM FOB PROTECTION. U, Z. Wiley, of Fowler, was in the city, last evening. He says that he is for the Republican presidential candidate whoever he may be, and that all of the party in his section of the State are of that mind. They want a platform for protection of American industries, for they re gard the President's tnessaee as defining his party's position indirectly favoring free trade. 

PETE M'CABTNEY WILL GO TO FLORIDA. Pete McCartney, the ex-counterfeiter, was in the city yesterday. His throat is affected by some malady, and his physicians recommended a change of climate. He is accordingly going to Florida as soon as he settles some of his busi ness affairs, so he says. The charge on which be was lecently taken from here to Illinois was not prosecuted. He was released on his own recognizance. - DETERMINED TO END HER LIFE. Minnie Hilton, the West Washington-street woman who attempted euk.de several days ago by swallowing carbolic acid, was found on the street unconscious, again, last night, and it Tras supposed she had made another attempt to take her life. She was removed to the station house, but soon recovered, without the assist ance of a physician. It is supposed the doss he took was too small, if she bad taken any. STOLE EVERYTHING THAT WASN'T NAILED. -" On Wednesday night thieves made a raid on Joseph Bundschak, a gardener living on East , Washington street, near the Belt railroad, and carried away nearly all the personal proper ty he had except his household furniture. His horse and wagon were taken from his stable, together with several dozen chickens, some tnr- - keys and various other kinds of property. His entire loss he estimates at between three and four hundred dollars. THEY MUST DRINK HOT WATER. With all its conveniences and luxurious equip ments the new State House has not a fancet that lets out good drinking water. During the winter it comes hot from the pipes, and when an official wants a drink he turns the faucet and allows the water to run for fifteen or twenty minutes, when he gets a tumblerful of some thing that might be a little more refreshing. The commissioners provided all other require ments for the officers' comforts, except coolers or cold water pipes. A BEE-LINK BBAEEMAN KILLED. William Van Meter, a brakeman on the Bee line railroad, living at Brightwood, was killed twenty-six miles east of. the city, last night, at 9 o'clock, and his remains were brought here on the 11 o'clock passenger train. The freight train on which he was employed broke in two and in the darkness he did not notice that the train was separated, and in attempting to run from one ear to another fell on the track and was run over. His body was badly mutilated and death occurred almost instantly, He was twenty seven years of age, and leaves a yonng wife and two children. His remains were taken in charge by Flanner & Buchanan. WORK OF THE THIEVES. The general store of Daniel O'Leary, on Hill side avenue, was raided Wednesday nieht by Dnrglars, who got about $200 worth of goods. Amone the things taken were a sack of coffee, several caddies of tobacco, a dozen bolts of mus lin and calico, and a number of boxes of cigars. No money was secured. The thieves must have had a wagon at hand, as the goods taken were too bulky to be carried away. A horse and delivery wagon belonging to Ernest Inner, the wholesale confectioner at No. 826 Virginia avenne, were stolen from in front of his place of business last evening at 5 o'clock. The wagon contained several boxes of candy. A BOLD ROBBERY BY FRCIT PEDDLERS. Two fruit peddlers, yesterday afternoon robbed Mrs. Magdalena Miller, a widow seventy years of age, residing at No. 3G6 North Noble. She went out to their wagon to purchase some ' apples, and after buying a peck, took out her pocket-book containing $20. and paid the bill in the exact change. After she had put the book back in her pocket she held up her apron to re ceive the apples, and while they were being poured into it one of te peddlers, who was a negro, slipped the money from her pocket and ran. She was unable to pursue the thief her self, and asked the other peddler to do so, but he refused and drove away hurriedly. DEATH OF MAJOR ELIHTJ GRIFFIN. Secretary of State Griffin has gone to Crown Point to attend the funeral of his father, Major Eliha Griffin, who died Wednesday afternoon on the train at Lockport, 111., while returning home from Hot Springs. For twenty, years Major Griffin had been almost helpless from paralysis affecting his lower limbs. About a month aeo the Secretary of State took him to Hot Springs, and for a while there were some signs of improvement; but during the past week bis condition became worse. Major Griffin was a paymaster in the volunteer artnv of 1861-18G5, when he contracted a malarial fever that led to his long affliction. He was at one time a leading lawyer in northern Indiana.

Lastnieht, between 10 and 11 o'clock, a farmer from near Greenfield, Hancock county, was robbed of $70 in one of the wine-rooms of Capt. Stewart's saloon at No. 23 North Illinois street. The money was taken by a disreputable woman with whom he spent the evening. The farmer same to the city on the evening train and in company with a friend from here went to the Stewart wine-rooms. There they fell in with two women. When the women left tbem at 11 I'elock the farmer discovered that his pocket eook bad been changed from one pocket to an other, and on examining it found seven ten foliar bills missing. The case was immediately ut into the hands of Sergeant John Lowe, but is neither of the two men nor the employes of ihe saloon knew the women it is not probable hat they will be caught. Members of the police force who know the farmer say he is one of the wealthiest around Greenfield, a man with family and is a church member. For that reason no amount of persuasion could induce them to reveal his name. After the first effort to find the woman who robbed him proved fruit less he informed the police that he did not wan any further effort made on account of the pub licity an arrest would give him. lie said he would return home on the train that leaves the city at 4 o'clock this morning. BETTER CARE FOR IMPOUNDED STOCK. The Metropolitan Police Commissioners yester day acted upon the charge that animals im prisoned in the Lincoln-avenue cattle pound were not afforded sufficient protection by order ing that a roof be built over a portion of the pound. The caipenters were put to work on the improvement at once, and it will be completed to-day. Patrolman Page, who is in charge of the pound, says there is no truth in the state ment that the stock in charce is not well fed. The city, he says, furnishes the best of food, and all the stock taken np is well fed. . The horse referred to in the complaint, he says, was taken np a week aeo only. It bad been turned oat to die by some one, and was in fact in a hor rible condition. It was not mistreated, though, after it had been put in the pound and was given plenty to eat. Mr. Page says the complaint of tne muaay condition of the pound ana tne lacK of shelter was well, founded, and that the defect snould have been remedied earlier. . REMONSTRANTS AGAINST A SALOON LICENSE. Nearly all the eitizens of May wood were ia the Commissioners' Court, yesterday, remon strating against the board granting a license to Carl Habich to sell liquor in that village. Among the remonstrants were D. T. Robinson, Henry Johnson, J. H. Porter, John Heard, W. F. Wright, Jesse Wrieht and others. Joseph Keating appeared for the remonstrants and Hen ry Spaan for Habich. At the September term of the board a Henry Rose applied for a license to sell in the same room which Habich is seek ing to occupy. The petition was fought and the license was refused. The remonstrants against Habich claim that it is still Rose who wants the license, and that be is seeking it by the use of Habich's name. Habich is the head bottler at Maus's brewery and that fact, the res idents of May wood think, strengthens their al legation. Habich testifies that he expected to run the saloon. himself, and had no connection witn Rose, but the people do not believe it. All the evidence was heard, and the commissioners took their decision under advisement until to morrow. Items from the Courts. A YOUNG LADY'S SUIT FOR DAMAGES. James M. Clennehan has been made the de fendant in a libel suit brought by Miss Lizzie Smith.

The Northwestern Lake Ice Company has brought suit against the Cincinnati, Indianapo lis, St. Louis & Chicago Railway Company for $5,0u0 damages on account of the burning of a large ice-house, north of the city, several months ago. The ice-house was situated near the rail road, and it is alleged that the railroad company at that time used an old. worn-out locomotive ior awiicning purposes, wnion, on account oi its worn-out condition, emitted a great volume of sparks of fire. The ice-house, it was claimed, was set on fire by sparks from that engine, and, with a large stock of ice, was totally destroyed. CLAIMS THAT HE ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE, jonn iucJNamara is on trial oeiore a jury in the Criminal Court for assault and battery with intent to kilL On the 7th of last May there was a general fight amone several young men on South West street, in which McXamara very se riously cut Thomas Boylan. McXamara, at the time, was in the employ of the street-railway company, and the day after left the city and went to Cleveland, where be was afterward arrested by Sheriff King.

That clever stretch of absurdities, "Crazy Patch," was presented at English's Opera-house last night, with a large audience to appreciate it, as shown in repeated laughter and applause. Miss Kate Castleton's winning songs and dances, together with her pleasing extravagances as the bashful boarding-school maiden, were as heartily-received as they were in ber past appearance here. The cast presented some new faces in the principal characters, but the farce in its more catchy features suffered nothing from the change. Eddie Foy's eccentricities were en joyed greatly, particularly his song of the Gladi ator and imitations of John Raymond. "Crazy Patch" will be repeated to-night, and at the two peformances to morrow. HON. T. E. NELSON'S LECTURE ON MEXICO. Hon. Thomas H.

TESTED A-SECOND TIME. The Indianapolis Company Snccessfnlly Tries the Heaviest Pressure on Its Pipe Line. The Indianapolis company's line, as far as completed, was tested, again, yesterday, under the heaviest pressure, the joints being found se cure and the whole length, of pipe in first-class condition. When the company reaches the city limits it will have an enormous supply of gas to Utilize, and it is the rpurpose to lighten ia the new year with an illumination from a dozen or more stand-pipes. To effect this the flow from the heaviest wells, will be turned into the mains trader the highest pres sure it can bear. Each joint. of pipe before it came out of the National Tube works was tested under 400 pounds, about -seventy pounds more than the rock pressure of the Noblesville wells, hence this great stream of gas will come down to this city with at least two hundred and fifty pounds behind it. From recent evidences it appears that the Standard gushers which ex cited so much attention a few months ago, were from comparatively small flow?; as nearly all of the newer wells exceed them two-fold in their daily output of gas. Tbe Indianapolis company thought it had reached the limit of capacity with the Horlock well, which was described as a terror.- but another came in yesterday that goes . -beyond, it. On the Craig farm, yesterday morning, the drill found oil which was thrown out in large quanti ties. It is said, though, that there' is not enough Jo indicate that oil in paying quantities underlies that portion of the Noblesville dis trict. It is presumed that as at Greenfield a pocket was reached which will be readily ex hausted. . "There is oil in Hamilton county," eaia one wno naB given me region a ciose stuay, .."but it lies in a field that has not yet been de veloped. ' It may be discovered soon, but the Indianapolis company's wells are not contiguous to it." - The trust will not buy oras is probable, make any deal whatever with the Broad Ripple com pany. Several propositions from the latter company have been considered, but the trust directors think that outside of a direct purchase A Union of tbe two interests would be impracti cable,; One proposition contemplated the sale of gas to the trust at the city limits, but the directors of that company say they are not ready to adopt a limited system, of. pipes which would be neceesary in order to supply consum ers at once. They want their system adopted as a whole in all its details, before they supply gas, as taking up a small territory now might involve an expensive change in the future. The Brond Hippie people say they will carry out their plan's as they now are, and enlarge their territory for consumers as rapidly as their supply increas?s. They have nine wells under contract, and these they think, with the five now flowing, will enable them to accommodate the territory, which will probably be from Mississippi street on the west to Pennsylvania on the east, and from the northern limits to Washington street. Private residences alpng the line outside of the city are bing fitted with pipe, and this evening Kissel's place will bathe first near the city to have gas burning for heat ing and cooking purposes. The company's offi cers say they can obtain all the customers they cau suppiy ior soma nine so come. , . Appropriate O. A. IS.- Souvenirs. ST. Louis. Dec 15.

OBITUARY. Unexpected Death of Hod. Joseph It. Bod well, Governor of Malue. Hallowelu Me., Dec. 13. Gov. Joseph R. Bodvell died this morning. His death was caused, by congestion of the Inngs, caused from ex posure and overwork. - Death was very sadden and unexpected, as it was believed that he waa on the road to speedy recovery. He had slept well during the. eight. , Shortly after 5 o'clock this morning he awoke and asked his nephew to -put him in his chair. - It was no sooner done.-1 than he expired. He died without a struggle. 3 passing away peacefully. His death was prob-" ably caused bv paralysis of the beart. '' S. S. Marble, President of the Senate, will go to Augusta at once and enter noon bis o facial duties as chief magistrate of the State. j Joseph R. Bodwell was born June 18, 181S, in Metbuen, Mass. He was scarcely old enough to attend school when his father lost his property and the family was reduced almost to want. At eight years he was thrown almost upon his own resources. After attempting various projects, he bound himself out to a relative, Patrick Fleming, with whom he remained on a farm till 1834 He then hired out as a farm-hand at $6 a month and board. He saved every cent except what he spent for a few clothes and some books, which he eagerly studied evenings. He next began to learn the shoemaker's trade, and was able to save most of his earnings. Ia 1840 be, with his father, purchased a farm in West Methuen, and nntil 1S48 gave -his atten tion' to farming, especially stock-raising. About this time improvements of the water power at Lawrence were begun, and young Bod well hauled stone from Pelbam. N. H.. to build a dam across the Merrimae, thus utilizing his farm stock, to good advantage. While thus engaged he gained an insight into tbe granite business, and after studying it thoroughly, formed a partnership with Moses Webster and bought tbe quarry at Fox Island, Me. His vent ure was successful. Business increased. He formed a stock company and purchased a fine quarry at Hallowell and others at Vinal Haven, Jonesboro and tbe . Blue Hill. Ha also became interested in various corporations, among them the Orono Water Power Company on the Penobscot river. He also carried on stock rais ing on a large seale, his farm being tbe largest in the State. From such a life he was chosen against bis wishes to become Governor of Maine, and he was equally successful as an executive. He was elected in 1886. He was known all over the State as "Honest Joe Bod weiL" His radical stand on the prohibition question and his per sistent enforcement of the prohibitory law have made him very prominent in the controversies now being held. Several test eases pending in the courts demanded his constant attention. He had served as Mayor of Hallowell, member of the Legislature, and delegate to the Repub lican National convention of 18S0.
