So far the Government has paid Eads $4, 550,000. . ' The Taxing-District Government is doing a great deal in the way of compelling house and lot owners to repair their sidewalks, but it is not pushing them fast enough. On Poplar and Union streets there are yet a great many break-neck holes, and on the south aide of Court Square, from the Tennes see Club to the corner of Second, and on the corner of Second and Court in front of the Board of Health office, it will find a very disgraceful condition of sidewalk, demand ing immediate remedy. The reports of deaths for November show a gratifying decrease in the Dumber as com pared with the same month in the three pre vious years. The total was ninety-one whites, thirty-six, and colored fifty-five. For the corresponding month in 1873 the deaths were 143 white, ninety-seven; colored, forty-six. In 1379 theyVere ninety-four whites, fifty six; colored, thirty-eight, and in 1880 they were 100 whites, fifty-two; colored, forty eight. Since November, 1S80 our population has increased 6000, and since the aamt month of 1873 fully 13.000. Yesterday's session of the Legislature was without special interest, the question of in crease in representation being the only one discussed. The indications are that the number of representatives will be increased. The Democratic caucus had it under discns ion yesterday, but did not reach a conclu sion. It is still under consideration. A mo tion by Representative Thompson to suspend the rules to take up a motion declaring sn increase of representatives an additional burden on the people waa voted down in the House. The American Missionary Association, which has done so much for the colored peo ple since the war, now has a well-appointed college in every Southern State, save Florida and Arkansas.

POI.MIINH THE AIR. The faction which bo'ted the last State IVmocralic Convention, and thereby secured the election of Hawkins, is responsible for all toe woes brought npon the people of Tennessee by the passage of the 100-3 bill. It must be confessed that the bolters had many causes to provoke them to the course ther tinwieely adopted. The Appeal con demned the action of the majority in the severest terms. But, to prevent the very re sults that followed, and in the interest ef the taxpsying people, it pleaded for unity, and day titer day, in rolUSm after column, it sbewed that ' the elec tion of Wright would secure a satisfac t ry settlement of the State debt, and that the triumph of Hawkins would lasten upon the people every dollar which the bondhold ers claimed as due them. But the bolters "would be dupes, and ye are." The Appeal denounced the passage i f the 100-3 bill in the severest terms, regarding it as the pro duction of bribery and corruption and the coupon feature as an infamy r.f unparalleled turpitude. At first the people were amazed at the appalling iniquity, but they were not speechless, for there was an almost universal feeling of indignation ex pressed against the representatives Who had le'.rayed them. They were told by the first lawyers of the State, and even by men opposed to the 100 3 bill, that it was fastened upon them, and that the laws of the country afforded neither immediate nor re mote relief. Tho people were about to yield a sullen and reluctant acquiescence to an outrage they were told could not be remedied, when the possible means of escape were discovered. The ICO 3 bill, in all its uionsiro.ity, was brought before the Su preme Court of the State, composed of the ablest an 1 purest men of the State, elected by the people themselves, and to this tri bunal the question should have been ad journed. If the court pronounces the 100 3 bill unconstitutional, then the adjustment qf the State debt will become an issue in fu ture elections, but if it should suxtain the legality and constitutionality of the bill, tlieu what are you going to do about it? We are a law-abiding people, and every good citizen respects the beheiU of the courts orginiz?d for their protection. So long as the 100 3 bill ia before the courts it cannot be made a quertion in a political canvass before the people, and any discus sion of it M as unprofitable as pounding the air. If the Democratic party of Tennessee had not partaken of the insane root it would harmonize on this question- agree to abide the decision of the Supreme Court and thus prevent the transfer of the State to the Republican party, which, composed mostly of non-taxpayers, cares nothing for the burdens fas tened npon the taxpaying people. It makes no difference in a State convention what peculiar views Democrats may entertain as to the 100-3 bill, as that question will be decided by the courts. Entertaining these . views, the Appeal has avoided the disccs ' sion of a question which is not an issue be fore the eople not a question for them to decide at the ballot-box, but for the Supreme Court of the State. We have been furnished with enough matter discussing the 100 3 bill to make several pages in the Appeal. But, regarding such a discussion aa a waste of space which should be given to more valua ble matter, we cannot afford to encumber our columns with a wrangle which would be as much out of place as a discussion of the reconstruction acts. But the bolters, whose disaffection to the regular organized Demo cratic party in the liist election fastened upon the people the 100-3 bill, are swinging theii arms wildly and howling against the fruits of their folly, aa if the people were called upon to decide the validity aud con stitutionality of the 100-3 bill, instead of the Supreme Court, Verily, they are bnsy in pounding the air. They meet, in grand debate and alternately hold each other's clothes while the pounding is going on by ome enraged comrade. When they unloosen their jaws and lift up their chins together, they are indeed noisy, and noisy about what? ' Why, in discussing a question which ia to be decided, not by the people, but by the Supreme Court of the State. The beating of Chinese gongs will strike no terror to the Supreme Court judges. Indeed, it will inspire their contempt and scorn. The people are unquestionably op posed to the 100 3 bill but the Democratic party of Tennessee, with its forty thousand majority, should adjust itself to the sit uation. It gains nothiDg by re-electing Hawkins then why not unite and maintain the parly organization? This cannot be done by criminations and recriminations about a question which is to be decided by the Su preme Court. As some deaf deacon, wrest ling vainly with the hymn, comes lumber ing along lagging on a verse behind the choir, and stands up alone, howling out the closing line-1, though the organ has. ceased and the ' congregation has been - -dismissed, so do these agitat or Continue t diucuss n question after it has been r ferrcd to the courts, whose de cision will make the 100-3 bill an irrepealable law or declare it unconstitutional and void, which latttr decision would reopen the State debt question and its discussion would be ap propriate and proper. There is a story told of a deaf lady, who, having pitched her voice is conversation with a friend during the playing of the orchestra, startled the whole theater at a sudden stop of the music, with the loud, shrill remark: "We fry ours in butter." She had pitched her voice to run along with the orchestra, and when the music stopped it kept on, standing out from the auddeu silence like a signal gun in a sleeping camp of soldiers. These men ought to be told that the question they are fighting and pommeling so desperately is before the Supreme Court, and any discussion now ia as ridiculous as the deaf deacon singing or the proclamation of the deaf lady as to how she served her oysters. Ther bondholders and their purchased tools who fastened upon the people the 100 3 bill are fighting with the energy pf dep.iir. If the Supreme Court of Tennessee should declare the bill uncon stitutional and void, the State debt question will be reopjned, and fiagraut, downright re pudiation will be imminent, as the ont rnge,which ' tho lat Legislature attempt ed to fasten npon the people has made many rcpudiatorsfer as. Moreover the result of the elections in Virginia haa given a national respectability to readjust ment, the scaling and repudiation of State debU. The Republican Administration at Washington threw its power against those who would have Virginia and all the Southern States pay in full their obligations. Virginia has been transferred to the Republican party by the aid of the Republican Adminis tration mi a platform which makes State credit a mockery and a farce, and hone t men now have no incentive to contend for that which the Republicans declare is not worth preserving.

GENERAL SIIEKMAX TliaukCd by Gnitean for the Protection Extended to Him on the Dy of - the Assassination. Scovil'.e Claims th.t President Arthur's Testimony is Absolutely Essen tial to the Defense. Washesgton, December 7. The Crim inal Court was densely crowded this morn ing. Among the audience were General Sherman and the Rev. DeWitt Talmage. To day the prosecution commence in rebuttal to demolish the theory of insanity as set up by the defense. In doing this they will retra verse the ground gone over by the defense from the start The prosecution will thor oughly ventilate Guiteau's past life and habits, beginning with his early life in Free nort. and concluding: with a vast amount of the most expert testimony obtainable in the country. As soon a- the court v formally opened Guiteau ddrered the court, in rather impe rious tones, as follows: "May it please your honor, the American people do not desire that this case shall be tried again, and I do not desire it, I say, with the utmost respect to this court and the jury and my counsel, Mr. Scoville, that I am not satisfied with the political situation as developed here in this case. That ii the gist of the alleged offense. The President of the United States would never have been shot if it had not been for the political situation which existed last May and June, and I say I have the right, as a matter of law, appearing as my own counsel, to ask your honor that General Grant, Senators Cockling and Piatt and President Arthur, and tbat kind of men, who were so down npon Garfield that they would not speak to him on the street, and would not go to the White House, shall be put on the stand. I have a right to show my personal relation to these gentlemtn; that I was cordially received by them, and that I wes well dressed and well fed at the Fifth Ave nue Hotel. 1 want to show my personal re lations to those men. I do not want to ex cept to jour honor's luliug, but I bhall bs obliged to do so, and I have no doubt the court in banc will give me a new trial." Judge Cox Your exception has been noted. Mr. Scoville then called up the subject of president Arthur's testimony, and sai1 he had not yet receive.' any response to his interrogatories; that the President's testimony was absolutely essen tial to the defense. Guiteau interrupted him, excitedly, with ''I don't think it at all necessary for General Arthur to be here." To Seville: "I don't care what yon want; I'm doing this myself. I ask it as a personal favor that he sbau't be dragged into court, I think a good deal of General Arthur; he is President of the United States, and I don't think he should be bothered with thia matter;" and striking his desk violently, he added, "he is President of the United states, and I made him so, and I think that 1 should have something to say ;n thia matter." It was arra nged between connsel that the nswers should be put in evi- J President's answers should be p de nee at any stage of the trial, and Scoville called 

GENERAL tT. T. SnEBMAH. The witness simply recited the orders he had issued for the inspection of troops at the time of the assassination. He ideutifie-i a letter written by Guiteau, and said he sus pected at the time there might be a conspir acy, but afterward concluded tbat the shott ing was the act of one man. As he left the stand Guiteau said, "I thank you, General, for having ordered out those troops that day. If it hadn't been for yon I shouldn't be here to day. I owe my life to H e protec tion whit h yon and General Crocker gave me during that period when a mob spirit was rite." EDWARD P. BARTON, a lawyer, A. T. Green, and G.W.Tandy, all of Freeport, Illinois, testified they knew the Guiteau family, and considered them all sane. DR. B. P. BUCKLEY, of Freeport, testified that he was L. W. Gui teau's family physician; never saw any in dications of the slightest mental derange ment, nor in ,bram Guit"an. Corkhill (aide but quite audibly Nor anv one else. Scoville Are yon testifying? Corkhill I only wish I could. Scoville Well, go on the stand and tes tify, but don't Bit there and talk to the jury. Witness wis asked if he ever heard L. W. Guiteau say he could heal disease by prayer. Guitean (excitedly) He only talked that in his family. He didn't run around the streets to preach it, like an idiot or a jack-a-s; he had too much sense fur that. Witness had never heard any such claim on the part of L. W. Guiteau. He waa asked if he knew Dr. North was the must positive witness introduced by the defense, and by his showing the entire Gui teau family were more or less insnn-. Witness knew the prisoner in Freeport, Illinois. Guiteau The fact of the matter is, my father used money, which should have sent me to college, in supporting that Dr. North and his family on my father's farm at Free port. Corkhill That's just my opinion of Dr. North. Pending the cross-examination, John W. Guiteau, brother of the prisoner, aiose and protested against the manner in which the name of his half-sister, Flora W. Guiteau, had been mentioned. He desired that the witness should state exactly the infirmity under which she suffered. Colonel CorKhiil thought the r qui st a most proper one. He had received a letter from tlie young lady, who had lived twenty four years unmarried and against whom no word of reproach had ever been uttered. She had felt very keenly the intimation that had been made on the stand I y the defense that she had been to St. Lonis for treatment in anticipation of her becoming insane. Witness said the lady in question suffered from an affection of one of her eys, and was sent to St. Louis for treatment of the eye. Guiteau whispered to his brother: "What do you want to make such a fuss about that for?" Then, aloud: "lam sorry my half sisUr's name was dragged in here. She is a very nice person, so far as I know, and 1 send her greeting." Mrs. Scoville, sitting on the other side of J. W. Guiteau, was greatly excited, and angrily accused her brother of trying to in jure their case. MR. ATKINS, of the Freeport JtrpMican, confirm) d the testimony of the previous witnesses aa lo the the sanity of the various members of the Guiteau family. WitBess waa asked if he knew Dr. North, and replied: "Yes; I knew him as a Metho dist minister. I know the causes of his dis missal." Corkhill Well, what were the causes? Witness He was dismissed for lascivious conduct. On the conclusion of the examination of this witness a recess was taken. Just betore recess some one in the audi ence made a request of Guiteau for his auto graph. Guiteau wrote it with a tloiiri-h, aud, as he tore off the slip, said: "I want to call attention to this autograph business. A great many people want my autograph, and I give it to them; but there is no vanity in me, or egotism. I notice the newspapers are taking it up again. There's co.hing in it at all." After iHm. J. Cochran, a lawyer who had resided in Freeport since 1S"8, Ustiti -d that he never saw r.ny indications of insauity in any mem ber of the Guitean family. Witness was about to leave the stand, when Guiteau shouted to him, "II Id on, don't yon know his referring to the prison er's father active support of the Oneida Community? haven't you heard him dic iss frco-loveism, and all thai? don't you know he was the laughing stock of all Freeport for twenty-rve years tor his crana idi"'u.' Scoville, whispering to Guitean, tiied to restrain him, but he shouted at him: "Y'ou keep quiet; I'm doing this, nnd don't you know enough to keep still when I am qius tioning a wilnessV" Then, with a wave of his hand, "Mr. Witness, go on." The witness was told that he might an swer, and Yeplied: "I know juM the reverse to be the case." Guiteau Well, that was a fact, anyway. We don't want ny more of this kind of evi dence. These people don't know anything about my father's social lite and character. There is no controversy about his business character. GEORGE W. OYLFR, Justice of the Peace, had lived in FreeKrt since 1848, and never saw indications ot in sanity in any of the Guiteau family. Witness waa asked if he knew a man by the name of Amerling, who had testified for the defense. Mr. Scoville protested against the unfair ness of the prosecuting attorney in makiug a covert attack on Amerling, as he had done in the examination of several witnesses. Guiteau shouted: "It only shows the bad breeding of the man." ANSON B. BABCOOK, a farmer, had known L. W. Guiteau since 1840; never .saw any indication of insanity in him; never regarded any of the family of unsound mind. DAVID R. SUTHERLAND knew L. W. Guiteau for thirty -six years, and never saw anything to indicate thit he was of unsound mind in any way or in ar.y de gree; from his knowltdge of and acquaint ance with the members of the Goiteau fam ily, including the prisoner, witmss had never suspected that there was any insanity in the family. Gnileau had for some minutes been read ing the President's Message, and suddenly interrupted the court to express his opinion on the document. "I'm -glad," said he, "President Arthur has given those miserable Mormons such a slap. I hoe he will keep at them. It's a gooJ message; has got the right ring in it. Arthur is doing well, and he is giving us the best administration we have ever had." 

HORACE TARBOX. of Freeport, was well acquainted with L. W. Guiteau; he had as good a head on him aa any man in the State, and (after a slight pause) he wae the third smartest man in the oountv. . "Who was first?" qnickly asked Guitean. "Mr. Sweet," replied the witness. Guiteau Who was second? "Mr. Turner," was the reply. "Well," said Guiteau, with a broad smila of satisfaction, "us they hare both been dead a great many years, my father was nhcad." Guiteau was about to interject another little speech, when Scoville endeavored to stop him, and was told: "Don't be punching me under the table, please, when I want to speak;" and, after a short pause, "I tell you what it is, Scoville, you have got to abandon yeur theorv, that's all there is about that. He was a "smart man, and everybody knew it) only he was badly cracked ou jeligion." Adjourned. The fcxperl. The fact that but a few of the twenty or thirty experts summoned for the defendant gave their testimony excites some remark, and it is said that nearly all r.f them came to the conclusion that they could do Guiteau no good by their testimony. A few experts had a coi.ference with Guiteau Monday, but none of them appeared yesterday on the witness-stand. The prisoner stated that the ex perts requested him to take some medicine before making au examination, but he de clined. They talked with him au hour and a half, and examined his eyes, feet and pulse, aud left, The ErTert of wulieu' Teatimoity on ttte KKperts.

The Doctor was formerly Superinten dent of the In liana II ispital for the Insane, and is widfly known among the medical fra ternity. He says: "Guiteau is the the legiti mate result of birth and education, and not a mnnstro"ity of disease.

FLIPPER'S STOttY Of His Flop from Honesty and Integrity to Vice and Crime An Exceed ingly Thin Statement, aud One that Will Hardly Wash With the Court Now Trjloj His Case. San Antonio, December 7. At the open ing of court yesterday morning Lieutenant Flipper made the following statement in substance, in reference to his present diffi culty: "The first charge and its specifications in this case I declare to you, in the most sol emn and the most positive manner possible, that 1 am perfectly innocent of in every way, shape and form; Uiat I have never, by myself or by another, appropriated, con verted or applied to my own use a single dollar or enny of Government money, or permitted it to be done, or authorized any meddling with it whatever. Of course I am not guilty. The funds for which I was re sponsible I kept in my quarters in my trunk, because I felt more secure to have them in my own cu-tody. On May 21 I received a telegram from General Smalt not to transfer any funds, as he intended being absent from San Antonio. Thia, I construed, meant ev erything pertaining to the funds, as I was not informed that someone would be leftto attend to routine hilsir.cts there during his absence. I submitted my funds regularly to the com manding officer for inspection; "did not make a statement, in consequence of the telegram of May 21; thought it unnecessary, and dis continued it for June; the accumulated funds, after Verification, we put in the trunk in total, and they were not examined until Jnlv 8ih, when referred to the post commander lor cu-tomary inspection, and then discov ered diccrepency of il540; did not know what to do.bul chose to put iu my own check for the amount, intending to deoosit inv imt- sonal check in bank before required to remit the check; expected my company in from the field July 10th; knew they had two months pay in checks; thought 1 could get what I wanted; the post tra.ler casaed them bt-fore I could; I then relied on gelling money from the publisher of my book, who had promised it; I was disappointed again; believed the shortage of $1440 was caused by commissary bills due me for stores sold the men aud 1 iiiudre.-sts on personal account; was caused no uneasiness, as I thought when the money should be paid I could d-posit to meet the cluck, if not able to meet it with my personal tunus; when leaving my quar ters August 13th, I believed, and do believe, all the funds I waa n sponsible for were in my trunk except this check; when I learned otherwise I was perfectly astounded ; I was entirely ignorant of where it was; I was not n sponsible, except to make good, wkich I have done; my servant lived with a laun- i i urcss; uas no place lo Keep ner doming; '.

SEWS AXI VIEWS. National bank circulation has increased $1.,655,327 since Decemlier 1, 18S0. This, too, in spite of the fact that the banks with drew, iu their prosperous endeavor to "bull doze" Congress, about $18,000,000, not all of which has since got back to circulation. An enthusiastic manufacturer of Taunton, Massachusetts, predicts that within fifty vears there will lie a line ot factorits from Taunton to Fall Kiver, and 200,000 people in the river valley. He says th facilities which the river offers for cheap coal and cot ton freight warrant the prediction. A New York weekly that strikes the Ilmtr regularly, says: "Mining matters look dull enough just at present; but afterthe holidays some new Mexican properties will be put UfHn the market, in which will be a great deal of money far those vho get in first and get out first." The Baltimore American admires the pea green Wilton carpet just put down on the flmr of the Representatives' hall.

A whip of sole leather, two feet long, burned in the center to make it hard, oiled at the extremities to make it pliable, and mounted on a hickory handle a f t end a half long, is the exquisite instrument with which au officer of the Wisconsin Industrial School for Boys is said to have been iu the habit of enforcing order and punishing offen ses auion the lads uuder his charge. Hig faverite plan, according lo the accounts given by the pupils, was lo strip off a boy's outer clothing, tie him over a chair back, and lay on the lash until the blood flowed profusely. The charges have been denied bv the officer. and a closa examination into the matter i li st it u led. A Vienna physician has put the electric light to a very wonderful purpose, lie uses it-to illuminate the in-ide of a man. We sec it slated that the instrument he uses for the purpose is a sort of stomach-pump with an illuminating attachment. It is thrust down the patient's throat into his stomach and then lighted, the lixht being furnished by au incandescent platina coil connected with a conduc'or. Every part of the stom a h is brought into plain view by the in tense light which shines through the wal s of lhe biy. To prevent the examination beii'g disturbed by coughing, the patient is placed under the influence of morphine for the lew minutes required in an examination. An association has been formed in Xew York, ef which the Hon.

Oue of lhe speakers at a meeting of the sssoeiatiou Saturday claimed that iu twenty-rive years the Harlem river will bs center iif the city, and will probably be lined with warehouses. Furthermore, the speaker said land all around the new park would he immensely increased iu value, as it has around Central Park, but it is not proposed, as the park is to be of an entirely rural char acter, to assess adjoining property for the purchase of the laud or the cost of improve- nirnt. If it be objected that the expense will be too great, then it is answered that the eame objection was urged against the crea tion of Central Park. Manufacturers who are striving to increase the number of schools in this country where persons may be educated for industrial pur suits will hear with interest of the work of the English Royal Commission on Technical Education. That commission is now busy in Paris visiting the higher, the secondary and the primary schools in which manual and technical instruction is imparted. It U the in tention of the commissioners also to inquire Into the state of instruction in the districts in France in which cotton, woolen and silk manufactures are carried on, with the object of obtaining an insight into methods of edu cation that may be available for the same purpose in the corresponding manufacturing districts in England. Little is heard of the project for boring a tunnel under the English Channel from England to France, but it appears tbat the work is actually in progress.

It ia be lieved if the required $100,000,000 can be raised the work might be finished in a com paratively short time. One estimate is that the tunnel could be made fit for traffic in fbur years. About two months were re cently consumed in moving from the Abbot's Cliff heading to the Shakespeare Cliff the machinery in use there.

ABOUT WOMEN. Men speak of what they know; women, of what pleases them. Rcmaik of a person recently arrested on complaint of a woman: "This in an outrage. I was never in Plymouth Church in my life." The hight of politeness is passing round upon the opposite side of a lady, while walk ing with her, in order not to step on her shadow. A beaiitifnl smile is to the female counte nance what the sunbeam is to the landscape; it embellishes an inferior face and redeems an ugly one. The highest mark of esteem a young woman can give to a man is to ask his friend ship, and the most signal proof of her indif ference is to offer him hers. He smiled; I wot not who npon; Perhaps behind his nape. He saw his tsilor. quickly gone, And smiled at his escape. On her dtath-bed at Santa Barbara, Cali fornia, twenty years ago, Mrs. Blancho gave $26,000 in trust to her most intimate friend, Mrs. Del Vnlle, charging her solemnly to keep its psession a secret until Marie Blan cho, then a baby, became twebty-one, Mrs. Blancho had no faith in banks or wills, and died satisfied that her daughter would re ceive the treasure, which is in the form of diamonds.

OKLAHOMA. Payne's Plans and Purposes Regarded as Entirely Feasible by Those M ho Know the Territory. A Pen Portrait of Him The Law of the Land is with Him Railroads Anx ious to Enter the Territory. Wichita (Kansas) Letter to the Kansas City Tunes. Recent dispatches from the Kansas border and the Texas country, abutting the Indian Territory, and from Gainesville, Texas, where Captain Payne is collecting the mem bers of bis colony, has awakened a new in terest in Oklahoma. Here in Sedgwick county, where the colony has 300 members, composed of some of our best business men and most reliable farmers, news from Payne and anything bearing on Oklahoma is read with eagerness. The granting of the right of way through the Territory to power ful railway corporations, the contemplated early building of these lines, was regarded as a good omen by all the friends of Okla homa, and as the entering wedge to the early opening of the finest agricultural, mineral and grazing lands west of the Mis souri river to the settlement of the whites. Here Captain Payne is respected, and the early settlement of Oklahoma is regarded as an entirely feasible and wise scheme. Captain Dave Payne, the leader of the enterprise, is a man of experience and education, of busi ness capacity a::d has an acquaintance bounded only by State lines. He is thor oughly conversant with Indian ways and skilled in woodcr.ift, and is the peer of any marksman on the border, in skill and daring, and a giant iu stature and strength. This is a pen picture of Captain Dave Payne, who for years has given to this enterprise his en tire time and best ctlbrts. During the war the Choctaw, Creek, Seminole and Chickasaw Indian trib.-s went into the rebellion to de stroy the Union. In the months of April and July, 1866, the Government of he United States treated with thes3 Indian tribes. In those treaties the Government, in timating that it desired lands for the ireed men and the wild tribes on the plains, pur chased for that purpose what are now known as the Oklahoma lands in the In dian Territory, and paid therefor from fifteen to sixty cents per acre, and then and thereby extinguished the Indian title. There are now no freed men, all being alien citizens of the United States, and white and black are the same under the law. Since the treaties by the Government and said tribes, the Congress of the United States, acting upon the protest of the States of Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas and Texas, in connection with the civilized and half-civilized tribes residing in the Territory, has con stantly legislated against the introduction and settlement of said wild Indians on the Oklahoma lands. These lands are not within any reservation by proclamation, law or treaty, and are therefore Government lands, subject to pre-emption and homestead under the act of Congress of September, 1841, and the homestead laws of 18i2. In the month of March, 1879, the Oklahoma colony and Oklahoma Town company were formed in this city, with Captain David Payne as Pres ident of both companies. In June, 1880, Captain Payne, with several companions, at tempted a settlement on the Oklahoma lands, having ia the meantime surveyed and laid out the citv of Oklahoma, but was captured or e uusu mates troops, ana rsyne WKU nve companions was taken to Fort Smith, Ar kansas, and there confined by the United States authorities for the period of ' thirty dys, and afterward, without any trial or punishment, released. In the fall of the same year Captain Payne made a second entry into the ceded lands, but was again ejected therefrom by L'nited States troops and confined for twenty six days at Fort Smith. At this time Payne was indicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. The indictment was found under section 2148 of the general statutes of the United States, which are as follows: "If any person who has been removed from the Indian country shall thereafter -at any time return or be found within the Indian eountrv he shall be liable to a penalty of ?1000." Upon the pre sentment of this indictment Captain Payne, by his connsel, demurred to the indictment, on the ground that these lands were not a portion of the Indian country. The court overruled the demurrer, but the judgment was even pronounced by the court, and Payne was release I. In the late fall of 1880 Payne, with several hundred families, as sembled on the Southern Kansas border, and attempted to cross the intervening fifty-mile strip of Indian territory between the south ern line of Kansas and the Okla homa lands, but were restrained by the Federal troops. For the tin.e being the project was droppid, but in the face of all these obstacles Captain Payne perse vered, and left Wichita about the first of the present month and will soon plant his colony on the town site of Oklahoma City without any opposition whatever. Without doubt the law of the land is with Payne, at least so say eminent lawyers of Su Louis, Kansas City and New York city, who have carefully examined this question in all its bearings. Oklahoma is an Indian name and means beautiful land, and if this new country is all that the colonists picture it, it must be a beautiful land, indeed. It is as yet unoccu pied by any humau bring save roving binds of Indian hunters. All this fine country will add to the wealth and prosperity of Kansas City, and will be directly tributary thereto. Iu wheat, its corn, its cattle and all of its product will naturally seek a market in Kansas Ctly. It is said to be a country diversified with dale and elope, well watered and well limbered, with a soil equaling, and much like, the prairie lands ef Kansas. The most vigorous and enterprising rail roads of the West are seeking an enlry into the Indian Territory. The St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad will cross the territory from east to west in the extension of the;r line from Vinita, Indian Territory, to Albuquerque, New , Mexico. The At lantic and Pacific Railroad will reach the borders of the ceded lands by spring. The Sar.ta Fe will, no doubt, with its usual pro gressive spirit anl enterprise, extend the Caldwell branch across lhe intervening fifty mile jdrip of connlry and tap the Oklahoma lands. It is, therefore, only a question of time when these fine lands will open to set tlement, and it requires no prophetic eye to see the Territory of Oklahoma soon lake hsr place in the eisteihood of Slates and Terri tories of the Union.

Gentlemen: I have been a sufferer from my infancy with disease of tlie kidneys, and have expended a great deal of my hard-earned wages with physicians aud at various springs in seaich of relief. None did me any good. Finally, after reading several testimonials of the Safe Kidney and Liver Cure, I concluded to try it, and, after having used four bottles, found that I had been entirely cured, and am to-day as strong and healthy as any one. I have not seen any tes timonials from any one in this section of tlie coun try, and on this account send mine volnntarilv, hoping that some oue afflicted with this dangerous disease may see it and be induced to try it. It Is the most wonderful medicine I have ever seen. Memphis, Tksn., April 13, ISSl. H. IT. WAitNEn & Co.
