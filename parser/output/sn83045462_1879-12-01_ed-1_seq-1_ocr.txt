DAVIs.-General Jefferson C. Davis, colonel of the 23d infantry, died in Chicago yesterday afternoon shortly be fore 4 o'clock. His death was sudden and caused principally by acute pneumonia, brought on by a severe cold. He had also long been a sufferer from jaundice. He was a native of Indiana, and served as a private In the Mexican war. He received a commission as lieutenant, In 1849. He became colonel of the 23d infantry during the civil war. He also received the brevet of major general of volunteers and of brigadier general of the regular army. While acting as brigadier during the war he got into a difficulty with General Nelson of Kentucky. Nelson was a lieutenant in the army and inspector general of volunteers. He was a bully in character. In the Galt House In Louisville, in the presence of Gentral Davis, he made some disparaging re marks about Indiana men generally, g that Kentuckians were the only men. Gen. Davis took up the dispute, and in the fight that fol lowed killed Nelson. He was acquitted. At the time of his death he was 58 years old. He wil be remembered as the presiding officer at the Army of the Cumberland reunion In this city a short time ago. His death promotes Lt. Col. R S. Otis to the colonelcy of the 23d infantry, and Major Alexander Dallas, of the 22d, to the lieu tena nt colonelcy of the 23d infantry. General Sherman this afternoon Issued a general order announcing to the army the death of General Davis, and giving an account of his faithful services. SENATOR JOHNSTON says there is not the slightest probability of the election of a repub lican to the U. S. Senate from Virginia. He Says the democratic majority In the state legis lature, consisting of both debt-payers and read justers, will harmonize sufficiently to choose a democratic successor to Senator Withers. THE DIRmicr LicENsE LAws.-The sub-com mittee of the committee on the District of Co lumbia, now codifying the laws of the District of Columbia, will take up the subject of taxa tion. licenses, &c., on Thursday next at 10% o'clock. Chairman Hunton is anxious to pre sent a bill acceptable to our citizens. and there fore Invites representatives of the different sides of this question to appear before the sub-com mittee at that time. A RESoLUTION TO BE INTRoDUCED.-Judge Kel ly has the following resolution ready, which he will try to get in to-day:-Resolred, That It Is the sense of the House that the negotiation by the executive department of the government of a commercial treaty whereby the rates of duty to be imposed on foreign commodities entering the United States for consumption should be fixed, would, In view of the provision of section 7, article I of the constitution of the United States, be an Infraction of the constitution and an invasion of one of the highest prerogatives of the House of Representatives. TnE PUBIC DEBT STATEMENT Issued to-day shows the decrease of debt for the month to be $79.82I.1; with the following balances in the Treasury: Cash in the Treasury, $207,217,688.15; Id certiilcates, $13,379,200; silver certideates, ,067,910; certificates of deposit outstanding, $14,100,000; refunding. $2,611.750; legal tenders outstanding, $346,681,016; fractional currency oatstanding, $15,70.34879. SENATOR BEcK.-The dtatement published in several papers. and which reached Wahilngton this morning, that Senator Beck had been seri. ously hurt by his horse falling upon him is not true. He did receive a hurt In that way, bit 1r was very slight, and he has entirely recovered. - Avow THE PREIDENT's (ALI.ERS to-day were Justice Harlan and Senators McDonald, Logan, Booth and Rollins, and Representatives Dun nell, Martin of North Carolina. Kelley, Hayes, Shallenbarger, Dwight, Chittenden. McCold, Valentine and Page; Major Brock and Distilit Commissioner Morgan. SECRETARY MCCRARY's NOMINATION TO BE JUDGE.-Among the nominations sent to the Senate to-day was that of Secretary McCrary to succeeed Judge Dillon as judge of the eighth U. S. circuit. Ex-Senator Ramsey, whose nomi nation as Secretary of War is to follow Secre tary McCrary's confirmation, Is in the city and has called upon the President and Secretary McCrary. It is expected that Secretary Mc Crary's nomination will be confirmed at an early date. Tne Meeting of Congress. INCIDENTS AND OPINIONS AT THE CAPITOL TO-DAY, The opening scenes In the House of Represen tatives to-day were without special Interest. The galleries were of course crowded and the reporters' gallery as usual jammed with a goodly sprinkling of "beats." Quite a number of mem bers had elegant boquets placed on their desks by admiring friends. The Impression amo the members generally is that the session be a long one; that not much legislation will be accomplished, but that each party will be kept busy watching the other, and taking up as good a position as possible for the Presidential year. The republicans, at least the more prominent ones, do not seem to take any stock in the idea of making Gen. Grant a captain general in the army, but rather regard it as a democratic trick. Western republicans do not like the financial recommendation In the President's message and Secretary Sherman's report. The greenbackers say that they are solid, at least In resisting such suggestions as are therein contained. The democrats say that It gives all the elements of the party a good rallying ground to oppose the President's financial views. Senator Turman says that the trouble with the democraticpat heretofore has been that It had been cmeled to attack an existing financial system. Nw suays he, the republicans, if they sustain thi President, will be compelled to fight the system. Waldo Hutchins, the new member from the Westchester, N. Y. district was In attendance. The desks of Senators were ornamented with bouquets in profusion to-day. A pyramid of flowers several feet high was sent to Vice Pre sident Wheeler. -The usual opening routine was observed In the Senate, and no business was transacted. Among the Senators the almost universal opinion is that the session will last until June, at least. Unisportant Nominations. The President sent the following nominations to the Senate to-day:-Geo. W. McCrary, of lowa, to be U.S. judge, 8th cIrcuit; Charles P. James, District of Columbia, to be associate jus tice of the Supreme Court, District of Columbia; WB. H. Hayes, of Kentucky, to be U.

The beard of see~4 as Crder THE PRESIDENT'S MRASAGE Fenlot-Citizens qf t he Senate and House Qf Rep resentatives: The members of The Forty-sixth Congress have assembled in their first regular session under circumstances calling for mutual con gratulations and grateful acknowledgment to the Giver of all good for the large and unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. The most interesting events which have occurred In our public afairs since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial operations of the government di rectly affecting the business Interests of the country. I congratulate Congress on the suc cessful execution of the resumption act. At the time fixed and in the manner contemplate: by law. United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the Ist of January last they have been promptly redeemed on presentation, and In all business transactions, public and private. In all parts of the country, they are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals deposited or exchanged for United States notes, over the amount of United States notes redeemed, Is about $40,000,000. 

RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMEN'S. The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great revival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations In trade and production. The increas ing foreign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance o trade In our favor, which has been paid in gold from the 1st of July last to November 15th, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying Improvement of the public credit. The bonds of the government bearing only 4 per cent. interest, have been sold at or above par, suflicient In amount to pay off all of the national debt which was redeemable under present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by theyrocess of refunding the debt since March 1, 1672, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the num ber of our citizens now holding the public se curities Is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt which ma tures within less than two years is $792,121,700. of which $500,000,000 bear Interest at the rate of 5 per cent., and the balance Is in bonds bearing 6 per cent. interest. It Is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the Issue of 4 per cent bonds, and by the reduction of In terest which will thus be effected, about $11, C00,00 can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of Interest to be paid by the United States, further legislation is required, which, it Is hoped, will be provided by Congress during Its present session. The coinage of gold by the mints of the UnIted States during the last liscal year was $40,986,912. The coinage of silver dollars since the passage of the act for that purpose, up to November 1, 1879, was $45.000,850, of which $12,700,314 have been issued from the Treasury and are now In circulation, aixd $32,300,506 are still In the posses sion of the government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United States and the principal commercial na tions of Europe, to efect a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver In the recog nized money of the world, leads me to recom mend that Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade, Internal and foreign, wit supply, during the coming year, Its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempting further erl ental measures with the coinage. I wo ul, however, stro ly urge upon Congress the importance of aut orizing the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the present I al ratio. The mar ket value of the silver do being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, It is obviously Impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation It will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and thus defeat the desired object, which Is a currency of both gold and silver which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world. The retirement from circulation of United States notes, with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts. Is a step to be taken in our progress toward a sale and stable cur rency. which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the government an'I the interest and security of the people. It is my firm con viction that the Issue of legal-tender paper money. based wholly upon the authority and credit of the government, except in extreme emergency, Is without warrant in the Constitu tion, and a violation of sound financial princi ples. The Issue of United States notes during the late civil war, with the capacity of legal tender between private Individuals, was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the ceuntry from Imminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after the accomplishment of this purpose was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were Issued. They anticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practical period, con sistent with the attainment of the object for which they were provided. The policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption of the Constitution has been to avoid the creation of a national debt, and when, from necessity, in the time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid off on the return of Deace as rapidly as possible. With this view. and for this purpose, It is recommended that the existing laws for the accumlalation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period be .maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea or coffee, which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars an nually to the Treasury. THE 

SUPPRESION OF POLYGAMY. The continued deilberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influential citi zens of the Territory of Utah 3f the laws of the United States for the prosecution and punish ment of polygamy, demands the attention of every department of the government. This territory has a population sumfielent to entitle it to admission as a state and 'the general inter ests of the nation, as well as the welfare of the citizens of the territory, require its advance from the territorial form of government to the responsibilities and privileges of a state. This Important change will not, however, be ap prvdby the country while the cltizens of tain very considerable number, uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime by the las of all civilized communities throughout the world. The law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with great unanimity by Congress more than 17 years ago, but has re mained until recently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah, because of the peculiar difficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed among the citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of the constitutional gurantee of religious freedom. This objection Isnow removed. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided the law to be within the legislative pwrof Conges and binding as a rule of atofor alwho reside within the territories. ThreI no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its en forceinent. It should be firmly and effectiively executed. If not suffciently stringent in Its provisions, It should be amended, and in aid Of the purpose in view,' I recommend that more comprehiensive and more searchin methods for preventing. as well as punishingr, thscrime be pvde.If necessary to secure obedience to the lathe enoyment and exercise of the rights sod priiegsof citizenship In the terri toi les of the UntdStates may be withheld or withdrawn -from those who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law, on this subject.

REFORMING THE civIL SERVICE. In a former message I invited the attention of Cengress to the subject of the reformation of the civil service of the government, and expressed thekintention of transmitting to Congress, as early as practicable, a report upon this subject by the Chairman of the Civil Service Commis 10op. In view of the facts that during a consid erable period the vernment of Great Britain has been dealing th administrative problems and abuses, in various particulars analogous to those presenttd in this country, and that. in recent years, the measures adopted were understood to have been effective and in cvery respect lijihly satisfactory, I thought it de sli able to have fuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the Chair man of the Civil Service Commission to make a thorough Investigation for this purpose. The result has been an elaborate and compre hensive report. The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system in Great Britain and of the rise and fall of the Parliainentary patronage, and of official interference with the freedom of elections. It shows that, after long trials of various kinds of examinations, those which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are car ried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have with great advantage been established as conditions of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The completion of the report, owing to the extent of the labor involved i its prepara tion, and the omission of Congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the expenses of the commission, has been postponed until theqpresent time. It is herewith transmit ted to Congress. While the reform measures of another government are of no authority for us, they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom aud their adapta tion to our Institutions and social life may com mend them to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed con cerning the defects and abuses in our civil ad ministration remain unchanged except In so far as an enlarged experience has opened my sense of the duty, both of officers and of the people themselves, to co-operate for their removal. The grave evils and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to office and of office tenure are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of the great parties, in the re ports of departments, In the debates and pro ceedings of Congress, in the message of execu tives, the gravity of these evils have been pointed out and the need of their reform has n admitted. To command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be based on common right and justice, and must be com patible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential in a' free state. When the ple have approved a policy. at a national elec tion, confidence on the part of the officers they have selected and of the advisers, who, in accordance with our political Institutions, should be consulted In the policy which It is their duty to carry into eflect Is Indispensable. It is emi nently proper that they should explain It before the people as well as illustrate its spirit in the performance of their official duties. It hardly need be pointed out that very differ ent considerations apply to the greater number of those who fill the surbordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legal Instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their best public service consists in the discharge of their functions irrespective of partisan ptics. Their duties are the same whatever pary is in power, and whatever policy prevails. As a conse quence, it follows that their tenure of office should not depend upon the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any y, but should be determined by their capaciy to serve the people most usefully, quite Irrptive of pat0san interests. The same conderations that should govern the tenure should also pre vall in the appointment, discipline and removal of these suodinates. The authority of ap poinitment and removal is not aperquisite which may be used to aid a friend or reward a parti sian, but in a trust to be exercised in the public interest under all the sanctions which attend the obligation to ap the ublic funds only for public purposes. Eery citzen has an equal right to the honor and profit of entering the public service of his country. The only just ground of discrimination Is the measure of char acter and capacity he has to make that service most useful to the peopie. Except in cases where, upon just and recognized principles, as upon the theory of pensions, offices and pro motions are bestowed as rewards for past ser vices, their bestowal upon any theory which disregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the appointing power is held. PROPER METHODS OF ExAMINATION. In the light of these principles, it becomes of great Importance to provide just and adequate means, especially for every department and large administrative office where personal dis crimination on the part of Its head Is not practi cable, for ascertaining those qualifications to which appointments and removals should hare reference. To fail to ptovide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depends, but of necessity to discourage all worthy aspirants by handing over appointments and removals to mere influence and favoritism. If it Is the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment, and the interest of the people to bestow it upon him, it would seem clear that a wise and just method of ascertain ing personal fitness for office must needs be an important and permanent function of every just and wise government. It has long since become impossible, in the great offices, for those having the duty of nomination and appointment tpper sonally examine into the individual qualiftca tions of more than a small proportion of those seeking office, and with the enlargement of civil service that poportion must continue to become less. In the earlier years of the government, the subordinate offices were so few in number that it was easy for those making appointments and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of the candidates. Party manners and methods had not then become powerful agencies of coer cion, hostile to the free and just exercise of the appointing pwr. A larg an repnsible part of the duty of re storing tecivil service to the desired purity and efciency rests with the President, and It has been my purpose to do what is within my power to advance such puetand gradual measures of reform as wil most surely and rp idly bring about that radical change of sse essential to make our administration methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of authority it is in the power of the Executive to do much to promote such a reform, But it cannot be too clayunderstood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without dooeainon the part of Congress, and consiate and intellietsupot among th pepl.teforms wihclenetegen erlyaccepted theories of pateaddemand changes in the methods of deatetare not the work of a day. Their praetfounda tions must be laid In sound pripes, and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversaries. Every wol thy offcer desires to make his offcial action a gain and an honor to his conrbut the pepethemselves, far more than thi omf cersi pblcstation, are interested in a pure, economiaand vioosadministration, By laws eatdin 1858 and 1885, and now in substance inoprtdin the Revised Statutes, the practice of abtrypoimets to the several subordinate gaeinthe great -depart ments was codmeand examinations as to capacity, to be c n by dprmental boards of- examiners were prvddfor and made conditions of n omn to the pbiser vice. These statutes are a decision byCongress that examinations of some sort as to attain ments and caaiyare essentlal to the well h of the pulcservice.

The present system does not secure the best men, and often not even fit men, for the public places. The elevation and purification of the civil service of the government will be hailed with approval by the w hole people of the United States." Con gless accordingly passed the act, approved arlh 3. 1871. "to regulate the civil service of the United States and promote the efficiency thereof," giving the necessary authority to the Executive to Institute a civil service reform. woRK OF THE coMMIssioN. Acting under this statute, which was Inter preted as Intended to secure a system of just and effectual examinations, under uniform supervi sion, a number of eminently competent persons were selected for the purpose. who entered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, prepared with an Intelligent appreciation of the require ments of the service the regulations contem plated, and took charge of the examinations, and who, In their capacity as a board, have ben known as the " Civil Service Commission." Con gress for two years appropriated the money needed for the compensation and for the expense of cai rying on the work of the commission. It appears from the report of the commission, sub mitted to the President In April, 1874, that ex - aminations had been held In various sections of the country, and that an appropriatidb of about $25,000 would be required to meet the annual ex penses, Including salaries, involved in discharg Ing the duties of the commission. The report was transmitted to Congress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the fol lowing favorable comment upon the labors of the commission: "If sustained by Congress, I have no doubt the rules can, after the experi ence gained, be so Improved and enforced as to still more materially benefit the public service and relieve the Executive, members of Congress, and the heads of departments from Influences prejudicial to good administration. The rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, have re sulted beneficially as Is shown by the opinions of the members of the Cabinet and their sub ordinates In the departments, and in that opinion I concur." And in the annual message of December of the same year, similar views are expressed, and an appropriation for continu ing the work of the commission again advised. The appropriation was not made, and. as a con sequence, the active work of the commisslon was suspended, leaving the commission Itself still in existence, without the means, therefore' of causing qualifications to be tested In any sys tenatic manner, or of securing for the public service the advantages of competition upon any extensive plan. I recommended in my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an appropriation for the resumption of the work of the commission. In the meantime, however, competitive examinations, under nijny embar rassments, have been conducted, winin limited spheres, In the executive departments in Wash ington, and in a number of the custom-houses and post offices of the principal cities of the country, with a view to further test their ef fects, and in every instance they have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been under the administration of my pre decessor. I think the economy, purity, and efli clency of the public service would be greatly promoted by their systematic introduction. wherever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of the government, together with ample provision for their general supervision, in order to secure consistency and uniform jus tice. Reports from the Secretary of the Inte rior, from the Postmaster General, from the postmaster in the city of New York, where such examinations have been some time on trial, and also from the collector of the port, the naval officer and the surveyor of that city, and from the postmaster and collectors In several of the other large cities, show that thte competitive system, where applied, has In various ways con tributed to Improve the public service. The re rts show at the results have been salutary a marked degree, and that the general ap plication of similar rules cannot fall to be of decided benefit to the service. The reports of the government officers In the city of New York, especially, bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations In their respective offices, showing that these examinations and the excellent qual ifications of those admitted to the service through them, have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons In the service, and particularly upon those aspiring to promo tion. There has been, on the part of these lat ter. n ingrv#aed Interest in the work, and a de sire to extend acquaintance with It beyond a particular desk and thus the morale of the en tire force has been raised. The examinations have been attended by many citizens, who haVe had an opportunity to thorougly Investigate the scope and character of the tests and the method of determining the results, and those visitors have, without exception, a pproved the modes employed and several of them have publicly attested their favorable opinion upon such con siderations." I deem it my duty to renew the reccmmendation contained In my annual mes sage of December 1877, requesting Congress to make the necessary appropriation for the re sumption of the work of the civil service com mission. Economy will be promoted by author izing a moderate compensation to persons In the pubilc service who inay perform extra labor upon or under the commission, asthe Executive may direct. I am convinced that If a just and definite test of merit is enforced for admission to the public service and in making promotions, such abuses as removal without good cause and partisan and official interference with the proper exercise of the appointn power, will, In a rge measure, disappear. There are other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere par tisan appointment and the constant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbing and mischievous political activity on the part of those thus appointedwhich not only interferes with the due discharge of official duty, but is incompatible with the freedom of elec tions. Not without warrant, in the view of several of my predecessors in the Presidential office. and directly In accordance with the law of 1811, already cited, I endeavored, by regula tion made on the 22d of June. 1677, to put some reasonable limits to such abuses. It may not be easy, and it may never per haps, be necessary, to define with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of federal officers. But while their light to hold and freely express their opinions cannot be quest toned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to other' subjects the time needed for the proper discharge of their official duties, nor to use the authority of their offlice to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the political action of those who hold different opinions. Reasons of justice and pub lie policy qute analogous to those which forbid the use of offcial power for tihe oppression of the private citizen Impose upon the government the duty of protecting Its officers and agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered, the practice of making levies for X' rypurposes upon the salaries of offcers is hydemoralizng to the public service and discrediabe' to the country. Though an of ficer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money In aid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any other citIzen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the omfcers It is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. I1f they are made excessive In ord1er that they may bear the tax, the excess is an indirect robbery of the public funds. I recommend, therefore, such a revision and ex tension of present statuts as shall secure to those in every grade of ofcial life or public employment the protectioh with 'which a great and enlightened nation should guard those who are faithful In its service.
