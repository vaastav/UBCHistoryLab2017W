it PAGE EIGHT. THE LAKE COUNTY TIMES Wednesday, Dee. 12, 1906. The Highest I ' ' Mission of the (vSfr" Daily ?$?' Newspaper : By CROVER.. CLEVELAND. Ex-President of I., - v j'S the United States - I f' OWEVEE good or however bad they, may bo, I suppose wo mxi3t abide the daily newspapers as they are. Perhaps un- daily newspapers as they are. Perhaps BEST !TIIEY CAN. In any event, however, we who cannot well escape the fitfulness and fervidness of the daily newspapers deserve the promise that beyond this there awaits us the restfulnee3 and comfort of conservative, deliberate and WHOLE SOMELY SUGGESTIVE periodicalism. And if such a mental cool ing place can be anticipated it will greatly encourage us to bear with bocoming resignation the heat and burden of newspaperdom. It hardly need be said that if those who are willing to read for information as well a3 for the news are to realize such compensation it 13 absolutely necessary that no stress of weather, no sordid tempta tion, no inordinate competition and NO COMPROMISE WITH SENSATIONALISM should swerve our periodicals from the way of sober, sedate sanity and useful service. If, supplementary to the daily news, there is presented to us as often a3 once a week or once a month a comprehensive view of passing events, with the deliberate judicial and helpful suggestions of thoso who by study and experience are fitted TO INTERPRET CUR RENT CONDITIONS, no thoughtful, open minded citizen who reads need lack either valuablo information or stimulating instruction. We havo fallen upon a time of such unrest and awakening that a disposition to tear down and uproot seems to prevail on every side. This has grown to bo a manifestation of intense resentment on th'e part of our people, aroused by a situation challenging their love of our good name and their devotion to the purposes of our free institution. I believe there is a danger that stands opposito this passionate tem per that should bo carefully watched. I refer to our liability to forget in the heat of our righteous indignation that, whatever may be pulled down or uprooted, SOMETHING BETTER MUST BE PUT IN ITS PLACE. We cannot act safelyor hope for reformatory result unless we look beyond the confusing rubbish and unsightly wasto of demolishing activity. The ultimate consequences of demolition and precisely what should bo built and planted when the stage of pulling down and uprooting has been passed should be clearly in the minds of those who assume to lead in the crusade against existing evils. This is not a time for IN DEFINITE STATEMENTS or inconsiderate suggestions. In any new of tho situation which confronts us there should be in ome quarter and in constant operation a powerful CONSTRUC TIVE force to balance the impetuosity and check the recklessness which are apt to grow out of the exciting havoc of overturning. This constructive fcrco should be found, if nowhere else, in the steadiness, patriotism and outspoken courage of our periodicals. THEY CAN HAVE NO HIGHER MISSION, NOP. CAN THEY SERVE 2N A MCHC EFFECTIVE WAY THE CAUCE OF CIVILIZATION AND HUMANITY'S ADVANCEMENT, A3 THEY ARE INDISSOLUBLY RE LATED TO THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL WELFARE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TIE!

He de clires it safe, as the Porto Iticans are loyal, glad to be under our flag and ''making rapid progress along the path of orderly liberty." He also says that the benefit of throwing open United States markets to the coffee of Porto Rico has not been compensation for the loss Inflicted in closing the mar kets to it abroad. IT ACQUITS TUB N ECHOES How Uncle Sam Is Overloaded By JOSEPH S. SHE RLE Y. Congressman Fifth District of Kentucky HAT is happening in every state of the Union today? Tho state legislatures, tho state governments, instead of being virile and efficient, are becoming anything but that. State officials do not want to use the power of their state govern ments BECAUSE IT MEANS STATE TAXATION to pay for its exercise, which the people have to pay directly out of their pockets, and so you find officers of state governments charged with these mat ters coming up to the national government to ask it to do WHAT IT IS THEIR DUTY TO DO, so that they be relieved of the burden and the states relieved of the cost. I believe it was intended that the individual states of America should .be sovereign states, keeping at homo among the people 90 per cent of the things that affect life, lib erty and property. I BELIEVE THE SAFETY OF THE COUNTRY LIES IN KEEPING SUCH GOVERNMENT AT HOME. But it is a modern tendency to come to .Washington because it is easier than going to the different states; and it has gone so far now that we have the doctrine proclaimedthat whatever is big, BECAUSE IT IS BIG, must bo solved by the national government. We will swamp our government. We will destroy a REPRESENTATIVE government in the true sense of the term if we go along this road. Washington, Dec. 12. The nomina tion of William II. Moody to be asso ciate justice of the supreme court of tho United States was again taken up In the senate, but because of renewed Inquiries by Democratic senators, this time relating to actions by him as a member of the house of representa tives, It went over. Carmack and Cul berson commented on a story that Moody as a member of tho house had been active In trying to have passed a bill that would reduce the repre sentation of the southern states. Honaparte Makes a Comment. With reference to the case of Bona pirte that gentleman nays: "I did not attend the conference held at Chi cago in to which reference has teen made in some press dispatches and consequently made no address there. The quotation published as ex cerpts from this supposed address are probably answers to certain printed questions sent to me and to a great man j' other persons "by those who or ganized the conference, and to which I remember sending replies. This Is all I care to say on the subject to which, I must own, I have given but little thought." Burrows on the Smoot Case. At the conclusion of morning busi ness in tho senate Burrows spoke against the retention of Smoot of Utah as a member. He closed' as follows: "It !s submitted that the senator Srnott, by becoming a mem ber of and Identifying himself with such organization as the Mormon chureh and participating in its func tions has disqualified himself for mem bership in this body. An organization thnt fosters and encourages crime; tramples? upon all law, human and di vine; practices polygamy and polyga mous co-hnbitntion; descrates the home; degrades womanhood; de bauches public morals; strikes at the C hristian civilization of this age; un dermines and sh.hes the foundations of human society and government; de stroys the sanctity of the marriage re lation; defies the authority of the state and national government; registers an oath of hostility to the American na tion, and brings the name and fame of the good people of Utah into disrepute and shame and humiliation to the American people I submit that such an organisation is not entitled to havo Its representative in the senate of the United States, and I therefore ask the adoption of the resolution." Keport of the Constitutional League on the Brownsville ACair. Washington, Dec. 12. The prelimin ary report of the "Constitutional League of America," whose headquar ters are at New York, and which sent a commission of inquiry to Fort Reno, O. T.; Fort Sam Houston and San An tonio, Tex., and Fort Brown, Browns ville, Tex., -which has been filed, both at the White House and in the senate. Is a voluminous document. After cit ing various affidavits, reports, letters, etc., It declares that every member of the negro battalion was present and accounted for; that much of the evi dence accepted as against the soldiers is incompetent and biased; that the assumption that the soldiers must have been aware of the identity of the rioters is an assumption unwarrant ed by evidence. "There is fair reason to believe," says the report, "that tho commotion was created by parties, not soldiers, partly to gratify a long harbored hat red against the soldiers, or partly to punish their Independence In boycot ting the town's 'Jim Crow' drinking saloons: and that such resistance as the rioters encountered was offered by unknown persons, who -were not sol diers from the garrison. Wherefore your memorialists pray for congression al investigation by a committee em powered to summon and examine witnesses."

The question of Heed Smoot's right to a seat as United States senator from Utah was discussed by Burrows In the senate for more than three hours, In opposition to that right. President Roosevelt's message in Porto Kico was read and an executive session was held. Tho house, ostensibly considering the legislative, executive and judicial appropriation, put in the day talking of pretty much everything else, includ ing a ponogyric on the president as the recipient of the Nobel peace prize, Ly Boutell of Illinois. No action was had on the bill. TAX ON 

INHERITANCE Wealth Should Be Taxed By Judge W. N. ASHMAN of Orphans' Court. Philadelphia BELIEVE that wealth, which owes the greatest part of its value to the protection it gets from the government without which wealth would .dwindle away, SHOULD PAY MORE toward the support of the government than.the poor. I believe that every millionaire, say" in excess of $10,000,000, should be taxed so thi.i it would be almost impossible for him to accumulate more. The power of the corporations, the power of the trusts, is enor mous for STIFLIXG COMPETITION and creating monopolies. I welcome the movement of the New York bootblacks who have started out to fight the big stores which offer everybody free shines when thev buy a pair of shoes. That is part of the bootblack's profit gone. I don't believe in the man with a thousand millions. Think of the power he has, the power to ruin parties and'destroy a thousand homes. WHEN WE HAVE FEWER OF THE ENORMOUSLY RICH WE SHALL HAVE FEWER POOR PEOPLE. The time will come then when we shall have an old age pension, industrial insurance, a pension for tho school teachers, good healthy free city amusements, shorter hours of labor and inishort a world that will be MORE LIKE HEAVEN than it is now. How a New York Man Views It Spell ing Heform Once More. Washington, Dec. 12. "Unless the supreme court should change its views there seems no question but that the general government may constitution ally impose an inheritance tax," was n opinion laid down in the house by Representative Perkins of New York. ITo said that there w as no reason that a man having $no,000.000 to dispose of should assert the right to give every dollar of it to his children. "If the father harbors the desire that his descendants shouJd be enormously rich poopie in the community tills is a vulgar desire entitled to no considera tion." he said. "Stand-pat" on spelling was Keifer's pica during the course of a speech he made in the house. He said that for the first time in the history of the country it was proposed to legislate on the proper use of the English language in the public prints. Ills idea was that the house should take no action on the subject. DeArmond took a similar view. lie suggested that the appro priations commlmttee should get into direct discussion with the president as to the letter's province in the matter. While the legislative appropriation bill was under consideration in the house DeArmond spoke at length on tL advisability of a general revision of the constitution, saying that many of the articles might he amended to suit present conditions. He wanted included in the document the princi ple of the initiative and referendum; change In the president's term of of fice; the power of vetoing items in ap propriation bills; provision for the meeting of congress shortly after its election: less number of votes to over rile a veto, and a more expeditious way of removing federal judges. President Compliments Shaw. Washington, Dec. 12. The presi dent has sent to Secretary Shaw a congratulatory letter on the secre tary's fifth and last annual report on the operations of the treasury depart ment, highly complimenting Shaw on the manner In which he met crises which If not properly met might have hed most serious effects. The presi dent says that Shaw's report Is a re markable showing. 'No Currency Legislation. Washington, Dec. 12. Currency leg islation at the present session of con gress is unlikely If a discussion In the senate committee on finance may be taken as an indication. The commttee spent considerable time talking of the necessity of currency legislation, but did not have before it any of the sev eral bills which have been advocated for passage at this session. Paris, Dec. 12. Yesterday was a historic day for France. The struggle which began in 1SS0 with the banish ment of the Jesuits reached its climax in the legal rupture of the bond which for a thousand years united church and state. Through refusal to make tbe required, declarations under the public meeting law of 1SS1 Iloman Catholic worship, except by schismatic organizations, becomes illegal. After a meeting of the cabinet ministers it was announced that Premier Cleir.eu ceau will ask parliament to suppress the pensions of the clergy, to liquidate the public property of Roman Catho lics and to distribute the presbyteries, seminaries, etc. Home Homeless in Franc. "" What happened yesterday was that the Roman Catholic church in France lost 20,000 churches which the state has confiscated, declaring them the I state's property. All the bishops and priests' homes and all the seminaries and schools were similarly confiscated. This act leaves the church homeless and in poverty in Frace, and receiv ers will be appointed to take charge of the confiscated property and liqui date the same, while Clemenceau will next ask for power to expel ecclesi astics whom he may consider danger ous to the public peace. Climax oT the Action. But the climax the crowning blow and insult to the Vatican. was the arrest of Mgr. Montagniai, secretary of the papal nunciature at Paris, who was the only direct representative of the Vatican in this city; his expulsion by force from French territory, and the seizure of his private papers, which were taken to police headquarters. No tices of eviction have been served on all Roman Catholic prelates and priests, and they vrill be enforced to day. Civil War Not Likely. Will there be civil war? It Is very doubtful; in fact it is almost certain that there will not. France Is a nation of unbelievers so far as the men are concerned. The churchs yesterday at mass contained many women few men and none was crowded. French men, while nominally Roman Catholics to a man almost, are really indifferent In the matter of religion, and very few are ready to fight for tho faith which they are supposed to hold. Why Montagnini Was Bounced, Premier Clemenceau replying to a question in the chamber of deputies as to the reason for the expulsion of Mgr. Montagnini, said It was because of his complicity with prominent clergymen of Pairs, against whom proceedings were pending, in inciting churchgoers to rebellion. "If the churches wshes," the premier continued, "there is still time to avoid a battle. We offer her the law of 1SS1, made for all Frenchmen."

ANOTHER BOY PAREICIDE Probably Kills His Father Because the Latter Used the Kod for Poor Recitations. New York, Dec 12. Because his father had kept him In the grammar schools while the boy was older and larger than others in that grada, and whipped him when he failed In his lessons, William Weedon, aged 1Q years, shot his father. John Weedon, In the face and neck at their home In Glendale, L. I. It is feared that the father's wounds will be fatal. The boy was arrested. He told the police that his father had compelled him to decite his lessons at home In the mornings before going to scool, and w"hen he failed In them whipped him. William said he determined to stand It no longer, borrowed a little revolver from a schoolmate, and when his fa ther started to whip him shot him twice.

Montagnini, secretary of the papal nunciature at Paris, who has represented the Vatican at the Trench capital since the recall of the nuncio, has caused not only astonish ment but consternation at the Vati can. According to Vatican cfflcials this is on evident proof that the French government wishes not only to strike at the church as a religious Institution, but to represent it as an enemy of the republic and allied with the repub lic's foes. Persons thoroughly familiar with Vatican affairs declare that no such excitement and apprehension have pre vailed at the Vatican since the loss of temporal power. The pope is described as calmer than any member of hl3 entourage. He is reported to have said: "Man cannot fathom all the designs of providence. Terheps the present tribulations are Intended only to quicken and emphasize the ultimate and inevitable triumph of the church." Many cipher telegrams are being ex changed between the Vatican and Car dinal Richard, the archbishop of Pirls, who has been asked to ascertain If the expulsion of Mgr. Montagnini and the searching of his house Is In violation of French law. The Italian foreign office has not received any communication from the Italian am bassador at Paris concerning this inci dent, and It does not know whether Mgr. Montagnini h.; asked for the protection of the Italian government or not. A curious phase of the situation 13 that Mgr. Montagnini being an Ital ian subject any protest against big expulsion or the searching cf bis house must be communicated to the French government through the Italian government. YOU
