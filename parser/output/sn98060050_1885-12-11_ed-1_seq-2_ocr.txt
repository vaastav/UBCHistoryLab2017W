THE VERMONT PHOENIX, AND RECORD AND FARMER, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1885. pone it now on hit way to Siberia, bearing the testimonials voted by Congress to those who generously succored the survivors of the unfortunate Jeanetle expedition. It Is gratifying to advert to the cordiality of our Intercourse with Spain. The long pending claim of the owners of the ship Ma souio fur lota suffered through the admitted dereliction of the Spanish authorities in the Fbilllptne islands has, been adjusted by arbi. tration, and an indemnity awarded. The principle of arbitration in such esses to which the United States have long and con sistently adhered thus receives n fresh and gratifying confirmation. CHir.EMSHlr AND NAICHAL17.ATION. The Inadequacy of existing legislation touching citlrenshlp and naturalization do. niands 3 our consideration. While recognU lug the right of expatriation, no statutory provision eiiats providing means for renounc ing cilizanship by an American citizen, native bum or naturalized, or for terminating and vacnting an Improper acquisition of citizen ship. Even a fraudulent decree of naturali zation cannot now be canceled. The privi lege and franchise of American citizenship should be granted with care, and extend to those only who Intend In good faith to assume Its duties and responsibilities when attaining its privileges and benefits. It should be with held from those who merely go through the forms of naturalization, with the Intent of escaping the duties of tbelr original allegiance without taking upon themselves those of their new state, or who may acquire the right of American citizenship for no other than a hostile purpose toward their original govern, innnts. These evils have had many flagrant illustrations. nEcirnociTT with the west ismes. On taking office I withdrew fpr re examlna tion the treaties signed with Spain aud Santo Dowlngo, then pending before the senate. Tne result has been to satisfy me of the incx pedlenoy of entering Into eugagemf nts of this character not oovcring the entire traiHa. These treaties contemplated the surrender by the United States of large revenues for Inade quale considerations.- Upon sugar alone do. ties were surrendered to an amount far ex ceeding all the advantages offered In each case. Even were it intended to relieve our consumers, it was evident, eo long as the tx emption but partially covered our importa tions, that such relief would be illusory. To relinquish a revenue so essential seemed high Ir improvident at a time when new and large drains udoo the treasury were contemplated. Moreover, embarrassing questions would have arisen under the favored nation clauses of the treaties with other nations. THE CONSULAH AND DIPLOMATIC SERVICE. I earnestly urge that Congress recast the appropriations for the maintenance of the diplomatic and consular service on a footing 03mmensurate with the importance of our national interests. At every post where a representative is neoessary, the salary should be so graded as to permit him to live with oomfort. With the assignment of adeqnate salariee, the so-called notarial extra-ollljial fees which our officers abroad are now per mitted to treat as personal perquisites should be done away with. Every act requiring the oertificition and seal of office should be taxa ble at schedule rates, and the fee therefor re turned to the treasury. By restoring these revenues to the public use, the consular ser vice would be self-supporting, even with a liberal increase of the present low salaries. In further prevention of abuses, a system of consular inspection should be instituted. THE 

FINANCES. The report of the secretary 'u ly exhibits the condition of the public: finauces and of lbs several branches of the government con. nected with his depart-nent, Tne ordinary receipts from all sources for the fi.cal year ended June 30, 1885, were, $322,GU0,7O0 Of this sum $181,471. !31) was received from customs, und $112,4118,725 from Internal rev enue. The total receipts, as given above, were $24,8211,103 less than those for the year ended June 30, 1884. This diminution em braces a falling off of $13,n:."i,fi-"'0 in the re ceipts from customs, and $D G87 310 in the receipts from internal revenue. The total or dinary expenditures of the government for the fl cal year were $-!G0,-!2fi,.3.-, 1. aving a surplus in the treasury at tbe close of the year of $03,403,771. This is $t0,!2!,8.-.4 Ires than tbe sutplus re ported at tbe close of the previous year. The amount paid on the public debt dur ing the fiscal year ended June 30, 188.", was $4.,'.IU3,23., and there has been paid since that date and un to November 1. 188.", the sum of $.1011,828, leaving tbe amount of debt at the last named date $1,514,475,800. Th-sre was, however, at that time, in tne treasury upplioable to the general purposes of the government, the sum of $00,818, 2Q2. The value of tbe exports from the United States to foreign countriis during tbe last fieaal year was as folio va : Domestic mer chandise, $720 082,1)10; foreign merchan dise, $15,fi0G,60!; total, $742,189,755 J gold, $8,477,8112; silver, 633,753,633; total, $781, 421,280. Of the entire amount of duties collected, 70 per cent was collected from tbe following articles of import: Sugar and molasses 20, wool and its manufactures 15, silk and its manufactures 8, iron and steel and their man ufactures 7, cotton manufactures (i, flu hemp and jute and their manufactures 5. REDUCTION OF BEVENCE. The fact that our revenues are in excess of the actual needs of an economical adminis tration of the government justifies a reduc tion In tbe amount exacted from the people for its support. Oar government is but tne means established by the will of a free peo pie by which certain principles are applied, which they have adopted for th.'ir benefit and protection, and it is never better admin istered and its true spirit Is never belter on served than when the people's taxation for its support is scrupulously limited to the ac tual neaesslty of expenditure, and distributed according to a just and equitable plan. The proposition with which we have to deal is tbe reduction of the revenue received by the government and indirectly paid by tne peo pie from customs duties. The question of free trade is not involved nor is tbere now any occasion for tbe general discussion of tbe wisdom or expediency of a protective system. JiHtioe and fairness dictate tnat in any mod. ideation of our present laws relating to reve nue, the industries and interests which have been encouraged by such law and in which our citizens have large investments, should not be ruthlessly injured or destroyed. We should also deal with the subnet in such a manner as to protect the interests of Ameri. can labor, which is the capital of our work, ingmen. Its stability and proper remunera tion furnish the most justifiable pretext for a protective policy. Within these limitations, a certain reduction should be made in our customs revenue. The amount of such re duction having been determined, the inquiry follows, where cam it best be remitted, and what articles can best be released from duty in the interest of our citizens? I think tbe reduction should be made in tbe revenue de. rived from a tax upon the imported neces saries of life. We thus directly lessen the cost of living in every family of tbe land and release to tbe people in every humble home n larger measure ot lue rewaru ut irugat in dustry. THE 

NATIONAL BANKS. During the year ending November 1, 1835, 145 national banks were organized, with an aggregate capital of $10,1)38,000, and dr. culating notes have been issued to them amounting to $4,274,010. The whole num ber of these banks in existenoe on the day above mentioned was 2727, Nothing more important than the present oondition of our currency and oolnage can claim your atten tion. THE 

SILTED COINAGE. Since February. 1878. tbe government has, under the ootnpulsory provisions of law, pur. chased silver bullion aud coined tbe same at the rate of more than $2,000,000 every month. By this process, up to the present date 315,759,431 silver dollars have been coined. Necessity for such an addition to tbe silver currency of tbe nation as is compelled by the silver coinage act, is negatived by tbe tact mat up 10 tne present only about 50,000, 000 of the silver dollars so coined have actu. ally found their way Into circulation, leaving more loan iua,uuu,uuu in tne possession of me -government, tne custody of which hi entailed a considerable expense for the con struction of vaults for its deposit. Against this latter amount there are outstanding silver certincatea amounting to about SU3.000.000. Every month two millions of cold in the nub ile treasury. are paid out for two millions or more of silver dollars to be added to tbe idle mass already accumulated. If continued long enough, this operation will result in the aubatitution of silver for all tbe gold tbe gov ernment owns applicable to its general pur poses. This hoarding of gold has already begun. When the time comes that gold has been with drawn from circulation, then will be apparent tbe difference between the real value of the silver dollar and a dollar In gold, and the two coins will part company, Qold, still the standard of value, and necessary In our deal ings with other countries, will be at a premi um over silver. Banks which have aubstl. tuted gold for the deposits of their cuatomera may pay them with silver bought with suob gold, thus making a handsome profit. Iticb speculators will sell their boarded gold to their neighbors, who need it to liquidate their foreign debts, at a ruinous premium on silver, and the laboring men and women of tbe land, most defenoelest of all, will find that the dol lar received for tbe wage of their toll bat sad. ly shrunk In Its purchasing power. It may be said that the latter result will be but tempo. rary, and that ultimately th prioe of labor will be adjusted to tbe change, but even if this takes place, the wage-worker cannot pot. sibly gain, but mutt Inevitably lose, since the nrlce be la compelled to pay for his living will not only be measured in a coin heavily depre ciated and Uuotuatlng and unoertatn in us value, but this uncertainty In the value of tbe purchasing medium will be made tbe pretext for an advanoe in prices beyond that justified by actual depreciation. Tbe words uttered In ln.il by Daniel Webster in tne senate oi tbe United States are true to day "The very man of all others who hat tho deepest inter est in a sound currency, who suffers most by mischievous legislation in money matters. Is the man who earns hit dally bread by his dally loll." A special effjrt has been made by the see retary of the treasury to Increase tbe amount of our silver in circulation, but the fact that a large share of tbe limited amount thus put out has soon returned to the public treasury in payment of dutlea leads to the belief that the people do not now desire to keep it In hand, and this, with tbe evident disposition to hoard gold, gives rise to the suspicion that there already exists a lack of confidence among the people touching our financial pro cesses. It is perfectly apparent that a line of action in regard to our currenoy cannot wisely be settled upon or persisted in without consider ing the attitude on tbe subject of other coun tries with whom we maintain intercourse through commerce, trade and travel. To give full effect to tbe design of Ooogreit on tuls subject I have male careful and earnest endeavors since the adjournment of the last Congress. To this end I delegated a gentle man welt instructed in fiscal science to pro ceed to tbe final oial centers of Europe, and in conjunction with our ministers to England, France and Germany, to obtain full know), edge of tbe attitude and interest of those governments in respect of the establishment of Buoh an international ratio as would pro cure a free coinage of both metals at tbe mints of those countries and our own. By my direction our consul general at Paris has given close attention to tho proceedings of tbe Congress of the Latin union in order to indicate our interest in Its object and report its action. It may be said in brief as tbe re sult of these efforts thst the attitude of tbe leading powers remains substantially un changed since the monetary conference of 1881. It is a significant tact that four of the nve countries composing tbe ijitin union, mentioned in our coinage act, embarrassed with their diver currency, have juat com pleted an agreement among themselves that no more silver shall be coined by their re spective governments, and that such as bat been already coined aud in circulation shall be redeemed in gold by the country of tbe coinage. The resort to this expedient by these countries may well arrest the attention of those who suppose that we can succeed without shock or injury in the attempt to clr culate upon Its merits all the silver we may coin under the provisions of our silver coin. age act. That disaster has not already overtaken ns furulibes no proof that danger does not wait upon a continuation of the present Bitver coin age. Prosperity hesitates npon our thresh, old because of the dangers and uncertainties surrounding this question. Capital timidly shrinks from trade, and investors are unwill ing to take tbe chance of the questionable shaj e in which their money will be returned to them, while enterprise halts at a risk against which care aud sagacious management di not protect. As a necesssry consequence labor lacks employment, and suffering and distress are visited upon ft portion of our fel low citizens especially entitled to tbe careiui consideration of those charged with tbe duties of legislation. No interest appeals to us so strongly for a safe and stable currency aa the vast army of unemployed. I recommend the suspension of the oom pulsory coinage of silver dollars directed by tbe law passed in February, 1878. THE 

LIFE SAVINO 8EBVICE. The most gratifying results have attended tbe operations of the life-saving service dur ing the last fiscal year. The number of sta tions in commission at tbe close of tbe year was 2030. Tbe number of disasters to ves sels and craft of all kinds within their field of action was 371. The number of persons endangered in suob disasters was 2431), of whom 2428 were Bavtd and only 11 lost. Other lives which were imperiled, though not by disasters to shipping, were also res cued, and a large amount of property was saved through tbe aid of this service. The cost of its maintenance during the year was $828,474. MILITARY AFFAIRS. The report of tbe secretary of war is here, with submitted. Tbe atteution of Congress is invited to the detailed account which it contains of the administration of his depart ment and his recommendations and sugges tions for tbe improvement of tbe service. The army consisted at the date of tbe last consolidated return', of 2154 officers aud 24, 705 enlisted men. The expenses of the de partment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1885, Including $13,101,31)4 for public works and river and harbor improvements, were I Air. R.O flO'l Tl .hMm th tmnna wMh waraH depatcbed in pursuit or tbe small band of Iudians who left their reservation in Arizona and oommilted murders and outrages, two regiments of cavalry and one of Infantry were sent last June to Indian territory to pre vent an outbreak. Troops were also sent to ltock Springs in Wyoming territory, after the massacre of Chinese there, to prevent further disturbance, and afterward to Seattle in Washington territory to avert a threatened attack upon Chinese laborers and domestio violence tbere. In both cases tbe mere pres ence of troops had the desired t fleet. It appears that the number of desertions have diminished, but that during the last fis cal year they numbered 2927, and one in stance is given by the lieutenant-general of six desertions by the same recruit. I am con vinced that tbia number 8f desertions can be much diminished by better discipline and treatment, tut tbe punishment should be in creased for repeated offenses. These deser tions might also be reduced by lessening the term of first enlistments, thus allowing a dis contented recruit to contemplate a nearer discharge and tbe army a profitable riddanoe. After one term of service a re-enlistment would be quite apt to secure a contented re cruit and a good soldier. The military academy at West Point is re ported as being in a high state of efficiency, and well equipped for the satisfactory ac complishment of the purposes of Its mainte nance. There should be a general law of Congress prohibiting tbe construction of bridges over navigable waters in such manner as to ob struct navigation, with provisions for pre venting tne same, it seems mat under ex. tiling statutes the government cannot inter, yene to prevent suob a construction when en tered upon without its consent, though when such consent is asked and granted upon con dition, tbe authority to insist npon such con dition is clear. Thus it Is represented that while the officers of the government are with great care guarding againBt the obstruction of navigation by a bridge across tbe Mississ Ippt river at St. Pan), a large pier for a bridge nas been omit just below ibis plaoe, directly in tbe navigable channel of tbe liv. er. If such things are to be permitted a strong argument is presented against the ap. propriation of large sums of money to Im prove the navigation of this and other Im portant highways of commerce. THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the secretary of the nan gives a history of the operation! of bis de partment, and tne present condition of the work committed to his charge. .He details in full tbe course pursued by him to protect the rights of the government in reaped to cer tain vessels unfinished at tbe time of bis ac cession to offioe, and also concerning the de spatch boat Dolphin, claimed to be com. pleted and awaiting tbe acceptance of the de partment. No one oan fail to see from the recitals oontained in this report that only the application or business principles bas been insisted upon In the treatment of this sub ject, and that whatever controversy has arts, en, was caused by the exaction on the part of tbe department of contract obligations as they were legally construed. In tbe case of the Dolphin, with entire justice to the con tractor, an agreement has been entered into firoviding for the ascertainment by a judicial nqoiry of tbe complete or partial compliance with tbe contract in ber construction, and further providing for the assessment of any damages to which tbe government may be entitled on account of a partial failure to per. form such contract, or by the payment still remaining unpaid upon her price in case full performance Is-adjudged. Tbe contractor by reason nf hta fallnrA in hnatnaaa V.atn r nml.l. to complete the other three vessels, they I were tsseu possession oi by tne government in their unfinished state under a clauto in a contract permitting suob a course, and are now in prooest of completion In tbe yard of the contractor, but under the supervision of tbe navy department. Congress at its last session authorized the construction of two additional new cruisers and two gun-boaU at a cost not exoeedlng $2,995,000. Tbe appropriation for this pur. nose having become available on tbe first of July last steps were at onoa taken for the procurement of such plans for tbe construc tion of these vessels as would be likely to In sure their usefulness when completed, All most admit tbe importance of an effective navy to a nation like ours, having suoh an extended sea ooast to protoct. And yet we have not a vessel of war that oould keep tbe seas against a first olaas vessel of any impor tant power. Such a condition ought not loug er to continue. The nation that cannot re sist aggression It constantly exposed to it, Its forelgu polloy la or neoeasily weak and us negotlationt are conducted with disadvantage beoause It is not in a oondition to enforce the terms dictated by the sense of right and ius- tioe. Inspired as I am by tho hope that tbe day la not very far distant when our navy will be suoh aa befits our standing among tbe na tions of tbe earth, I deem it my duly to espe cially direct tbe attention of Congress to tbe olose of tbe report of tbe secretary of the na vy, in wmcn ine numtiiaung weaanesa ot tne present organization of his department is ex hibited and tbe startling abuses aud waste of its present methods are exposed. The con viotlon is foroed upon us with tbe oertainty of mathematical demonstration that before we proceed further in tbe restoration of a na vy we need a thoroughly reorganized navy department. The fact that within 17 years more than $75,000,000 has been spent in tbe construc tion, repair, equipment and armament of ves sels, and the further fact that instead of an effective, creditable fleet we have only tho diaoontent and apprehension ot a nation un defended by war vessels, added to tho dis closures now made, does not permit us to doubt that every attempt to revive our navy has thus far for the most part been misdirect ed, and all our efforts In that direction have been little better than blind groplnga and ex pensive, aimless follies. the rosT-orricE department. Tbe affairs of the postal service are exhib ited by tbe report of tbe Postmaster Ueneral, wMoh will be laid before you. Tbe postal revenue, whose ratio ot gain upon the rising prosperity of 1882 and 1883 outstripped the increasing oxpensea of our growing service, was checked by tbe reduction in the rate nf letter postage which took effect with tbe be ginning ot October in tbe latter year, m d it diminished during tbe two past fiscal years $2,790,000, in about the proportion nf $2, 270 000 In 1884 to $520,000 In 1885. Natural crowtb and development have meantime In creased expenditure, resulting in a deficiency In the revenue to meet tbe expenses of tbe department of $5,250,000 for tbe year 1884, and $8,333,000 in the last fiscal year. The anticipated and natural revival of tbe revenue bas been oppressed and retarded by tne un favorable business condition of tbe country, of wbicb tbe postal service Is a faithful indi cator. I approve the recommendation of the Post master General to reduce the charg s on do rueatic money -orders ot $5 and less from eight to five cents. This change will materially aid those of our people who most of all avail themselves ot their instrumentality, but to wbom tbe element of cheapness is or tb greatest importance. With this reduction the system would still remain self supporting. It was decided, with my approbation, after sufficient examination, to be inexpedient for tbe post-office department to contract for car rying our foreign mails under tbe additional authority given by the last Cougress. The amount limited was inadequate to pay all within tbe purview of tbe law tbe full rate of uO cents per mile, and It would Lave been un just and unwise to have given it to some aud denied it to others. Some of the steamship companies, upon tbe refusal uf tbe Postmas ter Ueneral to attempt by the means provided the distribution of tne sum appropriated as an extra compensation, withdrew the services of their vessels, and thereby occasioned slight lncouvenience tbougu no considerable injury, Tbe mails have been despatched by other means. Whatever may be thought of the policy of subsidizing any line of Iiurlio con veyance or trade, I am satisfied that it should not be done under cover of an expenditure incideut to tbe administration of the depart ment. Nor should there he any uncertainty as to the recipients of tbe subsidy, or discre tion lelt to an executive olnoeras to Its distri bution. If such gifts of the public money are to be made for the purpose uf aiding any enterprise in tbe supposed interest of the public, I cannot but think that tbe amount to be paie! aud the beneficiary might better be determined by Congress than in any other way. THE 

DEPARTMENT Or JUBT1CE. The condilion of business in the courtB of tbe United States is such that tbere Beems to be an imperative necessity for remedial legis lation on tbe subject. Sjnie ot these courts are so overburdened with pending causes tbat tbe delays iu determining litigattou amount often to a denial of justice. Among tbe plans suggested for relief is one submitted by tbe attorney-general. Its main features are : Tbe transfer of all the original jurisdiction of the circuit courts to tbe district courts, and an increase of judges for the latter where necessary ; an addition of judges to the cir cuit courts and constituting them exclusively courts of appeal, and reasonably limiting ap peals thereto; further restrictions of the right to remove causes from the state to federal oourts; permitting appeals to tbe supreme court from the courts of tbe D.strict uf Co lumbia and the territories only in the same caseB as they are allowed from state courts; and guarding against unnecessary appeals from the circuit courts. 1 approve the plan thus outlined, and recommend the legislation necessary for its application to our judicial system. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND THE 1NDIANB. The report of the secretary of the interior contains an aocoont of the operations of this important department, and much interesting information will be submitted for your con aideration. The most intricate and difficult subject In charge of tho department is the treatment and management of the Indians. I am satisfied that some progress may be noted in tbeir condilion aa a result of tbe prudent administration of tbe present laws and regu Islions for tbeir oontrol. But it is submitted that tbere is lack of a fixed purpose of policy on this subject, which should be supplied. It is useless to dilate upon tbe wrongs uf tbe Indians, and as useless to Indulge in tbe beanies belief that because tbeir wrongs are refenged in their own atrocious manner, therefore tbey should be exterminated. Tbey are witbin the care of our government, and their rights are or should be protected from invasion by the most solemn obligations. They are properly enough called tbe wards of tbe government, and it should be borne In mind that this guardianship involves on our part efforts for the Improvement of tbeir condition and the enforcement of their rightB. There seems to be general concurrence in tbe proposition tbat the ultimate object of tbeir treatment should be civilization and citizen ship. Tbe difficulty appears to be in tbe ae lection of the means to be at present employ ed toward the attainment of this result. Our Indian population, exclusive ot those in Alas ka, is reported as numbering 200,000, nearly all being located on lands set apart for tbeir use and occupation, aggregating over 134, 000,000 acres. These lands are included in the boundaries of 171 reservations of differ ent dimensions, scattered in 21 states and ter. ritories, presenting great variations in climate and in tbe kind and quality of their soils. Among the Indians upon these several reser vations there exist the most marked differen ces in natural traits and dispositions, and in their progress toward civilization. While some are lazy, vicious and stupid, others are industrious, peaoefnl and intelligent. While a portion of them are Belt supporting and In dependent, and have bo far advanoed in civi lization that tbey make tbeir own laws, ad ministered through officers of theirowncholce, and eduoata their children in schools of tbeir own establishment and maintenance, others still retain in squalor and dependence almost the savagery ot their natural state. In deal ing with this question, desires manifested by the Indians should not be ignored. Here again we find great diversity. With some the tribal relation is cherished with utmost tena city, while its bold upon others is considera bly relaxed. Tbe love of borne is strong upon all; yet tbere are those whose attachment to a particular locality is by no means unyield ing. Tbe ownership of their lands in sere, ralty is muoh desired by some, while by otb. era and sometimes among tbe most civilized such a distribution would be bitterly op. posed. Tbe history ot all tbe progress wbicb has been made In tbe civilization of the In. dian, I think, will disclose tbe fact that the beginning bas been religious teaching, fol. lowed by or accompanying secular education. While self-saorificing and pious men and wom en, who have aided in this good work by their independent endeavor, have for their reward tbe beneficent results of tbelr labor and tbe consciousness of Christian duty well perform ed, their valuable aervloes should be fully ac knowledged by all who under tbe law are charged with the oontrol and management of our Indian wards. What bat been said indi cates tbat in the present condition of tbe In. diana no attempts ahould be made to apply a fixed and unyielding plan of action to their varied and varying needs and circumstances, I recommend tbe passage ot a law author izing tbe appointment of six commissioners, three ot whom shall be detailed from tbe ar my, to be oharged with the duty of a careful inspection from time to time of all the In diana upon our reservations or subject to tbe care and oontrol ot the government, with a view ot discovering their exact oondition aud needs and determining what ttept shall be taken on behatt ot the government to Im prove their situation In tbe direction ot their self support and complete civilization. The expense of the Indian bureau during the last fiscal year was more tbau $0,500,000. I be lieve much of tbia expenditure might be sav ed under the plan proposed ; that its econom ical effects would be Increased with Its con tinuance tbat the safety of our frontier settlers would be subserved under Its opera tion, and mat tbe nation would be saved through its results from the imputation of in- uumauity, injustice and mismanagement. The public domain had its origin in ces sions of land by tbe states to the general gov ernment. The first session was made by tbe state of New York, and the largest, which in area exceed all the others, by the state ot Vir ginia, ine territory, the proprietorship or which became thus invested in the general government, extended from the western line ot Pennsylvania to the Mississippi river. Anese patriotic donations oi tne elates were encumbered with no condition exoept tbat they should be held and used "for the com mon benefit of tbe United States." lly pur chase with tbe common fund of all the peo ple, auditions were mane to mis domain un til It extended to the northern line of Mexico, the Pacific ooean and tbe polar tea. The ori ginal trust, "for the common benefit of tbe United States," attached to all. In tbe exe cution of that trust, tbe policy of many homes rather than larger estates was adopted by tbe government, thst these might be easily ob tained and be tbe abodes of security and con tentment. Tbe laws for tbeir acquisition were few, easily understood, and general in their character: but the pressure or local in terests, combined with tbe speculative spirit, nave in many instances prooured the passage of laws which marred tbe harmony of the general plan and encumbored the system with a multitude of general and special enactments which render the land laws complicated and subject lilies to uncertainty and tbe purcbas- era often to oppression and wrong. Laws wbicb were intended for the common benefit have been perverted so that large quantities of lsnd are vesting iu single ownerships. Exclusive of Alaska, about three fifths of Ihe national domain has been sold or sub iected to contract or grant. Of tbe remain Ing two-fifths a considerable portion is either mountain or desert. A rapidly increasing population creates a growing demand for homes; and the accumulation of wealth In spires an eager competition to obtain the pubho land tor speculative purposes. In tbe future the collision of Interests will be more marked than In tbe past and the execution of the nation's trust in behalf of our settlers will be more difficult. I therefore commend vour attention to the reuommendalion oon tamed in the report of tbe secretary of tbe interior with reference to tbe repeat and modification ot certain of our land laws. Tbe nation has made princely grants and subsidies to a system of railroads projected as great national highways to coonect tbe Pacific states with tbe East. It hat been charged that these donations from tbe people have been diverted to private gain and cor. rupt uses ; and thus public indignation tits been aroused and suspicion engendered, uur .great nation does not begrudge its generos ity ; but 11 abhors peculation and rraud ; and the favorable regard of our people fur tbe great corporations to wb cn tbeae grants were made can only be revived by a restora tion of confidence to be secured by tbeir con stant, unequivocal and clearly manifested in. tegrity. A faithful application of the undi minished proceeds of tbe grants to tbe oon' tlruction and perfecting ot tbeir roads, an honest discbarge oi tbeir obligations, and en tire justice to all the people in tbe enjoy ment of tbeir rights on these highways ot travel is all tbe public asks and It will be con tent with no less. To secure these things should be tbe common purpose of tbe officers of the government as well as of tbe corpora tions. With this accomplished, prosperity would be permanently secured to Ihe roads aLd national pride would take tbe place of national complaint. THE 

PENSION BUREAU. It appears from the report of the commis sioner of pensions tbat there were on the first day ot July,, 1885, 345,125 persons borne upon the pension roue, wbo were classified aa follows : Army Invalids, 241,450; widows, minor children aud dependeut relatives of deceased soldiers, 78,841. Navy Invalids, 2745; navy widows, minor children and dependent, WHO. survivors or the war or 1HI2, 2945 widows uf those wbo served in that war, 17, 212. About one man in ten of all those wbo en listed in tbe late war are reported aa receiv ing pensions. Exclusive of tbe dependents or deceased soldiers, on the oral or July, 1875, tbe number of pensioners was 234.821 : and the increase within tbe ten years there after was 1 10.3414. While there it ntrexpeod- iture of Ihe. public funds wbioh the people more cbeerroiiy approve than tbat made In recognition ot services of our soldiers living and dead, ine sentiment underlying tbe sub ject should not be vitiated by the lutroduo tion of any fraudulent practices. Tberefore it is fully as important tbat the rolls should be cleansed of all those whom frauds have secured a place thereon, a tbat meritorious claims should be speedily examined and ad- justed. Tbe reform in the methods of doing ine business in this bureau which bava lately been inaugurated, promise better results in both these directions. THE MORMON QUESTION. In the territory ot Utah, the law of the United States passed fur tbe suppression of polygamy nas been energetically and faith lolly executed during the past year with measurably good results. A number of con victions have been secured for unlawful co habitation, and in aome cases pleas of croiltr have been entered and a alight punishment imposed, upon a promise by tbe accused tbat tney would not again oneud against tbe law, nor advise, counsel, aid, or abet in any way its violation by others. Tbe Utah commis sioners express (he opinion, based upon such information as tbey are able to obtain, tbat out raw polygamous marriages have taken place in tbe territory during the last year. Tbey further report tbat, while tbere cannot be found upon the registration list of voters the name of a man actually guilty of polyga my, and while none of that class bold office, ytt at the last election in the territory all the offioera elected, except in one county, were men who, though not actually living in the practice of polygamy, subscribe to the doc trine of polygamous marriages aa divine rev. elation and a law unto all, higher and more Dinning upon tne conscience than any human law, local or national. Thus is tbe stranse spectacle presented of a oommunity protect- eu uj a republican rorm oi government, to wbicb tbey owe allegiance, sustaining by their suffrages a principle and a belief which sets at naught that obligation of absolute obedience to the law ot the land which Ilea at tbe foundation of republican institutions. Tbe strength, tbe perpetuity and destiny of tbe nation rest upon our homes, estab lished by tbe law of God, guarded by paren tal care, regulated by parental authority and sanctified by parental love. These are not tbe homes of polygamy. Tbe mothers ot our land wbo rule tbe nation, aa thev mould tbe characters and guide the actions of tbeir sons, live according to God's holy ordlnanoet and eaoh secure and happy in tbe exclusive love of the father of her children, abed the warm light of true womanhood nnperverted and unpolluted upon all within her pure and wbole.ome family oircle. These are not the cheerless, crushed and unwomanly mothers of polygamy. The fathers of our families are the best citizens of the republic; wife and children are the sources of patriotism, and conjugal and parental affection beget devo tion to tbe country. Tbe man who, unde fined with plural marriage, is surrounded in his single home with his wife and children has a stake in the country whiob Inspires him with respect for it laws and courage for its defence. These are not the father of po lygamous familes. Tbere is no feature of this practice or tbe system which aanctlona it wblch is not opposed to all that la of value iu our institutions. There should be no re laxation in tbe firm but just execution ot the law in operation, and I should be glad to ap. prove suoh further discreet legislation a will rid the country of tbia blot upon it fair fame. Sinoe the people upholding polyga my in our territories are reinforoed by immi gration from other lands, I recommend tbat a law be passed to prevent the Importation of Mormon Into the country. THE AC1RICULTCBAL DEPARTMENT. The agricultural interest of tbe country demands just recognition and liberal enoour. agement. It sustains with certainty and un failing strength tbe nation's prosperity by tbe products of its steady toil, and bear It full share of the burden of taxation without conjplaint. Our agriculturist have but slight personal representation in tbe counsels of tbe nation, are generally content with tbe humbler duties of citizenship and willing to trust to tbe bounty of nature for a reward of their labor; but tbe magnitude and value of tbia industry is appreciated when tbe state, ment ia made that, of our total annual ex ports, more than three-fourths' are the prod ucts of agriculture, and of our total popula tion nearly one-half is engaged in that oaou. pation. The department of agriculture was created for the purpose of acquiring and diffusing among the people useful Information respect ing the subject it baa in charge and aiding in tbe cause of Intelligent and progressive farming by the collection of statistics, by testing the value and usefulness of new seeds and plants, and distributing such aa are found desirable among agriculturists. This and other power and duties with wbicn tu's de partment it Invested are of the utmost im portance, and if wisely exercised must bo ot great benefit to tbe country. The aim ot our beneficent government is tbe improve. ment or tne people in every station, aua tuo amelioration of tbelr condition. Surely our agriculturists should not be neglected. Tbe instrumentality established in aid of farmers of tbe land should not only be well equipped for tbe accomplishment of It purposes, but those for whose benefit it, baa been adopted should be encouraged to avail themselves fnl. ly of it advantages. The prohibition oi tne importation into several eountriea of certain of our animals and their produott, based upon tbe suspicion tbat bealtb I endangered in tneir use and consumption, suggests the importance of suoh precautions for tbe protection of our stock of all kinds agalust disease at will disarm the suspicion of danger aud cause tbe removal or sucn an injurious proniuuion. ir tbe law now in operation aro mauuioient to accomplish protection, I recommend their amendment to meet tbe necessities of tbe tituatlon, and I commend to the considers tion of Congress tbe suggestions contained in the report ot the commissioner of agricul ture, calculated to Increase tbe value andtm- ciency of this department. CIVIL BEBVICE REFORM. Tbe rrnort of tbe civll-serrlcs cotnmlssloa wblch will be submitted contains an account ol tbe manner In wblch tbs eltil-eervleo law bss been executed dur ing tbe last year and much vsluable Information on tola Important sot Ject. 1 in Inclined to think tbere Is no sentiment more general In tbe minds of tbe people of our country, tbsn a conviction of tbe cor rectness or Ibe prioclpie upon wbicn tne law enforc ing civil-service reform la bssed. In its present con. ditlon tbs Isw regulates only a part of tbe subordln. sis public positions tbrougboul lb country. II ap plies tbe test of fltoeas to applicants for tbeae places by mrsns of a competitive examination, and gives Urge discretion to Ibe commissioners as to Ibe cbsr. acterof tbs examination, and many otbtr mailers connected wltb Its execution. Thus tbe rules and regulations adorned bv tbs commission bare mncb to do wltb tbe prsctleal usefulness of tbe statute and wiin ine resuus or us sripiicsuoo. a ne people msy well trust tbs commission lo execnte tbe Isw wltb perfect fairness, and with as tittle Irritation as possi. oie, out oi course no relaxation ot ine principle wbicb underlies It, and no weakening of tbe ssfe guards wbicb surround it, can be expected. Experi ence In Ita administration will probably suggest amendment of tbs method of Its execution, but I Ventura to bope wesballnsver again be committed to a system wbtcb distributes public positions pnrely as reward for partisan service. Doubts msy well be en tertained whetber our government could survive tbe strain of a continuance of Ibis system, wbicb npon every change of administration Inspires an Immense army of clslmsnls to office lay siege to tbe pstronsge of government engrossing tbs time of poblle officers wiin tbelr Importunities, spreading abroad tbe con tagion of tbelr disappointment aud filling tbe air wltb tbe tumult of tbelr discoutent, Tbe allurements of an immense number of offices and places exhibit, ed to tbe voters of lbs land and tbe promise of tbelr bestowal In recognition of partisan activity debaucb tbe snffrsge snd rob political action of its tbougbtful and deliberative character. Tbe evil would Increase wttb Iba multiplication of offices consequent npon our extension, and tbe mania for office holding grow, log from its ludolgence would pervade onr population so generally tbat patriotic purpose, tbe anpport of prluelple, tbe desire for the publlo good and solid, luds fur tbs nation's welfare would be nearly banish ed from tbe activity of our party oonteata and cause tbem to degenerate Into Ignoble, selfish snd disgrace ful strusgles for Iba possession or office and pul4lc place. Clvll-servtc reform enforced by law came none too soon to check tbe progress of demorsllxa tlon. One of Its effects uot enough regarded Is tbe freedom It brings to tbe political action of tboae con servallveand sober men wbo, la fear of tbe confu sion and risk attending an arbitrary and sudden change in all tbe public offlcsa wltb a change of parly rule, cast tbelr ballots against such a chance. Tar tlet seem to be necessary and will long contlnna to exist; nor can It now be denied tbat tbere are legiti mate advantages not disconnected wltb orSce-boldlog wblch follow party supremacy. While partlsanablp continues bitter and pronounced and supplies so much of moUre to sentiment and action, it Is not fair lo public omelets. In cbsrge ot Important trusts, responsible for tbe best reanlts In tbe performance of tbelr dutlea, to yet Inalst tbat tbey abal rely, In con fidential and Important places, upon tbs work of those not only opposed to tbem lo political affilia tion, but so ateepe-d in partlssn prejadice and rancor that tbey have no loyally to tbelr chiefs snd no desire for tbelr success, Ctru-tsrrice reform does not ex act this; nor does 11 require that those In subordin ate positions wbo fsll In yielding tbelr best service or wbo are Incompetent should be retained simply be es use they are in place.

To sabordloste tbese to the narrow sd. vsntsgsa of psrtlsansbfp or tbe aceompUsbment of selfish alms, Is to vlotste the people's trust and betray the people's IntereaU. But au Individual sense of responsibility on the part of each of us, and a stern determination to perform our dntv wslL must sire us place among those who hsve added in their dsy and generation to tb s glory and prosperity of our Le- tovea una. uuuvxut CLEVELAND. Samuel J, Tilden. from bis retreat at Grey atone, wrote last week a letter to Mr. Carlisle on tbe defenseless condition of our seaooast. Mr. Tilden aeee in the twelve ereat eeanorts of our oountry the appalling aum of $5,000,- uuu.uuu in property and tbe arteries or all our trade at the mercy of a foreign foe. He finds tbat we are In no oondition to resent ar rogance or to maintain the Monroe doctrine, and he see in the large revenues, the Indus trial condition ot tbe land, and tbe possess- ion of the government by the Democratic party a most ravorable opportunity for ex pending many millions for defense. The church of Latter Day Saint may be foroed to give up some of it stolen land aa well aa it pet institution of plural marriage. An agent of the interior department bas dis covered that the Mormons, acting under tbe direction of the late Brigham Young and one of his agent, wbo was recently sent to tbe penitentiary ror violating tbe Edmunds law. fraudulently pre-empted a large district in the Cache valley in 18G9 and then transferred tbelr claim to Young, who bad furnished money to pay entry tees. Young paid eath pre-emptor two bushels of wheat for his work. After his death the church took tho property, and for years it was called tbe Ohnn-h fi.n, " 1 it .

Tbere I a prett little ahlndy going on In Russian ofUolal oirclea, all beoause a peace ful German ateamer got into tbe harbor of Port Posslett, a town on tbe Pacifio coast in Uussia' Asiatic possessions, without getting blown to smithereens. Last spring while the Itusaian bear and tbe llritish lion were growling at each other so vigorously a double row or torpedoes were laid across tbe mouth of tbe harbor and tbey have not sinoe been removed. The danger algnal was not observ ed from the German vessel and aha steamed oyer the torpedoes just a aerenely and safely as though tbey bad been a lot of clams. And now Uussia wants to find out what was tbe matter with those torpedoes and what offioera are responsible for tbe bungling. Probably it will turn out tbat aome of tbem laid dum my torpedoes and profited by tbe swindle. Uussia swarms with offioera whose pockets take precedence of tbeir patriotism. Headers wbo wonld like a Uepublican news. f taper direct from tbe national capital will be nterested in tbe announcement, in our ad vertising columns, that tbey can have The Pboanix and the Weekly National Uepublican one year for only $2.

Cttcrmoni tmATTLEHOllOi ritlDAY, UECEMDElt 11, 1885. According to th latest Washington advices the ltepublloan senators will confirm all suit, able men appointed by the Administration to fill offloes where commissions have expired ; but In cases where officials have been remov ed for alleged cause, proof will be called for. Comment on the President's message from all sources aums np In this that it Is an ex ceedingly good ltepublloan document, Tbe New York Tribune, which of late bat dropped ita petty way of carping at everything that tbe President eaya or does, aptly tay of tbe message that It Is much lo the President's credit tbat "it it best and moat worthy ot commendation Juat where hit party la worst and Ita Infiaenoe most to be feared." Mr, Edmunds' refusal to accept tbe presi dency ot the Senate does not surprise hit Vermont friends wbo had previously been made acquainted wilb his view on the sub ject, llefore going on to Washington for the winter, tho Senator repeatedly said to these friends that he did not with the office, and that bis plaoe for the ootblng session waa on the floor of tbe Senate, to look after and ad vecate Important publlo measures, the charge of which be bad undertaken. Six children were bitten at Newark, N. J., last week Wedneaday by a dog supposed to be mad, and on Weduesday of this week they were all despatched by steamer to Paris for treatment by M. Pasteur, tbe hydrophobia expert, who claims to have discovered a rem. edy for tbat dreadful disease by inoculation. Tbe children were all from poor families and the money to pay their expenses, about $1000, was raised by subscription. A local physi cian went with tbem. Newark hat a serious hydrophobia scare and a secret society has been formed wltb tbe avowed otj ct of annl- bilating tbe canine specie. The president of tbe city board of health declare tbat the town ia filled with dogs in which rabies it de- veloplng, and tbat, unless something Is done to destroy tbe vsgrant animals, the most seri ous const ejuences are to be apprehended. The lr-ldeets'a 31 s"esge. The message of tbe President ia remarka ble for Its extreme length, yet in spite of this, or perhaps because of it, It It extremely readable. Time ia taken for argument and explanation, and tbe document has tbe merit of expressing the President's views in an un mistakable way. Senator Hoar was not wide of tbe maik when be said tbat tbe meaage was maiuly taken up with recommendations of Uepublicau measures. We will be sur prised if tbe opposition to many of tbe Pres ident's suggestions doe not come from hi own psrty. Tbe treatment of the Chinese question it admirable. Tbe existing law must be en forced, but tbere It to be no compromise with tbe hoodlum element of tbe Pacifio abates or with their allies in tbe east. The Chinese wbo are here must be protected. Hit comment on tbe anti Chinese riot ia tig nificant : "It is but just to say tbat tbey are traceable to tbe lawlessness of men not cltl zrni of tbe United Statet, engaged in com petition with Chinese labor. Itace prejudice ia the chief factor in originating tbeae dis turbances. In the same direction are the remarks on naturalization : "The privilege and franchise ot American citizenship should be granted wilb rare aud extended to those only wbo in- tend In good faith to assume ita duties and responsibilities when attaining Ita privilege and benefits. It should be withheld from those who merely go through the forms of natural ization with the iutsnt of escaping tbe dn tlea of their original allegiance without tak ing on tbemselvee tboae of tbeir new states, or wbo msy acquire the right of American citizenship for no other than a hostile pur- poae toward tbeir original governments. Those patriot who cherish tbe opinion tbat the chief end of the American republio ia to afford facilities for blowing up the tower of London must feel that tbelr bope of a vigor ous foreign policy was an Illusion. Tbe suggestions in regard to silver coinage deserve fuller notice tban can be given bere. Mr. Cleveland indulges in no official auiblg uity. He ft an outspoken opponent ot Ibe present law by which silver is being coined at tbe rate uf over $2,01X1,000 every month. He advocates tbe suspension of tbe coinage before gold is driven out ot circulation, as be predicts tbat it inevitably will he it tbe pre-eenl system Is continued. Tbe Indian question is treated in a way which shows a genuine desire for justice. The suggestion is made that a commission be appointed for a more careful investiga tion of tbe agencies and reservations. The paragraphs in regard to the Mormona would have been better if they had been condensed Into one or two sentences. Mr. Cleveland indulges in a homily on tbe Chris. tisn home, and all be saya is very true, but we would not blame a Mormon elder for smiling as he reads it. Civil service reform is treated clearly arfh concisely. Tbe President resfflrms bis be lief in tbe present law and his Intention to support it. At the same time he declare tbat it must not be made to shield the incom petent who may happen to be in office. "The civil aervice law does not prevent tbe dis charge of the Indolent or incompetent clerk, but it doea prevent aupplylng hit place with the unfit party worker." Wben we remember the difficulty in tecur Ing suitable successors to the retiring com. missionert we can appreciate tbe wisdom of tbe suggestion tbat tbe salaries of these offi cers be increased to a turn oommensurate to their Important functions. Tbe message was listened to with great at tention by the member of Congress, and the comments were for tbe most part favora ble. It will be notloed that tile message, while dealing largely with questions affecting the western etates, is silent in regard to the south. Not only Is the negro question Ig nortd, but no reference is made to tbe south ern etates as a distinct section In need of special legislation. JTaslin fttawraaiBBi for lraldestt prse Seska. At a caucus of Uepublican Senator held last Friday Gen. Logan was unanimously nominated for Prisident pro tern of the Sen ate, Mr, Edmunds presenting his name. Gen.
