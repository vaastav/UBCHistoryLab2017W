VERY LITTLE ATTRACTION But as the house was completely or y ganized at the extra session and all the committee assignments made then be yond the natural stimulus produced by the returning statesmen the regular hangerson of legislation and the lay ing of schemes by means of the third house or lobby Washington tonight is tranquil The programme at the house tomorrow is very simple and be yond the spectacular show which it offers to the curious has in itself little attraction The house will be called to order by the speaker who after the chaplains invocation will direct the clerk to call the roll This having been accom plished and the presence of a quorum demonstrated the clerk will be directed to notify the senate that the house is ready for business and a committee will be appointed to wait on the presi dent After that there will be a re cess to await the arrival of the presi dents annual message which will be read upon its reception and be followed by an adjournment until Tuesday BUSINESS OF THE SESSION This is the regular routine and un less something unforeseen occurs will not be departed from It is the inten 1k tion of the house leaders to proceed vith the business of the session as rap idb as possible The committees will be < Tin their labors this week and as all of them have more or less bills on hand which were Introduced at the extra session there will be no lack of ma i terial for the house to work on after the committee hoppers have begun to rind The appropriations committee has been at work for ten days and Chairman Cannon expects to pass at least two of the principal bills before the holidays the legislative executive and judiciary and the pension bills One or the other of these bills it is expect ed will be reported by Wednesday and the end of the week uromises to see the house down to business BANKRUPTCY BILL Among the early general measures to receive consideration is the bankruptcy bill Whether it will be the Nelson bill tvhich parsed the senate at the last ses sion or a modification of the Torrey bill depends upon the temper of the judiciary committee which will submit the measure to the house Beyond doubt there will be several resolutions 4 of inquiry during the first week which may be more or less sensational some of the radical proCuba members will i attempt to get consideration for a Cuban resolution before the foreign af fairs committee can act Congressman Livingston of Georgia is one of these I But owing to the nature of the house rules all these hasty efforts will prove abortive and the measures probably will take their course I IN THE SENATE There will be nothing except indis position on the part of members to prevent the senate entering promptly upon its work upon convening tomor row as there is a calendar already made for it with about 30 bills reported from committees during the special session If any circumstances should prevent the receipt of the presidents message on Monday the probabilities I are that the senate will adjourn over without taking up any other business until the message could be received With the message read it will re main with the senate to decide as to whether it shall seriously enter upon the work of the session after Monday or begin a system of delay intended to throw all important questions over be yond the Christmas holidays The in dications are now for a little more ac tivity than usual during the preholi day session This is largely due to the fact that the supporters of the adminis tration and advocates of annexation are very anxious to secure the earliest possible consideration with Hawaii 

HAWAIIAN ANNEXATION Senator Davis chairman of the com mittee on foreign relations announces his purpose of pressing annexation at the earliest possible moment but it is J I i probable that the matter will not be taken up riously until the committee can have a meeting and decide on the details of the procedure The commit tee willbe called together Wednesday for this purpose One point which the committee will be called upon to decide is whether to proceed to ratify the treaty of annexation or to annex the islands by resolution The annexation ists have lost some votes during the vacation and there is now apprehen sion that the twothirds vote necessary to assure the ratification cannot be se cured No satisfactory canvass is pos sible until the senators arrive and if it is then made manifest that the necessary twothirds vote cannot be secured it is likely that the proceeding by means of resolution which would I require only a majority vote will be in augurated Some members of the foreign rela tions committee who favor annexation I advocate this course because they say they see no reason for traveling the I same ground twice as they would be I compelled to do in case the matter should be first considered in executive session fail there and then be taken up in the form of a resolution in open sen ate and house IMMIGRATION The immigration bill for which Sen ator Lodge stands sponsor is prac tically at the head of the senate legis lative calendar and will be considered early in the session Senator Lodge today repeated his intention of press ing the bill but he will not antagonize the Hawaiian treaty with it The first bill on the calendar is Sen ator Gears measure providing for the adjustment of the Pacific railroad debt but the sale of the Union Pacific doubt less will have the effect of causing the temporary withdrawal ofthis bill and the substitution of others Of the 300 bills on the calendar about 200 are private pension bills and all of these probably will be disposed of at one sitting when taken up There are also several hundred recess appoint ments to be considered in executive session It is not probable that much will be done in the way of legislation the pres ent week There will be an adjourn ment for the day after receiving the message on Monday and there is no disposition to press the Hawaiian mat ter until the foreign relations com mittee agree upon a line of action The I indications are that it will not be taken up in the senate until next week FEDERAL HOSPITALS Interesting Reports On Leprosy Bu bonic and Yellow Fever Washington Dec 5Surgeon Gen eral Wyman of the marine hospital service submitted his annual report to Secretary Gage It shows that during I the fiscal year ended June 30 1897 the total number of patients treated at hospitals and the dispensaries con nected with the service was 54477 Al though the total number of patients treated was 673 in excess of those treated during the previous fiscal year the expenditures were 538536 which is 21000 less than the previous year i The number of immigrants inspected by officers of th s < > at the various I ports aggregated 232147 The appearance of cholera in Japan and China he says is now a matter i of greater moment to the United States I than at any previous time owing to the rapid growth of commerce between those countries and the Pacific coast Smallpox is reported as having ap I peared in 16 states between Nov 1 1896 and Nov 1 1S97 In the year pre vious it appeared in 22 states The prevalence of the bubonic plague in i the eastern hemisphere has offered a i new problem for the consideration of the health authorities of the United States The disease is reported as in creasing at present in northern India The report of the international lep rosy conference held in Berlin in Oc tober gives a somewhat imperfect statement of the number of cases of leprosy in the different countries of the world there being approximately 130000 in India 20000 in Japan 2500 in Hawaii 1200 in Russia 700 in Calcutta 250 in the United States The total number of cases of yellow fever reported to the bureau up to Nov 20 was 4198 and the number of deaths 423 Of these there were 1722 I cases and 244 deaths in New Orleans iFKINLEY AT THE

MANY IRONS IN THE FIRE ALREADY Hence She Is Not Prepared to Resist Any Move By Germany Forces For China the Largest She Ever Sent Beyond EuropeCabinet Crisis in Italy Berlin Dec 5When the German reenforcements consisting of four companies of marines numbering 23 officers and 1200 men and a company of naval artillery arrive at Kiao Chau bay for which point as already cabled they will soon set out they will bring the total German force there up to 4566 men the largest body Germany has ever sent beyond European wa ters It is understood that the re serves had to be drawn upon The admiralty denies that other Eu ropean squadrons have entered the har bor at KiaoChau to watch Germanys proceedings and it is believed that Ad miral von Diedrich would protest vig orously against such an attempt The Kolinsche Zeitung regards the expedition as having a twofold aim First to obtain missionary reparation and second to obtain the concession of KiaoChau as payment for past serv ices rendered China by Germany in connection with the conclusion of peace with Japan There is much selfcongratulation among the Germans that the mission ary incident absolves the government from the tedious and perhaps abortive process of diplomatically claiming a coaling station in the form of a demand for a treaty port or a settlement on perpetual lease It is believed unnec essary to take Great Britain into ac count as she is occupied elsewhere while Japan is not likely to resist the coalition of Germany Russia and France This is the contention of the Kol nische Zeitung At the same time it says that Germany will not be led by the allurements of France or Russia to deviate from a policy of moderation in China CRISIS IN ITALY Cabinet Likely to Resign Because of Army Abuses Rome Dec 5General Pellieux
