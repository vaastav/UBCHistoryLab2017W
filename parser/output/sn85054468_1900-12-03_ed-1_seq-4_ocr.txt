Sunday 170 excepted 3St Preparing- for the FIkIiI There is a refreshingly sturdy Anglo Saxon directness about the methods and movements of Senator Hanna that never fails to excite our admiration no matter how little wc may be pleased -with the ob jects of his activity Planning his winter descent upon the Capital for yesterday he took pains to have the other transporta tion magnates interested with him In the ship subsidy Job or their representatives here to meet him They were on hand and ready to go Into secret session as soon as the proprietor of Congress reached the hotel common to the party The seance was long and important and developed the point that Mr Hanna is de termined to jam the Subsidy bill through this winter to thecxcluslon of any other business Interfering with his purpose If opponents of the measure in the House had been wise they would have kept quiet until after the assembling of that body Frank expressions of an Intention to an tagonize it by Burton and other Western Republicans have given Mr Hanna his cue and he will not gie them a chance at his cherished job until he has carried it safely through the Senate Should Pettigrew attempt obstruction and succeed in making it effective then Mr Hanna is quoted as saying that a re sort to a cloture rule might be had In one way or another the idea is to hurry the bill through the upper house and then present it at the other end of the Capitol as a party measure opposition to which would be a violation of party regularity The Interesting statement Is made that as the matter Is of great moment to our mercantile marine the magnates who are to participate in the loot will be amp ly represented In Washington until the Victory has beca won Owing to the decision to begin the fight in the Senate there was widespread de pression yesterday among Representatives who bad just arrived and had therefore been without opportunity to listen to ar gumcntsln favor of the Henna scheme The sporting -end of the proposition -Right as far as the House rsccncerned and the Senate odds went correspondingly There are several cremely prosperous and brilliant gen men in town who are so thoroughly svlnced that a Subsidy bill will not be assed at the coming session that any eualorwho thinks differentlymight easily jet a bet on at about one dollar to fifteen thousand or possibly even better This is mentioned only by way of illustration The high moral tone which pervades our House of Lords precludes the idea that any of its members would wager or even fall before the temptatious advances of the stock ticker Just what course the Democrats in Con gress will adopt with reference to the job does not yet appear Probably opposition on their part will not be carried beyond the perfunctory stage It Is true that many people without regard to pirty re gard the measure as in contravention of public policy and altogether nefarious in design A law relieving vessels of foreign origin of the present inhibition against their American registry would produce all the relief needed by our merchant ma rine and It would be effected without cost to thenation The Hanna scheme on the - ill result In taxing

adepted Ing these things and also that there is practically unlimited money to talk for the aiHrmalivc side of the question pro tracted or filibustering opposition wouH accomplish nothing but a waste of time It will not take ten days to round up the necessary number of votes In the Senate as there does not appear to be any dispo sition on the part of the proponents to haggle or to evince anything but the most liberal sentiments What titty want is the law If they can have that they will be cordially willing to listen to sug gestions regarding details and It is prob ably safe to say that nobody was ever better able to remove doubts In the minds ot legislators or to present arguments more convincing than are the friends of the Hanna Subsidy bill In view cf thess conceded facts it would seem to be mere ly using up time and patience to make a straight party fight over the matter The Treaty With Mrarntcnn On Saturday Secretary Hay and Senor Correa Minister from Nicaragua signed a treaty by the terms of which the Nlca raguan Government cedes to that of the ITnlte States the rights and privileges nec essary for the construction by this country of the propoced Nicaragua Canal A like convention it Is understood will be en into with Costa Rica within a few nasmuch as the constitutions or Central American States in intcr Jiot permit alienation of national T the United States will be givcna of the required strip between the I In perpetuity Provision it is said ilso he made to take Nicaragua and J uu Rica Into partnership In a small y thould the canal be built thus strengthening our position In the direction 01 control Movements like these would seem to Im ply a desire on the part of the Administra tion to promote the Nicaragua project but appearances may ha decspUve It is quite s that the Nicaragua and Costa Rica rrtA nirm by play is in the Interests of the Panama syndicate and Intended for use by them as a club with which to extort better terms for themseives from the French holders of two hundred million dollars par value ot old Do Lesseps securities The Panama scheme is hardly if at all feasible but it is rotten and complicated and If the na tion can be worked into backing it and buying out the Administration clique who are Jobbing it it is much superior to the rival project as a subject of easy loot The Panama lobby is one of the most magnificent in personnel and generosity that baa j jver been seen in Washington It has been so far working quietly as its principal arguments are too refined In character to be shouted on the street cor ners llut it Is operating industriously and Intelligently and withnnd by means that atmostiinvariably have led to success in matters of legislation since Mr McKin leys ajlvent to the White House The method lof play adopted by the Panama lobbyists is shrewd As yet they are not attacktpgthe Nicaragua project in the open trnt are vigorously pushing the Hay Paujjcifbte Treaty rightly arguing that with that infamy fastened on the caeiutry people who hate been demanding an ex clusively American Nicaragua Canal will be too disgusted to care further about the route and may be Indifferent to the sad dling upon us of the exploded French scheme There is good politics in this Idea but not as much as in the main one namely that given millions enough one can get anything through a Republican Congress The lobby has the millions within easy reach That being conceded the remainder of the story should be able to tell Itself Drop the nickel in the slot and tho ma chine will work automatically Democrat anil lie Army mil A caucus of House Democrats has been called for this afternoon to take into con sideration the Root Army Reorganization bill What the result of the meeting may be we cannot say but wehopc that ft may be something sensible What with a work ing majority and the Reed rules to for tify them the Republicans are entirely capable ot forcing through in short order any measure upon which they can agree among themselves A large permanent standing army is opposed to Democratic principles and traditions but the people declared for one at the polls last month and we assume it to be good Democratic octrine that they arc entitled to what they call for Many members of the opposition it Is said fat or offering a measure extending for a term of jears the present organiza tion of the army as a substitute for the bill which will Le reported by the Military Committee Whether this course shall be adopted or not is a matter of small mo ment We are unable to see where the Democrats have tho smallest chance to defeat or even obstruct the Administra tion design Since it is certain that an army reor ganization bill will become a law at the 1 resent session it might be patriotic and useful if Democrats would address them seles to some features of the bill which possibly might be amended to advantage The political pull of the old Chinese staff organization has already resulted In over setting most of Secretary Roots recom mendations regarding the Introduction of a sclentffic stiff system In our service It is staged that Mr Hulls committee has been induced to add the ordnance branch to thetatf departments whose officers are to bejpermanent Probably by the time the measure is well before the House It will reek of political corruption and fav oritism as most Republican propositions do but as we have reminded the oppo sition that will not hinder its passage They might as well sit in the galleries as on the floor for anything they can do to stop the march of the triumphant ele phant Amerlcnn IZxiinrtn ta Cermniir According to a report recently mado to the Government by Consul Oeiicril Mason at Berlin the average annual in crease of population in Germany is now about eight hundred thousand souls a year The fact that these rapidly ex panding masses arc largely dependent upon American foodstuffs is causing anx iety among Teutonic economists who fear that the match of American trade into the Fatherland presages German economic dependence upon the United States to an extent opposed to tho interests and proper policy of the Kmplre There have been very heavy increases during the past Jive years in our exports to Germany of timber and lumber wheat t 515 iron pork and fresh IDuii would haraiy uet With all the efforts that the agricul tural class have made to supply the food demands of Germany from home produc tions tbc statistics of the semi decade 1SS3 UM show that 81 per cent of the total consumption of rye 230 per cent of wheat 20 of barley and C2 of oats must be obtained from other countries Trade conditions in Germany arc fair Her compctlIon with Gieat Britain cen in British markets has been successful and her laboring classes are better paid and fed than ever before German agri culture has not kept pace with the expan sion of German industry jcrhaps can never catch up with it The proposition to deprive the masses of cheap and whole some food by building tariff walls against Imports Is a vicious one and borrowed from the economically indefensible fiscal system of this country It would be far better for Germany to make all food ele ments free as Ungland has for a long time and with great advantjge to her prosperity Alger has come out In an InlerWcw In praise and endorsement of Cagan There is nothing now for the lat ter to ask of anyone

TIMFS WASHINGTON MONDAf DECEMBER 3 1900 THE SHIP SUBSIDY BILL Ailmlnintrntlon Influence- to Be tried In Ita Behalf Apparently there lsno longer room for doubt that the full power of the Adminis tration will be exerted in behalf of the Hanra Paync ship subsidy scheme at the session of Congress which convenes today As told by The Times yesterday Senator Frye has agreed at Mr Hnnnas urgent solicitations to call up the bill cither Tuesday or Wednesday and fight to make it a special order If this is accomplished the ship subsidy scheme will have the right-of-way of all legislation this winter except the regular appropriation bills and if Mr Hanna succeeds In forcing it through the parly caucus every Republi can in the Senato will be compelled to fight for it It is known that four or five Republican Senators from the West arc opposed to the measure and that they would very much like to see it defeated These Senators it Is believed will fight Mr Hanna bitterly in the caucus though if iney lose there of course they will have to yield gracefully on the floor of the Senate to the party dictates It is settled almost beyond per adveuturc that the President in his message will strongly advo cate the ship subsidy scheme and that he will artfully direct attention to the fact that it was endorsed In the last Republican platform It is expected that thU will have the desired effectupon quite a number of Western Republicans in both branches of Congress who arc afraid of the bill The fact that Mr McKinley while a member of tbc House frequently opposed measures of the same character Is being cited as possible evidence that he is not favorably inclined toward the Hanna bill despite the declaration In the Philadelphia platform The statement is also made by numerous friends of the President that he recently has intimated to them a desire for the defeat of the bill But this theory of Presidential opposition is destroyed utterly not only by the close relations known to exist between Mr McKinley and Mr Hanna but also by the well known fact established Indisputably by Porto Kican legislation at the lau session that the Presidential mind Is open to convic tion even up -to tho very last minute It will bo recalled that in his last message to Congress Mr McKinley based his strong plea for free trade for Porto Rico upon the ground of plain duty but that before the session was three months old he called innumerable- Western members and Senators to the White House and ask ed them to vote for the Oxnardized tariff bill It is accepted then as settled that the President in his message will recommend the bounty legislation demanded by Mr Hanna and others interested in the ship ping trade Moreover It is believed that Mr McKinley has been laboring earnestly with Speaker Henderson in behalf of the measure General Henderson like most Westerners has usually opposed all legis lative bounty schemes and his conduct at the last session seemed to indicate that he was particularly antagonistic to the Hanna Paync bill If he Is still opposed to that measure he can so use his power as Speaker as to defeat it On the contrary If he has been won over to Its support by the President the Speaker can force the bill through the House with little or no trouble General Henderson of course wants to be re elected Speaker and it goes without say ing that Mr Hanna and Mr McKinley can defeat him if they want to It was they who made his election sure before the present Congress even assembled in Washington and they will certainly have quite as much influence with the next House as they have with this Where fore It is contended that If General Hen derson does not permit the adoption of a rule whereby the Ship Subsidy bill can be forced through the House with celerity In spite of all opposition it will be a sign that he has decided not to ask- for re election to the Speakership As it is con sidered scarcely he would forego this ambition It Is generally be lieved that he will give Rcpresentathc Grosvenor all the assistance needed to give the shipping bill the necessary ad vantage over all other legislation That a thorough understanding has been reached ail around as to the Ship Subsidy bill is shown by the rise during the past few days in Pacific Mail stock A few vceks before the elcctlonthis stock took a sudden upward bound and reached 52 and a fraction from 32 and a fraction It sagged backward soon after the election and two or three days ago was down to 40 It is an open secret in Wall Street that on Mr Hannas tip scores ot Republican leaders made big money out of the rise in Pacific Mall stock before tho election It has been learned since that the rise in the stock by which Mr Hannas friends were enriched was due to two potent causes One of them was Mr Hannas assurance to certain financial interests connected with the Southern Pacific Rail road that Mr McKinley would be re-elected and the other was that upon this as surance a deal was made whereby the re lations between the Southern Pacific Com pany and the Pacific Mull Company al lied concerns by the way became more Intimate Indeed the new managers of tho railroad bought outright a large block of Pacific Mall securities Stock market experts contend that knowledge of this transaction should of -- HKflHc Mail stock up to shipping interests 101 iw a agreeing upon a programme for forcing through the Hanna laync bill at this ses sion of Congress Pacific Mall took an other upward shoot Now that the terms of the agreement ais Known and it Is aUo eiidcnt that the President Is doier inined to aid Mr Hanna in pushing the bill through It is expected that Pacific Mali will keep going up rapidly until it reaches the figure touched before elec tion Mr McKinleys avowed hesitancy absut inserting a paragraph In his message against the trusts is pointed out as an other factor in the erratic lnorcmrnls In tho stock market during the nast few days including the swing backward and forward of Pacific Mall If Wall Street were certain that the President did not intend to hit the trusts nearly nil in dustrials whose speculative alue Is based ho largely upon the concentration of wealth now In progress would show a firmer tone than they hac exhibited for a week The semi official announcement sent out from Washington last night that Mr McKinley had written a paragraph against the trusts hut possibly wonM not insert It In his message is expected to have the desired effect upon the slock market today and it Is conceded that If the gentlemen who profiled by Mr Han nas Pacific Mali tip before the election arc wise they will not let tills opportuni ty pass to add materially to their bank accounts In point of fact it Is alleged thaL lienvv buying orders were placed late Saturday afternoon by tho same group of favored Republican leaders as got in on the ground floor In the recent Pacinc Mail deal Whether they Knew that the Presi dent was hesitating about inserting the anti trust paragraph in his message Is not known On tho other hand it is ton tended that the annoiicement of Mr Mc Kinleys hesitancy on the trust question was wholly unwarranted and that It was made solely for the purpose of strength ening the bull side of the market At any rate the foregoing Is 1 fair outline of the chnractcr of Isilk and gos sip yesterday among legislator lobby ists and others interested in the work of the session of Congress that begins to day For the first time In more than twenty years surmise and speculation as to the work of Congress hinge almost wholly upon alleged deals in thn stock market

POPES ENCLYCLICAL Ieo XIII11 End of the Century Ad dreaa to the Faithful NEW YORK Dee 2 There has Just been received here from Rome a copy ot the Popes encyclical on Jesus Christ the Redeemer The encyclical is Intended by the Pope as an end of the century address by him to the Catholic faithful In this country the Bishops will transmit the en cyclical to their priests who in turn will read It to the people Although it is nnt possible the Pope says to look to the future without anx iety and the dangers to be feared are neither light nor fev the sources of evil private and public being so many and so inveterate still through Gods goodness the end of the century seems to afford rome ground for hope and comfort At a single sign from tho Roman Pontiff a great multitude of pilgrims thronged Home during the Holy Year Who asks thfl Pope fnM fnllfnha ihavmI by this spectacle of extraordinary devotion to ward the Saviour Would he says that those flames of the old Catholic piety which had as It wcreheen bursting forth developed Into a great fife and that the excellent example set by many pilgrims might move the rest of the world The Pope asserts that If they recognized that nothing could be more wretched than to have left the Redeemer of the world and abandoned Christian customs and teach ings surely all would arise and changing their courte seek to escape certain ruin To preserve and extend the kingdom of God on earth is the office of the Church and now that special opportunities are of fered during tho holy year the knowl edge and the love of Jesus Christ should be more largely diffused by teaching persuas ion and exhortation directed not so much to those who listen attentively as to all those unhappy ones who while retaining tho Christian came spend their lives with out faith and without the love of Christ Christs law tho Pope says must be sought absolutely from the Church and accordingly as Christ Is the way for men so also is the Church be of himself and by his nature she by tho ofilce conferred on her and the communication cf power Therefore contends th Pope whosoever look for salvation outside of the Church have gone astray and are laboring In vain Tho case he says Is almost the same with States as with Individuals they too must end disastrously If they depart from the way The Pope next declares that by a con fusion of Ideas both rulers and subjects have been led away from the true path for they needed what was wanting a sure guide and support And he asks do we not every day see States which have la bored hard to ensure an increased public prosperity distressed and suffering in many respects and these of the highest importance True It is asserted that civil -society suffices for itself that It can get on well enough without the aid of Christian insti tutions and attain Its end by Its own ef forts alone Hence It Is sought to laicise 1 tne work or public administration so that the traces of the ancient religion are daily becoming fewer in civil affairs and public life But the Pope says those who are responsible for this do not perceive well enough the effects of what they are doing For the idea of God judging what is good and what is evil being given up the laws must lose their chief authorlty and justice collapse two bonds of the strongest kind which are essentially nec essary to human society In like manner says the Pope when the hope and expectation of eternal happiness have disappeared there 13 a disposition to thirst eagerly for earthly goods and every one endeavors by all the means in his power to grab as much of them as he can for himself Hence arise jealous rivalry envy hatred then horrible schemes the desire to abolish ail power the design to create mad ruin everywhere No tranquil lity abroad no security at home evil so ciety disfigured by crime Christ the Lord must be restored to human society as to his possesion Ail the members and1 parts of the social organization roust draw and drink from the fountain ot life which proceeds from him the legal enactments the national in stitutions the universities and schools the marriage laws and the family the pal aces ot the wealthy and the workshops ot the tollers And let it be borne in mind that upon this largely depends that civili zation of the nations which is so much de sired The Pope begs of ail Christians to do what they can to know theirRedeemer as be is and he especially anneals to the clergy to exert their zeal for this purpose as far as possible in the pulpit and the schools and wherever opportunity offers STOPPED A RUNAWAY

HOTEL CORRIDORS I shall Introduce in the House tomor row a bill to -cut down the Southern Cca gressional representation said Represen tative Crumpacker of Indiana atWIIIarda last night I think this question is of a great deal more importance than either the Ship Subsidy bill or the Nicaragua Canal bill Under the provisions of my bill tho South will lose thirteen votes at the start and perhaps many more when It Is proper ly operated I see no reason why certain Southern States should be allowed Con gressional representation In district where they have disqualified the negro Toter In order to get at the exact repre sentation to which they are entitled we will rely largely upon the census returns rrom tbeso returns we can figure out the total number of disqualified negro voters and thus have a basU upon which to figure out the representation to be allowed North Carolina will lose four Representa tives under the provisions of my bill South Carolina Mississippi and Louis iana will each lose three This bill ia not introduced u3 a party measure It Is for the purpose of keeping out of Con gress such Representatives as are not entitled to seats I shall push the meas ure to the limit and am confident that it will pass at this session Representative Grosvenor of Ohio is registered at the Dewey He is a strong supporter of the Ship Subsidy bill and predicts its passage He says there will be no opposition to the bill when it cornea before the House but he thinks some little difficulty will be experienced In ths Senate He does not explain the nat ro or this opposition but says it will not te of sufficient importance to Injure the measure The bill he says Is just what Is needed and will go a long way In building up the shipping interests in this country The Central West will favor the pas sage ot tho Nicaragua Canal bill slid W F Paxton of Paducah Kr at th Rlgg3 Mr Paxton Is president of tho Citizens Savings Bank of Paducah Tha passage of this bill he continued will be a great help to the Central West It means that we will enlarge our factories that our rivers will be made mere navi gable and that we will be able to ship goods to foreign ports directly from our own city This means business for U3 That Is what we want TTe hope the till will go through Representative Dck of Ohio was in tha lobby of the Arlington last night and was greeted by many of his friends and politi cal colleagues The Ohio State Chairman of the Republican Executive Commtttco was seemingly as much flushed with tho success of the recent campaign as is Sena tor Hanna whom Mr Dick called en last night The latter denied that the Repub lican boss had any yearning for the Presi dency In 1001 Mr Hanna does not lake that matter seriously and I am inclined to believe that he Is sincere In asking bis friends not to encourage it said he Nevertheless the letters and despatches received regarding it are all sincere Mr Hanna is getting along to an age where he would tegard a Presidential nomination as more or less of a burden He does not consider himself capable of such a big task Were he a younger man and had this opportunity come to him twenty years ago It would be another matter A things stand at present I have no idea that he would give the matter any serious thought There Is no doubt but that to would make a good President In the last campaign people began to appreciate the man at his real worth Four years ago hi3 popularity was nothing to what it Is now The country has Jii3t awakened to his usefulness and he is recognized as a man of great qualities of remarkable in sight and undaunted courage He dees not stop at obstacles and his manner is always direct The straightesfway Ishis way If he wants to be chairman of the National Committee again he can have the position without asking for It but I hardly think he will want It There will be many changes in all of us in fonr years time j Reprcscnlativc Achson of Pennsyl vania who was at the Raleigh for a short time last night is of the opinion that M S Quay will be defeated In hi3 fight to be returned to the United States Senate You see said he last night it is now known that Mr Quay will not have more than 123 votes when the State Legislature meets In January to select a Senator The only thing that saved him from a landslide was the fact that this is a Presi dential year Had It been an oft year he would have been signally defeated at the polls To show what I mean take Mercer County Here McKinley had a majority of 1800 while there was only a majority of 52 for Colonel Quay In another county McKinley had 3000 ma jority while Quay had but 200 It was the McKinley wave that saved Quay by sweep ing votes to him I have no idea who will be elected In opposition to him- There are a large number of candidates and it will be an anti Quay man It might be Charles Emory Smith or Representative Dalzell or John Wanamaker All of these have a ood chance as has P A B Widener I do not think Mr Quay can muster onough votes to carry him through although he claims to have 15S fissured An anti Quay man or an In s 11 i c v atorship u i i n i j er Mo j be ai re 1 R c r m mini vvus removed to the nospttal
