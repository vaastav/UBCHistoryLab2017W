ALEXANDRIA, VA. THUBS DAY EVENING, DECEMBER 10. Now that the democrats in Congress are assured by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury and by the message of the Presi dent that they will have the powerful as sistance of both those important and influ-1 ential governmental functionaries in their efforts'to reduce the revenue to an amount just sufficient to meet the expenses of a reformed aud economically administered government, they should at once inaugurate measures which, if carried through, will effect that object, and should persist therein incessantly, with no let or hindrance, until they shall have done all that cau be done toward attaining a consummation so de voutly desired. Of course, they will be op posed by the republican?, and by a few mis called democrats', but they should show the people of the country tbat if they had pos session of oil the branches of tbe govern- j xneafc'ihey would reform the tariff upon a j ""' revenue basis, limit the taxes to an amount that would uot exceed the actual needs of the country, romove the duties on the nec essaries of life, and thereby diminish, b}' one half, the present cost of living; and that the only thing between them and the bless ing referred to is the opposition of the re publicans and of the few anomolous demo crats to whom refercuce has been made. This is a country in which, nominally, all men, except the Chinese, are guaranteed equality of opportunity, and where special favors are granted to noue, but the existing high tariff proves that practically the equal ity referred to is a myth, and that there is a small specially favored class?the protect ed manufacturers. Let the democrats in Congress make it so plain that the way faring man may see that they are opposed to the oontinuauco of such an outrage upon the spirit of free iustitulious. Several measures have already been introduced in the Legislature relating to the State debt, but, unfortunately for the best interests of tho State, the purpose of all of them is the same?to strengthen the repudiation legislation previously enacted. All the means that many poor widows in Virginia have with which to pay taxes on their impoverished homes aro tho coupons of the bouds left them by their fathers or husbands, who accepted them in good faith. But the able bodied men of tbe State now say tbat coupons shall be repudiated, and that the widows referred to shall pay their taxes in mouey or have their homes sold over their heads. Virginia does not occupy an enviable position now either at home or abroad. ___ General Mahone and his few Northern sympathisers still harp upon the utterly groundless and long exploded story of bull dozing and fraud at Virginia elections. And yet of the eight democratic members of Con gress from Virginia, tho seat of not a siogle one is contested. Every sensible man at all acquaiutod with Mahoneism, is perfectly convinced that if there had been the slight est conceivable ground upon which to base a contest, it would have been availed of, if for no other purpose than to get the pecu niary allowance tbat is always made for bona fide contestants. 

VIBGINIA NEWS. Two hundred and fifty miners are on a strike at the Bluo Stone mines, near Poca hontas. It reported that an effort is being made by the strikers to get the men at Po cahontas to join them. The dwelling house of Mrs. Virginia Yel lott, on her farm near Wheatland, in Lou doun county, was wholly consumed by fire, about 9 o'clock last Monday morning, together with nearly all the household goods. At the annual meeting of the stockhold ers cf the Richmond and Danville Railroad Company, held in Richmond, yesterday, the report of the President and Directors was submitted, showing the gross earnings for the past year to have been $3,981,355.07, operating expeuses $2,23L,4S6.26. Col. A. S. Buford was re-elected President. The democratic caucus of the members of the Legislature last night renominated the following officers: Auditor, Col. Morton Marye; second auditor, F. G. Ruffin; regis ter of the land office, Andrew J. Wingfield; secretary of the Commonwealth, H. W. Flournoy. The contest between J. R. Barksdule, the present incumbent, and A. W. Harman, of Rockbridge couuty, for State treasurer, resulted ia tho nomination of Mr. Harman by a close vote. An Elephant Kills a Lion.?The watchman at the winter quarters of Fore paugh'a menagerie, Frankford, near Phila delphia, was startled about 8:80 o'clock yes terday morning by a terrific roar from the direction of the lion and elephant section of the building. He rushed to the place and was horrified to find a large and ferocious Asiatic lion engaged in a mutual combat with a gigantic and furious African elephant. Just as the keeper arrived he beheld the lion crouched ready to spring upon his an tagonist. The elephant seemed to be await ing the onslaught. Before the alarmed and excited man could call for assistance or se cure a weapon to prevent tho encounter, the lion sprang on the elephant, clawing and tearing her in a frightful manner. The latter, however, soon found an opportunity to use her immense tusks, which she ran completely through the body of her assail ant, killing him almost instantly. The lion's dying roar could be heard for squares, and was appaling. Some lime eiapsed be fore the dead animal could be unfastened and the elephant's tusks withdrawn. When this was accomplished the latter's passion subsided. The elephant, though seriously injured, will probably survive. Court or Appeals Yesterday.?Walton against Williams. Argued for appellees. 

FBOM WA8HINGTOB. [Special Correspondence of the Alexa. Gazette.] Washington, D. C., Dec. 10,1885. From prominent Virginia republicans now in the city?it is learned.that the Ma honeitea "they call themselves republicans now?in the Legislature of their State will probably neither nominate nor vote for a candidate for U. S. Senator. They have only 40 members of that body, and dou'ithink it worth while to pay any man in their party the worthless compliment of voting for him. It is also learned from thesame sources that the party is of the impression that,political ly, General Mahone is no better than u dead man, and that the party will be reorganized, leaving him among the rank and tile, and bringing the old and recently spurned and neglected leaders of the party to tin- front. They say they are considerably di>li?ured, but are still in the ring, and will make a better fight next fall under different leaders than tbey have made under Mahone in their last three campaigns. Among the new appointments under the new doorkeeper of the House, Mr. Donel son, is that of Capt. John A. Jonr?. The Captain is a good and true working demo crat, and is a leading member oJ the Vir ginia democratic association of this city. He was conductor on ihe Virgiuia Midland Railway for twenty sears, and after 'hat was passenger ag?*ut for the same road, which position ho held until last .July, when he resigned. Master William P.-.niter! of Richmond, sou of the ex chief of police of that city, hae been appointed one of the. 34 pages of the House. The political status of Senator Riddlebcr ger is a matter of some speculai ion hero now. The Senator's health, as previously stated, is greatly improved, and he is now au attentive observerof the Senate'sproceedings. Hedoes not attend the republican caucus, says the future will determine his politics, and this morning wont so far as to say that probably he bad not done turning. Some of the democrats who still like bi'rn, notwithstand ing his recent politics, Pay his heart was never with the republicans, and that they are sure he will como back to his okl party. In the sudden and eventful changes in mod ern American politics it may bo that tho Senate may havo it in his power, as Ma hone had four years ago, to chauge the po litical complexion of the Senate 'two vc-ars hence. Should that be so, his friends refer red to say they are sure he will turn it over to the democrats. His enemies, however and he has many, still say he is joined to his idols, and will remain with them to tho end. Nothing more is heard of the House committee chairmanships to day except, that Mr. Curtin will ? be reappointed chairman of the committee on Foreign Relations. J1 or the armv committee Mr. Bragg, the man who Paid in the national democratic convention, *'we love Cleveland for the enemies ho has made," is mentioned as tho probable chairman. Gen. Bragg has been out of Congress for tome years, and when there before had little use for bis democratic colleagues. An|attempt was made to get enough names in the House to call for a democratic caucus on the subject of tho proposed change in the rules of that body, but it did not succeed, or at least has not as yet succeeded, aa the members seem disposed to let. the Commit tee on rules, to whom the change alluded to has been referred, make their report, i<ud to discuss that report in the House. Now that the Congressmen have had time to read and reflect upon the President's message, many of the democrat* anion them are open in their disapprobation of his views on civil service, and it is already intimated that a strong effort will be made either to modify or repeal the existing law. It is generally believed among the mem bers of Congress, democrats as well as repub licans, that the administration will be con ducted more in accordance with the views of Mr. Randall than those of Mr. Carlisle, and that the former's influence is potential at the White House. The House was not in session today' having adjourned yesterday until Safnrdny' when the subject of the proposed chauge in the rules will probably be again considered In the Senate to-day there was another flood of bills, tho most of which will never be hoard of again. Mr. Allison moved that when the Senate adjourned it should be until Monday, but withdrew it at tho in stance of Mr. Beck, who said it was impor tant that some nominations should ho acted upon. Attorney General Blair, of Virginia paid a flying visit to this city last night. ' Petitions aro in circulation asking Con gress to make au appropriation for a homo for indigent ex-Confederates. The whole movement is iu the hands of thoso who were opposed to the South during the war. The appropriation is asked for as a measure of grace. As few, if any, ex-Confederates have any thing to do with it, it cau afford no shi?rt gr?Und f?r moro u aviu8 of the bloody A large number of nominations somo of the many made during the recess of Con gress, were sent to tho Senate to-day. A petition asserted to be from the farmers of Iowa will be presented to tho House asking for the continued coinage of the sil' ver dollar, the continued issue of gold and silver certificates, and of making t heir de nomination as small as one dollar, and the continued issue and reissue of the one and two-dollar greenbacks, and for pa>ing tho ^rvC as eo?n as possible. Tho prevailing impression now is that tlm Congressional Cbjistmas recess will be from the 20th lnst. to the oth proximo, and that tho House SSSiPt0" A"0t annouacod until after tho w fw 3?understood that owiug to the fact that so few of the old coramitteo chairmen were ro-clected,there will be many changes anions ! those who-were returned, and that the difficulty I o. arranging the committees will be increased by ! the proposed change in tho rules, which will necessitate the appointment of certainmen to other than those on which tliey would otherwise have been retained. seSiVenPf?fri!odibyi-b0S0 wIl? have conversed with f leading republican Senators that mauy of the appointments mado bv the President daring the Congressional rcccsn "will fall either K ?Z thc,/lilar()of tho Senate to act upon them beforo adjournment.

Taking" the helm at an hour wheu dark clouds lowered over the fortunes of the democratic party ofthis State, he brought to bear in his man agemant of the political campaigns in Virginia, those rare executive qualities that enabled him j in each encounter with Mahono to defeat him, and finally, as the reward of his last effort, to be hold Virginia disenthraled, and once nioro deliv- j ered into the keeping of the democratic partr. Ic j may be said that the people were ripe for tho j change, and that any other man could have ac- j complished the same result. That may be?but i no other man did do it, and Mr. Barbour, we all i know, had had several excellent predecessors in ; the chairmanship. It was in recognition of these i labors in behalf of Virginia and the democratic j party,that* large proportion of the members of that party thought It would be a proper and a grace ? j ful thing to award himthe scalp he had taken in j honorable political warfare, and crown with Sen- j atorial honors thedeclining years of the old man's j existence." / THE

LETTER FROM RICHMOND. (Correspondence of tho Alexandria Gazette.) Richmond, Va., Dec. 9.?The resolution introduced in tho House by Mr. Hoge, of Patrick, asking Virginia'?, representatives in Congress to do all in their power towards having repealed the internal revenue tax on liquor and tobacco, was adopted without a spcech being needed upon tho subject. Many members did not know the resolution had been passed until after tho motion io reconsider had been refused. Several mem bers bad speeches to make on the subject, but it went throng:', ho quick and easy that they were not permitted to unload their eloquence. It would have been opposed by several ntembers bad they been in their seats or knew what was going ou at the time. The spirit of the resolution would not have been attacked, but the propriety of its introduction at this particular lime, when the turiil' question is assuming such gigantic proportions, would have been ques tioned. ... The Senate has intimated its intention to investigate the mutter of freight and pas scnger rates, and to ascertain whether auy railroads in th- commonwealth are making uniust'diserimination in charges. This is an important subject, particularly to com mercial men in the larger cities ot tho State, and thoso places wheto unjust discrimina tion is kuown to exU will send delegations here to urge the necessity of an immediate correction of it. Delegate Mayo, of Westmorelanu, was reported to have said soon after tho elec tion tiia', the Legislature would not see much of him. He has not been in his seat for several days, and bus made a pretty good start towards escaping the gaze of the Virginia lawmakers. Hois the leader of his party in the House, and when absent both parties miss him. Several republicans have expre-sseu a willingness to vote for ?omo of the men nominated for county judges at the election to-morrow, and at their caucus to-night they will not. make nominations for all the countie.-, but will give several tho go-by and will rally to the endorsement of a few democratic judge*. Mr. Tom Martin, of Albemarle, who was at tho head of i lie Daniel campaign in the Senatorial fight, was at the Capitol to-day. He managed so well for Daniel that be has remained to try his hand on Treasurer Barksdfsle, who comes from Albemarle, and who is strongly opposed by Mr. Harman, of Rockbridgp. Mr. Martin is a young man, and has already made $40,000 by practicing law. He is a born politician, except that he will not under any circumstances accept an office or allow any candidate to pay his expenses while he is pulling tbo political wires in the interest ot a friend.

KEV7S OF THE DAY. It is stated that the President lia.s deter mined to make no more appointments for awhile. # A movement is on foot among ox-Union soldiers to induce Congress to establish homes lor disabled ex-Confederates.

SURGERY has achieved a great triumph in Germany. Eleven years ago Professor Nussbaum, of Munich, took charge of a boy so malformed and crippled that he was obliged to crawl about on all fours. Nine serious operations were per formed, four crooked bones were broken, three stiff joints forcibly extended, several sinews cut through and nerves stretched. Weights were then attached to ceriain muscle3, and by means of massage baths, ointments and electricity so much progress was made that in a few years the boy was able to walk erect with the aid of crutches and a special apparatus fastened to hi> feer. Subsequently he was able to throw away this apparatus and exchange his crutches for a cane, and to-day he is a healthy, vig orous youth, able to walk, dance and ride on horseback. -o Gilded fivo cents are eoing for five-dollar j gold pieces, but Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup needs no gilding to make it go. OPINION OF JUDGE HUGHSS. In the United States Circuit Court in Rich mond yesterday Judge Hughes filed his opin ion ;n the case of tbi. Norfolk Trust Com i pany against Auditor Marye. The case was this: The Auditor assessed j tha Vorfolk Trust Company for back taxes I since 1874, amounting to $817.80. The Tryst ?

A suit by a citizen n.-rninst an ollicor of a Stato to require obedicnce to a jaw of the State is not a suit against the Stat heraclf, oven though she he directly interested in the result. ?? Kven if this W!-ro a suit against the btate ot Virginia, it is no objection tu tho jurisdiction of 1 the circuit courts of the United btntes in cases ' aming under the Constitution ami laws of the 1 United states that one of the partsu? is a Slate I and the otbsr cilizcu of t int State. i '1 lie State of Virginia lias a ris;ht to require i all coupons tendered in pnymont of taxes to be Vtrifled in accordance with the act of A.-:scnibij of January 14, 1SS12. which requires the tax re vivor on "the tender' of coupons to do athruiative ly several things by which the proceeding for the judicial verification of the coupons is instituted. It is tli* State through ;ho tax receiver who is required to take steps noccssary to the inaugura tion of th" pmcecdiugs. lf< therefore, the otlicer refuses outright to receive the i oupons, he de prives the taxpayer of the only means of judicial ly* verifying the coupon" tendered for taxes ?he caso falls within the decision iu Poindexter vs. Greenhow (IJ 1 U.

The case of M.iyic against Parsons, decided by the Supreme Conr. in April, which was niado up by the request oi this couit, and was sent up by it to be heard with other cases i n March last, decide j nothing exceft that a coupon holder w'n.j is not a'ses-ed for taxe3 has but a right or contract in tbe-e, and, therefore, i? uotontitled to tho injunc tion nroioss of the court to protect his right.

The Late Mr. Sharon.?This silver mil lionaire, this old roan who had run such an astonishing career, died- here where n large part of his millions were invested and yet his death had uo influence on every-day life and caused no general regret. A broker and man-about-towu, who runs against all kinds of people, said in talking of Sharon's death and funeral: "You would be surprised to know how few real friends Sharon had. He was kindness itself to his immediate relatives and to those attendants and employees who were faithful to him; but outride of these and the half dozen busi ness associates with whom ho put up mining deals and carried on other transactions for getting the better of his fellowman, he had absolutely no strong friends. Tho long divorce trial hampered bim with an arrov of leeches who-c lidelitv was a matter of coin-payment and who looked upon bim as simply n fine subject for blood sucking. Although Sharon lay dying for two weeks, suffering terribly except when under tho influence of opiates, I never heard a word of sympathy expressed for hitn. Around tho stock market he was one of the most cordially hated men you could (ind. The simple truth was that for the last ten years he ha3 been wrecking mining com panies and ruining the holders of the stock. This he has carried on so systematically that thousands of people traced their heavy 1 Oases to him. He broke down the price of stock remorselessly, and froze out the small holders who may have been clinging to their stock for several years in the hope that some thing would be done to develop tho mine. Sharon never developed anything unless ha could rend his title clear to nine-tenths of the profits. Hence, many of tho people who were frozen out by heavy assessments, often as much as the stock wa9 selling for in the market, had tho mortification of see ing tho shaies boomed a lew weeks after and carried up to a respectable figuro. Could a man escape being hated who was in this business?"?San Francisco letter in St. Louis Globe-Democrat. Flying Machines.?The study of the flight of birds and insects has of Jalo years received a great deal of attention and in a general way the motious of the wings are fairly well understood. We could probably very closely imitato Lhesd motions, bur. the question at once arises, in doing so, would wo be apptying our power in the most effec tive way? While somewhat similar, thp movement and construction of the wings of flying creatures vary considerably. What is best for a heavy body with short wings is by no means beat for a light body with long wing; nor does a sea bird, constantly on the wings, but perhaps not a rapid flyer, fly in the same way as a pigeon or a bumming bird, aud, in any particular caso, it does not necessarily follow that nature has provided tho moat efficient apparatus ; or, in other words, that the power the bird possesses could not be utilized more effectively. Na ture cannot always be trusUd. We can study and understand her law*, but she does not pretend to apply them on econom ical principles. Fish and marine auimals swim in a great variety of ways, they have all sorts of prop??lIing arrangements, but there can be no doubt that a screw propeller is vastly more efficient than any of them; and why should we try to copy tho motions of a bird's wing any more than those ofa Gsh'atail? The motions are very complicated in any case, aud our machines, imitating them, would be complex and liable to get out of order. And one cannot help thinking that we are about as likely to make a steam road wagon by imitating tho action of a horse as we are to make a practicable fly ing machine by copying the motions of a bird. The desired results can probably be obtained in a much more simple and effec tive way.?Popular Sciencc Monthly. ? o ? Cbdeeing His Own* Copfix. - Daniel G. Sper ry, a hotel keeper for tho past thirty years in tho village of South Windsor Hill, a few mile3 from Hartford, Conn , has predicted his own death within three weeks, and has made all prepara tions for the event. ITo has settled hi3 business affairs, and for several days past has been making visits anions old friends aud bidding them a linal farewell. Several days ago he ordtred his coffin from a Hartford undertaker, and directed that it bo built plainly and substantially and trimmed as ho directed. It was forwarded to him last Thurs day. He called at' a Hartford newspaper office and paid his subscription up to tho date?aboot ten days hence?when he predicts hia death will oc cur, and has given full directions to the sexton of the village cemetery for the digging of his grave. The old gentleman has had presentiments of death for a year or more past, but it is only recently that he acted upon them. On other topics hi3 mind is clear.

Dublin, Dec. 10.?The aggressive section of the Fenian Brotherhood was somewhat startled to-day by th? announcement that the man who recently surrendered to the police for protection and gave his name as John Kelly, and his occupation as a laborer, is really Joseph Smith, the Invincible, who turned iuformer and testified against the men hanged for the assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Lender-Sec retary Burke in Phoenix Park. Kelly, when he surrendered himself, stated that he was a member of a secret organization, and had been notified, under pain of death, to shoot Mr. Currau, County Court Judge, who ex amined the Invincibles under the crimes act; Mr. Bolton, Crown Solicitor, and others. He also said he was concered in the mali cioua burning of com belonging to the Ar tana Industrial School, and he mentioned the names of some farmers whose hay and corn were also to be burned. It will be remembered that on March 24 last a report was published throughout Great Britain stating that Joseph Smith, the informer had died from intemperance. On May 7 it was again announced that Joseph Smith had died in London, where he had for a long time been a hopeless drunkard. Hanged by a Mob. Kenton, Teuu.,Dec. 10.?About2 o'clock Tuesday morning two clerks in thn store of White and Boyle were awakened by a suf focating emoke. and discovered that the store was on fire. A thief had entered, stolen some goods, and then net lire to the house. By prompt efforts the flames were extinguished.
