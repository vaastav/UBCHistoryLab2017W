If Spain mill holds iluvunu and the con ports ami til tho considerable towns, the Insurgents still room ut will over at least two-lhlrils of the Inland country. If the determination of Spurn to put down the Insurrection seems but to strengthen wllh the lapse of time, and Is evi denced by ber unhesitating devotion of largely Increased military and iinval forces to the task, there Is much reason to believe that tho Insurgents have gained In point of numbers and character ami resources, iiiiu ure none me less Inlloxlble in their rcsulvn not to succumb, without, una. tically securing the grout objeols fur which lliey ivy i mo, ii npuiu nus noi yet re-estuo-llshed her authority, neither huve the Instir, gents yet made good their title to bo rcgurded as an Independent slate.

They view with wonder and admiration the cheerful resolution with which vast bodies of men aro sent across thousands of miles of ocean nildnn enormous debt accumulated, that the costly possession of the Gem of the An tilles muy still hold Its pluoo In the Spanish Crown, and yet neither the government nor the people of the United States hove shut their rnitaJ i . "ure ui events in umo or have fa led to run llxe the existence of conceded grievances, which Itavo led to the present re volt from the authority of Spain-grievances recognlxed by tho queen regent nnd bv the cortes, voiced by the most patriotic ond enlightened of Spanish statesmen without regard to party, nnd demonstrated by reforms proposed by the executive and approved bv the egislotlye branch of the Spanish government. It Is in the assumed temper nnd disposition of wio oiinnu government to remedy these griev ances, fortified bv Indleai inns nf Infliinntl,,! public opinion In Spain, that this government has hoped to discover the most promising nnd effective moansof composlng.the present strife, with honor and advantage to Spun, with the achievement of nil the rensonublo objects of the insurrection. It would seem that If Spain should olTer lo " Kocuino autonomy, a mensure of homo rulo which, while nresorvlnB the snveinluntv of Spain, would satisfy nil rntinnul require ments of her Spanish subjects, there should bo no jiisi reiiNou wny me pueiticntlon of the Is. luuo might not be effected on that basis. Knot, a result would appear to be In the interest of u i concerned, it would at once stop iho con- lllct, Which is HOW eonsNmlhtf the resourcou nf the Island and making It worthies for which ever puny mav ultimately prevail.

It hus been objected, on tho one side, that Spain should not promise autonomy until her insurgent aubiects luv down their arms. On the other sido. that promised autonomy, how ever liberal, is lnsunicle.nt, because without ossuruure or tno promise bolng lull, lied Hut tho reasonableness of a requirement by Spain uf unconditional surrender on tho part Ol me iiiBiirje:ii L illians oeiore mcirnutonoiny Is conceded is not nltogethcr auiiatout It ignores important feattirosof thesituntlon the stability two years' duration has given to tho Insurrection: the feasibility of its in- dellnito prolongation in the nature of things, and as shown by past experience; the utter and Imminent ruin of the island, unless the present strifo Is speedily composed; above all, the rauk utilises which all parties In Spain, all brunches of her government nnd nil her lend- lug public men concede to exist und profess a desire to retnovo. Facing such circumstances, to withhold Hie prefer of needed reforms until the parties demanding them put themselves at mercy by throwing down their arms, hus the appearance of neglecting the gravest of perils and invit ing suspicion us to tne sincerity oi uny pro fessed willingness to grunt reforms. The objection on behalf of tho Insurgents thut promised rcforniB can not be relied upon --must, of course, be considered, though we have no right to assume, and no reason ior as suming, that anything that Spain undertakes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done no- cording to both the spirit and the letter of the undertaking. Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions nnd precautions on the part of the weuker of two combatants aro always natural und not always unjustifiable, and being sincerely desirous In thn lntprnst of both as well as on Its own ac count that the Cuban problem should be solved with the leusl possinic oeiaj , m was iiiumuieu by this government to the government of Spain some mouths ugo that, If a satisfactory measure of home rule were tendered the Cu ban Insurgents and would be accepted by tbem upou a guaranty of Its execution, the United States would endeavor to tlnd a way not objectionuble to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. ... While no definite response to this Intimation has yet been received from the Spanish gov ernment, It Is believed to be not altogether welcome, while, as a treaty Is suggested, no reason Is perceived why it should not be ap proved by tue insurgents, tenner puny vu nil to nun the lmnortanre of early action, and both must reallio that to prolong the present stale of things for oven a short period will odd enormously to tho tlmo und labor and expendi ture necessary to bring about the industrial recuperation of the island. It Is, there fore, fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for hoollng the breach between Spain aud the insurgent Cu hai,H. tinnn the lilies above indicated, may be at once Inaugurated ond pushed to an Imme diate and successful Issue. The friendly of fices of the United States, olthcr lu the man ner above outlined, or In any other wny con sistent with our constitution and laws, will al ways be at the dlsposnl of either party. Whatever circumstances may arlso, our pol loy aud our Interests would constrain us to ob iect to the acquisition of the Island or the in terference with Its control by any other '"ttshnnld be added that It can not be reason- ablp assumed that the hitherto expectant at titude of the United States will be indefinitely maintained.

I therefore recommend that prompt measures be taken to remedy this condition, and that every encouragement be given to this deserving body of unpaid and voluntary eltl een soldiers, upon whose assistance we must largely rely In time of trouble.

The Pension Roll. The diminution of ourenormous pension roll and the decreuse of pension expenditure which have been suotleiieoulldcntlyioretold still fall in material realization. The number of pen sioners on the roll at the close of the fiscal year etided June 80, 18U6, was 970,078. This Is the largest number ever reported. Tho amount paid exclusively for pensions durlngthe yeur was Ii:i8,2l4,itll.91, a slight decrease from thut ot the preceding yeur, while the totul expendi tures on account of pensions, Including the cost ot maintaining the department and expenses attending pension distribution, amounted to 142,2u6.'.f0.59, or within a very small fraction of one-third of tbe entire ex pense of supporting the government during the same yeur.

In consequence of these proceedings und increasing complica tions, added to the default occurring oa the first day of Jauuury, 18, a condition will be presented ut thut dute, so far as this company Is concerned, that must cmphuslro the man date of the act of 1887 and give to executive duty under Its provisions a more Important aspeot. IS 'Ihercfore, unless congress shall otherwise direct or shall huvo previously determined upon a different solution of tho problem there will haruly appear to exist any reason for de laying, beyond the date of the default above mentioned, such executive action as will prom ise to subserve the public Interests and save tne government irom tno loss threatened py iurtuer inaction, 

DEPARTMENT OE AGRICULTURE. Worthy of Constant Care and Euconrage. ment. The department of agriculture is so Intl mately related to tho welfare of our people and the prosperity of our nation that it should constantly receive the core and encouragement of the government. From a small beginning it hus grown to be tbe center of agricultural intelligence aud the source of aid and encouragement to agricul tural enorts. i.irge sums or money are an nually appropriated for the maintenance of this department, and It must be confessed that tne legislation relating to it has always been directed lu the interest of nructlcal fiinntna- nr properly tuurdad iuml nt UrnKtA nnrt 11 v t ra via Banco, So fur. hnwevnr. nn mi hi in mnnAV haa been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help avuumij tin tue son, no expenuiture ... v.. .ii o urouiuoiy maue or more gener ally approved V ihe people.

The Interstate commerce commission haa, durlngthe last year, supplied obundant evi dence of lu usefulness and the importance of the work committed to Ita charge. Public transportation la a universal necessity, and the question of just and reasonable charges tneretor has become ot vital Importance, not ouly to shippers and carriers, but also lo the vast multitude ot produoera and consumers. Tbe Justice and equity ct tbe principles em bodied In the existing law passed for the pur pose ot regulating these charges are every where conceded, and there appeara to be no question that the policy, thus entered upon, has a permanent place la our legislation. As the present statute, when enacted, was. In the nature of the ease, more or less tentative and experimental, It was hardly expected to apply a complete and adequate system. While its wholesome erects are manifest, and having amply Justified lu enactment. It is evident that all desired reforms in transportation methods have not been fully accomplished. In view of the Judicial interpretation which some provisions of this statute have received and the defects disclosed by the efforts made for lu enforcement, Its revision and amend ment appear to be essential, to the end that It may more effectually reach the evils designed to be corrected. I hope the recommendations of the commission upon this subject will be promptly and favorably considered by the oou gress. , , THE 

TARIFF QUESTION, suggestions Touching the Present Law and Ita Operations. I desire to recur to the statements elsewhere made concerning the government'a reoeipts and expenditures for the purpose of venturing upon some suggestions touching our present tariff law and Its operation. Wils statute took effect on the Mtn day of August, ItW, Whatever muy be Its shorteom lngs as a complete measure of tariff reform. It must be conceded that it has opened the way to a freer and greater exchange of commodi ties between the United Slates and other countries, and thus furnished a wider market for our products and manufacturers. The only entire fiscal year during whlob this law has been enforced ended on the 80th day of June, 1890. In that year our imports Increased over those ot the previous year more than tfl.ftoo.lloO, while the value of domestic products wo ex ported, und which found markets abroad, was nearly t"0,000,000 moro than durlug the pre ceding year. Those who Insist that the cost to our people of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful use should only be Increased through tariff charges to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of the government, as well as those who claim that tariff charges may be laid upon such articles beyond the necessities of government revenue, and with the additional purposouf bo Increasing their price in our markets as to give American manufac turers and producers better and more profita ble opportunities, must agree that our tariff laws are only primarily Justified as sources of revenue to enable the government to meet the necessary expenses of Us maintenance. Con. Sldered as to its sufficiency In this uspect. the present law cun by no means full under Just condemnation During the only complete llscul year ot Its operation It has yielded near ly fO.UOO.OoO more revenue than was received from tariff duties In the preceding year. There was, nevertheless, a deficit between our re ceipts ond expenditures of a little more than $26,000,000. This, however, was not unexpected. The situation was such In December last, seven months before the close of the fiscal year, that the secretary of the treasury foretold a defi ciency of $17,000,000. The great and increasing apprehension and timidity in business circles, and the depression lu all activities Intervening since that time, re sulting from cnuses perfeotlv well understood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or Its operation, seriously checked the Imports we Would huvo otherwise received, and readily acoouut for tho difference between this estimate of the secretary and the actual deficiency, lis well as for a continued deficit. Indeed, It must be confessed that wo ootild hardly have had a more unfavorable pe riod than the lust two years for the collection of tariff revenue. We can nut reasonably hope that our recuperation trom this business de pression will be sudden, t ut it has already set in with a promise of acceleration nnd continu ance. I believe our present tariff law, if al lowed a ralr opportunity, will, In tho noar fu ture, yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical expenditures, will overcome all de ficiencies, Need Not Excite or Disturb Us. In the meantime no deficit that has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet any such deficit In the treusury, In addi tion to a gold reserve of 11 0,000.000, a surplus of more than f 128.000,000 applicable to the pay ment of tbe expenses of tho government, and which must, unless expended for that purpose, remain a nscleis hoard; or. If not extravagant ly wasted, must in any ovent be perverted from the urpo,,o of its exaction ioi eur people. uc paw...: iiiorcKtin, oi any uenoienoy m tin! rvenua m,m this fund is nothing mora than its ,:iptr and legitimate use. . A Marter of Supreme Tinportanct, I suppose it will not be denied mat U"inf the present law our ueoo:c ooihIu the ncces. i aurles of a comfortable existence ut- cheaper rate than formerly. This Is a matter of supreme Importance, since It Is the i alpable duty or every Just government to make the burdens of taxation as light as possible. The people should not bo required to relinquish this privilege of cheaper living except under the stress of tholr government's necessity made plainly manifest. OUR 

FINANCIAL SYSTEM. Weakness antl Vlcea of Our Present Mel hod. This reference to the conditions and pros pects of our revenues naturally suggests un allusion to tho woakness and vices of ourfinnn cial method. They have been frequently pressed upon the attention ot congress in previous communications and the inevitable danger of their continued toleration pointed out. Without now repenting these details, I can not refrain from again earnestly present nig tne necessity ot tne prompt rerorm of a system opposed to every rule of sound Unanca and shown by eiperlenco to be fraught with tue gravest pern auo perplexity. Withdrawals of Uold Obligations. Because we may be enjoying a temporary re lief from Us depressing Influence, tills- should not lull us into a fulse security, nor lead us to lorget tne suuaennesB oi past visitations, i am more convinced than ever that we can have no assured financial ponce and safety until tha government currency obligations upon which gold may be demanded from the treasury era withdrawn from circulation and cancelled. This might be done, as has been heretofore recommended, by their exchange for long term bonds bearing a low rate of Interest or by their redemption with the proceeds of such bonds. This plan Of Issuing bonds for the purpose of redemption certainly appears to be the most effective and direct path to the needed reform. In default of this, however, it would be a step in luc rignt uirection u currency oougauonsi redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed, should be cancelled insteud of reissued. This operation would be a slow remedy, but It would improve present conditions. National Bank Notes. National banks should redeem their own poles. Tbey should bo allowed to Issue circu lation to the par valuo ot bonds deposited as security for redemption, and the tax on their circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of one percent. In considering projects for the retirement ot the United States notes and treusury notes Is sued under the new law of 1890, 1 am of tne opinion we have placed too much stress, upon the danger of contracting the currency and havo calculated too little upon the gold that would be added to our olrculntlon If invited to us by betterand ssfer financial methods. It is not bo much contraction or our currency that should be avoided oa IU unequal distribution. The entire case may be presented by the statement that the day of sensible and sound flnanolal methods wilt not dawn upon us until our government abandons the banking busi ness and the accumulation of funds, and con- nnes iu monetary operations to the receipt of the money contributed by the people for IU support, and the expenditure of such money for the people's benellltOur business InUresU and all good citizens long for rest from fever ish agitation, and the Inauguration by the government of a reformed flnanolal policy which will esoourage enterprise and make certain the rewards ot labor and Industry. 

MONOPOLY. Trusts and Other Aggregations ot Capital, Another topic in which our people rightfully take a deep interest may be here briefly con sidered. I refer to tbe existence of trusts and other huge aggregations of capiul, the object of whloh la to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade, Industry or oom merce, and to stifle wholesome competition. When those are defended It la nsualfy on the ground that, though they Increase prices, they also reduce prloes, and thus may benefit tbe public.

There are many people in Mississippi who do not know tbat tbelr State la making; any advancement tt nil upon th lines of progress and prosperity, but think tbat she Is standing entirely sttll, and perhaps, such individuals are not bettering their fortunes to an appre ciable extent. While tbey are stand ing still in a material way, possibly from lack of energy or something else, their Statu Is forging ber way to the front ahead of most of her sister States of tbe Union, and unless something oo curs to retard ber onward march she rill soon become one of tbe leading States in the grand Southern galaxy, in which she has not heretofore at least since the war b?en a very bright mem ber in tbo matter of enterprise and progress. In a summing up ot tbe recent report of tbe postmaster 'general it is found tbat the whole southern section of the Union is advancing in a much greater ratio than is either the North, East or West. It is to be observed that there baa beorric-JtfBaf bet Increase in number of postofllcos established in UjO, tbe additional offices created being 890, but of these more than 23 por cent, were in the five Southern States, Missis sippi, Arkansas, Texas, Georgia and Kentucky. It Is significant tbat in tbe States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Penn sylvania and New York all taken to gether only a little more than a third as many new postolllces wero estab lished enough to satisfy all but those wbo want to be postmasters. It is sur prising to And that more new offices wero established in the one State ot Mississippi than in tbo four Northwest ern States of Montana, Washington and the two Dakotas. Thoso facts point unmistakably to tbe direction in which capital and population are traveling. With this trend in our direction, our people should encourage tbe coming of both money and immigrants, and do nothing whatever to obstruct or divert the tide. Natchez Democrat.
