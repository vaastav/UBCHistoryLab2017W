After Vespers, at 3 o'clock, the congregation in procession made the four prescribed visits, two to St. Stephen's bourch and two to St. Henry's. Upon their return to It. Henry's church the last time, the Rev. Pastor, Father Bagaertal delivered the formal opening address. The exercises were eoncloded with Benediotion of the most Bless ad Sacrament. Wednesday and Friday even ings sermons were preached in German to large congregations. The exercises for to-day and next SundRy will be the same en on last Sunday. There will also be sermons on Wednesday and Friday evenings of the next two weeks. The fair for St. John's Church closed Wed. needay night.

Education and charity r, hob must be taxed. And here we most not t her limit our reflections to the President's c the message. One of our city papers-the o met Times-has come out openly in approval of f slul the President's policy. . t It says (issue of Thursday, 9h inet) : The The abuses that have crept into thecustom of 1 bers exempting church property from taxation are F lay) already attracting the attentive consideration e of statesmen and political economists, and Presi- I the dent Grant, on taking the sharply-defined at rner titude he has, only expresses the popular eun Dis- timent.

As to the President's alleged point -The ing out of the abuse, it is all in the imagi irlsh nation of the Times. There is no such at 3 pointing out. It is a sweeping demand nade that the exemption be withdrawn, not that ben's the abuses of that exemption be abated.

It is not the abuses that are to udy be suppressed, but the institutions them here selves, so far as taxation can do it. riday The Timnes goes on to describe the long rows of buildings rented for traffic which Wed. adorn the streets of this very city, and are eced- exempt from taxation as charity property. We If so, it is an abuse of the law. Our statute aeto provides for the exemption of property de t voted to an educational, a charitable or a Sreligious purpose "so long as actually used large for that perpose only." (R. S., p. 629). Ift pony, perchance, public officials have unduly re was laxed this law is its application, that is n. not the fault of the law. poned As to the facts cited by the Times, how 5. for ever, we must require a little more in so on formation before giving them implicit Poy- credence. "Long rows of buildings de voted to traflc," says the Times, Now, we esend demand, so far as we can be supposed to Bea by have a right in any capacity whatever to demand, of that paper a specification of S these rows. They may belong, if they boo exist, to some Protestant Institation, bat there are known so be a great n1fl1me01 WOf n Catholic institutions in this eity, and they great are as liable as the others to bear the color onus of the rather indefinite charge they of the Times.

The fol- on t lowing, in illustration of both points, is Ti bt taken from the Register's resume of the rh at Gazette's article : ee be The Gazette thinks that, outside of the re- fe th ligious, there is a political aspect of the con versions to Catholicism. To the question: :1- Will the negro vote the Republican ticket as to before tit answers that it is doubtful; for al- b though the Catholic Church has practically maintained an equality of the races in wor- is tea ship, communion and burial, its tendency is gO decidedly Southern Democratic or even Con ity federate.

From this fact the Gasette deduces, con- P of nidering the domination of the clergy over the family and all the relations of private life, that the negro, who has heretofore blindly tl voted the Radical ticket, will just as blindly a vote the Democratic ticket presented to him aof by the priest in the confessional, under the a are penalty of losing the absolution of his sins and ti ion eternal life if he dares to vote the Repub esi- lican ticket. at- We are obliged to the Gamette for the tl or complimentary notice. We should cer- s atainly have been a Confederate paper if in 8 S existence some dozen of years ago, but as e we were born into the journalistic family t r- about three years after the Contederacy this had ceased to be, we think there must be a and mistake somewhere. It is quite true that. our venerable Archbishop was an intense is Confederate, as also Rev. Father Ryan, es- afterwards for a long time editor of this aot- paper, but that was while there was a Con agi- federacy. Perhaps our neighbor has con inch founded us with the Propagateur. and Or it may be that by " Confederate " the that "a:ette means "Southern." If so: Yah, He yah. The MORNING STAR is Southern, cal- without ceasing to be National. It holds that that the South was perfectly right in the Ices. principles on which it fought the war. It the believes that the South had the right to in- secede, and was wrongfully coerced back er- into the Union. But it does not, by any e to means, hold now that the South ought to be em- discontented until it gets out of the Union again. On the contrary, the long issue which took it out-slavery-is finoally hich dead, and the outrageous tyranny which I are has made union so oppressive since the war erty. is rapidly disappearing. We, therefore, stute hold that it is better now to stay in the Sde- Union. And as long as we are in it, we or a think that the South ought to rule the used country, as she always used to do, and as Ift she naturally must continue to do by virtue y re- of her superior intelligence, morality and at is courage. We don't blame the Northern people for their inferiority in saying this, how- becauseit results partly from the rigor of e in- their climate and partly from the fact that plicit Southern society has never been so s de- thoroughly as theirs permeated with the w, we fanatical hypocrisy of the pilgrim fathers. ed to Regarding the attack upon the Church as er to a political engine, it is perfectly groundless. on of The Gaette fears that the Church in gaio they ing over negroes to Catholicity will ak·e , but them Democrats.

Congress and the t n- President have nothing to do with M be schools. No such power is conferred by t y the Constitution on the general govern- E yv ment, and any effort to provide for it by an e amendment is another move towards cen- To od tralization. We think it a matter of con b- gratulation that two journals of such in- B be fluence should so promptly take so just a s r- stand on a question of such vital import in ance. as We can only regret that we are not able th ily to place the Times in the same category. in That paper merely says at first of these ne ay absurdities in the message that they present th issues which may eventually attain to an be at overshadowing importance.

It will not do to make things too easy for men or totl families. A government may furnish its boa people not only with spectacles and plays, a as did the Roman Emperors, but with taxe I clothing and food and schools. This is bn well known principle and is called Com- that munism. It was practically tested on a large orti scale in Sparta. vasi t But what is the effect of all this I The tax tree never gets strength to stand the storm co alone. The citizen is found without indi- equ viduality. He is one of a herd. He has emp not been formed in the great school of life's *dig struggle, where every man must provide i for himself and his family. His pride is e wanting, his self-reliasce has been dwarfed; whi t his sense of responsibility remains undevel- to C oped. whi a All the elements of independence are mrn f wanting to such a man.

DUCATION. We are a republic whereof one man Is as good as another before the law. Under such a ance form of government it is of the greatest im rou'd portance that all should be possessed of edn ocation and intelligence enough to cast a vote ly f with a right understanding of its meaning. A s he large association of ignorant men cannot for mong ny considerable period oppose a successful resistance to tyranny and oppression from the mans educated few, but will inevitably sink .into cated acquiescence to the will of intelligence whether directed by the demagogue or priest the craft. Hence the education of the masses be arlier comes of the first necessity for the preservation of our institutions. They are worth preserv idal ing because they have secured the greatest good s and to the greatest portion of the population oc steli- any form of government yet devised. All other forms of government approaeb it just sarac- in proportion to the general diffusion of edo a that. cation and independence of thought and action.
