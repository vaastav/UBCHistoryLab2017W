"WyT'V V :, THE PERRYSBURG JOURNAL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1907. h h R" . IE PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGL (bAU8ES OF THE PRESENT FINAN . CIAL CONDITIONS IS MADE THE CHIEF TOPIC. SUGGESTS REMEDIES FOR ILLS JEONTROL OF CORPORATIONS AND RAILROAD8 TO PREVENT OVERCAPITALIZATION. flBelleves This Would Salve the Prob lem Togethor with Provlilon for More Elastic Currency Recom mends Postal Banks and Asks for Legislation Along Many Lines. Washington, Dec. 3. Prcsldont Roosevelt's annual message to congress 3a a voluminous document of nearly -3Q,000 words, by far tho lonsast mes sago ho has over submitted to congress. Tho opening subject of tho massage Is the financial condition of tho country, and for which tho president lays much of tho blamo upon"unscrupulous stock -peculators, and says: "In any large body of men, however, thoro aro certain to bo some who are dlBhoncst, and If tho conditions are wuch that these mon prosper or com mit their misdeeds with Impunity, their example Is a very evil thing for tho community. Where these men aro busi ness men of great sagacity and of tem perament both unscrupulous anil rock less, and whero tho conditions aro such that they net without suporvlslon or controf nnd at llrst without effective check from public opinion, they delude itnany Innocont people Into making In vestments or embarking in kinds of ifcuslncss that aro really unsound. When the mls,dccd3 of these successful ly dishonest men are discovered, sut orlng comes not only upon them, but upon tho Innocent men whom they lhavo misled. Tt Is a painful awakening, whenever It occurs: and, naturally, when it does occur t.ioso who suffer nro apt to forget that the longer It was deferred tho more painful It would be. T '-In tho effort to punish the guilty It is 'both wlso and proper to ondqavor so rfar as possible to minimize tho dis tress of tlose who have boon misled by tho guilty. Yet It Is not posslblo to .refrain becauso of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are tho ultimate causes of tho suf- Bering, and. as a means to this end, where possible to punish those re sponsible for them. There may bo hon est differences of opinion as to many Governmental policies; bat surely thoro can bo no such differences as to the need of unflinching persovorance in tho Twar against successful dishonesty." He quotes at length from his mos sagc of last year In which ho advo cated federal control of corporations doing lntorstate business, and believes -that In such control would bo found the iremedy for overcapitalization and stock speculation which ho believes liavo brought about tho present llnnn clal conditions. He says: "Our steady aim should bo by legis lation, cautiously and carefully under takon, but resolutely persevered In, to cassert tho sovereignty of tho national icovernment by afllrmatlvo action. "This is only In form an Innovation, rin substanco It Is morely a' restoration; tor from tho earliest tlmo such regula tion of Industrial activities has been recognized In the action of tho law irnaklng bodies; and all that I propose Us to meet tho changed conditions in ; fBUCh manner ns will prevent tho com monwealth abdicating the power it has :always possessed, not only In this coun try, but also In England before and islnco this country becamo a separate . .matlon. ) CFedernI Control of i ' tltnllroada In Favored. "No small part of tho trouble that wo Jiavo comes from carrying to an ex treme tho national vlrtuo of self-re liance, of Independence In lnltiatlvo and action. It is wlso to conserve this jvlrtuo" and to provide for Its fullest ex ercise, compatible with seeing that lib erty does not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunatoly, this Is tho kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation inevitably breeds. Tho founders of the constitution pro vided that tho national government should havo complete and sole control of Interstate commerce. Thero was then practically no Interstate business tcavo such as was conducted by water, and this tho national government at -once. proceeded to regulate In thorough going and erfecttvo fashion. Condi tions havo now so wholly changed that t tho Interstate commerco by water Is In- significant compared with tho amount V that goes by land, and almost all big (business concerns are now engaged in Interstate commerce As a result, It can be but partially and Imperfectly controlled or regulated by the action of any one of tho several 'states; such ac tion tnovltably tending to be either too drastic or olse too lax, and In either aso ineffective for purposes of JubUcc. s. Only tho national government can In thoroughgoing fashion exercise the ineeded control. This deeu not mean that there should be any extension of tfcderal authority, for such authority already exists under the constitution in amplest and most far-reaching form; 'but it does mean that thoro should bo tan extension of federal activity. This )ls not advocating centralization. It Is aneroly looking facts In the face, and trcallzlng that centralization In business j 3ias already come and can not be avold ' .d or undone, and that the public at ' Hargo can only protect Itself from cer taln ovll effects of this business cen tralization by providing better methods rior the exercise of control through the (authority already centralized In the -.national government by the constitu tion itself. There must be ne halt in the healthy constructive eeurse of ac tion which this natlen has elected to jpursuo, and has steadily pursued, dur ing the last six years, as shown both In 'the legislation of the congress and the (administration ef the law by the de partment of Justice. The meet vital meed is in connection with the railroads. As ' to these, in my Judgment there rahould now be either a national incor poration uct or a law lleeaslng railway companies to engage in interstate com imerce upon certain cenltlen. The law tieihould be so framed aa te give to the dnterotato commerce commission power -to pass upon the future issue of securi ties, while ample means should be pro--vided to enable the commission, when ever in its Judgment it is necessary, to jmake a physical valuation of any rall coad. As I stated in my message to the -congress a year ago, railroads should !bo given power to enter into agree jnents, subject to these agreements be ing made public In minute detail and to tho consent of the Interstate commerco commission. being first obtained. Until tho national government assumes proper control of interstate commerce In the exercise of tho authority it al ready posscssos, It will bo Imposslblo either to glvo to or to get from tho railroads full Justice Tho railroads nnd all othor great corporations will do well to recognize that this control must como; tho only question (s as to what governmental body can most wisely oxorclso It. Tho courts will do termlno tho limits within which tho federal authority can exerclso it, and thoro will still romaln ample work within each stato for tho railway com mission of that state; and tho national Interstato commerco commission will work In harmony with the several stato commissions, each within Its own prov ince, to achlovo tho desired end. Control af lntorstate Ilualneaa Cencornn Urged. "Moreover, In my Judgment there should bo additional legislation looking to tho proper control of tho great business con cerns encased In Interstato business, this control to be oxerclsed for their own bcncllt and prosperity no less than for the protection of Investors and of tho general public. As I havo repeatedly said in messages to congress and else where, cxpcrlenco has definitely shown not merely tho unwisdom but tho futility of endeavoring to put a stop to all busi ness combinations. Modern Industrial conditions nro such that combination is not only necessary but Inevitable. It Is so in tho world of business Just as It Is so In tho world of labor, upd It Is as Idlo to desire to put an end to all corpora tions, to all big combinations of capital, as to desire to put an end to combina tions of labor. Corporation nnd labor union nllko hnvo como to stay. Each if properly managed is a source of good and not evil. Whenover In either thoro Is ovll, It should bo promptly held to ac count; but it should receive "hearty en couragement so long as It 13 proporly managed. It is profoundly Immoral to put or keep on tho statute books a law, nominally In tho Interest of public moral ity, that really puts a premium upon public Immorality, by undertaking to forbid honest men from doing what must bo dono under modern business condi tions, so that the law Itself provides that Its own Infraction must be tho condition precedont upon business success. To aim at tho accomplishment of too much usu ally means tho accomplishment of too lit tle, and often the doing of positive dam age. "Tho antitrust law should not bo re pealed; but It should be mado both more ellletcnt and moro In harmony with act ual conditions. It should bo so amended ns to forbid only tho kind qf combination which docs harm to tho general public, bucIi amendment to be accompanied by, or to bo an Incident of, n grant of su pervisory power to tho government over these big corporations engaged In Inter state business. This should bo accom panied by provision for tho compulsory publication of accounts and tho subjec tion of books and papers to, the Inspec tion of tho government ofllclals. A be ginning has already been made for such supervision by tho establishment of tho bureau of corporations. "Tho antitrust law should not, prohibit combinations that do no Injustice to the public, still loss those the existence of which is on tho whole of benefit to tho public. But even If this feature of tho law were abolished, thero would remain as nn equully objectionable feature the difficulty and dolay now incldont to its enforcement. The government must now submit to irksome and repeated delays before obtaining a final decision of the courts upon proceedings Instituted, and oven, a favorable decreo may mean nn empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to control theso corporations by lawsuits means to Impose upon both tho depart , ment of Justico and the courts an Im possible burden; It Is not feasible to carry on morcthan a limited number of such suits. Such a law to bo really effective must of course bo administered by an executive body, and not merely by means of lawsuits. The design should bo to prevent the abuses incident to tho crea tion of unhealthy and Improper combina tions, instead of waiting until they are in existence nnd then attempting to de stroy them by civil or criminal proceed ings. Inventing Public Should lie Amply Safeguarded. "The congress has the power to charter corporations to engage in interstate and foreign commerce, and a general law can bo enacted under tho provisions of which existing corporations could tnko out fed eral charters and now federal corpora tions could bo created. An essential pro vision of such a law should bo a mothod of predetermining by somo federal board or commission whether the applicant for a federal charter was an association or combination within tho restrictions of tho federal law. Provision should also be made for complete publicity In nil matters affecting tho public and complete protec tion to tho lnvostlng public and the share holders In tho matter of Issuing corporate securities. If an incorporation law is not deemed advisable, a license act for big Interstato corporations might bo enacted; or a combination of the two might bo tried. Tho supervision established might bo analogous to that now exorcised over national banks. At least, the antitrust act should bo supplemented by specific prohibitions of the methods which ex perience has shown havo been of most scrvlco In enabling monopolistic combina tions to crush out competition. 'Tho real owners of a corporation should bo com pelled to do business in their own name. The right to hold stock In other corpora tions should hoareafter bo denied to Inter state corporations, unless en approval by the proper 'government officials, and a prerequisite to such approval should be tho listing with the government of all owners and stockholders, both by tho corporation owning such stock and by the corporations in which such stock Is owned. "To confer upon the national govern ment, in connection with the amendmont I advocate In the antitrust law, power of supervision ever big business concerns engaged in interstate commerco, would benefit them as it has benefited tho na tional banks. In the recent business crisis It Is noteworthy that the Institu tions which' failed were Institutions which were not under the supervision and control of the national government. Those which were under national con trol stood tho test. "National control of the kind above nd vecated would bo te the benefit of every well-managed railway. From tho stand point of tho public there Is need for ad ditional tracks, aditlonal terminals, and Improvements In the actual handling of the railroads, and all this as rapidly as pesslble. Ample, safe, and speedy trans portation facilities are even more neces sary than cheap transportation. There fere, there is need for the Investment of meney which will provide for all theso things while at the same tlmo securing as fas as Is possible better wages and shorter hours for their employes. There fore, while there must bo Just and rea sonable regulation of rates, we should be the first to protest against any arbitrary and unthinking movement to cut them down without tho fullest and most care ful consideration of all Interests con cerned and of tho actual needs of the situation. Only a special body of men acting for the national government un der authority conferred upon it by tho congress Is competent to pass Judgment on such a matter. Greater ISInatlcIty In Currency In Urged. The president quotes extensively from his last message in dealing with the di rect subject of currency legislation, and. says: "I ignln urge on the congress the need of Immediate attention to this matter. Wo nod a greater elasticity In our cur rency; prpvldcd, of course, that wo recog nize tho evon greater need ef a safo and socurn curroncy. Thero must always bo tho most rigid examination by the na tional authorities. Provision should bo mado for an omorgency currency. The cmorgoncy Issua should, of course, bo made with an offactlvo guaranty, and up on conditions carofully prescribed by tho government. Such emergency lssuo must bo based on adoquato securities approved by tho government, and must bo issued under a heavy tnx. This would permit currency being Issued when the demand for It was" urgont, while securing Its re tirement ns tho demand fell off. It Is worth Investigating to determine whether olllcors and directors of natlenal banks should ever be allowed to loan to them selves. Trust companies should bo sub ject to the same supervision as banks; legislation to this effect should be en acted for tho District of Columbia and tho territories. "Tct wo must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the subject can enly accomplish a certain amount. Ne legislation oan by any possibility guar antee tho business community against the results of speculative folly any moro than it can guaranteo an Individual against the results of his extravagance. When an In dividual mortgages his house to buy an automobile ho Invites disaster; and when wealthy men, or men who pose as such, or aro unscrupulously er foolishly cagor to become such, Indulge In reckless spec ulationespecially If It Is accompanied by dishonesty they Jeopardize not only their own future but tho future of all their In nocent fellow-citizens, for they expose tho wholo business community to panic nnd distress." Ho ndviscs against any general tariff legislation this session of congress, and says: "In a country of such phenomenal growth as ours it 13 probably well that every dozen yenr3 or so tho tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized so as to seo that no excessive or Improper bene fits are conferred thoreby, that proper revenue is provided, and that our foreign trade Is encouraged. There must always be as a. minimum a tnrlft which will not only al low for tho collection of an ample rcv enuo but which will at least make good tho difference In cost of production here nnd abroad; that Is, the difference in the labor cost hero and abroad, for tho woll-bclng of tho wage-worker must ever bo n cardinal point of American policy. Tho question should bo approached pure ly from a business standpoint; both the tlmo nnd the manner of tho change being such as to arouso tho minimum of agi tation and .disturbance in tho business world, and to glvo tho least play for selfish and factional motives. The solo consideration should be to sec that tho sum total of changes represent tho pub lic good. This means that tho subject cannot with wisdom be dealt with In the year preceding a presidential election, be cause as a matter of fact experience has conclusively shown that at such a time It Is imposslblo to get men to treat It from tho standpoint of the public good. In my Judgment the wise tlmo to deal with tho matter Is Immediately after such elec tion." He nsks for tho repeal of the tariff on paper and wood pulp. He reviews and enlarges upon his pre vious recommendations for the enact ment of federal inheritance and Income tax laws. Attention Is called to the prosecution of wealthy offenders against the national laws, and in this connection he asks that tho laws under which these prosecutions are brought bo strengthened and made moro definite The Use nnd tlir AbliKc of Injunctions. "Instances of abuse In the granting of Injunctions In labor disputes continue to occur, and tho resentment in tho minds of those who feel that their rights nre being Invaded and their liberty of action and of speech unwarrantably restrained continues to grow. Much of tho attack on tho uso of tho process of Injunction is wholly without warrant; but I am con strained to expross the belief that for some of It thero Is warrant. This ques tion Is becoming moro and moro of prime Importance, and unless tho courts will themselves deal with it in effective man ner, it Is certain ultimately to demand some form of legislative action. It would be most uufortunato for our social wel fare If wo should permit many honest and law-abiding citizens to feel that they had Just causo for regarding our courts with hostility. I earnestly com mend to tho attention of the congress this matter, so that somo way may bo dovlsed which will limit the abuse of In junctions and prefect thoso rights which from tlmo to tlmo It unwarrantably in vades. Moreover, discontent Is often ex pressed with the use of the process of Injunction by the courts, not only in la bor disputes, but where state laws aro concorned. I refrain from discussion of this question as I am informed that it will soon reoelvo tho consideration of tho supreme court." Of other legislation In the Interest of labor ho favors federal Inspection of rail roads; providing limited but definite com pensation for accidents to all workmen employed In any way by the government, and says: "The constitutionality of the employers" liability act passed by the preceding con gress has been carried before the courts. In two Jurisdictions the law lias been de clared unconstitutional, and in three Juris dictions its constitutionality has been af firmed. Tho question has been carried to tne supreme court, the case has been heard by that tribunal, and a decision Is expected at an early date. In the event that the court should affirm the consti tutionality ef the act, I urge further leg islation along the lines advocated In my message to the preceding congress. Tho practice ef putting the entire burden of loss of life or limb upon the victim er tne victim's family Is a form of bocIkI In justice in which the United States stands In unenviable prominonce. In both eur federal and our state legislation we have, with fow exceptions, scarcoly gone farther than the repeal of tho fellew sorvant principle ef tho old law of liabil ity, and In some of our states even this slight modification of & complete out grown principle has not yet been se cured." He favors the extension of the eight hour law to all departments of the gov ernment, ond to all work carried on by the government. He urges legislation for the compulsory Investigation of in dustrial disputes, and says: "The need for some provision for such investigation was forcibly Illustrated during the past summer, A strike of telegraph operators seriously Interfered with telegraphic communication, caus ing great damage to business Interests and serious Inconvenlenco to the gen eral public. Appeals were made to me from many parts of tho country, from city councils, from boards of trade, from chambers of commerce, and from labor organizations, urging that stops bo taken to terminate tho strike. Everything that could with any pro priety bo done by a representative of the government was done without avail, and for weeks the public stood by and suffered without recourse of any kind. Had tho machinery existed and had there been authority for compulsory investigation of tho dispute, the public would have been placed in possession of the merits of the controversy, and public opinion would, probably have brought about prompt adjustment, , "It Is idle to hold that without good laws evils such ns child labor, as tho ovor-worklng of women, as tho fnll uro to protect employes from loss of llfo or limb, can bo offoctlvoly reached, any moro than tho ovlls of robatos and stock-watering can bo reached without good laws. To fall to stop theso prao tiers by legislation means to force, honest mon into them, becauso other wlso tho dlBhoncst who suroly will tako advantngo of thorn will have ovorythlng'thelr own way. If tho states will correct theso ovlls, woll and good; but tho nation must stand ready to aid thorn. Inland Wntcrvrny Systems Bliould lie Dcovlopcd. "Tho conservation of our national re sources and their proper uso constitute tho fundamental problem which under lies almost overy othor problem of our national life. Wo must maintain for eur civilization tho adequate material basis without which that civilization cannot exist. Wo must show foresight, we must look nhoad. As a nation we not only enjoy a wonderful measure of present prosperity but If this prosper ity is used aright it is an oarnest of future success such as no othor nation will hnvo. Tho roward of foroslght foi this nntlon is groat and easily forotold. But thero must be the look ahead, there must bo a realization of the fact that to waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and oxhaust the land Instead of using tt so as to Increaso Its usefulness, will result in undormlnlng In the days of our children the vory prosperity which wo ought by right to' hand down to them amplified and devel oped. For tho last few years, through sovoral ngenctes, tho government has been endeavoring to got our people te look ahead nnd to substitute a planned and orderly dovolopment of our re sources In place of n haphazard striv ing for Immcdlnto profit. Our great river systems should bo dovolopo as national water highways; tho Missis sippi, with Its tributaries, standing first In Importance, and tho Columbia sec ond, although thero are many others of Importance on tho Pacific and Atlantic and the gulf Blopcs. Tho national gov ernment should undertake this work. and I hope a boglnning will be made In tho present congress; and the great est of all our rivers, tho Mississippi, should receive especial nttontion. From the Great Lakes' to tho mouth of the Mississippi there should bo a deep wa terway, with deep waterways leading from it to tho east and tho west. Such a waterway would practically mean the extonslon of our coast lino Into the very hoart of our country. It would be of Incalculable benefit to our people. If begun at onco it can bo carried through In tlmo appreciably to relievo tho con gestion of our great freight-carrying lines of railroads. Tho work should be systematically and continuously carried forward in accordance with somo well conceived plan. Tho main streams should be Improved to tho highest point of' efficiency before tho Improve ment of tho branches Is attempted; and the work should bo kept free from overy taint of recklessness or Jobbery." Attention Is called to tho work of Ir rigation and reclamation of govern ment lands. In tho samo connection he asks for a revision of the public land laws along the lines proposed by tho public lands commission. Believes the government should increaso its efforts to consorvo our forests and should In crease by purchase tho existing forest preserves. On tho subject of the natural resources of tho nation ho says: "In tho eastern United States the mineral fuels havo already passed Into the hands of largo private owners, and thoso of tho west are rapidly following. It Is obvious that theso fuols should be conserved and not wasted, and It would bo well to protect tho people against unjust and cxtortlonato prices, so far as that can still bo done. What has been accomplished in the great oil fields of tho Indian Territory by the action of tho administration offers a striking example of tho good results of Buch a policy. In my Judgment the government should havo tho right to keep tho fee of the coal, oil and gas fields in Its own possession and to lease the rights to develop' them under proper regulations; or else, if tho con gross will not adopt this method, the coal doposlts should bo sold under lim itations, to conserve thorn as public utilities, tho right to mine coal being separated from tho title to the sell. The regulations should permit coal lands to be worked in suftlctont quan tity by tho several corporations. The present limitations havo been absurd, excessive, and sorvo no useful purpose, and often render It necessary that thero should bo either fraud or olse abandonment of tho work of getting out the coal." Presrrea of the Worli On the Pannmn Cnnnl. "Work on tho Panama canal Is pro ceeding in a highly satisfactory man ner. In March tho total excavation In the Culebra Cut, whero offort was chiefly concentrated, was 815,270 cubic yards. In April this was Increased to 879,527 cubic yards. Thore wns n con siderable decreaso in the output for May and June owing partly to tho ad vent of tho rainy season and partly to temporary troublo with tho steam shovel men over tho question of wages. This trouble was settled satisfactorily to all parties and in July tho total ex cavation advanced materially and in August tho grand total from all points In the canal prism by steam shovels and dredges exceeded all previous United States records, reaching 1,274, 494 cubic yards. In September tills rec ord was eclipsed and a total of 1,617, 412 cubic yards was tomovod. Of this amount 1,481,307 cublo yards were from the canal prism and 36,105 cubic yards were from accessory works. These re sults were nchloved In the rainy sea son with a rainfall in August of 11.89 Inches and in September of 11.65 Inches. Finally, In October, tho record was again eclipsed, tho total oxcavatlon be ing 1,868,729 cublo yards; a truly ex traordinary record, especially in view ef tho heavy rainfall, which was 17,1 Inches. In fact, cxperlonco during the last two rainy seasons demonstrates that the rains are a less serious ob stacle to progress than has hitherto been supposed. "Work on tho locks and dams at Qatun, which began actively In March last, has advanced so far that it Is thought that masonry work on the locks ean bo bogun within 15 months. "Last wlntor bids wcro requosted and received for doing tho work of canal construction by oontract None of them was feund to be satisfactory ant all were rejected. It is tho unanimous opinion of tho prcsont commission that the work can be done bettor, more cheaply, and more quickly by the gov ernment than by prlvato contractors. Fully 80 per cent, of the entire plant needed for construction has been pur chased or contracted for; maohlne shops have bcon erected and equipped for making all needed ropalrs to the plant; many thousands of employes have been secured; an effective organi zation has beon perfected; a recruiting system Is In operation which Is capable of furnishing moro labor than oan be used advantageously; employes aro well sheltered and well fed; salaries paid are satisfactory, and tho work is not only going forward smoothly, but It is producing results far in advnnco of tho most sanguine anticipations. Under theso favorable oondltlens, a chango in the mothod of prosecuting tho work would be unwise and unjusti fiable, for it would inevitably disorgan ize existing conditions, check progress, and Increaso tho cost and lengthon tho tlma of completing tho canal. President Hccoimncnds Postal Savings Ilnnka. "I commend to tho favornblo consid eration of tho congress a postal sav ings bank system, as recommended by tho postmaator goneral. Tho primary object Is to encourage among our peo plo economy nnd thrift and by tho uso of postal savings banks to glvo thorn an opportunity to husband holr ro Bourccs, particularly thoso who havo not the facilities at hand for depositing their money In savings banks. Vlowod, however, from tho cxperlonco of the past fow weoks, it Is evident that tho advantages of such an institution aro still more far-ronchlng. Timid depos itors have withdrawn their savings for the tlmo being from national banks; In dividuals havo hoarded their cash and tho worklngmon their earnings; all Of which money .has bcon withdrawn and kept in hiding or In tho safo de posit box to tho detriment of pros perity. Through the agoncy of tho pos tal savings banks such money would be restored to tho channels of trado, to the mutual benefit of capital and labor. "I further commend to tho oongross the consideration of tho postmaster general's rcaommondatlon for nn ex tension of tho parcel post, especially on tho rural routes. There aro now 38, 215 rural routes, serving nearly 15,000, S00 people who do not havo tho ad vantages of the inhabitants of cities In obtaining their supplies. Theso recom mendations hnvo been drawn up to benefit tho farmer and the country storekeeper; otherwise, I should not favor them, for I bolteve that It is goed policy for our government to do ovory thlng possible to aid tho small town and tho country district. It is desirable that the country merchant should not bo crushed out. "Tho fourth-class postmasters' con vention has passed a vory strong reso lution In favor of placing tho fourth class postmasters under tho clvll-serv-lco law. Tho administration has al ready put into effect the policy .of re fusing to remove any fourth-class post masters save for reasons connected with the good of tho service; and It Is endeavoring so far as posslblo to re move them from the domain of partisan politics. It would be a most desirable thing to put tho fourth-class postmas ters In tho classified service. He renews his recommendations of last year in regard to Alaska; calls at tention to the admission of Oklahoma as u state; urges tho importance of pro viding shipping relief for Hawaii; asks for citizenship for Porto Rlcnns, and promises submission of Socrotary Taft's report on Philippines when that official returns. Ho asks for the creation of a bureau of mines; recommends tho providing of funds for preserving Tho Hermitage, the homo of Andrew Jackson; and tho erection of a naval monument at VIckHburg. Corporation Contributions to Campaign Expenses. "Under our form of government voting is not merely a right but a duty, and, moreover, a fundamental and necessary duty if a man is to be a good cltizon. It is well to provide that corporations shall not contribute to presidential or national campaigns, and furthermore to provide for the publication of both con tributions and expenditures. Thero is, however, always danger in laws of this kind, which from their very naturo are difficult of enforcement; tho danger being lest they bo obeyed only by tho honest, and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so as to act only as a penalty upon honest men. Moreover, no such law would ham per an unscrupulous man of unlimited means from buying his own way into of fice. There is a vory radical measure which would, I believe, work a substan tial Improvement in our system of con ducting a campaign, although I am well awaro that it will take some tlmo for people to so famlllarizo themselves with such a proposal as to bo willing to con sider Its adoption. The need for collect ing largo campaign funds would vanish It congress provided an appropriation for the proper and legitimate expenses of each of the great national parties, an ap propriation amplo enough to meet tho necessity for thorough organization and machinery, which requires a largo ex penditure of money. Then tho stipula tion should be mado that no party re ceiving campaign funds from the treasury should accept moro than a fixed amount from any Individual subscriber or donor; and the necessary publicity for receipts and expenditures could without difficulty bo provided." Wants Improvement In the Ocenn Mall Service. "I call your especial attention to tho un satisfactory condition of our foreign mall service, which, because of the lack of American steamship lines, Is now largely done through foreign linos, and which, particularly so far as South and Central America are concerned, Is dono In a man ner which constitutes a serious barrier to the extensions of our commerce. "The time has come, in my Judgment, to set to work seriously to 'make our ocean mall service correspond more closely with our recent commercial and political development. A beginning was made by the ocean mall act of March 3, 1X91, but even at that tlmo the act was known to be inadequate in various par ticulars. Since that time ovents have moved rapidly in eur history. We have acquired Hawaii, the Philippines,, and lesser Islands In the Pacific. AVe are steadily prosecuting the great work of uniting at the Isthmus tho waters of tho Atlantic and the Pacific. To a greater extent than Beemed probably oven a dozen years ago we may look to an American futuro on the sea worthy of the tradition of our past. As tho first step in that direction, and the step most feasible at the present time, I recommond tho extension of the ocoan mall act of 18M. That act has stood for some years free from successful criticism of its prin ciple and purpose. It was based on theo ries of the obligations of a great mari time nation, undisputed In our own land and followed by other nations since the beginning ef steam navigation. Briefly those theories are, that it Is tho duty of a first-class power so far as practicable to carry Its ocean malls under Its own flag; that the fast ocean steamships and their crews, required for such mall serv ice, are valuable auxiliaries to tho sea power of a nation. Furthermore, the construction of such steamships Insures the maintenance In an efficient 'condition of the shipyards In which our battleships must be built. "The expenditure of public money for tho performance of such necessary func tions of government Is certainly war ranted, nor is It necessary to dwell upon tho incidental benefits to our foreign commerce, to tho shipbuilding Industry, and te ship owning and navigation which will accompany the discharge of these urgent public duties, though they, too, should have weight," AWks Increase lu Pay for Army Ofllcem nnd Men. The president devotes much space to tho affairs of tho army, and strongly urges that our regular military organi zation be kept up to the highest posslblo standard of efficiency, and says: "The medical corps should be much greater than the needs of our regular army In war. Yet at present It Is small er than the needs of the service domand oven In pcaoe. The Spanish war oc curred less than ton years ago. The chief loss wo suffered in It was by dis ease among the regiments which never left the country. At the moment the nation seemed deeply Impressed by tbU fact; yet seemingly It has nlrendy been forgotten, for not tho slightest effort has been mado to prepnro a medical corps of BUirtclent stzo to prevont tho repetition of tho samo disaster on a much larger scale If we should over be engaged In n serious conflict. "But tho medical department Is not tho only dopnrtment for which Incroascd pro vision should bo mado. Tho rato of pay for the officers should bo greatly In creased; thero Is no higher typo of citizen than tho Amorlcan rogular officer, nnd ho should hnvo a fair reward for his ad mlrablo work. Thoro should bo a rela tively even greater Increase In tho pay for tho enlisted men. An cspoclal provision should be mado for establishing grades equivalent to thoso of warrant olllcors In the navy, which should bo open to tho enlisted mrn who servo sufficiently long and who do their work well. Inducements should bo offered sufficient to encourago roally good men to mako tho nrmy a llfo occupation. Tho prlmo needs of our pres ent army Is to securo and rotaln compe tent noncommissioned officers. This diffi culty rests fundamentally on tho ques tion of pay. Tho noncommissioned officer does not correspond with an unskilled la borer; ho corresponds to tho best typo of skilled workman or to tho subordlnato official In civil Institutions. Wagc3 havo greatly Increased In outsldo occupations In tho last 40 years and the pay of tho soldier, like the pay of tho officers, should bo proportionately Increased. The first sergeant of a company, If a good man. must bo ene of such oxccutlvo and ad ministrative ability, and such knowledgo of his trade, as to bo worth far moro than wo at present pay him. Tho samo Is truo of the regimental sergeant major. These men should bo men who had fully rev solved to make tho army a llfo occupa tion and thoy should bo able to look for ward to ample roward; whllo only men properly qualified should bo given a chnnce to securo theso final rewards, Tho Increase over the present pay need not be great In the lower grades for tho first eno or two enlistments, but tho Increaso should bo marked for tho noncommis sioned ofTlcers of tho upper grades who Berve long enough to mako It evident that they Intend to stay permanently In tho army, whllo additional pay should bo given for high qualifications In target practice. "Among tho offlcors thero should bo severo examinations to woed out tho unfit up to the grado of major. From that position on appointments should bo solely by selection and It should bo understood that a man of morely av erago cnpaclty could never got beyond the position of major, whllo ovory man who serves In any grade a certain length of tlmo prior to promotion to the next grade without getting tho promotion to tho next grado should bo forthwith retired." President Sees Pfecd of Lnrsrely Increased Nnvy. The president nsks for a continuous Increase In the navy, and aaks present congress for appropriations for four new battleships, and says: "Wo need always to romember that In tlmo of war the navy la not to bo used to defond harbors and sea-coast altles; wo should perfect our system of coast fortifications. Tho only efficient use for tho navy is for offense. Tho only way In which it can efficiently pro tect our own const against tho posslblo action of a foreign navy is by destroy ing that foreign navy. For dofenso against a hostllo fleet which actually attacks them, tho coast cities must de pend upon their forts, mines, torpodoes, submarines and torpedo bonts and do stroyers. All of theso together nre ef ficient for defensive purposes, but thoy In no way auDDly tho placo of n thor oughly efficient navy capable of acting on tho offensive; for parrying nover yet won a fight. It can only bo won by hard httlng, and an aggressive sea-going navy alone can do this hard hitting of tho offensive type. But tho forts and the like nro necossary so that tho navy may bo footloose. In tlmo of war there Is sure to bo demand, under pres sure of fright, for the ships to be scat tered so as to defend nil kind of ports. Under penalty of terrlblo disaster, this demand must bo refused. Tho ships must bo kept together, nnd their ob jective made the enemies' fleet. If fortifications are sufficiently strong, no modern navy will venture to attack them, so long as the foe has In exist ence a hostile navy of anything liko the same size or efficiency. But unless thero exists such a navy then tho forti fications aro powerless by themselves to securo the victory. For of courso the mere deficiency means that any resolute enemy can at his leisure com bine all his forces upon ono point with the certainty that he can take it. Given Ilenaons for Despatch Of Fleet to Ike PaclHc. "Until our battle fleet Is much larger than at present it should never bo split Into detachments so far apart that thoy could not in event of omorgency bo speedily united. Our coast lino is on the Pacific Just as much as on tho At lantic. Tho Interests of California, Oregon and Washington aro as em phatically tho interests of tho wholo union as thoso of Malno and Now York, ef Louisiana and Texas. Tho battlo fleet should now and then bo moved to tho Pnclflc, Just as at other times it should be kept in tho Atlnntlc. When tho Isthmian canal Is built tho transit of the battle fleet from one ocean to the other will be comparatively easy. Until it is built I earnestly hope that the battlo fleet will bo thus shifted be tween the two oceans ovory year or two. The marksmanship on all our ships has Improved phenomenally dur ing the last Ave years. Until within the last two er threo years It wns not possible to train a battle fleet In squad ron maneuvers under service conditions, nnd It Is enly during these last two or three years that tho training under theso conditions has become really af fective. Another and most necessary strldo in ndvance is now being taken. Tho battle fleet is about starting by the Straits of Magellan to visit tho Pacific coast. Sixteen battleships aro going under tho command of Hear Ad miral Evans, while eight armored cruisers and two ether battleships will meet him at San Francisco, whither certain torpedo destroyers are also go ing. No fleet of such size has ever mado such a voyage, an It will be of very great educational uso to all en gaged in It. The enly way by which to teach officers and men hew to handlo tho fleet so as to meet every posslblo strain and emergency In tlmo of war is to have them praotloe under similar conditions in time ef peaoe. Moreover, tho only way to find out our actual needs Is to perform in tlmo of peace whatever maneuvers might bo neces sary in time ef war. Aftor war it, de clared it Is too lata to find out the. needs; that means to invite disaster. The trip to tho Paclflo will show what somo of our noeds are and will enablo us to provide for them. Tho proper place for an officer to learn his duty is at sea, and tho only way in which a navy can ever be mado efficient Is by practice at sea, under all tho condi tions which would have to bo met if war existed." Ho reviews tho work accomplished by tho second poaco conference at Tho Hague; notes tho Improvement of af fairs in Cuba, and tho preparations be ing mado to reestablish tho govern ment of the island republla; asks per mission to cancel the remainder of China's Indemnity obligation to us, and rovlows the effect of Secrotary Boot'a visit to Mexico.- THEODOnE
