' Gossip of the Street fJlHB recommendatloni of tlio Interstate Commerce Commission on the - railroad situation continued to lie the chief topic of discussion In tlio financial districts both uptown unci downtown yesterday. The falling off In prices of rnllroud shares from the npectaculnr Rain of Wednesday afternoon, following the first announcement from the commission, was not considered ory strlou, nnd was. In fact, anticipated In many quarters. 801110 bankers nnd brokers hIIII remain pessimistic on the railroad Ituatton and expect ConRrosi to tear the recommendations to ribbons. They argue that attacking the railroads has always been n popular "Indoor sport" for many members, and as quite a number will soon have to go before their constituents for re-election they will resort to the did plan of pleasing the people, They also say that the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission Is an acknowledgment on their part of tho erroneous stand they took In their previous lewn on the railroad Ituatlon, and that they now rculUo that their former decisions liao hamstrung the roads until the nation's transportation sstcm has broken down. As u rule, those who put forward these arguments also believe that a long light on the subject Is ahead before Congress decides what really shall bo done. On tho other hand, there arc those who can see nothing but good In the situation. They bcllcMi that Congress will recognize the necessity of quick action, that no time will be lost In llndlng out President Wilson's "Views on the matter, which they claim undoubtedly must be In uccord with those of the interstate commission nnd that In nil probability tho ntlre matter may bo left In the President's hands to act as he believes best. But it Is notorious tHat ecn with those In favor of tho recom mendations, oh well us those, who have llttlo conlldenco of their enactment, thero Is a feeling that a new board made up of men of broudcr lews than the present Interstate commission should bo appointed to say what thould be done to completely solve the problem. No one Is Interested In the question of freight rates or whether there will or will not bo any necessity for a belated decision on the pending ease. It is completely overshadowed by the bigger proposition of Imme diate financial assistance for the railroads by the Government on a grand cale to enable them to mdet pressing requirements, and to get the most service out of them In the prosecution of the war. J That no further action would be taken by the Interstate Commerce Commission until Congress Is heard from on tho subject Is the general belief. The commission's report said: "Wo uro sensible of tho vital and Imperative need of tho hour that our railroads shall not bo permitted to become less cfllcleut or less suf. flclent. Wo realize tho gravity of a serious breakdown of our trans portation facilities. It is unthinkable that this breakdown would be permitted If It could bo prevented. Increased charges for carriage It found necessary to take oaro of unavoidable Increases In operating ex penses would not at this tlmo bring new capital on reasonable terms In Important sum's. In our opinion tho sltuutlon does not permit tempo rizing. All anergics must be devoted to bringing tho wur to a successful conclusion, and to that end It Is necessary that our transportation systems b placbd und kept on the plane of highest clllclency." Talk of Trade-Acceptance Move Here' There Is a rumor that certain well-known New York llnuucial con cerns which arc represented In this city are making preparations to transact a big business In trade acceptances after tho first of next year. There ils u great deal of Interest manifested In financial circles us to tho working out of the trade acceptances In the United States. Some fear that tho trade acceptance will bo used to shift from the seller to tho bank tho burden of carrjlng merchants who fall to take offered cash discounts. The whole commercial fabric, of any nation Is built up on the Integrity of Its merchants, and those who argue ugulnst the trade acceptance most strongly seem to leave the Integrity of tho great mass of American busi ness men out of tho question altogether. If tho use of the trade accep tance uncovers the men whose Integrity is nil, then It will have accom plished one good purpose. ., Tho trade acceptance, before It ever reaches tho Federal Itc&erve bank for rediscount If It ever reaches it has necessarily been sub jected to tho scrutiny of the seller's banker, otherwise he would not have discounted It in the ttrst-placu, -uml It must again bo subjected to a more rigid scrutiny by the same banker before he would present it to his federal Ilescrvo bank for rediscount. Of course, tho question of ability, an well as Integrity, cittern Into the question, but there Is where tho func tion und good Judgment of tho banker comes Into pluy. The seller with whom the acceptunco originates Is also u buyer, perhaps of the raw materials used In manufacture, and he will also be called upon to accept notes for the transactions Involving the purchase uf these In all prob ability. It might be belter, but not so convenient, to have all acceptances "bank acceptances," where the bank loans Its credit to Its customers, and In whlch'cuse the bank would perhaps use more discretion In the creation of the paper. 1 Reserve Board Approves Discount Rise To prevent possible Inflation and In tho Interest of sound business Conditions, the Federal 'Reserve Board has approved a general Increase In discount rates of about one-half of 1 per cent for tho greater part of the twelve Federal Reserve banks. On fifteen-day paper. Including member banks' collateral notes, tha new rales aro 4 per cent for all banks except lit New York, where It Is 3 per cent. For fifteen to sixty day paper tho new rates are 4 per cent for all banks except In New York, which Is I per cent, und Chicago and Minneapolis, which are G per cent. Formerly rates on this paper ranged between 4 and 4 per cent. ' For agricultural and live stock puper more than ninety days the new rates are 5 per cent, except for Richmond, which Is 4S, and for Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and San Francisco, which are 51J Per cent. Little change has been madu In fifteen-day paper secured by certifi cates' of Indebtedness or Liberty Bonds, rates remaining at 3H per cent for all banks except In New York, where It Is 3 per cent. For fifteen to ninety'foy paper of the same class the new rate Is 1 per cent, except for New York, which la Si per cent. ' , Trade acceptances, one to sixty dajs, now bear 4 per cent, except In New York, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco, where they are 3 per cent. The former general rate was 3H per cent. For sixty to ninety day acceptances the new rale Is 4 per cent, except for New York, which Is 3'4 Per cent. ' Citizens Must Save to Supply U. S. Needs , There could be no greater fallacy than that the Government could ftAance Itself during this war period, or at uny other time, by creating Its necessary purchasing; power by paper money, and yet this Idea Is very prevalent 'among all classes. The purchasing power of the Government must be created by our own citizens, and the proper method Is by tho Individual citizen creating u bunk credit through saving, and when tlie proper time comes by transferring that credit to lite Government In exchange for Government securities, tho Government hi turn transferring that credit by the payments for war materials of every description and ' all Its other expenses. ' The difficult part of this problem Is the getting of the average citizen to comprehend ho must create the means to supply the Government's needs by saving. This matter was very btrongly emphasized by Beerelary of the Troas- , ury McAdoo In submitting his annual report to Congress, which shows that 16,128.208,793 must be provided In addition to funds from taxes ' and bond issues ulready authorized to make the estimates for the ilscul year ending June 3D, 1818, equal the disbursements, li his report Mr. McAdoo says: "So far us I have been able to convey, the American people are not sufficiently aroused to the necessity of economy and, of saving In this really serious time, not only In the life of America, but of the nations of the world. Up, to the present there has been a relatively small denial of pleasures, comforts and conveniences 01 tho pari of the average citizen. lf is drawing upon the general store of supplies In the country with almost the same freedom as before .America came Into the war. This cannot continue Without serious hurt to the nation und to the world. iljhe gretit financial operations of the Government cannot be carried forward successfully unless the people of the United States economize In iyery possible direction, save their money and lend It to the Government.' " U) easy to visualize the course of a dollar saved from waste and Invested In Government bonds. First, It goes to the Government as a loan fr war; secdnd, It la expended by the Government for food, clothing and ', ammunition, which go directly to a gallant soldier or sailor, whose fighting i strength Is kept tip by the food, Whose body is kept warm by the clothing, :' Md Whose enemy Is hit by the ammunition. It has not been expended In purcnose 01 neeaieas 100a anq lore, released for the use or. :wj in Commerce Commis ciovnins jor we man m iiuinc, ana e. the soldier; it ta saved wealth to the H"ir.fflSHE? 5 "L ?

Vnnderlip DIscushcs Finunce With Insurance Heads NHW YOltK, Dec. 7. "The Government today would like Ltn be spending on domestic war needs a billion dollars h month," Frank A. Vanderllp said lit the annual meeting nf Ihe life Insurance presidents In the Hotnl Aslor here. "But ns a matter of fact." he went on, "the month of October closed with expenditures of about 1460.000,000. Tn November, still with an estimate of spending a billion dollars, the mouth closed with expenditures of a little more than IBOO.000.ooo. What was the reason? It was that the workshops could not produce the things tho Oov eminent wanted as rapidly as they had con tracted to do. It wan n question of man power and Industrial organization" He continued: "So the great thing joti can do to help win this war Is to get this Idea of per sonal responsibility over to as many per sons ns vou can. so that their personal conduct win tie Influenced, so that when they have n dollar to spend they will weigh, not whether thev can afford to spend It In the way they desire, but whether the Clov eminent can nfford to have thorn spend It In the way they de sire ' .Mr Vnnderlip, although president of the National City Hank, is for the pioscnt getting only $1 a car ns chair man of the tlovcrimient's war-savings (oininlttce He paid the Insurance companies a great compliment "not becauso they have piled up accumulations that ure measured In hundreds of millions, but because they have contributed u lesson lu teaching personal thrift." Ho added: "However long the war may last and however great may bo Ils cost, every dollar of tlmt cost call be recomnensed If these lessons of thrift can be taught tliorouglily tn nil or us. Tlie real proD lem Is not dnllnrs. It Is things, inanil fuclured things. That Is what we'vo got to have to support our armv. A substantial part of the $19,000.(100,000 ou have seen Congress appropriate is for things out of our workshops. This Is u war of workshops to an extent never Known m any struggle nerore me measure of our strength, of the force of the blow wo aro going to strike, will be tne amount tlie worxsunps can iirouuce for the purpose of the (lov eminent, "Wo have got lo learn the greatest lesson In economy that was ever taught a people, because thero Is not enough labor mid material, not enough shops to produce this huge amount of things unless every one of us feels the respon sibility for personal economy. I believe tne campaign we aro inaugurating, ir it can be brought, as I think It will be, sharply to the attention of tho whole leople, will result not only In the free us of labor and materials sudlclent for Cov eminent needx, but will stamp the nation, the national character, with something more permanent than tho hor rible enects or war. .Mr. Vanderllp cuprcsscd abhorrence of tho Idea of "flnancliiK the war with Ihe printing press" sonio form of paper money Ho believed that all history hail no example of the disaster that fol lows an unredeemable paper Issuo to- dav, when thero are outstanding billions of sccuiitles Issued by public service corporations whoso expenditure would bo Inflated In cost by any Inflation of the currency, but whose Income Is fixed by contract or governmental regulation. Ho snld: "All men who aro fnteresteil In the existing order of things must at the present time be doubly Interested In seeing that our financial cost Is driven along sound lines, that the means which the (lovernment must have are raised In sound money, that we do not drift off Into any consideration of 'doing It In the easiest way. " Herbert Quick urged the life Insurance, companies to add to their Investment of $700,000,000 farm mortgage loans. He said: "No greater problem ever confronted the American people than the necessity which is now upon us of gradually changing from a wasteful and destruc tive agricultural policy to one which must he based upon tha two somewhat antagonistic requirements of Increasing production and tho maintenance of per manent soil fertility. For the economic pinch Ik now upon us. It has come upon us almost with the suddenness of a thunderbolt. "The fact may be noted here that the life Insurance companies of the United states Imve. loaned on real estate about one-third of their funds I am advised that 40 per cent or inese real estate leans are on farm property. In amount these farm mortgage loans of the life Insuranco companies lotay about J700, 000,000 The Insuranco companies have thus recently become the largest dls tlngulshable factor In tho farm loaji business, "A railroad company, a street car company, h hydroelectric plant or any other great Industrial or transportation project must be financed by the advance ment of money on the basis of perma nent or semipermanent Investment. The tlmo has come for a recognition of the fact that tho operations of the farmer require an equally long period, of time." Ocorge r Ide said that tho life Insur ance men Tj? tho country wcro ready and eager lo lend to the Oovernment all the assistance In their power In connec tion vvltli the plan of governmental In surance for soldiers and bailors. He continued: As to the general plan, lt Is one that intist nunenl to everv natrlotlc citizen. The purpose of devising eomo plan that will provide for every member of the fighting force a guarantee that his de pendents will be taken care of properly in event of any calamity arising to him from war service Is un eminently praise worthy one. , Use Sugar Sparingly- Not Waste It Everyone manufacturers and householders should use sugar sparingly for the present. The supply is limited and will be until the new crop of cane can be harvested and shipped from Cuba and the Tropics. The supply will then be ample. In the meantime, the people of the New England and Atlantic Coast States should use sugar sparingly. i i Grocers should limit their sales to any one family. No one should hoard or waste sugar.

RAILROAD ISSUE c-.'1 M. UP TO PRESIDENT Wilson to Decide Whether Government Shall Seize Carriers LABOR OPPOSES PLAN CHICAGO, Dec. 7. Actual (iovcrnment operation of railroads would result In failure, ac cording to a Htulemcnl made al San Bernardino, Cal by E. 1. Itlplcy, president of the Santa IV. A rail road is a great scientific industry; a Government is n political machine. A political machine can never suc ceed in the management of a great industry. WAHlllNVSTO.W Dec. 7. (Jovcrnnient operations of railroads hung In the balance today. On tho Ux ecutlvo In tho White llouso depended whether tho fiovcrninent should lend tho rtllrosd companies $1,000,000,000 or put the roads under a. Federal "dictator" tr end the war freight jam. Some Congressmen 'looked for Presi dent Wilson to seize control of tho rail roads before Christmas, They predicted that legislation for unification of the lines would mean a. long deliy Tho President, on tho other hand, desires Im mediate relief lrom railroad congestion Under authority he already possesses ho could pliuo every mile uf track under Federal control by a pen's stroke. However, the four rullroid brother hoods nre united vvltli railway executives against Oov eminent control. Piesldent Wilson Is understood to have been told this when the labor leaders saw him recently regarding their wago demands. The brotherhoods favor llniuclal and legislative aid to Ihe carriers to enable them to unity tholr operations, ns sug gested by the Interstate Commerce Com mission, under direction of u war board. The railroad executives today were prepnrlng estimates of tho amount needed for 1018 to placo tho lines on vvnr efficiency basis. Theso estimates nre to bo submitted to Senator New lands for presentation by him to tho President on Monday. The President Is shortly nttcrwnrd expected fo mako known his owsi, possibly In a, special message to Congress. Legislators said they would follow the President's recommendation. One Sena tor, n labor- sponsor, even said ho would vote for nn antl-sti Ike bill If the Presi dent wished It, although In tho Sena tor's opinion such legislation "might precipitate a labor revolution." Acting Chairman Sims, of tho House Interstate Commerce Committee, favors Immediate action by tho President to scl7e tho railroads. "Then ho could come to Congress for supplemental legislation to guarantee railroad securities or whatever measures ndvlsable," said Shus. "It would tako sin months to enact trie Interstate Com merce Commission's recommendations for unltlcatlon under the railroads' own rontrol. Clov eminent loans would he fraught with proposals nnd counter proposals." Ono of the leaders of tho railway organization. In discussing tho situation with Senators who uro members cf the Interstate commerce committees, nnd who will have to pass the legislation to meet the railway crisis, outlined his position In n memorandum as follows "Hallway employes' wages today arc rar nelovv tho llgure that everyday laborers are receiving In certain lcvall- lies, desplto the fact that railway men must, tie especially trained and of ,i high order of Intelligence. The brother hoods havo asked for Increased wagea so mat their membership can get suf. flclent money to llvu on. It already Is plain that tha railroads will rcfuso to meet the demands of the men. Now, rf Iho Ooumr.ient takes ever the roads il will bo as a war measure, lt already is almost certain that they will be operated along mllltnry lines. In fact. army ofllclaln have Intimated that the engineering hrnuccs of the nriuy will be given at least a g-neinl oversight over the operations of the roads. "In addition It Is certain that Presi dent Wilson never has completely aban doned the suggestion that he mado ut tne tlmo we wero negotiating for tlie lost wage advance that the roads ought to be considered ft part of the mllltury system and tho men denied tho right to abandon their employment at will."
