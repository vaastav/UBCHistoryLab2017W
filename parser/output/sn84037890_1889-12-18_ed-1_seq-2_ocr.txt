OTHER SIDE. In general disciiiou, the exclusion question has been Few, if any, sided with the Chinese. The question has been receiving some considerable attention of late, nnd particularly by the boards of trade and chambers of commerce. It has been ctistomnry to favor Chinese exclusion, nnd few have even considered tlieinilueiiceon American commerce. The New York Chamber of Conimerco has been examining the Chinese question for a year or more and have summed up their opinions in the following letter: "It seems, that without utter ins a wonl or lilting a linger the Chinese are eiiablcil to retaliate, effectively against our commerce, so that no have not only ollered them a wanton atl'ront, but also injured ourselves in a twofold way by excluding a tractable and cheap labor, which wo very much heed to build up our desolate plaees.aml h.v the loits of a valuable trade, which miizht have kept to the exclusion of our rivals. "A Kcntluuiiin direct from Chinese and Japanese Krts telhi mo that since the news ot the nssii:ro of the Inclusion Act reached China, American uaents there linvo been unable to sell auy of the courser cotton textile fabrics, of which they have been taking largo quantities. "Their wants uro supplied from other bourees - Knclaud, I suppose. They offer no explanation for this change of policy, bat simply say they are not buy-ins. Just ns hooii as they can supply themselves with petroleum from Asias-tic oil wells, we may expeet that trade to follow. Clocks anil machinery eau be supplied by the nnd Germans, who would bo glad to relievo us of the traile. "The ten, inuttingM, raw silks and other commodities which we need and can buy nowhere else, Americans will have tu pay tor in coin or exchange oil ijomtun, when vvo milit have paid for iiiein with our own products. This view of the subject is entitled togteat respect, especially so since it comes from a hod v of men whose connection with tlie business world enables them toohseivc the clib mid How of the ocean of commerce. Intelligent discussion of the subject will at least do no harin. A SUCCESSFUL FIRM. The lirm of Klein- linns A; Simousoii of Louisville, have opened up in their new inmnuioth biisine.s ITpon the occasion of their oiieiiinir, thev imvo u "colla tinn" to the press, Mr. hjiiiionniu, in his speech to the members of the press, said : "I'ublieity is essential to success, and that can only bo obtained through the column of the press. Wo came to this city a few; years njto strangers and almost Tti)itilcHH, and whatever success wo have obtained or whatever prosperity wo have enjoyed, we feel wo ovvu in a largo degree to the press of this city nnd surrounding coutitiy. Through you wo wore introduced to and became ac quainted with the people, ion reeoni mended and indorsed us, and it was from tlie many kuul and llatteriug notices that we received at your bauds that the people learned to know, have confidence in and patronize us. During all these years wo have enjoyed your friendship and have had your hearty co-operation, without which wo would have failed ami with it wo have succeeded beyond our most sanguine expectations. A merchant must keep liis business before the puhlio if ho would succeed; and that can only ho douo through the columns of the press. Advertisements are the thermometers of commercial activity. No man in nchs can expect tlio pationago of tho public that does not himself patroui.o till! iress.'

Sir. ' Slmniison'pives the living ideAiii the' hiisiuess world m hen he further siy: "The largo and increasing number nf business men tlint liavc become nnd me becoming rich, prosicnus and influential, testify to this truth. Ho that today nil successful business men tlie fact that advertising is tlie cniel element of a litisiness mans sue' noooiiy else noes. tions mid the great part played in the crunmercial world by the Hotu merchant, he turned his attention to tlie crying need of theprcsent day ballot reform., He said: "Political seltlshiicss cheapens in the minds of the people their iipprchcnviou of the character and functions of tho Government; it distorts every conception of the duty of good citizenship nnd creates nu ntuiospheie in which iniquitous purposes nnd designs loo their odious features. It begins when n judgment is won to the theory that political action may bo used solely for private gain and advantage, aud when n tender conscience is quieted by the ingenious argument that such gain and advantage are identical with tlie public welfare. This stage having been reached and self-interest being now fully aroued, agencies aro used and practices permitted in the accomplishment of its purposes, uliich seen in tho pure light ot disinterested patriotism, nre viewed with fear and hatred. Tho in dependent thought anil free political preference of thoso whom late has made dependent iqiou daily toil for bread, aro strangled and destroyed by intimidation nnd tho fear of tho loss of employment. lie unsavory forms riso to tho surface of our agitated political waters, and gleefully tin ticipato in theanxiety of seltish intercut, their opportunity to fatten tixm corrupted and debauched suffrage." Again after contrasting the, mo lives of citizens with the great principle of patriotism he proceeds; "Let us look with a degree of pity nnd charityupou those who yield to fear and intimidation in the exercise of their right of Miftrage. Though they ought not thus to yield, we can not forget that against their free ballot, they see in tho scale their continued employment, the commits of their homes and the maintenance of their families. We need not to stillo our scorn and contempt for the wretch who basely sells his vote, and who. for a bribe, betruvs his trust of citizenship. Aud yet the thought will intrude itself, that ho but follows, in a low vulgar fashion, the example of thoso who proceed upon the theory that political action may be turned to private gain. Hut whether vre pity or whether we hate, our betrayal is nono tho less com piete; nor win either pity or liato re- storo our birthright. Hut vve know that when political seltlshness is destroyed, our dangers will disappear; and though the way to its stronghold mav Im Ioiil' and weary, wowill follow it lighting as no go. Thero will bo no sunender, nor win tneio do desertions tromour ranks. Selfishness and corruption have not yet achieved a lusting triumph aud their bold deliancu will but hasten tho day of their destruction. "As we struggle on mid confidently a direct contltct witli these entrenched foes of our political safety, we have not failed to see another hope which has manifested itself to all tho honest people of the land. It teaches them that though they may not immediately destroy at their sourco tho evils which alllict tlieiu, they may check their miilisu inlliienco and "Hard them selves ngainst their baneful results. It assures them that if political virtue and rectitude cannot at once be thor oughly restored to tho republic, tho activity of baser elements may be discouraged. It inspires them with vigilant watchfulness and a determination to prevent as far as possible their treacherous betrayal by those who are false to the obligations of citizenship. "Tliis hone, risen like tho Star in thn Kust, has fixed tho garo of our pattiotic and everywhere in our oiisy marts oi trade and on our farms- in our citiesaudiu ourvillages in the duelling of tho rich and in tho homes of the poor -in our universities and in our workshops -in our banking houses mid in the ranks of inexorable toil -they greet with enthusiastic no-claim tho advent of Jiallot lteform.

BALLOT REFORM. (J rover Cleveland in private life like (trover Clevehitid as President, never makes it sp?eeh that he doi's not leave :i thought to history. At u nierchanl's hanipiel where Henry V. (Irady, Andrew Carni gie and V. L. I'utmau were honor, ed guests and orators, Cleveland made the speech of the. evening on Ballot Heform. After reviewing the conditions of our commercial rela ill Kentucky, to correct nnd ex tit the poiiiliirs(iitiiiieiit abovethcilemtiiil for personal revenue ami desperate idjittt uietilM ot personal iiiiterence. Dr. ,T. M. Pendleton, whose years have added honor to his name without en fcobliug his frame nor beclouding his intellect nor abating his devotion to the Truth. And Dr. J. V. Warder, whoso name will long awaken delightful recollections in .Missouri, and whoso work has so intimately .mil prominently associated him with Kentucky ISaptists. He led ino into an acquaintance with the theory and workings of the "Kentucky Plan" for mission work aud general missionary benevolence. I am impressed that Kentucky Baptists have probably solved the problem of ri.vNS. Consecration with harmonious co-operation is the end to bo sought, which when attained must remove and avoid friction, as well as promote system and efficiency. Jinny minds in ninny states are watching tho working of the Kentucky Plan. And Dr. J. S. Coleman- of whom, more presently. The isiwer of this man iu building up, establishing and making efficient the Baptist cause in the Oreen Hivcr nud southwestern portions of Kentucky, must become historic. Many preacher of other denominations as well ns our own -with whom 1 conferred, unite in their testimony to the vast au 1 abiding inlliienco of Dr. Coleman in giving supremacy to Baptist principles in this country. Aud A. 11. Smith, whom I have loved for a third of a century, because he is in Pltriut tmnliln Ati.1 .T.il.n rP r..u. .!.?.. and E. II. Maddux, and Fred Hale, aud uro.

Ho has somo raro gifts. lam delighted to learn through the Recorder of the results of that meeting. Pro. Casebier, vviiom I had not sceu since he was a timid Timothy, has grown in power every way -physically, spiritually and cheerfully. I was impressed by the culture, dignity and manner of Hro. Hisu Maddox. I was present nt the dedication of the new Baptist house of worship at Hartford, and also at the dedication of the remarkable and improved house at Greenville. To speak nt length of these houses would presume too largely iqiou your generosity aud the patience of youi readers. The house, nt Hnrtford is a model of economy in expenditure, where the size and substantiaiiiess, etc., charming finish and elegant tiuruisli ing are all considered. The strong substructure, and tho beautiful superstructure ornamented with turrets, and spire, the walla rendered almost resplendent by the artistic tintsnnd bliodcs of pure cathedral glass set with irniHirtcd opalescent jewels iu six side windows.nud the front massive memorial window with a condonation of tho brilliant and soft, tho bold and gentle cathedral glass with iuterspersion of panca bearing beautiful inscriptions of appropriate Scriptures and Christian mottoes, strike the observer into delightful amazement. 1'ho inside vestibule, auditorium, or gan loft, exquisite pulpit, neat nnd comfortable chair sittings, elaborate pulpit chairs, baptistry, auto and rooms, aud all so adjusted that the appointments are complete iu proportions mid conveniences. Ono is made to wonder, how could all this be obtained for S7,0iH)l A compliment to tho t wu, a credit to the building committee and a commentary upon the executive ability of the pastor. The house at Greenville is elegantly unpretentious. It cannot fail to impress one by its exhibit of cultured taste. It is as u neatly attired retined woman, whose sweet temper, unsullied virtue and modest culture lieams from eyery feature. Tho office, robiug rooms, pulpit mid sittings of this house aro better than those of the Hartford house. Tins propeity is worth not less than 37,000. A prominent lawyer said to mo: "So man but J. S. Coleman could linvo accomplished theso wonders." What a contribution to tho progress of ourcauseintheOreeu Hiver Country I Yet ono thing remains to bo douo provide for more frequent use of theso excellent houses. Why so much out-lay of money and such exhibit of taste for only ono service a month in each? Hartford anil Greenville should combine nnd use all of Dr. Cole man tune between them. Knch church needs more freonelit nreueliiinr. mora pastor tal work and greater 'organized ellort tor nn nggressivo work. I am sure the two chinches can raise money enough to pay their pastor for all of his time. This arrangement would bo a loss to historic old Beaver Dam and enterprising Whitesville, but theso churches could make tho sacrifice in the general interests of the Redeemer's kingdom.
