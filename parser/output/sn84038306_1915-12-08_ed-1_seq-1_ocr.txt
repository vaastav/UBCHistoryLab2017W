Second Number of Entertainment Course, High School Assembly Room, Saturday Evening, Dec. 11th OLLOWING is tbe message or President Wilson delivered at a joint session of the senate and bouse at the beginning of the Sixty-fourth congress: Gentlemen of the Congress—Since I last had the' privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union the war of nations on the other side of the sea. which had then only begun to disclose its portentous proportions, has extend ed its threatening and sinister scope until it has swept within its flame some portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemi sphere, has altered the whole face of international affairs, and now presents a prosnect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to, attempt before. The president tells how this country practiced neutrality and declares that he hopes that when tlie time comes for readjustment a»d recuperation this country will be of infinite service. Re ferring to Central and South American problems, the president declares that we should retain unabated the spirit which has inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. We ttave been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mex ico by the course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take advan tage of her in her distress and under take to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Lib erty is oftep a tierce and intractab^?!' .•thing., to which, no. braoif apdvtcr no of 

PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE TO SIXTY-FOUOTB CONGRESS NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS MAIN THEME OF HEAD OF NATION SUBMITS DEFINITE PLAN TO INCREASE STANDING FORCE OF REGULARS AND 400,000 CITIZEN SOLDIERS. DECLARES GREATEST BANGER TO COUNTRY FROM WITHIN ITS BORDERS Declares That If Full Navy Program is Carried We Will Have Fleet- For Defense That Will be "Fitted to Our Needs and Worthy of Our Traditions." J15d«nds*^bf men's choosing ought ever, to be set Every American who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tra dition must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Vir ginia bill of rights, which in the great days in which our government was set up was everywhere among us accept ed as the creed of free men. That doc trine is, "That government Is or ought to be instituted for the common bene fit. protection and security of the peo ple. nation or community that "of •all the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is apable a few producing tlie greatest de­ gree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, and that when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of tbe community liath an indubitable, inalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it in such manner as shall be .judged.'most conducive-to the public weal." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to- the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical but nec essary process. We will aid and be friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her. and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer ica that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control. 

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT. Economic Adjustments Inevitable With in the Next Generation. The moral is that the states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but co-op erating friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of interest, alike in matters political and in mat ters economic, is likely to give them a new significance as factors in interna tional affairs and in the political his tory of the world. It presents them as in a very deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking to gether. quick with common sympathies and common ideals. Separated, they are subject to all the cross currents of the confused politics of a world of bos rile rivalries: united in spirit and pur pose. they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny. This is pan-Americanistn. It has none of the spirit of empire in it. It is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and independence and liberty and mutual service. The president calls attention to the meeting in Washington recently of representatives of the pan-American republics and says that economic ad justment is inevitable in the next gen eration. No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we are appointed to speak can fail to per ceive that their passion is for peace, their genius best displayed in the prac tice of the arts of peace. Great democ racies are not belligerent. They do nol seek or desire war. Their thought if of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and the un censored thought that quickens it. Conquest and dominion ore not in our Photo by American Assgtgl^tlon. 

PRESIDENT WILS^JI'S LATEST PICTURE! (From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.) reckoning or agreeable to our princi ples. But just because we demand up molested development and the undis turbed. government of .oury. own^ttyes. ^OjQ out oira-principles pf^ r|glijp«£d .liberty, we® resenti' froia whatever quarter it may come,r the aggression' we ourselves will not practice. We Insist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for Individual liberty^.and free national development to the inci dents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wher ever there Is a people that tries to walk in these difficult paths of independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed it as important that our neigh bors should bo free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be: have sot America aside as a whole for the uses of independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a peo ple against aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta-, torial power within oar own nation as of aggression from without. We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war. 

SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. Increase Standing Regular Force—Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers. But war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined might If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, aud what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately avail able and immediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it. The military arm of tlieir government, which they will not allow to direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make their independence secure, and not their own independence merely, but the rights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the world, and particularly in this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle and by chastened am bition to play. It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the department of Avar more adequate national defense were conceived which will be 'laid before you. and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as be properly scrutinized and discussed They seem to me the essential first steps, and they seem to me for the present sufficient. They contemplate an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 offi cers and 102,985 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7,136 officers and 134.707 enlisted men, or 141.S43 all told, all services, rank and Jile. by the addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four *«giments of field artillery and four ero squadrons, besides 750 officers re juired for a great variety of extra (Contin-td on page 8.) for soon as they can NO 49 —Mrs. B.

Large crowds were on the ice* Sunday afternoon, and although the ice is thin in many places none of the skaters broke through the thin coating. At Cedar Falls the river claimed one victim on Sunday, and skaters on the Maquoketa will do well to be cautious in venturing on ice in the main channel of the river. OH
