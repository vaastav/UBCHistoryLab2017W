The Superior Times VOL. XXX\. XO. 1(>. From the State Capital Items of Importance to Wisconsin People, Gleaned at Madison. Madison. —The country life commis sion appointed by President Roosevelt to receive views of the people on needs and methods of improving life in the country Monday transmitted the following opinion to the president as representing the situation in Wiscon sin; “What Wisconsin farmers want — Good roads, parcel posts, post a 1 sav ings banks, a postal t%legraph. What the farmers need —The promotion of the intellectual understanding.’’ The commission Saturday listened to sev eral speakers well acquainted with conditions in Wisconsin. The members of the commission present were; Dean L. H. Bailey of Cornell College of Ag riculture, chairman ;* Henry Wallace of Des Moines, la., A. .), Heard of Sacra mento, Cal., C. J. Blanchard, statisti cian of the United Stales reclamation service; Dr. Charles W. Stiles of the Marine hospital corps, and E. W. Al len, executive secretary. George Mc- Kerrow. superintendent of Wisconsin farm Institutes, spoke on “What Wis consin Farmers Want." Former Gov. Hoard spoke of the need of rural edu cation, declared the farmers of the na tion were woefully lacking in educa tion “Promotion of knowledge among farmers is the basic need to-day," he said. “Xo other class of men has been so neglected as the farmers of tills country have been as to their intellec tual education.” Other opinions fol low: Tim country school —their educa tional center —receives less attention from them than the workmen of the eities give to their school. In one sense the teachers are responsible for what is taught. They establish what is called “knowledge." The state and community pay less toward education of the farmer than for education of any other class of people. Expect Special Message. President Charles Van Hise of the university returned from Washington, H. C.. where he went to attend the meeting of the national conservation congress. He said that it was sup posed that the commission’s report which has been presented to Presi dent Roosevelt would be transmitted with a special message to congress, “People throughout the country are aroused us never before in the ques tion of the conservation of the soil, water, forests and minerals," said President Van Hise, “and every gov ernor who was present spoke en thusiastically about the work.” The governor received from Wash ington tho patent of 19,137 acres of federal government land in northern Wisconsin which was by act of con gress turned over to Wisconsin to he added to its state forest reserve. The land lies in Ashland. Bayfield, Burnett, Douglas, Forest, Iron, Langlade. Lin coln, Marinette, Oneida, Polk, Price, Sawyer. Vilas and Washburn counties, $35,000 for Forestry. At a meeting of the Wisconsin State Forestry commission it was decided to urge the governor to ask the legisla ture to increase the annual appropria tion for the commission from $9,800 to $35,000. The request will be presented to the g< vernor by a committee cen sisting of Dean E. A Blrge of the state university and State Forester E. M.

The lake state forestry convention, representing Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota, adopted resolutions out lining a plan for the preservation of timber and the prevention of destruc tive forest fires. The resolutions rep resent the result of the two-day meet ing of the conference, w hich lias been held in the state capitol and which finished its work. These resolutions in part are as follows: "That all persons cutting and ex ploiting timber in any part of the lake states here represented should tie obliged to dispose of the debris in such manner that it shall not be a menace to the forests; that failure to do this should be punished by a fine commensurate with and consequent to the possibility of the damage. "That we advocate the patrol sys tem its the only satisfactory method of preventing forest fires and the com manding factor in fighting them. "That we recommend tlie retention of the local fire warden system with the county as the unit instead of the town, as being essential in securing interest and responsibility among the people most affected. "That it Is the sense of this meet ing that the harvest timber tax should be based on a stumpage value deter mined by the value of the forest prod ucts at the place where it is assessed, less the cost of placing it there. "That the expense of the local fire warden service and the help called out for the suppression of fires should be born wholly or in part by the coun ty or town, but the payment should first be made by the state to insure promptness. “That the successful prosecution and a commensurate punishment in case of conviction cannot often be secured in the locality where the of f'-nse lias been committed, and in ol der that the law- shall be enforced and In the interest of justice and under authority of the attorney general, a change of venue should be permitted " Solons Take Middle Road. Said a slate solon: “As the time for the session of the legislature ap proaches, it becomes more and more apparent that probably one-half of the members of the assembly will not be tied up to either the administration or radical wing of the Republican party. At present they are inclined to take tite middle road. Where they will eventually land is a question that is giving the leaders on both sides some anxious moments. ‘The plans of the radicals seem to have suffered more from this disin clination of members to join either side than have those of the administra tion forces. The former lutd been counting on support from members who are now found to be hitting on the top rail nf the fence, with no indication of getitng down. "A little time ago the radical ele mem were assuring everyone that they were certain of having a majority of the assembly. The latest revised esti mates give 2s certain radicals among the members, with the hope that this can be increased to perhaps 35 at least." Rate Law Is Violated.
