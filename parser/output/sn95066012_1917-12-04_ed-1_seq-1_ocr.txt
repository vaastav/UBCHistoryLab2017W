MUST SERVE ALL ALIKE Ruling Virtually Makes Coal a Cash Commodity With No Concea sloina to Anyone. The local members of the state fuel committee and the local coal dealers have received instructions from the state fuel administrator, H. J. II. Jones, that virtually makes coal a cash commodity. For the present a price of $9 a ton for stove and chestnut coal is fixed and a price of $8.75 for egg and grate. The radical feature of the instruc tions is that which removes the dis count. Coal must be sold for one price to every one and there is to be no cash discount for payment within 30 days as has heretofore been tho case In Bennington. The prices of $9 and $8.75 are only temporary, to prevail only so long as the present condition of the whole sale market remains as it is today. Local dealers are of the opinion that wholesale prices will advance and that the retail figures will have to be increased accordingly. The ruling leaves no option for the local dealers. It must be followed without deviation and no conces sions. TO 

CLOSE SCHOOLS January and February Vacations Recommended by Administrator. In order to conserve fuel, both for heating and lighting purposes, a new regulation which it passed by the National Fuel Administration bureau will close every school, public , and "Vaioclilal," ccllege and university in the northern and central states dur ing the months of January and Feb tuary, is being considered. A tremendous saving in coal, wood and other fuel would be realized through such a discontinuance of school sessions and the terms of schools could be so arranged that a minimum of interference with the normal school progress would result. This would be accomplished, it is explained, by continuing school ses sions one month later In the spring and commencing one month earlier in the fall. Tho plan approximates a proposal for a longer winter vacation and a correspondingly shorter one in tho summer. Besides the fuel conservation ad vantagps of the proposed change fu school terms, it is pointed out that it would permit an expansion of school garden activities, it would also dis courage summer travel on the rail roads and would relieve considerable non-essential traffic in that line and assist greatly in relieving the car shortage and general delay in tho railroading of food, fuel and ammuni tion. While this proposal has not yet been accepted by the fuel administra tion, it is strongly urged from all sides and the final decision on the matter will be given out shortly.
