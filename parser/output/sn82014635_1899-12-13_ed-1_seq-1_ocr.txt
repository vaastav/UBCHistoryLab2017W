Took rund some miles and consequently we were marching from 9:30 p. m. till 4 a, m. and were landed in an impossible possition. I do not consider the error intentional. The Boers commenced firing from the top of an unscalable height and wounded a good many of our men while In the open plain. The Second Northumberlands tried to, turn out the enemy but failed. The Sec and Irish Fusiliers seized a kepje near. But I regret to say that one gun, which should have supported them, was over turned in a deep mullah and another sank in quicksand. Neither could be ex tricated in the time available. Seeing the situation I sent a dispatch to Moltine with the news. I collected and withdrew our force from ridge to ridge for about nine miles. The Boer guns were remar kably wfll served. They carried accu rately 5,000 yards. I am holding Bush man's Hook aqd Cypbergat.

EARTHQUAKE AND TIDAL WAVE Details of the Tragedy atCeram Have Conic to Hand. San Francisoo, Dec 12. The Bulletin says: "Tho disaster Chat overtook the island of Coram on the 2d of last month, cost the poople of that district immense loss In lives and property. Tho steam ship America Maru, which arrived yes terday 'from the Orient, brought advices from Oeram and reports that 5,000 people were destroyed on that island alone when the dreadful earthquake of November shocked tho Japanese coast and agitated the lands adjacent to the empire. On tho night of the 2d, the people of Cenam were awakened by a terrific shock of earthquake that seemed to work from north to south. Everyone fled from thcif houses and took up i places in the public square. A few hours later it was report ed that the water wus rising in the bay of Ambonia. The sea came forward In the-shane of a huge tidal wave and forced the water into the twiy entrance. It came up fifty feet over the lowlands. At Pau holy and Samasoerno, on the bay, the wave swept over the. tops of trees thirty feet high. Out of nearly eighteen hun dred inhabitants only forty 'escaped. The whole const for miles was transformed into a huge mud-puddle. Corpses were everywhere. Broken trees and portions of houses were burled in the ooze. Every few rods were great lumps of stones and boulders that had been' washed up from tho sea, changing the entire topography of the country. The exact number killed along the coast will never be known, as the corpses are in many cases yards under the new ground. At Hatoesla, out of 506 people, 100 were killed and forty wound ed. The balance escaped to the hill where the shock of earthquake was first felt. SANTIAGO MORPHY IS SENT UP Embezzler in 3Iexi.cn and Ldhj :i Fu gitive inTiii Country. City of Mexico. Dec. 12.

Place on the National Repub lican .Ticket ofl 900 MAY BE GIVEN TO ROOT IVlcKinLey by Acclamation Place of the Convention. Cleveland, O., Dec. 12. A Washington dispatch to the Leader says: Washington just now is a hive of political induttry. The Arlington hotel is one of the leading centers of political activity and one can not enter the lobby of that hostelry of an evening without seeing in one corner or another small groups of prominent fig ures in tho Republican party engaged in serious and earnest consultation. Con ferences are held also in the apartments of Senator Hanna and Henry C. Payne, respectively the chairman and vice chairman of the national committee, who are guests of tho hotel. Senator Piatt of New York, Senator Spooner of Wisconsin, Senator Scott of West Vir ginia, Senator Piatt of Connecticut, who live there, with other well known mem bers of the senate, nightly throng- tho lobby. Knots of these men aro always visible, and politics is the magnet which 'brings them together. Two of the greatest questions that are receiving the attention of these men are: First Who shall bo McKinley's run ning mate next year? Second Shall we nominate our ticket toy acclamation? In tho light of information that has been gathered within the last three days from contact with leaders In politics, it may be stated almost without quoJifioa itlon that the Republican national ticket nest year will be MoKinley and Root. That the president will be renominated (there has been no doubt for a long time. As to the nominee for vice president, the sentiment In favor of Elihu Root, the secretary of war, which became appar ent several months ago, has assumed proportions which, in the opinion of men who are masters in ifche art of politics, practically insures his being given second place on the ticket. Careful, conserva tive men such as Mr. Payne is known to Ibo do not bestitate at this time to pre dict Mr. Root's nomination for the vice presidency by th eRepublican party next year. "If I were prophesying on the ticket I would say it will be MoKinley and Root," said Mr. Payne this evening. Although I am a western man, I can see reasons which admit of no argument, for ithe vice-presidential nomination going to an eastern man. It seems to be conced ed generally that Nerw York ought to pro duce nlm. Mr. Root would give the strength, firmness and prestige to the 'ticket which another man would not do, and which are needed. Ho has made a splendid record for himself as the head of the war department and is in every way fitted for tho place which Mr. Ho bart graced." That Mr. Root is willing to go on the ticket with Mr. MoKinley there is not tho slightest doubt. It may be said even that the secretary is ambitious to pro cure the vice presidential nomination. When Mr. Plntt was asked tonight whom he favored for the vice-prelden-tlnn nomination, he said: "Any good New York man would suit me." "How about Mr. Root?" "Mr. Root would be satisfactory," was Mr. Piatt's reply. "McKInley will be nominated 'by acclamation." As to the matter of nominating the en tiro ticket by acclamation there Is rea son to believe that the next Republican convention will establish such a prece dent. Senator Hanna has conceived the idea and it is remarkable how favor ably it is being received. Tho senator has confided his proposition to a few friends and they are tntliusiastic over It. Mr. Hanna believes that inasmuch as McKInley will be renominated in that manner, his running mate should be ac corded 'the same distinction. "It seems to me," he said tonight, "tliret a contest in the convention! for the vico presiden cy should be avoided, for the reason, chiefly, that President McKInley will be named for first place without opposition. The nomination for second place under the circumstances showki Ibe made, in my opinion, with the same absence of friction and con-test. If we could go be fore the country with a ticket chosen in such a way, the effect upon the party throughout the United States, and upon the people of all parties, would be most marked." Vioe-Charfrnran Payne heartily agrees with Mr. Hanna's plan. The more ne considers it ihe more pleased he becomes with it. The more he considers it the more pleased toe becomes with it. He said tonight thas he would be happy to see tho convention adopt it and that he believed that it would do so. In all pnotoattlity the Republican con vention will be held the second week In June. Mr. Payne said this evening that it would aseembie very Hkely on the ISth of that month, which would be on Tues day. This date, he believes, will be fixed by the national comnriaee at its meet ing on Friday of this week. The commit tee will &o in session two days, and among other matters that will be deter mined on "the first day is the place of holding; ihe convention next year. It 'seems to tee agreed that the jrreat Re publican gathering: win go to Chicago or Philadelphia. The latter city ts hard after it. and today a large delegation of Quaker City boomers arrived in Wash ington, established headquarter at the Arilncton and began the wort of cap turing committeemen. A delegation is now enroute to tfcci eky from Chicaa-o on a similar mission. Philadelphia has thus far shown more eabttsteani over e curintr the convention than" has Chicago, and has announced fcai $l,(y would be plodped for its entertainment. New York is also after H. as is St. Looks but as lcdctd before, it is believed that the choice of th oemmftsee will be either Ch cacn r Philadelphia. W2li!iet -n. Dec li The c eft owr the piace for holdns the next Republican convention was begun at the White House today. A large delegation from Philadelphia saw the president and ex plained to him the hopes of th4t city, but the president said it would be mani festly improper for him to express the slightest preference for any city in a contest of this character.

THOSE PHILIPPINES HEMP PORTS What Otis Says About Them and About Opening There. Washington, Dec. 12. In answer to the inquiry from the war department rela tive to the opening of the hemp ports In the Philippines, General Otis today made the following response: "Hemp ports will be open as soon as the transportation for the troops can be secured. Probably active trade in June. See annual report, page 262." A, reference to the place in the report indicated by General Otis shows the fol lowing statement: "Of the three staple articles of the island, hemp, tobacco and sugar, only the latter shows a very marked depreciation in amount secured and exported. About the same quantity of hemp was taken from the shipping ports during the past as the preceding year and large exports of tobacco have been made. There still remain in the islands considerable quantities of both hemp and tobacco, but a short time ago Aguinaldo issued a so-called decree mest injurious to his interests, forbidding his Tagalo guards to permit at the ports where they were stationed the entrance of any merchant vessel flying the Amer ican flag and as the inter-island, com merce Is carried on under that flag, his dcree terminated trade at the points where troops are now maintained."
