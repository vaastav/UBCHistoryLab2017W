Washington Further reports from Vice Admrial Sims today began to unfold the story of the torpedoing of the de stroyer Jacob Jones, but did not lessen the toll of lives lost with the ship. Only 44 of J 01 or more officers and men are known to have survived, including one unidentified man picked up and carried off by the submarine that struck the blow. Today's re ports added to the list of dead Ensign Staunton F. Falk, of 4'inaha, Neb., a young officer, who died of exposure. Washington, Dec. 9. Lieutenant Commander David -Worth Bagley and Lieutenant Norman Scott were among the survivors rescued after the sinking of the American destroyer Jacob Jones, by a German submarine in the war zone Thursday night. The Navy department was so advised late tonight by4 Vice Admiral Sims. Admiral Sims' reports said that Commander Bagley and the five men saved with him got away in a motor boat and were picked up and landed uninjured at the Scilly islands. CIVTV.PTftHT MP.N MTSSTNO 0 These two officers, two warrant of ficers and two enlisted men were named in the admiral's dispatch as survivors in addition to the 37 previ ously reported saved. Wit is now established that the other four survivors reported, be sides Commander Bagley and Lieu tenant Scott were: Chief Boatswains Mate Clarence McBride, Syracuse, N. Y. Coxswain Ben Nunnery, Edgmoor, s. c. '.. , Chief .Electrician Lawrence G.J Kel- ley, address not given. U Supplied With Rafts. ' Th4 survivors of the Jones un-.., doubtedly owe their lives to the iott thought -of the Navy department mii having provided every destroyer sent abroad with a complement of life rafts sufficient for the entire crew. They are lashed on deck in such fash ion that they release themselves and cotne to the surface if the ship sinks. Destroyers cannot carry enough life boats for their complement without a'tlirsking the lire of their guns and tor- ff jbdo tubes. ' Apparently the Jones went down almost at once. . This was taken to mean that the torpedo had scored a fair hit amidships, possibly tearing the swift craft in two" when it exploded. If this is true there can be no ques tion that many of th.e crew died in the blast of the explosion or were car ried down with the shattered hull without a chance to escape. Officers here felt that such a fate was prefer able to hours of exposure- and final death from cold on life rafts. Navy officers and officials took pride in the fact thatj the Jacob Jones and its crew had written new honors into navy records before the vessel fell victim to an enemy torpedo. l Electrician Confesses - . He Started $200,000 Fire Chicago, Dec. 9. Federal authori ties announced last night than an electrician working in the" Jnited States general medical warehouse, which was destroyed by fire with a loss of $200,000 today, has confessed that he started the fire by 'accidental ly overturning a blow torch in a pile of shavings. Officials, who at first were inclined to believe the fire was due " to in cendiarism, said the confession elimi nated all chances of a German plot.

"All that had been pictured and written of the fleeing Belgian refugees flashed across my mind as I, witnessed the stampede," he said.

Italian Headquarters in Northern Italy, Saturday, Dec. 8, 6 P. M. The battle of Asiago is virtually suspended, with the enemy checked, if not defeated, in his main design of breaking through to the Brenta valley and the plain a few miles below, although he succeeded in advancing his lines a short distance when the Italians fell bask to new positions. These positions, guarding the Frenzela and Gadena passes, have successfully resisted all enemy efforts, and the Italians oh the steep heights on each side of the passes rain down artillery and rifle fire and release huge boulders every time the enemy forces try to get through. This has continued until the Italians seem reasonably as sured of holding the passes and compelling the enemy to look for another line bf approach.

'Reds9 Demand Allies State Full War Aims London, Dec' 9. The supreme moment of the Russian crisis has arrived. It is said that one effect of President Wilson's epochal message to congress has been to cause a suspension of the mad ar mistice scheme. In connection with this the Bolsheviki have sent an ultimatum to the allies demand ing that they restate their war aims. ' In connection with the seven-day armistice declared on the Russo German front, Leon Trotsky, in the official communication received at London, says: "The period of delay thus given, even in the existing disturbed con dition of international communi cations, is amply sufficient to af ford the allied governments oppor tunity to define their attitude toward the peace negotiations; that is, their willingness or refusal to participate in negotiations for an" armistice and peace. "In case of refusal they must de clare clearly and definitely be fore all mankind the aims for which the peoples of Europe may be called to shed their blood during the. fourth year of the war." There are rumors o internal de velopments of great importance. One is. to the effect that former Emperor Nicholas has succeeded in effecting his e:ape. Little has developed as to what action the moderate forces of the nation may be contemplating in combating the Bolsheviki measures, one of which is reported to be the impending re pudiation 'of all of Russia's foreign loans. - ?
