' With the return to nor mal conditions this, unrest will rapid ly disappear" j UV; W ! ,: W The President renewed his recom mendations for legislation, to "deal ef fectively with "'those persons who by violent methods would abrogate oun time tested institutions. , '. ( ' .Several recommendations, some re newals of previous ones, were made by the President t6 bring down the cost of living. Among them were ex tension iot the food control law to peace' times for the emergency; regu lations for transportation of foods ,in interstate commerce; a cold storage law modeled after.the law in New Jersey; a law requiring marks to show the length of time foods are kept in storage and a law to secure "competitive selling and prevent un conscionable profits" by federal li cense of corporations' selling food in interstate commerce. A long portion of the message was devoted to a discussion of the condi tion and rights of labor. "A definite program to bring abput aij improve ment in the conditions of. labor and bring about a genuine democratiza tion of industry'" was recommended. "The only way to keep men frons- agitating against grievances is to re move their grievances," said the Pres ident's message. At another point it declared "the seed of revolution is repression." "The establishment of the princi ples regarding labor, laid down in the covenant of the League of Nations," said the.messags, "offers .us the way to industrial peace and conciliation. No other road lies open to us. Governments, must : recognize the right of men to bargain collectively for humane objects. ) Labor no longer must be treated as a com modity. - "The right of individuals to strike is inviolate," continued the message, "and ousht not to be interfered with by any process of govfirnmfnt; there is a predominant right, and that is the right of the government to pro tect, all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the chal lenge of any class." The President was referring to the government's recent" . injunction against the coal strike. . The message closed with a pointed reference to radicalism and ' "Red" doctrines, and referred to "Russia to day with its blood and terror" as a "painful object lesson of the power of minorities." . "There are those in this cdunWy. 

"PRICES UP IP MINERS WIN" said the message, "who -threaten -ok; rect action to force their will upori a majority. It makes Jittle difference what rnihority it is, whethi r caoital or labor, or any other class,! no sort of privilege will ever be per-;! mitted to dominate this country. . ; Orderly processes, the message, said, were the only Ones by which re lief 'and reform could be obtained; s ) "Those who would propose any other method of reform are enemies of this country," the message , said. u.j Let those beware who take the shorter road of disorder -and, revolution." . , MISSOURI TROOPS TO COAt ... FIELDS ' , Gov. Gardner Orders Detachment of National Guard to carton County. Jefferson City, Dec. a.-'Governor Gardner tonight ordered a detach ment of troops fjrom the 7th regiment of national guard at Kansas City to oroceed to barton county, this state; and preserve order The troops will Living Costs Higher for Three Years it Public Yields, Palmer Says. Washington. -Dec. i. A. Milchc Palmer, attorney general called upon the American people, tonight to "re fuse, to be stampededby. 1 threats 01 lack of coal into concussions which will insure, unreasonably high prices in all commodities for at least three years to come." A statement of the government's attitude .was made by the attorney general in' a telegram to the chamber of commerce at Moberly, Mo., from which had coine a request that anoth er conference of operators and min ers be called. ; Mr. Palmer opposed further confer ences, saying the wage increase pro posed by Dr. Garfield equalized the average miner's wages with the pres ent high cost of living, without in creasing the price of coal. "The cost of living now is at the high point," Mr. Palmer said. "To grant the demands of the miner.-, would make the. cost of living still higher. The new wage conference pie to increase this production in the near future to a-point which will sup ply the demand, if economy and con servation in industry are employed. "Any other plan to reopen nego- uJ-tiations for a new wage scale between the miners and operators would be futile and would delay rather than ad vance production. So long as the leaders of the miners' organizations believe their . unlawful strike will force the public into a condition of suffering and loss, which will com pel further, increases of wages, con tiirmhl conferences on the subject will result only in influencing miners not to return to work. "The situation calls for the stead fast support by the public pf the gov ernment's position, as announced by Dr. Garfield." leave Kansas City at : midnight andS-would run three winters and there- should reach Barton county at o'clock tomorrow morning. Only a part of the regiment will be called out unless other exigencies arisev- v. The troops will be under command of Capt. Roger Davis', brother of Maj. Murray Davis of Kansas City; who lost" his life in the Battle of the Ar gonne. Adjutant General Clark said he would not go to Barton county before tomorrow, and possibly not at all. Both Governor Gardner and. the adjutant general are exceedingly reti cent about the necessity of troops be ing sent to Barton county, save that the destination of the troops will be very close o the coal fields in the Pittsburg (Kas.) district, where troops are now quartered to protect yp1i)fUppr miners npiintinff the atriu pits. . Even blase Broadway blinked when news leaked out that little Johnny Coakley had "cleaned" one of ' the swiftest crap games in town to the lilting tune of $75,000. Coakley, a quiet little fellow, 28 years old and well dressed, is said to have shown a select coterie of playmates a lot of tricks wTth the Mississippi marbles that they never heard of before. The game occurred in an uptown hotel room. 1 ., fore would maintai'n a higher cost of living for substantially three years. Such a situation cannot be tolerated. "In addition to this, Dr. Garfield suggested a 'consultative body to in vestigate more-completely the whole situation, to be composed of repre sentatives equal in number to the miners and operators, and to be pre sided over by the secretary of the in terior. Such a body would investi gate, among other tilings, the prof its of the operators. If these should be found to be unreasonably high, the public should receive the benefit in a decreased price of coal, after the miners have had their wages finally adjusted on a fair basis. I under stand this plan is acceptable to the 11 the iiimeis leliiiii lu uuerators. 11 the miners work- and agree to this plan, a way would be immediately open for per manent settlement. "In the meantime, however, the op erators have posted the advance in wages proposed by Dr. Garfield so working miners will immediately re ceive the benefit of this increase. The production of coal now closely approximates 50. per cent of normal and I have confidence that a suffi cient number of miners will comply with the wishes of- their government and respond to the needs of the peo- Directors Elected.
