We have official information that East Tennessee is, at length, delivered from the rebel reign of terror.

The President has issued a Proclamation, calling upon the people to assemble in their places of worship, to thank Almighty God for this special and signal deliverance. Let the people respond. Let us urge the clergymen and loyal people of Portage Coun ty to give cordial and prompt heed to this re quest of our good President. Crowd all of the sanctuaries. The ITI terious Army. The King of France with forty thoosand men, Marched np the hill, and then marched down again. After all the flourish of trumpets, all the reports of dashing movements, and of having " outwitted Lee,' Gen. Meade has returned, and closed the campaign for the present sea sou, having lost over six hundred men, and gained, positively nothing. The Army of the. Potomac is a splendid army, but poorly handled, and worse led. It is good as a police regulation for Washington, but as an efficient and successful battle-army, its history is singularly barren. It will now go into winter quarters, and Meade's head will fall, into the basket and his successor will probably carry his bead on his shoulders until some time next Spring. Th Escape ot John Morgan, Bead the State Journal's account of this even'. un the first page. It is the most dis graceful and humiliating event of the war. A base lack of vigilance on the part of the Warden and bis guards, and such military of ficers as may have had a responsibility in the matter, may be safely charged, but it may al so be said in addition, that treachery and cor ruption, inside and out of the walls, had so efficient agency in the work. It is to be hoped a full investigation will be made, and if the facts can be ascertained, let the crush ing blow fall on the delinquent or delinquents. The Columbus -Statesman says, the milita ry surrounded the State House, and that that building was thoroughly searched tb find John Morgan. Who, about the Capitol, is suspect ed of complicity with the escape? That there has been knavery of the darkest hue, if the facts ever come to light, will be fully shown. Two of Morgan's associates in the escape are reported to have been captured in Ken tucky. The report that Morgan had reached Toronto isialso 3aid to be false. That was put forth as a blind, to aid Morgan in his es cape. He was, doubtless, and may be yet, secreted in Columbus; or he may be, by this time, in Dixie. Thanh itlTini Proclamation by the President. Executive Mansion,) Washington, December 7, Reliable information, having been received that the insurgent force is retreating from East Tennessee, rendering it probable thatthe Union forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important position, and esteeming this to ha 'of high national consequence, I recommend that all loyal people do', on re ceipt of this information, assemble at their places of worship and render espeeial homage and gratitude to Almighty God for this great advancement of the national cause.

LINCOLN. Foreljpa Reoatsrnition, and How to Prevent it. In the present posture of affairs, the gen eral impression is that there is no longer to be indulged any apprehension of Foreign re cognition. This feeling is streagthened by the temper recently manifested by the Gov ernments of England and France in the de tention ot the rebel rams. Notwithstanding this, the 'destruction of the Great Republic is as ranch desired as ever by Monarchial Eu rope, and any plausible pretext for recognition would even yet be seized upon. The Lon don Post says " that any serious reverse just now to the Federal arms would leave neu trals no alternative but to recognise the South." On this topic of decisive recogni tion on the part of European Governments, the New York Independent; of Nov. 26tb, properly suggests an important line of Con gressional legislation. . It says: "Now our business is, not to take, it for granted that recognition and intervention are impossible, but to act in such a way as to make them so. And how is this to be done? One way is to beat the rebels in the field and by the sea-side. To defeat Bragg and Lee, to take Charleston, Wilmington, Savannah, Mobile and Richmond, would settle the ques tion effectually. But we have it in our pow er to distttfboiut the hopes of the secession ists on btith sides the ocean, even if none of these things should be done even if the 'se rious revses' hoped for by the Post should overtake us. And that is by putting our selves,' nation, in a position to demand of the Powers of Europe to refuse to recognize any now power which declares its object of separate exister.ee to be the porpetuation and extension of s'.avery. As it is, we stand, motally and diplomatically, at a disadvantage on thjs matter as Ion;; as we recognize and maintain slavery by law within the limits of our own jurisdiction. It gives our enemies abroad an occasion of branding us with incon sistency and hypocrisy when we ask them, to take a "higher stand as to slavery thari the one we occupy ourselves., We are aware that this ground is not capable of a logical defense, but it is too plausible not to have great weight on Dublic obinion. "Now" it is within the legal capacity of Congross to take away forever the reproach of tbe Proclamation that it abol ish sfivrV where it could not reach it, and left it alone where-it-MiV Let-Congress at the ODeninz of its approaching session. enact, as a war measure essential to the reduction of the rebels and tne preservaiioTi oi me union, that slavery shall cease, on and' after the 1st of January next, Bvr.rjrwnetv wwa me lim it of tbe United Swtes, with e very alle vi- tion of compensation to loyal members that can be devised, rjncu a tv, penis uu com plement of tlwr Proclamation, would raise the United States far abova any possibility of any European interference againt them.

Acapulco, Mexico, Nov. 10th, 1863 Editor Democrat: I am in receipt of the election returns of Ohio, through the medium of the Democrat. No wonder your rejoicings are abundant and language latno in giving utterances to the rap turous emotion of loyal hearts at such a glo rious victory. But my astonishment reaches a climax when I reflect that so many Copper heads are found in Old Portage, voting for an arch Traitor, that a noble and loyal General had sent beyond our lines for a crime, and that, the darkest and most cruel, known to Law. I cannot account for so many voting the "trai tor's tieket" in Old Deerfield only on the ground that they belong to that class of vo ters who are still voting for General Jackson those who are laboring under the misappre hension that the Democratic party is yet alive, and giving law to the nation. Is there no society organised with funds sufficient to sustain a political Missionary "in the field of the land and shadow of death ?" But the loyal pyramid as it looms up in towering grandeur must be very gratifying to our patriotic President, who has borne the burden of the civil department of the Gov ernment, which heretofore absorbed all the powers of former Presidents to conduct " ac cording te law," at the same time conducting a campaign against the great rebellitm that en gages the attention of the world. It is a source of satisfaction to know that the people themselves, set a high value upon the Union that they are determined that the rebellion shall not overthrow the government, or di vide a free nation in order to establish op pression under the form of law.. I hope that at the next Presidential election Portage Coituty will roll up a majority for the Union ticket of 2000 at least. Do not aim lower than that. While our soldiers in front are ad monished to aim low, those at home must aim high, because they fight with bullets, and you with ballots. E. tetters from Subscriber.. Hopkins, Allegan Co.,) Michigan, Nov. 26th, 1863. , Editor Democrat : . Dear Sib : Enclosed please find $3,00 in payment for arrearages on the Democrat, and one year in advance, for which please send re ceipt. We can haidly bear to part company with the Democrat, yet we are not weaned from the many pleasant associations of other days. Al though engrossed by the cares of business, and surrounded by new friends and associa tions, we spend an hour pleasantly each week in the perusal of the Democrat which comes freighted with local items, personal and polit ical, jremindiBg ns of many kind friends of other days. We Ohioans felt like shouting, on account ef the news of, your -election. That yon had elected the arch traitor to still " watch and wait," over the border, was glory enough for one day. Now; once more "fill up the ranks" and drive the last vestige of rebellion into the gulf. Then right about face, and drive copperheadism into the bor der, and then for humanity and universal freedom for all. Our faith is strong in a Prov idence that never errey amtswo Cam - abide the result in patience; although " Uncle Abe," sometimes seems slow for this fast age. , j S i.

John Estv, died at Mantua, Nov. 15, 1863, of Palsy, aged 71 years. He was born at Phelpstown, Onrio Co., New York, 1793. Moved to Mantua, Por tage County, in 1818, where he has resided for the last 45 years. He was ever an affec tionate father, a kind husband, and an exem plary and useful citizen. He received a com mission as 1st Lieut, in 1825, from Gov. Mor row, and was commissioned Captain in the 1st Rifle Regiment in 1830, by Gov. Trimble. How faithful he performed his part will be re membered by those familiar with the military affairs in Portage County, in those early days. Asa temporary volunteer he had seen some service in the war of 1812, and fully appre ciated the importance of military discipline. The" same patriotic feelings actuated him to the hour of his death. He was a firm Dem ocrat in early times, when democracy battled for equality, and opposed monopolies. When democracy was prostituted to the vile purpose of extending human slavery, he was a reliable Republican. From the commencement of the present war he was a firm Union man. No one sympathized more with our soldiers than he, or expressed more abhorrence for treason whether open or covert. With pecu liar satisfaction he cast his last vote for Brough, saying that he was voting for his country, for posterity and not for himself. His memory will be fondiy ci.erished by those who knew him best. - .' Communicated. To the Temperance ."fieri and Women or Ohio. Is not the present a proper season to revive labor in this cause ?
