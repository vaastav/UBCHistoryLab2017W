J^urleigh county is traceable to the (Missouri river water supply, which is used., almost entirely in Bismarck. a11 the cases of typhoid Teftotdd "are those brought in from otheB.points for treatment in the two t^So^^k ^spitals. *ta*® is woefl,11' ielin- iuerrtin,tbeiftatter of vital statistics. IV .appears now as though Fargo, Bis artarck and* Grand Forks would soon enter the Registration Area and give the vital statistics of these places a proper status with the federal author­ ities. lElsmarck can be proud of her low death rate. It i3 the healthiest city of its size in the state, and will crowd the records of many of the same size in older states, where sanitary reg­ ulations have been brought to a high er degree of perfection.

President Wilson's message is an emphatic and frank admission of the failure of the Democratic party prop erly to finance the federal govern­ ment. This condition he now seexs to rectify by imposing new and heavy (burdens of internal taxation upon the people of the United States. Halting for some time 'between three mediums of raising revenue: Ifond issue, increase in tariff schee ules and internal revenue, the chief executive seemingly haa taken the path of least resistance and shifted the burden directly to an already overtaxed public. He dismisses the entire subject as follows: "In a country of great industries like this, it ought to be eajiy jist tribute the burdens of taxation with­ out making them anywhfe^e'.b^ir too heavily or too exclusively upon one set of persons or undertakings. What is dear is, that the industry of this generation should pay the bills." 'No one should know better than President Wilson that one of the hardest tasks is the even distribution of taxation. 'It is also a matter of comment that the whiskey and tobac­ co interests, largely southern indus­ tries, will not participate in the pro­ posed increase of internal taxation. Surely the message is a gloomy one to preface a great national political campaign. The administration is in financial straits. With an empty treasury, it proposes estimates for public expenditures exceeding those of any congress during a period of peace. This section of the message reads as though the nation were at war and that its very defense demanded more revenue: "And there are many additional sources of revenue which can justly fne resorted to without hampering the industries of the country or putting any too great, charge upon individual expenditure. A one per cent tax per gallon on gasoline and naptha would yield, at the present estimated pro­ duction, $10,000 (KM) a tax of fifty cfeAts per horse power on automobiles and internal explosion engines, $15, 000,000 a stamp tax on bank checks, probably $1i8,000,000 a tax of twenty five cents per ton on pig iron, $10, 000,000 a tax of fifty cents per ton on fabricated iron and steel, prdb ably *10,000,000. There is a post-mortem significance to President Wilson's insistence of a government merchant marine, after the death .blow he gave the American shipping industry in signing the no­ torious LaFollette seamen's (bill. By that act alone, he drove more vessels from American registry than he can ever hope to restore by the recommendations of this message. Between the lines of this message, the first of a series to precede the great political battle of 1916, can be read the ignominious failure of the Wilson administration to solve the great governmental and economic questions of the day. While most people will agree that this nation should take steps for na­ tional defense, President Wilson's recommendations seem impossible of achievement at this sessron of Con­ gress.

WISE PRECAUTION. Framers of the constitution of this and several other states took a wise step when, they limited the appointive power, of the governor by making all members? :of the legislature ineligible to appointive positions during the term for which they wet^electe'dl It is merely subterfuge $nd. evasion for a member to resign. That doe3 not lift the constitutional (ban. A special session in Illinois recent­ ly attempted to create several easy births for members of the legisla­ ture in a certain bill. The act *as promptly and properly vetoed by Gov­ ernor Dunne. There is no reason Vhy legislatures or governors should overtiaS-^he^Sfc pressed mandates of the constitution! Comm^iBft .on Gov. Dunne's veto the Chicago Tribune well says: "The legislature has a tough time of it trying to convert ie constitu­ tion into a tolerant document {between friends, but no one can say that it fails from lack of trying. If the straight road were electrically lighted the assembly would taXe a dark lan­ tern and start out obliquely into the brambles." PREPAREDNESS, PAN-AM ERICANISM AND REVENUE (Continued from page one) western hemisphere to prevent col lective economic ruin. Mexican Situation. The president pointed to the atti­ tude of the United StateB towards 'Mexico as proving that this country has no selfish motives in its interest in countries in Central and South America. There was a time, he said, when the United States looked upon itself as a sort of guardian of the re­ publics to the south as against the encroachment or efforts of political control from Europe. 'Butt," he added, "it was always dif­ ficult to maintain such a role without offence to the pride of the peoples whose freedom of action we sought to protect, and every thoughtful man of affairs must welcome the altered circumstances of the new day in whose light we now stand, when there is no claim of guardianship or thought of wards, but, instead, a full and hon­ orable association of partners be­ tween ourselves and our neighbors, in the interests of all America, North and South. Pan Americanism. .''Our concern for the independence fajntd the prosperity of the States of "Central and South. America is not al­ tered. We retain unabated the spirit that has inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by President (Monroe. We still mean always to make a common cause of national independence and of politi­ cal liberty in America. Put that pur­ pose is now better understood so far as it concerns ourselves. It is known not to ibe a selfish purpose. It is known to have in it no thought of taking advantage of any government in this hemisphere or playing its poli­ tical fortunes for our own benefit. All the governments of America stand, so far as we are concerned, upon a foot­ ing of genuine equality and unques­ tioned independence." "We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test," reclared the president. He added that it remained to be seen whether Mexico had been benefited Iby the course taken by the adminis­ tration, but that "we have at least proved that we will not take advant­ age of her in her distress and under- I ®5 ^'1 Utopian Scene from the William Fox special at the Bismarck Theater, tonight take to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing." Points Moral. "The moral is," continued the pres­ ident, "that the states of America are not hostile rivals but co-operating friends, and that their growing sense of community interest, alike in mat­ ters political and in matters economic is likely to give them a new signifi­ cance as factors in international af­ fairs and in the political history of the world. It presents them as in a very deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking together, quick with common sympa­ thies and common ideals. Separated, they are subject to all the cross cur­ rents of the confused politics of a "world of hostile rivalries united in spirit and purpose they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful des­ tiny. "1 am interested to fix your atten­ tion on tjiis prospect now, because un­ less you take it within your view and permit the full significance of it to command your thought I can not find the xight- lighti iii which to set forth. the particular. matter that lies at the'very front of my whole thought as I address you today. I mean na­ tional defense.'''.' i. Passion of People. 'The passion of the American peo­ ple, the president declared, was for peace that conquest and dominion was not in their reckoning nor agn able to their principles. ''But just because. we demand un­ molested development and the undis­ turbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right atod liberty," he said, "we resent, from whatever quarter .it may come, the. ag­ gression we out-selves will not prac­ tice.-^ We. insist upfifa security in pro­ secuting 4our self-ehbuen lines of na­ tional dejrelopment^We do more than that* We. demand-. tw*lso for others." Wlaiy fne ^resid#iif51Siec:ared,"was re­ garded by the United States merely as a means of asserting the rights of a people against aggression, and that "we are as fiercely jealous of coer­ cive or dictatorial power within our own nation as from aggression from without." He said the nation would not maintain a standing army except for uses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war, but that the country did ibelieve in a 'body of free citizens ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and of the government. Disciplined Might. "But war has never been a mere matter of men and arms," he continu­ ed. "It is a thing of disciplined might. If our citizens are ever to fight effec­ tively upon a sudden summons, they mu3t know how modern .fighting is done, and what to do when "the .sum­ mons comes to render themselves immediately available awriihmedlate ly effective.

The military arm of their gpvernment, whlch/they will not al­ low to direct them, they may, proper^ ly use tp.,serve them and make their independence secitre—and not their own independence merely, but the rights also of those with whom they have made' common cause, should they also be put in jeopardy." The president presented the war department plans for strengthening the army as "the essential first step" and "for the present sufficient. The plans include the increasing of the standing army to a force of 141,84:5 men of all services, and the establish­ ment of a supplementary force of 400,000 disciplined citizens, who would undergo training for short periods throughout three years of a six years' enlistment. Patriotic Feeling. "It would depend, upon the patrio­ tic feeling of the younger men of the country whether they responded to such a call to service or not," said the president. "It would depend upon the patriotic spirit of the employers of the country whether they made it possible for the ytfunger men in their $mp|oy to respond under favor­ able conditions or, not. I for one, do not- doubt th« patriotic' devotion either of our young, men or of those who give them employment—those for whose bepeflt&)<| protection 'they ^would in fact edjp,. would look

Outlining the details of the navy plan presented by Secretary Daniels, the president said that "it. involves only a shortening of the time within which plans, long matured shall be carried out hilt it does make definite and explicit a program which has heretofore been only implicit, Hold rn the minds of the committees on naval affairs and disclosed in the debates of the two houses but nowhere formulat­ ed or formaUy adopted, It seems to me"very clear that it will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a compre­ hensive plan for putting the navy up­ on a final footing of strength and efficiency and to press that plan to completion .within the next five years." Merchant Marine. The president said that in order to secure national self-efficiency and self-security the country must have a merchant marine. "For it is a quiStion of independ­ ence," he asserted. 'Tf other nations go to war or seek to hamper each other's commerce, our merchants, it seems, are at their mercy, to do with as they please.' We must use their ships, and use them as they deter­ mine. Our' independence is provin­ cial, and it is only oh land and within our own. borders. We are not likely to be permitted, to use even the ships of other,.natipas in rivalry of their own trade, and are "without means to extend our commerce even v.J'ere the doors are wide open and our goods desired. Such a situation is not to be endured. It ,is .of capital importance that the United iStates should be its own,carrier on the seas and enjoy the THE
