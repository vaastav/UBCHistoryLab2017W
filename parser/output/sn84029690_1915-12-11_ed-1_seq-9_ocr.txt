The People of Buckeye sure are - en joying the fine weather. A large number of the Buckeye peo ple attended the show in Hays last week. Hans Jensen left Sunday night for Denver.

Mer cer, Secretary of the Kansas State Live Stock Association, and the reply of Olis L. Benton, may be of interest to many of our readers who are inter ested in live stock business: Topeka, Kas., Nov. 5, 1915. Hon. Otis L. Benton Oberlin, Kas. Dear Mr. Benton: I am expecting to attend a conference of representatives of the various busi ness interests of the country at Chicago on November 15th and 16th. I have selected for my subject, "Daily fluctua tion in live stock at market centers compared with the daily fluctuation of the finished product." I have compiled a report of the mar ket at Kansas City, from May 1st to November 1st, as shown by the Drovers Daily Telegram, and in order to com plete the information I want I am writ ing to several of the large shippers of our association and asking them for a statement of their shipments during this time, showing the variations in prices they received for the cattle they shipped. I wish you would give me a letter of this kind and any information you might want to write concerning the subject. I will use your name in my statement if you have no objection, but will not do so if you would rather I would not. Please write me at your earliest con venience as I will want your letter to assist in completing the outline of the subject. Yours truly, J. H. Mercer, Sec'y. Rl Oberlin, Kas., Nov. 12, 1915. Hon. J. H. Mercer, Secretary Topeka, Kansas. My Dear Mr. Mercer: Absence has prevented my replying to your letter of the 5th inst. sooner. In March of this year, I sold 100 head of cattle on the Kansas City market for $7.20 per cwt. that lost me $20. per head. In June of this year I sold 200 head of cattle on the Kansas City mar ket, which brought me $9.30 per cwt. and made me some money. The Con sumer who bought beef for his wife and babies paid practically the same price for beef in March as he did 'in June. It is a rank injustice to the producers of this country that there should be such a variation and if it can be remedied in any way without legis lation, I would like to see it done, but I am in favor of stringent laws, and if we can find that the price of the pro ducts of the soil are being controlled unlawfully by a body of men, I am in favor of the passage of a law that will not end with a fine, but will give a jail sentence. The mere cash penalty for violation of the law is in no wise bene ficial and accomplishes little or no good to the producers. I do not wish in this letter to make the charge that the price of beef and pork is being control led by a combination of men, but from my experience in marketing live stock from this part of Kansas, I must admit that I feel very suspicious, and I am in favor of all honest and legitimate means that will give us an open and free mar ket, with competition amongst the buy ers on a legitimate and honorable basis. Yours hruly, Otis L. Benton. TH

After meat, Mr. Henry Oshant, toastmaster, followed the printed program. Repre sentative business and professional men of Hays, who are also members of the church, responded to the toasts, which seemed to unite upon the central theme of "Brotherhood." It was truly a brotherhood meeting". A Lutheran Brotherhood will be organized in the near future as a result of this Men's Fellowship Meeting. Methodist Notes. 9:45 a. m. Sunday School. 11:00 a. m.

There were two members added to the orchestra. The choir loft is now too small for both choir and orchestra. The league was led by Miss Blanche Connelly. The missionary subject was very interestingly handled by her, and those present report it most helpful to them.

Kins ley Mercury. White Slavers at Work. Rev. S. E. Betts has recently deliver ed a series of addresses or lectures in Lyons, Kas., with "The White Slave Traffic" as his subject. The Lyons News says: "The several lectures given here in the past few days by the Rev. S. E. Betts on the white slave question. ' directed to general and to special aud iences, were among the finest of the kind that have been heard by our peo ple. He handles this difficult subject in a simple and reasonable way, not : merely calling attention to the disease, j but prescribing a remedy that is in I reach of all." I In connection with this it may be of j interest to note that within Jthe past seven weeks Brother Betts nas been in thirteen towns and small cities in Kan sas and he found, he saj-s, "the tracks of white slavers in eight. They got away with five girls and only one of the five has so far been rescued. The slavers got a fine girl, eighteen years old, in Herington, Kansas; within the past six months. I have found the work of the 'kodak fiends' in three of the towns." Occidentals, Take Notice. Annual election of officers on Satur day, Dec., 4th, at 2 o'clock p. m.
