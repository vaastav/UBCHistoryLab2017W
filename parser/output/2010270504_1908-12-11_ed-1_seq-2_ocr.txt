THE STATE CAPITAL MATTERS OF INTEREST TO ALL CITIZENS. REESE AS THE CHIEF JUSTICE This Is the Title He Will Bear Until a Successor Is Chosen In the Ycr.r 1914. The Chief Justiceship. Judgo M. 11. Rcoso will boar the title of chief Justlco of the supremo court from now until a successor Is choson, who will tnko his place In 1914. This was announced the past wcok, aftor a mooting or the now nug mented court. Judge Ramos hns held the title na ranking member of tho court. Tho change was made In accordance with tho Interpretation which the Judges placed upon tho nmendment providing Tor the enlarged court. This provides ror tho election or three Judges In 1909. They will nil tho plnces mndo vacant by expiration of tho' torms of Judges Darnes, Sulllvnin and Fawcott. In 1911 thrco will bo elected to fill tho places nt tho expira tion of tho terms of Judgo Letton, Root nnd Rose. In 1913 one Judgo Is to' bo elected to fill tho plnco of Judgo Reese. Tho constitution In providing for tho elections makes tho Judgo to be elected In 1913 and ench six yoars thorenftor chlcr Justice. It also pro vldos that tho Judgo whoso term ex pires at that tlmo shall bo chlor Justice until then.' That tho Tour remaining members or tho old commission will contlnuo to servo the stato nnd draw salaries ror n tlmo yet is Indicated from tho ruct that at tho first sitting of tho court seven cases wore nsslgned to tho commission for nrgumont. The court nsslgned thirteen cases ror ar gument bororo Itself. Judge Sullivan wns not present when tho court mot nnd usslgnod enses. Ho nrrlvcd Inter nnd qualified Immediately, sitting with the court later to hear nrgumont. Rose, Root and Fawcott wore alroady In Lincoln.

C. Calkins, A. C. Epperson and E. E. Good. Tho commission will probably bo continued until after tho cases which are In the lunula or these rour members hnvo been decided. It Is not likely, howovor, thnt they will benr nny further cases after tho present nlttlng. Sullivan's Withdrawal Regretted. Genulno nnd goncrnl regret has been expressed on all sides at tho de termination of Judgo Sulllvnn to re linquish tho plnco on tho supreme bencirofferod him by Governor Shel don. At the same tlmo It Is freoly ad mitted, that Judge Sullivan could nut, In justlco to hlmseir, hnvo dono other than he did. There seems la hnvo boon n pretty general reeling, howovor, that Judge Sullivan's re-election to the bench next year, had ho cared to enter tho race, would havo boon without ques tion. A dozen prominent republicans, Including sovernl stato ofilcors, have said that t!'ey bollovcd no man In tho stato better qualified for the placo than Judgo Sulllvnn nnd thnt they would bo glad of tho opportunity to vote Tor him. There Is some criticism or Gov. Sheldon Tor not mnklng Judge Sulll vnn 0110 of tho three-year appointees. It Is possible that, had this been done, tho resignation would not hnvo been tendered.
