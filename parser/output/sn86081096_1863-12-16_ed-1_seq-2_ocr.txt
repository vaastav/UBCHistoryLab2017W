THE JOURNAL. Coudersport, l*a. • M fMlloWl&Vf Deo. 1G,1863 M. W. MCALARNEY, EDITOR. Evening Post has seen a pri ▼ite letter from a high source iu St. I'e ttraburg, which says that the reception •steaded to the Ilussian naval officers in this country is producing the most grati fjiog results iu St. Petersburg. "Go where I may," says the writer, "it is the theme of conversation —alike in the clubs, it the theatre*, in the cafes, and upon the pave." The writer adds that iu an interview with the Piinee Gortschakofi, with which he had been honored, he found that office* completely overGowirg with satisfaction at what he termed this "georgeous demonstration." Nor, to the •urprise of the writer, was Prince Gort ••hakofl ignorant of the smallest detail. | for he even related many incidents of whieh our legation is said to have known ••thing. GIN. GRANT ON SLAVERY.— Senator "Wilson, in a recent speech in Philadel phia, said : I saw the other day a letter from Gen. Grant. That Genera! savs : "I hare never boen an anti-slavery man, but I try to judge justly of what I see; I made up my mind wheu this war opened that the North and the South could only live to gether in peace as one nation by being a free nation. Slavery," said lie. "which con stituted the corner stone of the so-called confederacy, is knocked out; and it will take more men to hold the black race as •Uvts than it would to put down the re bullion; and." said he, "much as I desire to see peace, and 1 lung tor it, I am op posed to any peaee until this question of olavery is forever settled SflT'fhe President's message meets the highest praise from loyal men generally, but the copperheads of course can see 1 nothing in it to admire or approve of. — Three sentencs in it, Forney '.s liu/- Fress, j •ays should be written in letters of gold : j "Tho crifis which threatened to divide; the friend* of the Union is past." "I •hall Dot return to slavery any person who is free by the terms to the Procla nation, or by aDy act cf Congress' "I proclaim full pardon to all who solemnly swear to faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United: Sutes; and the onion of the States there-j mnder, and thenceforward keep and main lain said oath inviolate. 1 lie point that attracts most attentiou and discussion is the piaD for the reconstruction of the Ution, which is heartily approved by union men, and as heartily denounced by the disloyal. Jeff. Davis's Message to his rebel Con gress is a lengthy document, commencing with a review of the war lor the past year, and clobinsr with the sentiment that "the only hope uf peace is iu the vigor of re sistance." Passages will be found, how ever, through the Message, which betray the fact that 31 r. Davis is lather dubious as to how the means of vigorous resid ence can be raised. Ihe policy of foreign governments aud the currency question, with the mode of raising increased taxa tion, are the topics most elaborately dis cussed. On the former lie is very elo quent, but on the latter rather despond cot. He recommends largely increased taxation and fresh levies of troops. He iaforms Congress that the mines of the South and its foundries and workshops n supply them with all the munitions and materials needed for continuing the war. I©-The Secessionists at Havana — aotiug doubtless, upon private advice from Dixie—have given over the Rebel cause as past praying for. One of them, we learn who had about $400,000 of Con federate funds in his hands, lias confisca ted the whole to the. replenishment of his private exchequer, and fled therewith to parts nnknown. It was understood there that the break-up of the concern must be near at hand. new Statu of West Virginia has been divided by her Legislature into townships, like other Free States, and wnlike the Slave States, which have no *lvil division below Counties She has Do adopted a comprehensive Free School system. They say West Virginia is un oustitutiuiial ; but she don't act like it. 

OVER REACHING. —To prevent horses rvet-reaching in traveling, a writer in the Jiural jS'ew Yorker says, let the black- j smith make the "heel corks ot the lore shoes high and the toe corks low ; and the j toe corks of the hind shoes high aud the heel corks low." An iufallible remedy,, it is claimed. ONLY A PRINTER —"IJe is only A printer," was the sneering remark of a Voader in society.

Says Ilonry Ward Beecher, "T have one boy in the army, and another at home only fifteen years of age. If the war lasts till he is sixteen he will go too." That is the true spirit. give below a complete state ment of the result of the recent draft tn this Congressional District. There were 3,309 men drafted in the District, who were disposed of,or disposed of themselves as follows : Paid commutation 840 Draft" d men sent to rendezvous 299 Drafted men deserted 6 Substitutes sent to rendezvous 130 Suostitutes deserted 10 Failed to report 423 Physical disability 963 ' Mental '• 10 Only son and support of widow 97 !

Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge are two very high mountains, one S. E. and the other S. W. from Chattan ooga, while Chickamauga is still further South. The Rebels had possession of those mountains, which would have "com manded" Chattanooga—if cur man had allowed them. Both these high points were assailed by the Union forces. Oo one, a report says, "Gen. Ilooker t cas fighting above the clouds." Both posi tions had to be taken bt the Unionis be fore they could rout the Rebels from Chiekamauga, Rosaville, and the other points they held but it was done, and Bragg's force seems all near Dalton. One of these high mountain tops was carried, on the 26th ult., in a manner thus nar rated in an official report : "The storming of the ridge by our troops, was one of the greatest miracles in military history No man who climbs the ascent by any of 'lie roads that winds along its front, can believe tliat 18,000 men were moved upon its broken and crumbling face, unless it was his fortune to witness the deed. It seems as awful as a visible interposition of God. Nei ther Generals Giant aud Thomas inten ded it. Their orders were to carry the rifle pits along the base of the ridge aud cut off their occupants. But when this was accomplished, the unaccountable spirit *<f the troops bore them boldly up the impracticable steeps, over the bris tling rifle pits on the crest and the thirty cannon enfilading every gully. The or der to storm appears to have been given simultaneously by Geueruls Sheridan and Wood, because the uien were not to be held back. Hopeless as the attempt ap peared to military prudence, the generals caught the inspiration of the men, and were ready the.nielves to undertake im possibilities." THE WAY THE 

SOLDIERS VOTE.— There aria few States in the West that allow their soldiers iu the field to vote Returns are nearly complete from the camps, and the results sum up as follows : VOTES OF SOLDIERS, 1863. STATES. CN'ION, COPPER. TOTAL. Ohio 41,621 2 393 41,014 lowa 16.791 2,904 19,695 Wisconsin 8.851 622 9l7Uj Missouri 5,639 203 5,932 Total 72,902 6,212 79,114 Here is a Union Majority of 66.690 in a vote of 79.114, or more than ninety two per cent, in favor of the old flag, .and the crushing out of the rebellion. Yet "rue Democrats do all the fighting"—of course! Ye 9, and the Cospetheads want "Abo litionists" to volunteer, so as to save them from the draft. "Sec 'em hanged first !' It was professed "Democrats" who got up the War. There is not a Republican or an Abolitionist in Rebellion—not one. willingly, in the Rebel ranks. Our party have furnished three fourths of the sold iers heretofore. Now let the Democrats make up what is wanted, by volunteering* or stand the draft like men. £@"Mr. Calfax. the new Speaker in Congress, is—like his predecessors, Messrs Grow and Banks—a self made man lie is about forty years of age, a native of New York city, where he worked as a printer. In 1536, lie settled in Northern Indiana, and has published the South Bend Register from that day to this. Ten years ago lie was elected to Congress, and lias been re-elected four times. A cool debater, courteous but firm in his intercourse with others, inde fatigable as a worker, popular and fair as a public man, he is likely to prove a capital Speaker. 31 r. McPhcpson, the new Clerk, is an accomplished graduate, sometime a polit ical Editor. His character, industry and ability as a Member of the last Congress commended him for his present post. On his paternal home, near Gettysburg, com menced the three days' battle. 

HARD TO SUIT —If the President gives a true Democrat an office, the Cop perheads say he is a "greenback" man, "bought up " If he does not appoint any such, they denounce him as unfair, and as partial to the Abolitionists. If there are not enough men to protect every point on the thou>ands of miles of war. the President is denounced for his inefficiency. If he calls for volunteers, these Cops, won't enlist —they denounce drafting—and they try every way to pre vent men going to swell the armies. The Cops object to our soldiers voting, because they vote to put down the Rebels bv arms. They say nothing against th§ Rebel soldiers voting, aod in some cases the Rebel soldiers vote to submit to the rightful authorities of Uncle Sam. In short, these Cop grumblers object to everything that is done by our Govern ment, and demand that it perform impos sibilities —but they object to nothing the Rebels do . .. mm • The proposition offered by Gov Curtis to help volunteering, by allowing town ships which furnish their quota to be ex , cmpted from further draft, has been ac ceDted by the War Department. Tho Department at Washington bai decided to pay to tho wives and familiei of officers or soldiers now confined as pris loners of war, the amount of pay that ma; • 4 be due. The rebels confess that their defeats on the two mountains between Chattanooga and Chickamagua, weie the most dis graceful things that have yet happened to their arms. And some of them charge that their men would not fight. (No wender—for so many are forced to engage !in what they know to be a bad cause, 'that they have uo heart for it, and when ! they see that all is lost they will shrink | duty as far as they can and be safe from I the military hold the slave despots have over their lives.) A coriespondent of the Cincinnati Ga zette, with Gen Averill's expedition in West Virginia, in a letter from New Creek, savs he came across a farm house| I where butter was found. The price asked was five dollars per pound in Confederate; i money , but the old woman was quite will ing to let it go for fifteen cents in postal currency. •--► • • • "Would you throw Yallandigham, an ex-Congressman, into jaii with common i vagabonds 7" askedasensitive copperhead of Judge Holt, when that famous traitor | was arresti d. "Certainly," responded j the Judge, "if the vagabonds don't ob ject." The estate of tlx late Senator Douglas, at Cottage Grove, near Chicago, has been sold to satisfy a mortgage. It consisted :of sixty acres, and brought 883,150, or 8803 less than the amount to satisfy the mortgage. O _ Banks continues successful in Texas, whete there is an undoubted Union | strength to be reached. The Rebels have a report of a victory in Louisiana, not I confirmed by our advices. r The Baltimore American i 9 out for the I re-election of President Lincoln. Thej ! Bedford (Pa.)

It is t he gift of his California friends, aud j is resplendent with gold and jewels. New Haven has elected Union Charter Officers by 115 majority. Last Fall the Seymour Democracy carried their ticket by over 600 majority. A correspondent of the Home Evan gelist says the murders of Quantrell in ! Lawrence, Kansas, made 84 widows and 24U orphans! . Gen. Bragg has been removed from thej | command of the S. W. llebel Army, aud I Gen. Haidee succeeds hitu. Foreign advices indicate that the Old World ha? its own troubles—sufficient to; keep it from meddling with the New. President Lincoln is recovering from ja slight attack of varioloid.

CONSISTENCY. —The Baltimore Atner ! icau says, the latest practical definition of j consistency is to hurra for Jetf Davis,who j enforces a merciless conscription.unu raise mob-. to oppose the very mildest form j under our own established Government. One of our prisoners, just escaped from Tyler, Northern Texas, cays (hat large gangs ot slaves, irequciitiv numbering 500, were constantly passing westward to I 1 the interior of the State. Many of the Texans were looking forward to the time when the French would reduce Mexico to subjugation and make it a slave coun i try ; so that, even if the Union we e rc- j stored, they would have a place of refuge for themselves and human chattels. Richmond papers have despatches from Charleston to the 15th irist. They re port the frequent shelling of the city, on one day with Greek fire; buildings are damaged, but "nobody hurt," (for the possible reason that there is nobody left i lia the city). Fort Sumter had beeu on fire; ten men more killed aud thirty one; wounded. f ii 0m t The army has lost a most efficient and worthy officer. Not three days ago, Gen.! Buford was ordered to the command of the cavalry in the Army of the Cumber land; he was made a Maj.-Gen. at the :tiuie. Yesterday (Dec. 15), Major-Gen. : Buford died of typhoid fever in Wash-1 ington. The hero of a hundred fights, his memory will be cherished by every patriot and friend of his country. .■ ■ • There are indications which point to ja change in the command of tho Depart ment of Missouri Gen Schofield now in Washington may be transferred to Balti more, and either Gen. Schenck or Gen I Rosecrans (probably the latter) ordered to the Missouri Department. Western uien say the change would be highly sat isfactory aod allay all strife. H PROOF OF MARRIAGE. —It not unfre quently happens that clergymen, in inar . ryiog a couple, omit to give a certificate of the marriage, or to make any registra tion of it. Such evidence is rendered 3 especially important just now, as, in the * case of the death of a soldier, the widow P must have a certificate of marriago before i-Va cau receive a po?iou. Toys!
