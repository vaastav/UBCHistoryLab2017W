The harbor commission convenes in this city tomorrow.

ADMIRAL WALKER. PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION beJoro the public knows whither that appropriation will go. Admiral Walket\ who will preside over the commission's deliberations, is ex pected to arrive In the city this after noon. He came west over the Northern Pacific and has tarried at Portland. Or., and at San Francisco. Secretary W. C. Pratt, who will also be fhe'disbursing officer of the f>oard, is already in town. fJEO. S. nORISON-CommlMloner The Westminster hotel parlors will be the commission's Los Angeles headquar ters, and some of the sittings of the j board will be held in the parlors of the j hotel. Colonel Richard Morgan of Dwight, 111., has been in the city for several days. He is a guest at the Westminster hotel. Engineers William H. Burr and George S. Morrison are also expected today. The routine of the commission's ses sions will not be decided upon until they have had a private conference, but some days will in all probability be spent in hearing evidence and arguments front supporters of both sides. Senator White would have appeared as special pleader for San Pedro, and his presence would have been Invaluable, but an urgent summons to Washington concerning an equally momentous ques tion —the funding bill—has prevented that. Able advocates for San Pedro have, however, prepared their briefs. "BUD" 

PRICE IN TROUBLE Fails to Show Up After Being Arrested and a Warrant Will Issue W. J. or "Bud" Price has got himself Into a fresh mess of trouble, being last night placed under arrest for disturb ance of the peace by Officer Miles Long, released upon his word of honor to give himself up as soon as his wife should recover from an attack of heart failure and, having fulled to deliver himself within a reasonable time, will today be rearrested on a warrant and probably be given about one minute to make a start for the police station. The circumstances of the case arc as follows: Last evening a oman giving her name as Mrs. Bryant called at police head quarters and desired the assistance of an officer to help her recover a valise which, she claimed, was unlawfully hell by her former landlady at '827 V& South Main street. It seemed that Mrs. Bry ant had, while occupying a room in the house, broken a jardiniere. She was un able to exactly match the set to which it had belonged and trouble with the landlady ensued. Her goods were loaded •n a wagon for removal when the land lady abstracted the valise from the wag on, declaring that she would hold it until the jardiniere was replaced. It was to recover her valise that Mrs Bryant desired the services of the police, and, declaring herself perfectly willing lo pay for the broken piece, if possible to effect a compromise, Officer Long was sent down with her to patch up a truce. On arrival at the place Price appeared and injected himself into the controver - sy. He became very abusive to Mrs. Bryant and told her that if she was not a woman he would thrash her. but that if she would send her husband around he would lick him anyway. Foul epi thets were applied and, unheeding all warnings from the officer to behave him self, he was arrested despite his asser tion that he was a deputy constable. As Long was taking the prisoner away Mrs. Price, who is said to be subject to heart trouble, fainted and her husband was allowed to go to her assistance, after promising to report promptly to the station to give himself up as soon as he was able to leave her. This he did not do last night, and as a consequence today Officer Long will swear out a war rant and go after him. FIRE ON MAIN STREET. Blaze in the Second Hand Store of J. D. Steel & Co. At 12:25 this morning an alarm of flre was turned In from box 31, at Spring and Second streets, followed shortly there after by box 17, at Main and Third, caus ed by a blaze In the rear of the second hand 9tore of J. D. Steele & Co., at Nos. 255 and 257 South Main street. 'A large shed In the rear of the one-story brick storeroom was found to be on fire and and the flames shot up with a fierceness that Illuminated the scene for a block around. The department responded promptly, headed by Chief Moore and Assistant Kd. Smith, two lines of hose being laid and the lire put out in short order. The blaze was confined to a mass of second hand stuff stored in the shed, the olss on which will not amount to more that) JSOO, covered by Insurance. The Union chop house, run by Steve B. Gocioh, at 253, and the commission and produce store of Sylvan & Levy, at No. 261, were slightly damaged by smoke and water. The origin o fthe (Ire is unknown, but is believed to have been due to spontan eous combustion.

Teribly Injured at San Gabriel John Escandon. a printer, who resided at 508 Amelia street in this city, having been out of a job for some time, started on Sunday night eastward bound. He left the city on a freight train bound for Yuma, but now lies in the receiving hos pital of this city in a terribly critical con dition. At midnight, as the freight train WILLIAM H. BURR-C mm !s : aner reached .San Gabriel, Escandon was sit ting on a lumber car congratulating him self and a companion on their eomriaru tively easy Journey. Suddenly a coup ling snapped and Escandon was Jerked between the cars, the wheels passing over his legs and crushing them into a hopeless mass below the knees. A spec ial engine was dispatched to San Gabriel early this morning, and at 2:30 the poor fellow was brought into the city when he was promptly attended to by the police surgeon. Amputation was at once decided upon, and it is very doubtful if Escandon can survive the operation. The czar of Russia has four separate "services" of horses and carriges; name ly, the Russian, French, English and gala set. Each set comprises at least fifty horses. The Russian set accom panies the emperor wherever he goes, and at Gatchina it is used, together with the English set. liOS ANGELES HERALD: TUESDAY DECEMBER 15, 189©.

Spring St. New mm 4 AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL Scenes at the Opening of Congress WASHINGTON IS AWAKE Pen Pictures of Its Life ond Its People Cleveland's Fear of Assassination—He Is an Unwilling Candidate for Para dise— Brlgham's Gossip (Special Correspondence to The Herald.) WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 7.—Had Speaker Reed been a 220-pound fairy and the silver gavel with which he whacked his desk at noon today a veritable wand, the transformation wrought In the Dis trict of Columbia could not have been greater. Washington without congress Is like the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out. Having no manufactories and little business of its own, and with up wards of 85,000 resident negroes—most of wtoom revel In "sweet Idleness" all sum- , mer and subsist upon charity during the i winter—the city's life depends upon the fact that it is the national seat of govern ment. At the close of a session of con gress everybody not absolutely tied here hurries away—to his home In some other section of the country, to Europe, or sea shore, or mountain resort; the thou sands of department clerks take their annual ttoket-Of-leave at that time, and "D. C." lapses into its normal condition of coma. A few days, before the return of the body politic and the transient multitude that follows in its train, tin city begins to stretch its legs ami show signs of awakening. The long avenues erstwhile empty as Goldsmith's village, are thronged with busy feet: langul&h- I ing trade looks up again, society hiesit ' self back with brand new white placards I bearing the familiar legend, "rooms to I rent." In no other city are these pla- I cards so universally distributed. The i mark upon the doorposts in Herod's day j was as nothing In comparison—for the ' white population of Washington are di j vided into two classes, viz., those who I have lodgings to rent and those who rent lodgings. Every reduced family and dis ' charged department civile and impecu nious widow takes to room renting as i ducks to water, while the well-to-do are I not averse to adding some hundreds to their yearly income (never large enough ; in Washington, whatever the figure) by sparing a suite or two of apartments to congressional fumilies for a "consid -1 eratlon" which would buy the best house of an interior town In one short session, I The truth is, the average Washlngton- I ian to the manor born is an extremely liberal individual—with other people's money—who looks upon the sojourner as lawful prey. In the time-honored role of lodging house keeper he simply wants all you possess—nothing more. Are you a senator, a supreme judge, or only a second-class clerk on a beggarly thou sand a year, it is not necessary to inquire the price for which he will shelter your defenseless head —all he asks is the full amount of your salary. Comparatively few of the victims "board" where they "room," fur here the European fashion prevails of feeding at hotels and res taurants or being served en casa by a caterer. Since time out of mind Wash ington has been celebrated as the grave yard of hotels and newspapers, from in numerable failures in both lines of en terprise. Certainly it is not undue mnd esty in the matter of charges which has brought so many Bonifaces to the wall, but probably because their profits were swallowed up in high rents, which go on unabated during the half year when the capital city is a desert of tenantless hostelries. Hut the coming of congress, like the overflowing of the Nile in thirs ty Egypt, makes the waste places bloom again. Opening day Is always a gala affair, marking the official inauguration of the social as well as the political season, and today was doubly interesting because of the hard-fought campaign that took place during the recess. The weather was perfect, as only a Washington win ter day can be when It tries Its best. The air aa I bracing but balmy, the sky a cloudless blue, and the genial sun glit tered upon the facades and marble walls ! of the public buildings and sniiled broad- ' j ly upon the yet green grass and foliage |in the countless parks that grace this I "city of magnificent distances." At an I early hour the streets leading capitol ward were thronged with kaleidoscopic humanity—all classes, colors and condi tions trending toward the common Mec ca. Gay equipages, drawn by prancing steeds, conveyed the diplomat" and the i more wealthy and prominent in official I life, side by sidle with ramshackle, one horse cabs and nondescript two-wheel ers. The street cars were crowded and j thousands toiled up the hill on foot. Statesmen whose names are household j words in every civilised country; Amer- I lean citizens -.f African descent; sport., pig-tailed Chinamen, ladies of fashion, courtesans, school ma'am tourists, the bridal pairs- whom, like the poor, we have always with us, formed an unorganised civic pageant worthy of Democratic America. The na tional acropolis never looked bet- , ter, and patriotic shirt-fronts swelled ' at the sight of the great white i wings and classic outline:' of the won- | del ful edifice, above Its long marble c*- j planade; Its Corinthian columns, pilas- ! tors, facades and stately entrances ; adorned with colossal statues, and Its enormous dome upholding the figure of j liberty. We tell ourselves with com mendable pride that there are 9,000,000 pound-; of cast Iron In that big dome alone, and that acres and acres are en dured within the capital building, to gether with miles and miles of tile paved corridors and frescoed walls and marble stairways and wonders too nu merous to mention in one short day. And just across it? wide plaza ri t- es the near ly comnl?ted library, Its golden dome and' golden torch all bathed in golden | light, snowy marble wall 3 shining like ' purest alaliaster—the most magnificent | building of its kind in the world. Inside of the capital the same old ' crowd of former years, or one just like I it, packed' every available Inch—fa miliar greatness, clothed in Importance and spick and span attire, and newer legislators obviously oppressed by the conviction that the gaze of an adimlring world is centered upon them; the noble army of majaws, Jedges and other to bacco expectorating gentlemen, for whose convenience a vast array of cus pidors has been vainly set; übiquitous reporters; lobbyists, male and female, buttonholing congressmen with perse- | veranee worthy a righteous cause; seedy men with long-pending claims to urge; sad-faced women, entreating "ap pointments" by which to earn their chil- | dren's daily bread, and women galore whose painted cheeks and amorous eyes tell other tales. There are a few places I in Washington from which the "Scarlet Woman*' Is officially debarred, but t*iere Is no law to restrain her from plying her trade openly in the nation's capitol— | where, perhaps, the scarlet man is not j a stranger. An hour of gay greetings, of pushing and jamming and elbowing for admis sion to the galleries, of animated scenes on the lie.ir of the house and senate, of : noisy demonstrations on the entrance of pratlcularly prominent statesmen, the j buzz and buttle which mark the en- I tranoe of social lights to the reserve I galleries, and then the drop ol the gavel lat precisely 12 meridian announced the j opening of the second session of the Fifty-fourth oongress. Al the same mo ment the judges, In their long black gowns filed solmenly Into the old'senate chamber —now the supreme court room — that place nf hallowed memories, sa cred to the shades of Webster, Calhoun, Clay and a host of illustrious dead.which one enters for the first tinuV with that i feeling strong upon him."Take thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thi.u Btandest Is holy ground!" Hut. i alas! there is not much "holy ground" I nowadays beneath the colossal (loddess i of Liberty. In fact there Is rather too | much liberty of various sorts. One is | not surprised to learn that the bronze ■ goddess aforesaid is' twenty feet high ! and weighs 14.!)t>5 pounds, and that she j Is not more empty of lieart and brazen of cheek than many who walk In her shadow. Every day the opening and closing of i both houses of congress it? heralded by j the prompt raising ard lowering of , Hags upon the roof of either wing; and j when there is a night session, the elec- | I trie light aloft In the dome Is plainly i , visible all over the District of Columbia ! 1 aril in the adjacent states of Maryland : | and Virginia. I There Is never much business accom plished on, opening; day beyond* the regu lar oerpmonles amending the beginning ;of a session, and the receptlor.»of the president's annual cuinmunleatlon to congress. When the Ia c, t ses-ion closed there were two vacancies in the house by death, and since then Speaker Crisp hl'9 gone over to the great majority. Therefore, the first thing to be done after the fall or the gavel was to swear in the new members. Mr. Charles Crisp will succeed his father, but his election will not occur until next week. Mr. William Stokes of South Carolina and ' Mr. C. ,T. Boatner of l.ouisl'nra came up I and said their "cuss words." but neither ' took w hat is konwn as the Ironclad oath, a modified one being administered to fit the circumstances. It is a funny thing, illustrating the in consistency of this great and glorious republic, that every slip of a girl who enters Uncle Samuel's employ lo count ' coupons or patch muster rolls, or paste I seed bags, Is required to make solemn j oath that she has never borne arms ! against the government, and pay 25 ! cents for the privilege out of her own | poof little pocket! On the senate side, Vive-President Stevenson called his boys to order on the stroke of 12. and prayer was offered by the blind chaplian, Rev. Mr. Mlllburn, and presently both houses took a recess while awaiting the president's message. Most of the members remained in their seats during the hours of waiting, and the galleries were packed as closely as nature stowed away her seedlings. Cu rious strangers wiled away the time by j pointing out to one another, with canes and umbrellas the favorite lions in the j arena below. The colored man and j brother, ensconced as usual in tlie j warmest and 1 cosiest corners, tranquilly | sank into the arms of Morpheus, in the I ladies' gallery fans fluttering in jeweled j fingers, and bright eyes sparkling under I picture hats, entice many a Solon to j force a passage through the throng to ! the smiling object of his consideration, Among other distinguished visitors w ere G?neral McMahon and General Horace Porter of New York sitting side by side In the senators' gallery. Mr. Mark Han na. the champion wire-puller of the late campaign was brought in by Senator Sherman, and with the modesty which j so distinguishes him he took a seat aw n j back In the farthest row .right under 1 the "Picadilly weepers" of the bust of President Arthur. The diplomats Vere out in full force and feather. Sir Julian Pauncefote, big and beefy as ever, sat. pompously in the front row. as becomes the ambassador of the queen upon 1 whose domain the sun never sots. Close I by him sat pretty little Mustapha Bey, I the new minister from Turkey, acoom- j ! panied by his secretary, Norighin Ef | fendi, and a couple of attaches. Musta • pha Hey. called the Apollo of the diplo i matic corps, is already a pet among the ladies. With his dear little fez upon his shining black locks, his dark eyes glit tering below like jet bead's set in bronze, he looks like a slim, chocolate-col»*rred ! candle under an extinguisher. The j Spanish ambassador, Senor Depuy de i Lome, was conspicuous by his absence, i but his two secretaries were on hand to I look out for snags In the president' ! mes ] sage concerning Cuba. Mons. Fateno • tre. the French ambassador, and his j young Philadelphia wife, were Interest- I ed spectators, and. even far-off Hawaii was represented by Minister Hatch and , ! Mr. Cooper. Many of the desks In both senate and house were laden with flow ers, the remembrances of loving friends and bids for benefits to come. Mr. Vest of Missouri, the shortest man In the , senate, was completely obscured be hind two tall bouquets, and his colleague. ! Mr. Smith, who is by no mean-: a small man. was not much better oft. Senator Mitchell of Oregon had four towering bouquets—rathet, embarrassment of i tches In that line. Hon. J. D. Hick* had an enormous basket of roses, surmount ed by a yellow ribbon on which the word "Hick " was printed in letters large enough to be read a mile away; and a 3 ; cavil war. attache* which stated that the ; offering- was by the veterans of the ; Twentieth Pennsylvania district "To i our Choice for Governor." Hon. E. E. I Meredith of Virginia received a ponder ous tribute from the board of directors *of the Indian tribal school for colored : youths. ! Two splendid floral crescents labeled ! "Mississippi." were brought in for Sen j tors Walthall and Blackburn, but unf i lunately one of them went a-begging, I for Senator Joe was not on deck. Sena- I lor Thurston's dowers were tied with green, a delicate compliment to his Irish ancestry, perhaps; Senator Cullom's of- I tering was confined with golden ribbon, | long and broad enough to cast a golden i glow al! over the Democratic side, and | Senator Peffet- reveled in a regular sil ver bouquet. Senator-elect Wellington of i Maryland hail a prize collection of white I chrysanthemums; Turner of Georgia, : Howard of Alabama, Gibson of Tenn essee. Loud of California, Lodge, Man tle, Proctor, Bewail, Shoup, Gallinger, were among the liberally remembered. The desk of the late Speaker Crisp made one dark spot on the scene. It was draped in mourning emblems, and above them Mrs. Hlankhead, wife of the rep resentative form Alabama, had placed ' white and purple orchids.and white roses 'en a bed of maidenhair ferns. His por- I trait in the lobby was also festooned j with crape, and the mantel below it i covered with Easter lilies. I The long wait began to grow tedious before Major Pruden. one of the presi dent's secretaries, brought that blessed message for the clerk to read. Vnlike : all his predecessors. President Cleve i land haj* never set his aristocratic foot I within the magnificently appointed mar , bio room provided on purpose for his use In the capltol, but when he has cye j eial business with congress a messenger i must gallop to the White House, more j than a mile away. The quid nuncs sa> 1 that this is due to Mr. Cleveland's well kt iwn fear of assassination. Extraor. dinary precautions fur his safety have ' always been taken, in a quiet way such as an extra detail of policemen aiound the executive mansion and detec tives in citizens' clothes to follow him about on his walks and drives. Verily, w hen ore is sixty, and has the gout, and !Is soon to be an "Ex," one should not be so unwilling a candidate for para dise. During the reading of the mes , sage the closest attention was paid. As usual, it informed congress of all the well-known happenings of the past year —as some good people In their prayers make it a point to post the Lord on his own business. The representatives of Spain leaned over the rail and their faces were a study during the discourse on Cuban matters: and when he came to that portion referring to prospectivs action to stop Turkish atrocities which have shocked the civilized world Mou stapha Hey and his satellites abruptly left the senate, the tails of their little fezes trembling with indignation.
