In their Insistent demand for the severest punishment of the Chinese the mission aries seem to be actuated as much by re venge as by justice. The man who prides himself on not wad ing: through the President's message has Jest the one opportunity to know what the government is doing. The preliminary report of the isthmian canal "commission settles the controversy regarding routes by unanimously recom mending the Nicaraguan. This clears the way for further action. The Democratic members of the House seera disposed to extend the present law relative to the army another year, which means an extension of the expensive sys tem of sending men enlisted for a year to the Philippines. ' The City Council has been placed in a bad light by the refusal of nearly half its members to order an investigation of the charge that certain members have been guilty of soliciting bribes. No honest man ever fears an investigation, and when eight members of a public body out of twenty vote to suppress an investigation of charges 8 netting some of their number the public is apt to draw unfavorable conclusions. . Trial by Jury Is about as fair a method of arriving. at Justice as can be devised, and, while juries may sometimes err, the presumption is In favor of the correctness of their findings. The fact that ex-Councilman Iligglns asserts his ' innocence of the crime for which he was convicted will not change public sentiment. He is to be pitied for having put himself in his present position, but his offense was flagrant. It Is important that public officials should be made to understand the sacredncss of a public trust. It Is probable the next large public build ing erected at Washington will be a hall of public records. The erection of such a building is the subject of one of the minor recommendations In the President's mess age. It has become necessary to relieve th5 various department buildings of the ac cumulated files and records of more than a hundred years. These accumulations have become so great as to be a serious impedi ment to public business and a source of some danger from Are and wreckage. The work of removing, classifying and arrang ing them will be very great, but it cannot be much longer deferred. The crowned heads of Europe have been thrown into something like a cold sweat by the arrival there of former President Krü ger, and their various devices to avoid meeting him are rather amusing. 'Emperor Willlara sent word that on account of his position already taken he would not be able to see Mr. Krugcr. This was notice that his presence in Berlin was not desired. Francis Joseph, of Austria-Iluncary, had Ids minister send word that "he had maüe other dispositions for the next few weeks." Emperor Nicholas, of Russia, will, it Is said, meet Mr. Kruger at Nice or Mcntone, "where the Czar's physicians have advised him to go for convalescence," thus avoid ing the necessity of either meeting the cx Frcsident oi Russian soil or sending him word that Lis visit L not desired. Alto gether, it cannot be said that Oom Paul Is receiving a watm welcome In Europe. Of Course, the diplomatic rebuffs he la re ceiving are tccause of the unwillingness of the powers to give offense to England by meddllng in a quarrel which is distinctly her own Eugene V. Debs. Social Democratic can didate for President, received about lOü.öoo votes. This does not count much In a pop ular vote of lCtVuxOiO. but it represents a phase of current thought. In 1S24 Andrew Jackson was elected President by a popu lar vote of I33.S72. and even with that small vot.e had a plurality of Vi.ZZl over John Q. Adams, the next highest candidate. Mr. Debs need not be ashamed of his vote nu merically. As for his principle?, the Jour nal believes he is a sincere but erratic man. He says that the Republican party having triumphed, the "trusts will run riot In the spoil! of conquest," and he predicts that when the development of capitalism reaches Its greatest momentum in the sec ond McKlnloy administration consumption will not keep pace with production and a crash vill come. "Then," says he. "the working class will get in full measure what they voted for." There will be "glutted markets, paralyzed factories, silent mills, deserted mines, enforced Idleness, reduced waaea, strikes, lockouts, injunctions, sol diers and the funerals of worklngmen in rapid succession. There will be no work for the hand, and the brain will have a chance." This is a dark view and the Jour nal thinks a very erroneous one. The gen eral opinion among the most sagacious business men of the country la that it has taken a new lease of prosperity and is en tering on a longer period of good times than usual. Mr. Debs is too bright a man to become a chronic croaker. He should Join the procession of prosperity. risiu.g the siiip-sihsidy hill. It appears that the Republican sena torial committee on order of business has decided that the ship-subsidy bill shall take the place of the Spooner Philippines bill, thus placing it at the head of the calendar as unfinished business. If the Journal correctly interprets this action it must express its regret. It seems to indi cate a purpose to force the bill through under a sort of whip-and-spur policy, to "jam" it through as quickly as posible, in the mistaken idea that this will meas urably forestall popular opposition. That view is never a sound one. If a measure cannot stand analysis, discussion and pop ular agitation it is presumably bad. and rushing it through Congress is calculated to increase popular opposition Instead o. forestalling or diminishing it. The Journal's opposition to the ship sub sidy bill is based on grounds of principle, of policy, of economy and the absence of popular demand or the prospect of general benefit. It does not believe that the pay ment of money subsidies for the develop ment or encouragement of any particular industry is defensible on grounds of prin ciple. It cannot be defended on the same grounds as a protective tariff, because the main purpose of the latter is to raise rev enue, and the protection afforded to home industries confers an equal and impartial benefit on all classes. A money subsidy spends revenue Instead of raising it, and Its benefits to others than Its immediate recipients are remote and conjectural. Every dollar of subsidy must be raised by taxation, and taking money out of the pockets of all the people to put it in the pockets of comparatively a few is wrong in principle. The substitution of a sub sidy instead of a protective tariff duty on sugar, as was done by the tariff act of 1S00. did not work satisfactorily and was repealed by the law of 1S0G. which restored the protective duty. As that was the only instance in which Congress ever resorted to a money subsidy to encourage or pro mote a particular industry, and as that was abandoned, it may be fairly said that the passage of a ship subsidy bill would be a new departure in American legisla tion. Most of the States which passed laws paying subsidies for beet sugar have repealed them or are preparing to do so. On the question of economy the Journal does not believe that the passage of a bill which will give to a particular industry or those engaged in a particular vocation several million dollars a year for thirty years, amounting in the aggregate to more than 50,000,000, can be successfully defended before the people at a time when they are asking for a reduction of war taxes when the ordinary, necessary ex penses of the government are steadily in creasing and when there is an imperative demand for an increase of the army. There Is a popular demand for economy in appropriations and expenditures, but there is no evidence of a popular demand for a ship subsidy. It is not believed that a single Republican state convention has declared for it. Certainly no Western State has done so. The Republican na tional platform of IKK contained the fol lowing: We favor restoring the American policy of discriminating duties for the upbuilding of our merchant marine and the protec tion of our shipping In the foreign carry ing trade, so that American ships may re gain the carrying of our foreign trade. This calls for 'friendly legislation, but not for a subsidy. The subsidy plan Is of comparatively recent origin and growth. Its adoption would be indefensible on grounds of economy as well as of prin ciple. Not only Is there no popular demand for such a measure, but there is no reason to believe that it would benefit any person outside of those engaged In building and running ships, and of these classes it would benefit only those who least need it the large builders and ocean liners, and not small ones.- The Chicago Tribune re gards the pending bill as "peculiarly in iquitous because it proposes to bestow special favors on a few particular lines which already have most liberal mall con tracts." The Tribune predicts that mem bers of Congress who vote for the pending bill will not hear the last of it for many years. "Representatives, especially those from the middle West," it says, "who have been re-elected and who wish to re main in political life, should be cautious about committing themselves to a meas ure which their constituents do not fa vor." Such expressions as these should not be unheeded. Congressmen must not mistake the atmosphere of Washington for that of the 'country at large, or the clamor of a few shipbuilders and owners and their lobby for the voice of the peo ple. Let Republican members go back to the platform of 1SDS, which demanded the upbuilding of our merchant marine and carrying trade by other methods than a money subsidy. riir.siuH.vr jfkinley's imperial ism. A noticeable feature of the President's message Is Its freedom from anything like personallsm or self-expleltatlon. From be ginning to end it 13 the message of a man who is wholly absorbed in the duties of his office and solicitous only for the welfare of the country. That is characteristic of Mr. McKinley. He is a modest man and far j more concerned about public duties than I about personal glorification. One who sat I rear him at his home in Canton on the night of the presidential election says that as the dispatches came in from all parts of the country indicating great Republican gains and the certainty of his re-election he did not once, by word or sign, give the slightest Indication of personal exultation or triumph. Every remark he made showed that he was rejoicing far more over the t-ucc ss of what he considered right prin ciples and the assurance of the country's welfare than over his personal victory. That la the dominant note of his message. Having been re-elected, after a somewhat stormy first administration, he might have been forgiven for a reference to his second indorsement by the people. Washington made such a reference In the first annual message of his second term, when he ex pressed "to my fellow-citizens at large the deep and respectful sense wh!ch I feel of the renewed testimony of public approba tion." and referred to "the affectionate partiality with which I have been honored by the country." Jefferson made a similar allusion in the first message of his second terra when he spoke of "this first occasion of addressing Congress since, by the choice of my constituents, I have entered on a second term of administration." In Presi dent McKlnley's message there is not a word to show that he has been chosen for a second term or that he regarded the ver dict of the people as an escape from na tional disaster. Neither is there any refer ence to the vicious doctrines and sham Is sues which were put down. Perhaps the nearest approach to such a reference is the following: At the outgoing of the old and the In coming of the new century you begin the last session of the Fifty-sixth Congress with evidences on every hand of Individual and. national prosperity and with proof of the growing strength and increasing power for good of republican institutions. Your countrymen will join with you in felicita tion that American liberty is more firmly established than ever before, and that love for it and the determination to preserve it are more universal than at any former period of our history. The Republic was never so strong, be cause never so strongly Intrenched in the hearts of the people as now. The Constitu tion, with few amendments, exists as it left the hands of its authors. The additions which have been made to it proclaim larger freedom and more extended citizenship. Popular government has demonstrated in its 124 years of trial here its stability and security, and its efficiency as the best in strument of national development and the bst safeguard to human rights. Every word of this is a repudiation of the doctrine of imperialism, although that word is not mentioned. When the Presi dent says, as he does truly, that the Re public was never as strong as it Is to-day, because It was never before so strongly Intrenched in the hearts of the people, he shatters the whole charge of Imperialism in one sentence. President McKinley Is too modest to In dulge in self-gratuiatlon and too magnani mous to refer to the defeat of an opponent. No President was ever more consecrated to an impersonal discharge of duty. The President calls the attention of Con gress to and asks favorable action on a bill now pending to carry into execution Article 7 of the treaty of peace with Spain by which the United States assumed the payment of certain claims for indemnity of its citizens against Spain. The article of the treaty referred to is as follows: The United States and Spain mutually re linquish all claims for Indemnity, national and individual, of every kind, of either government, or of its citizens or subjects, against the ether government, which may have arisen since the beginning of the late insurrection in Cuba and prior to the ex change of ratifications of the present treaty, including -all claims for int enmity for the cost of the war. The United States will adjudicate and settle the claims of its citizens against Spain relinquished in this article. This article makes the United States re sponsible to American citizens for all claims against Spain for Injuries to per sons or property done by either Spanish sol diers or the Cuban insurgents during the insurrection which preceded the war with Spain. It is probable the claims will amount t several hundred thousand dollars, and if the usual process of padding is followed they may amount to some millions. Of course, they will be examined and verified, but when ascertained Congress will have to pay them. According to the Washington Post a plan is on foot to place Representative Boutelle, of Maine, on the retired list of the navy preparatory to his resigning hh seat in the House. The Post says: A bill to accomplish this has already been prepared and will probably be pre sented In the House within a few days. It will be proposed that he be placed on the retired list with the rank of captain. In view of the conspicuous service which he .rendered as a volunteer officer of the navy during the civil war. The proposition is entirely indefensible, and should meet with no favor in Congress. Mr. Boutelle, though presumably a worthy and patriotic man, is a civilian and not a naval officer. At present he Is under treatment In a sanatorium for brain trouble. To place him on the naval retired list with the rank of captain would simply be granting him a large pension for life. Such a thing would not be thought of if Mr. Boutelle were not a member of Con gress, and ctrtainly that furnishes no jus tification for the proposed action. It would establish a bad precedent. What? Can it be true that the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, now in ses sion in Washington, has unanimously ac cepted an Invitation to the White House Thursday evening? It is very reprehensible if Mr. McKinley Is as bad a man as some of the members have charged him with being.

JOINT SESSION" OF COtNCIL AND 1IOISE OF DELEGATES. - Governor llenK 3IesaKe Well Re ceived Severn! Recommendation of Importance to Natives. . SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, Dec. 4. The Porto Rica n House of delegates, which was harmoniously organized yesterday, Senor Manuel F. Uossy being elected speaker, met to-day In joint session with the execu tive council, the two bodies adopting a res olution to cable greetings to President Mc Kinley. Governor Allen's message was well re ceived. After congratulating the people of Porto Rico on the -meeting of their first legislative assembly, the Governor points out that the finances of the island are In a satisfactory condition, showing a balance of 

J1.GS3.4D6. The receipts from May to October, inclusive, were $1,041,GD6. Ths sum of $200.Gtö, the balance due from the cus toms, will be used to refund the chief rev enue customs which cease in 1902. The Governor recommends an equitable system of taxation including excise, in heritance tax, and a direct tax upon real estate, together with a general valuation of all property and the abolition of munici pal taxes. He announces that there are now S00 schcols in the island, an Increase of 1S4 during the last year, and recom mends that this number be augmented and that increased appropriations be made for elementary' education. The reorganization of the judiciary and the jury system is also recommended, and an argument is made in favor of simpler forms of municipal government, the sug gestion being that municfpalities be divided into thrc-e classes, according to tho popula tion of the towns. Governor Allen asks for a repeal of the order giving alcaldes Judicial power and recommends the estabdshment of boards of supervisors, similar to those in Massachusetts. He praises the insular police, but thinks the force should be in creased for all towns having populations under twenty thousand. More roads are recommended. The message advises that the United States Congress be petitioned to deepen, widen and clear San Juan harbor. It calls attention to tho fact that there aro six hundred and fifty persons confined in the four jails of tho island and says that addi tional prisons are needed. It recommends asylums for the blind and crippled, as well as poor houses and other similar institu tions. . The house of delegates submitted to the Governor a petition for tho pardon of all persons imprisoned on political charges since the commencement of tho American occupation. The executive council has decided not to grant a subsidy to the French Railroad Company, but it has granted a franchise for the construction of a pier at Ponce to J. D. Luce. Fit YE SPEAKS. (CONCLUDED FROM FIRST PAGE.) tion with a line of Spanish ships exactly similar in size and speed to the American ships. The Spanish vessels had a yearly advantage of $120,000 over the American ships, and could make money carrying freight at 5 a ton, while the American ves sels, in order to make money had to charge $7.fi0 per ton. Mr. Roach was forced to sell the line of vessels, and Mr. Thurber and other purchasers of the ships eventually lost their entire investment. Mr. Frye then took up that provision of the bill which provides the amount of sub sidy to be paid vessels and explained how the payment would be regulated. He said that by the terms of the measure a ten knot vessel out for 173 days would draw $15,000 a year beyond the cost of her coal and handling, and that the amount of sub sidy would in percentage diminish with the increase of the speed of the whip. - Mr. Clay, of Georgia, asked if It were true that a twenty-one-knöt ship would draw, under the bill, $301.000 a year. Mr. Frye replied that the amount drawn by such a vessel would be about $22,000 in excess of her coal consumption and hand ling. "But." persisted Mr. Clay, "Is not the gross amount of the subsidy of the twenty-one-knot ship $304,000 per year under this bill?" Mr. Fry e admitted that it was. "I understand," said Mr. Clay, "that the ten-knot and twelve-knot ships, which carry the agricultural products of the coun try, do not receive more than one-third tho subsidy of the fast passenger vessels, which carry no agricultural products." "And I was showing," responded Mr. Frye, "that the low-speed vessels were the ones which received the actual benefits from the subsidy and not the fast passen ger ships." At this point Mr. Frye yielded the floor for the day, and the Senate, at 3:55 p. m., held a brief executive session, after which it adjourned. Senator Ve.it Amendment. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Just before the adjournment of the Senate to-day Senator Vest gave notice of an amendment he will offer to the ship subsidy bill. The amend ment provides for the repeal of such ex isting laws "as cither prohibit or restrict citizens of the United States from pur chasing ships built in other countries to be used In the foreign carrying trade of the United States, or which Impose taxes, bur dens or restrictions on Mich ships when owned by American citizens which are not imposed on ships built in the United States." In addition to the repealing provisions the amendment makes it lawful for all citizens of the United States to buy ships built in whole or in part in any for eign country and have them registered as ships of the United States. When so reg istered these foreign-built vessels are un der the terms of the amendment to be en titled to all the rights and subjected to the same regulations as those governing ships built in the United States and owned by citizens of this country. . ARMY DILL IX THE HOISE. It "Will He Considered To-Day Under a. Special Order. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. The session of the House to-day was brief. The real work will begin to-morrow' when the House will consider the army reorganization bill, which X'r. Hull, chairman of the commit tee on military affairs, reported to-day. He explained the urgent necessity for im mediate action on this measure, as under the present law the army must be reduced to 27,000 on July 1 next, and asked unan imous consent for consideration of the bill to-morrow, but Mr. Sulzer, of New York, objected, so Mr. Hull introduced a resolution for a special order for considera tion of the bill to-morrow with provision for a vote at the end of six hours' general debate. The objection to the swearing in of Mr. Connor, of Iowa, the successor of Senator Dolliver, which was raised by Mr. Bailey, of Texas, was removed to-day b"y the pre sentation of a new set of credentials from Governor Shaw, and Mr. Connor took the oath. Three bills were pasted under the call of committees, the most Important being one to provide for the detail of not to exceed 100 retired army officers and 200 non commissioned officers as military instruc tors in the public schcols of such cities a3 adopt a system of military instruction. Th. others were "to prevent the failure of military Justice." and to legalize an issue of $250,000 of bonds by Tlma county, Arizona Territory. The resignation of Mr. Devries, of Cali fornia, who is now a member of the board of general appraisers, was laid before th House, as was the resignation of Mr. Bab cock, of Wisconsin, as a member of the committee on insular affairs. The speaker announced the appointment of Mr. Hamilton, of Michigan, as a member of the committee on insular affairs; llr. Overstreet. of InSlana. as chairman of tho committee on expenditures in the Depart ment of Justice, and Mr. Davis, of Florida, and Mr. McDermott, of New Jersey, as members of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries. Mr. Hull, chairman of the military affairs committee, then reported the army reor ganization bill. The volunteers under the present law, he said, must be mustered out July 1 and every one must feel the im perative need of providing for a new army He asked unanimous consent that the blil bo taken up to-morrow. "I object." said Mr. Sulzer. "If the gen tleman desires to consider the bill he can bring in a rule." The usual resolution for the distribution of the President's message was adopted. The House then proceeded to business un der the call of committees and adjourned at 1:33 p. m. .The bill reported by the House military committee to-day is the Root bill amended. Most of these changes have been reported. Two sections were added to the bill to day, the first of which Is meant to cover the case of General Shafter and the last of Gen. Fitzhugh Lee and James Wilson. These sections are: "Section 41. That the President is hereby authorized to seiect from the retired list of the army an officer not above the rank of brigadier general who has distinguished himself during the war with Spain in com mand of a separate army and to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, the officer so selected to be major general United States army, with the pay and allowances established by law for offi cers of that grade on the retired list. "Sec. 42. That the President Is author ized to select from the brigadier generals of the volunteers two volunteer officers, without regard to age, and appoint them brigadier generals United States army for the purpose of placing them upon the re tired list." Other amendments are: "The increase of the officers of artillery shall be in propor tion to the increase of the number of men. The adjutant general shall have the rank of a major general during the active serv ice of the present incumbent and there after the rank of brigadier general. The age limit for appointment to staff posi tions Is stricken out. The surgeon general is authorized In emergencies to appoint as many contract surgeons as may be necessary. 

PRESBYTERIANS MEET COMMITTEE PREPARING A REPORT ON REVISION OF THE CREED. Vote of the Presbyteries ns Tabulated by Dr. Roberts General Harri son at the Session. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. The committee of clergymen and laymen appointed by the last General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to make a recommendation to the next General Assembly, which meets in May, on the question of whether there shall be a revision of the Confession of Faith, assembled here to-night, and will continue in session to-morrow until their work is completed. The committee consists of Charles A. Dickey, Herrick Johnson, Sam uel J. NIccolls, Daniel W. Fisher, William McKibbin, George B. Stewart, Samuel P. Sprecher, Henry Van Dye, Benjamin Har rison, John M. Harlan, Daniel R. Noyes, E. W. C. Humphrey, William R. CrabUe, John,E. Parsons, Elisha A. Frazer. Rev. S. W. Dona, of Philadelphia, the only absent member of the committee, is in Europe. Dr. William Henry Roberts, of Philadel phia, the stated clerk of the General As sembly, i3 acting as the secretary of the committee. Dr. Roberts laid before the committee a tabulation showing the vote of the presbyteries on the questions sub mitted by the General Assembly's commit tee on revision. It made the following showing: For revision of the Confession of Faith, 44 Presbyteries; for an explanatory statement, 10: for a supplemental statement of doctrine, 47; for a revision and a supple mental statement, 14; for a substitute creed, 15. Forty-five presbyteries voted to dismiss the whole subject, while 43 bodies in this and foreign lands made no response. The total number of bodies reporting ag gregated 232. No definite action was taken by the com mittee to-night. Three hours were spent in discussion of the results shown by the re sponses received by the committee and in an exchange of views as to the recommen dation to be made to the General Assem bly. This may be determined on to-mor-rcw, to 'which time the committee ad journed. SOUTHLAND'S NEW MOTTO. "No Polities, No Sectionalism, but business," Says Gen. Gordon. NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 4.-The Southern Industrial convention opened here to-day with a fine attendance, both in numbers and in personnel. Gov. W. W. Heard de livered the address of welcome in behalf of the State, calling attention to the won derful scope and purpose of the convention. He pointed out that with the greatest "un developed resources of any part of the globe without any, exceptions, the South shqpld also become the greatest manufac turing center of the world and that it lay within the scope of aims and purposes of this convention to make It such. "The time is near at hand," said he, "when the great est portion of the annual cotton crop of the cotton belt will be manufactured right here in our midst with tho looms and spindles of our own mills, our own native labor furnishing the genius." Gen John B. Gordon, of Georgia, tho next speaker, said. In regard to politics, adverting to the subject through indirect, reference to the motto of the convention: "No politics, no sectionalism, but busl- For her and her children the South asks no narrpw policies, no Chinese walls, but she looks with palpitating heart toward the boundless Orient as an outlet for her great staple. She wants the Nicaraguan canal, connecting the eastern and western oceans. She asks for the open door and a wide open one for markets for 11.000,000 bales of cotton, which she will in the not far dis tant future convert into clothing for the nations. She bids China and far-off islands of the sea tear down their walls, to lift high the gates and let her come in, and I want to say just here, that the day is not far distant when there shall come from these redeemed millions the loud hosannas, praying God for the presence of the Ameri can flag and the hope of American free dom." TRUST TO BE IGNORED. Wholesale Grocers Will Purchase Re fined SnRar "Where They Please. NEW YORK, Dec. 4. At a well-attended meeting of the Wholesale Grocers' Asso ciation of New York and vicinity, an asso ciation which comprises the leading gro cery Jobbers in thi3 section of the country, it was decided to throw off all restraints in regard to the purchase and sale of re fined sugars. President G. Waldo Smith, of the association, said after the meeting that no definite action had been taken In the way of securing a readjustment of the sugar business, and an adjournment had been taken without date. The entire mat ter had been left in the hands of the executive committee to recommend proper action. In the meantime . 'the members Of the association would purchase from the' refiners offering sugar at the lowest prices and would sell at tiuch prices us they con sidered for the best Interests of their busi ness. The action of the local wholesale grocers la important for the reason that New York has been one of the sections which has most steadfastly maintained the price of sugar. Their position es regards the factor plan is shown by the last annual address of President Smith, in which he advocated action in the direction of securing the restoration of the factor plan by the sugar refiners and the restoration also of the affidavit system, with a rebate of 20 cents per one hundred pounds and the trade dis count of 1 per cent. He also advocated the adoption of the factor plan by all whose soods are capable of being handled in that manner.
