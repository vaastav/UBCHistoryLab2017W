The 1'erfldoii Harper, Ml Holmes ami ounc Uopkiu ew ork V orlil " Interviews Cona-reiinen on Tariff and Presidential rrefereucee. Br the Associated Press. Ciminnati, Hoc. S. Publication in to day's Commercial Gazette of Its special dispatch from Washington about an attempt to bribe District Attorney Iturnett, was headed. "The defense make an unsuccess ful attempt to bribe Sir. Hurnett." When court convened In the Harper case District Attorney Huruett made a personal state ment, sainit that he especially desired it to be understood that there was no ground, whatever, for invnlvini; tiie counsel now representing the defense In any such state ment or insinuation. Judge Jackson thought It due to counsel for defense to say that so far as the court could judge their conduct had been all that honorable gentlemen could demand. J nil to Sage said he w ished to correct a statement 1 1 the publication which ascribed to mm previous kuowledge of attempted bribery. lie said he had no information on the sub ject vv hatcver. The prosecution made no reference at all to the publication of the cipher letters be tween Harper and Miss Holmes. Mr. Hajes milshed his testimony, and with It the government rested its case. The defense called Mr. Kckert for the purpose of finishing Its cross-examination. The En;uircr, this morning, prints fac simile cipher letters, which it says were furnished bv Charles Hopkins, son of As sistant Cashier Hopkins. These purport to be letters seut by Harper to Miss Josie Holmes, hlj former exchange clerk. It is explained that after the failure Harper professed the warmest friendship for his- assistant cashier. Hopkins, and promised to do everj thing that could be done to shield hiui. Young HnpfciiiswascorrespondingI kind to Harper and became his messenger to cvry letters to and from Miss Holmes. While doing this he began to suspect that Ilarpe r w s arranging to throw upon Hop kins (his fall 1. r) the responsibility of all transactions with the grain brokers, and yjmng Hopkins to place Harper wlthiu his pjwer, conceived the bold design of con ceding the letters and delivering verbal messages only. This worked w ell enough mill Miss Holmes Isited the jail. Harper wis furious upon learning of treachery of his messenger, and has since been cold to ward Hopkins. The letters were in a cy pher, which was easily read. Harper also sent thtee checks to Miss Holmes, which Hopkins suppressed and turned over to Djtrict Attorney ltumett. They aggre gated STOO.OOO. and It is pre sumed they were intended to be placed so as to cover up some of the crooked transactions of his bank. The letters of Harper to Miss Holmes are as ardent as those ol ary Jover couId.be. Jn the first one he instructed her about what she should say in her testimony. She an swered, say ing she would be as evasive as she could, but feared she could not tetify as be wanted her to, and asked him why he did not go when he had a chance? She asked him to send her a lawyer to advise her how to testify. To this Harper replied with mad protestations ot love for ills "bright anger and upbraided her for her eoiduess, and especially for ffer cold sug- titn that he should have flown. It looked to him as though she wanted to get rid of h'm. He reminded her of his talk during their last ride together; that he said the worst thing would bo their separation, and t lat she said that would never be. and, p-essiug a kiss on his lips, said she would go to prison with him, or if that coald nut be, would visit him daily. He begged her to get well and come to hUi before she got Into the safe deposit box, otherwise all would be spoiled. He also urged her to take no mom of the drug, and to decline to be interviewed. In one of her notes Miss Holmes said to Harper: 'Your wife has S.500,000. 1 have nothing to do but die, with your family disgracing me as they have done in the last two days." E Ivvard M. Watson, the attorney ent frmn Washington te assist District Attor ney Uurnett in the Harper trial, died sud denly last ev enlng at the residence of Dr. Kemper, from rupture of a blood vessel. Harper was seen at the jail this mnrnirg by a reporter and was asked what he had to say about the publication of his letters to Miss Holmes. Harper iiaused a moment and then Willi clenched teeth said: "You can say that Charley Hopkins did not publUh the other letters tnat would hive benefited me as much as it would his lather and that he did not publish an) thing nut the 10 I gave him for her. Now will you excuse me." There Is no doubt of the authenticity of the letters. Cttfigreftaiii,-!! on Cleveland ami IStnine. Xfw Youk. Dec 8.

In fact, they want the col ored settlement to remain. The fort ob tains its labor of all kinds from the colored wotknien.

Mr. Blaine, Across tie Ocean. Strikes Hard and Swiftly at the Pres ident's Message. Urn DlMect the Iitcuraent Flee by Iiic and llolila III Kullnrir. I i to the Morld-llrtlllanl , xpiMlttoii' of IU WenWnr... I DNkw Youk, Dec. 8.- The Tribune this morning contains a long interview with Hon. James G. lilalno on President Cleve land's message. It was taken lit short hand under tho direction of the Trlhynr'x Pans correspondent and sent by caole last night. The following is an abstract of the interview: "I have been reading an abstract of the president's message and hav e been rspecIaL ly interested In the comments of tiie Lon don papers. Those papers all adaumo to declare the message a free-trade manifes to, and evidently are anticipating an en larged market for English fabrics In the United Mates as a consequence of the pres ident's recommendations. Perhaps that fact stamped the character of the message more clearly than any words of mine can." "lou don t mean actual free trade with out dut)?" queried the leporter. ".No," replied Mr. lilaine, "nir do the Landon papers mean that. Theyaiuiply mean that the president has recommended what, in the United States, is known as a reveuua tariff, rejecting the protective fea ture as an object and not even permitting protection to result fieely as an incldeut to revenue duties." .. 'I don't know that 1 quite comprehend that last point," said the reporter-!- "1 mean," said Mr lilaine, "trit for the first time in the history of ths' United States the president recoiiimrndsjretalning the Internal tax in order that the tariff may lie forced down even below thi fair revenue staudtrd. He recommends tint the tax on tobacco 1m: retained and this that many uiillions annually shall be levied on a do mestic product which would far batter come from a tariff on foreign fabrics."' l nen uo you mean lo imply that you wou'il favoi the repeal vt l lie tobacco tax ?' "Certainly: I meaii just, that."' said Mr. lilaine. "1 should urge that it be done at once, even betoro tho Christmas holidays, it would m the ursi puce brlngi great re lief to growers of tobacco all over the country, and would, moreover, m-teriilly lessen the price of the article to consumers. Tobacco, to millions ot men. i a necessity. The pres'dent calls it a luxury, but It is a luMiry In no other sene than tea and cof fee are luxuries. It is well to-' remember that the luxury of yesterday becomes a I.e- cesslty of today." t "Well, then, Mr. B'aine. would you ad vise the repeal of the whisky t4X also?" "No. I would not. Otlur considerations than those of financial administration are to be taken Into account with regard to whisky. There is a moral site to it. To ihea pen tho price of whisky is to increase the consumption euoruously. There would be no sense In urging the refornl wrought by higli license in miny states if the l.a tlnnal government neutralizes the good ef fect by making whisky within the reach of every'one at twenty cents a gallon Whisky has done a vait deal of barm in the I'u'ted States. 1 would try to make it do some goed. 1 would use the tax to fortify our cities on the sealioaid. Never before in the history f the. world has any government al'owed creat cities on the seaboard, like Philadelphia, Now York, liostoti. Baltimore, Sax Orleans and Sail Francisco, to remain defenseless." BuL-said tho reporur. "vou don't think we aratohave war ... any dlree- tion? "Certainly not," said Mr. Blaine. "Neither, I presume, did Mr. Tiiden when he wrote bis remarkable letter. But we should change a remote chance into an ab solute Impossibility. If our wetk and ex posed points were strongly fortined; if to day we had by any chance eveu such a w ar as we had with Mexico our enemy could procure lron-ciads in Europe that would menace our great cities with destruction or lay them under contribution." "But would notour fortifying now pos sibly look as If we expected war? ' "Why should It any more than the forti fications made sev enty or eighty y ears ago by our grandfathers, when they guarded themselves against successful attack from the armaments of that day. We don't nec essarily expect a burglar because we lock our doors at night, but if by any possibility a burglar comes. It contributes vastly to our peace of mind and our sound sleep, to feel that he can't get In." "But after the fortifications should be constructed, would you still maintain the tax on whisky?" "Yes," said Mr. Blaine, "so long as there Is whisky to tax I would tax it. and when the national government should have no Use for the money, 1 would divide the tax among the federal union, with the specific object of lig) tepjug tliu tax on real estate The houses and farms of the w hole country pay too large a proiiortijn of the total taxes." "Besides your general and sweeping op positirn to the president's rertinmenda tion. have you any further specific objec tion?" "Yes." answered Mr. Blaine, "I should seriously object to tho repeal of the duty on wool. 1 repeal tint vvoul I work great injustice to mauy interests, and would seri ously discourage what we should earnestly encourage, namely, tl. sheep rulttirs among farmers throughout the United States." "Do you think if the president's recom mendation w ere adopted it would increase our export trade.'" "Possibly in some few articles of pecu liar construction it might, but it would increase our import trade ten fold as much in the great staple fabrics, in woolen and cotton good,. In iron, in steel, m all the thousand aud one shapes in winch they are wrought. How are we to export staple fabrics to the markets of Kurope. unless we make them cheaper than they do In Europe, and how are we to manufacture them cheaper than they do in Europe unless we get cheaper la bor than they have in Europe?" "Then you think that the o""stion of la fa r underlies the whole subject?" ' Of course it does," replitsi Mr. Blilne. "It is. in fact, the entire question When ever w can force carpenters, masons, iron workers and meclianiis in every department tn work as cheaply aud live as poorly in tho United States as similar workmen in Eu rope, we can, of ci urse. manufacture jut as cheaply as they do in England and France. But 1 am totally opposed to a pol icy that would enta'l such results. To at tempt it is equiv alent to a social and finan cial revolution, one that would bring untold distress." "But those holding the president's views," remarked the reporter, "are always quoting the treat prosperity of the couvtry under the tariff of lslo " "That tariff did not involve the one de structive pilnt reinminended by the presi dent, namely, the retaining of direct in tenial taxes In ordir to abMUh J idin ct taxes lev led on foreign fib'ies But the country had peculiar advantages un'er it by the Crimean war involving England, France and It is. Is and laigly luipilriin: their trade. All thrse I icldeuts, or ael dent", if yon cl ooe, were immensely stim ulating to trade in ttie United States, rt gardless of the nature of our tariff." "But what about the existing surplus?" "Iheabstratt of the message I have sepn." replied Mr. Blaine, "contains no reference to that point. 1 therefore make no comment further than to indorse Mr, Fred Grant's remark that a surplus is al ways easier to handle than a deficit." "How will the president's message be taken in I be south?" 1 don't dare answer that question. The truth. bs been so long obscured by certain local questions, unreasoning prudence, that nobod y can hope fur Industrial enlighten ment among their leaders just yet. But in my view the south, above all sections of Iho Union, needs a protective tariff. The two Virginias, North Carolina, Kentucky, .Missouri, Ten- nssee, Alabama and Georgia have e lormoiis resources and facilities for devel oping and handling manufactures. They cannot do anything without protection. Kven fie progress o vast as some of these states unite will he checked If the president'- mesvage Is enacted into law." "Wi'l not tho president's rtcommenda tlon t idmit raw material find strong sup port"" "Not by wise protectionists in onr time. Perhaps some greedy manufacturers may think that with free coal or free Iron-ore. they can do great things, but If they should succeed in trying well, as b-iy s say , they win eaten it on rebound. If any man can give a reason why we should ar range the tariff to favor the raw material of other countries In competition against our material of the same kind, I should like to hear II. Should that recommandation of the president be approved it would turn 100,000 American laborers out of employ ment.'' "What must be the marked and general effect of the president's message?" "It will bring the country where it ought to be brought to a full and fair contest on the question of protection. The president himself makes it the one issue bv nresen t ...s..u inner iii ins no-wage, i nim well to have the nuesttim settled. Th, democratic party in power H a standing menace to the industrial prosperity of the country. Tint menace should be removed or tli policy it foreshadows should be made certain. "Nothing is so mischievous to busi ness as uncertainty, nothing so paralyzing as doubt."
