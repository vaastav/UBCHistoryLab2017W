urrr HTVirnnT THTTDXTA T IB WILMINGTON, N. C. PUIO&Y. DECES1BKK 10, 1S0 Labor. We take pkusurein calling public at tention to the advertisement of Henry Nutt, General Ageut for the State of North Carolina of the North Carolina Immigra tion Association whereby we are inform ed that every necessary arrangement has been made for supplying emigrant labor of any description, and unlimited amount, upon reasonable terms, so that planters, farmers, vineyardists, mechanics and land holders, can have no cause of complaint for the want of laborers and settlers to cultivate the soil of our devastated planta tions and of the waste lands of oar coun try. Here is labor at your very doors, tendered you upon as reasonable terms as you could possibly ask. Will you accept it ? If so, then send in your orders to Mr. Nutt at onoa, and if not, complain no more of the want of labor to till your lands properly, o as to yield you the abundance which God intended them to do. In ordering emigrants two things are essential, first, get them in families. They thus have some one to talk with and en gage them at home. Their little gardens and poultry yards and other , attractions, with kind and respectful treatment, make them content and happy. This secured, they become useful and valuable, and are firmly rivited to the soil. The second es sential is, to get them as early as possible in Winter, that they may become settled and learn the manners and customs of the country, the change of diet and water and thoroughly acclimated before the approach of warm weather, that they may the bet ter be enabled to stand the warm climate during the cropping season. There is no time to lose, farmers; now i3 your oppor tunity. Seize it while you may. It will soon be too late for the approaching crop. tmOM THE DAILY J0UJ1XAL OF WEDNESDAY, 8th 1 Ttie President's Iffcssage, We were enabled to lay President Grant's first regular message before our readers yesterday morning. It is more of a review and endorsement of the opinions and reports of his Cabinet officers than recommendations of his own, a medley of the Cabinet talk and views, rather than a grave and important discussion of the principles and policies of the Government. After the usual national glorification the President directs Ins attention to the question of reconstruction, and gives the only speciQc recommendation upon any leading question contained in the mes sage. Under the pretext that the Georgia Legislature had acted in violation of tLe State Constitulion, the remedy for which might well be supposed to lie within her own control, ho recommends further legis lation before her Senators and Represen tatives arc admitted into Congress, his particular recommendation being an act authorizing the Governor to call the origi nal legislature together. The real cause of the trouble is that Georgia is under Democratic control and did not vote for General Grant for President, and her Legislature refused to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment. Congress has the power and doubtless will undo their work iu Geor gia, as recommended by their President, but we trust they will not succeed in breaking down the spirit of the people, or give such a direction to political affairs as will bring the prosperity of the State to a level with tho ruin and desolation of its eastern and western neighbors. It is a remarkable fact that now similar lands ly ing on the western bank of the Savannah are worth just ten times as much a3 those on the South Carolina side of that river, and the Chattahoochee marks the dividing line of almost as great a difference. We hope the energy and success of her citi zen's will not be forced to follow in Geor gia's political prostration. The President is emphatic iu his recom mendation that Virginia be immediately admitted into tho Union, lie thus pleases, in part, both wings of his party, each con tentiog themselves with a ' half loaf." The President thinks au early return to speoie payments to be desirable, as fluctu ations in paper value are detrimental to all interests. lint lis warns Congress that an immediate or hasty resamption would be disastrous to large classes of our citizens. It should, therefore, be gradual, but should be provided for without delay. This of course means something or nothing, calcu lated and intended to please the East and West. He recommends nothing definite ; he declares only for leading generalities. Upon the question of tho public debt he recommends a reduction of the rate of in terest, and proposes, in order to make this suggestion practicable, that Congress au thorize the interest to be paid at either three or four of the piincipal money cen tres of Europe. He has nothing definite as to tariff and internal taxes. lie thinks the rates can be reduced, but recommends the postpone ment of any general revision of the laws affecting this subject for the present, ex cept in those oases where unjust and bur densome discriminations aro made by the present laws. Ho suggests a renewal of the tax on incomes, but at a reduced rate, say three per cent., and this tax to expire in three years. Upon tho question of tho Cuban revo lution the President starts out to say nothing, and succeeds most admirably. He suggests nothing; he recommends nothing. Of course, being free ourselves, we "sympathize with all people struggling for liberty and self government," or at least President Grant says we do, and we suppose he knows. But we don't know that this assurane will do the "struggling patriots" any good. But they have the consolation of tho further belief of the President, "that in duo time Spain and other European powers will find it to their interest iu terminating these relations j and establishing their present dependent i s ' as independent powers." Yet we fear these patriots cannot wait for this time to be come due, t -1 ih sympathy and belief of General Cm ax: a ill alike bo valueless in the present "fltrugglo for freedom." The i f I t ! : breaking . -A" ! acraiust Cuba, but mentions only thoe by 'flrnc iu which Spanish vessel and officials were at fault. Ho says not a word of the detention of the steamship Cuba in our water?, unless he facetiously and covertly I refers to.it in calling attention " most es pecially" to tho Secretary of the Treasury's recommendation "for the repeal of laws allowing shares of fines, penalties, forfei ture?, &c, to officers of the Government or to informers." Whether he means this as a pleasant joke in this particular case, or intends it seriously, it should re ceive the attention of Congress. Our people, of all parties, were heartily ashamed of the swarm of harpies, in the shape of spies and informers, that flockid our streets and filled our Court room during the investigation of the cases cf the Cuban officers. It was a disgrace to the Government and a mockery of justice. The Secretary and President act wisely in directing the attention of Congress to this and similar evils resulting from this " di vision of spoils." The Alabama claims comes in for a share of the no-policy notice. The President, of course, endorses the rejection of the Johnston treaty with England, but has not seen a favorable opportunity to re-open negotiations upon this all-important sub ject. He and Minister Motley are wait ing for the auspicious moment when "something may turn up" that this "mo mentous question" can be settled "with an appreciation of what is due to the rights, dignity and power'' of both Na tions. We suppose, therefore, Congress will assist the President and his Minister to "watch and wait," and we suppose the claims will finally be settled under the statute of limitation. The President gives his views freely and fluently upon the payment of tho public debt, upon the rights of persons and pro perty of the citizens of the United States, in each and every portion of the common country, without regard to religion, color or politics, and ''the union of all tho States, with equal rights" (poor Georgia) "indestructib'e by any Constitutional means. in tne discussion of these sub jects he gets up the embellishment of the message. Ho succeeds but poorly. He takes occasion, however, in the midst ot this effort, to urge the repeal of the "Ten-ure-of-office Act," as not only uncoustitu tional but "inconsistent with a faithful and efficient administration of the Gov ernment." The fetters made to bind Presi dent Johnson now fret and chafo his suc cessor. As tho lladicul ox is now gored, the remedy will doubiies.) ba immediately applied. The treatment of the Indians and other subjects of minor importance occupy the rest of the Message. President Grant seems to have formed his message from the disjointed notes made at Cabinet meetings and after con versations with party friends. He writes as if he had attended a political feast and picked up the scrape. His Message will sureiy add nothing to his reputation as a statesman, nor will his recommendations furnish any aid to Congress in the ques tions which must receive their attention, With the exception of his bitter and ma hgnant recommendations for Georgia, we see nothing to applaud or condemn iu this nowise remarkable State paper. Tlie Liberty of the Press. We learn that Jadge Jones on Monday last directed that notice should be served upon William Biggs, Editor of of the Tarboro' Southerner, to show cause why he should not be debarred from exercising the duties and privileges of an Attorney and Counsellor in his Court. The case is to be hoard to-day at Tarboro', Judges Howard and Biggs, and W. H. Johnston, Esq., appearing for Captain Biggs. The alleged offense was not committed as an Attorney, but as an Editor, and con sisted of the publication of an article in the local columns of the Southerner, which the Judge seems to regard as offensive and disrespectful to His Honor. It is to be re gretted that J udge Jones publicly disgraced both his position and himself by exposing himself in the cars and hotel at Weldon in such a condition as to be a nuisance to his fellow-travelers and guests, and by appearing in a ttate of almost nudity in the streets of Raleigh, before he became so jealous of his official dignity and the respect due the Bench of the State. We have generally noticed that those Judges who have shown themselves officially and personally worthy of it, notwithstanding their political character and standing, have always received from the Press and the people of this State the respect due their position. If this Judge has shown his unworthiness, officially and personally, ho will find that hecannot compel respect, either by serving notices upon Attorneys, or attempting to restrain tho freedom of tho Tress. The question presented by this case is one of great importance, involving not only personal rights, but tho liberty of the Press. Since the step taken by the Su preme Court in the now famous " Con tempt case," thoir example has been aped by lesser Judges throughout the State. But none before this have gone so far as to attempt to assail the freedom of the Press. The Supreme Court assumed to punish certain attorneys, as officers of the court, for an alleged offense committed by them as such. But here Judge Jones goes out of his way to punish an attorney, whose alleged offense was committed in another and entirely different and sepa rate capacity. Ho assumes to restrain the freedom of tho Press by attempting to punish an editor in his character as an at torney of his court. We shall look for the issue with much interest, as doubtless will every citizen of North Carolina. Our people have submitted with good grace to the tyrannies and proscriptions of Con gress; they are paying the taxes assessed under corrupt and illegal legislation; they h r .. dorse, and am doing, much topro- i mote tho genera' w-;faiv, but they will re gard any infringement upon the freedom of the Press as a blow at their own free dom. They will demand that this "great bulwark of liberty" shall remain free from Uic attacks of the officers of the Govern KU, It VfUl bt a sal day for thjs. Jiber. tit?c of tho pri'!o when the Prcsa shall bo uadu subject to the control of any depart ment of tho General or State Government, by punishing their representatives as such in other relations and through other means. We shall watch this ouse with interest, and shall refer to it again. To a number of the Army anil Navy Surqeons' Medical Journal, published in Richmond during the war, Dr. William T. Wragg, of Charleston, contributed an ar ticle on the "Yellow Fever Epidemic in Wilmington in 1862," and since the. war he contributed the same article "nn abridged" to the New York Journal of Medicine. We have room for but a hasty glance at the chief points in this paper, and only introduce the subject at all as a matter of interest to those citizens who passed un scathed through the distretsiug ordeal. Dr. Wragg rir.-t describes the condition of the city, as he found it ou his arrival. He f on ! the streets and by-ways in a con dition tu favor the. spread of the epidemic pois'-u, aud general gloom and distress pervading everything. lie then produces evidence from regular and irregular physicians to show that tho fever existed auterior to the arrival of the Kate; that theso cases occurred in localities who.'.e very filthy and malarious condition was apparently sufficient to engender die ease. In the main the Doctor's evidence tends to demonstrate that the epidemio had its origin here. We read with some surprise Dr. W.'s first article, and were still more surprised at If. 3 reproduction since the war. We were, therefore, glad to see an arti cle in the December number of the New York Medical Journal, reviewing that by Dr. Wragg, from tho pen of our distin guished towusaian, Dr. W. G. Thomas. Dr. T. weighs tho evidence presented by Dr. W., and shows most conclusively, wo think, tha what appears to be strong argu ment in favor of the spontaneous origin cf the epidemic here, does not stand the test of searching investigation. Tho question of spontaneous production of yellow fever north of New Orleans, has more than onco been discussed in the medical journala,and will perhaps never be decided to the satis faction of all parties. In this case, how ever, after reading both articles careful 1 we are thoroughly convinced that Dr. Wragg was very much misinformed, and that his piper will noS go very fnr towards proving his side of the question. We call particular attention to ihe article, as a matter of speeial interest locally, but not at all in a partisan spiiit. Wo ieel we have done injustice in this hasty reference, but commend both articles to the careful attention of our readers. County Commissioners. The Board met in regular monthly session yesterday. Tho following resolution in regard to witness tickets was adopted : liesolced. That tho Clerk of this Board instruct the Treasurer of the county and the (Jlerk of the Special Court to p.iy no wknesa tickets issued bv tho Clerks of the Courts, until further orders from the Chairmau of the Finance Committee, to whooi chis subject is referred, with power to act and report to the next in ttiug of tho Board. The following order was passed : Ordered, That the accounts of the Sheriff be left to a committee of one, consisting of James Wilaon, to report to a meeting to be held Tuesday, the 10th instant. A. V. Horrell was appointed Constable of Caswell township, and John J. Beasly Constable of Masonsboro' township. Messrs. Stephen Keyes and Elijah How lett were appointed a committee to deter mine the apportionment of the school f and. J. L. Rhoades was appointed County Surveyor. The Board will continue its session to day. The above embraces the most im ¬ portant business transacted. Homicide in Brunswick. Sunday morning a colored Constable from Bruns wick brought to this city a white lad aged about 18 years, who gave hia name as Joseph Winfield Jordan Scott, and who was charged with killing a colored boy The prisoner was placed temporarily in the guard house and was yesterday morn ing taken out by his custodiaa and con veyed to Smithville for confinement in the Brunswick county jail. Tho officer was not very oommunicative, and not being able to see him in person, wehave been enabled to gain but few par ticnlais of the atlair. The name of the boy who was killed wo were unable to learn, but the killing is said to have taken place in Brunswick county a few days ago. The two boys were playing, Scott having a gun. The colored boy after a while commenced abusing Scott, who told him that if he continued to call him such names he would shoot him. On the abase being repeated, Scott raised tho gun, without any positive purpose of firing, but sure enough he did pull the trigger, the gun was discharged and the colored boy laid dead. W e give these fact as we learn them at police headquarters. Attempted Escape from the Wor.K xiuuoLj iiiiS JfcU&PUfCJ 

JPELON IS OnOT IN the Back, and His Design Frttstbated. One cf the convicts sent up from Smith ville alter the late term of the Sanerior A. Court for Brunswick county attempted to escape from the guard of the county work house luesday evening last. As ho broke and ran iu his effort to escape, one of the guard saw him, and leveled his gun and fired at the receding form. The ball took effect in the convict's back, and brought him to the grouud, preventing effectually the enort to escape. yesterday ur. J. Wmants, county physician, was summoned to attend the wounded man. He found, as stated, that the ball had entered the back of the pris oner, but ou examination it was found to be far from serious. It has, however, taught this convict and others a lesson, and attempts to escape hereafter will no doubt bo less hasty. A ball in the back is no pleasant recollection of a little adven tnre of thi3 character, and however hasti ly j jved the attempt may have been, tho M.iibm g convict is now permitted to repen. ut leisure.

Happily harmony is being rapidly restored with in our on borders; nuaafacturea hitherto un known ia our country aro shooting up in all sec tions, producing a degree of national independ ence unequalled by any other power. These blessings and countlees others are entrusted to your care and mine lor safe keeping for the brief period of our office. In a short time we must each of us return to the ranks of ibe peo ple who have conferred our honors and sccouot to them for our stewardship. I earnestly desire that neither you nor I may be condemned by the free, enlightened constituents, nor by our own consciences. Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic magnitude, as it was by sympathies and assistance from nations with which we were at peace, eleven States of the Union were four years ago left without legal State government. A natioual debt had been contracted ; American commerce was almost driven from the seas ; in dustry ia one half our of country had been taken from the control of the capitalist? and placed where al l labor rightfully belongs in keep ing of the laborer. The work of restoring State governments loyal to the Union, of protecting and fostering tree labor, of providing means for paying the inter est on the public debt, has received ample atten tion from Congress. Although your efforts have not met with the success in all particulars that might have been desired, yet on the whole they have been more successful than could have been reasonbly anticipated. Seven States which passed the ordinance of secession have been fully restored to their places in the Union. The eighth, Georgia, held an election at wtich she ratilied her constitution, republican in form, elected a governor, members of Congress, a state legislature and other officer re quired. The governor was installed, the legis lature met and performed all the acts then re quired ot them by the reconstruction acts of Congress. Subsequently, however, in violation of the constitution which tney had iust ratified, and as since decided by Supreme Court of the state, they unseated the colored members of the legislature and admitted to seats some members who are disqualified by the thir l clause of the fourteenth amendment an article which they themselves had contributed to ratify. Under these circumstances I would submit to you whether it would not be wise, without delay, to enact a law authorizing the governor of Georgia to convene the members originally elected to the legislature, required by the reconstiuction acts, and none to be admitted who are ineligible under the third clause of the lizh amendment. The lreedmen, under the protection they have received, are making rapid progress in learn ing, aud no complaints are heard of a lack of in dustry on their part when they derive lair remu neration lor their labor. The means provided for paying the interest on the public debt, with all other expenses ot the government are more than ample. The lot-s of our commerce is the only result of the late rebellion which has not re ceived sullieient attention from you. To thia subject 1 call yoar earixjsi attention. JC will not now suggost plans by which this oi'ject my oe? effected, bnt will, if necessary make it ilia subject of a special nioasage during thia ces sion of Congress. At the f ttrch term, CoKgretts by a joint reso lution, authorized the Executive t order elae tions in the Stat jh of Virginia, JIssij;eippi and Texas, to submit to the people oTiStitutions which oacii had previously framed, and submit Ihe conetirntione, either "entire, os in heparato parts, to be voted upo;i ar the. discretion of the Executive.

Among the evils growing out of the rsboliion. ana not yet marred to. is that of an in-Bdeoma- b!e currency. It is an evil which I h lye will re ceive your most earnest attention. I is a duty, and one of tea highest duties of the gctveriiment, to secure to tho citizen & medium of e schango of uxea, unvarying value, rnis implies a return to a specie basic, aud no substitute for it can be .revised, it should bo commenced now and reached at tho earnest practicable raconent; con sistent with a fair reerard to the intfirftaf, nf thn debtor class. An immediate resumption, if prac ticable, would not by deoirable. It v.'oulcl com pel tne debtor class to pay bevond sbeir con tracts a premium on sold "at the d-Ue of iheir purchase, aud would bru.g bankrup y nun ruin to thousands. Fluctuations, howev. r, in paper value, iu the mu&sare of all vantea, ctild ia detri mental to all interests. The man of bueiceas bo oomes an involuntary gambler, for in all sales when future i.avment is to be made both parties speculate as to what will bo the valine of currencv to be paid aud received. I earnest ly recommend to you, i hen, buch legislation as will insure a gradual return to upecie payments; and put an immediate stop to flactutaiona in tho value of currency. The methods to secure the former of these res u) lis are as numerous 8s speculators on political ecnuomy. To secure tjbe latter I see but. one vy, and that ia to f.uthorizti the Trea sury to rf.-dsem i's own paper at a fixed price wheuev.-r presHntod, and to withhold from circu lation all currency sc redeemed until sold Bgain for gold. The vast resources of the rtation, ooth developed and undeveloped, ought to make our credit the buefc on earth, with him bmrcen and taxation than that which the citifjeu h.8 endured for six j-'mm past, the eotire public debt could bs paid in ten y.rw. But i& i8 noic desirable tbat the nvopie fSiould be t?.x.el to pav it in that time. Year by year our ability to pay increases in rnpio rati;; but, tie burden ot'intac-eat ought to );. i sdnced s rapi'j: as can t.e dqc:ie without the violati ju of oonl: act. The public debt is represented in great part by bonds having from five (5) to twerrty (20) and from ten (10) to forty (40) years to ntn, bearing interest at the rate of six. (fi) and five C 5) per cent, respectively. It is optional with the gov ernment to pay these bonds at any period after expiration ; the least time mentioned upon their iau. inu iime uas already expired when the gicat pari may oe uiKcn up, and ra pidly ap proaching when all may be. n ia ucnevett :uat all which arc now due may be replaced by bouds bearing a rate of interest not exceeaiog lour nod a half per cent,. . and aa rapidly as the remainder becomes due that they niay be rep!acod in eomo way. To ace omplieh this it may be necesaarv to unthnno ini 4 be paid at either three or four of the money cen tera ot Europe, or by any assistaut treasurer of the Lmted States, at the option of the holder of tne oonus. i suggest this sub eet for the nnnaM erauon ot Lorjgrcss. and alnn amuilt.anA. oueiy witn tins the propriety of redeeming our currency as before Rn"frfi market value at the time thn i effect, increasing thd rate at which currercv w'll be bought aud sold from day to dAy, or week to wceu. at m aame rate or interest aa the govern ment paya upon ita bond?.

The office of Commiaeioaer of Internal Reven ue is one of the most arduous and responsible under the government. It falls little short of a Cabinet position in its importance and responsi bilities. I would ask for it, therefore, such legis lation as in your judgment will place the oliica upon the footing of dignity commensurate with ita importance, and with a character and qualifi cations of the class of men required to fill it properly. As the United States is tha freest of all nations, 8? too its pood'.o sympathize with nil people struggling for liberty and self-go vt-rnmeot. But while so sympathizing it ia duo to our honor that we should abstain from enforcing our views upon unwilling cations and from tasing an in terested part without invitation in quarrels be tween different n&tiona or between governments and their subjects. Ouc course should always be in conformity with strict justice and law, in ternational and local, ttnch has been the policy of the Administration in dealing with these questions. For more than a year a valuablo province of Spain and a near neighbor of ours, in whom all our people cannot but feel a deep interest, has been struggling for independence aud freedom. Ths peop'o and government of the United States entertain the sam warm feel ings and sympathies for the people of Cuba, in their psnding etruggio, than they manifested throughout the previous etrnggles between Spain and her former ccloniea in behalf of the latter, but tho contest has at no tini9 assumed conditions which amount to war in tho eoneo ot international law, or which would show tha ex istence of a de facto political organization of in surgents sufficient to justify a. recognition of belligerency. Tne principle Id maintained, however, that this nation is its own judge when to accord rights of belligerBcy either to a people strug gling to free themselvea from a govammc-nt they believe to be oppressive or to mdependf- nt na tions at war with each other. The United States has no disposition to intetfere with tha existing relations of Spain to her colonial possessions ou thia coctinent. They Lclievo that in due time Spain and other 3'Jnropeau powers will find it to their interest in terminating thoso relations and establishing their present dependencies as inde pendent powers. Theso dependencies are no longer regarded &a fiubj-ci; to tr&nefer from on European power to another. When the present relation of colonies ceaeea they are to become indepenaout power.-, exercising tho right of choice and of self-control in the deterrainariou of their future condition and i elations with oilier powers. The United States, ia order to put a fcto-; to bloodshed in Cuba, and in the inte rnet of neighboring i.eopio. proffered its good officer to bring tho exiatiag contest to a termination. The offer not beice accepted by Spain, on the basid wbicb we bei;eve couUl be received by Cab wan withdrawn. U is hoped that 'lie o rji ,.f- lice3 of the V! niter: States miy yet prove advan tageous for the KO'jlemen'uOfthis unhappy strife. In the mcauAvhiic a number of illegal expedi tions against Cubs havo been broken up. It has been the endeavor of the Administration to exe cute the neutrality laws no matter how unpleas ant the task ,nride so by the suffering we have en dured from the lack of like good faith towards us by other nations. On the J6th of March last, the U.

This proclamation, however, was immtdiatelv withdrawn. I hive always felt th&t th- irost intima rela tion should be cultivate! hetweeu the United Htatei and independe nt mti-Kn on this continent. Is mi y ba well worth considering whether new treatie i between tu a id ilirm may not be profit ably entered into t. m eu more intimate rela tions, friendly, commercial and otherwise. Inter-oceanic canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Isthmus of Da rien is one in which commerce is greatly inter ested. Instruct ions have been given to the min ister of the United States to Colombia to endeav or to obtain authority for a survey to determine the practicability wf the undertaking. In order to comply with the agreement of the United States as to a mixed commission at Lima for the adjustment of claims it became necessary to send a Comoiissioner and Secretary to Lima. The good offices of the United States to bring about peace between Spain and South American Republics having been accepted by Spain, Peru and Chili, a Congress has been invited to be held in Washington during the present Winter. A grant uas been given to Europeans of an exclusive right of transit over the territory of Nicaragua, to which Costa Kica has given its assent-, which it is alleged conflicts with the ves ted rights of citizens of the United Statee. The Department of State has now this subject under consideration. .The Minister of Peru having made representa tion that there was a state of war between Pern and Spain, and that Spain was constructing in and near New York thirty gunboats which might be used by Spain to relieve her naval force at Cuba to operate against Pern. Orders were given to prevent their departure. No further etepe having been taken by the representatives of the Peruvian government to prevent the depart ure of these vessels and I cot feeling authorized to detain property of a nation, with which wo are at peace, on mere executive orders, the matter has neen referred to the courts. The conduct of Paraguay hss made intercourse with that country difficult, It has been deemed advisable to withdraw our representatives from there. Toward a the close of the last administration a convention was signed at London for the set tlement of outstanding claims between Great Britain and the United states, which failed to re ceive advice ana consent ot the Senate. Time and circumstances attending tho negotiation of that treaty were unfavorable to its acceptance by the people of the United States, audits piovisions were vjhoily inadequate for the settlement of the grave wrongs sustained by this government. In juries resulting to this guvnrnment by reason of the course adopted by Great Britain during the war ; in increased rates of insurance ; ia diminu eion of exports and imports, and other obstruc tions to domestic industry and production ; in its effect upon the foreign commerce of tho country ; in decrease and transfer to Great Bri.lain of our commercial marine ; in tho prolongation of the war and increased cost, both in treasure and in lives; of its suppression, could not bo ad justed and satisfied as ordinary commer cial claims which continually arise be tween commercial nations. And yet the Con vention treated them simply as such ordinary claims from which they differ more widely in the gravity ot their character than in the magnitude of their amount. Great even as is that differ ence, not one word was found in the treaty and not an inference could be drawn from it, to re move the sense of unfriendliness of the course oi Great Britain in our struggle for existence, whieu had so deeply and universally impressed itscit upon the people ot that country. Believing that a convention thus mis conceived m its scope and inadequate ia its provisions, would not have produced the hearty and cordial settlement of the pending questions, wmcn aione is consistent witn the relatione which I desire to have firmly established between the united btates and Great Britain. I regarded ine action oi tne nenace in rejecting the treaty to have been wisely taken, in the" interest ot peace aud as a necessary step m the direction of a perfect and cordial friendship between the two countries. A sensitive people, conscious ol their power, are more at ease under a great wrong wholly unatoned than under the restraint of a settlement which satisfies neither their ideab of justice nor their grave sense of the grievance they have sustained, the rejection of tho treatj was allowed by a stato of public feelinar on both sides, which I thought was not favorable to an immediate attempt at renewed negotiations. accordingly so instructed the minuter ofth United States to Great Britain and found that my views in this regaid were shared bv her aiajestiofs' Ministers. I hooo that " th time may soon arriye when the two Governments can approach lh9 solution o this momentous question with an aDme -ii-i r t of what is dao to the rights, dignity and -,iv i v of each, and with the determination not ouiy to remove the causes ot complaint in the Datt. but to lay the foundation of a broad principlo of pub- i... i . ...I....;. ,..,.,, .... i' i .iu . tena to firm and continuod pewa and friendship. u jaw u.wu m.i uicvoui. luiiuio uuierencea inn , Thia i now th; only gra-c question which tLe Umtod States ima witii ny Foreign nations. The question of reucv.-mg the treaty for reciprocal trade between the United States and the Britieh Provinces onthw (Continent hava not been favoi ably considered, iu conformity with the recom nietidation of Congress. A proposition to abolish mixed courts for the 8G)j,j.-3sion of til slave trade is under negotia tion. It having come to my knowledge that a coipo rate company organized ucd. r Biitisti laws pro posed to land upon tho shores of t he United etatea and to operate there n, eubm irine cablo under a concession from the French Emperor of an exclu sive right for twenty years of telegraphic commu nication between the shores of Franco and th9 United States, with tho very objec tionable feature of subjecting all mes sages conveyed thereby to the scrutiny and control cf the French government, I caused the French and British legations at Washington to bo made acquainted with tho probable policy of Congress on this subject as loreshadowed by the bill which was adopted by tho Senate in March. Thia drew from the representatives of tho com pany an agreement to accept as the basis of thia operation the provisions of the bill or such oher enactment on the eubiect asmuhtbo passed dur- insr the aDDroachiRg session of Congress; also to use their influence to eocure from tho French gov't the modification of their concession to permit the landing of any cable belonging to any company or corporation by authority ot tne unitea States or anv State in the Union, and on their part not to oppose the establishment of any such cable. Iu consideration of this agreement I directed the withdrawal of all opposition by the United States to the landing of the cable until the mectiKg of Congress. I regret to say that there has been no modification made in the company's concession, nor so tar as I can learn have they attempted to secure one. Their con cessions exclude the capital and citizens ol' the United States from competition upon the shores of Franco. I recommend legislation to protest the righis of citizens of the United States and Sovereign nations against such au assumption. I shall also endeavor to secure by negotiation an abandonment of the principle of monop olies in the ocean telegraphic cables. The unsettled political condition of other countries, less fortunate than our owu, some times induces their citizens to come to the United States for the sole purpose of becoming naturalized. Having secured this they return to their native country and reside there without disclosing their change of allegiance; the' ac cept official positions ot honor or trust which can only be held by citizens of their native lauds; they journey under passports describing them as such citizens, and it is only when civil discord lifter perhaps years of quiet threaten their person or their property ; or when their native state drafts them into its military service that ! their change of allegiance is known. They reside permanently away lrom the United States ; con tribute uothing to its revenues ; avoid duties of citizenship, and only make themselves known by a claim of protection. I have directed thcdiplo matic and consular officers to scrutinize carefully all Bach claims of protection. Any citizen of the Unted States, whether native or adopted, who discharges hid duty to hisjcouatry, ia entitled to iti complete protection, vhilo I have a voice in tho direction of nffairs, I shall not consent to imperil 3iin acrcd right by conferring it upon fictitious or fraudulent claimants.

With tLe improvements iu machinery already effected and still incroasing, cacsing machinery to tako the place of skilled labor to a large extent, our imports oi many ar ticles must fall off largely within a very fow years. Fortunately, too, manufactures aro not confined to a few localities as formerly, a id it is to bo hoped that they will become more and more dif fused, making the interest in them equal in all sections. Thoy give employment and support to hui ireua of thousands of p.iople at homy, and re tain with us tho mean j which otherwise would bo s mured abroad. The extension cf tho railroads in Europe aud the East, ia bringing into competition with our agricultural products liko products of other countries. elf-interest, it not eelf-preservation, therefore, dictates caution against d sturbmg any indnstral interest of the country. It teaches us, aiso, the necessity cf looking to other markets foigthe sale of our surplus. Our neighbors south of ua and China and Japan auould recoive our speck! attention. It 'wiil bo tho endeaver cf tho Administration to cultivate such relations with all these nations as to entitle us to their confidence, and make it to their inter est as well as (-nre to o-.tnbli.sh better commer cial relations Through tho agency of a more enlightened policy than that heretofore pursued toward Chi nalargely duo to the sagacity and efforts of one or cur era distinguished citizens the world ia about to commence largely increased relations with the populous and hitherto exclusive nation. As the United ttates have been tho initiators in this new policy, so they should be the most earn est in showing their good faith iu making it a suc cess. In this connection, I adviso such legislation as will forever preclude tho enslavement of the Chi nese upon our soil, under the namo of Coolies, and also prevent American vessels from engaging in the transportation of Coolies to any country tolerating the system. I also recommend that the mission to China be raised to one of tha first- class. On my assuming the responsible duties of chief magistrate of tho United State, it was with the conviction that threo things were essen tial to its peace, prosperity and fullest develop ment. First among these is strict integrity in fulfilling all our obligations; second, to secure protection to the person and property of tho cit zena of the Unitod States, ia each and every por- all the states, with eoual riffhts. inrlnntmAtihlA by any constitutional ines,us. To secure the first of theso Congress has taken twoeseential steps; first, in declaring by joint reeolution that the public debt shall be paid, principal and inter est, in coin; and second by providing the means for paying. I'roviding the means, however, could not secure the object desired without a proper auciinistratinu of the laws for the collec tion of the revenues and an economical dis bursement of them. To this subject the Admin istration ha moat earnestlv addressed itself wuu results, .mope, satisfactory to the country. There has been no hesitation in changing offici als in ordtr to securo an efficient execution of the laws, sometimes toe, viiere, in a mere party view, undesirable political results were likely to follow, nor any hcaitati-iu in retaining efficient officials against remonstrances wholly political. It may bo well to mention here the embar rasement possible to arise from leaving on the statute books thee j-calied "tenure-of-effice acts," and to earnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution, when providing that appointments made by the President should re ceivo the coneeot cf the Benate ; that the latter should have t!ie power toretaiu in office persons placed thei 3 by Federal appointments, against the vvili -it the President. The law is incon sistent v,-i:h a faithful and efficient adminis tration of tho government. What faith can an Executive put in officials forced upon him, and those, too, whom he has suspended for reason. How will such officials be likely to serve an administration which they know does not trust them ? ortuo becoud requisite to our growth and prosperity, time and u fimi but humane admin istration ol existing laws, amended from time to time a3 they may be ineffective or prove harsh and unnecessary, are probably all that arc re quired. The third cannot be attained by special lcis- iawou, out, must oe regarded as fixed by the constitution itself, and gradually acquiesced ip iuicu oi puoiic opinion.
