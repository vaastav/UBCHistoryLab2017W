One wonld think from the tenacity with which he ohnga to office that he was an American politician of the liepubhoan persuasion. HENDSTOKS reiterates his previous state ment that ho won't play second fiddle to anybody in the next Presidential ooutest We are not aware of the fact of Mr. Hen dricks being asked to take any place, first or second, and his declination, therefore, conies vary inopportune. THE Louisville Courier'Journal fairly gushes ovei Grant's visit to that city, and squanders twenty long columns of space to describe the rooeption. For a paper that has hitherto objected strenuonsly to toady ism, we are of opinion that the Oourier Journal has somewhat o'erleaped itself. WATTEKSON and Hewitt are still quarrel ing in public. It would be an accommoda tion to the people generally if they wonld keep their grievances to themselves or adopt the policy of the patrons of the prize ring and betako theoibelves to some secluded spot where they can fight the quarrel out without annoying the rest of the world. SOME citizens of St. Paul have of Jut pionounotd favor of choking off railroad enterprises on the ground of the offense given by the locomotive whistles. Perhaps it would be as well to suggest that steam boats be inteidicfced from the privilege of approaching our leveo, and at the same time Tequtreall wagons that entei the city to Lavi their wheels rxmfllad. It business is to b killed it is well do the business thoroughly A to forbid employes of the govern ment from contributing to political fund' has been made the special order in the House for January 7. It is a bill that ought to pass. Ihe system of political assessments or contributions is nothing more or less than a speoies of blackmail, and should be pro hibited by law, no matter what party is in power. Both Republicans and Democrats ought to be anxious to secure the enactment of suoh a proper law. IT is Mr. McDonald's opinion that Mr Voorhees will not press his resolution an iagonizing Mr. Bayard's anti-legal tender bill to passage, but that ho will be content with making a speech in its favor, and then permit it to Bleep in the committee. This will be a wise oourse. Mr. Bayard's bill has no chance of passage, and therefore Mr. Voorhees' resolution is unnecessary. Both schemes are better buried, and both will, without doubt, meet a like fate. B. HAYES, not content with tiying to dis credit tho legil tender currency of the coun try through his message to Congress, has written and procured to be printed a letter to a friend, in which he says: You want money to be plenty, the rate of in terest to ho low at the same time yoa want the money to be good. (1) You can only have this state of things when there is confidence in the stability of ttie currency (2) Capital will not go where it is uncertain in what ourrenoy debts will be paid next month or nest year. (8) If the legal tender for debts depends on tho un certain action of Congress there will be a want of confidence. (4) The only constitutional le gal tender is gold and silver. Depart from that and confidence is gone. All the world now be lieves that investments ia America are likely to be profitable. A sound financial polioy will bring us money from all the commercial na tions of the earth. These propositions are cheap, and they prove nothing. The legal tender notes do not depend npon any uncertain aotion of Congress for their currency. They are based on a far broader standardthe faith of the nation. When it becomes manifest that the country is neither able nor willing to fulfill its obligations, the value of the ourrenoy will depreciate, but on no other account, Mr. Hayes to the contrary notwith standing. KILLING A CONVICT. About a year ago the GLOBE exposed the treatment accorded to prisoners in the peni tentiary at Stillwater and called for reform. Almost all the charges were made against Deputy Warden Hall, and, according to the statement of prisoners, he was brutal in the extreme. The Legislature indulged in a sort of half-hearted investigation. No prisoners were allowed to testify, and only witnesses favorable to the prison ring were put npon the stand. The result was a coit of thin whitewash, and the admirers of Hall pro ceeded to present him with a gold-headed cane. It is not surprising that after being ac quitted of and lionized for brutality, the deputy warden should feel encouraged to take almost any latitnde. The murder of a convict Thursday night can be directly traced to the gold-headed cane presentation, which Mr. Hall evidently considered as an endorsement in full for past offenses, and immunity for the future. The coroner's jury has not completed its work at this writing, but their investigation thus far has revealed no new facts not cov ered by the report in yesterday's GLOBE. The general verdict will be that the deputy warden exceeded tho necessities of the case and exercised his power in an unnecessarily harsh and brutal manner. There is, how ever considerable to be said in his behalf. The department of the prison where Clark was at work contains nearly all of the life prisoners. The Younger brotheis and all of the worst desperadoes are gathered in that department, and a lit tle weakness displayed toward a re bellious prisoner might, result fatally. Here are some two or three hundred men, the large majority desperate characters They have knives, hatchets, hammers, chis els and numerous other implements in the work shops which would become formidable weapons in case of a revolt. There is, more over, a constant incentive to 'an outbreak from the fact that the prison is largely sur rounded by a board fence, and only that weak and easily destroyed fence stands between these convicts and their liberty. Under such circumstances discipline is of vital importance, and the prisoners must feel that $hey have deter mined, resolute men to deal with, or the handful of guards could do nothing in keep ing them in subjection. Primarily the State itself is to blame for the Thursday night murder, as it is hardly likely that even Hall would have gone to suoh an extreme, if the prisoners were held within the boundaries of a stone wall and there was no opportunity of their escaping, oven by re volt. If a shot was neoessary at all, it might havo been made to wound instead of to kill. The refractory prisoner could un doubtedly have been clubbed into submission without danger to anyone. So far as the life of this prisoner is con cerned, there is, probably, no loss to lament? but the principle involved is of vital import ance. Neither law or humanity will justify prison keepers in shooting down their prisoners, unless a desperate exigenoy arises. When all that can be said in Hall's behalf is uttered (and we grant there is a good deal), his conduct cannot be justified. It was undoubtedly necessary to demonstrate that the prison discipline would brook no mutiny, but this could have been shown without committing murder. The act was evidently hasty and the result of apprehension that a revolt might ensue if a prisoner was allowed to defy authority. Clark deserved punishment but he did not (for that act) deserve death. The whole affair is a vindication and con firmation of the strictures of the GLOBE over a year ago. If a little more heed had been paid to the counsels then given, and less attention devoted to gold-headed testimonial canes, the record of to-day would not have to be made. The Srate authorities are placed in an embarrassing position. If they proceed to punish Hall by a discharge, it ie a notice to two or three hundred desperadoes that their keepers are not allowed to shoot, and the in centive to make a break for the weak board fence is increased. The illy protected prison places them in a dilemma, where they can hardly follow tho dictate? which must nat urally be uppermost in such an emergency. RAILROAD TAXATION. The announcement is made that for the coming year no State tax will be imposed in Nc*v Jersey. It appears from the report of oho oomptioller oi the State that the special tax on railroads and the invested funds will ifford a revenue snffioient to pay all the ex penses of the government and have a sur plus of considerable dimensions. The case is an exceptional one, and the instance is, if recollection serves aright, the first of the kind on record. It is the result of a system of taxation that has been introduced, we be lieve, into but three StatesNew Jersey Illinois and Minnesotabut in Illinois only partially. It is the imposition of a tax upon the earnings of the railroads instead of upon their property. Twelve years ago the debt of New Jersey amounted to about twenty millions of dol lars. The State was under the dominion of the Camden & Amboy railroad company] and was referred to more generally as the State of Camden & Amboy than its proper spoliation. About that time, however, the legislature took aotion on the railroad ques tion, and a tax was imposed upon the earn* ings of the railroads, partly at railroad dictation and partly because the people had become weary of supporting the monopolies at public expense. The railroads accepted the per osntage tax in the belief that it would be less onerous than the property tax, and the people generally aocepted it as the easiest way out of a bad dilemma. The re sult has proved that the railroads have paid much more into the public treasury than they would have done under the old system, though they have not been unjustly assessed. As one of the consequences we find that the State debt has been extinguished, and the governor will be enabled to make the an nouncement in his next annual message that no State taxes need be imposed. In Illinois the same system has been in vogue as far as one companythe Illinois Centralis concerned. The property of that oompany is exempt from local or State taxation, but a tax of two per cent, is im posed upon the gross earnings of the com pany. It is obeerfully paid and out of the fund created by this tax the entire State debt has been extinguished, the last dollar having been paid last week. In Minnesota the same system is in vogue in a modified form, but eventually it will re sult in the imposition of a stated tax on the earnings of all the railroads doing business in the State. We are not apprised as to how faithfully the tax has been collected heretofore, but presume it has been properly enforced. But the institution of the system is something for which the people have rea son to be thankful. It gives a promise of the final extinguishment not only of our State debt but of our State taxation, and if the funds are properly managed we can look forward to the day when Minnesota will be one of the best States in the Union as far as taxation is concerned. Defective Sidewalks. To the Editor of the Globe. S T. 

PAUL, Dec. 10.For some time prop erty owners around the Seven Corners bave been annoyed by the city authorities, on ac count of defective sidewalks, and have had them repaired under compulsion. So far, so good. The corner of Third and St. Peter streets is nothing less than a man trap, and if the street commissioners would only look at this public nuisance and report the same to the proper officials, the city may be saved tho expense and damages arising from law suits. Any of your readers can satisfy him or herself by examining th9 premises. SEVEN CORNEBS. Hough's Christmas Goods. Will be opened to-day.

'"i -^^"r1*^ #.vss p*^wta!iig*^K.-a^sp-Mi)'iaw[i-jA THE ANDERSON SU^T. i Second Dayof the Aotion Against the First National BankThe Plaintiff Rests and tho Court Denies a Motion to Dismiss. The trial of the Anderson case, or, more properly, his oase against Horaoe Thompson, was resumed, yesterday, in the United States circuit court. The examination of Air. H. P. Upham, cashier^of the First National bank, was con tinued, fie, with the bank books, assisted in their explanation by J. M. Vander. hoof, occupied the time of the court from 10 o'clock A. AI. to I o'clock p. si with an interval for the bleBsed hour of dinner. Besides the bank books, the firm books of Strong & Anderson were also intro duced for explanation, Mr. B. B. Baker, former bookkeeper of the firm, and Mr. Gillett, book keeper for W. L. Anderson, acting as the human index for the last named books. Thus tho novel sight waa presented of four witnesses on the stand at the name time with the si-mul-ta-ne-ous exhibition of two sets of boobs, all in one case. Mr. Upham acted as spokesman for the oth ers, mostly, with here and there an explanatory utterance by Mr. Baker from the pages of the Strong & Anderson books. The examination WSB in every sense a continuance of that of the previous day. In other words, B. O. Strong Co.'s aocount with the First National bank was followed from the time of forming the partnership of Stroxig & Anderson up to its elimination on tho books of the bank. Item by item this tedions course was pur sued, and the whole business can be summarized in the statement, that like the instance mentioned as having ocouri ed in March, 1872, others were found, where notes of R. O. Str mg & Co. had been paid by checks drawn against Stroner & Anderson's account. Without specifying instances, the Bum of thin kind of transaction was proved to reach the figures of $3,500, at least. Following Mr. Upham, the namo of B. O. Strong was called. He took the stand, but to the disappointment of the many in attendance was let off with one question, the answer in dicating what it was: "I made a formal set tlement with my former partner by buying him out, in April of 1871." With this Mr. Strong gave way for Horace Thompson. Here again the audience were doomed to dis appointment. He was let off, after saying his bank was the banker of Strong & Co, or Rich ardso'n, and that he didn't remember anything about when Stiong and Richardson had made a settlement. He only knew Richardson with drew, and that's all. Mr. Gillett was re-called. He said he was bookkeeper of Strong & Anderson in Mav of 1873. He was next asked if he remembered about that time that Strong had made a cash sale and that he had not caused it to be entered on the books. Judge Flandrau objected, as it wasn't mate rial or relevant. Mr. Pierce contended it was. The defense relied on Strong's books in this matter, and he wanted to show they had not been kept cor rectly, but with the intent to cheat. Further more, it had been shown that Strong had made caBh deposits to take up bis notes in Thomp son's bank. He wanted to show that this cash deposited had been gotten from sales, which were never accounted for. The court h?ld that the question should not be put, as the plaintiff had failed to join Strong and the First National bank in a conspiracy to defraud. The action was against the bank alone. Exception noted. Mr. Gillett closed his testimony with the as sertion that Anderson knew nothing about bookkeeping and he was a salesman in the store, and Strong, in addition to being a .sales man, had a general control of the business. The plaintiff rested his case, and no sooner had ''the rest" been announced than Judge Flandrau was prompt with a motion to dismiss the oase. He veiy briefly contended that the plaintiff had made no oase. He had taken his case out of court on the statute ef limitation ho had shown that both partners in the firm of Strong & Anderson had checked against the firm's funds to pay private debts. And this being agreed by this action, if nothing more, barred him from remedy. Third, The settlement of Anderson with Strong, when the dissolution of the firm took place turther barred him from remedy. He had lost nothing moreover by the transaction, as all Strong's payments with Strong & Ander son's funds were charged against Strong on the firm's books. Mr. Pierce replied at some length. In con nection with the interposition of the statute of limitation as a bar to trial, ho read the State statute on the subject, and then proceeded to show what tbe statute meant by the word fraud used therein. He contended that fraud was charged, whether from design or not, it was fraud in law,'and as such the case waa triable under the statute. It was, too, such a fraud that the plaintiff was kept from it, or the date of its happening, until six years after it happened. And that under the oircomstances the Btatute applied only to tho time of the discovery of the fraud, and therefore th* case was net barred. Mr. Pieree further cted that the bank had admit ted Strong's indebtedness, and the books had shown that Anderson ii Strong's money had gone to pay Strong's debts, whether accepted by defendant, with the design to defraud, did not matter. The mere fact of its acceptance, the bank being banker for both parties, con stituted legal fraud, as contemplated in the statute. Mr. Pierce further contended that the case should not be dismissed, and cited from the authorities at length and voluminously to sustain him. The court said that there seemed testi mony enough adduced to have the case go to the jury, and it wasn't a mere scintilla either, but evidence to show that the funds of Strong & Anderson had been diverted to the payment of Strong's, or Strong & Oo.'s, in debtedness. Under this phase of the case, the court thought it should go to the jury, unless it could be shown that the Btatute of limita tion was a bar. The court then reviewed #jhe practice ob taining in State courts regarding the statute of limitation, and if it was interpreted to mean that it applied six years after the discovery, and not the commission of the fraud, he felt inclined to think the same would hold good in federal courts, either in cases of law or in equity. In alluding to the charge of fraud the court remarked that this feature must be considered that it waa complained that defendant had concealed the course of action. In thiB con nection the court denned the duties of banks as between partners, as individuals and as a firm. If firm funds were received in payment of partners debts it was legal fraud unless an understanding, etc., we*e had between the bank and the firm as individuals, but if cus tom made it otherwise this wonld not hold good. Ordinarily such was the case, and in this case he thought the plea of the statute might be entertained, but in view of the fact that there was evidence pertinent to the cause at lBsae submitted he didn't feel inclined to take the case from the jury, and therefore wonld deny the motion to dismiss. The hour of 5:30 o'clock p. M. being marked up on the face of time in full view, the court adjourned until 10 o'clock A. M. to-day. LIFE IN LEADVILLE. Ihe Sheriff of that Delightful Region In St. Paul. Mr. Andrew J. Wampler, the druggist, ia entertaining an old friend and renewing many pleasant memories, in the person of Mr. L. Tucker. Mr. Tnoker is from Leadville, Colorado, and is sheriff of that far-away frontier community. It's a po sition, judging from the iate ac counts of hanging and shooting bees at Leadville, which will try a man's soul as well as test his body in resisting the impact of leaden bullets. How ever, Mr. Tucker looks equal to the emergen cy of discharging his office even in an un ruly country. The rows and vigilance com mittee's aotion have all taken place since Mr. Tnoker left Leadville for a visit to his former home in Indiana, but he says he saw Symptoms before his departure. The GLOBE enjoyed a few moments talk with Mr. Tucker and was told considerable about the new town and tbe wealth acquired there as if by magic. Two years and a half ago, silver in paying leads was discovered there. Since then a town has grown to the' pro portions of 20,000 inhabitants. The first discoveries led to others, and created a wild excitement. Speculation, but always based on solid ulver veins, as it were, be came rife and gave many immense fortunes. Hon. H. A. W. Taber, lieutenant governor of Colorado, was worth $30,000 two years ago, and he's the bonanza king of Leadvilb) to- 'IIJJSJ^^^&^SWJA Z$^SfrM THE SAINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE, SATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 13, 1879. day, with wealth estimated at 910,000,000. As a sign of Leadville's lasting prospects, Mr. Tucker says that not a single mine has been worked out, and prospecting discovers more extensive and richerveins right along. Mr. Tucker knew of Archie MoLeod, but wasn't personally acquainted with him. The Hutchinson family of singers he knew, and they were*doing fairly out there. As to the hurrah character' ascribed to Leadville, Mr. Tnoker said until recently Leadville had been noticed for an absence of outlaw con duct, as usual in frontier mining towns, especially. On the whole, Leadville is de scribed aa a good place to emigrate to with money and not thoroughly a bad place to settle in,if a man is determined to work for a livelihood. COLONEL DOWNIB. Sketch of the Life of a Gallant Officer. The GLOBE has duly recorded the death of Col. Mark W. Downie, which occurred in Florida last month. The Florida Mirror, published at Fernandina, gives the following very interesting sketch of this gallant offi cer: We bave already noticed the death of our fellow-citizen, Colonel Downie. in what seemed to ns appropriate terms of respect and there was*added, also, the brief tribute of%n old friend to a gallant soldier, who bad died in tbe faith and penitence of a humble Christian. Some facts have since been placed at our disposal, the recital of which may possess interest not only for the im mediate friends of the deceased, but for many others, as pertaining to those feats of daring and deeds of gentleness whioh char acterized the great war that closed in the year 1865. Colonel Mark W. Downie was born March 15th, 1836, at Chatham, in the province of New Brunswick, and removing to Minnesota at the age of nineteen, was at once actively and successfully engaged in business. The breaking out of the war found him cashier of a bank at Stillwater. On enrolling him self as a volunteer, he was chosen captain of the Stillwater Guards, and by successive promotion** became major, lieutenant colo nel, and colonel, of the First Minnesota regiment. His career during the war was signalized by dauntless resolution and con rage. The prompt energy of his character will be recognized in suoh incidents as the following: While the series of hard-fought engage, ments near Richmond was still in progress, at a time when it seemed impossible for Gen. McClellan to extricate his army, his retreat having been cut off by Gen. Lee, it became neoessary, as a means of escape, to construct a bridge across the Chickahominy in a single day. The United States engineers reported that it could not be done. Gen. Sully sent for Major Downie, who waa lying in his tent prostrated by fever. The reply was promptly given: "General, find me* a thousand lum bermen from the Northwest, and the bridge shall be built." The task was performed ac cording to promise, but for two months the builder was confined by a wasting fever to a hospital in New Haven, to whioh he was carried immediately after the bridge was finished. At Atlanta, last summer, a United States officer, on hearing Ccl. Downie's name men tioned, said of him: "Mark Downie was the bravest soldier in the army." Gapt. MoGill, a Southerner, replied: "Well, he was surely the kindest." He then related an occurrence which took place shortly after the battle of Fredericksburg, the town beibg held for a time by the Union forces. The ladies had entreated permission of the officer in oom mand to take the Confederate wounded to their homes their request was sternly re fused. Col. Downie arriving at this junc ture with his regiment, as superior in rank, took command of the place and revoking the refusal directed his men to prepare -stretchers for the wounded, and in every way render thorn assistance and pro vide for their comfort. Capt. McGill found himself a prisoner, but seeing tbe sympathy for the suffering manifested by his enemy, he boldly stepped forward and announced himself a confederate surgeon, and begged to be released that he might attend upon the wounded soldiers. Ccl. Downie immediate ly ordered his release. This confederate captain (not a surgeon) was a bearer of dis patches from Stonewall Jackson to Gen. Lee, and reported the faota to Gen. -Lee, whose words of praise are treasured up alike by friend and foe. The confederate com mander-in-chief said: "Col. Downie is a soldier and a gentleman send his name and regiment to the adjutant-general's office in Richmond, and if he is ever taken prisoner let him be released at once on parole." The ladies of Virginia showed their appreciation of this kindness to their friends at Fred ericksburg by hospitable attentions to the First Minnesota, as that regiment passed through after the war, and subsequently by letters of thanks to its commanding officer. A manly foe must admire traits of gener osity, whether displayed in peace or war. During his residenoe in Florida, Col. Downie showed his friendship and sympathy for the poor and suffering,' and particularly at the time when the yellow fever prevailed at Ce dar Key in 1871. He went there "to nurse the sick, feed the poor and bury the dead he expended his strength and his money on their behalf, and the result of his six weeks' incessant labor was a very severe illness, from whioh he never fully reoovered. Such is an unadorned narrative of charac teristic events selected and set down as fitting words to be recorded concerning one whose last painful and protracted illness, soothed by the unceasing ministrations of affeotion, was borne with fortitude and with resigna tion whose faults, frankly acknowledged by himself, were those of a warm, impulsive na ture, and of whosd virtues this short chroni cle of detached incidents may aid in preserv ing the recollection. TB.E ARMT.. The Latest Orders Issued from Wash ington. The following are the latest orders, of inter est affecting the army, from Washington: The extension of leave of absence granted George L.

Referred. The bill provides for tbe appointment by the President of a commission to consist of five members to be selected, one from the navy, one from the army, one from the coast survey and two from civil life. The first three named are to serve without extra compensation, and the two latter to receive $500 per month. The commission shall be called the "Iater-Oeeanio commisaion." OBEKKBACKS. Mr. Gillette introdnced a bill in opposition to retirement of greenbacks, and in favor of substituting them for the national banks, and for the free ceinsge of silver. Referred. SVOAB TABTFT. Mr. Morton presented a memorial of the sugar importers and refiners praying for an early consideration and revision of the sugar tariff. PASSED. The fortification and pension appropriation bills were passed and private bills taken up. The bill passed authorizing the^assistant treasurer of the United States at New York to waive the enforcement of section 3477 revised statutes, so far as the same effects oertain drafts on him now held by the Masonic bank of Pittsburgh. THE UTE'S BEMOVAL. The Senate joint resolution authorizing the secretary of the interior to negotiate with the Ute Indians for relinquishment of their reser vation in Colorado, was taken from the Speak er's table and referred to the committee on Indian affairs. THE FOBTrriCATIOW BILL. Mr. Baker, from tbe committee on Indian affairs, reported back from the fortification ap priatiou bill, and the Hout,e went into commit tee of the whole, Mr. Converse in the chair, upon that bill. The Speaker proceeded to ex plain the provisions of the bill. With one Bingle exception, the bill was the same that had been reported for the last two years. The item for the armament of coast fortifications, includ ing heavy guns and howitzers, powder, etc., had been increased by the sum of $100,000, so that item of the present bill amounted to $235,060, in place of $125,000 last year. The estimate of the chief of ordnanoe for that service had been $1,067,000. The secretary of war had reduced that estimate to $500,000, and the committee had reduced it to 225,0'JO. The increase in the appropriation was for tbe purpose of convert ing smooth bore eannon into rilled guns. If Congress continued to appropriate $225,000 a year for that purpose, it would be twenty years before enough would be converted to arm the forts in the harbor of New York. Mr. Reagan moved to amend by making an appropriation of $50,000 for batteries for de fense of Galveston harbor. He spoke in favor of his amendment. Messrs. Baker, Hawley and Olymer opposed the amendment. The latter said the committee was unauimous in opinion that it was neither wise nor necessary at this time to enter upon any general system of sea coast fortification. Mr. Reagan's amendment was adopted, and the committee rose and reported tbe bill to the House, and it passed. THE PENSION BILL. The House then went into committee of the whole on the pension appropriation bill, and Mr. Hubbell proceeded to explain the bill. It appropriates $32,424,000 aa against $29,266,000 last year, that tbe increase bad been necessi tated by the large increase in the number of pensioners durine the past year. The bill was agreed to in committee without amendment, and on being reported to the House was passed. AN OLD CLAIM PASSED. The House went into committee of the whole on the private calendar. The first bill on the calendar was on appropriating $20,000 as indemnity and compensation to the widow and heirs of Henry Lief, in consequence of il legal seizure of the bark Mary Thiers by the United States consul at Bahia, Brazil. The claim had been before Congress for thirty years, and had five times been reported fa vorably to the House by the committee on commerce. Finally tbe committee rose and re ported the bill to the House, where it passed. Yeas, 125 nays, 76, the opposition being led by Conger.

The Western Union Telegraph company, in response to the subpoena issued by the Senate committee on privileges and elections for the production of all messages in regard to Senator Ingalls' election, and all books and records of certain officers covering the first six months of 1879, whioh subpoena was made returnable on the Uth inst, have asked and obtained exten sion of time till next Monday, when they pro pose to appear before the committee by coun sel and show cause why the subpoena should not be obeyed. It iB understood that refusal is based upon the ground that the 1 the the subject of the controversy, and tb.i ta r:attemptind company conceive it to be the duty of their POSTPONING THE STBUGGLE. The Senate finance committee has postponed till after Christmas recess, tbe Warner silver bill, the trade dollar bill, and Bayard's resolu tion concerning greenbacks, on the ground that the subjects require fuller discussion than could be given by the committee before ad journment. There was some informal discussion of Bay ard's resolution, from the tenor of whioh, and the known opinion of two members who were absent, it may be foreshadowed that Senators Voorhees, Ferry, Jones of Nevada, and Allison will oppose a favorable report upon tbe resolu tion, and that Eernan, Wallace and Morrill will earnestly support Bayard in its advocacy. The casting vote upon the question of reporting it is, therefore, to be given by Senator Beok, who has not yet indicated what position he will take in regard to it. A prominent member of the committee said to-day that tbe trade dollar bil will undoubtedly be reported by the commit tee, with the amendment proposed by Senator Ferry at the last session, viz.: to provide that trade dollars offered in exchange for standard dollars shall be received only at their market value as bullion, and that the amount of trade dollars converted into standard dollats by're coinage shall be counted as part of the annual maximum coinage of the latter as now author ized by law.
