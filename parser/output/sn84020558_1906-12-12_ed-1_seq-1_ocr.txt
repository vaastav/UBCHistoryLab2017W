This was a historic day for France. The struggle which began in 18S0 with the banishment of the Jesuits, ended today with the legal rupture of the bond which for practic ally a thousand uninterrupted years had united church and state. By re fusing to make the required declara tions under the public meeting law of ISfil, public Catholic worship except by the schismatic organizations, tomorrow b'-comes illegal. The scents in some of the churches were extremely touch ing. Not In years had there been such an attendance at mass. The number of women, especially large, was notewor thy as indicating the religious indiffer ence of the male population. Although seven-eighths of the inhabitants- are nominally Catholics, in no part of the city were the churches crowded. Eveq in Notre Dame cathedral where solemn high mass was celebrated, the edifice was only half filled. The officiating clergy read the reg ular offices of the week as usualwtth out referring to the illegal status of services tomorrow. Nevertheless, the lepression of the Catholics was mani fest. Many women emerged from the cathedral weeping. Minister of Public Worship Briand announces that the government cannot lie "driven into the trap of closing the churches," and Cardinal RIcard, Arch bishop of Paris, has strongly censured HURRY!

FRIEDMAN, Mf'g Jeweler, 8 ti$. u THE Vi PAGES to tlie Vatican to Deride the placarding of the appeals to the clergy to make a" violent resistance to the officers. "There must be no vio lence," he said, '"but a passive resist ence to an unjust law after exhausting all protests at every step." This Is the disposition so far as the higher ecclesiastics are concerned but their followers evidently have no In tention of submitting and are pre paring to assume the role of martyrs, abandon the churches and organize private worship. The Republic Francais says: "The time has passed when the iwijie couli successfully threaten to release French subjects from allegiance. A defiance of the law will only expose rfhe priests to being regarded as subjects of for eign power by which they would for feit the rights of Fienchmen." Premier Clemenceuu, replying t i question in the chamber of deputies tonight as to the reason for the expul sion of Monsignor Montagninl. said it was because of his complicity with prominent clergymen of Paris against whom proceedings were pending for inciting churchgoers to rebellion. In terference by foreigners on orders from Itome In the politics of France, he de clared, was not permissible. The pre mier, amid thunders of applause. -summed up the situation, declaring the government's conciliatory propositions toward the church had been exhausted and that it had been decided in futur to leave the onus n Rome. "If the church wishes," the premier concluded, "there is still time to avoid battle. VV offer her the law of 1SS1 made for all Frenchmen submitting thereto. She will have peace but oth erwise, l.y seeking us. she will find us. " Christmas day will coon be here. The happiest time of all the year.
