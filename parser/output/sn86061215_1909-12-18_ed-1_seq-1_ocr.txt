VOLUME 62 & ZELAYA SAYS I IN CONCILIATORY MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT, DICTATOR SAYS HE WILL LEAVE COUNTRY BUT WILL STAND BY HIS ACTS. MADRIZ WILL BE NEW PRESIDENT .UNITED 8TATES DOES NOT LIKE HIM, BUT WILL NOT OPPOSE ELECTION TO DEMAND PUN­ ISHMENT OF ZELAYA. Washington, D. C., Dec. 17—Rep resentative Suizer introduced a resolution today that the United 6tate& immediately recognize Estrada as president of Nica ragua. Managua, Nicaragua, Dec. 17.—Ze l&ya last night cabled a conciliatory message to president Taft, saying he had shown his good faith by resign ing in order that Nicaragua might re sume friendly relations with the Unit ed States. He added that he proposed to leave the country, but stood ready to account for his acts as president. Dr. Julian Irias, minister general, has been created a general, supposed ly with a view to his elevation to su premo command of the army when Madriz assumes the presidency. The opponents of Madriz claim this will re sult virtually in a military dictator ship by Irias. Madriz Not Popular Here. Washington, Dec. 17.—The passing of Zelaya as a dominent influence for evil in Central America and especially in Nicaragua is regarded here as a long step In the direction of better things. The government does not take kindly to the move to make Madriz president, although it is improbable the United States will take active measures to prevent his installation as president in the event of his being regularly placed in temporary power and later fairly elected. Want Zelaya Punished. The murder of Cannon and Groce is a matter entirely separated from the other questions involved, and at the proper time when the proper gov ernment has been installed the United States will demand reparation and that demand probably will involve the arrest and punishment of Zelaya. Zelaya resigned from the .presidency of Nicaragua by placing his resigna tion in the hands of congress yester day. Apparently there was no other course for Mm to take. The people •were at last aroused. The guns of the revolutionists threatened. The war ships of the United States lay in Nica raguan ports. Managua has been seething for days. The spirit of revolt has spread even to the gates of the palace. Zelaya surrounded himself With an armed guard. Unchecked, th-i populace have inarched through the streets, crying for the end of the old, proclaiming the new regime. Who will take tip the reins—no one knows or cares. It Is sufficient that Zelaya as dictator will be known no Bnore. There is no doubt, that congress will act quickly on his resignation, for the people have demanded it. Dr. Jose Madriz, judge of the Cen tral American court of justice at Cart ago, who has been close to Zelaya and is now his choice for president, Is on his way here. He will arrive on Satur day. Madriz has his following, strong and influential, even among the revo lutionists, but General Estrada, un der whose command the great body of fighting insurgents now face Vasquez's troops at Rama, will have none of him. Zelaya has known, too, that Madriz is not acceptable to the United States and he has sought to learn who would be looked upon with favor by that government as his successor, but the American government so far as can be learned, has named no man and the choice probably will lie with those who have gained the upper hand. Accompanying his resignation Ze laya sent the following message to congress: Zelaya's Message. "The painful circumstances in which the country is plunged call for acts of abnegation and patriotism on the part of good citizens, who are^ the witnesses of the oppression of the republic by the heavy hand of fate. The country has been staggering under the shame less revolution which threatens the national sovereignty, and a foreign nation unjustly intervenes In our af fairs, publicity providing the rebels with arms, which has only, resulted in their being defeated everywhere through the heroism of our troops. To avoid further bloodshed, and for the reason that the revolutionists have de clared that they would put down their arms when I surrendered the executive power, I hereby place in the hands of the national assembly the abandon ment of the remainder of my term of office, which is to be filled by a sub stitute of their choosing, with 'the hope that this will result in good to Nica ragua, the reestablishment of peace and particularly the suspension of the hostility of the United States, to which ..

ILLINOIS ATTORNEY GENERAL ARGUING BE'ORE STATE SU PREME COURT DECLARES I. C. WITHHELD BIG SHARE. SECRETARY OF WAR APPEARS FOR ROAD DICKINSON SECURED TAFT'S PROMISE TO PERMIT HIM TO ACT IN THIS CASE BEFORE EN­ TERING THE CABINET. Springfield, 111., Dec. 17.—Attorney General Stead prefaced his argument before the judges of the supreme court in a suit to compel the Illinois Central to account for 7 per cent of Its gross receipts from charter lines, here today, with a statement of the case by which the state of Illinois seeks to recover approximately $20, 000,000 from tne railroad. Road Compared to Judas. The attorney general showed the state had given the company 2,595,0D0 acres of land as right of way and he claimed this had been sold by the road for $30,000,000, which was more than sufficient to build the road. "The claim now ma'de bv the Illi nois Central," said Stead," "that it owes the state nothing because of this land grant, is an example of ingrati tude that has no parallel since the time of Judas Iscariot." Contract Vloiated State Claims. The charter granted the railroad, he claimed, was an absolute contract •by which the state was to receive not less than 7 per cent of the gross re ceipts and the company was to furnish the state detailed accounts of the re ceipts since 1877. This accounting was not kept satisfactorily to the state, he said. The lines of the company had been extended until now there were 4,377 miles- and upon all this mileage the state claims a pro rata share. Another point made in the counsel for the state was that in the matter of bridge earnings at Cairo and Du buque the state is entitled to at least $7,000,000 more than it has received. The question of profit from dining car service was also touched on. War Secretary Represents Road. Secretary of War Dickinson was in court, prepared to present his argu ment for the Illinois Central road, of which he was general counsel when the suit was begun. When he was appointed to the president's cabinet it was with the understanding that he could represent the railroad in this case when it came up for adjudication in the supreme court. Mr. Dickinson would not discuss politics. 

VOTE BEATS CAR FRANCHISE. Kansas City, Mo., at Special Election, Defeats Proposition For an Extension. Kansas City, Dec. 17.—The proposi tion to extend the franchise of the Metropolitan Street Car company, which now holds the traction rights of the city up to 1925, for a period of twenty-six years, or forty-two years from the present, was defeated at a special election here yesterday by a majority of 7,091.' The total vote cast was 30,371, of which 18,731 were against and 11,640 for the grant. The company now charges a straight 5 cent fare, but the proposed contract provides that not later than Jan. 1, 1913, the company shall sell twenty-five tickets for $1 and six for 25 cents. The opponents of the franchise ar gued that the potency of this conces sion was destroyed by another clause which, in referring to the city's right to reduce fares before 1925, provided that "all existing rights both of tne city and the company are in this re gard hereby expressly reserved and remain unafTected by the contract.
