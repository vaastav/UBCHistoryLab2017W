D- of President Jonoif. We hare, ipace for 1. onlj tbe gist of Ihe varioui eommeoU: Tbo New York Journal of Commtrce The itjle of the message placet it very far above anything of Hi kind for many jean. It Is awe vifiorouf , anJ, aa it approacno the on- elusion, rises to eloaueuoe seldom eaualed, perhaps never surpassed In any American State paper. The New York Timtt Probably no Ex ecutive dooument was ever awaited with greater Interest. IUi aafa.to. $ that none erer gave greater satisfaction wheareeelred. Its views, on the most momentnoas snbjeets, domestlo and foreign, that aver conoernod the nation, are full of wiidom, and are con veyed with great force and dignity. The whole dooument is one of which everv Amer- lut may well be proud, for its elevation of tone, its practical wisdom and Its quiet ex hibition of the national strength and glory. It will bo admired not only at home, but can not fait of making a most favorable im pression all over the civilised world. The New York Tt-VWIt is for Mr. John on now to chooso whether he will push on vigorously the work of restoration, by him so well begun, and in which he has bad the moral support and hearty approbation of every Northern Democrat, or whether he will lie down as tamely as tbe conservative Republicans hare done, and euttsltos pusll Innlmously as they to the rough-riding noofs of Thaddeus Stevens and his radical crew. Tho New York Tribune ' doubt wheth er any former message has. on the whole, con talned so much that will be generally and justly approved, with so littlo that will or should proroVe dissent, ii Is aBUtfo paper of signal ability and of unusual frankness, denting nnresorvedly will, every great ques tion of Internal or International potfoy, and calculated to increaio the hold of Its author on the regard And confidence of the Ameri can people. The New York Sun It Is unquestionably one of tbe most ablo State papers that has emanated from the Executive for many years. The messago is a credit to Us author, and will receive the commendation of alt Im partial readers. Tho Kew York JleraUU will commend Itself to the special attention of tho reader and to the general approval of tha Amorfean people. t is a smoothly-written State paper. It embodies a clear, frank, and un reserved exposition of the views and pur pores by which he has been guided in his policy of Southern restoration. The Philadelphia Lutger thinks President Johnson's first annual message will chal lenge attention and approval, sot less on ac count of the great questions of which It treats than of its intrinsic merits.

It was n question whether our numerical strength and resources were not more than balanced by these disadvan tages and tho enemy's superior position, "From tbe first I was firm In the convic tion that no peace could be had that would be stable and conducive to tbe happiness of the poople, both North and South, until the military power of the rebellion was entirely broken, "I therefore determined, first, tn use the greatest number of troops practicable agairst tha armed forco of tbe enemy, pre e nting him from using th. same force at dHToront seasons against first one and then another of our armies, and the pos slblllty of Toroso for refitting andprodncingnoceHaryrupplles for carrying on resistance.

' Ktsewbero be adds "I may state that, commandinr all tha armies as I did, I tried, as far as possible, to leal e Gen. Meade in Independent command of tbe Army of the Potomac. My Instruc tions for that army were all through him, and were general in their nature, leav!n;all tbe detail and tbe execution to him. The campaigns that followed proved him to be tbe right man In Ibe right place.

General Grant does not commend General Butler's military operations. Of tne early movement against Richmond he gives the history, nr.d the following comment, which we extract from tho text; My first object being to break the mili tary power oi tbe rebolllon and canture the enemy's strongholds, made me derirous that uenerai jjutier snouid succeed In bis move ments asainst Richmond, as that would tend more than anything else, unless it were the capture of Lee's nrinv. to accoranllsh this Uesired result In the Fast. If he failed, It was my determination, by hard fighting, either to compel Lee to retreat, or to so crip ple him that he could nut detach a largeforce to go North and still retain enough for tbe defence of Richmond. It was well under stood, by both Generals Ilutlor and Meade, before starting on the campaign, that it was my intention to put both their armies south of the James river in case of failure to do stroy Leo without it. "Before giving General Butler his Instruc tions, I lsitod him at Fortress Monroe, and in conversation pointed out tho apparent importance of gotling possession of Peters burg and destroying railroad communication as far south as possible. "Believing, however, tn the practicability of capturing Richmond unless it was rein forced, I made that the objeotlvo point of bis operations As tho Army of the Potomac wastomoio simultaneously with him, Lee could not detach from his army with safety, and the enemy did not bale troops elsewhere to bring to tho defonco of tho city in time to mtot a rapid movement from the north of Jumes river. "Un tbe evening of the 13th and morning of the 14th ho carried a portion of the ene my's first lino of defences at Drury's I) In IT, or Port Darling, with small loss. The timo thus consumed from tho 6th lost to us the benefit of the surprise and capture of Rich mond and Petersburg, enabling, as It did, Beauregard to collect his loose forces In North and Soutli Carolina, and bring them to the defence of those places. On tho lGth the enemy attacked Ooneral Butler In his position in front of Drury's Bluff. He was forced back, or drew buck, lntobls entrench ments between Ihe forks of the James and Annomattox rh ers, the enemy entrenchine? strongly In his front, thus coloring his rail roads, the city, ana an mat wns vaiuablo to bim. Ills nrmy, therefore, though in a. post thin of crest security, was as completely shut off from further operations directly against Richmond as If tt naa otcn in a bottle strong ly corked, It required but a comparatively small force of the enemy to hold It there. w "The army sent to operate against Richmond baiingbermettcally sealed itself up at Bermuda Hundreds, the enemy was enabled to bring the most if nut all tho reinforcements brought from the South by NO. 10. rnKSIDEST. 1 Beauregard agatrut the 'mae.

Then, after destroying his lines of commu nication north of the James river, to trans fer th. army to tbe south aide and besiege Lee In Richmond, or follow bim south If he should retreat After tbe battl of the Wil dcrness.lt was evident that the enemy deemed it of the first Importance to run no risks with the armr he then had. lis acted nnrrlv on the defensive behind breastworks, or feebly on th. offensive Immediately in front cf tbeu, and where, In cose of repulse, be could easily retire behind them. Without a greater sacrlfiee'bf life than I was willing to make, all could not be accomplished that I had designed north of Richmond. I there fore determined to continue to hold substan tially tbe ground we then occupied, taking adrantage of any favorahlo circumstances that might present themselves, until the cav alry could be sent to Charlottesville and Gordonsvllle, to effectually break np the rail road connection between Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley and Lynchburg; and, when the cat airy got well off, to move tbe army to tbe south side of the James river, by tho e neray'a right flank, where I felt I could cut off .11 his sources of supply except by the canaL Dnrlng three long years the Armies of the Potomao and Northern Vir ginia had been confronting each other. In that tlm. tbeyhad fonght more desperate battles than It probably ever before fell to the lot of two armies to fiaht. without mala. rlally changing the vantage ground of either. The Southern press and people, with more shrewdness than was displayed In the North, finding that they had failed to capture Wash ington and march en to New York, as they bad boasted they would do, assumed that iney oniy ueienuea tneir capital and South ern territory, llrnco, Anil. tarn, Gettysburg, and ell the other battles that had been fought, were by them set down as failures on our part, and victories for them. Their army believed this- It produced a marali which could only be overcome by desperate ana continuous hard fighting Tha battles of tbe Wilderness, Spottsylvania, North Anna, and Cold Harbor; bloody and terrible as tbey were on our side, were even more damaging to the enemy, and so crippled bim as to make him wary erer after of taking the offensive. Uls losses in men were probably not so great, owing to the fact that we were, save in the Wilderness, almost Invariably the attacking party; and when beVUd. attack It waa In the open field.
