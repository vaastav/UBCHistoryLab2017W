THE BAHRE DAILY TIMES. BAR RE. Vt.. TUESDAY. DECEMBER 5. 1911. THE PRESIDENT CHAMPIONS ANTI- RUST The Force and Effectiveness of Statute a Matter of Growth- New Remedies Suggested by President Taft in Annual Mes sage. !N0T REPEAL OR AMENDMENT ; BUT SUPPLEMENTAL LAWS The Tobacco Trust Decision an ; Effective One-Federal Incor poration Recommended and j: a Federal Corporation Com mission Proposed. 'I Washington, D. C, Doc, 5. President Taft's third annual message to Congress, devoted exclusively to the Sherman anti trust act and the trust question in gen eral, was read in Congress to-day. The president defended thtv Sherman act as interpreted by the supreme court of the United States, indicated plainly his op position to the repeal or amendment of this statute, but , suggested that Con gress pass a federal incorporation law and supplemental legislation that "would describe and denounce methods of com petition that are unfair." To supervise corporations 'chartered under federal hw, President Taft pro posed the creation of an executive bureau or commission, with powers akin to those of the interstate-commerce commission. Speaking of the much-discussed disso lution of the tobacco trust, the presi dent declnred that in his opinion "not in the history of American law has a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered by a court." To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: This message is the first of several which 1 shall scad to congress during the Interval between the opening of Its regular session and Us adjourn ment for the Christmas holidays. The amount of Information to be commu nicated as to the operations of the government, the number of Important subjects calling for comment by the executive and the transmission to con gress of exhaustive reports of special roru missions make It Impossible to In clude in one message of a reasonable length n discussion of the topics that might to be brought to the attention of the national legislature at Its first regular session. The Anti-trust LawThe 8upreme Court Deoitions. In May last the supreme coart band ed down decisions In the suits in equi ty brought by the United States to en Join the further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri can Tobacco trust and to secure tbelr dissolution. The decisions ara epoch .making and serve to advise the busi ness world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti-trust act of 1S90. The decisions do not de part in any substantial way from the previous decisions of the court In con Ftrulng and applying this Important statute, but they clarify those deci sions by further defining the already Admitted exceptions to the literal con struction of the act. By the decrees they furnish a useful precedent as to the proper method of dealing with the capital and property of illegal trusts. These decisions suggest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make It easier for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality thus finally established and to pre serve the benefit, freedom and spur-of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress. No Changs In the Rule of Decision, Merely In Its Form of Expression. The statute in Its first section de clares to be illee'al "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy In restraint of trade or commerce among the sev eral states or with foreign nations" and In the second declares Kuflty of a misdemeanor "every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of the several stutes or with foreign nations." In two early cases, whore the statute was invoked to enjoin transporta tion rate agreement between Inter state railroad companies, it was held that it was no defense to show that the agreement as to rates complained of was reasonable at common law, be cause it was said that the statute was directed against all contracts and com binations in restraint of trade, whether reasonable at common law or not It was plain from the record, however, that the contracts complained of In those cases would not have been deem ed reasonable at common law. In sub sequent cases the court said that the statute should be given a reasonable construction and refused to Include within its inhibition certain contrac tual restraints of trade which it de nominated as incidental or as indirect 

STATUTE These cases of restrant of trade that the court excepted from the operation of the statute were Instances which at common law would have been cull ed reasonable. In the Standard Oil and tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely ndopted the tests of the com mon law and In defining exceptions to the literal application of the statute only substituted for the test of being Incidental or Indirect that of being reasonable, and this without varying in the slightest. the actual scope and effect of the statute. In other words, all the cases under the statute which have now been decided would have been decided the same way If the court had originally accepted la Its construction the rule at common law. I It has been said that the court by in troducing into the construction of the statute common law distinctions has emasculated It. This is obviously un true. By its Judgment every contract and combination in restraint of Inter state trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices by stifling competition or of establish ing in whole or in part a monopoly of such trade is condemned by the stat ute. The most extreme critics cannot instance a ense that ought to be con demned under the Btatute which Is not brought within its terms as thus con strued. The suggestion is also made that the supreme court by its decision in the last two cases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited dis cretion to determine whether n case of restraint of trade is within the terms of the statute. This is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at com mon law is well understood and is clearly del ned. It does not rest in the discretion of the court. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of a lawful main contract to which in order that it shall be enforceable at all it mnst be Incidental. If it exceed the needs of that contract it la void. The test o reasonableness was never applied by the court at com man law to contracts or combinations or con spiracies in restraint of trade whose purpose was or whose necessary effect would be to stifle competition, to con trol prices or establish monopolies. The courts never assumed power to say that such contracts or combina tions or conspiracies might be lawful if the parties to them were only mod erate in the use of the power thus se cured and did not exact from the pub lic too great and exorbitant prices. It is true that mnny theorists and others engaged in business violating the Btat ute have hoped that some such line could be drawn by court, but no court of authority has ever attempted it Certainly there is nothing in the deci sions of the latest two cases from which such a dangerous theory of Ju dicial discretion in enforcing this stat ute can derive the slightest sanction. Force and Effectiveness of Statute a -Matter of Growth. ; We have been twenty-one years mak ing this statute effective for the pur poses for which it was enacted. The Knight case was discouraging and seemed to remit to the states the whole available power to attack and suppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, howev er, the error of that Judgment was cor rected, and only in the last three or four years has the heavy' hand of the law been laid upon the great Illegal combinations that have exercised such an absolute domiulon over many of our Industries. Criminal prosecutions have been brought, and a number are pend ing, but Juries have felt averse to con victing for- jnll sentences and Judges buve been most reluctant ,to impose such sentences on men of respectable standing in society whose offense bus been regnrded as merely statutory. Still, as the offense becomes better un derstood and the committing of it par takes more of studied and deliberate defiance of the law we can be confi dent that Juries will convict individu als and that Jail sentences will be im posed. The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution. In the Standard Oil case the supreme and circuit courts found the combina tion to be a monopoly of the interstate business of refining, transporting and marketing petroleum and Its products, effected and maintained through thirty-seven different corporations, the stock of which was held by a New Jer sey company. It In effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, di rected the transfer ami pro rata distri bution by the New Jersey company of the stock held by it in the thirty-seven corporations to and among its stock holders, and the corporations and indi vidual defendants were enjoined from couspiring or combining to restore such monopoly, and nil agreements be tween the subsidiary corporations tend ing to produce" or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined. In the tobacco case the court found that the individual defendants, twenty-nine lu number, bud been engaged in a successful effort to acquire com plete dominion over the manufacture. ! sale and distribution of tobacco in this country and abroad and that this bad been done by combinations made with , a purpose and effect to stifle competi tion, control prices and establish a monopoly, not only in the manufacture of tobacco, but also of tin foil and lic orice used in its manufacture and of its products of cigars, cigarettes and snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a ' far more complicated and difficult case I than the Standard Oil suit for a decree j which would effectuate the will of the t court and end the violation of the stat ute. There was here no single hold ing company, as in the case of the Standard Oil trust The main company was the American Tobacco company, manufacturing... jselllng. and. holding company. Theplan adopted to de stroy the combination and restore com petition involved the redivision of the capital and plnnts of the whole trust between some of the companies con stituting the trust and new companies organized for the purposes of the de cree and made parties to it and num bering, new and old, fourteen. Situation After Readjustment. The Americun Tobacco company (old), readjusted cnpltnl $02,000,000; the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company (new), capital $;7.000.000; the P. Lorll lard company (new), capital $47,000, 000. and the It. J. Reynolds Tobacco company (old), capital $7.52r.000. are chiefly engaged In the manufacture and sale of chewing and smoking to bacco and cigars. The former one tin foil company Is divided Into two. one of $82.",0(X) capital and the other of $400,000. The one snuff company is divided Into three companies, one with a capltol of $15.0(10.000. another with a capital of $3,000,000 and a third with a capital of $S.0O0.0OO. The licorice companies are two. one with a capital of $5,758,300 and another with a capi tal of $2,000,000. There is also the British-American Tobacco company, a British corporation, doing business abroad with a capital of $20,000,000. the Porto Rlcnn Tobacco company, with a capital of $1,800,000. and the corporation of United Cigar Rtores, with a capital of $0,000,000. Under this arrangement each of the different kinds of business will be dis tributed between two or more compa nies with a division of the prominent brands in the same tobacco products, so as to make competition not only possible, but necessary. Thus the smoking tobacco business of the coun try is divided so that the present in dependent companies have 21.39 per rent, while the American Tobacco com pany will have 83.08 per cent, the Lig gett & Meyers 20.05 per cent, the Loril lard company 22.82 per cent and the Reynolds company 2.06 per cent. The stock of the other thirteen companies, both preferred and common, has beeu taken from the defendant American Tobacco company and bas been dis tributed among its stockholders. Ail covenants restricting competition have been declared null and further per formance of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different companies has now been given voting power which was denied It under the old organization. The ratio of the pre ferred stock to the common was as 73 to 40. This constitutes a very decided change In the character of the owner ship and control of each company. In the original suit there were twen-' tynine defendants, who were charged with being the conspirators through whom the illegal combination acquired and exercised its unlawful dominion. Under the decree these defendants will bold amounts of stock in the various distributee companies ranging from 41 per cent as a maxjmum to 2 per cent as a minimum, except in the case of one small company, the Porto Ricsn Tobacco company, in which they will hold 45 per cent The twenty-nine In dividual defendants are enjoined for three years from buying any stock ex cept from each other, and the group is thus prevented from extending its con trol during that period. - Ail parties to the suit and the new companies who are made parties are enjoined perpet ually from in any way effecting any combination between any of the com panies in violation of the statute by way of resumption of the old trust Each of the fourteen companies is en Joined from acquiring stock in any of the others. All these companies are enjoined from having common direc tors or officers, or common buying or .selling agents, or common offices, or lending money to each other. 1 Size of New Companies. Objection was made by certain in dependent tobacco companies that this settlement was unjust because it left companies with very large capital in active business and that the settle ment that would be effective to put all on an equality would be a division of the capital and plant of the'trust Into small fractions In amount more near ly equal to that of each of the inde pendent companies. This contention results from a misunderstanding of the anti trust law and its purpose. It is not intended thereby to prevent the accumulation of Inrge capltar in busi ness enterprises In which such a com bination can secure reduced cost of production, sale and distribution. ' It is directed against such an aggrega tion of capital only when its purpose Is that of stifling competition, enhanc ing or controlling prices and establish ing a monopoly. If we shall have by the decree defeated these purposes and restored competition between the large units into which the capital and plant have been divided we shall have accomplished the useful . purpose of the statute. Confiscation Not the Purpose of the Statute. It is not the purpose of the. statute to confiscate the property and capital of the offending trusts. Methods of punishment by fine or Imprisonment of the individual offenders, by fine of the corporation or by forfeiture of its goods in transportation are provided, but the proceeding in equity Is a spe cific, remedy to stop the operation of the trust by injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital in violation of the statute. Effectiveness of Decree. I venture to say that not in the his tory of American law-has a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered by a court than that against the tobacco trust As Circuit Judge Noyes said in his Judgment approving the decree: "The extent to which It has been necessary to tear apart this combina tion and force it into new forms with the attendant burdens ought to demon strate that the federal anti trust statute is a drastic statute which accomplishes effective results, which so long as it stands on the statute books must be obeyed and which cannot be disobey-, ed without incurring farreachlng pen alties. And, on the other hand, the successful reconstruction of this or ganization should teach that the effect of enforcing this statute is not to de stroy, but to reconstruct: not to de molish, but to recreate In accordance with the.conditipns. which the congress

Attempt to determine line be tween ''good" and "bud" trusts lias failed. Confiscation is not intended in Btatute. , has declared" shall exist among the people of the United States." Common Stock Ownership. It has been assumed that the pres ent pro rata and common ownership in all these companies by former stock holders of the trust would Insure a continuance of the same old single con trol of all the companies Into which the trust has by decree been disinte grated. This is erroneous and is based upon the assumed ineffleocy and innoc uousness of Judicial Injunctions." The companies are enjoined from co-opera tion or combination; they have differ ent managers, directors, purchasing and sales agents. If all "or many of the numerous stockholders, reaching into the thousands, attempt to secure concerted action of the companies with a view to the control of the market their number is so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed, and Its prime movers andjill its partic ipants would 1 at once subject to con tempt proceedings nnd imprisonment of a summary character. The immedi ate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by nil the com panies tinder different managers, and then competition must follow or there will be activity by one company and stagnation, by nnothoc. " Only a short time will inevitably lead to a change In ownership of the stock, as all op portunity for continued co-operation must disappear. Those critics who speak of this disintegration in the trust as a mere change of garments have not given consideration to the inevitable working of the decree and understand little the personal danger of attempt ing to evade or set at naught the sol emn injunction of a court whose object is made plain by the decree and whose inhibitions are set forth with a detail nd comprehensiveness unexampled In the history of equity Jurisprudence. Voluntary Reorganizations of Other Trusts at Hand. The effect of these two decisions bas led to decrees dissolving the combina tion of manufacturers of electric lamps, a southern , wholesale grocers association, an lnterfocutory decree against the powder trust, with direc tions by the circuit court compelling dissolution, and other combinations of a similar history are now negotiating with the department Of Justice looking to a disintegration by decree and re organizntlon in accordance with law. It seems possible to bring about these reorganizations without general busi ness disturbance. Movement For Repeal of tho Anti trust Law. But now that the anti-trust act is seen to be effective for the accomplish ment "of the purpose of its enactment we are met by a cry from many differ ent quarters for its repeal. It is said to be obstructive of business progress, to be an attempt to restore old fash ioned methods of destrnctive competi tion between small units and to make impossible those useful combinations of capital and the reduction of the cost of production that are essential to con tinued prosperity nnd normal growth. In the recent decisions the supreme court makes clear that there is noth ing in the statute which condemns combinations of capital or mere big ness of plont organized to secure econ omy in production and a reduction of its cost, it is only- when the .purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or the aggregation of immense size are the stifling of competition, actual and potential, and the enhancing of prices and establishing a monopoly that the statute is violated. Mere size Is no sin against the law. The merging of two or more business plants necessari ly eliminates competition between the units thus combined, but this elimina tion is In contravention of the statute only when the combination Is made for purpose of ending this particular com petition In order to secure control of and enhance prices and create a mo nopoly. Lack of Definiteness In the Statute. The complaint Is made of the stat ute that it Is not sufficiently definite in its description of that which is for bidden to enable business men to avoid Its violatlou. The suggestion Is that we may have n combination of two corporations which may run on for years and that subsequently the at torney general may conclude thnt it was a violation of the statute and that which was supposed by the combiners to be innocent then turns out to be a combination in violation of the statute. The answer to this hypothetlcc! case is that when men attempt to amass such stupendous capital as will enable them to suppress competition, control prices and establish a monopoly they know the purpose of their nets. Men do not do such a thing without having it clearly in mind. If what tbey do is merely for the purpose of reducing the cost of production, without the thought of Suppressing competition by use of the .bigness of the plant they are creating, then they cannot be convicted at the time the union is mndc, nor can they be convicted later unless It happen that later on they conclude to sup press competition and take the usual methods for dolngso and thus estab lish for themselves a monopoly. They can in such a case hardly complain If the motive which subsequently Is dis closed is attributed by the court to the original combination. I New Remedies Suggested. j Much U said of the repeal of thlsi statute and of constructive, legislation intended' to accomplish the purpose and blnze a clear path for honest mer chants and business men to follow. It may be that such a plan will be evolved, but I submit that the discus slons which have been brought out In recent days by the fear of the con tinued execution of the anti-trust law have produced nothing but glittering generalities and have offered no line of distinction or rule of action ns dell nlte and as clear as that which the su preme court Itself lays down In en forcing the Btatute. Supplemental Legislation Needed, Not Repeal or Amendment. I see no objection, and Indeed I can see decided advantages, in the enact ment of A law which shall describe and denounce methods of competition which are unfair nnd nre badges of the unlawful purpose denounced In the anti trust law. The attempt and pur pose to suppress a competitor by un derselling him at a price so unprofita ble as to drive him out of business or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they nre re quired to give up association with oth er manufacturers nnd numerous kin dred methods for stifling competition nnd effecting monopoly should be do scr!led with sufficient accuracy In a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the government to shorten Its task by prosecuting single misdemean ors Instead of an entire conspiracy and on the other hand to serve the purpose of pointing out more In detail to the business community what must be avoided. Federal Incorporation Recommended. In a special message to congress on Jan. 7. 1910. I ventured to point out the disturbance to business that would probably attend the dissolution of these offending trusts. I said:. "But such an investigation and pos sible prosecution of corporations whose prosperity or destruction affects the comfort not only of stockholders, but of millions of wage earners, employees and associated tradesmen, must neces sarily tend to disturb the confidence of the business community, to dry up the now flowing sources of capital from its places of boarding and pro duce a haft in onr present prosperity that will cause suffering and strained Circumstances among the Innocent many for the faults of the guilty few. The question which I wish in this message to bring clearly to the con sideration and discussion of congress is whether, in order to avoid such a possible business danger, something cannot bo done by which these busi ness combinations may be offered a means, without great financial dis turbance, of changing the character, organization and extent of their busi ness Into one within the lines of the law under federal control and super vision, securing compliance with the anti-trust statute, "Generally In the Industrial combina tions called trusts the principal busi ness is the sale of goods In many states and in foreign markets In other words, the interstate and foreign business far exceeds the business done in any one state. This fact will Justify the fed eral government in granting a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell in interstate and foreign com merce the products of useful manufac ture under such limitations as wilt se cure a compliance with the anti trust law. It is possible so to frame a stat ute that while it offers protection to a federal company against harmful, vex atious and unnecessary invasion by the states, it shall subject it to reasona ble taxation and control by the states with respect to its purely local busi ness. ,. "Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited from acquir ing and holding stock in other corpo rations (except for special reasons, upon approval by the proper federal authority), thus avoiding the creation under national auspices of the holding company with subordinate corporations In different states, which bas been such an effective agency in the crea tion of the great trusts and monopo lies. . . , "It the prohibition of the anti trust act against combinations in restraint of trade is to be effectively enforced It Is essential that the national govern ment shall provide for the creation of national corporations to carry on a le gitimate business throughout the Unit ed States. The conflicting laws of the different states of the Union with re spect to foreign corporations make it difficult If not impossible, for one cor poration to comply with their require ments so as to carry on business in a number of different states." I renew the recommendation of the enactment of a general law providing for the voluntary formation of cor porations to engage in trade and com merce among the states and with for elgn nations. Every argument which was then advanced for such a law and every explanation which was at that time offered to possible objections has been confirmed by our experience since the enforcement of Hie anti-trust stat ute has resulted in the actual dissolu tion of active commercial organiza tions. ' It is even more manifest now than it was then that the denunciation of conspiracies In restraint of trade should not and does not mean the' de nial of organizations large enough to be intrusted with our interstate and foreign trade. It has been made more clear now than It was' then that a purely negative statute like the anti trust law may well be supplemented by specific provisions for the building up and regulation of legitimate na tional and foreign commerce. 4 Government Administrative Experts Needed to Aid Courts In Trust Dissolutions. The drafting of the decrees in the dissolution of the present trusts, with a view to their reorganization Into le gitimate corporations, has made It es pecially apparent that 'he courts are not provided with the administrative machinery to make the necessary in quiries preparatory to reorganization or to pursue Bach Inquiries, and they should be empowered to invoke the old of the bureau of corporations in determining the suitable reorganiza tion of the disintegrated parts.

Federal Corporation Commission Pro posed. I do not set forth in detail the terms nnd sections of a statute which might supply he constructive legislation per mitting and aiding the formation of omblnatlons of capital Into federal lorporntlons. They should be subject to rigid rules as to their organization and procedure, including effective pub licity, and to the closest supervision as to the Issue of stock and bonds by au executive bureau or commission in the department of commerce and labor, to which in times of doubt they might well submit their proposed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood thaMneorporatlon under a federal law could not exempt the com pany thus formed and Its Incorporators and managers from prosecution under the anti-trust law for subsequent Il legal conduct but the publicity of its procedure and the opportunity for fre quent consultation with the bureau or commission in charge of the incorpora tion as to the legitimate purpose of its transactions would offer It as great se curity against successful prosecutions for violations of the law ns would tot practical or wise. Such a bureau or commission might well be invested also with the duty already" referred to of aiding courts In the dissolution and recreation of trusts within the law. It should be an executive tribunal of the dignity and power of the comptroller of the cur rency or the interstate commerce com mission, which now exercises supervis ory power over important classes of corporations nnder federal regulation. The drafting of such a federal In corporation law would offer ample op portunity to prevent many manifest evils in corporate management today. Including irresponsibility of control In the hands of the few who are not the real owners. Incorporation Voluntary. I recommend that the federal char ters thus to be granted shall be volun tary, at least until experience Justifies mandatory provisions. The benefit to be derived from the operation of great businesses under the protection of such a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep within the lines of the law. Other large combinations that fall to take advantage of, the federal incorporation will not have a right to complain If tbelr failure is ascribed to unwillingness to submit their transac tions to the careful official scrutiny, competent supervision and publicity attendant upon the enjoyment of such a charter. Only Supplemental Legislation Needed. The opportunity thus suggested for federal Incorporation, it seems to me, is suitable constructive legislation needed to facilitate the squaring of great Industrial, enterprises to the rale Fortune Telling Does not take into consideration the one fir aT T.i T-yto .CI an's happiness womanly health.
