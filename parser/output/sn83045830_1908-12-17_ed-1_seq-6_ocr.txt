MARKET PROFESSIONAL ?och of Suging Attributed to Cover tof of Short Contracts. SM RAUS IttPfJRTANT SUBJECT ?lacing of Year's Order for Steel by Pennsylvania Railroad Settles Much Ducusaed Economical Ques? tion. (By Associated Pre as.) NEW YORK. Doc. 16.?Then- ?ras considerable re-purchase of slocks to? day largely by those who had sold yesterday and the day before. A re? covery iu prices was the consequence. The market, however, continued nar? row and professional, much of the buying being attributed to the cover Ing of short contracts p it out during the previous selling. { The upward movement was encour? aged by some of the events of the day. The speculation Is still restrict ed by the diminished resources of the money market and tb>- situation In that respect remained the principal subject of consideration. The posi? tion has not reached that of stringen? cy such as forces out speculative stockholdings by calling of loans, but available resources are required for other purposes than speculation. The level of lntere-st rateB both on call and on time has now reached a higher figure than at any time since January 1. The present condition has come to prevent sufficient tight? ness In the money market to remove the artificial stinrilvs to speculation which grew out of the bulky accumu? lation of idle funds in bank reserves. The official announcemt nt of the placing of the year's order for steel rails by the Pennsylvan'a Railroau was an important event owing to the long discussion that has gone on be? tween the parties over the specifica? tions fn the contract. The waiting on this settlement has been given as a motive for holding up of orders for materials all through the railroad world, which it is :i.-s;:ui. >i will be re? leased now The rumcr was revived also of the coming retirement of Reading 2nd preferred stock by exchange Into common and first preferred stock iu equal pcrtioa*.

PARTIES UNITE TO REBUKE ROOSEVELT (Continued from First Page). man. in his piercing voice, "whether he thinks the Senate has been insult? ed?'' Mr Hale Insisted that every one had his own opinion on that subject and anyone was as able as he to form an opinion. Coming again to his feet quickly Mr Tillman said that ac? cording to the President's message Congress is composed of a lot of "ras? cals and scoundrels, who belong In the penitentiary."
