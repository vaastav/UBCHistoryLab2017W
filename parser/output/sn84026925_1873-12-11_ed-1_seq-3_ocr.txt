commissioners to furnish the county school commissioners with an office; bill to better define the powers and duties of the county commissioners, in relation to the county liquor licenses. Mr. Rowley introduced a resolution that a committee of five he appointed by the speaker to examine into the unjust discrimination and refusal to employ colored compositors, and to recommend some practicable means to compel the Republican Printing Company to give the colored compositors of the State an equal opportunity with the white to obtain a livelihood. An amendment was offered, asking for the name of the stockholders of that company. The resolution and amendment were adopted. Saturday, Dec. 6. In* tiik Senate, the hill to make au apW propriation to pay the claims of the Citizens' J Savings Rank and the Central National Rank, was made the special order for December 12, at 1 p. m. Mr. Dunn sent to the desk, to be laid before the Senate, a communication from W. H. McCaw, reporter of the Charleston News, addressed to him relative to the matter in discussion the day previous, bearing upon the wrong language used in a letter to the Xeivs, concerning the bill to prevent discrimination in frieght and passenger charges. A general debate was had, after which the letter was returned to Mr. Dunn without being entered upon the journal. In the House, the proceedings present ! nothing of special interest. 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The message of President Grant to the j present session of Congress is the most lengthy 1 communication he has yet made. It opens ! by a reference to the financial crisis, makes ! the statement that political partizanship has almost ceased to exist, especially in the agricultural regions, which is supposed to have reference to the Grangers' movement; refers to the Virginius matter, which, he says, is in course of negotiation, and is likely to be amicably adjusted, honorable to both nations concerned. The message refers to the Vienna Exposition which was creditable to the artisans of the Uuited States; to the reception of the Western Ambassadors by the Emperor of China, and to the need of further legislation to suppras the coolie trade. It recommends a commission for the purnnse nf nnditimr and determining the amount to be paid for losses caused by the Confederate privateers. It refers to the Mixed Commissions for determining claims between British subjects and American citizeus, and asks for an appropriation to pay the amount of decisions against the United States, and also recommends a law creating a special court of three judges, to hear and determine all claims of aliens against the United States arising out of damages committed against their persons and property during the war. It asks the decesion of Congress on the subject of the action of the Ottomau and Egyptian V Governments relieving foreign consuls of judicial powers. The message discusses at some length the question of the right of extradition, especially as to citizens of the United States residing permanently abroad with their families, and suggests legislation on the subject. It refers to the establishment of a Republic in Spain, to the efforts of the new Government to abolish slavery in all its dominions, which efTorts are opposed by the reactionary slaveholders of Cuba, who are vainly striving to stop the march of civilization. The balcfui influence had thus succeeded in defeating the efforts of all liberal minded men in Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba, in preventing the - i - /* 1!-- ii.i :~i j T.? proposed reiormauou in unit lsiunu. m uic interest of humanity, of civilization, and of progress, it was to be hoped that the evil influence might be soon averted. In reference to the capture of the Virginius and to the inhuman and illegal murder of fifty-three of the passengers and crew, he says that the Spanish government had recognized the justice of this demand, and had arranged for the immediate delivery of the vessel and for the surrender of the survivors of the passengers and crew, and for a salute to the flag, and for proceedings looking to the punishment of those who may be proved to have been guilty of illegal acts of violence towards citizens of the United States, and also towards indemnifying those who may be shown to be entitled to indemnity. The correspondence on the subject had beeu conducted in cypher and by cable, and therefore was not in a condition to be submitted to Congress. The President expresses his conviction that the presence of African slavery in Cuba is a principal cause of the lamentable condition of the island, and does not doubt that Congress Knnoa fhaf if will ennn ho tn?wlo to Olitll CO ItlO 11 vpv-o biiuu tv mil wvvii MV m?%vtw VW disappear, and that peace and prosperity will follow its abolition. lie suggest two constitutional amendments One to authorize the President to approve so much of any measure of Congress as his judgment may dictate, without approving the i whole ; and the other, to provide that when an extra session of Congress is convened by executive proclamation, legislation shall he confined to such subjects as the Executive may bring before Congress from time to time in ; writing. He recommends the erection at Washing- j ton of suitable buildings for Cabinet officers! and for such officials as now receive cominu- j tatiou for quarters, thus setting au example to the Stales which may induce thera to erect j buildings for their Senators. The message goes very fully into the finan- | cial question, and declares that the country! never can have periuauent prosperity until ' specie payments be resumed. He recommends legislation preventing na-1 tional banks from paying interest on deposits j and forcing them into resumption if only in 1 legal tender notes. He suggests the question | whether banking should not be made free, but securing all the present privileges to bill j holders. He notices the improvement in American j ship building during the past year and hopes ' for a continuance of it. In regard to the problem of cheap trans- j ^ portatiou he refers to the Erie and Illinois j cauals and suggests whether it would not he wise statesmanship to pledge to the States j that own those canals that if they will enlarge j them, the geueral government will look after i and keep in navigable condition the great public highways with which these canals con- I . ..?11..J fi.,;,. ' IlCCt, L'J Wit ; 

LIIU UUIiSUU ilttl, uik Ijk. U|UII , flats and the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. ! He recommends a government exploration of the upper Amazon river and its tributaries ; a revision and codification of the tariff laws, 1 and the opening of more mints. The message endorses the recommendation of the Posmaster General for the establishment I ofpostoffice savings depositories, aud invites the consideration of Congress to the proposi-{ tion for a postal telegraph. He recommends Legislation in regard to the judicial proceed-' ings in Utah, and also in regard to the bankruptcy law which he considers as productive j of more evil than good. If not totally re-1 pealed it should be modified in those portions I1 providing for involuntary bankruptcy. Those portions should be repealed. He calls atten- | tion to the immense aggregate of claims against the Government, many of them growing out of the war, and not a few of them fabricated and supported by false testimony. He recommends that persons having claims be required to present them at an early period and . tiiat personal attendance of witnesses be required at court of claims. In regard to the Indian question, he recommends a territorial form of government for the Indian Territory. He also recommends such action as will permit the settlement of a body of Russian Colonists on the public lands, and endorses the proposition for a ceusus in 1875. He recommends the passage of an enabling act fur the admission of Colorado as a State, and suggests the opening of a canal for the purpose of irrigation from the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains to the Missouri ri vor. In conclusion, he renews his recommendation for general amnesty and says there are a number of persons yet laboring under disa-' bilities, very small, but enough to keep up a constant irritation. There can be no possible danger to the Government in restoring them i to eligibility to hold office, and suggests the enactment of a law better to secure the civil rights which freedom should secure, but has not effectually secured to the enfranchised slave. .financial anb Commercial. \

December 4 4!? dm? ~ ASIATIC CHOLERA IN~CTTINA7~ Almost Every Case Cured With A T 1V-TT 1 T , T , F. 1? ? I)kak Siiis: During a resilience of some ten years in Siamand China, as a missionary, I found your Pain-Killer a most valuable remedy for that fearful scourge the Cholera. In administering the medicine I found it most effectual to give a tea-spoonful of Pain-Killer in a gill of hot water sweetened with sugar; then, after about fifteen minutes, begin to give about a tablespoonful of the same mixture every few minutes until relief was obtained. Apply hot applications to the extremities. Rathe the stomach with the Pain-Killer, clear, and rub the limbs briskly. Of those who had the Cholera, and took the medicine faithfully, in the way stated above, eight out often recovered. 11 kv. R. TELFORD, Missionary in China. Rkar Sirs : During a long residence in China I have used your valuable Pain-Killer, both in my own family and among the Chinese, and have found it a most excellent medicine. In the Summers of 1802and isi>:5, while residing in Shanghai, I found it an almost certain cure for cholera, if used in time. Indeed, using it in a great many instances, I do not remember failing in a single ease. For three years I have been residing in this place, more than fifty miles from a physician, and have been obliged often to fall upon my own resources in eases of sickness. The Chinese come to us in great numbers for medicine and advice. Though without medical knowledge ourselves, the few simple remedies we can command are so much in advance oftheir physicians, that we have almost daily applications. We allow them to come, because it brings us in contact with them and opens a door of usefulness. In diarrhtca, colic, vomiting, cholera, coughs, etc., your PainKiller has been my chief medicine. Yours, very truly, Rkv. T. P. CRAWFORD, Tungehow, China. Those using Pain-Killer should strictly observe the following directions: At the commencement of the disease, take a tcasponfulof Pain-Killcr, in sugarand water, and then bathe freely across the stomach and bowels with the Pain-Killer clear. Should the diarrlnea and cramp continue, repeat the dose every fifteen minutes. In this way the dreadful scourge may be checked and the pat ient relieved in the course of a few hours. N. Ik?He sure and got the genuine article; and it is recommended by those who have used the Pain-Killcr for the cholera, that in extreme eases the patient take two (or more)teaspoonfuls instead of one.
