The election of Liuco|' fraaleped the critical day hia defeat could only peatpone }(. doat intend to aay that one section waa more to blame than the other whether both were equally at faaU, or whether tb» blame waa whofly on one aide.— Oruutnationa and recrimination* are no# naelew, nay da geroua. If poasible, the flrat thing done stiould be to restore the fraternal spirit which once existed. How shall this be done? By cheerfully and honestly assuring to every section ita just constitutional rights. Ho aectfen ought to ask more—none ought to suffer luaa. Aa to what are thoea constitutional rights, that ia a sokjeQf (o fcjf,considered in a spirit of confidence, mutual good will, "and devotion to the {Jtnion, for tha preservation of which my constituents are ready to make anv sacrifice that a reasona ble pan asks or an honorable man can grant, cooaiatontly with principle. In thia apirit Iaball i meet thia great question, and In doing ao shall I be auatainad by a a iijjmense majority of my 6on stituenta. If time Aall ahow 'I am wrong in this belief, I shall luatantly cease to represent them here. The people, under God, must save this nation, if it ia to be saved the poHticnna i cannot do it. What I may be willing to do, or the Senate be willing to do will avail nothing unSa^ suatained by tne intelligence and confi dence of the people. There ia a class df men North, nerhapa South, small in numi^er and influ ence, who aaanme that the preaent coAteat is a conflict of two oirilisatton^, freedom or slavery muat perish. The great body of those I repre sent do not thus believe. We believe there is no conflict of systems of labor In different States Incompatible with the peaceful existence of our Union. We believe the slave-holding nnd non slave-holding States may still revolve In harmonious spheres that if the question of sla very deKftsy-i the Union, it will be because the statesmen of the d*y are incompetent to. the task. After further debate by Messrs. Broirn, £ugh, Hale, and othera, the Senate adjourned. Hocat.—Mr. Hawkins gave addit:unal reasons why he hxd asked to be excused from serving on the Union Select Committee. Florida is a small State, bat nevertheless is entitled to all the rights and immunities of the other States. She cannot be forced to remain in the Union and the South era States are pledged to defend her in the event of attempted eoercion. He was aatisfied of the unanimity pervading that State to aeek redress of ita grieyai)oes4n its own way and means of other than Congressional compromises, which latter have never accomplished a successful pur pose. He regarded the component parts of the Committee as peculiarly unfortunate. He critl cised the composition of the Committee, espe cially objecting to Mr. Davis, of Maryland, as not a fit representative of that State, arguing that all who voted for Pennington as Speakci were disloyal to the rights of the South. He legretted that the resolution for the appointment of the Committee came from ope of the most gifted sons of the South He gave fair warning that Mississippi, Alaba ma, Florida,' Georgia and South Carolina were certain to secedeaud to be followed by Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. Mr. Vallandingham argued in favor of ex cusing Mr. Hawkins for the reason that the Conv iuiitee was raised with a view to pcace. We should not use coercion to make members serve. He adverted to the composition of the com mittee in condemnation, saving, there was no Democratic committee man from the great North West, which has such deep interest in the sub ject, and which dea not intend to be depend ent province, either of the East or Soutb. If the people of that section could not otherwise get to tlie sea they would pieaye their way with the sword. Mr. McClemand remarked that a troublesome future opens up before ua, but be did not believe our governo'enl can be dissolved hy the consent any one of its parties, there was more strength tj,e rtatl writHi uintructiotia in brji jf of both aid s, wa» am ized tuat the entire Dcmacracy of fortyrtwo in all, a nd aubmlt«||,the caae at tit ret government than is generally believed, t|ie oMH«k.to the Jury.

Mr. Sherman, from the Committee on Waya and Means, reported a hill, authorising tbe iaaue of ten million dollats worth ot treaeury notes of a denomination of not taw than one hundred dol lara. The faith of the United Statoe ia pledged for their redemption. The money is authorised to be borrowed from time to time as deemed ex pedient. The bill, after debate, waa passed without the question on Mr. Hawkin's request. Tbe House adjourned. Washington, Dee. 11. Houax.—Mr. Cobb, of Alabama, did not risa to make a speech, but to express an anxious de sire that the Select Committee should commence their business and present their de'iberations in soma tangible form. Hia hape,however,wea faint ae to any useful result. It Anything waa to be done to save his State, It mast be done st once. The election of delegates to the Statu Conven tion takes place on (lie 27th inst., and the Con vention meets on tt« 7th of January. What meanatheae crowded"" gal eries? riis answer was: The excitement which -pervades the pub lic mind, not only here, but throughout tbe en tire country—ill are looking to Congress to do something." He hoped the House would stop this debute, and do something, if possible, to produce harmony among the people. There was a pure beam of light From Boeton, which may ultimately have a good «ffhct on the public mind. Let the North ahow a returning aense of justice, nd leave the question which now agitates the country in thet!bands Of the people for proper adjustment. He trusted that the Committee would do lomethiug to harmonise tha distracted public. Mr. Leake. Alabama would not remain In tbe Confederacy longer than tbe 1Mb of Janu ary, unless something was speedily dost. He was not a secessionist. He desired pence, pred ion ted on the principles of tbe Constitution. If you can give us that, you can help uato remain in the Union aa ltag as the sun shall shine, and my prayer shall be sent forth for tbe perpetidty of this Government Mr. Davis, of Miss., briefly gave the reason why he should serve on the committee he might be blamed or cenaarad, but ia acting where hia eonacience approved, he deled the opinion of the world. Be stood hew not as the represen tative at his own preferences, but for the inter act of his constituents He regretted that tha laaalatiea aader, which the committee waa raised ream from dietiiyrishrd aaa of Virginia.

Mr. Curtia, wished to aay, hia party had not refhaed to diacuss he would do so at the pro per tiflto. He wanted the Committee, on which he waa a member, to hare a fair bearing. Mr. Smith, resuming, aaid he expected the op portunity would hare been presented of exhib iting the different views Of members, aa a meaa are of influence, and acting on the Committee, he wasanxfeuetoere every State participate In the deliberationa of the Committee, and hence, he could not excuse Mr. Hawkins, because if this Were done, Florida would be unrepresented. Mr, Burnett, explaining, said this Government ia not to be saved by mere eulogies on the Union, but by apeedy action. Mr. Smith reaumed. Xobody expected to eee force used to compel Mr. H. to serve, or desired to visit him with punishment other than that of mere opinien. The Senate is resolved not to serve on the committee. Let him refuse, hu» not make a request to be excuaed, with a private de termination not to perform his duty should the House refuse to excuse Mr. Bryce v a tie vote. Mr. Smith, of Vn., having been informed that Mr Hawkins aupposcd he had made some isiuua tions to hia prejudice^ disclaimed any aucb inten tion and spoke of the uprightness and integrity of the gentleman from Florida. Mr. Qawkini wa« understood to fee satisfied with tbe explanation. Mr. Morrill asked to be excused from serving on the Committee because of other duties which fully employed his time. Sxjiats.—The House bill to provide for the payment of outside Tressury Notes and author ise a loan, Ac., was takeii up, after some re marka from Mr. Rice against and Mr. Oowdoron in favor. On motion of Mr. Bice it waa refer red to the Committee on Finance. Tbe resolution in relation to tbe portion of the President's Mesasge in reference to secession was takeii up. Mr. Hale ofliired a resolution that the Commit tee on Military affairs be instructed to inquire whether the eipenses of that branch of the pub lic service cannot be reduced without detriment to the safety, and that, If they c*n,gtbey be fur xtyir Instructed to -report to what extent and what particular branch or branches can be dis pensed with or reduced. Tbe resolution waa aopted. Mr. Bigler then took the floor, having yielded it yesterday4pHe said he would go with tbe Sen ator from Illinois with men of every party who will devote themselves to tbe great work of res cuing the country from impending danger. Mr. President, for weal or woe, I am a Union man.— I am for Ae {Jnipn a| r,ia^e by our fathers. I am for tbe Constitution and ibe Union.. Mr. Bigler concluded th»t in Pennsylvania and Kew York there waa more votes than in all tbe States threatening accession. The Republican party haa gained ita last victory. Let us remain to gether. Mr. I verson said the South does not fear the operation of personal liberty bills, fugitive slave laws, &c. if they were all repealed, we fear the mob law most. It has been aaid that the amend ment will be made so thst a State may be sued for daihage fo tee umauut of the value of the slaves refused to b4 given op. Siich alaw is worthless. You cannot sue a State in its sover eign capaplty. The case cannot be brought into court The vote of the late Presidential contest shows the public sentiment at the North. All the Douglas Xou Intervention Squatter Sovereignty party in the North cannot avail.— [Laughter.] Under Black Republicanism the border slave States become a burthen. If the South is left to herself the slave popula tion will increase from four and a half to thirty millions. The slave population will preponder ate over the wliiile of the L'ort^. Washington, Dec. 11. The Democrats from tbe North West have had several conferences relative to the pic-sent condition of political afTairs. They generally take tbe position put forth in Messis. McCIer liand's and JVallandigham's speeches, yesterday, namely, that the Union cannot be dissolved peaceubl) that the North-West will under no circumstance* colisent to he cot off from t|e Gulf of Mexico and tlie City of New York that the Government, whatever may bo its faults, is of inestimable value. The leading idea is a Central Government, em bracing the uiidrilo, western and border Slave States, but depending for its consummation on Aiture circumstance?. Lieut Gen. Scott will arrive hero to-morrow [Times correspondence.] Mr. Trescott, bearer of the President's message to South Carolina, was also charged with the duty of consnltiog Jhc State authorities !o their purposes after the ordinance of secession was passed, lie returned Inst evening, and" re ports everything quiet, and no danger of a colli sion with the Federal Government. To-day the arrangement ia perfect, and things remain in tfaiu am until after the commission ers shall have faded to arrange for a peaceable separation. Secretary Cobb has at last resigned, but bis suceesaor haa not been nominuted, although ru mor saya differently. One report Is, that Mr. Guthrie has been named, and another is that Mr. Holt taken the Traaaury, and Hon. L. O. B. Branch tofcea the Poat Office department. Still anothar (an*or is that M& Sehell goes into the Cabinet Secretary Thompson will soon follow Mr. Cobb. He entered his ofHce to-day, but did nothing more than look over a few letters on bia table. Meaaanger from South Carolina arrived to-day, bringii the vote of that State for President ft.r tbe ensuing four years. Iks delivered the vote, and drew the pay for his services. [Herald correspondence.] Hfr. Buchanan baa tendered tlie office of Sec retary of treasury to Hr- Guthrie, Secretary of tbe Treasury under Preaident Pteree, and has accepted by telegraph.

The business of the Treasury was entirely sus pended to.day, as the Preeident did not cotmnis sior. Mr. Clayton, Mr. Cobb's assistant, to Bll tbe office temporarily, as heretofore.
