Satan w?i the fl?t I 'abolitionist, and freed Aduni and Eve from the ?"bondage of God;" und so the epithet "Satanic" belongs to the abolitionists alone. It charges IW with ?mnfttbizing with the rebels, and dls~ proves * ? i-avge by saying that wc have been, and are *n*., "at intervals," in favor of aboli tion ? tlie one statement being as true as the jfH or, and both being lies. It says we are ?-.rtioir for rev?* benefit, a war with England. Will it i/* nig the same chui^e agniuyt the Presi dent, who reiterates in bis Message oil* views upon the iibjeot, as we have often expressed ithem? Either the Hkjuld is loyal or the Presi dent Is a seees. ionist, and the Principia inay dioOMe its own horn of the dilemma. It says that we on 'Uiieed universal iibolition the Strongest weapon of the government; but it forgets to add that we said that, if this weapon were us?d, it would destroy not only the rebels, but the country, as Samson killed the PLilis- 1 tines and himself by pulling down the pillars of the temple. It concludes by stating that we. are in l'uvor of the halter or the prison for aboli tionists and rebels alike; and there it says? truly, and we gladly plead guilty to the charge. Yes, Mr. Goodell, we bold that you should join your co-dicunionists in Foit Lafayette; and, if our "talent of prophecy" has not deserted us. you shortly will, if you do not change your conr.-e. You aud "Cobbett" are a very pretty (>air of radicals, and ought to discuss your opinions of the HtnAMj in tie same cell. Such won'levni coifrjidtnoes of opinion deserve coin cidences also of confinement and banging. Anotiikk Stonk Fijelt ? Opkrations Against Chakulstox Fibdou. ? We publish this morning a map of the approaches to Charleston harbor. Which are about to be blocked up by vessel ?unk across its channels and inlets, in the same manne as the Ocracoke entrance to Albemarle boufci has been dealt with. For this purpose a tim wi old whaling vessels will leave New London in a few days, carrying upwards of six thousand tons of stone. The? will be sunk, with (heir cargoes, in the ship channel between Morris and Sullivan islands, and in the .Breach and Stouo inlets. This will be & quicker and tnore iiievi*<usive way of shutting up the harbor than by keeping a number of war ves-els before it hh a blockading force. whose vigilance the privateers could easily elude. Ik is, besides, the most Minging punishment that can be dealt out to that pestilent little city, which was (he first to raise the standard of rebellion, in the ?ain hope that its disloyal zeal would entitle it to become at once the capital and the great Comm.' rial emporium of the new confederacy. Instead of the brilliant future which it pictured to itself, it will find its harbor approaches bunged up like tho veriest rat holes, so that not even a lighter cau get through them to discharge the curg es sent it by its sympulhizere. When it was announced lhak the operations of the great naval expedition were to be directed against Port Royal and Savannah, con siderable disappointment was expressed that Charle-ton was not t<> come in for the first slmro of its attentions. It is better as it is. It would have given too much importance and grati. fioatiou to the cocks of the little dunghill State. T l ey will feel more keenly the fact of their city being wiped forever out of the list of commercial ports by a simp'e stroke of Secre tary Welles' pen, and that without the chance Of their firing a single shot in its defence. Such will also be the fate of Savannah and one or two othor Southern port? which counted that in this rebellion they would find a certain means of aggrandizing themselves at the ox penso of the North. It now depends entirely on the will of Northern men which shall be the future maritime emporiums of the South. And, unless the rebels speedily lay d wn their arms, it is a question whether they will retuiu any property at all in their own ports. The capture of the latter by the federalists will be followed by a larger influx of Yankee settlers ? a genus apt to stick wherever they swarm. Thus the chi valry will only have sunveded in transpi ring to their backs the blisters w hich their pride found so intolerable at the extremities. A1uj> for the vanity of human ex lactations. Tiie Mississippi ExraocnoM ami pre Drnnci L ties rr W.i.l IIavk to Encuwxtwl? 1 The idea of a great lund vu<l water expedition down the Mis sissippi river originated wi.b General Scott., and was one of his leading projects for sub duing the rebellion. At tirst preparations tn carry it out were in ide in secret, and it was contemplated, ad it was certainly desirable, to maintain that degree <>f -secrecy which would tend to make its success more certain. < >ne of the abolition papers of this city, however, ac tuated more by a saltish feeling th m by any re gard for the national cause, published whatever facts had coine to its knowledge on the subject, and the consequence was, as Communica ion between the Northern and Southern States was hardly interrupted at the time, tliat the rebels were put in possession of important informa tion. and immediately set to w >rk to interpose obstacles to the expedition, the fortifications that have since been e e :t.?d on every available bluff, from Memphis, t e in., to Ootiimbus. Ky. ? a distance of some three lui . idrod miles ? testify to their energy and resource^. and prove their determination to contest with us the pathway to the mouths of the Mississippi. The extent locality and armament of these fortifications thus raised by the rebels aie described in an article and a series of maps which we publish to-day, furnished to us by un observant and in telligent correspondent who has recently been over the whole ground and made notes of im portant point* The preparations for the expedition are being pressed forward at St. Louis and Cairo, (.en. Fremont is known to have devoted his almost exclusive attention to it, and now Gen. Halleck is continuing the work relating to the army while Commodore Foote is overseeing the con | struction and armament ot 'he gunboats and , transport vessels. The exact strength of the j land and river forces is as yet unknown; hut it I will b< commensurate with the magnitude of ' the undertaking aud with the serious character Of the obsitoles to be encountered. So far as we could be of service in pointing out where and what these obstacles are, we have per formed our duty in the premises. Cur descrip tion of tho fortifications, armament and robot forces may be relied upon as genet ally accu rate, anrl we hope that the information which we thus furnish will pi*>ve of <*reat utility to the commanders of the expedition. Tho period for starting upon it has not yet publicly trail - fired; but we presume that Secretary Seward may not be far astray this time when he says that in ten days wo shall have joyful news. Whether that news may be a grand and success ful movement of ottr army on the Potomac, or the sweeping r.wny tlie rey>el ob^*cl^?, ) our progress on the Mississippi, ftodthe occupa tion by our forces of the rebel city of Memphis, the country will have equal c*u.-e for rejoicing. If either of thedo movements be what Secretary Sew ar<l bintu nt, we trust he will prove to bo, for ouo* at least, a true prophet The President's Message and tiie Tht.e okath. ? The rapidity with which the Message of the President ? six columns in length ? was transmitted from Washington yesterday is truly wonderAil. It was f*ut over the wires in one hour ami thirty -twu minutes. Before the Ameri can Telegraph Company completed the improve, meats which they Lave introduced Into the nys tem which they control U took four or five hours to send on the sumo body of matter here. But it is not merely in point of rapidity, but of accu racy, that the company have improved upon the old method. Formerly, on an occasion of this .kind, when great speed was imperative, tbe mat ter transmitted was so full of errors that it took much time to correct it and place it accu rately before the public. Now the Message is delivered here almost as rapidly as U can be printed, and but very little correcting is required For all this we are indebted to the admirable organization and valuable lmpro\ements in in struments effected by the American Telegraph Company. The large capital which they have j invested in the penocting of .their system ha. I enabled them to accomplish wonders in a short ! space of time. Southern SuivHuunitHa. ? Notwithstanding .-vll the interdictions of communication between North and South, wo bave alieady seen between lift eon and twenty shinplasters of different denominations, issued for small sums, in various States of the rebel con federacy. We may therefore infer that tbey are exceedingly abundant down South, and that the statement in true that tbey are issued by nearly every corporation, bank, railway, hotel, barroom, eating hout<e and store' in Secessiondora. and in numbers tLat even ex ceed those of the worM days of I S3", when they were to be found in ne.irly every man's pocket. It used to be the boast of the so-called chivalry that pennies were altogether too insignificant for them to touch; but we have heard ou good authority that shinplusters for one and two cents are now current among them. We give below a copy of a twenty cent shin plaster which we have received from Port lloyal. It is issued by the Iiauk of South Caro lina, and printed on a fragment of an old twenty dollar bill of the Coturnorcial Bank of Macon, Georgia. Front the size it is evident that one of the original bills serves to make three shin plasters; and this affords a good instance of the shifts to which the chivalry are driven for paper: ? With such a monetary basis of operations, it is not difficult to cumulate how soon the con federacy under Jelf. J'avifl must cave in, finan cially as well as politically; (or what is war without the sinews, and what is paper without capital ? The end is not lar oil. THE
