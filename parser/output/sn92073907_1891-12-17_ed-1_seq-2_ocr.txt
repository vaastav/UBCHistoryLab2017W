THE IJEMOCllAT. HiLLIAKD Editor I'uh'i'died F-'ery Thursday. MIUKSDAY DEC. 17th. 1891. EntKKKI) AT THE POST-OFFICE AT SCOTLAND 'KCK, X. C, AS I si-:roxi) O.AS3 Matter. NOT SO HERE. Rarely if ever before in the history of the c ount, v, has there been a time when the proceeds of one day's labor, or the r .reduction of one farmed acre would purchase so large an amount of those t h , r. rr s that enter into the living of the inn-'-es of the people. President's Mes sage. Tli 1'resiiltni: in his message to Congre.-s dis-cusses the tariff law and the effects of the McKinley bill, liinl reaches the couchisiou which ve tin tj I. from Lis message above. V.ut the laboring classes can hardly see it as President Harrison ha.,- ut it- If they do, why is there .so much complaint fiom so many thousands of sources about bard timcfc? Why do the day laborers all over this land say in all earnest iie.-stliat they can scarcely live and aic really unable to pay their taxefc? Why do they say that they are com pelled to live harder and hauler every year in order to be able to make their hard-earned wages pay for the scanty meals they give then pooily clad families? These con stant complaints do not indicate that the "proceeds of one days labor" will purchase any fair supply of "those things that enter into the living of the masses of the people" Then, why do farmers of every grade throughout the land say that they aie compelled to curtail ex penses and reduce home luxuries, cvi-n wheu their lands produce most abundantly? Why does the large land owner say that he will be com- pHled to lessen his force and let part of his land grow up, or rent it out? Why does the small farmer who does must of his work himself say that be will have to sell his stock and enter into some other business? Why does the renter s iy that he mut not rent any rnoie, bat give up his .-lock and tools and work for monthly wages? These things do not look like ".he product of one farmed' icre" would pu: chase such an abu nt Hnpply of "those things that enter into the liviDg ol the masses of the pi'opie." Surely the President has not heard the cry of hard times that h is been so common amongst all :hsos of laborers and farmers for s ine two or thue years, or longer; an 1 if lie Las heard it, to be sure In h ts atuibut d it to the wrong cause. Vvaik out among the people in a di -guise, Mr. President, and try the world as a common laborer or iu I'ij-har.tied farmer a few weeks, and we think you will modify your srateiiient. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The President's message to the 2nd Congress wis quite long said to contain 10,000 words. We read it is nd learned some things that we either did net know before, or had escaped our notice. There was nothing remarkable in tin- paper, as we could see, either of particular wtakucss or special ability. Ali the papers do cot say as rnuci". Republican papers feel call ed upon, no doubt, to praise the President's message unstintedly simply because the President is a lepuidiciL; and democratic papers in ike prominent the fact of the want of ability displayed iu the rn.'s-age simply because the Presi dent is a republican. While we agree with him in many things we disagree in manv others. Important Meeting Dec. 29th. I.ditoh DiiMoc hat : At a meet irgof the Sctlar:d Neck Alliance on Nuy.
