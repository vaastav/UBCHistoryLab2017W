The_ Secretary ot the Interior reports satis factory improvement and progress in each of the several bureaus under the control of the ?Interior Department. They are all in excel lent cobdition. The work which in some of (hem for sora'o ytfar* has been in arrears, has been broni>bt down to a recent date, and in all the current business has been promptly dispatched. The policy which was adopted at the begin ning of this administration with regard to the management of the Indiana, bas been as suc INftlANS. j a r" lrminary step to the organization such a 'Territory it will be necessary to con B the Iodines now resident therein to farms ; proper eiio, which should be secured to tin in fee, and the residue to be used for arBettlnment of other friendly Indians.?

The ?e'eeipts tjTjpi all sources in tho land office ,atedto$3,218.i00. Duringsame period )16.S58 acres of the public lands were eyed, which added to the quantity before pyed. amounts to 583,364,780 acres, leav ? 1,257,683,628 acres of the public lands fcjiosurveyed. The reports from tho sub? ilinttes of tho land office contain interesting ormation in regard to their respective diB <013. They uniformly mention the fruitful is of the soil dnring the past season, and 8 increased yield of all kinds of produce. ?ven in those States and Territories where tuning is the principal business, agricultural vjbrodaets have exceeded the local demand, and -.?"liberal shipments have been made to distant gpfe. During the ygar ending September 30, ?'-1872.-there were issned from the patent office k. 13,626, patents, 233 extensions and 556 cer? tiScatcs and registers of trade-marks. During 'the same period 19,587 applications for pat enta,jncludint:reissues and designs, have been received and 3,100 cave|t? filed. The fees received daring the same period amounted to $700,954 '88', and the total expenditures to $623,'55>3'90', makins tho net receipts over the expenditure 3577,400 96. Since 1836 two hundred" thousand applications for patents have been filed, and about 133,000 patents is sued. The office is being conducted under the same laws and general organization as were adopted at its original inauguration, when only from one hundred to fivo hundred applications wero made per annum. Tho Commissioner shows that the offico has out grown the original plan, and that a new organ ization has become necessary. The subject was presented to Congress in a special com munication in February last, with my approval and the approval of the Secretaay of tho In terior, and tho suggestions contained in said communication were embodied in the bill that was reported to the House by the committee on patent* at the last session. The subject of the reorganization of the patent office, as con templated by the bill referred to, is one of such importance to the industrial interests of the country that I commend it to the atten tion of Coneress. The commissioner also treats the subject of the separftion of the Patent Office from the Department ot tho Interior. % This subject is also embraced in the bill heretofore referred to. Tho commissioner complains of the want of room for tho model gallery, and for tho working force and necessary files of the offico. It is impossible to transact the business of the office pronerly without more room in which to arrange files and drawings that must be con sulted hourly in tho transaction of business. The whole of tho Patent Offioo building will . goon ho needed, if it is not nlready, for tho accommodation of the business of the patent office. 

TKNSIOSS. Tho amonnt paid for pensions in tho last ftsoal year was 830,169.340. an amount larger by 83,708,434 than was paid during the pre ceding year. Of this amount 82,313,409 were paid under the act of Congrecs of Feb ruary 17, 1871, to survivors of the war of 1812. The aDnual increase of pensions by the legislation of Congress has more than kept pace wi'h the natural yearly losses from the rails. The act of Congress of June 8,1872, has added, an estimated amouut of ?750,000 per annum t> the rolls, without increasing the sumberof pensioners. We cannot, therefore, loook for any substantial decrease in the ei penditares of the department for some time to come, or so long as Congress continues to so ohange the rates of pensions. The whole number of soldiers enlisted in the war of the rebellion was 2,688^523. The total number of claims for invalid pensions is 176,000, being but six percent, of the whole number of enlisted men. The total number of claims on hand at the beginning of the year was 91,689; the number received du ring the year was 26,574 ; the number dis posed of was 89,179?making a net gain of 12,604. The number of claims now on file is 79.0S5. On the 30th of June, 1872, there were on the rolls the names of 95,495 invalid military pensioners, 113,518 widows, orphans and dependent relatives, making an aggregate of 208,923 army pensioners. At the same time there were on the rolls the names of 1, 449 navy pensioners, and 1,730 widows, or phans and dependent relatives, making the whole number of naval pensioners 3,179.? There have been received since the passage of the act to provide pensions fot the survi vors of the war of 1812, 36,551 applications prior to June 80,1872. Of these there were allowed during the last fiscal year 20,126 claims; 4,845 were rejected during the year, leaving 11,580 claims pending at that date. The number of pensions of all classes granted during the last fiscal year was 33,838. Du ring that period there were dropped from the rolls fbr various causes, 9,104 names, leaving a grand total of 232,229 pensioners on the Tolls on the 3 th of June, 1872. It is thought that the claims for pensions on account of the war of 1812, will mil be disposed of by the first of May, 1873. i^^iaesgpiated, that $30,480.000 will be re cwmnebdatfon should receive the early atten tat of Congress. The interval at present eitwligKcd bewtween the Federal census is so long that the information obtained at the de cennial periods as to tho material condition, wants and resources of the nation, is of little practical value after the expiration of the first half that period. It would probably obviate the constitutional provision regarding the decennial census, if a census taken in 1875 should bo divested of all political character, and no reapportionment of congressional representation be made under it. Such a census, coming as it would in the last ^year of the first century of our national exist ence, would furnish a noble monument of tho progress of the United States during that century. 

EDUCATION. The rapidly-increasing interest in educa tion is a most encouraging feature in the cur rent history of tho country, and it is no douht true that this is due, in a great measure, to the efforts of the bureau of eduoation. That office is continually receiving evidences which abundantly provo its efficiency from the vari ous institutions of learning and education of all kinds throuehout the country. The report of the commissioner contains a vast amount of educational details of great in terest. t The bill now ponding before Congress pro viding for tho oppropriatino of tho net pro ceeds of the sales of public lands for educa tional purposes, to aid tho States in tho gen eral education of tho rising generation, is a matter of such great importance to our real progress and is so unanimously approved by the leading friends of education that I com mend it to the favorable attention of Congress. TERRITORIES. Affairs in territories are generally satisfac tory. ^ Tho energy and business capacity of the pioneers who are setting on the vast do* mains, not yet incorporated into States, are keeping pace in internal 'improvements and civil government with the older communities. In but one of them, Utah, is the condition of affairs unsatisfactory, except so far as tho quiet of the citizen may be disturbed by real or imaginary danger of Indian hospitalities. It has seemed to be the policy of the legisla ture of Utah to evade all responsibility to the government of tho United States and even to hold a position in hostility to it. I recommend a careful revision of fhe present laws of the Territory by Congress, and the enactment of suoh a law, (the one pro posed in Congress at its last session for ins stanoe, or something similar to it,) as will secure peace, tho equality of all citizens bo fore the law, and the ultimate extinguishment of polygamy. Since the establishment of a territorial government for tho District of Co lumbia tho improvement of tho condition of the city of Washington and surroundings, and the increased prosperity of the citizens is ob servable to the most casual visitor. Tho na tion being a large owner of property in this city should bear with the citizens of the Dis trict its just share of the expense of these im provements. I recommend, therefore, an appropriation to reimburse the citizens for the work done by them along and in front of publio grounds during the past year, and liberal appropria tions in order that the improvement and em bellishment of tho publio buildings and grounds may keep pace with the improvements mado by territorial authorities. 

AGRICULTURE. Tho report of the Commissioner of Agri culture gives a very full and interesting ac count of the several divisions of that depart ment?the horticultural, agricultural, statisti cal, entomological and ohemical, and the ben efits conferred by each upon tho agricultural interests of tho cpuntry. The whole report is a complete history in detail of the workings of that department in all its branches, show ing the manner in which tho farmer, mer chant and miner is informed and the eitent to which he is aided in his pursuits. The commissionermakes one recommendation, that measures be taken by Congress to protect aDd induce the planting of forests, and suggests that no part of the public land should be dis posed of without the condition that one-tenth of it be reserved in timber, where it exists, and where it does not exist inducements should be offered for planting it. CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION. In accordance with the term, of the act of Con ress approved March J, 1871, provid ing lor the cele ration ol tho ono hundredth anniversary ot Amer ican independence, a commission has been orga nized consisting ol two members from each of the States and Territories. This commission has held two sessions, and has mado satisfactory progress in organization and in the initiatory steps necessary for carrying out the provisions of the act and (or *1?? the provisions of the act of June 1st, 1S7~, creating a Centennial Board of Finance. A preliminary report of progress has been re ceived from the presidentof the commission.and ia herewith transmitted. . 1* will be the duty or the commission at the com ing session to transmit a full report of progress made, and to lay before you the details relating to the exhibition of American and foreign arts, pro ducts and manufactures, which 6y the terms ofthe act is to he held nnder the auspices of the govern ment of the United States in the city oIPhiladelDhia. in the year 1876. The celebration will be looked forward to by American citizens with great interest ss marking a century of greater progress and prosperity than is recorded in thehistorvof any other nation, and as serving a further good purpose in bringing together on our soil people of all the commercial nations of the earth in a manner calculated to secure interna tional good feeling. 

CIVIL SERVICE, An earnest deaire baa been felt to correct abnaea which ttayegrown op in the civil aerviceof thecoun try, through the defective mode of making appoint menta to office. Heretofore federal office* have been regarded too much aa the toward of political servi cea. Under authority of Congress rules have been established to regulate the tenure of office and tbe mode of appointment*. Itcanuotbe expected that any system of rules can be entirely effective, and prove a perfect remedy for the existing evils, until tbev have been thoroaghly tested by actual practice, and amended according to the requirements of the service. During my term of office it shall be my earnest endeavor to ao apply the rulea aa to secure the greatest possible reform in the civil service^ of the government, but it will require tbe direct action of Congress to render the enforcement of tbe system binding upon my successors, and I hope that the experience of the past year, together with appro priate legislation by Congress, may reach a satis factory solution of this question, and secure to the public service for all time a practical method of ob taining faithful and efficient officers and employ ees. U. S. Grant. Kxecutive Mansion, December 2,,1872. ' Spirit flf JcfftKOit. Charlestons, Jefferson County, West Va. TUESDAY M0RX1X0. DECEMBER 10, 1812. INDUSTEIALSOGIETY. From a notice of the proceedings published in our local columns, it will be seen that the Industrial Society is to hold its next regular meeting on Friday next, at 2 o'clock, P. M. This is for the benefit of tbo people who live out of town. The farmer?", perhaps more than any;?tf?isjrof&!> of our citizens, feel the of a forward movement of some sort.? The negro labor, of which wo had quite an abundance after the war for a year or two, is gradually decreasing, and the exodns from the couuty is more apparent this fall than ever before. Problems of tbe knoltiest sort begin to stare our landholders in the face, and it is tolerably certain that it will no longer do to let ourselves drift with the current without mnkiog sorno effort to help ourselves, other than what has been already tried.? Some think that the tenant system will have to bo generally resorted to; and, indeed, some of our best farmers, we are informed, are buildiog new tenant houses with this idea. Whatever experience in this county teaches, it is certain that the tenant system in the na ture of things must be an inferior one ; it is equally certain that in all ages and countries it has proved itself a ruinous one. In a coun try where the tenant system is generally re sorted to, it is only a question of time how soon the most fertile regions will become un? productive barrens. Some men seem to think that our Valley land, like a cat, has nine lives ; but they forget that it has nine only. We say, then, a forward movement of some sort is necessary. The Industrial Society af fords an opportunity to make the experiment at least. There, gathered in council, the mcr,c power of collected experience may achieve something. The programme contemn plated, as shown by the subjects embraced in the spheres of the standiug committees, looks very muck like business. Let our farmers, then, come in on Friday and see for them selves, and not only farmers, but all classes of our citizens. The object of the association is to seek out ways and means to add to the general wealth of our county. To do this it proposes to de velope our resources in every practicable teat/. Discussion must of course precede actioo,and hence the preliminaries are to investigate and report upon, to present and consider, all tbo various projects for promoting our county in> terest'. And indeed we imagine that the mero physical good of our people will not alone bo considered. There are evils groater than poverty that need to be gotten rid of; and philanthropy could seek nothing more worthy of its best efforts, than how to give employ ment to those of us who for the want of it, must perforce grow into evil ways. For in stance, where this side of tho Cannibal islands is missionary labor more needed, than in cer tain mountain regions of our county ! And what missionary would be as efScient as he who would employ the people living there in gathering the rich treasures that may be found in the forests and caverns of our beautiful mountains ! 

FUNERAL OF HORACE GREELEY. Tbe funeral of Horace Greeley took plnoo in New York on Wednesday last, and is said to have been the most imposing ever accorded a privato citizen in this country. President Grant, Senator Henry Wilson, Minister Wash burne, Secretary of War Belknap, Senator Carl Schurz, Lyman Tremaiuo, Vice-Presi dent Colfax, Postmaster General Creswell, General Dix, Governor Morgan, General Sheridan, Governor llandolph, of Now Jer* soy, and other men of noto were present.? The corpse was borne by ten men ; next came the clergy, mourners and then the Tribune Association; next the Ilerald Club ; then fol> lowed in succession military and civio officers of tbe United States, located in this and ad joining cities ; officers of the government of the Slate of New York and of other States, now in this city ; the Mayors and members of tho Comniou Councils of Brooklyn,.Tersey City, Long Island City, Newark, Paterson, Elizabeth ; representatives from Philadelphia, Baltimore and other cities ; then came judges from all tho court*, aud a line of citizens of immense length. 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. As a matter of record, and in order that all of our subscribers may have the benefit of perusing the document and forming their own judgment in regard to its merits and demerits, we lay before our readers in this issue of the Spirit, the President's message in full. In this message, says the New York World, President Grant makes many recommenda tions, but they relate mainly to gathering up the tail ends of spent questions. The emerg ing, rising future has not dawned upon his obtuse mind. Ho has not the foresight to sow, ha has not the vigor to reap ; ho merely fol lows as a gleaner behind those who have put in the seed and gathered the harvest. There was never before such a collection of the odds and tail-enda of bygone subjects. Pub. Docs.?Senator Jno. W. Grantham, will nccept our thanks for additional public documents. OUB

In a recent speech Mr. Lowe, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, alluded to "that August assembly whose members are soattered through different quarters of the globe, and engaged I doubt not in destroying different classes of animals." Tho sporting instincts of tho Englishman penetrate the inermost fibres of his character : This great Parliament adjourned, thpugh probably for the first time, under protest of a minority, for tho great Derby Day. As the 5th of November has but just paBsed by, it may be well to note a few things respecting it as a grand holiday of olden times in Englaud. Its observance is fast dying out, and ere long it will only linger in a few remote rural districts. The reader of English his tory will remember it as tho anniversary of the escape of King James I. and the HouseB I of Parliament from the Gunpowder Plot.? Until within a few years back, the Churches of the Establishment were opened for thanks giving services upon this day, as they were lor a different purpose on the anniversary of ChaB. I. execution or martyrdom, let the studen t of history call it what ho iikes. Some will recall the flippant remark put into the mouth of the Oxford professor, by Mr. Disraeli in his Lothair, to tho effect that it would have been a good thing for England, if tho plot had succeeded and both King and Parliament have been blown sky-high. Such a catas^ trophe could only have staved off for a few Bhortyeare the mighty earthquake of revolu? tion, with which society in England had even then begun to bear. Till within two or three years back annual feuds were wont to take place between towns men and gownsmen at Oxford and Cambridge, owing to complications in the existing rela tions between the civio and academic author ities : the latter claiming the privilege of keep? ing order amongst those of their own body corporate. Your correspondent has seen the veritable dark lantern, seized upon the person of Guy Fawkes whilst prowling about tho cellars of Westminister Hull preparatory to the execution of hia diabolio programme.?

Viator Jkffersokeksis. The Congressional Election. The following is the full text of Senate bill No. 4, which has wonderfully stirred the ire of the Radical press throughout the State, and has at least this argument in favor of its passage : A Bill to extend the timo for ascertaining and certifying the result of the election held on the twenty-fourth day of October, 1872, for Representatives in the Congress of the United States. Whereas, It has been represented to the Legislature that in some of the counties of this State the Supervisors have failed or re fused to ascertaion the result of the election held on the twenty-fourth day of October, 1872, for Representatives in the Congress of the United States, and to certify the same as required by law ; therefore. Be it enactcd by the Legislature of ITfst Vinjinia : That in any county of this State in which the result of the election for Representatives in the Congress of the United States, held on the twenty-fourth day of October, 1872, has not been ascertained and determined by j the supervisors thereof, according to the Code of West Virginia, it shall be the duty of the I supervisors of such oouDty, to meet at tho court house thereof on or before the first d?y of December, 1872, and carefully and im partially ascertain the result of said election, and prepare and transmit to the Governor of the State certificates thereof, in all respects according to the provisions of said third chap ter of the Code; and the Governor shall there upon ascertain who were elected for Repre sentatives in the Congress of the United States at said election, and make proclamation thereof in the same manner and with like ef fect as if the result of said election had been ascertained and certified by the supervisors of tho several counties within tho timo hereto fore prescribed by law. 2. Any Supervisor who shall, without suf ficient cause, fail or refuse to perform any of the duties required by the preceding section, shall, in addition to any penalties which he may have already incurred, bo deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and. upon conviction, shall be fined not less than fifty nor more than two hundred dollars. 3. This act shall bo in force from and after its passage. Address of the National Democratic Committee. New York. December 3 ?The national democratic committee have'issued the follow ing : Ueartqiinrtrrs National Drmnrrnfic Cnm viitter., Now York December 3, 1S72.?The democratic national convention did, i.i July, 1872. with nn unanimity unprecedented in the history of the party, nominated as their candidate for the office of President of tho United States Horace Greeley, of New York. Six States cast their electoral vote for him at the Inte eleotion, and millions of men in the other States where we failed of success testi fied their appreciation of his noble character and the cjre.it services ho had rendered tho country by voting our electoral ticket. But Horace Greeley is dead, and the splen dor of the political victory achieved by his opponents is now diminished by sorrow which this sad event has cast upon the people whom he loved, and who regarded him as one of the best, truest and bravest of men. The les sons of his pare and blameless life wiil long remain impressed upon the age in which he lived. ? Every beat of his great heart was in sym pnthy with humanity in its broadest form.? He loved the government, he loved his fel low-men, and tho labors of his whole life were to elevate the condition of making. No struggle for liberty, oivil or religious, was ever made on the surface of tho earth since his manhood began with whioh he did not affectionately sympathize, and to which he failcjl to give faithful and powerful aid.? Every day of his life abounded with acts of kindness, of charity, of forgiveness and love Not his stricken family alone, but a stricken people sorrow for a loss so wholly inscrutable and almost unparalleled. The national democratic committee, in be half of a great party, who achieved honor by their faithful effort to elect him to the first office in the government, will do all in thoir power to honor his name and memory. Augustus Schei.l. Chm'n National Democratic Committee. iTST" The official vote of West Virginia in the Presidential electiou, oil the counties having been heard from except McDowell, is said to be as follows: For Grant, 32,323 ; for Greeky, 29,533 ; for O'Conor, 600. This shows a total of 62,456. Tho same counties cast in the State election in August 82,933 votes, or 20,477 more than we^p cast for elee* tors for President and Vice President of tho United States. Notwithstanding Grant's ma jority of 2790, he received 5454 votes less than were given for rejection of the new Con stitution, which was ratified by a majority of 4567.
