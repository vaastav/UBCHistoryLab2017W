THREE AVARS. Secretary- Root's Plan for Retiring: Certain Army Offlcera. WASHINGTON, Dec. 15. As Indicated In his annual report. Secretary Root has renewed his efforts to secure the retire ment, with an added grade, of the army officers who have participated In the three wars the rebellion, the Indian wars and the Spanish-American war. He has in this the active support of the President. In quiries have been directed to the Senate to ascertain whether the body would rat ify the nominations of a number of the Old war colonels who might be advanced to brigadlershlps through appointment of the two existing vacancies and immediate ly retired. If this line of action is ap proved one of the brigadlershlps would be kept permanently vacant to serve as an outlet for deserving colonels anxious to retire with an advanced grade. In the event that this effort falls the secretary of war has made arrangements to secure the passage of a general retire ment bill to fit such cases. There are 1S5 officers out of a total number of 3.S20 in the regular army who might be affected by this measure. The bill itself, which already has been forwarded to the chair men of he two military committees, is as follows: "Section 1. That any officer of the regu lar army now on the active list who served during the civil war prior to April 9. 1S5, otherwise than as a cadet at the Military Academy may, by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, be placed upon the retired list of the army with the rank and retired pay of one grade higher than that actually held by him at the time of his retirement, provided, that this section shall not be construed as cre ating or removing any rank not provided for by existing law and shall not apply to any officer whose length of service does not exceed thirty-five years or to any gen eral officer who has been advanced in rank since the thirtieth day of August, 1S0S (this is the date of the peace protocol.) Sec. 2. That the President of the United States is hereby authorized to select from the officers of the army, two major ffenerals on the active list and one major general on the retired list, who have ren dered distinguished services in independent command3 of great responsibility during the recent military operations and to ap point them, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to be lieutenant generals on the retired list with the pay and allowances established by law for of ficers of that grade on the retired list.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 16. Late advices received at the State Department from Its agents in Turkey show that they have not remitted their efforts to secure the release of Miss Stone and are again seeking to open up communication with the brigands, with probability of success.

' National Capital Xotes. WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.-The committee designated by the representatives of the two houses of Congress appointed to in vite Secretary Hay to deliver an address in honor of the memory of the late Presi dent McKinley called on the secretary to day and secured his consent to perform this distinguished service. Plans were being made on both sides of the House of Representatives to-day for the two-days debate on the Philippin tariff bill, which begins to-morrow. Each side will have four and one-half hours. A delegation consisting of Colonel Llew elln. Judge A. R. Fall, Captain Dame, Charles Spies, Solomon Luna, national committeemen, and Frank Hubbell, of New Mexico, to-day called on the President in ti e interest of the reappointment of Gov ernor Otero. The President told the dele gation that he would reappoint Governor Otero if a certain charge of a minor char acter was answered. This charge one of the members of the delegation was able to explain and when the delegation de parted it was with the practical assurance that Governor Otero would be reappointed. The nomination of Rrlg. Gen. George I. Gillespie as chief of engineers, as original- ever another ly sent to the Senate, limited the appoint ment to a term of four years. A further consideration of the subject satisfied the President and the secretary of war that the office of chief of engineers waa ex pressly exempted from the four-year detail clause of the army reorganization law. The nomination was thereupon withdrawn and a new one sent in by which the appoint ment of General Gillespie, if confirmed, will run until his statutory retirement. A bill was to-day Introduced in the Sen ate by Senator Nelson making unlawful the practice of inserting in bills of lading a provision for extra deck charges on goods to be shipped to foreign markets.

In the committee changes which will be announced in the Senate to-morrow it is understood Senator Beveridge will get a place on postofflce and post roads in ad dition to becoming chairman of the com mittee on territories. The latter Is a veiy desirable committee, giving the Junior Sen ator a handsome committee-room. Mr. Fairbanks, aside from retaining his chair manship of the committee on public build ings and grounds, will, In addition, get a place on foreign relations. This is an as signment of honor and distinction as it is the most prized of any committee in the Senate as it is from finance and ap propriations. 

ACTION AGAINST MARCONI SUIT TO rilKVE.NT FURTH Ell EXPEIL IMEXTS IX NEWFOUNDLAND. Telesrrapb Company Files It AVenth er Again Unpropltious for the Plans Laid by the Inventor. ST. JOHNS, N. F., Dec. 16. Owing to fog and rain Marconi was unable to swing his kites in midair to-day. He therefore went to Cape Spear to determine on the fitness of that promontory for the wire less telegraph station, which he proposes to erect. The inventor will use a mast 200 feet high, instead of kites, as giving more certain results. Being informed at Cape Spear by tele phone of the newspaper report that Thomas Edison discredited the announcement of signals having been received here last week from Cornwall, Slgnor Marconi . replied that the signals were received by himself and tha they were absolutely genuine. Further, Governor Boyle, at Marconi's re quest, has cabled the fact to King Edward. The inventor will give a special exhibition here at 11 a. m. to-morrow, to the Govern or, the Premier and a gathering of repre sentative citizens. Mr. Marconi will in augurate the new year by sending a special message over the Atlantic if the steamer on which he is to sail from New York reaches England in time. He will go di rect to Cornwall and take charge of mat ters there. Marconi Is amply satisfied with the rec ognition which the world accords to the new discovery. By midsummer he will have a fully-equipped station here for send ing and receiving messages between Amer ica and England, and another staUon on the Massachusetts coast. Marconi had poor luck at Cape Spear, where the weather was rendered extreme ly unpleasant by fog. wind and a rain storm, and the inventor was unable to decide upon a site for his proposed sta tion. He could not see the surrounding region and a general view of the physical features of the country in the vicinity is necessary before fixing upon a site. Mr. Marconi wishes to avoid the presence of a high hill behind the station. Hills in the background are detrimental to the system if they are in the line of transmission as they weaken the signals by causing a rebound. On returning here from Cape Spear Mar coni was served with legal documents from the solicitors of the Anglo-American Tele graph Company. These notify him that the said company possesses an exclusive monopoly of the telegraph business within Newfoundland and its dependencies, and demand that he cease his experiments and remove his apparatus fortwlth, otherwise the company will apply to the Supreme Court for an injunction restraining him from further trials. Marconi has not yet decided what course of action he will take in the matter, but he regards this action on the part of the Anglo-American Tele graph Company as the best proof of the importance of his new discovery. REVENGE OF A WOMAN. Shot the Manager of a Tea Company Because He Discharged Her. KANSAS CITY, Dec. 16. Mrs. Lulu W. Hockings shot B. R. Andrews, manager of a tea company, at his store in East Twelfth street to-day, because he had dis charged her. The woman fired three times. Two bullets took effect but neither is seri ous. Mrs. Hocking is under arrest. Mrs. Hocking first engaged Andrus in a discussion, then requested him to give her certain papers of hers that were in the safe and they repaired to the rear of the room. Andrus was about to take the papers from the safe when Mrs. Hocking drew a revolver from the folds of her dress. She held the weapon to his head and pulled the trigger, but the cartridge failed to explode. He then grappled with the woman and before he could disarm her received two minor wounds. Mrs. Hocking made no attempt to escape. At the' station she would .give no explana tion of her trouble with Andrus. Andrus said later: "I cannot assign any reason for Mrs. Hocking's act except that she was desperate at being thrown out of work. She and her husband disagreed frequently. Last Thursday the couple made up and signed an agreement which I have In my safe. This is the paper she asked for Just previous to the shooting." CAUSE OF LIVISH'S SUICIDE. Drooded Over the Possibility of Send ing His Predecessor to Prison. OTTUMWA, la., Dec. 16. George D. Du bose, until recently confidential bookkeeper of the Iowa and Illinois Coal Company, is accused of embezzling $1.700 from the com pany and is confined in the Detention Hos pital here suffering from smallpox. His ac cuser has committed suicide in Chicago. Dubose's alleged crime was discovered by Michael Livish. of Chicago, who came here three weeks ago to fill Dubose's position while Dubose was ill. One week after ar rival here Lavish claimed to have discov ered the alleged shortage and so reported to his employers. Brooding over the possi bility of the report sending Dubose to the penitentiary seems to have led Livish to resign, return to Chicago, and later to commit suicide. News that Livish had taken poison brought to light to-day the facts as to the alleged defalcation of Du bose, who Is under surveillance. He has not been arrested. Dubose's home is in South Carolina, where he has excellent connections. PROBABLY DROWNED. 'Lone Mariner" and His llrlde Have Been Missing Three 3Ionths. ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Dec. 16. Capt. William A. Andrews and his bride sailed from Young's pier on Sunday, Sept. 2$, In their thirteen-foot dory, the Dark Secret. They expected to touch at the Azores for fresh supplies of food and water and to land at some port in Spain or Portugal in from six to eight weeks time. On his for mer voyages across the Atlantic Captain Andrews frequently spoke passing vessels, and he was reported by them on their ar rival in port, but as the "Lone Mariner" and his bride have been gone now nearly three months, and as their landing has not been reported anywhere, it is the opinion here that they have been drowned. Quarantine at Honolulu. HONOLULU. Dec. 9. via San Francisco. Dec. 16 The battleship Wisconsin will leave here on the 12th inst. for Acapulco, Mexico. She Is now quarantined against the shore on account of reports of three cases of bubonic plague here during the month of November. ROSEBERY'S ADDRESS FORM Ell BRITISH LIBERAL LEADER IX THE ROLE OF TRIMMER. Talked Eloquently, lint Snld Little That AVonld Light the Pathway of His Divided Party. PLEA FOR UNITED ACTION BUT NO ADVICE AS TO HOW HAR MONY IS TO BE SECURED. "Get Together" the Meat of Ills Speech Quotation from President Roosevelt's Message. CHESTERFIELD, Eng., Dec. 16.-Lord Rosebery, the former Liberal premier, was accorded a great reception when he ap peared on the crowded platform here this evening. He said he had come by invita tion and did not wish to indulge In phrase ology, but to speak hl3 mind and offer the Liberals some dispassionate advice. The Liberal party, he continued, had passed through a long and trying- illness, but was now approaching convalescence, one of the signs of which was that it had got rid of the Irish alliance. The Lib eral party must now regain unity, though he would not advise Just how this should be done. Though Lord Rosebery's long expected and much-heralded speech was received with marked enthusiasm by an Immense crowd, it can hardly be said to have thrown much light along the pathway of the Liberal party. That the speech was a finished oratorical effort waa amply tes tified by the frequent applause with which the speaker was interrupted. But it is doubtful, when he finished, if his most admiring listener could have given any justification for his enthusiasm, save that it was Lord Rosebery. Solved into its elements, the speech mere ly said: "Get together." The speaker him self confessed that he did not pretend to say how this cohesion should be accom plished. In urging his fellow Liberals to reorganize Lord Rosebery quoted the fol lowing words from the message of Pres ident Roosevelt: "We hope to keep going by slow steps, not by bounds. We must keep our eyes on the stars, but we must also remember that our feet are on the ground." The following was the tenor of the former premier's speech: The ministry was wrong but the Liberals should be very careful how they tried to set it right. Turning from the immediate outbreak of the war. Lord Rosebery touched upon education, in which, he said. Great Britain was woefully behind her sister nations. Her commercial development was also sadly atrophied and the time would soon come when Britain would be forced to fight for trade su premacy. She would then be as helpless as though armed with bows and arrows. Lord Rosebery maintained a discreet vagueness on the question of his personal inclinations concerning the leadership of the Liberal party. He said that he could not imagine himself in the position of a minister. But in the next breath he told how he would reorganize the war office if it fell to his lot. He said this reor ganization, however, should be postponed until after the war. The speaker's recipe for the proposed reorganization of this of fice was a characteristically American one, namely, the appointment of a commission. Concerning the government's conduct of the war Lord Rosebery was severe and scornful. The complaint of the government that the Boers had not made war according to the recognized rules reminded him that the same thing had been said by the old Austrian generals of the young Napoleon when the latter was beating them. He was particularly sarcastic at the expense of tho explanation of Earl Halsbury, the lord chancellor, that "only a sort of warfare" was now going on, and he strongly con demned what he termed the scandalous misrepresentations by which the govern ment had precipitated the last general election. Lord Rosebery blamed the government for its tactlessness, which, he declared, had produced unparalleled ill will towards Great Britain in every European popula tion, and which he attributed largely to what he called the provocative oratory of Mr. Chamberlain, the colonial secretary. While he was emphatic on the necessity of vigorously prosecuting the war and ex pressing tho fullest confidence in Lord Kitchener, Lord Rosebery said that he thought the government should be pre pared to listen to peace overtures, and he contended there was nothing degrading or abasing in recognizing the exiled Boer gov ernment for the purpose of making peace. The three greatest civilians who nad waged war in tho past century, the speaker said, Pitt, Bismarck and Lincoln, had not dis dained such efforts to secure peace. ... 

PAPAL CONSISTORY." Leo Denounces Proposed Divorce Lane-Bishops Appointed. ROME, Dec. 16. At the consistory held this morning the Pope formally announced among others nominated to bishoprics, the names of the Rev. John J. O'Conner, as bishop of Newark, N. J., and Rev. William J. O'Connell, as bishop of Portland, Me. The consistory was especially interest ing as the Pope in an 'Impassioned address denounced the suggested divorce laws for Italy and appealed to the Italians not to allow such an evil to be Introduced in this country. The Pope declared that the example of other countries in the matter of divorce was criminal in so far as they recognized divorce. He prayed God to spare Italy from this social plague which, once ad mitted, spread like a conflagration. The pontiff declared that divorce was the moral ruin of woman. Grand Court JIarshnI Resigns. BERLIN, Dec. 16. Count Von Eulenberg, grand court marshal of Prussia and com mander of the First Division of infantry has resigned from the army. It is un derstood that Count Von Eulenburg's ac tion is a result of the Blaskowltz-Hllderand duel. This, together with the recent res ignation of General Von Alten, commander of another east Prussian Infantry division, Is taken to mean that Emperor William Is resolutely determined to suppress duel ing except under the most unusual cir cumstances. These forced retirements of German army officers of high rank have naturally excited lively discussion and also considerable disapproval in military circles. British War Ottlce Scored. WELLINGTON, N. Z., Dec. 16. The Premler, R. J. Soddon, addressing the New Zealand troops which have Just returned from South Africa, referred to-day in se vere terms to the British War Office and its attempts to snub the colonies. He said that if the colonials had been given a freer hand and had been leys bound by red tape the results would have been bet ter. Should the British army be required elsewhere, the Premier said. Canada and the other colonies could now easily finish the war. Nothing Left for Shareholders. LONDON, Dec. 16.
