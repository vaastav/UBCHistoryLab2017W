TR,IPLE SHEET The Railway World estimates that during the last eight years there has been an addi tion of at least 400,000 to the population of Texas, and that the assessed valuation of the property in the State has been increased during the same periodl $250,000,000. Texas would seem to be a good State for one or two New Orleans railroads to run into. Butler is to organize a new Democratic party on the basis of human rights. At least that is the rumor in New York. Ben finds no opening in the present organization, and seems to be tired of the Greenback crare. The new party is expected to pay particular attention to the bulldozing of white men in Massachusetts. The Bay State seems to be a great field for the promotion of "haman rights." Gen. Grant has again changed his plans. He evidently does not Intend to reach this country prematurely, and has decided to go to Asia before his return. This will delay the latter event a full year. He will probably land at Ban Francisco, after all, and that big reception will yet be in order. There is dan ger to Blaine and C(onkling in this change of programme. While he is absent the Grant movement continues to boom. HIls presence flght check it. The total number of votes cast in Missouri at the late election was 343,332, against 347,274 in 1876. Of the votes polled this year 185,171 were for Norton (Democrat), 96 994 for Denny (Republican), and 61,167 for Gilstrop (Green backer); the Democratic majority being 27,010 and the plurality 88,177. The Green back vote was drawn mainly from the Le publicans, that party losing 50,700 votes since 1876, while the Democrats lose only 14,480. Senator Conover's acquittal of the thefts imputed to him by Secretary Sherman, upon information from the secret service bureau, bids fair to be complete. The first day's see slon of the investigating committee was highly favorable to the Florida Senator. Un less the force of the testimony is broken by evidence on the other side, his vindication is sertain. As the matter now stands, he ap pears never to have had the Hot Springs bill in his possession, and to have not even the re anotest connection with the missing clause. The California Republicans are dlssatisfled with the lack of interest displayed by the ad mlnistration in the Chinese question. It was expected that the matter would be strongly presented in the annual message, and they confess to a great disappointment. Telegrams received at Washington give expression to this feeling, and the administration is plainly told that if it cannot do better the Repub licans will have small hope of carrying the State next fall. It is expected that M r. Hayes will yield to the iressure upon him and send in a special message upon the subject. The "kiss joke" ballots seem to be an old Radical dodgo. They were used tosuch effect in Florida in 1876 as to secure the declared majority for Hayes. This it the statement that comes from a high 'i'reasury oflicial at Washington, himself a beneficiary of his own fraud. The correspondent (If the Herald, who furnishes this information, fails to disclose the name of the official in question. The fact that he holds a lucrative position is sufficient to confirm his staAtement. If he stuffed the oballot boxes for Hayes he is morally certain to have a fat offhic. A higher claim upon the administration he could not have had. On Monday, the Senato will take up for con sideration the electoral bill presented by ienator Edmunds at the last session. The main feature of Mr. Edmunds' proposed change in the present method of counting the votes for l'resident and Vice President Is that the vote of no State can hI rejected without the concurrent action of the two Houses. Some action on the subject is gen erally admitted to be necessary, but it is doubtful if Mr. Edmunds' hill will pass. Any proposition coming from him will be closely scanned in the Democratic House should it get through the Senate. ills con nection with the Electoral Commission is too fresh in the public minud to cause any ex cees of confidence either in his motives or his bill. "Johnny" l)avenport has not yet tbx&n pro noted for his villainy in New York city on the fifth of November. 1( s..led the natural ization papers of four or live thousand lDemo erats, thus depriving them of their ballots, and by threats and force intimidated several thousand more. This action was based upon the assumption that naturalization papers Issued in 1868 were illegal, and all those hold ing them were seeking to cast fraudulent votes. One of the arrested parties was brought into court a few days ago, and almost as soon as the charge was read the judge or dered his discharge, on the ground that he had committed no offense against the law. Davenport's action in making these arrests was, therefore, grossly illegal. This will commend him to a fraudulent administration. and his early advancement may be confident ly looked for. "A Cholaw," writing to the 8t. Louis Re publican from the Indian Territory, gives an inaght into the manner In which the Indian anmmmo m laquladd at the wishes of the Indians relative to the establishment of a territorial form of government. He says that the committee paid little or no attention to the Indians proper, but took the testimony of such white men as they could find, whose views are directly opposed to those of the people who have given them shelter. The correspondent charges that the Patterson committee was in the interest of certain rail ro ue, which have receivld valuable grants of land from t nmnt the govrrnent in the event that the tribes iI)nsocntxel to) accept the form of govertnlent proposed, and that its report wou li be made to conform i the wishes oif these railroad land grabbelrs. The letter con iludes : If Congress would turn a deaf ear to the.e territorial jobbers, t here would lie no nedI oif Indian Inelegates at, Wnshtlngton, and c('oni. q oentlv tlhere would i(e no nfelt of the trans Iparentfilction of a crulltor charge ngainst, tire Indians of an improper expelindlturn of thelir schriiol funds, that a (inmmiittee may he gp pointedr to fritter away our patrimony Iby taking bogus testimony.

DEVENS' INSOLENOE. Mr. I)evens, of Massachusetts, who, hy the grace of Allunde .me, is discharging the du ties and absorbing the emoluments of the omffice of Attorney General of the United States, has made his annual report to COn gress, wherein he complains that the powers of his department are too limited and the processes of the Federal courts altogether Inadequate to admit of the efficient enforce ment of the revenue and election laws in the Southern States. Mr. Devens did not sue esu. so well in using the Federal election laws, through his paid supervisors and mar shals, to defraud and Intimidate the people tof South Carolina and Louisiana at the last election as he had used them in New York, andi he is unhappy ahout it. lle should have rememberedl that this sort of thing was new to the people of New York, but we have, hadl experience in such matters that proved val uable to us in this instance. Mr. Devens is evidently of the opinion that Phil. Sheridan's methods are tie mtost efli clent in dealing with the South, and he pro poses to engraft them upon the Federal statu tory law. He accoArdingly goes to tCongress with some very extraordinary propositions, which, were they acted upon, wor4hl enable Mr. I)evens to set up a new reconstruction programme of his own, scarcely less subvor sive of all local authority than that through which the South has just passed. lie declares that murder and perjury are crimes against the United States and not against the States, and if the jurisdiction in cases of persons ac cused thereof Is not taken from the State courts, that It will be impossible to enforce the Federal laws In the Southern States. lie then modestly announces that he has Inaugu rated a crusade against the Democratic voters of the South in tihe Interests of the Republican party, and that he ex pects Congress to vote him a defn clency fund to pay the spies and informers employed as supervisors at the last election to prepare perjured testimony for this pur pose, and to defray the costs of these pro ceedings. He finally tells Congress that he must have the use of the army -can't get altng without it, and that the act forbidding the use of the army as a posse comitatus must he repealed. Never before has an American Congress been submitted to such unmeasured insolence as Is contained In these three propo sitions. In regard to the first of them, Mr. Devens says, under the head of "Protection to Civil Officers," that additional provision should be made for the protection of the executive civil officers. "The punishment now attached to a resist ance to the process of the United States court," he says, 'Is not proportionate to the crime of murder, which, In freqluent Instances, has been committed upon deputy marshals, because they have arrested, or endieavored to arrest, violators of the law. It should not be left to the State to determine and enforce the penalty for an act against the exc ution of justice of such serious character, but appro priate legislation should enable the court. whose authority has been dflied, and whose faithful oflfcers have been killed, to adminis ter the penalty which the crime deserves. It is unfortunately too clear that if this duty be loeft to the courts of the States it cannot ie etxpatetid that in certain portilons of the Union it will now be faithfully and efllci`ntly per fornmed." rThiis all very startling (dotrino to Ameri cans. We have heard sorme such twaddle fromn Phil Sheridan, who prroitosHli to try the White League by drunm-hiad court-martial and sHIoot the "banditi" on the spot. From this ignorant and brutal swashbuckler noth ing Icetter was expret'il, anid his proposition otverrcame us Iy its laughabhle aIlsurdlty and without oulr special wond(er. Iuit we were not prepar.ed for such stufiT fnrom tihe lips of anr Amierlhan lawyer iilll'iently learned and prominent ito be r madle thie Attorney G(eneral of tlre Unitel States and the con-4itutlonal adviser of thet P'resident. We (io not know which of his statements are the most to be admired that the States are not competent to tdeal with such a grave offense as murder; or that other, that State courts cannot be expectedl to onvlct and pnnirh in such cases, and. therefore, they should be left to the jurisdiction of the Fed eral courts, which will di, so. Mr. Devens must have indicted this last recommendation in a moment of temporary aberration. It had passed,out of hls memory for the time being that trial by jury is a con stitutional right assured by the most solemn guaranties. He must have forgotten that a jury drawn from the vi,.inage must sit in all such cases, whether tried in a Federal or a State court. This,jury must pass upon the guilt or innocence of the accusei, and there is no other procdss known to American juris prudence of administering "the penalty which the crime deserves," whatsoever that crime may be. There is no reason why a jury com posed of citizens of the' same vicinage, if hon estly drawn, should discharge this duty more "faithfully and efficiently" in a Federal than in a State court. Unless the Federal judge be a paid executioner and hi:; court organized to convict, his rulings must be the same as those of the State judge upon all questions of technical procedure, and in accordance with the same great principles of the common law. Mr. Devens must have forgotten all these facts, as well as the great and enduring prin ciples which have given them a sanctity no American judge, legislator or executive dare to violate, for certainly h,, would not havethe audacity to go before the Congress of the United States and deliberately ask for their subversion as essential to the administration, through his department, of the Federal laws. Of course, the assumption that Mr. Devens had forgotten is purely hypothetical. He had not forgotten, and his proposition is simply that there is but one way to adminlister his construct;onof the Federal laws in the South, and to make them efficiently subserve his partlepn and vindictive purposes and ends, and that Is by vesting him with ar bitrary powers, supplying him with a full exchequer and lending him the mili tary arm of the government to| enforce his cruel and infamous mneasures. With these resourrs(' at his hands, and with martinet-' for judges and an army of paid Iilll nfrlers, as suredl immunity for their perjuriens by the Fereral government, and he will be prepared to inaugurate his inquisition ngainist the Sourth with some assuranLre orf s R sl('(''. ]hInt, ha Imuist have money to rio this; hti nmrust hlave the army, alsi, and anbove all thilngs, tihe State laws against murdrlr, perjury, inr'itingl riot., and such like crirmes, minst be arogated and the State rourts dlivestnl of all juriedlic tion ini sruch nasra. This is the nonstroill proposition that (coms from the first law offi car of tihe governmr nt the legal adviserI of the P'resident of the I'nlteal Stattes. It is not necessary to go into that portion of Mr. Devenfs' lur.uration which treats of the late eleetilons In the Srouth, or to repeat the blsl-curdlling recitals of cruel and cowardly murders, and tie persecutions to which his innocent purveyors of testimony in regard to them have teen sublmitted by indictments in the State courts for perjury. It is only necessary to say that Devens: advanres the remarkable doctrine that a perjurer is not amenable to the State law, and secures im munity for his crime by the mere e'irlum stanoe of having committed it beforr a Fed oral commissioner. Verily, thli is a now rsgis thrown aibout crime. l)evens believes yp it, though, and he asks ('ongress to provide some meth(od of transferring these Indictments for perjury from the Stato to Federal courts. Why not ask at once for soln methuod of transferrlng the gubrrnatorial power to the Unltred States marshal, and save compileations by transfer ring the whole State government at once to his department ? Why confine his suggestions to the judiciary department, and leaver the ex ecutive and legislative departments still to vex him ? Devens is too nlrdeni by far. We venture to observe, but with dilfllednce, that he might have profited and berm enabled to speak wiser in his generation by reflating upon a very wise observation that fell from the greatrer jurist who presides over the State Department, some time since, when he saidl, like a statesman, "It is useless and imprar ticalble t attemnpt to enform cr olnoxious laws. In any free enommunity, in opposition to pub lic sentiment." So long as the jury system p)revails, and is honestly administered, this trulth will prevail, whether the jury sit In a Feleral or a State court, and Mr. l)eveus ought to know it and thank Heaven that It is so. 

EASTERN TERMINUS OF THE TEXAS AND PACIFIO RAILWAY. If this road is to be built hy government aid, the eastern terminus should be Shrove port. Then, let private enterprise construct lines from New Orleans, Vicksburg, Memphis and such other points as may desire to con neet with it. So far as the Texas and Pacific Railway In Itself is concerned, it should not be permitted to exercise any influence for or against the I commercial or rival cities on the Mississippi and the Gulf. It being constructed by government aid, the road should be open and free alike to all who may desire to connect and transact business with It. We think Its projectors could not object to having a condition precedent to granting aid that the Texas and Pacitlf railway or its ofleers shall not own, lease, control or operate, or serve as officers or directors in any other railway connecting with thell'exasand I'aPific at any point in Loulsiana or Texas, and that the said Texas and Pacillc railway shall not place any one line connecting with it on more favorable terms than another in the transpor tation of freights and passengers to and from said connecting lines. It being what is claimed for it a great pub lic work that should recelve the fostering care of a government and aid from a national treasury, in which the whole people of the country have acommolln interest then all sec tions of the country desiring to u.9 it shouldl be placed, as far as may be practicable, upon an eu'llal fooling. By the present railway system St. llouis already clonnects I)y twot routes with the Texas and Pacille. Memphis is in connection with it by reason of its Memphis and Little Rock Railway; and the LouisvlvlI? and Nash le villRallroad, running fron thlt Mississippi to the Ohio river, places all p;larts of Ke n tueky, Indiana, Ohio and the Atlantic sea board in the North, in connection with it; the Memphis and Charloston Railroad, connect ing at Chattanooga with the railway system Âºof Tennessee, (norgia, Alabama, the (Caro linas and Virginia, places every State on tile Atlantic seaboard south of the l'otomac river in connection with it; and to-day the only two States south that are not, in connection with the Texas and Pacillic are Mississippi and Louislana. With the line of railway running from Vicksburg to Monroe extended to Shreveport, if the New Orleans and Pacillo line were built to Shreveport and Marshall, and the eastern terminus of the Texas and Pacitic lixed at Shreveport, every State south of the Ohio and Potomac woutld he in dlire.t conllec tlin with the Texas Paclflc road. This work being, as it were, a national un dertaking, should bte madet to promnotet as muchl as possible the interests of all sections of tile country, and the road should not be permitted to extend its line east of Shreve port, so that it could exercise no influence o detrimental to any particular section of the Southern States; but by terminating it at Shreveport and letting the lines h from the east and the northeast of the Missis sIppi, be constructed to an intersection with the Texas and Pacific by pri . vate enterprise New Orleans, Baton l Rouge, Natchez, Vicksburg, Mem phis, C(olumbus and dro will all occupy , fair and equal ground. competition for the trade and traffic of Tei " nd the West. We think it safe to that with energy i and activity on the p t her people New h Orleans will be able to co mand, owing to her position, a fair and liberal share of the traffic originating along the line of the Texas and Pacific road, as with the completion of the New Orleans Pacific Railroad to Shreveport and Marshall, she will be the nearest port to e tide water on the Atlantic coast. -e - - ie DR.
