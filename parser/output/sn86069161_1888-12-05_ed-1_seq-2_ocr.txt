resetted tbe pity early yes terday morning from bis home at Texa ami Mopped over at the Gait House to make tlte evening train lor Washington Mr Milts is aoeoni inuied by lfa wife who will tbe v iuler

4eed before tlte iwbiic In iry part of tbe country tite Courier Journal in eott idered tlte ablest edited uid beet of all tbe straight Democratic neHi tapeK eoneequeutly I ean to talk to you In tlte fitst plaee I reached my Lome in Texas on tlte Sunday before the election and I ftwttd that I bad ih1 lobt anything by leaving my caruitaicn in tbe Itattds of my friends ami taking tbe stump 1b behalf of tbe National DemoeratleeaHdtdatesaijd tbe platform upon whieh tkey stood for the suf frages of tbe Amerieau people Tlie prohibition movement has assumed in iueouftiderate proportions in Texas and my position jo regard to pro4iiWion was iksed against me by that party Tbe Republicans took advantage of Ibis circumstance and after working hard succeeded in uniting the Ilepubiteau Prohibition Greenback ami Labor witrrs agaioet me with all the other ihroatMled elemetilo Tbii was not enough Tbe proteeteti indt s ries wish ed to rebuke me for my oommittees lull ami retire me te private life and through tlte Kepubiiean party these industries toured money Into my dis trict which was freely wed in tlte at tempt to defeat me Two years ago my majority was 5MM but by absent ing utyaelf and by the combination of all tlie soreheads and disturbers I lost 5Wi votes and was elected by a majority of 5 300 I was worked bard duriag the cam paign and from speaking in the open air ki often I contracted a disease of tbe throat from whieh even yet I have not fully recovered I have been con stantly under tlte treatment of phy sician ami ltave not regained my strength Wlten I spoke in New Al bany I was a very ill man and tbe next speech I delivered was two days afterward in New York I was too rick to continue and was forced to leave the platform and refrain from any further efforts on tlte stump Jumping away from politics a mo ment seems as if the Texas heavens are weeping over the Democratic defeat It lias been raining heavily sinee the election wKh but little susehiue This hasinjifted the eotlon in Central and Ktsieru Texas a ltd tlte crop will be feltort folly gfteen ier eent Kentucky is my native State and consequently 1 lake a keen Interest In her pontics While the Democratic Presidential vote shows small falling off from that of 1SS4 1 am glad to bee that tlte Democrats have gained a Congressman and that the Republicans will have bttt two members from Ken tucky in the next nou I was born and reared in Elkton down in Todd county attu anuougn Texas is my I iKHue I never forget that I am a Ken luekian At the eleetioH Just over it was the misfortune of tlte Democratic party that tlte tariff issue was nut sooner brought before the people Tlie time was too short to edueate the voters up t H asd the question could not be fully discussed by the Democratic leaders or folly understood by tbe people Tbe people did not vote on the tariff and that issue has nothing 10 do with the defeat of Cleveland I make this state ment advisedly because in the thickly populated manufacturing centers the Democrats gained votes and lost ground In the Western ncricultural districts Money in In liana and tresohery in New York defeated Grover Cleveland the best President the coun try ever had and placed the Republi can party at tbe head of the nations affairs Indiana was flodeil with money and I understand the Republi cans etulni to have purchased 18000 floating voters nt prices ranging from a pint of whisky to SI00 This does not include tlie expenses of the campaign and SI 600060 would not be a small es timate to daee the money dumped by the llepuhltetui party into that State during tlte Campaign Treachery and tiiekery ami a traitorous swapping of vH in New York carried tlie day for tbe Republicans iu that State The Republicans did tint confine their brib ery Indiana but flooded all the doubt ful Conref shiiial dbiiiets or even those in u hieh tbe R riubtieau8 thought they had a thing chance for sueoes I am informed that some money was bent to Louisville and I know that money was freeli used in mine Of course I am disappointed over the result or the election and no one can poslbly feel ivowe than I do about it A Democratic is like a dog the more you beat him the better he gete and the Democrats have not yet given Hp tbe fight for priuciules and the rights of the masses against the de mands and encroachments of the class es The tariff issue will not be allow ed to sink into insignificance but front this time forward for tlie next four years it will be kept before the people There will be no slacking up from now on until tlie damnable system of mo nopoly Is torn out by the Toots No time will be lost and the tariff will be given to tlie people until they are edu cated up to it for their benefit this issue is put forward by tbe Democratic party We want them to thoroughly understand that it is the fight of Demo cracy with the people and the masses on one side and the Republicans the present system of monopolistic taxa tion aitd the classes on the other Sectionalism had much also to do with the defeat of the Democratic party There are some Southern meu on tite Ways and Means Committee and on this account a bitter and par tisan warfare was waged against Tariff Reform as reoomended by that bill Iu the East sectionalism is nut nearly so long prolonged or so bitter a3 it Is in the Western and Northwestern States Western Democrats are not that way but the Western Republicans are evi dently Mtprised that duriug President Clevelands Administration the Con federate capital was not again estab lished at Richmond That sectional feeling was thoroughly and complete tely stirred up in the Western States and was brought forward by these bit ter Republicans for all it was worth The Republicans thought a wluuiug card could be made by etirriug up bit terness and hate I eannot say anything about the probable public policy of Fresident elect Harrison I have not the honor of that Republican leaders acquaintance and consequently lam iu ignorance of what will le the course pursued in tlie South where are the existing race dif ferences attd troubles I cau say this ltowever that tbe Republican party will try to perpetuate itself in power and will stop at m means by which this end may be gained No revolu tionary methods will be too harh for the Administration to undertake in the South and we need not be surprised at any sectional measures or means used in tbe South IJefore the next Prestdental election in lfett there u ill be four more States of the Union gained by the admission of th Territories or Dakota Wyoming Montana and Washington These Slates will semi eight Senators to the United States Senate Of these Dakota and Washington Territory will send ltepublieans but if Wyoming and Montana get In tltey may prove doubt ful States as to their iKtlitics If tlte Republicans have a majority of one member iu Congress some meas ures will be adopted by which this ma jority will be increased to twelve or fifteen iu order that they might have a clear working advantage on all prty or financial questions and issues
