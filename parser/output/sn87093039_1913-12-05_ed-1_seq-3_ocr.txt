• f riday December 5 1913 Do Not Drink Is Our Advice If you can't get along entirely without it, then our advice is use the best and purest. It is the least harmful at least. We also advise you not to use tobacco. If you can not get along without either of these articles then, our advice is, use the best that can be had, and under no circumstances indulge your appetite to excess. To eat too much is injurious like wise. Do not eat too much. Our" wines and liquors, being pure and wholesome, are very ex cellent for cooking purposes. Than our cigars, none are better.

It would be indiscreet and presump j tuous in liny one to dogmatize upon so great and many sided a question, but I feel confident that common counsel will produce the results we must all desire. 

UPHOLDS ANTI-TRUST LAW. Recommends That It Be BuppJ«ment«d With More Explicit Legislation to Facilitate lt« Administration. Tuni from the farm to the world of business which centers in the city and lv the factory, and I think that all thoughtful observers will agree that the immediate service we owe the business communities of the country is to prevent private monopoly more effectually than it has yet been pre vented. I think it will be easily agreed that WB should let the Sherman anti trust law stand, unaltered, as it is, with its debatable ground about It but that we should as much as possi ble reduce the area of that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation, and should also supplement that great act by legislation which will not only clarify it but also facili tate lta administration and make It fairer to all concerned. No doubt we shall all wish, and the country will expect, this to be the centre] subject of our deliberations doling the present session, but it is a subject so man; sided and so deserv ins of careful and discriminating dis cussion that I shall take the liberty of addressing you upon It In a special messntre at a later date than this. It Is of capital importance that the busi ness men of this country should be re lieved "f all tinea Pintles of law with regard to their enterprises and invest ments and a clear path indicated which they can travel without anxiety. It is as Important that they should be relieved of embarrassment and set free to prosper ;is that private monop oly should be destroyed. The ways of action should be thrown wide open. 

FAVORS DIRECT ELECTIONS. Would Retain Conventions, Delegate* to Be Nominees For Office, Whose Duty It Would Be to Frame Plat forms. I turn to a subject which I hope can be handled promptly and without seri ous controversy of any kind. I mean the method of selecting nominees for tlie presidency of the United States. I tttil confident that I do not misinter pret the wishes or the expectations of the country when I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections through out the country at which the voters of the several parties may choose their nominees for the presidency without ihe intervention of nominating conven tions. 1 venture the suggestion that this legislation should provide for the retention of party conventions, but only for the purpose of declaring and accepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating the platforms of the parties, nnd I suggest that these con ventions should consist not of dele gates chosen for this single purpose, but of the nominees for congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the sen ate of the United States, the senators whose terms have not yet closed, the national committees and the candi dates for the presidency themselves, in order that platforms may be framed by those responsible to the people for carrying them Into effect. 

PHILIPPINE CONTROL Must Hold Ultimate Independence In View and Strive to Fit Filipino* For Self Government at Future Date. These are all matters of vital do mestic concern, and besides them, out side the charmed circle of our own na tional life In which our affections com mand us, as well as our consciences, there stand out our obligations toward our territories over sea. Here we are trustees. Porto Rico. Hawaii, the Phil ippines, are ours, indeed, but not ours to do what we please with. Such ter ritories, once regarded as mere posses sions, are no longer to be selfishly ex ploited: they are part of the domain of public conscience and of serviceable and enlightened statesmanship. We must administer them for the people who live in them and with the same sense of responsibility to them as toward our own people In our domestic affairs. No doubt wo shall success fully enough bind Porto Rico and the Hawaiian Islands to ourselves by ties of Justice and interest and affection, but the performance of our duty to ward the Philippines Is ■ more diffi cult and debatable matter. We can satisfy the obligations of generous jus tice toward the people of Porto Rico by giving the ample and familiar rights and privileges accorded our own citizens In our own territories and our obligations toward the people of Ha waii by perfecting the provisions for self government already granted them, but In the Philippines we must go fur ther. We must hold steadily In view their ultimate Independence, and we must move toward the time of that Independence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thoughtfully and permanently laid. Acting under the authority conferred nnpAine. president by congress^ lAave •Xbc sLcavenwortb JEcbCu nfrend.v accorded the people of the Is lands n majority In both houses of their legislative body by appointing five instead of four nntlve citizens to the membership of the commission. I believe that in this way we shall make I proof of their capacity in counsel and their sense of responsibility in the ex ercise of political power and that the success of this step will be sure to clear our view for the steps which are to follow. Step by step we should extend and perfect the system of self government In the Islands, making ti'st of them and modifying them as experience diacloMi their ■accesses find their failures; tliut we should more and more pot under the control of the native citizens of the archipelago the essential instruments of their life, their local instrumentali ties of government, their schools, all the common Interest! of their coinmu- | nltles and so by counsel and experience set up a government which all the world will see to be suitable to a peo ple whose affairs are tinder their own control. At lust, 1 hope and believe, we are beginning to gain the confidence of the Filipino peoples. By their counsel and experience, rather than by our own, we shall learn how best to serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our supervision. Let us once find the path and set out with firm and confident tread upon it, and wo shall not wander from it or linger upon it.
