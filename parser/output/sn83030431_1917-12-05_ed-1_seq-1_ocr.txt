To Meaj Thursday Night. Final action on the proposal of the majority of the police to "walk out" or "etrlke" was laid over for a special meeting to be held Thursday night. At this session leaders of the association said there may be an Immediate ceaaa- Hon of the greater portion 'of police work In 1'hlladelphla. The men, already, promised better paying positions in , nearby shipyards and munition fac- torles, said they would "turn In their badges and clubs within three-quarters of an hour after a general vote was recorded." More than MOO return post cards were addressed last evening to every member of the city'e Polio Department., On these the men were asaea to state how they- would stand In th event oi the threatened "strike.;' 'At th same time they are requested to attend a meeting open to all members who are prepared to register their vote dn the subject.

In this rrfove delegates of the Benevo lent Protective Association were urged to oppose at every station house the pen sion fund delegate nominees approved by the police administration! They were assured the defeats of the sergeants and lieutenants, who have heretofore held the majority vote In the fund, would be followed by a complete reorganisation of the pension system, and the name of either former Mayor Blankenburg, K. T. Stotesbury, Charles S. Calwell or Charles K. Blddle would be substituted in place of that of the Director of Public Safety. Imploring the men to place one of these four representative citlxens at th head ef the pension fund, Johns, the president, Mid: "We must hare a. man who Is npt controlled by politicians.

Johns then told of the charges made against him. He asserted a political leader in the Forty-sixth ward was the sponsor of the accusations, and Director Wilson dismissed him yesterday, morning after he learned of the proportions that the Benevolent Protective Association had assumed last month.

"How many of you are ready to swear .'ifsi'ince, loyally ana aevoiion 10 tnia movement?" nsked Hugh Creelman, a court tipstaff nnd a representative of the west Philadelphia Business Men' As sociation.

British Headquarters in France, Dec. 4. The great German counter of fensive here haB ceased. The enemy gained some ground and probably will get more, but he Is spending thousands of lives to win acres which we took without the loss of hundreds. On these terms he may continue to push and we may continue to give ground, but the great drive has missed Its end. One gets astounding pictures of te fighting from men who went through those amaxlng hours. One hears of ma chine gunners working their weapons until they became so hot thai they Jammed or until all their ammunition wa UBed' Then they sel,ed rlflM and , UCU UiUll W sasov . hot One hears of men firing steadily hour after hour, using three or four rifles In the course of the day until dusk came, and the atraln relaxed they put their heads down on their rifle butts and sobbed. One hears of Held guns firing as fast as they could at point blank range Into the masses of Germans as they came on until wave after wave of the enemy had melted nnd disappeared. At Gralncourt two of our tankri went around the 'village destroying the enemy positions and capturing two field guns. They kept command of the village until the British Infantry arrived. North of the Cambral road an enemy position was holding out when one of our tanks drove in and compelled the surrender of five officers and seventy-five men. A tank helped greatly In the capture of Bourlon Wood. At Cantalng tanks' stormed a strong position" and killed many Germans. Others went to Anncux ahead of the in fantry. One tank which was ditched was converted by Its crew Into a sta tionary fort and conducted a battle of Its own In which tha bodies on th ground showed It killed 100 Oermana in a section or trench. GERMAN ATTACK HALTED I.nll In FlRhtlnsc Reported From Cambral Sector. London. Dec 4. On the Cambral front In France both'sldes were taking a rest to-day bo far as the infantry wero concerned, although the artillery main tained a lively duel. Apparently four days of the most terrific hand to hand fighting of the war Is all the men could stand. The losses on both sides havo been enormous.- Berlin reports tho cap ture of more than S.000 prisoners and more than 100 guns In the whole Cam bral operation, and It In certain that the German losses were much heavier. The Associated Press correspondent at the front says that the Germans up. to noon to-day had not renewed their attempts of yesterday to smash the Brit ish front south of Marcolng. There has been no change In the re spective positions of the opposing force since last night. Exhaustion and the necessity of reorganizing his depleted ranks have undoubtedly forced the en emy to pause for a breathing spell. German Heavily Jlrrnforce-rt, Bringing up strong reenforcements the Germans yesterday renewed the but tie of Cambral In all Its former In tensity, although tho heavy lighting was limited to the southern side of the British salient and centred chiefly about La Vacquerle, tho point where the tier mans attained their greatest penetra tlon last week, and Marcolng, a few miles to the west of Masnlercs, which the British evacuated. The German pur pose appears to he to drive through the sides of thn salient at any cost and thus to compel Gen. Byng to aban don all that his forces gained In his great Cambral drive. , Advance In Dense Wave. In their stupendous efforts against La Vacquerle the Germans swept forward In dense waves, with absolutely no con cealment, and were slaughtered. During ' the afternoon they delivered a very heavy attack also west of Masnieres and succeeded in smashing through the British line, but an Immediate counter attack forced them to fall back.

Petroorad, Dec. 3. The Holshevlkl, despite the general belief that their ten ure of government Is precarious, and necessarily will be brief, have acquired some material advantages recently, not the least of which Is that they now have the sinews of war. ' Effort of the officials of the National Bank to defend Its coffers against the designs of the Government resulted In failure and the keys have been delivered to Commissioner Obolensky. The vaults of the Moscow branch, containing a gold reserve of 1300, OCO, 000, already are In the hands of the Bolshevik officials and other portions of the gold reserve deposited In branches In country towns U0UBtless wl" nt a similar fate. Trotsky Threaten Heprlsal.

It Is to be hoped, however, that the legitimate indignation aroused by these proceedings and still more by the ne gotiations with the Germans for an armistice will not give rise to a re taliatory policy on the part of the Allies, which would play Into the hands of their opponents here by adding to the complications of a situation which al though unsatisfactory should not be re garded as wholly compromised. Existence Still Precarious. It must be remembered that th pres ent Government has no. legal status and la far -from representing the voice of united flUMla. lu existence is still precarious. Practically all the more en lightened part of the Russian people sides with the Allies and opposes the policy of trafficking with the German military despotism. The results of the elections for the Constituent Assembly seem to Indicate the Inevitable reaction toward conservatism, or at least modera tion. Further, It must be remembered also that external pressure, such ns might Influence any other European Govern ment probably will be welcomed by the politicians her,' who aim to excite the masses, who care nothing for terri torial extension or even the integrity of Hussla, but who desire peace for tho purpose of prosecuting thlr war of the rlasees. In such circumstances nothing can be lost and much may be gained by a policy of patience. With regard to the Russians interned In Kngland their accession ta the ranks of the Bolsheviki would make no sensible dif ference In the situation. KILLING IS CONFIRMED.

As a -result of the President's message to-day Congress Will declare war on Austria probably before the end of the present week. Senator Martin, the majority leader, said that the Senate would be ready to pass the resolution on Friday. One resolution for a war declaration has been Introduced In the Senate.

Both Honaea for Speedy Action. The sentiment In both Houses, follow ing the request of the President for a wsr declaration against Austria, was almost unanimous that the present Is no time for quibbling and that war should be declared against Germany's chief ally as soon aa possible. Coupled with this sentiment however, waa the frank expression of wonder of Republicans and Democrats silk that the President did not Include TUfktr.and Bulgaria. They pointtt v tha Wat dent's address as confusing In this par iinii.r. he said that "one very em barrasslng obstacle" to the more efficient prosecution of the war waa the fact that "we are at var with Germany but not with h.r allies" and almost In the next breath asked that Congress declare war Austria alone, alnainr Lndce of Massachusetts, rank ing Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed dissatis faction with the exclusion of any of Germany's allies from the war declara tion and declared that he favored three declarations of war. He Intends to push this view in the committee and on tho floor of the Senate. Senator Borah of Idaho, a member of the same com mittee, denounced Turkey as the most malevolent nation In history nd the core of the troubles of Europe for cen turies. "I am entirely In accord with the President's demand for a declaration of war Against Austria-Hungary." the Senator said. "For my part 1 wish he had Included Turkey and Bulgaria In It.

The Senate will hjmr resolution new 1 eady to consider the war Friday." Too Idealistic, Say Smoot. Senator Smoot, Ilepubllcan. said he thought the President's discussion of re lations with Germany was "too Ideal istic." but adijedc "From the recom mendation of a state of war against Austria-Hungary to the end It was an American message."

Itepresentntlve Inroot of Wisconsin said : "There Is no doubt that Congress will declare war on Austria Immediately. The message from the President was nrobablv the best he has delivered, be cause It leaves no room for two convic tions of anything he said." Leaders In tho House were quoted as follow : SpeaVer Clark : "The present anoma lous situation with respect to aermnny and her allies Is perfectly demoralizing. Of course there ought to be a declaration of war against Austria, ana it ougnt to be against Turkey and Bulgaria too. It is ridiculous to fight one-half of the enemy and not the other half." Majority Leader Kltchln : "The Pres. Ident's message comes nearer reflecting the thought and sentiment of the Ameri can people than anything we have heard Bince the war began." Acting Minority Leader Olllctt: "I was very favorably Impressed with the message. I think it Is the best wo have heard from the President and I am In hearty accord with his views In gen eral." Senators expect unanimous action by the Foreign delations Committee on the war resolution. An unavailing fight acalnst It Is almost sure In the House Foreign Affairs Committee and on the floor of the House. ReDrcsentatlve Cooper of Wisconsin, ranking Republican of the House com mittee, who opposed war with Germany, la expected to try to block the measure, but he will lead a pitiful minority, If he has any support at all.

PUBLICITY ADDRESS TO ALL COUNTRIES Wilson's Exact Phrases Sent by Train, Phone, Tele graph, Cable and Wireless to World's Chief Cities and Airmen Will Drop Copies in Foes' Territory. President Wilson's message to Con gress' yesterday was heralded through out the world by the United States Gov ernment In what was probably the great est publicity feat ever undertaken. Dis tribution or the message was directed from New York by George Creel, chair man of the Committee on Public Infor mation, and nearly every known means of communication express train, tele phone, telegraph, wireless and subma rine cable was employed In transmit ting the address, translated Into. all of the principal languages of the world. Into practically every corner of the civ ilized globe. The Government undertook to see that the newspapers of all countries obtained exact copies of the message be cause of the fate of other highly Im rortant addresses and state documents. Heretofore there have been no govern meatal facilities provided for spreading them broadcast, and no pains had been taken to see that they reached the peo ple, of the world In the form In wrffch the President had delivered them. To overcome these difficulties and as sure the message reaching all the world In Its original form Mr. Creel made elaborate plans, which were carried out without a hitch by the use of thousands of telephone, telegraph and wireless operators, and by the employment of approximately 35,000 miles of telegraph cable wires. Mr. Creel received a copy of the message In New York by special messenger early yesterday. A corps of typists waa put to work In a locked room o make duplicate copies. Meanwhile. In another room, It was being translated Into French and Span ish. These rooms were guarded as a precaution against the contents of the message becoming 'public before the President had delivered It U. S.

Cisco, there to be relayed to Shanghai and thence to Tokto and Peking; across the Atlantic to London, where It was picked up and sent to the Continent, and down the eastern coast of tho United States to Panama, where It was retrans mitted to Central and South American oltles. At London and Paris the message had been placed In the hands of the estab lished commercial and governmental news agencies. From London a French translation was sent to Paris, and Lon don also served as a translation and re lay station for Stockholm, Chrlstlanla and The Hague, and also filed the mes sage to Algiers ana northern African points. From Stockholm a copy of the mes sage was sent to the. American Embassy at Petrograd. From Pari were served Lisbon. Madrid, Rome and Berne. New York sent the address. direct to South America, the most southern point being Rio de Janeiro, over the cable which runs by way of Chile and Colon. Colon relayed it to Bogota, Valparaiso, Quito and Lima. Lima In turn for warded It to La Paz and Valparaiso sent It to Santiago and Buenos Ayres. Colon was the point from which the message radiated throughout Central America. In the absence of news agencies with ex tensive connections In most parts of South nnd Central America, copies of the message were placed In the hands of American Ministers to those countries for Immediate release to newspapers and distributing organizations In their Juris dictions.

Few were pre- J Pared for such definite demands upon Gorman autocracy. Ambassador Juseer- and was so delighted with It that he called this afternoon at the White House to get an official copy of It. Particular Importance was attached ln diplomatic circles to the definite and con cise manner in which the President made victory over autocracy the one main ob ject of the Immediate future.

In this view, it was pointed out at sev eral embassies, the lYesldent is in ac cord with Brltlsli and French statesmen. The reference to Austria as a vassal of Germany coupled with the President's expressed desire to save tne Austrian peonlo from German domination was noted.

Wa8hinqton( Dec. 4. Victory flrst on the battle fields of Europe snd as a necessary step to this th Inclusion at once of Austria among America's enemies this was the fighting message delivered by President Wilson to-day to the Congress assembled for th first time In Joint session since the war be gan. Next to his adjuration to the nation to fight on till victory was won, no por tion of to-day's address stirred his hear ers more than this delimitation of the peace alms not war alms of America. It was evident to nil that the Presi dent had framed his message In the hope that It might penetrate behind the enemy's battle fronts and arouse the forces of liberalism, in the Central Em pires to break off their chains. Ar rangements had been made In advance to transmit the message to virtually every Government In the world. Epitomized the conditions upon which the war must now be carried on accord ing to the President are: An Immediate declaration of war against Austria-Hungary. Victory to be the sole object of Im mediate consideration. No compromise with autocracy. No thought of premature peace. Demand that the present Hohen zollern Government go.

" """"0 DI one 01 ,n0 'eaemg ng. urcs in in e war. The President spoke as follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: Eight months have elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of Immense and grave signifi cance for us. I shall not undertake to retail or even to summarize those events. The practical particulars of the part wo have played In them will be laid before you In the reports of the executive departments. I shall dis cuss only' our present outlook upon ' these vast affairs, our present duties nnd the immediate means of accom plishing tho objects we shall hold al ways In view. , I shall not go hack to debnto the causes of tho war. The Intolerable wrongs dono and planned against us by the sinister masters of Ocrmany havo long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true American to need to be rehearsed. But I hhall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny our objectives and the measures by which we mean to attain them : for the pur pn.n of dlsciissirm hero in this place Is action nnd our action must move ttralght toward definite ends. Our object is, of course, to win the war and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to be diverted until It I won. But It Is worth while asking and answering the qqestlon, When shall w consider the war won? United In Spirit and Intent. . From one point of view It Is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the Amer ican people know what tho war Is about nnd whnt sort of nn outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose In It. As a nation we are united in spirit nnd Intention. I pay llttlo heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dissent who does not? I hear the criticism and tho clamor of tho. noisily thought less and troublesome. I also rco men hero and there fling themselves In Impotent disloyalty against the calm. Indomitable )ower of the nation. I hear men dehato peace who under stand neither Its nature nor the way ln which wc may nttaln It with up lifted eyes and unbroken spirits. Hut I know that' none of these (.peak for the nation. They do not touch tho heart of anything, They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour und bo forgotten. Hut from another point of view I believe that It Is necessary to say plainly what we here nt tho sent of action consider tho war to lie for and whnt part we mean to play in the settlement of ltn searching Issues. We nro the spokesmen of the Ameri can people and they hao a right to know whether their purpose Is ours. They desire peaco by the overcoming of evil, by the defeat once for all of the slnlHter forces that Interrupt peace nnil rentier It Impossible nnd they wish to know how closely our thought runs with theirs mid wh.it action we pro pose. They lire Impatient with thoo who desire peace by nny sort of com promise deeply nnd Indignantly Im patient hut they will lw equally Im patient with us If we do not make It plain to them what our objectives am and what wo are planning for In
