2 CONTROVERSY CAUSES GOSSIP HENEY AND BURNS MAY BE SUBPOENAED PROSECUTOR AND SLEUTH EX PECTED AT CAPITAL President's Object In Starting Secret Service Wrangle Said to Be to Improve Department's Uses iCoDtlaueil from Face One) accept the portfolio of secretary of state in the Taft cabinet. ' There will be a general scramble be tween prominent Jt-epUoUcans of Penn sylvania tor Mr. Knox s seat which will cause public interest in the con test going on now in Ohio for the seat of Senator Foraker and in Connecticut for the seat of senator Brandegee. The Republican senators whose terms expire at the end of the present con gress, but who are sure of being re turned, are Cummins of lowa, now serving out the unexpired term of the late Senator Allison: Dillingham of Vermont, Gallinger of New Hampshire, Heyburn of Idaho, Hopkins of Illinois, Penrose of Pennsylvania, Perkins of California Smoot of Utah and Stephens of Wisconsin. . Democratic, senators who will be re turned are Clark of Arkansas. Gore of Oklahoma, Johnson of Alabama. Mc- Knery of Louisiana, Newlands of Ne vada, Overman of North Carolina. Smith of Maryland, Stone of Missouri and Clay of Georgia. Successors for Four ' By reason of defeat in primary con tests Senator Ankeny of Washington will be succeeded by Representative Wesley L. Jones. Hunsborough of North Dakota by M. N. Johnson, Klttredge of South Dakota by Governor C. I. Craw ford and Long of Kansas by Joseph Bristow, former fourth assistant post master general. All of these men are Republicans, and in addition Fulton of Oregon probably will be succeeded by Governor Chamberlain, Democrat, who was victorious in what is popularly j known as the double primary system of the state. .', If pledges made by certain members "i the Oregon legislature are kept Chamberlain will come to the senate, but if they are violated, as many lead ing Republicans of the state are de manding, it is possible, in fact probable, that Fulton will be. chosen to succeed himself. Of ihe Democratic senators whose terms expire on March 4, Gary of South Carolina will be succeeded by K. D. Smith and Milton of Florida by Duncan U. Fletcher, both of the In cumbents having declined to be can dates for re-election. * • Offsetting the Oregon situation is that Of Kentucky, where former Governor XV. O. Bradley, Republican, has been elected to succeed McCreary, Democrat, by reason of the failure of the Demo cratic majority in the Kentucky legis lature to agree. - Teller of Colorado will be succeeded by Charles J. Hughes, who was In dorsed by the Democratic state com mittee after Teller had declined to be a candidate for re-election. The legis lature ls Democratic and Hughes will be elected. Contests have narrowed down to Ohio, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Indiana. In the latter state a Democrat will be elected to succeed Hemenway, the legis lature having been lost by the Republi cans in the recent election. . The eyes of the country are on Ohio because of the candidacy of Charles P. Taft, brother of the president- elect, for the seat of Foraker, one of the most vigorous and picturesque characters in the senate and one who has declined to abandon his place without a fight. One Powerful Aid The relationship between Mr. Taft and the president-elect and the fact that the Cincinnati editor has been prominent in the councils of the Repub lican party in Ohio for many years are powerful factors in the contest ho is waging for the senatorial toga. The forces opposed to Mr. Taft's elec tion, including as they do Foraker, Representative Burton, who placed Mr. Taft in nomination for the presidency and who has been recognized as one of his principal supporters; Harry M. Daugherty and former Speaker Kelfer, must be reckoned with, especially if there should be a combination effected by the forces led by Senators Foraker and i Dick and the members of the legislature friendly to Burton. -Without such an alliance, the indica tions are that Mr. Taft would go Into the fight In the lead, but astute poli ticians declare they would not be sur prised to see Foraker withdraw in favor of Burton. At the present time the result must be conceded to be in doubt. ~ • •-.■..... The official announcement that there is to be a vacancy in Pennsylvania through the resignation of Knox is of too recent date to permit of the lining up of aspirants for the Keystone sena torship. Already, however, there have ap peared in the field as probable candi dates Representatives James Francis Burke and John Dalzell and George E.; Oliver, all of Pittsburg. For many years it has been the recognized policy in Pennsylvania to take one senator from the eastern and one from the western half of the state. . :< Several names have been mentioned in Connecticut for the seat now occu pied by Brandegee, and Representative Hill formally announced his candidacy Rome time ago. The legislature will de cide the contest, and it is conceded to be close. Not tho least interesting of the sen atorial fights ts in Indiana. Chief among the aspirants are John W. Kern, candidate for vice president on the Democratic ticket; John E. Lamb of Terre Haute, former Representative B. F. Shlvely of South Bend and L. E. Slack of Franklin. i . . That Mr. Kern has more members in , the legislature pledged to his support .than any other of the candidates is con ; ceded, but it Is recognized also that his pledges aro still short of the number needed to elect. -■■ No movement to unite against Kern is yet In evidence, and It is probable he could be elected. Heney May Be Summoned '• There is a ' well-defined rumor in White House circles that Francis J. Heney, the noted graft prosecutor, who has gained considerable distinction in : San Francisco, and who recently was assassinated there by Morris Haas, will be summoned to the national capi tal, with his assistant, Secret Service Agent William J. Burns, to > answer questions before the special committee appointed by the senate to Investigate the president's language in connection with the secret service appointments.

There was much criticism at the time the president ordered Detective Burns to San Franaisco, on the ground that there was no reliable way of knowing what the long graft prosecution has cost the people, as the expenses are drawn from the secret service fund and are not matters of public record. Representative Perkins of New York is chairman of the special house com mittee to consider the statement in the president's message concerning the law which denies the treasury department the right to tend secret service men to other departments to uncover crimes against the government. Representative Perkins called for the appointment of the committee.

RENDER DECISION IN SUGAR REBATE CASE COMMERCE COMMISSIONERS INTERPRET LAW Allowances for Transfer from/ Re fineries to Train Declared to Be * Form of Refund Violating the Statutes WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.—1n a de cision made public today, the interstate commerce commission declares that al lowances for the transfer of sugar from refineries to the trains are essentially rebates and In violation of the law. This Important determination was reached by the commission only after several months of consideration of the matter of allowances for the transfer of sugar, and so far as the commission ls concerned brings to an end a con troversy which has long existed be tween the refineries in New York and those in Philadelphia. The Investigation of the subject was begun by the commission on its own initiative. In its decision the commis sion lays down four general conclusions as follows . "1. The commission has Jurisdiction to make an order in 'any Inquiry on its motion ln the same manner and to the same effect as though complaint has been made.' "2. It is not a part, of the carriers* duty to bear the expense of transfer of goods from the shipper to the carrier For carriers to undertake to compen sate shippers for performing services which the shippers are legally bound to do for themselves is for the carriers to violate the act. "3. The publication of gross and net rates would needlessly add to the com plexity of tariffs. Wherever It is pos sible for carriers to file a' net rate as such It is their duty to do so. "4. The allowances here considered are rebates and violate the law. No order is issued. but the carriers are ex pected to conform to the law without delay." i It was disclosed that the payment at present in New York of 2 cents a hun dred pounds to the shippers as cartage was really in the nature of a rebate from the through rate fixed by the rail roads on shipments of sugar. The allowances or rebates in one form or another have been in vogue since 1885 and they range from the present allowance of 2 cents a hundred pounds to as high as 4% cents a hundred pounds.

STRANGE METEOR SEEN BY CROWDS PHENOMENAL LIGHT WAVES LONG OVER MISSOURI . DROPS IN KANSAS, LEAVING ODD STREAK BEHIND IT Remarkable Object Viewed by Hun dreds In St. Joseph, Wichita and Salina —Fades Away Gradually ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Dec. 20.—The strangest meteor ever seen in this part of the country fell from the skies be tween 6 and 6 o'clock this afternoon, and was seen by several hundred per sons here. The meteor seemed to drop somewhere west of here, probably in Kansas. Ii had the appearance of a ball of Are about the size of a street lamp. The tail or stream of sparks was several feet in length. The meteor was visible about thirty seconds. A peculiar white streak, re garded as a phenomenon which the meteor seemed to leave behind it as a path, was visible for fifteen minutes. It seemed to waver in Its course, as if blown by the wind, and gradually faded from sight. Wichita and Salina, Kas.. report see ing the meteor tonight. At Wichita the attention of persons outdoors was attracted by a sudden flash of light. « It was thought the meteor fell to the northeast of that place. Persons sit Salina report having seen two meteors at about the same hour. ANXIOUS FOR PLACE ON TAET'S SLATE (Continued from Pase One) tainty that in addition to these named i ! Secretary Wilson will continue for a ■ year or more as the head of the agrl i cultural department; that Secretary ' Garfield will retire from the cabinet; that Judge Richard A. Ballinger of Se attle will be given a place, probably that of secretary of the interior; that Luke E. Wright will retire from the cabinet and again take a post in the i diplomatic' service, and that an Ohio man will be given the position of secre tary of the treasury. y Within the last few days the namo of Charles Nagel of Missouri has been discussed in connection with the secre , taryship of the department of com merce and labor. It is known that at one time Mr. Taft thought very strongly of naming Nagel as attorney general, but that ■ later he considered Wickersham more adaptable to the purpose of that de partment. Once Favored Nagel He said, however, that he would like 1 an able lawyer to head the department of commerce and labor. Republican politicians are urging the claims of Missouri for recognition and as Judge Nagel played a prominent part ln the campaign as a member of the execu tive committee of the Republican na tional committee, the mantle would fall 1 upon him naturally if a place is given to that state. "j Other names heard in connection with that department are those of William ; Loeb, jr., secretary to President Roose velt; Oscar S. Straus, who now has a ! portfolio; and George A. Knight of 1 California. It is not believed here, however, that two places will go to the Pacific coast. i Probably the most difficult place re -1 maining to be filled is that of secretary of the treasury. Among those men 1 mentioned are former Governor Myron T. Herrick and Representative Burton. For secretary of war Charles Magoon, now governor of Cuba, la hoard of fre quently, but the generally accepted Idea is that Mr. Taft has not yot made up his mind whom to appoint. He is said i to be looking for a man who has made a record as a business man. William Doeb, Jr., Is also mentioned for secretary of the navy, as also is 1 Charles H. Thompson of New York. There are some close friends of Mr. Taft also who think that Secretary Newberry will be retained. Curry Seeks Statehood 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.— "W0 have a wideawake, progressive, industrial and intelligent population and we want ' to be treated like men." In these words, Governor George Curry of New Mexico asks stateho6d for his territory in his annual report to the secretary of the interior made public today. Gov -1 ernor Curry says New Mexico's credit is excellent, that no strikes mar the record of its industries; the laws en acted by its legislature are good, gambling is prohibited and the "Sunday ' closing" rigorously enforced. So, he says, New Mexico"deserves statehood. TAFT AND HIS WIFE HEAR SERMON ON TEMPERANCE AUGUSTA, Ga., Dec. 20.—President elect and Mrs. William H. Taft at tended services today at Rt.

The laxity of enforcing the state prohibition laws of Georgia is given as the cause of the crusade in Augusta. Dr. Whitney frankly admitted the law to be "bad in part, drastic and In some respects fanatical." "Neverthe less," he said, "it ls the law and ought to be obeyed. If it is a bad law its rigid enforcement is the surest means of getting , it repealed or amended." The president-elect said tonight his cabinet had acquired no additional members since the Knox announce ment; no enters of positions were pending, nor had he made any decis ions with respect to making offers.

FIRE MARSHAL-CHARGES BOLD ATTEMPT AT ARSON SAN FRANCISCO, Dee. 20.—What City Fire Marshal Towe declared to be the most daring attempt at arson he has ever been called upon to fight developed early this morning when a kerosene saturated heap of straw and other inflammable rubbish with a lighted candle burning in it was dis covered in a back passageway of the Van Ness avenue establishment of the Rosenthal Shoe company.
