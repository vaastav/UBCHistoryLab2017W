President Cleveland's last annual message to Congress is a lengthy one, yet it is characteristic of the man It deals in a straightforward manner witlt many public questions of great import. He does not modify his position on the tariff question nor does he dispairof the ultimate triumph of the principles of tariff reduction. The President enters a strong pro test against the idea that claims houlJ be allowed that are "support ed no better consideration than the wealth of the Government and the poverty of the claimants," and he insists that public needs and neces sities should be the criterion of ex penditures on public buildings and other improvements. . Belief to the overcrowded business of the Supreme Court ; la ws to prevent the spoliation of public lands and their diversion to other uses than that of homes for honest settlers; further reform in Indian adminis tration; tbe erection of Federal prisons for United States convicts and of Post Office building at the National Capital are among the min or recommendations of general in terest That private or local interests should not prevail against the public good is Cleveland's theorem, which he undertakes to illustrates not only by his argument about tax and tar iff, but also by his rigorous conten tion for the substitution of general for special legislation at a time when "front century's height we view tbe war already trod by the Amen can people and attempt to discover their future path," The foresha dowing of such a progress Cleve land discerns in the declaration of Andrew Jackson for "a plain ay tern, devoid of pomp, protecting a! and granting favors to none." , Our foreign relations are disposed of by the statement that all pend ing difficulties are capable of satis factory adjustment. Nothing is added to the expieasious of former messages respecting Canadian or British questions, excepting with re gard to Lord Sackrille s "unjurdon able conduct in his interference with tbe suffrage of American citizens and his subsequent public declara tions impugning the Executive aud Senate of the Lnited States in con nection with important questions now pending in controversy between the two governments. , A revision of the naturalization and passport laws so as to give more perfect protection to citizens abroad, while preventing abuse of the privi leges of citizenship, and "such a re organization uf the consular fee ser vice as will abolish perquisites," are additional suggestions not upeeifi calif included in departmental re ports already published. Tbe People' Hat lie. from the President's message: There should be no cessation of the struggle ontila plan is perfected, fair conservative towards existing industries, but which will reduce the cost to consumers of the necessarie of life, while it provide for our manufacturer the advantageof freer raw materials and permit no injury to the interests of American labor. The cause for which the battle is waged is compried within lines clearly and dist'netly defined. It should never be compromised. It is the people's cause. Tbe Art Amateur For December is tbe finest number ever published of this excellent ma gazine. Twocharming colored plates are given woodland winter land scape with man and dog trudging homeward just as the sun has set, and "Hearts are Trumps," a dainty young woman in an evening dress of blue tulle, playing cards.

It elevates the tastes of the people who practice it. W e see that it is proposed to organ ize a musical association in unar- utte. We are glad to hear this. Chailotte has some exceptionally fine talent and in a well directed or ganization would reflect great credit upon her citizens. Durham long ago took a step in this direction. The St. Cecilia So ciety, of this place, is a musical or ganization of which not only Dur- hamites but the people of fte whole State should feel a just pride in. The School of Music here is just as efficient as any in the State. The Recordeb would rejoice to see a musical organization in every town, and also a State organization. What say the lovers of music in North Carolina? We would like to hear from them and the State Press on this proposition, speak out, brethren. 1 et'a hare it! 1 . oraer providing lor sucn prisoners reasonable comfort and well being.
