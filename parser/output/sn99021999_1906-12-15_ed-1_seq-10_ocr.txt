Only eight days more for Christmas shopping. There seems tb be many a slip twlxt the applicant and the postmHs tershlp. If the president's choice for post muster at South Omaha had only been a rough rider, no further explanation would have been needed. Now approaches the day when the cotton-clad Santa Claus enters the lists against the otter, .reckless Individual who "didn't know It was loaded. Three powers have united for tho preservation of the atatus quo in Abys sinia, showing that King Menellk has wisely taken pointers from the sultan of Turkey. It Mayor "Jim" Is not careful some ono may lodge a complaint in the po lice court against him tor discharging firearms within the city limits in vio lation of tho ordinances. The confession of a member of the Texas Hallway commission that that body has failed In Ita object should be of advantage to Nebraska when draft 'ng a rate regulation law. Aggressive Utah gentiles may be latlsfled if they can show the connec tion between the head of the Mormon church and coal land frauds, but so far the "Z. C. M. I." has not been tested. The statement that Zulu converts of American missionaries join in re bellion against Great Britain in South Africa must mean that the preachers have spread the spirit of '76, as well as that of the Nazarene. Congressional modesty waa never better shown than when a bill to In crease the salaries et the vice presi dent, speaker and cabinet officers was pained before the bill to raise the wages of congressmen. Andrew Carnegie's desire for aa In herttance tax rather than for an in come tax would Indicate either that he has changed his opinion as to the dls grace of ditng rich, or that be knows a way to fool the tax collector. A report trora Berlin says that Emperor William would like to show (he clerical party that it is not essential to his power In the empire. This may be the royal way of answering the French premier's friendly advances. The Missouri lawyer who Insist that railroad auditors explain why statements made ln court are not com patible with statements made to stock holders la worthy of emulation in other stasia when assessments for taxation ace being considered. The official declaration that the guns of the Iowa and Brooklyn are anti quated calls attention to the fact that the art of war has advanced since the vessels did efficient service at Santiago; but tho new guns of today may also be worthless before they are used in battle. The attention of the honorable mayor and council Is directed to the resolution offered by one of Lincoln's counrllmen, that Omaha's streets are badly marred by sidewalk signs. In most cases theae signs are but a small refinement upon the odious b'llboard, both of which need moie stringent reg-ulatlou. 

WESTERN BA1LR0AD PREPARATION. The action of the board of directors of the Northern pacific, authorising a large stock issue, following so quickly the authorization of $60,000,000 ad ditional stock by the Great Northern, foreshadows extensive railroad con struction and betterments In the west ern field. All the great transconti nental interests bare indeed been placing themselves in position for such operations covering a series of years. The Union Pacific, as is well known, has enormous resources, both In the way of stock authorization and a cash fund, the proceeds of sale of Its hold ings in the now dissolved Northern Securities trust! Likewise the Mil waukee system, supposed to be In har mony with the Harrlman group, has within a few weeks arranged for a stock increase of $100,000,000, which would be available for ita extension to the coast, in large part paralleling the Hill lines at close range. These vast preparations do not necessarily Imply railroad war in the common acceptation of the phrase, al though there are numerous evidences of far-reaching hostility. The tre mendous development of the plain, mountain and coast regions would alone require and explain all the rail road extension in sight, or for which any sort of preparation Is being made. But whatever the motive behind these operations may be, it is apparent that the next two or three years will see completed an unprecedented amount of new railroad mileage and better ment in the west. FEDERATION RESPONSE TO ROOSEVELT It is significant that In the discus sions of the National Civic Federation the question of national taxation of Incomes and inheritances should, so distinctly take the foremost place. That this distinguished body of thoughtful men, drawn from all sec tions of the country and representing every variety of political, industrial, financial and social interest, should be absorbed In these problems, when so many other topics are pressing, indi cates that President Roosevelt in his message recommendations and the pre liminary suggestions has struck a re sponsive chord. It is obvious that he could not have expected substantial action on the two propositions at the present session of congress, but his challenge has elicited attention every where. It may well be that a leirlBlatlve re suit may come sooner than superficial observers now imagine. For, a the proceedings of the federation show, the question of revision of the tariff will raise the whole question of na tional revenue and open the oppor tunity, If the public mind be ready for It, to consider In its length and breadtn thd ,88U(J of ,ncome and ln. vn.n tnr.ti 

WALL STREETS PREDICAMENT. Wall street criticism of Secretary Shaw, taking it aa representative of the concentrated speculative Interest, la Identical In spirit with that which has been directed against a long line of his predecessors in office. It is intensl fled now only by his policy of dlstrlbu ting treasury surplus funds for deposit with the banks in all sections of the country instead of massing them In the eastern and, principally, the New York banks, and by the materially changed relations between the west and the eastern financial centers. In final analysis, the real grievance of these critics la against a situation for which neither Secretary Shaw nor any of his near predecessors is respon sible, namely, the subtreasury system. which has been the fixed policy of the country since 1846. Their proper course, if they wish a different treas ury policy, is to raise the issue can didly and squarely on the subtreasury system before the people. But the na tional Judgment and traditions are acknowledged to be so conclusively set against all proposals of that sort. notably the recent suggestion of a great central semi-official bank, that no one will come Into the open to press them, but. on the contrary, resort is had to evasions and schemes to ma nipulate the treasury funds. What enhances the exigency of the centralized speculative Interests is the rapid accumulation of loanable surplus throughout the interior of the country, which through the spring and summer months is mussed on deposit ln the eastern centers, drawn thither ln part by demand for mercantile and indus trial nses, but becoming also a stimu lant for the gambling flames always burning. It Is up to the financial In stitutions there to adjust themselves to the known fact that these balances from the interior will surely be drawn down during the autumn and winter months for crop movement and not to permit them to be tied up ln specula tive commitments. If Secretary Shaw had last summer deposited in the east ern centers the surplus revenue as it accumulated ln the subtreasury, as he is now blamed by the Wall street critics for not doing, such deposits would simply have been capitalized in speculation, at once increasing the money famine in the crisis and depriv ing himself of alleviating Its worst ef fects upon legitimate business. In short, the annual stringency In Wall street and all affiliated quarters Is bound to become more severe pre cisely as western financial potency irows, and as the treasury, handling directly its cash Income, disposes of the surplus more with a view to the broad business interest of the country. That policy wlH not be reversed, what ever Improvements may ba made In currency and banking methods Th.-s-wtner Wall street marlpiilatlre Inter ests appreciate thU fact and u -.v dlnate their doings to it the better it will be for the country, but more espe cially for Wall street Itself. THE SOVTH OMAHA roSTOFFlCE. Under the constitution the president has the sole and exclusive power, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, to fill all appointive offices not otherwise provided for by law. Strictly speaking, it is the president's right and privilege to name as postmaster at South Omaha anyone whom he may see fit to choose and to ask the senate to confirm the appointment. A long established custom, however. has secured the force of unwritten law by which representatives in congress, if of the same political faith with the party in power, are accorded the right to recommend candidates for postoffice vacancies in their respective districts, and to have such recommendations ac cepted In the absence of objections go ing to fitness or integrity. It is only pursuant to this unwritten law that the postmaster general notifies the con gressman when such a vacancy occurs and asks for his recommendation. In the matter of the South Omaha postofflce everything seems to have gone along according to rule until the recommendation made by Congressman Kennedy reached the president, where a different name, urged from other and outside sources, was substituted, evi dently as a personal favor to a former cabinet member who never lived ln this district. Even under these circum stances it seems to us that the presi dent might with propriety have sent for Congressman Kennedy and told him that he wished to make a personal appointment at South Omaha, or at least to have notified him that his rec ommendation made at the solicitation. of the Postofflce department would not be entertained. The South Omaha postofflce is not such an important position that its pos session will determine the fate of na tions,, but it undoubtedly has a large bearing locally upon the strength or weakness of the party organization. So long as the post mastership is a po litical prize, it ought to be awarded in recognition of political service with a view to the future welfare of the party, especially since the republican party In Nebraska has already too many heavy loads of this kind to carry. P. S. The withdrawal of the nom ination and the substitution of the name of the candluate endorsed by Congressman Kennedy in no way invali dates what The Bee has here said, although It may be taken as evidence that the president did not intentionally disregard Mr. Kennedy's endorsements. Irrespective of the merits of the differ ent candidates for appointment to the position, all of whom are doubtless competent to perform the duties, it will surely be far better for the party to have It known that the source of favor for local patronage is somewhere near at home, rather than ln the hands of far-distant strangers. THE 

JAIL FEEDIXQ CONTRACT. The presentation to the county board at last of a Dill rendered by the sheriff for feeding county Jail prboners at rates considerably in excess of those fjxed by resolution of tho board last year calls attention again to the ne cessity of legislation that will put an end to this contehtlon. The jail feeding contract has been a stench In the nostrils of the taxpay ers altogether too long. ' There is no good reaaon why it should cost sub stantially mora to feed prisoners In the county Jail than it does to feed those in the city Jail, yet the sheriff is trying to collect more than twice as much. If tho feeding of prisoners ln the county Jail were let by contract the same as is the feeding of prisoners In the city Jail and bids received upon carefully drawn specifications satisfac tory service could be secured at a great saving ot outlay. Whatever may be the conditions ln other counties no reason exists why ln populous counties like ours in which the average number of prisoners does not vary greatly throughout the year, the Jail feeding contract should be a perquisite of the sheriff's office. The sheriff has plenty to do to attend to the legitimate duties devolving upon him for which he is amply paid. An absolute divorce between the sheriff's office and the jail feeding business would be a salutary reform. It la all right for the state associa tion of county commissioners and su pervisors to create a legislative com mittee to present desired measures to the legislature and appear before the committees to explain their bills and the arguments for their enactment, but there is no call for planting a perma nent lobby at Lincoln to belabor the law-makers and to imitate tne meth ods of the professional lobbyists. The first thing the legislature should do should be to put a damper on the in terference of paid lobbyists andyt will be difficult to discriminate between those hired by corporate masters and those professing to represent organiza tions of public or semt-publlc bodies. Had Omaha voted to put in a mu nicipal lighting plant when the propo sition was submitted the chances would be ttood that no more than one generating plant would suffer and break down at the same time. Since we are entirely dependent on the exist ing company it is to be hoped the ma chinery will be gotten into working order at once and full provUlon made against future mishaps by the installa tion of dupllae engines and dynamos.

TUB NEW UOOK ESTIMATES. Some Flgrwrea oa the Coat of Runul the Government. ' Chicago Tribune. Few of the millions of United States citizens have any notion of what it coats to run the government. If the secretary ot the treasury submits bia budget calling fur upwards of IGM),000,W0 for the year between July 1, 19u7, and June 30, 1, the general Impression Is gained that the amount is quite large, but the average cltl ten lets It go at that If, however, curiosity lead to more de tailed examination It la discovered that the country s budget is contained ln a large volume of mure than 0 pages, ln which, with minute exactness, the esti mutes for each branch of the government are Indicated, tl.c lu-n.s being plainly given for the benefit of the congressman whoae appropriation hills are based upon this book of estimates.

The Ituatlon thua rreclpltated Is deplorable from every point of view. The Inane 1 not wparation of church and atate. for eP- aratlon U a fact accomplished. It Involves the destruction of the autonomy of all churchea and the division of ownership and control of church property among lnymen organized l:i associations subject to alate license and atate regulation. Tho church authorities knew from experience the world over the insecurity of lay control and evidently elected to face the crlla at once rather than a prolonged agony under the onerous provisions of the separation law. Cdnflscatlon of church property seema In evitable. In n contest between church men passive and opponents of religion entrenched In power and challenged to dr their worst, reprisal l likely to go to the limit. Unless the unexpected happens. churche and religious Institutions, fam ous In the history of the nation and hallowed by associations running back over centurlea, will be ahorn of their charac ter and bocome loot for avaricious com munities. The present situation extends back to the French revolution. In that blondv up heaval the expensive property of the church was seized by measures of nm. flacation. Eventually the claims of the churrh were commuted by nn agreement cmDoalPa ln lne concordat signed In mi. Hy thle the church abandoned Its claims to the property of which It had been dis possessed and accepted annual grants from the state for the support of Its organ ization. In repealing the concordat and terminating the annual grants, the govern ment takes the position that at the same time the church loses all legal rights to the church property It has occupied and used for public worship, except by the trace of the state, which can be obtained only In the way prescribed by law. In default of this the government claims the right to eject all congregations and priests from their houses of worship and all bishops and other church officials from the buildings occupied by them. The law applies even to some Soon churches built by private subscription or bequest. Including some built by American sub scription. The thoory of the law Is that the church property has been acquired on tho basis of revenues derived from the state and la In the nature of a usufruct belonging to the state and available by the church only on such terms as the state sees fit to accord. The latest phase of the Americanization of Germany la the substitution of messen ger boys for the "Dienstmannnr." In Munich one still sees many of these por- tera, with red caps, standing at street cor ners, ready for any Job, from helping ono to find lodgings to carrying a bundle or a message or taking a trunk to a station. In Berlin only a, few of them are left, mostly at the railway station. The others have been put out of business by the now general mercantile custom of delivering packages at the homes of purchasers, and by the additional facllltlea offered by tho telephone and the "Rohrpost," or pneu matic mail tubes. Nevertheless, It has been found that there are occasions when all these means of communication fall, and an "Eilboten-Insltut" has been establlohed In Frankfort and in Berlin for supplying mes senger boys. M The Italian government came to the con clusion some time ago that too many offi cial free telegrams were forwarded within the kingdom. The number of these mes sages was In one year 2.4.T7.419, against 10,4,)0 that were paid for, whereas Ger many had only 1, 200,000 free telegrams to 33.000,000 that were paid for, while the pro portion in Kngland was still lower 44,0OO to S8,000,000. Notwithstanding the edict, a Sicilian prefect sent out the other day 300 telegrams stating that a certain person had lost a cow and requesting that she be returned to the owner. This dispatch was sent not only to Sicilian stations, but all over southern Italy. A socialist journal got wlud of the remarkable proceeding and ma.la ao much ado over It that the gov ernment ordered an Investigation. The prefect explained that he had Intended the dispatch for Sicily only, and never thought It would be forwarded across the water, which the cow wag certainly not likely to swim; but It waa deemed advisable to make an example and he was fined 607 lire. M In the upper house, of the Hungarian Parliament various religions of the country are represented by prominent church digni taries. There are about 9(0.000 Jews In Hungary, but the religion not having been officially recognized until IRC It haa never had a representative ln the House of Irds. The municipality of Tulua has called this fact to the attention of the government and has asked that steps be taken toward Jewish representation. It is believed that In consequence of this petition a rabbi will soon be named fur a place among the peers. It will be difficult, however, to find a man who will be acceptable alike to the Orthodox and the Reformed Jews, and aa both wings are officially recognized, two rabbla, one Orthodox and one Reformed, may be named.

Governor Hoch of Kansas miya that alnce ills re-election he has undertaken a new contract. It Is, In tho governor's terse vo cabulary, "To drive boozo out of business." Lewis Emery, late fusion candidate for governor of Pennsylvania, has retracted campaign charges niado against a state senator and thereby escaped the expense of a libel pult. Mr. Hearst's statement of his campaign expenses, which footed up I2o5.000, appears to have been merely a sample nugget. The totnl output of the lode will have to be left to the lmuglaatlon. Senator Tillmnn declined to omit dash words from a lecture for the benefit of an Ohio church and his engagement waa can celled. The senate has no means of en forcing the Ohio system. The Britishers rail and turn their eyes out and up when discussing the vast expen ditures for American political campaigns. Yet an official statement of the expenses for the 870 members of Parliament recently elected puts the total at 16,834,30, or an average of 93 cents a vote. The expendi tures of presidential campaigns in tho United States did not exceod $5,000,000 until ISM. 1!KjO ai d 1904, when they were saJd to run between $7,000,000 and JIO.000,000. .
