GREAT QUESTIONS. Whether the free, independent and unlimited coinage of silver, 16 to 1, is a dead issue or nor, there is one thing sure, and that is, bimetallism as a live question will soon be coiferonting the people. The Republican party not only stands for the largest possible use of sil ver, as it has always stood, but it is pledged to use its coming power to se cure international bimetallism. The Republican party has never been inim ical to silver. It has only held, strenu ously, for a parity of the two metals, silver and gold. Whether a majority of the people at heart are for free silver or not, unquestionalry a large majority are for bimetallism, and for the consump tion or use of the entire silver product of the world as money. While 16 to 1 was settled by the last election by near ly a million majority of the American people, the currency queston of the country was not settled. It is the ques tion of all others right at this present moment As it is a feature of Cleve land's message of yesterday, so will it be of 3IcKInley's on the 4th day of next March. The future basis of the currency for tills country is as pressing now as a question as that of national revenues. In short, the satisfactory settlement of the one would logically take care of the other. Prosperity insures an abundant revenue, "but before prosperity must come the confidence which a satisfac tory currency can alone insure. There can, in other words, be no return of permanent prosperity until all doubts of the soundness and elasticity of our cur rency is assured. So only a few days subsequent to the election we find a monetary conference being held at In dianapolis. This conference did not con sist of silverites or goldbugs, per se, but of representative business men. There must not only be soundness, as we havo now, but of elasticity which we have not The greenback, with its gold basis, and the certificate, with its silver re demption, do not work satisfactorily, either as to the revenues of the govern ment or the business interests of the country. This, among other things, the Indianapolis conference held to, and this will be that which will confront the new congress the first thing. These qticstions will be taken up by another and a much larger convention at Indi anapolis, called to meet January 5th, 1S97, the results and conclusions of which conference will be laid before the next session of congress, if not before the present one. 

CLEVELAND ON CUBA. The words of President Cleveland's message, touching the Cuban question, will Ie found to be no less radical and assuring than were desired by the Aiuer ican people; but they disclose the fact that the present administration has, in being very conservative, not been wholly remiss or unmindful of the cause of the Cuban patriots. However, Cuba does not wish home rule, but independ ence, and independence only will satisfy either Cuba or her great neighbor. In an interview recently printed in the Paris Jonrnal, Senor Canovas, prime minister of Spain, among other state ments of great interest declared that while he believed the Spanish people were ready to sacrifice their blood and to give their money to whatever extent might be necessary to retain Cuba, "the nation 4s free to change its opinion; and if the day should come when it tired of continuing the struggle, and should de sire to abdicate its dignity, I would not strive to prevent it I would retire." The significance of these remarks lice in the fact that the possibility of such a change in Spanish opinion should have been admitted by the prime minister of Spain. The senor, perhaps, foresees that notwithstanding the magnificent re sponse of the people to the appeal of the government for popular subscription to its SuO.000,000 loan, they may not be proof against a reaction of feeling un less some decisive victory shall soon crown the Spanish arms in Cuba. 

ENGLAND IN EGYPT Great Britain is in trouble over her Nile expedition and its farther advance into the interior may not be a possibil ity, as has been contemplated. It will be remembered that Egypt, at the solic itation or instigation of England, fur nished the money from Its treasury to pay the expenses of the great march which was named for Dongola, but which was intended to reach Khartoum, if not entirely across the continent. However, other European powers were and are interested in the Egyptian treasury. These filed a protest'against any such use of the Egyptan revenues by England. The protest was unheed ed. But now an international or mixed tribunal of the powers interested has or dered Johnny Bull to pay back ?2o.000, 000 into the Egyptian treasury. What England will do is not known to the world at large. The mouey has been spent and the Soudan remains undisci plined. Under the finding England can get no more Egyptian money. Eng land claims that the expedition so far has resulted in opening up to cultivation under, possible irrigation, 1,000.000 acres countryof laud, and from which the prosperity of that country is to be en hanced to an incalculable degree. But the French, more especially, protest that they do not want the Upper Nile utilized at their expense, and France has a large interest in Egypt's finances. It looks now as if England will either be compelled to abandon her filibuster ing expediton, made ostensibly in the interest of civilization, or otherwise to foot her own bills. THE RIVER RACKENSACK. On the liith of the present month, as hcrtofore noticed in the Eagle, there will convene at Fort Smith, under the auspices of the Commercial League of that city, a convention of delegates from Arkansas. Oklahoma, the Indian Territory and South Kansas. The pur pose of the convention primarily I to memorialize congress to take care of the waters of the Arkansas r:vert with a view o its immediate improvement for 'the purposes of navigation. From ad vices received by the Commercial League the convention will be numer ously attended and by delegates even as far: west as Colorado. By or through the improvement of the Arkansas, traf fic relief is expected to the entire Arkan sas valley. The Arkansas river is among the longest streams hi the world. Its valley is a thousand miles in length, as the crow flies. The river flows through three states and two territories. It is I. the Nile of America in the character of its flow and its soiL Years ago the Eagle believing that the river's naviga tion being an impossibility, with no probability of a railway being construct ed along its valley from mouth to source suggested a canal for its entire length. For a canal the river would furnish an abundance of water. At least from central Kansas to-tide water on the Mssissippi there would be few locks comparatively necessary. Such a' water would forever settle the transportation question for the states and territories which the river traverses. However, we will watch the proceed ings and results of the contemplated convention with no small degree of in terest China could hardly become in this cen tury a constitutional government A people who did not even know they were having a war with Japan could never awake enough interest to strike the Mow to make them free.

Daniels in forms us that on Saturday night a week ago a serenading party composed of the Haw ley Steel band, "Doc" as the leader, sot out to charivari J J. Hopper, the report having gone out that that gentleman had taken unto himself a wife. Accordingly sixteen of the boys wended their way towards Haw ley and at the appointed hour rounded up near the kitchen in the rear of the main building where J. J. has long been accus tomed to making a square meal on sour dough biscuits and bosom of the pig, all his own cooking. The boys were armed with guns, tin pans, steel cutters, etc., and v hen they tore loose they imagined it would cot be but a few moments until the roof of the house would be slowly soaring away in the air. They hammered, and beat, and rounded, and yelled, but to no avail, for the door remained closed and the curtains closely drawn. A gentle smoke poured forth from the stove-pipe, and one fellow conceived the idea and with board in hand scaled the roof and placed it over the pipe with the remark: "Boys, we'll smoke 'em out." It was not long untii the door flew open, and the crowd, eager to see the new bride, filed into the room. J. J. sat smoking Us old cob pipe, and when "Doc" told him what they were there for he heaved a heavy sigh. and said: "Boys, you have been misinformed: there is no lady about the house, and the report that I have juse been married is false." This was a corker to th crowd, and squarely reversed their fondest hopes ard expectations. Instead of being permitted to view a blvshing bride, and to smoke with a bridegroom, all they could do was to saze upon each other In utter dis gust and wish for a hole into which they might crawl out of sight. It coat them 10 cents around, and some were eager to chip In a quarter more with the understanding that they should never be given away. For once there v.ere more suciors than fish. ALONG THE KANSAS NILE- Nc-t a bill that Peffer ever introduced or even talked on ever became a law. A great Kansas man once said that our debts -acre evidences of our prosperity. The report that Justice Allen had sold out to the eastern corporations originated with a Populist CaUin Hood of Emporia held one J10.0CO block of stock in the Kansas City bank which failed last week. The "El Dorado Republican says those short-tall undershirts now in style are m.' sign of a moderate winter. The well-to-do class In Kansas today are the fanners. The old-fashioned Populists are exclusively town people. It is said that John Breidenthal and Peffer will both use their influence to have the TopeLa Mail kept the official paper. W P. Tomlinson of Topeka will probably rustle around and get the Topeka Demo crat made the official paper. If he can. A good many fellows let out a sigh of re lief like the nxir of a cyclone when they found that. Baker and Cy. Lelaad were still friendly. The fellows who do not think that Judge ei ulson is running do not know the man. He has never yet entered a race just fc-r the excitement. While it is said that the wheat crop of Wichita county was this year a failure. ono hundred cars of it have been snipped already from Leoti, the county seat. Kurtz of :he Augusta Press !oesjvt like "Will "Whiter "Wm Whits is BHtler county property, and Kurtz should learn to like him if he expects to remain in the county. In western TTanaa one train stops daily and picks up twenty-five or thirty cars of white corn. This corn is shipped to Mexico and the fanners get one dollar a "bushel for it P. P .Elder was down In Topeka the other day. He hasn't been there much since the time they beat him for the United States senate and sent Peffer. The night Elder was beaten he displayed more color in his words than any artist's palette ever knew New York Evening Post: Senator Peffer is naturally both puzzled and pained at the efforts to defeat his re-election by the Pop ulist legislature of Kansas. He has sent out a circular letter to all the members whom he regards as his "logical support ers," in which he sets forth the arguments for his re-election with a lucidity and force which we do not see how any supporter with a grain of logic in him can withstand. He has taken his stand, to begin with, on the impregnable position that "a senator, just like a man in any other calling, mubt learn his business, and that takes time." Peffer has been "studious and diligent," and has learned the business. Why turn him off just as he :s ready to attain "the high est standard of usefulness?" Nor will his modesty prevent him from pointing- out his solid achievements wnlle learning the busi ness. Just look at this condensed but elo quent account -of his efforts, as compiled from the Congressional Record: Whole number petitions presented 300 JBllls and joint resolutions introduced. ...202 Reports submitted S7 Senate and concurrent motions and reso lutions 62 Amendments proposed Speeches, long and short 437 It is truly a record from which no one need run away except from the speeches. That item, we think, might have been made more convincing- for logical supporters if more carefully analyzed. Just how many of the speeches were long? How many hours would they have consumed if deliv ered consecutively? How many times around the globe would they have reached if strung on end? "That is the way to make statistics, if not speeches. Interesting. And, after all. there is, from the Kansas point of view, a certain logical weakness in Senator Ferrer's position. He has not lived up to the prophecies made about him six years ago. Then there was no talk about him requiring time to learn the senatorial business. He was prepared to z once make the money power quake. Laws to enable every borrower in Kansas to get money out of the sub-treasury at 2 per cent, and no questions asked about the security, were to be written by him in the books without de lay. Thus he is in the unlucky position of having- deferred a promised millennium. I it bad to go six years over-due, who knows but it may still be delayed another of Pef fer's terms? On the other hand, any one of his rivals before the legislature would, wc have no manner of doubt, engage to begin the chaining of the devil the very day after taking his seat. If Peffer is beaten, it will be due to the overpowering desire of Kan sas to get her millennium hot and hot VON TAUSCH AND VON KOTZE Indication That the Latter Troubles Are Dua to the former. Berlin, Dec. 7. Strong circumstantial and direct evidence has been placed in th hands of the court indicating that Major von Tausch, the commissioner of detective police; Baron von Luetzow and others engineered the whole von Kotze scandal. Count von. Kotze was the royal court chamberlain. He waa arrested in June, lfl4, charged with having been the agent who had been disseminating anonymous letters and postal cards making the most indecent personal accusations against members of the highest German aristoc racy. The police investigations had been going on for four years before von Kotze was arrested. His arrest did not put a stop to the receipt of the offending let ters, and, von Kotze's Innocence being legally established, he was freed and re stored to his position at court In ac cordance with his demand, he was tried by a military tribunal, which acquitted him. Upon his acquittal Count von Ko tze had on his hands a large number of affairs of honor with men who were im plicated in the charges against him. He has fought three duels, the last of which with Baron von Schraeder, master of cermonies of the Prussian court, resulted in the latter's -death and von Kotze's con finement in a fortress as a punishment CONVICTED OF LIBEL Count Ealeaberg Arrives From Vienna and Gives Testimony. Berlin, Dec. 7. Count Philip Zu Eul enberg, German ambassador to Austria, arrived here today from Vienna to testi fy at the trial of Herr Leckert, Baron von Luetzow, Herr Ploetz, Herr Berger and Herr Foellmer, newspaper men charged with libeling Count August zu Eulenberg, court chamberlain, Baron Marschall von Bieberstein and Prince Alexander von Hohenlohe. when the trial was resumed Baron von Tausch, commissioner of detectives, was arrest ed on the charge of perjury. Count Philip was the first witness call ed. He testified that he had but a slight acquaintance with von Tausch, adding: "It is a calumny and a malicious in vention to say I have had relations with von Tausch, "and especially in connec tion with the article referred to. I have nothing whatever to do with such Intri gues. I spoke confidentially with Baron Marschall on matters connected with this trial. Apart from this I knew noth ing which could be put in evidence." At the conclusion of a long speech the public prosecutor demanded that Herr Leckert and Baron von Luetzow be sen tenced to one month's imprisonment and that the other defendants be sentenced to short terms of imprisonment Berlin, Dec. 7. Herr Leckert has been sentenced to eighteen months imprison ment for libelous slander. Herr von Luetzow was sentenced for the same period for simple slander. Herr Ploetz was fined 500 marks and Herr Ber ger was sentenced to a mqnth's imprison ment for insulting the foreign minister. Her Foellmer was fined 100 marks for insulting Baron Marschall von Bieber stin, minister of foreign affairs. Herr Leckert, Sr., was acquitted.

Guthrie, O. T., Dec. 7. Alfred Son has been convicted of murder at El Reno. The Son case comes from D county and is one of the most famous in the west. D county is a western Oklahoma coun tv of wnich the small town of Taloga is the county seat Nearly two years ago its treasurer, Hoffman, was killed. In the little county building his office may still be seen. In it is a great iron safe The combination has been knocked off and the county's funds are now secured by a big chain which Is wrapped around the knobs of the safe and locked with a padlock. "Vhen Hoffman was found murdered the county commissioners decided that it would cost more to get an expert to come out and open the safe in a regular way than the county could possibly scrape up after the fund3 were secured from the safe. So an ax and a cold chisel did the work. Alfred Son had a trial at El Reno about a year ago but the jury disagreed. The present jury remained out forty eight hours, Mr. Robinson, one of the jurors, holding out for Son. Judge Tars ney issued further instructions and a ver diet of guilty was brought in. Alfred Son, who is a boy about 21 years old, did not show by any sign or expres sion of the face, when he heard the ver dict, that it ruffled or In any way dis pleased him. On the contrary, while he listened to the verdict while being con ducted to the jail, and after the door closed behind him, he still maintained the same confident smile that has been with him ever since the trial began. He knows his friends are working with might and main for his liberty, and they will get it for him if possmie. The trial of one of the Pettijohns wlh probahly come up at this term. Pettl john is under indictment on the same charge with Son. On Jan. 22, 1895, Fred Hoffman, at that time county treasurer of D county and also United States commissioner, was found dead on the north bank of the South Canadian river about five mlle3 southwest of the town of Taloga. There was a bullet hole through his head which was unmistakable evidence that he had been murdered. There seemed to be but a small clue to the perpetrators of the deed, yet Hoffman had a number of enemies and the suspicion was directed toward some of them. Shortly after the murder Deputy Chris. Madsen and posse arrested Grant Pettijohn and Alfred and JJaley Son. Grant Pettijohn was at that time editor of the Taloga Tomahawk, and a young gentleman who stood well in the estimation of the people. The Son boys were prominent young stock men of the county wholiad never before been suspester -of crime. No particular mo tive could be shown why these men should have killed Hoffman, only that they were on opposite sides oiwthe herd law questions arising out of the disor ganized condition of affairs existing in fhrn- vmnrv at the time. The defendants were first brought before United States Commissioner "Wass, who decided that the Un'ted States courts had no jurisdic tion in the matter, but the defendants were held to await the action of the grand jury of D county. A true bill was returned against all three of the defendants and they were arraigned - in court; upon motion a change of venue was given the defend-, ants to Canadian; county. l When the day of trial came' the?, cases were sepa rated and only Afred Son was placed on trial. The case lasted nearjy a week but the jury failed to agree upon a verdict and the case was again set for trial at this term of court When the case was called last Monday Attorneys Springston and Black of Ta loga and McKnight of Arapahoe appear ed in behalf of the Territory while Sena tor Temple Houston, and R. J. Ray of Woodward and Judges Griggsby and Titzer of El Reno represented the de fendants. All parties answered ready for trial. It took the greater part of Monday to select the jury. Tuesday morning the attorneys for the territory stated their case and proceeded to examine their wit nesses. The first fact established was that Fred Hoffman was killed at the time and place stated above. They then put! witnesses on the stand who testified that Alfred Son and several others werv in a saloon at Taloga the morning of the murder, also that Alfred Son had hired a buggy and team of a liveryman that morning and he in company with some unknown man whom the prosecution tried to prove was Zip Wyatt, Red Buck, or some other outlaw, had driven away in a southwesterly direction from the town The unknown mysterious Individual, whoever he was, had a gray horse bridl ed and saddled, which he led behind the buggy. The evidence located the defend ant In perhaps a mile or two cf the place and within an hour of the time when Hoffman was supposed to have been mur dered. The prosecution placed Mrs. F. Godwin, nee Mi" Shanholzer, on the stand. She testified that the day the murder was committed, she was visit ing friends out on the J. V. Flats south west of Taloga and that Alfred Son, the defendant came after her in a buggy and brought her home to Taloga. Os cross examination she stated that she had gone out there the Saturday before and as she did not want to stay a wee, she left a note with her brother to give to Alfred Son. when he came to town, telling Son that she wanted him to call for her Tuesdaj. and that he would find her at the schoolhouse. The place whre the young lady was stopping and wht?rtj Son found her that day was In the eame direction that he and the stranger was J seen to drive away from town on the morning of the murder of Hoffman. The territory rested their case at A o'clock p. m.. Wednesday, but the attorneys claimed that they had two othr wit nesses whose testimony would be materi al, but could not get them at this time. An attachment bad been issued but the witnesses had not arrived. At this everybody was surprised when Temple Houston In behalf of the defense aroe and announced to tha court that the de fendant would put no witnesses on the stand and that they were now redy to rwt thMr .ar The defendants attor neys had evidently concluded ihat the territory naa laiiea to max? a. caw. j.ns spectator were fomewhat disappointed for i: was understood that the defense would put witnesses on the stand that would certainly throw some light oa the mysterious caus or uo.unan. The court took a recess until 1HA p. rn. Upon the reconvening of the court Jude Tar?ney read an -elaborate and carefulJy prepared charge to the jury. The judge limited the argument to two speeches oa a side. A Urge crowd had gathered to hear the sp-echea of the distinguished councit The argument w opened by Attorney Black of Tatea fa behalf of the teritorr.
