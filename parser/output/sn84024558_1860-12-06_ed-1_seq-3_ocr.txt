TARIFF. It is quite evident ibul the financial tiecesi ot-s ot ttie GoVt riuiietit v\ i!'f rcfJirh a aiodifi catioii ut' lite tariff duricg lite present session, for the pttrpose ot iticreasitig the revenue. In tt lis aspect k desire to reiterate the recommen dation contained in my last two annual messa ges, iu tavor of iniposfng specific instead Of advalor. ttt duties oil ail imported articles to which these can be properly specified. From long observation and experience, I am cotiviu Ct-d that specific duties are necessary, both to protect the revenue and secure lo otrr luarruftrc- interests that aiuonot of *Tifnleuta! en- Couiagetuetit which Unavoidably results from a revenue tariff'. As an abstiact proposition it may be admit ted that ad ralore/n Unties Would, in theory, be the most just and equal. Rut if the experi ence of this and of ad other commercial na tions lias demonstrated that suclt duties cau nut lie assessed and collected without great 'rands upon tiie revenue, then it is the pTrt ol , wisdom lo resort to specific duties. Indeed, Tarn the veiy nature of an ad valorem du'v, to must be the result. UndeT it the inevita •tr-'isequeuce is that loreigu goods will be --cd at less than their true value. The -toury will, therefore, lose the duly on the --Ttiice between their real and ficticious val- I ®t. and to this extent we are defrauded. Re temptations which ad valorem duties pre j ? fct to a dishonest importer are irresitable. — Uii object is to pass his goods through the fjatow-llouse at tiie very lowest valuation i"Wessaiey to save thetn from confiscation. Iu tins lie too often succeed*, in spile ot the vig ilimee ot the revenue officers. Hence the rc- Wt to talse mvuices.one trfr the puretiaser and •Wher lur the Cits tout House, aniJ to other expedients to defraud the Government. The loaesst importer produces his invoice to the col rector, stating the actual price ut which he purchased toe articles alnoad. Not so the bisliouest importer and the agent of the for l-o uiaiiuiacture. And here it may be ob ' lv td that a very large proportion of the toiiu;uctures imported Irom abroad are cou -5, 3 r| ietl lor sttle to commission merchants who *'f Uit -' rL ' agents employed by the munufuctur e " In such cases no actual sale has been Me to fix their value. The foreign mauo -7' !rer ,i' ' le he dishonest,prepares an invoice i " l,; l-'bods, not at their actual value, but ut vcry lowest rate necessary to escape de u'-" 1 - Li this manner the dishonest imjyort , ai ' ,J l ' ie loreign manufacturer enjoy a decid a< vantage over the hottest merchant. They enabled to undersell the fair trader, 1 i nve linn from the market. In fact the pwaiion of this system has already driven if ° I ,ursu ' lß °I honorable commerce many (.i 7 c ' a ' 8 °f regular and conscientious mer UN, whose charaeters.throughout the world, j y pride of our country. idP R*,. rtUltfl y ' or these evils is to be found in Ve U 'ri Uies ' so ar as , ' l ' s mu l l ' l)e practica- Cu: f . 7 d, T ,|ie Wll h any inquiry at the the arG .! '" to l ' ie ac ' tosl Df value of dutv .' ' ' P a^s tlie P rec 'Be amount of no 'tem7t' <^ y fiXt ' d bj bw The J Present foods in 10 the n PP raisers of foreign > 'lO receive but small salaries, and might, by uudervalution iu a few cases, render themselves independent. Besides, specific duties best conform to the requisition iu the constitution that "no prefer ence shall be given by any regulation of com merce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another." Under our ad valor em system such preferences are to some extent inevitable, and complaints have olten been made that the spirit of this provision has been violated by a lower appraisment of the same articles at one port than at another. An impression strangely enough prevails ro some extent that specific duties are necessarily protective duties. Nothing can be more fai iacious. Great Britain glories in free trade, and yet her whole revenue from imports is at the present moment collected under a system of specific duties. It is a striking fact in this connection that, in the commercial treaty ot the 23d of January, 1860, between France and England, one of the articles provides ad valorem duties which it imp ses shall be couvert j ed into specific duties within six months (rem its date, and tlleSe are to be ascertained by making an average of life prices for six months previous to that time. The reverse of the proposition would be nearer to the truth, be cause a much larger amount of revenue would be collected by merely converting the ad valorem duties of a tariff into equivalent specific duties. To this extent the revenue wodld be increased, and in the game prooora tion the specific duty might be diminished. Specific duties would secure to the Ameri can manufacturer the incidental protection to which he is fairly entitled under a revenue tar iff, and td this* surely no person would object. The framers of (lie existing tariff luite gone further, and in a liberal spirit have discrimi nated in favor of iarge and useful branches of our manufactures, not by rafting tlie rate of duty upon the importation of similar articles from abroad, but what is the same in effect, by admitting articles free of duty which cuter into the composition of their fabrics. Under the present system it has been often trulj - remarked that the incidental protection decreases when the manufacturer needs it most, and increases rlien he needs it least, und Coiistitdtes a sliding scale which always operates against him. The revenues of the country are subject to similar fluctuation. In stead of approaching a steady standard, as Wofll'l be the case under a system of specific duties, they sink and rise with the sinking and rising prices of articles iu foreign countries. It would not be difficult for Congress to arrange a system of specific duties which would afford additional stability both to our revenue and our manufactures, and without injury or injustice to any interest of the country. This aright be accomplished by ascertaining the average value of any given article for a series or years at the place of exportation, and by simply conve.ting the rate of ad valorem duty upon it which might be deemed necessary for rev enue purposes, into the form of a specific duty. Such an arrangement could not injure the con sumer. If he should pay a greater amount Of tint? one year, this would bo count" rbalaneed by a lesser amount the next, and in the end the aggregate would be the same. I desire to call your immediate attention to the present condition of the Treasury, so ably anil clearly presented by the Secretary in his report to Congress ; and to recommend i hut measures be promptly adopted to enable it to di charge its pressing obligations. The other recommendations of the report are weil worthy of your favorable consideration. I herewith transmit to Congress the reports of the Secretaries of War, of the Navy, of the Interior, and of the Pu-t Muster General. Therecomttcfida'tfons and suggestions which they contain are highly valuable, ami deserve your careful attention. The report of the Post-Master-Genera! de tails lhe circumstances under which Cornelius Yanderbilt, on my request, agreed, in the month of July lest, lo c..rr* the ocean mails between our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Had he not thus acted, this important intercom muuicatiori must have been suspended, at least for a season. The Postmaster General had no power to make him any other compensation, than tin* postages ott the mail matter which he might carry. It was known at the time that these postages would fall far short of an adequate con?p*nsJtion. as well as of the sum which the same service had previ ously cost the Government Mr. Vandcrbilt, in a commendable spirit, was willing to rely upon the justice of Congress to make np tlie deficiency i and I, therefore, recommend that an appropriation may be granted for this pur pose. • I should do great injustice to the Attorney- General tfere I t6 omit the mentib'u of his di tingnished services in the measures adopted and prosecuted by him for the defense of the Government against numerous and unfounded claims to iand in California, purporting to have been made by thh Mexican Government pre vious to the treaty of cession: The successful opposition to these claims has saved to the United States public property worth many millions Of dollars, and to individuals holding title under them to at least an equal amount. It has been represented to me, ffcnr sources which I deem reliable, that the inhabitants in several portions of Kansas have been reduced nearly to a state of starvation, on account of tiie almost total failure of their crops, while the harvests in every other portion of the country have been abundant. The prospect before them for the approaching Winter is well calculated to enlist the sympathies Of ev ery heart. The destitution appears to be so general that it cannot lie relieved by private contributions, and they are in such indigent cir cumstances as to be unable to purchase the necessaries of life for themselves. I refer the subject (o Congress. If any constitutional measure for their relief can be devised, I would recommend its adoption. I cordially commend to your favorable ri • gard the interests of the people of this Dis trict. Tficy are eminently entitled to your consider,itian, especially since unlike the Bta!G, they can appeal to no government except that of the Union.

TOWANDA: Thursday Morning, December 6, 1860. To the Patrons of the Reporter. Iu accordance with the notice which was given last week, the present number of the Reporter appears under the name of a new publisher. In undertaking the manage ment of a newspaper, it is usual to indulge in a " salutatory," in which is set forth the course the paper is intended to pursue, and the fea tures which are intended to (rcofflrhend it to the public.* 1 We hopd we may be exCnsed from doing either. The Reporter has so long been a pleasant visitor to the fireside, and has so long, by (he advocacy of those principles which have made the name of the country n " tower of strength," merited the confidence and respect of its patrons under its former publisher, that it would be presumptions in us to say any more than that it rill be our con stant effort to maintain for it that preeminence which it now possesses. How well we may be able to accomplish this, time alone will de termine ; but we hope that with the assistance we shall from time to time receive trom the pen of Mr. Gooritfcrt, that the change will be less a change than may have been anticipa ted. We are of those who believe that the value of a newspaper is not measured by the length of its articles, nor bjr the number of lines that may be written upon subjects which may be its editors particular hobby ; but rather from its judicious seiections, its collation of news, and brief and concise articles upon what may be the exciting topics of the day ; and we shall endeavor to shape our course accord ingly. We shall endeavor to procure ns far as pos sible, all the local news of interest, and to this end we hope to receive aid from friends in town and county who will interest themselves in the matter. A good array of local trans actions speaks well of the activity of a town, and we hope as we become better acquainted with the people to be able tcmake this feature interesting. The ready pay system which has been the rule of the paper heretofore, but Which lias not been rigidly adhered te'o, will hereafter be striekiy enforced. YTe believe it to'be for the best interest of both parties, and we hope our friends will view it accordingly. We shall endeavor to make the paper an equivalent for t.i'e dollar, and this can oniy be done as we have the means to do it. That our intercourse may be pleasant and profitable, ir.'j that tlie paper may command that generous support which we shall labor to insure for it, is the earnest wish of THE PrßLisnEß. At a rf'g'ilar meeting of Franklin Fire Co., No. 1, *iMd at the Engine House on Saturday evening, December Ist, ftCO, the following officers were elected for the ensuing year • Foreman. —J. V.
