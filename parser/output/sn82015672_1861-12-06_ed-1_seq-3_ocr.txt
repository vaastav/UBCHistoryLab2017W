Chandler offered a resolution to appoint a committee of three to inquire into the disasters of Bull Run and Edwards Ferry. Lane, of Kansa3, moved to amend by inserting Springfield, Wilson's Creek and Lexington. Chandler said he hoped the resolution would not be amended. Lane said the man most entitled to hon or had been punished. At Wilson's Creek, he perished, and was sacrificed because he was not relieved when he could have been. The people want to know whether the gallant General Lyon was sacrificed. They want to know why regiments were seat" to Cairo, instead of his relief, and why the army moved along at a snail's pace to reinforce Col. Mulligan. People wan.ed to know the natoes of those who permitted these things, and in his opinion they would not have to look far for the man who permitted the sacrifice of Gen. Lyon. Lane's amendment was dis agreed to. Grimes offered a substitute to appoint a committee of two members of the Senate and three members of tbe House to investi gate the cause of the disasters to our arms. On motion of Fessenden, the subject was postponed until to-morrow. Wilson gave notice that he should to morrow introduce a bill to abolish sutlers in the volunteer forces. Mr. Grimea moved to take up the reso lution to investigate the case of Col. Miles. He said a Committee of Inquiry had found that Col. Miles was intoxicated to a certain extent, enough to justify Col. Richardson to apply epithets to him, but not enough to remove him from command. He wanted til the facts of tbe Committee to go to the people. Agreed to. Mr. Trumbull introduced his bill for con fiscating property and giving freedom to the slaves of rebels. He said it provides for the absolute and complete forfeiture for ever to the United States of every species of property, real and personal, wherever situ ted within the United States, belonging to persons beyond the jurisdiction of the Uni ted States, or civil process in the ordinary mode of judicial proceeding in consequence of the present rebellion, who, during its ex istence, shall take up arms against the Uni ted States, or in any way aid or abet the rebellion. This forfeiture to be in force against property in the rebellious districts through the military power, and all prop erty of other persons of the United States, where the judicial power is not obstructed by the rebellion through tbe courts ; and that tbe proceeds ot the property of each individual seized and forfeited, be subject to the just claims of loyal citizens, and to be held for the benefit of loyal citizens des poiled of property by the rebellion, and to defray the expenses incurred in its sup pression. Tbe bill also forfeited the claims of all rebels and those who give them aid and comfort, to tbe persons they hold in slavery. The bill declares that slaves thus forfeited shall be free, and makes it the duty of the President to provide for the colonization of such as may be willing to go to some t;op ical country, where they may have the pro tection of the government, and be secured in all the rights and privileges of free men. The property belonging to traitors, or those giving them aid or comfort, who may be convicted by judicial tribunals, is to be forfeited on their conviction the real es tate for life and personal property forever. Mr. Trumbull made a lengthy argument in support of the bill. The bill was ordered to be printed, and referred to the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Clark gave notice that he should offer an amendment to the fugitive slave bill. The Senate then went into Executive ses sion aud adjourned till Monday. Washington, Dec. 5. House. The Hpeaker announced vacancies in several of the standing committees, which have beeu tilled as follows: Wuyt and Means Cooper and Maynard. Judiciary Wilson. Territories Steele.

Mr. Gurley offered a resolution which was adopted, requesting tbe Committee on the judiciary to inquire if a telegraphic censorship of the Press has beeu established in this city; if so, by whose authority and by whom it is now controlled ; to report if such censorship has not been used to re strain wholesome political criticism and discussion while its professed and laudable object has been to witthold from the enemy infurmat'on in relation to tbe movements of the army. Mr. Stephens submitted a series of reso lutions referring the various branches of the President's message, to tbe appropriate com mittee t. Mr. Arnold moved that that part relating to the defense and fortifications of the great lakes and harbors be referred to a select committee of nine members. Mr. Gurley said it was intended on one side that the Great West and Northwest should not be ignored ; and on the other that the subject of defenses concerned not a section but the entire country. The qaestion was referred to a select committee. The resolutions as thus amended were adopted, together with one introduced by Mr. Blair of Missouri, referring that portion of the message referring to the colonization of slaves taken from armed rebels, to a se lect committee of seven. Mr. Lovejoy of Illinois introduced a bill proposing to repeal all laws requiring passes from persons of color going north ward, to take immediate effect.

") Washington, Dec. 4th, 1861. j Major General Geo. B. McClellan, Wash ington. General : I am directed by the Presi dent to call your attention to the following subject: Persons claimed to be held to service or labor under the laws of the State of Virginia, and actually employed in hos tile service against the Government of the United States, frequently escape from the lines of the enemy's force and are received within the line3 of the army of the Potom ac. This Department understands that such persons afterwards coming into the city of Washington, are liable to be arrested by the city Police, upon the presumption arising from color that they are fugitives from, service or labor by the 4th section of the act of Congrees, approved August 6, 1S61, entitled " an act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes." Such em ployment is made a full and sufficient answer to any further claims for service or labor. Persons thus employed and escaping, are received into the military protectiou of the United States, and their arrest a3 fugitives from labor or service, should be immediate ly followed by military arrest of the parties making the seizure. Copies of this eotn munication will be sent to th - Mayor of Washington and to the Marshal of the District of Columbia, that any collision be tween the military and civil authorities may be avoided. I am, General, Your verv obedient servant, M. 11.
