The Wanamakcr family moved from Philadelphia to Kosciusko Coun ty, Tnd., for two years, but returned In 18D6. Closo conllnement behind the counter affected Mr. Wanamaker's lungs and ho was sent to a Minnesota farm, where he recovered rapidly. His simple, clean Ideals of life mado him singularly Immuno from Illness for 1 1 'j vii ins uaja. For two years he was a salesn an In Tower Hall, a clothing store, llo de lighted In meeting "hard prospect cus tomers," especially those from the country who were shirked by more experienced salesmen, it was told of him that ho carried chewing gum or roasted chestnuts In his pockets and made hla approach on tho rural visi tors by munching candy or nuts with them ns they went over the stock. He became the most successful sales man In the store. lie started a trade Taper, Everybody's Journal, which was given away for advertising pur poses and wrote all of It himself. When ho was twenty-tour, soon after ho'had married Mary H. Brown, ho and her brother, Nathan Brown, formed tho partnership of Wanamak cr and Brown. Out of his wages and his salary as Secretary of the Young - . , i., .1 Men's Christian Association Mr. Wanamaker Ir.id saved J2.000. His brother-in-law had almost as much.

Their first day's busi ness was 521: their total for their first year was $21,000. In those days It was the custom for salesmen '.o havo a minimum price below which they must not sell marked in secret code on tho ticket on the goods; they wero to get as much morn ax they could.

Mr. Wanamaker was the first to fcctablish in tins country tho "goods marked plainly with ono price, to be aold at that price only." Ho fol lowed It with the announcement that any customer could return goods that wero unsatisfactory and get his money back. This policy came to lie known !.s the Wanamaker Plan, and botn policies ai u now almost universally adopted Under the time-saving ef fect of the one price policy ho was able to shorten tho working day .for his clerks fiom thirteen hours to ten ours or less In the first few weeks of Wana maker and Brown's Oa Hall Store they could not afford a delhery wagon and Mr. Wanamaker and Ida partner and clerks took turn. making the day's deliveries with a pm a cart after tho storo closed in the owning.

Mr. Wanamaker always had time to give to civic, religious and social nffalrs. He was a member of the Christian Commission In the Civil War. Ho was one of tho most en thusiastic organizers of the Philadel phia Exposition of 1S76; he was among tho foremost at tho time of nls death 1 working for the Philadelphia exposition or 1926. He was elected President of the World Sunday School Association at tho Toklo convention of 1920. Ho was for many years Chairman of the Flnanco Committee of the Board of Education of Philadel phia. Ho was active In Republican politics as a worker and adviser, but declined to run for office; ho declined a nominetlon to run for Congress in 1882 and in 188G declined to run for Mayor of Philadelphia. Ho was a member of tho Republican National Committee in tho HarrIson-Cle!land campaign. President Harrison mado him Post master General In spite of hostile criticism that Mr. Wanamaker had no experience qualifying him for the work. Ho answered It by reorganizing Post Office methods along the line of his merchandising. Ho Increased the fast mall service, arranged for the classification of foreign mails at sea. thereby speeding delivery, and urged tho parcel post and postal savings policies which wero adopted years later. He was the head of Bethany Sunday School In Philadelphia with 6,000 members. Every Sunday he attended from eight to twelve meetings of tho Sunday School and the brotherhood of Andrew and Philip. Ho founded tho Presbyterian Hospital in Phila delphia and the Penny Savings Bank and supported many educational mis sions in tho Par East.

Ho faced tho approaching end of his long life serenely. Only last June ho sent a telegram to Cantor William Armhold, celebrating his ninety-third birthday at Atlantic City, saying: "Ago Isn't anything but tho blessing of Uod." E'S PUT UP TO 

HARDING (Continued) something which was and is vital to tho Harding Administration ratifica tion of Its first big international action. Former Premier Clcmenceau's vi.dt contributed a friendly touch to a con troversial atmosphere, but until the Government of Premier Polncaie shows the same flaxlbiltty in policy as did M. Clcmenceau in pcrsonul contact with America theio will bo little chance of convincing the Har ding Administration that even a slight (lepiirtiiro from Us policy of seclusion would be of any avail at this time. Were France to manifest a more tractable attitude, there is no telling what progress might be made towaid winning tho co-operation of President Harding and Secretary Hughes. The insertion by tho President In his recent message of a direct hint that America would like to sen the principle uf the Four-Power Pact ap plied to Europe was not an necident. It had a put pose. No ono will admit that It was nn overturn to France, tho expiesMon of a hopo that France would ratify the Nnxal Arms Tiealy and open tho way to fuilhor steps In International conference with America included. But that Is the meaning at tached to it by most of tho diplomat who have cabled their Foreign Offices about It. And they think It Is one of the most significant steps that hs been taken Mr. Harding since the Arms Conference met a year ago. The ambition of the Harding Art ministration, of course is to fulfil the pledge made for some kind of assocta 

MAUDE ADAMS HOME; REFUSES TO TALK ABOUT HER PLAN FOR FUTURE MAUDE, ADXMS Miss Maud Klskadden, as her name appeared on tho passenger list, but In ternationally known as Maudo Adams of tho American stage, who returned yesterday on the Celtic, refused to oe Interviewed or photographed. Asked as to her plans for tho future and whero sho bad been while abroad, she replied: "Pleaso don't bother me. I have nothing to say." Miss Adams's veil was so thick that It- was Impossible to distinguish her. Had It not been that an officer In formed reporters of her presence on board, sho would havo left the vessel unrecognized. tion of nations in placo or the alleged super-government for the League of Nations. The latest development is the Idea of making a five-power or six-power pact in Europe to include the United States, Germany, Great Britain, France, Italy and probably Belgium, to bind themselves mutually to respect each other's rights. Such a guarantee by Franco that It would respect the territorial Integrity of Germany and such nn assurance that tho Germans would be committed against an Invasion of Franco would not carry with It an obligation upon the six powers to tako sides If the treaty were violated, but would mean an instant conference wherein moral suasion would bo applied on the principle of investigation. Mr. Har ding's chief idea on International af fairs is the Bryan idea of resting agreements on moral rather than physical lorcr. Europe's pita for American aid In solving the reparation problem may hasten the day for tho proposal of such a treaty. Franco can help ma terially by ratifying the arms treaties. Between now and the postponed con ference of the Allied Premiers in Jan uary something may be expected from the Washington Government a move toward participation, based, of course, on tho thought that Europe roust soon mako a beginning on her economic problem or such foreign trade as the United States has may bo materially impaired. CABINET DISCUSSES EUROPEAN AFFAIRS llnnllliK lIHIi'W Munition l)c miuiiN Help of TIiIm Nation, WASHINGTON. Dec 12 Tho Ameri can ijovrrnment Is active by trying lo hrlnc nbout an adjustment of the seri ous European situation, it was declared on high authority at the White House to-day. This statement was made following '.he revelation that President Harding and his cabinet, at their inee'lng to day had an extended dii-eiisslnn on old world affairs. This undoubtedly In nlcd i he failure of the London eonfei enre of European Premleis. The While House spokesman said this government Is doing cerythlnK it can to bring nbout a settlement in Europe A satisfactory adjustment of the nio.U pressing problems abroad, including tho German reparations difficulty, is a most vital need to the world, the administra tion official said. However, it is believed that It would lm unwise to reveal nt the present time lust what the Kovcrninent is doing in the European situation, according to thfi Whim llnuse stiitemcnt. Presldint Harding believes that the nrinelnln nf iho Foil r-Power Pucifle Tact, negotiated nt the Washington Conference last year, might "reason ably be applied elsewhere with wonder fill re.nnlls." This comment came from the While House in amplification of a similar sug gestion indo by the President in his Htiminl mersiice to Congress, rile I'resl dent Is "wholl slnrere" 'n his hope thnt some further peai f preserving compact may be m counted, n was said

CONSUL AT MALTA, SHOT AND WOUNDED (Continued) to a madman, as Consul Mitchell was not known to hnvo nn enemy. Another report Is to the effect that his assailant was a maltese nursing n fancied grievance against tho Amer ican Goernmcnt, uftcr being dishon orably discharged from the American Ann). Mason Mitchell was ono of tho most picturesque characters In New York during tho lato nineties and early 1900's. having been at various .times j United States Consul, Rough Rider, actor, manager, hunter, scout, tour ist und writer, und nmong other ex citing Incidents In his life was an attempt at suicide through Jealousy of an actress while he was an actor. Mitchell was quite well known be fore ho enlisted In Roosevelt's Rough Riders during tho Spanish-American War, but ho cume Into moro promi nence, when, as a member of Troop K, known as the mllllonalro troop, ho was badly wounded In the attack on Saptiago. As tho newspapera put It In those days, Mitchell belonged "to a millionaire troop, but he la not a millionaire: he Is an actor." Born In Hamilton, N. Y.. In 1859, he went on the stage at the ago of eight een, at the famous old Broadway Theatre In this city. Ho played with Edwin Booth. Lawrence Barrett and John McCuIIough, later becoming lead ing man with Mme. Modjeska. Ho oc- companted Mary Anderson during her theatrical engagements In Great Brit ain, and at one time managed the Gar- rlck Theatre. He was Chief of Scouts In the Can adian Government through the Rid rebellion and was promoted for gal lantry In action. When the Spanish- American War was declared ho was one of tho first to join tho Rough Riders. Beforo this, howover. Mr. Mitchell had travelled extensively In South America and tho South Sea Islands, writing of his experiences. In the latter placo he was a com panion of Robert Louis Stevenson. W hen Theodore Roosevelt was nomi nated for Governor Mitchell took the stump for him and, wlren Roosevelt became President Mitchell was named American Consul at Zanzibar, serv ing from 1902 to 1905. Following that appointment he acted successively as Consul nt Chungking, China; Apia, Samoa; Queenstown, Ireland, and Malta, Maltese Island. When tho Eu ropean war was declared ho loak over tho British and French Interests at German Samoa, tho colony having been captured by tho British. While ho was American Consul In Ireland he narrowly escaped being shot. Ho was riding In nn automobile with a friend In Cork during a dis turbance, when a group of soldiers or dered him to stop. Being somewhat deaf, he didn't hear tho challenge and tho soldiers levelled their rifles. The manager of the Hibernian Bank, who witnessed tho Incident, exclaimed: "For God's sake, don't shoot; that is the American Consul." Rifles were lowered und ho was permitted to pro ceed. Mitchell was educated at St. John's School, Manllus, N. Y., and Phillips Academy, Exeter, N. H. In 1905, he married Edna M. Ellis of Sun Fran cisco. 

BROTHER AND SISTER UNABLE TO CONVERSE He Cnniint spruk Uertnnn, she Doesn't Talk EnitlUli. Happy, though perplexed, was Albert BerB, twenty-seven, of Chicago, an as sistant circulation manager of tho Chi cago Tribune, when he greeted his seventeen-year-old sister upon her arrival from Hamburg aboard the Orblta yes terday. Berg last saw his sister In Germany In 1905. when sho was six months old. Ho lost nil trace of her until a few months ago, when tie learned she was In a tmoll town in Southern Germany. The brother met the sister n fth n handshake nml then. suddenly wound his arms around her neck "Gosh," he said lo nn agent of the line, she can t talk Encllsh und I can't tnlk German sae a little.

COMPEL UNIONS TO KEEP RECORDS PUBLIC (Continued) a parting shot, however, Mr. Untcr mycr said: "You'd better wrlto that resignation right away." Dloguardla Immediately wrote out his resignation. Beforo the next wit ness was called Mr. Untormycr recom mended that the case bf Michael Mul lln be turned over to the Grand Jury. Michael Mullln, business agent for International Local 719, called to tho stand by Mr. Untormycr, was greatly shocked when tho chief counsel flashed beforo him an admission signed 'by himself to tho effect that ho had misappropriated $819 while ho was a business agent for tho "In dependents." He admitted ho signed tho confession but denied ho got tho money. "I signed the paper to keep har mony In tho organization," sold Mul lln. "I didn't rcallzo It was a con fession of guilt, or I wouldn't have signed It. I was told that by signing the paper I would get tho money which had been collected by tho othors." Mullln said lie received $50 a week, but that ho had to "get It." By that ho meant ho had to earn It through new members who pay $26 In Instal ments, which Mullln keeps as his wages, ho said. Ho makes no ac counting for these collections, the only record being tho receipt stubs which aro sent to union headquarters, "There has been an awful lot of stealing in tho unions, hasn't there?" asked Mr. Untcrmycr. "Yes, there may be," replied Mul Un without a smile. "They havo mo down for it nnyhow." "It Is about time," said Mr. Unter inyer, "that vast sums of money paid by laboring men Into their unions should be protected by proper ac counting. It's about time the law stepped in ami tequlrcd simo book keeping of theso funds. Tho most hopeful sign of n per mancnt peace among the building trades was given when Mr. Untcr myer received assurances that the Independents nnd tho International Bricklayers' Helpers Unions, which havo warred bitterly for live years, have laid down their arms. Officials of the Independent:) declnrcd they have disbanded their locals, which nro seeking charters In tho International. An effort was mado by Mr. Untcr mycr to learn If tho Building Trades Employers' Association, had not lent grent aid to tho Independents so thut the labor market might bo kept In a constant state of turmoil and trouble. Charles Plttolllto, admitted that tlroro was something to this con tcntion. However, Giovanni Dloguar dla, formerly chief of 1 the Indcpen dents, would not commit himself. Ho said ho hud resigned ns the head of tho Independents and turned the or ganization over to tho International headed by Paul Vacarclll. Mr. Untcrmycr then made clear the object of to-day's session. Ho said ho wanted proof of the present peace, mado a part of the official record, so that if attempts were mado to destroy this tranquillity he would be In n posl tlon to beck tho culprits and bring them beforo the bar of Justice Preliminary to his opening an nouncement, In which ho said tho purpose of the meeting would be to make permanent. If possible, peaco In the building Industry, Mr. Unter m it, In Calling the committee to gether, said: "We havo met to-dny primarily to further investigate into the labor sit uation. At tho last meeting wo con stdered tho question of 'the threat ened strlko which Involved helpers and hod cajrlors and bricklayers. A strlko which was threatened at the time would have paralyzed all build ing operations In this city. Out of the hearings grew o truce. After the Hoard of Arbitration hud rendered a unanimous decision snm suit cf d s sension aiose. It was due to some extent.

"Secondly, we hue been advised Unit master plumbers cliilm $50,000.- 000 Is being lost every year because of some of tho regulations of plumb ers' unions. With respect to Hint cotnplnlnt we are after fuels. It will bo recalled that master plumbers were convicted of violation of tho anti trust law. Homo of them went to prison for terms that ucro entirely too short. Now th!so master plumb ers are making complaint not to this committee, but to tho newspapers nnd we are desirous of learning Just what basis. If any, there Is for thcoo complaints." Mr. Untcrmycr then referred to tho plasterers' unions. TJiero havo lieen corrections and Improvements In by laws nnd regulations since the Indict ment of tho lenders on charges of con spiracy. Similar Improvements hnvo been made In the plumbers' unions, he said. If these Improvements nro lived up to, Mr. Untermyer'snld and he fervently hoped tlioy would b they would havo u tendency to pacify con ditions In general and Iny the founda tion for n Just peace In the local Inbor world a peaco which would permit building without stint nnd n solution of tho housing problem so fur us tho building phnso of it Is concerned.
