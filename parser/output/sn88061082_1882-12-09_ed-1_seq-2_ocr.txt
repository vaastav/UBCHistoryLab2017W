MESSAGE. President Arthur sent his mes sage to Congress on ; Monday. The following is a brief synopsis of the more : important points touched upon: Tlie President preface bis message with review of the more important matters which appertain to our foreign and diplo matic Intercourse. The South American troubles are treated at length, and comprise a succinct review of what has been done by the government In the direction of an ami cable adjustment of the pending difficulties between the belligerents. The mission of Mr. Tresoott and Walker Blaine to Peru and Chill la recalled, and reference la made to the reports submitted by them, which were the subject of full discussion In congress and otherwise officially, last spring. The president notifies eongreas that, pur suant to the confirmation by the senate of the special commissioners nominated by him arrangements have been progressing for a commercial treaty with Mexico, and the departure of the commission will not be long delayed. Mention is made of several copyright and international treaties, nota bly with Hpain and Belgium. The president treats briefly the matter of the arrest and imprisonment of American citizens in English jails, reciting the fact of the arrests and of the Inquiry regarding them on behalf of this government. The president next reviews the operations of the treasury department. The excess of revenues over expenditures was IltoMlo.tH, and the amount applied to the reduction of the debt lsl.o6. The imports during the year amounted to 724,.',674. The balance of trade in our fa vor, in lace of our decreased exports aggre gated nearly t2C,000,0U0. The president congratulates the country upon its prosperity .and favorsaiidgid econ omy In public expenditures and a reduc tion of the Internal taxes. He indorses the recommendation of the secretary of the treasury that the tax on distilled spirits, tobacco and fermented liquors be reduced to a minimum consistent with sufficient revenue to meet largely in part the ordina ry demands of the government. He favors leaving spirits, tobacco and fermented liq uors to bear the burden. A considerable portion of the messaagels devoted to a report of the operations con nected with the refunding of the tbree-and-a-half-per-eent. bonds into three-per-oen'e. Touching the tariff, the president renews his recommendation of last year, that the existing laws need revision. He expresses the hope that the labors and the report of the tariff commission may be so enlighten ed as to facilitate congress in dealing with the subject. The president also renews his recommendation for the early retirement of the silver certificate, on the ground that tney iorm an unnecessary aaaiuon to me paper currency, which he thinks can be supplied In sufficient amounts to meet the demands of trade bv the national banks. That portion of tuu message which relates to the war department is of interest chiefly Decause 01 ine concurrence oy me prewueut in the views of tha secretary touching an increase of the army and the curtailment of appropriations lor tne puDiic wonts. The operations of the navy department are very briefly reviewed. The policy of the secretary of the interior, with regard to Indian affairs, meets the president's approval. He urges that such treatment of the Indians as will tend to civilise them, should be encouraged, and calls attention to the firm, and yet human isms influences which have Deen turown aiiout them during tbe past year, resulting In an exceptional season or freedom iroiu turbulence. Tlit nresident conKratuIataseongresaapon the ruotKiim of last season's law fur the sup pression of polygamy in tne lemwiy 01 Ltab. Tha estimates reaulred for tne payment of pensions for the current year is 

IIUO.OUO, 110. This is an increase over last year's es timates, accounted for the adjudication or a greater number of claims because of the in creased clerical force authorised at the last Mainn of nontrresa. The president recalls ine prosecution 01 tne star-route cases, unaer tne ueparuiiem of Instioe. announcing- the progress already made, and the determination of the admin istration to secure a full investigation and a aatisfuctorv outcome in the courts. He ae Clares it to be his purpose, as it is thatof the department, to obtain only a Just result, and one that will commend itself to intelli gent and fair-minded opinion. But the ad ministration wiU not suffer obstruction at tha hands of its own offiuial. as has been shown by removals from office as the pen alty of official departures from a oorreot course of action. The president takes care to emphasize the infliction of these penal ties as having been prompted wholly in a spirit of loyalty to the reasonable demands of the government, and he commends the action or tne department 01 justice iu una rekect, referring to the attorney-general's report and correspondence transmitted from the deoartment of lustice. The memaee concludes with a review of the operations of the commissioners of the I It: I. W 1AM UU1 UIH. , THE MEW 

PENITENTIARY. The Penitentiary Commission ap pointed by the last Legislature to take under advisement the question of removing the penitentiary from its present site in the city of Nash ville, to some other point iu David son county, which of course meant the building of a new and more commodious building, met at the Maxwell House in that city, on last Tuesday night, to examine plans and specifications for the new build ing, submitted by Mr. J. B. Cook, architect, of Memphis. Mr. Cook opened and explained his plans to the Commission, which call for a building with two thousand cells and all the latest and most approved appliances. It is said the building as proposed will cost about f 1,500, 000. The members of the Commis sion were much pleased with the plans of Mr. Cook and it is thought, will send in a report to the next Legislature, recommending the re moval of the penitentiary and the building of a new one according to Mr. Cook's designs. The demands that something be done by the next Legislature in this matter, are im mediate and pressing and it is sin cerely hoped by the people of the State that prompt action will be taken. We have received copies of the new Cincinnati Daily Democratic paper, the News, of which Mr. H. M. Doak is editor-in-chief, and Mr. Emmett G. Logan Managing edit or. The news is a good sized paper, clearly printed and its every de partment bearing evidence of a full and able corps of editors and news gatherers. There is said to be plen ty of room in Cincinnati for a live, active, enterprising Democratic pa per and it is safe to predict tbat the NewH will amply fill the bill. At its editorial columns will be largely filled by the writings of former Tennesseans, it is reasonable to suppose it will contain much about Tennessee affairs, and no doubt will have many readers in .this State. Siher Wedding of Mr. and Mrs. J.B. Ktllebrew Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Killebrewi than whom Montgomery county has no more highly esteemed and worthy citizens, celebrated their silver wedding at their country res idence on Monday night last. Of the happy event the Nashville Ban ner says : Col. and Mrs. J. B. Killebrew celebrated the twenty-fifth anni versary of their marriage at their delightful country residence, "Bos cobel." near Clarksville, last night. Only the intimate friends and rela tives of the family were present. It was an interesting occasion. A large number of handsome presents were displayed in the parlors. On the night of their marriage, just twenty-flve years ago, Col. Kil lebrew placed a ring on the finger of his wife "with a wish." The wish has never been told, and the ring has never been removed from Mrs. Killebrew's finger. Last night he presented his wife with another ring, as evidence of the renewal of the vows made a quarter of a cent ury ago. The presents consisted of a silver tea service, a dozen forks, a pair of elegant butter bowls, a silver bowl, pitcher, soap dish, tea set, fruit bowls, castor and many other beau tiful and valuable gifts. The occasion was one of great en joyment to those present. The young people engaged In dancing, while the older ones passed the eve ning in reviving the past, which is always more or leas pleasant and fascinating to all of us. The friends of Col. and Mrs. Kil lebrew join heartily in wishing them happiness and prosperity throughout the remainder of their Uvea. 

SCIENTIFIC MISSCEUANf. Late investigations of German scientists have shown that the elec tric light is not only healthier than other methods of illumination in leaving the air purer, but that it in creases the power of vision in somo respects, especially in distinguish ing colors. Red, blue, green and yellow are much more distinct un der this light than by daylight. Two Leipsic chemists have de vised & process for obtaining sugar iu a permanently liquid form. This result is said to be effected by add ing to a purified sugar solution a small quantity of citric acid, which cm bines with the sugar and de prives it of its tendency to crystal lize. Some experiments by M. Gaun tier appear to prove that human saliva possesses in a milder degree the same poisonous property as that of serpents. The human saliva in jected under the skin of a bird caused death, with symptoms very closely resembling those resulting from serpent bites. A new theory of the so-called fas cination of birds by snakes is that the bird mistakes the snake's tongue, which the reptile keeps in rapid and constant motion, for a lively worm, and watches it intent 1? with the anticipation of devour ing it. M. Pasteur has resolved to ex tend his studies in vaccination to yellow fever, with a view of deter mining whether or not the disease is due to parasites and can be guard ed against by inoculation. . A broad field of investigation is open to Pasteur, as it is suggested by his discoveries thus far that all conta gious maladies may be due to para sitic growths.the virulence of which may be so reduced by his method of inoculation as to render this class of diseases no longer a matter of dread. A Neopolitan gardener, after years of experiment, has produced a camclia with a delicate perfume, and he thinks it probable that these flowers may In the near future be so cultivated as to rival the rose in the fragrance of its odor. Mr. C. Shaler Smith has given the results of extensive observations in relation to the pressure exerted by the wind. The most violent gale recorded by him was at East St. Louis in 1371, when the wind overturned a locomotive, the force developed in so doing being no less than 93 pounds per square foot. At St. Charles a jail was destroyed in 1877, the pressure required being 84 pounds per square foot. At Marsh field In 1880 a brick mansion was leveled, the force necessary being 58 pounds per square foot. Below these extraordinary pressures, Mr, Smith instances numerous cases of trains blown off rails, and bridges, etc., blown down by gales of 24 to 81 pounds per square foot. In all the examples tne lowest rorce re quired to do the observed damage has been taken as the maximum power of the wind, although, of course, it may have been higher. Enthusiasts who make a special study of sun-spots and attendant phenomena believe that the corner stone of a new science is being laid by discoveries pointing to an inti mate connection between solar and terrestrial meteorology. Just what the connection is they are not able to clearly define, although electric, ity is suspected of being the agent through which the effects are mani fested upon our planet. It is known that the gaseous envelope of the sun is affected by eruptions of such pro digious magnitude as to be utterly beyond our power of conception, these disturbances appearing to us in the form of rapidly changing spots and protuberances. The eras of the spots, or sun-storms, occur at remarkably regular intervals, a complete cycle of the various stages of activity from maximum to mini mum and again to maximum being performed in about eleven years the so-called ''sun-spot period." The sun-spot physicists claim a co incidence spf the periods of maxi mum spots and years of great at mospheric and physical disturbance in the earth. The present has been a year of great solar disturbances, while It has been marked by vio lent storms and earthquakes upon our globe. Further than this, these scientists claim to have recently de tected by simultaneous observation minor atmospheric changes as the result of corresponding movements in the sun. Many difficulties at tend these observations, but the Astronomer Royal for Scotland and others believe that the state of the sun will some day become an im portant factor in our weather fore casts and calculations. On Monday night last, Deputy Sheriff Joe Gerhart boarded the South bound train at this point, and .succeeded in arresting two men named Wm. Edwards and Chas. Ingram, upon a warrant sworn out before a magistrate for an assault with intent to kill, a Mr. White, living in Dist. No. 4, this county. Edwards and Ingram were making for Texas, at the time of their cap ture, in company with three other men from the same neighborhood, who purchased tickets for them selves and the two named, at this point. Deputy Gerhart was at the depot in this city, on the night named execting the men to take the train here, this they failed to do, but upon finding out that the others had purchased two more tickets than needed, he rightfully surmised that Edwards and In gram would board the train at some point below here. He accordingly took the train himself and was re warded by seeing his men come aboard tho train at Palmyra, when he made the arrest and brought the men back to town on the 11 o'clock freight and lodged them in jail to await the action of the grand jury. There are said to be other parties connected with the assault and the affair has created a good deal of ex citement in No. 4. This capture was a neat piece of work on the part of Deputy Gerhart and goes far to enhance his reputation as a wide awake and efficient officer. Ben Butler declares be is not a candidate for the United States Senate. Ben has been too long get ting into the Gubernatorial chalr.to want to desert it so soon. WABIIIUTO!r 

LETTER. The First Day mt the Sesslca. A View from ma Reporter's Cat tery. Tab lain x VlTSSt. (From our regular Correspondent.) Here we are again, looking down from the unclouded heights of the Reporter's Gallery, upon the Con gress of the United States. Below are the chosen representatives of fifty millions of the most progress ive people in the world. The House has not been called to order, and for this reason perhaps, is in great dis order. Maine is shaking hands with Texas: Western heartiness and Southern warmth are actually pat ting each other .on the back, from Oregon to Florida ; while Massa chusetts and South Carolina have half lost their individuality in this common Hall of States. We see no political sections or bi sections yet ; no shades of blue and gray. All are moving, writhing, talking, laugh ing, and greeting each other with the abandon of boys returned to the campus of their Alma Mater after a long separation. And what an eventful separation it has been! But see, the hand on the dial plate points to eleven. The sharp rat-ta tat of the gavel is heard. To your seats, Legislators ! Divide your selves antagonistically, irreconcila bly, politically, North, South, East, West, tariff and anti-tariff, Repub lican and Democrat, while the pale chaplain intones a blessing on your common country, the United States, amen ! ; .now, gentlemen, perform your promises made on the hustings and proclaimed in the platforms, to say nothing of your unpublished prom ises of place and preferment, that you should never have made, to in fluential constituents, and above all, be vituous, and the country will be happy. It is too early to foretell the course of legislation. Influential members and Senators do not hesitate to ex press their views, but the views of legislators do not always result in accomplished legislation. There is a wide consensus of opinion among the Republicans that there should be an almost total abolition of in ternal revenue duties, but it is be lieved that a majority of Congress will oppose any change in the whis ky, beer and tobacco taxes, which make the bulk of the internal reve nue assessment. A large element of the Republican side of the house and Senate, whether tariff men or free traders are opposed to any re duction whatever on whisky and tobacco, though they may consent to a slight reduction on the latter It is believed that no comprehen sive review ol the tann schedules will be made, but it is possible that the tariff may be removed from a dozen or two articles on which there js universal agreement. There will doubtless be much discussion of the civil service re form question, and it is probable that a bill fixing the tenure of office during good behavior for a stated term of years will be passed. The second trial of the Star-route cases is set for to-day in the Crimi nal court. By reason of the recent developments, public interest in these cases has been much intensi fied. The selection of the new jury will be watched with the most vig ilant scrutiny, both by the govern ment counsel and the counsel for the defense. Public sentiment is strong that a convn-tion is sure to follow this second trial, and the counsel for the government express the utmost confidence that such will be the result. The govern ment counsel aver that they have additional and exceedingly impor tant testimony of a most convinc ing character to offer. The defend ants are very frequently seen in public places, but they look much subdued and have little to say. Washington, Dec. 4, 1881 We learn of a serious accident which befell a young man named Met Giles, living near Garrettsburg in the southern part of Christian county, Ky., on Monday last, by which he suffered the loss of a leg. He was driving a four mule team and was about starting to Hopkins ville, when his lead mule became unmanageable, running around and in some way tripping the mule he was riding, throwing it to the ground, entangling young Giles in the gear and badly fracturing one of his ankles. The fracture was of such a nature that his leg had to be amputated, which was accordingly done by Dr. Clardy of the neighbor hood. Police Regulations. The Board of Mayor and Alder men met in regular monthly session on weciuesuay evening last (tne time of meeting having been chang ed from the first Monday in each month to the first Wednesday night in each month) at Citylail. The regular monthly reports of the vari ous city officers were read and ap proved, bills audited, and much other routine business transacted The only business of especial public interest was the regulation of the hours of duty for the night and day police. It peems that under an old custom, ratherthan any stated law on the subject, the day officers were in the habit of coming on duty at sun-up in the morning and re maining until sun-down in the af ternoon, and the night officers not until 9 o'clock at night. This cus tom, as it will be seen, leaves the city without any police protection from sun-down until 9 o'clock at night, probably the most important hours of the twenty-four when the city should have police surveillance. This matter was brought to the at tention of the Board, and on Wednesday night they passed a res olution instructing the Citv Mar shall and Captain of Police to see that this intermission in the hours of duty were filled by the force In such a manner as they thought best. This order was passed preliminary to an ordinance upon the subject to be reported at the next meeting by the police committee. Some of the police will now be on duty at all hours. It seems as if the tax on tobacco ' is destined to be soon removed. The House Ways and Means Com mittee agreed upon a bill, on Tues day, to remove the tax upon tho weed in all its forms, the bill to take effect Jnly 1st next. ahe physicians', claims allowed by the Garfield Board of Audit were as follows: Dr. Bliss $6.500. ' Atr- new and Hamilton $5,000 each, Rayburn and Boynton $4,000 each, Edson $3,000. Dr. Bliss refuses to accept the allowance of the com mission and states that he will bring suit for his claim and prove the justness of it by eminent physi cians from different parts of the country. His books are said to show that his practice is worth $25,000. : The Courier-Journal, of a recent date, says: "Members of Congress who have arrived in Washington, and taken in the situation, concede the election of Mr. Carlisle as speak er of the House in the Forty-eighth Congress. . The Ohio Editorial Association was banquetted last night, at Chat tanooga, by the Iron, Coal and Manufacturers' Association of that city. It is believed that nothing of great importance will be done by the present Congress, beyond the passage of the necessary appropria tion bills.' Noah S. Smith, Deputy Collec tor of Internal Revenue, at Mem phis, has absconded, leaving a deficit in his accounts of $1,600. Hon. , M. C. Butler, United States Senator from South Carolina, was re-elected to the Senate on Tuesday. According to the new census there are in round numbers 10,000, 000 families in the United States. Ex-Senator McDonald, of the Indiana, will, it is said, spend winter in Washington. Thurlow Weed's Mother. Sunday's Conrier-Joumal.
