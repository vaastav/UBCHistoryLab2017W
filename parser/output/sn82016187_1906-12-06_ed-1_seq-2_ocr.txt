THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE A State Paper Brisiling With Points Allegations Theories Decla rations and Recommendations with brief statement i Tlie Message opens a ment of our prosperity and the good vork done by Congress and plunges at once into recommendations The first 1s for a law prohibiting corporations Vrom contributing to campaign ex spenses The next is to give the Gov ernment the right of appeal In certain criminal cases This has special rcfer lsence to cases under the Interstate Com i inerce laws Next lie favors the re striction of the power of injunction A vigorous denunciation is made of lynch Jaw With reference to this he says Ict Justice He Snlft and Sure 1 Evil will surely come in the end to both races if we substitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the mem bers of the race good and bad alike There is no question of social equalit J or negro domination involved only the question of relentlessly punishing bad men and of securing to the good man the right to his life his liberty and the pursuit of his happiness as his own qualities of heart head and hand enable If l to rrhiove it Ktfr colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal and above all the negro criminal who commits the dreadful crime of rape and it should be felt -as in the highest degree on offense against the whole country and against the col ored race In particular for a colored man to fail to help the officers of the law in hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such in famous offender Moreover in my judgment the crime of rape should al ways be punished with death as is the case with murder assault with intent to commit rape should be made a capi tal crime at least in the discretion ot the court and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense while the trial should be so conducted that the victim need not lie wantonly shamed while giving testi mony and that the least possible pub licity shall be given to the details The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just co much a loosening of the bands of civ ilization that the spirit of lynching in evitably throws into prominence in th community all the foul and evil crea tures who dwell therein No man can take part In the torture of a human being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered Evco lynching means just so much moral de terioration in all the children who have any knowledge of it and therefore just so much additional trouble for the nest generation of Americans Let justice be both sure and swift but let it be justice under the law and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob A plea is made for education for the Negro and the demagogs who preach race hatred are severely denounced CInMM Ilntreil In dealing with both labor and cap Jtnl with the questions affecting both corporations and trades unions there is one matter more important to remem ber than aught else and that Is the inr finite harm done by preachers of mere discontent These are the men -who seek to excite a violent class hatred c ngalnst all men of wealth They seek to turri wise and proper movements for Jthe better control of corporations and for doing riway with the abuses cohr nectcd with wealth into a campaign ot hysterical excitement andTaisehood n which the aim is to inflame to madness the brutal passions of mankind The sinister demagogs and foolish vision are always eager to undcri take such a campaign of destruction sometimes seek to associate themselves with those working for a genuine re form in governmental and social ods and sometimes masquerade as such reformers in reality they are the worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate just as the purveyors of sen sational blander in newspaper or maga zine or the worst enemies of all men who are engaged in an honest effort to Tjettcr what is bad in our social and governmental conditions To preach hatred of the rich man as such to carry on a campaign of slander and invective against him to seek to mislead and Imlame to madness honest men whose lives are hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will per mit them to appreciate the danger in the doctrines preached all this is to commit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy princi ple and tradition of American National life Moreover while such preaching nnd such agitation may give a liveli hood and a certain notoriety to some of thoe who take part In it and may result In the temporary political suc cess of others in the long run every such movement will either fail or else vill provoke a violent reaction which will itself result not merely in undoing the mischief wrought by the demagog and the agitator but also in undoing the good that the honest reformer the true upholder of popular right has painfully and laboriously achieved Cor ruption is never so rife as in communi ties where the demagog and the agi tator bear full sway because in such communities all moral bands become loosened and hysteria and sensational ism replace the spirit of sound judg ment and fair dealing as between man and man A drastic and thoro child labor law is recommended for the District of Co lumbia and the Territories iinpIojrr Liability The Employers Liability law passed tiy the last Congress was excellent but did not go far enough In spite of all precautions exercised by employers there are unavoidable accidents and even deaths Involved In nearly every line of business connected with the mechanic arts This inevitable eacrlfice of life may be reduced to i minimum but it cannot be completely eliminated It Is a great social Injus tice to compel the employe or rather the family of the killed or disabled vic tim to bear the entire burden of such an Inevitable sacrillce In other words society shirks its duty by laying the Whole cost on the victim whereas the injury comes from what may be called the legitimate risks of the trade Com pensation for accidents or deaths due in any line of Industry to the actual conditions under which that Industry is carried on should be paid by that por tion of the community for the benefit of which the Industry Is carried on that Jsby those who profit by the Industry Jf the entire trade risk Is placed upon the- employer he will promptly and properly add it to the legitimate cost of production and assess It proportion ately upon the consumers of his com modity It Is therefore clear to ray mind that the lav should place this entire risk of a trade upon the cm ioer Neither the Federal law nor i3 far as 1 am informed the State laws ceallng with the question of employers liability are sufficiently thorogolngl The Federal law should of course include employes In Navy iards Arsenals and the like A Strike Conirnlxnlon A recommendation is made for the passage of a bill to provide the machln ery for a compulsory Investigation of controversies between employers and During the 20 years between i 1881 and 1900 there were labor dis turbances affecting 117509 establish S ments and throwing out of work 0105- i 694 employes These involved a loss to employers of 143000000 and to em ployes of 307000000 making a total of 450000000 with a great loss to the public and anguish and suffering en dured by wives and children It is be lieved that this can bo avoided by the exercise of a Judicial spirit by a disin terested body representing the Federal Government In this age of great cor porate and labor combinations neither side should be left completely at the mercy of the stronger party Conl lnnels The President has temporarily with drawn from settlement all lands which the Geological Survey has indicated us probably containing coal Legislation should provide that these lands should remain under the ownership of tho United States with permission to work them by private Individuals under a royalty system the Government keeping such control as to regulate prices and also the rates charged by common car riers The coal like the forests should be treated as the property of the public HeculuttBsr Corporations The present Congress has taken long strides in the direction of securing proper control over corporations en gaged In Interstate business The pas sago of the Railway Rate bill Pure Food bill etc mark an important ad vance in the proper direction It may be well to wait to see how these laws operate yet legislation which seems im mediately desirable is that to put a date on the packing house labels and for charging the cost of the inspection to the packers The Railroad Rate bill has falsified the prediction that it would ruin the railroads since those highways have all shown increased earnings and some of them unusual dividends while on the other hand there has been unheard of voluntary reductions in freight and fares More than 5000 tariffs have been adopted representing reductions from previous rates Experience has shown the Impossi bility of securing concerted action by nearly half a hundred different State Legislatures and therefore there must be some more comprehensive and gen eral way of dealing with corporations This may he by a National license law but whate er form there should be a control which -will prevent excessive overcapitalization and will compel the disclosure of ownership of properties put a stop to inordinate profits by fav ored individuals and promote the in terests of the general public the stock holders and the wageworkcrs Consoli dation need not be prevented but it should be controlled soas to bring no harm to the people The President saya So the proper antidote to the dan gerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such is to secure by proper legislation and executive action the abolition of the grave abuses which actually do obtain in connection with the business use of wealth under our present system or rather no system of failure to exercise any adequate con trol at all Some persons speak as If the exercise of such governmental con trol would do away with the freedom of individual initiative and dwarf in dividual effort This is not a fact It would be a veritable calamity to fall to put a premium upon Individual initia tive Individual capacity and effort up on the energy character -and foresight which it is so important to encourage in the individual But as a matter of fact the -deadening and degrading effect of pure socialism- and especially of IU extreme form communism and tho de struction of individual character which they would bring -about are in par achieved by the wholly unregulated competition which results In a single Individual or corporation rising at the expense of all others until his or it3 rise effectually checks all competition and reduces former competitors to a position of utter inferiority and subor dination Inheritance nnd Income Tnx The President devotes much space to the discussion of his proposed Inher itance and income tax of which the following Is the essential part The question of taxation Is difficult in any country but it is especially dim cult In ours with Its Federal system of government Some taxes should on every ground be levied In a small dis trict for use In that district Thus the taxation of real estate Is peculiarly one for the Immediate locality in which the real estate is found Again there is no more legitimate tax for any State than a tax on the franchises conferred by that State upon street railroads and similar corporations which operate wholly within the State boundaries sometimes in one and sometimes in sev eral municipalities or other minor di vlslono of the State But there are many kinds of taxes which can onl be levied by thi -General Government so as to produce the best results because among other reasons the attempt to Impose them in one particular State too often results merely In driving the cor poration or individual affected to some other locality or other State The Na tional Government has long derived Its chief revenue from a tariff on Imports and from an Internal or excise tax In addition to these there Is every reason why -when next our system of taxation Is revised the National Government should Impose a graduated income tax The man of great wealth owes a culiar obligation to the Slate because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of Government Not only should Impose a graduated Inheritance tax and If possible a graduated Income tax The man of great wealth owes a pe the way he leads his dally life and in the way he earns and spends his money but it should also be recognized by tho way In which he pays for the protection tne btale gives him On the one htmdf It Is desirable that he should assume his full and proper share of the burden of taxation on the other hand It Is quite as necessary that In this kind of taxation where the men who vote the tax pay but little of It there should be clear recognition of the danger of in augurating any such system save in a spirit of entire justice and moderation Whenever we as a people undertake to remodel our taxation system along the lines suggested we must make It clear beyond peradventure that our aim is to distribute the burden of supporting the Government more equltnbly than at present that we intend to treat rich man and poor man on a basis of abso lute equality and that we regard It as equally fatal to true democracy to do or permit injustice to the one as to do or permit Injustice to the other Xeedn I ong nnd Careful Study I am well aware that such a subject as this needs long and careful study In order that the people may become fa miliar with what Is proposed to be done may clearly see the necessity of proceeding with wisdom and self-re straint and may make up their minds just how far they are willing to go In the matter while only trained legisla tors can work out the project in neces sary detail But I feel that in the near future our National legislators should enact a law providing for a graduated inheritance tax by which a steadily in creasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift bequest or devise to anv individual or corporation It may be well to make the tax heavy in propor tion ns the Individual benefited is re mote of kin In any event In my Judg SHE 

NATIONAL TRIBUNE WASHINaONDlCTHURSDAY DECEMBER 6 190G ment the pro rata of the tax should increase very heavily with the increase of the amount left to any one Individual after a certain point has been reached It Is most desirable to encourage thrift and ambition and a potent source of thrift and ambition is the desire on the part of tho breadwinner to leave his children well off This object can be attained by making the tax- very small on moderate amounts of property left because the prime objeet should be to put a constantly Increasing burden on the inheritance of those swollen for tunes which It is certainly of no benefit to this country to perpetuate There can be no question of the ethical propriety of the Government thus determining the conditions upon which any gift or Inheritance should be received Exactly how far tho Inher itance tax would as an incident have the effect of limiting tho transmission by devise or gift of the enormous for tunes In question it Is not necessary at present to discuss It is wise that prog ress in this direction should bo gradual At first a permanent National Inher itance tax while It might be more sub stantial than any such tax has hitherto been need not approximate either in amount or In tho extent of the increase by graduation to what such a tax should ultimately be Income Tax In its incidents and apart from the main purpose of raising revenue an income tax stands on an entirely differ ent footing from an Inheritance tax btrausc it Involves no question of the perpetuation of fortunes swollen to an unhealthy size The question is In its essence a question of the proper ad justment of burdens to benefits As the law now stands It Is undoubtedly diffi cult to devise a National Income tax which shall be constitutional But whether it Is absolutely impossible Is another question and if possible it Is most certainly desirable The first pure ly Income tax law was passed by the Congress In 1861 but the most Impor tant law dealing with tho subject was that of 1894 This tho court held to bo unconstitutional The question Is undoubtedly very in tricate delicate and troublesome The decision of the court was only reached by ono majority It is tho law of the land and of course is accepted as such and loyally obeyed by all good citizens Nevertheless the hesitation evidently felt by the court ns a whole In coming to a conclusion when considered to gether with tho previous decisions on the subject may perhaps indicate tho possibility of devising a constitutional Income tax law which shall substantial ly accomplish the results aimed at The difficulty of amending the Constitution is so great that only real necessity can justify a resort thereto Every effort should be made in dealing with this subject as with the subject of the proper control by the National Govern ment over the use of corporate wealth in Interstate business to devise legisla tion which without such action Shall at tain the desired end but If this falls there will ultimately bo no alternative to a constitutional amendment Other Recommendation Strong recommendations are made for technical and industrial training for better irrigation and forest prcser vation for the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington for a uniform divorce law for a subsidy to American shipping with an indorsement of the bill now before Congress for currency roform in which the National banks should be permitted to issue notes in proportioh to their capital The rhlllpplnen The President most earnestly hopes that the bill to provide a lower tariff for or else absolute free trade In Phil ippine products will become a law -He believes thit no harm will come to any American Industry and while there will bo some small but real material benefit to the Filipinos the main benefit vrilM come ny the snowing made as to our purpose to do all In our power for their welfare He believes that our action In the Philippines has been abundantly justified because of the added dignity It has given us as a Nation by proving that we are capable honorably and eflK ciently to bear the International bur dens which a mighty people should bear and also because of the immense benefit that has come to the people of the Philippine Islands In these island he says we are steadily in troducing both liberty and order to a greater degree than their people havfr ever before known We havo secured justice V have provided an efficient police force and have put down ladron lsm Only in the Islands of Leyte and Samar Is the authority of our Govern ment resisted and this by wild moun

whether the self government thus granted will be In creased or decreased for If we have erred at all In the Philippines it has been In proceeding too rapidly in the After You Are Well - Rheumatism

Message on the subject The Army and Xavy I do not ask that we continue to increase our Navy I ask merely that it De maintained at its present strength and this can be done only if wo replace tho obsolete and outworn ships by new and good ones the equals of any afloat In any navy To stop building ships for ono year means that for that year the Navy goes back instead of forward In both the Army and the Navy there is urgent need that e erything possible should be done to maintain the highest standard for tho personnel alike as regards the officers and the enlisted men I do not believe that In any service there is a finer body of enlisted men and of junior officers than we havo In both the Army and the Navy Including tho Marine Corps All possible encouragement to tho enlisted men should bo given In pay and other wise and everything practicable done to render the service attractive to men of the right type They should be held to the strictest iibcharge of their duty and In them a spirit should be encour aged which demands not the mere per formance of duty but the performance of far more than duty if It conduces to the honor and the Interest ot the American Nation and In return the amplest consideration should be theirs Money should be appropriated to permit troops to he massed in body and exercised in manuvers particularly In marching Such exercise during the Summer just passed has been of incal culable benefit to the Army and should under no circumstances be discontinued If on theso practise marches and in these manuvers elderly officers prove unable to bear the strain they should be retired at once for the fact Is con clusive as to their unfitness for war that is for the only purpose because of which they should be allowed to stay In the service lie also recommends few Army posts and larger ones He praises the Gen eral Staff in the Army and the General Board In the Navy both being essential to the proper development and use of our military forces afloat and ashore Ho especially recommends In closing the National Board for the promotion of rifle practise and declares We should establish shooting gal leries in all the large public and mili tary schools should

KOYAIJ How Stallion nnd Buck Foaght Blindly to the Death Charles D G Robertss A Stranger to the Wild In tho December Century At about 2 oclock In the morning at that mystic hour when Nature seems to send a message to all her animate children preparing them for the ad vent of dawn tho white stallion got up shook himself stepped softly down to the brooks edge for a drink and then fell to cropping tho grass wherever it remained green The forest tho to a careless ear It might have seemed as silent as before had in reality stirred to a sudden ephemeral life Far off from some high rock a she fox barked sharply Faint muffled chirps from the thick bushes told of junkos and chicka dees waking up to see if all wa3 well with the world The mice set up a scurrying In the grass And presently a hlgh antlercd buck stepped out of the shadows and started across the open toward the brook The dark buck himself a moving shadow saw the stallion first and stopt with a loud snort of astonishment and defiance The stallion wheeled about eyed the intruder for a moment doubt fully then trotted up with a whinny of pleased interrogation He had no dread of the antlered visitor but rather a hope of companionship in the vast and overpowering loneliness of the alien nfght v - The buck however was inanythlng but a fricndlymooa His veins aflame with the arrogant pugnacity of the rut ting season he saw in the white stran ger only a possible rival and grew hot with rage at his approach With an impatient stamping of his slim fore hoofs he gave a challenge But to the stallion this was an unknown language Innocently he came up his nose stretched out in question till he was within a few feet of the motionless buck Then to his astonishment the latter bounced suddenly aside like a ball stood straight up on his hind legs and struck at him like lightning with those keen edged slim fore hoofs It was a savage assault and two long red furrows one longer and deeper than the other appeared on the stallions silky white flank In that instant the wanderers friend llncss vanished and an avenging fury took Its place His confidence had been cruelly betrayed With a harsh squeal his mouth wide open and lips drawn back from his formidable teeth he sprang at his assailant But the buck had no vain idea of standing up against this whirlwind of wrath which he had evoked He bounded aside lightly but hurriedly and watched for an oppor tunity to repeat his attack The stallion however was not to be caught again and the dashing ferocity of his rushes kept his adversary cease lessly on the move bounding Into the air and leaping aside to avoid those disastrous teeth The buck was await ing what he felt sure would come the chance to strike again and his confl dence in his own supreme agility kept him from any apprehension as to the outcome of the fight But the bucks great weakness lay in his ignorance his insufficient knowledge of the game he was playing He had no idea that his rushing white antag onist had any other tactics at com mand When he gave way therefore he went just far enough to escape the stallions teeth and battering fore feet The stallion on the other hand soon realized the futility of his present meth od of attack against so nimble an ad versary On his next rush therefore just as the buck bounced aside he wheeled in a short half circle and lashed out high and far with his steel shod heels The buck was just within the most deadly range of the blow He caught the terrific impact on the base of the neck and the forward point of the shoulder and went down as if an explosive bullet had struck him Before he could even stir to rise the stallion was upon him trampling battering squeal ing biting madly and the fight was done When the wanderer had spent his vengeance and paused snorting and wild eyed to take breath ho looked down upon a mangled shape that no longer struggled or stirred or even breathed Then the last or his right eous fury faded out The sight and smell of the blood sickened him and in a kind of terror he turned away For a few hesitating moments he stared about his little retreat and then find ing it had grown hateful to him he forsook It and pushed onward on the edge of the stream between the black Impending walls of the forest AVhnt In Soelnllxnif Philadelphia Bulletin A debating society in Manayunk of fered last week a
