NTKKNAT lON A I. A I I A I KS. The ICelatioiis of fit#- I oiled stales Wit!) the Various Foreign Cos tin trie*. flood will and cordiality have characterized our relations ami corres()ondence with other governments, and the year just closed leaves few inte, national questions of importance re maining unadjusted. No obstacle Is believed to exist that <aii long postjione the consid eration and adjustment of the slid (lending questions upon satisfactory and honort.ble terms. The .dealings of this government v.ith other states have Ueii and should always lie marked by frankness and sincerity; our purposes avowed, and our methods free from intrigue. This course has home rich fruit in the past and it Is our duly as a nation to preserve the heritage of good repute which a century of right dealing wit l< f< eign governments has secured to us. The Tan-American Congress. If is a matter of high significance and no less of congratulations, that the first year of the second century f .ur constitutional existence finds, as honored guests w ithin our own borders, the rep rertenlutiveH of all the indefn-ndent states of North ami Soiifh America, met together In earn est conference touching the hesf methods of per petuating and xpanding the relations of mutual interest and friemlllness exiting among them. That the opport unity thus afforded for promot ing closer international relations and the in creased prosperity of tin* states represented will be used for I lie mutual good of all I cannot per mit myself to doubt. Our people w ill await with interest ami confidence the results to How from so auspicious a meeting of allied and in a large part. Identical Interests. The recotniiM'iidalions of this international con ference of enlightened Ktal*smea will have ihe attention of congiess and its co-o|)eration iti the removal of unnecessary harriers to beneficial in tercourse lad ween the nat ions of America, hut while the commercial results, which it is lio|**d will follow this conference, arc worthy of pursuit and of the great Interest they have excited, it is believed that the crowning benefit will Is* found in tin* better securities which may he de vised for the maintenance of peace among all American nations, and settlement of contentions hy methods that a Christian civilization can ap prove. While viewing with Interest our national resources and products, t he delegates will, I am sure, find a higher satisfaction in the evidences of unselfish friendship, whieh every where attend the intercourse with our |>eople. Another international conference having great (KjHslhiltties for good has lately assembled and is now in session in this capilol. An invitation was extended hy the government under the act of congress of July It, IHHH. to all maritime nations to scud delegates to confer touching i he revision and amendment of the rules and regulations gov erning vessels, and to adopt a uniform system of marine signal ' The response to this invitation ha a been very general and very cordial, lich gates from twenty six nations are present in the conference, and they have entered upon i heir use ful work with great zeal,and with an evident ap preciation of its importance, go far as the agree ment to Is* reached may require h-gisialion togive n effect.

A similar issue is now pending with Portugal The IVlagoa Bay railway in Africa was con structed under a concession by Portugal to an American cim>'n. When nearly complc; and the road was M-ixed by the agents .f the Portugtteae government. Formal protest has been made through onr minister at I .is bon against this act amt no proper effort will Is? spared to secure proper relief The traditional good feeling between this coun try and The French Kepublle has received additional testimony in the [su-tlcl ;tion of our government and people in the in ternational exposition held at Pans, during the past summer. The success of our exhibitors has been gratifying. Tbe report of the commission will be laid before congress in due season. This government has accepted under proper re serve as to its policy in foteign territories, the in vitation of the government of Belgium, to take part in an international congress which opens at Brussel*, on the 16th of Noveral#er. for the purpose of devising measures to promote the abolition of the slave trade in Africa, to prevent the shipment of slaves by sea. Our interest in the extinction of this crime against humanity in the regions where it yet survives, has been increased by the results of emancipation within our own borders. With Germany, the most cordial relations continue. The ques tions arising from the return to the empire of Germans naturalized in this country are consid ered and disposed of in a temperate spirit, to the entire satisfaction of both governments. It is a source of great satisfaction tfc the in ternal disturbances of the republic of Hayti are at last happily ended, and tbai an apparently stable government has been constituted. It has le*‘*n duly recognized by the United States. A mixed commission is now in session in this capitol for the settlement of long standing claims against the republic of \ enezeala, and it is hojied that a satisfactory conclusion will be speedily reached. This government has not hesitated to express its earnest desire that the tioundary dispute now pending between Great Britain and Wmv-ula may be adjusted amicably and in strict accordance with the historic title of the parties. The advancement of the empire of Japan has been evidenced by the recent promulgation of anew constitution, valued for guaranti**! of lilierty and providing for a responsible ministry to conduct the government. It is earn*.stly rec ommended that judicial right and processes in Corea Ik* established on a firm basis by' providing the machinery necessary to carry our treaty stip ulations in that regard. The friendliness of The Persian Government continues to be shown by its generous treatment of Americans engaged in missionary labors and by the cordial disposition of the Shah to encour age the enterprise of our citizens in the develop ment of Persian resources. A discussion is In progress touching the juris dictional treaty rights of the United State * in Turkey. An earnest effort w ill Ik* made to define those rights to the satisfaction of both governments. Questions continue to arise in our relations with several countries in res|*ect to the Rights of Naturalized Citizens. Especially is this the cas* with France, Italy, Russia and Turkey, audio a less extent with Switzerland. From time to time earnest efforts have been made to regulate this subject by con ventions. An improper use of naturalization should not Is* jM*rmitted. but it is important that those who have lieeti duly naturalized should every where lie awarded recognition of the rights pertaining to citizens of the country of their adoption. The appropriateness of special conven tions for that pur|K)se is recognized in the treaties which tins got eminent hasconcliided with a num ber of EurojM-an States, and it is advisable that the difficulties, which now arise in our relations with other countries on the same subject, should be similarly adjusted. The recent revolution in Brazil, in favor of tin* establishment of a republican form of government is an event of great interest to the United States. Our minister ut Rio oe Janeiro, was at once instructed to maintain friendly diplomatic relations with the provisional government, and the Brazilian at this capital were instructed by the provisional government to continue their functions. Our friendly intercourse with Brazil has therefore suffered no interruption. Our minister has been further instructed to extend on tbe part of this government a formal and cordial recognition of the new republic so soon as the majority of the people of Brazil shall have signified their assent to its establish meat and maintenance. FIN A MIA 1. W hat flic Report of the Treasury Depart ment shows- Too Much Money. Within our own borders a general condition of prosperity prevails. Tin; harvests of the last summer were exceptionally abundant, and the trade conditions now prevailing seem to promise a successful season to the merchant and the man ufacturer and general employment to our work ing |H*ople. The report of the secretary of the treasury for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889, has been prepared and will be presented to con gress. it presents with clearness the fiscal ope rations of the governifteiu, and 1 avail myself of it to obtain some fuel s for use here. The aggre gate receipts from all sources for the year were s3K?J)9o,o6M.ttft, derived as follows: From customs $223,832,741 68 From internal revenue. 130.881,513 92 From miscellaneous sources.. . 32,335,803 23 The ordinary expenditures for the same iieriod were $281,996,615.60. \nd the total eX|H*nditures including the sinking fund were $329,579,929.25. Tiie exi '-ss of receipts over expenditures was. alter providing for the sinking fund 557,170,129.59. For tlie cum nt fiscal year the total revenues, act ual and estiniat I are $385,U00,0u0. and the or dinary expenditures actual and estiuiau*d, are $293.000,4Nhi, making, witli the sinking fund, a total expenditure of $311,321,116.99, leaving an estimated surplus of $43,678,883.01. During the fiscal year there was applied to 'I In- rurcliasc of Itonds in addition to those for the sinking fund. $90.45*1,- ITI.Xk and during tin* first quarter of tin* current year tin* sum of 

SJ7,B3S t UJI7.<7. all of which were credited to the sinking fund. Tin* revenues for t he fiscal year en<ling June do. IH9I. art* estimated hy the treasury <1- |artineiit at and the expenditures for the same period ineluding the sinking fund at $lll.-Ift), 177.70. Th's shows an estimated surplus for that year of $4d.5tJ9.5~*.J.d0, whieh is more likely to he increased than reduced when the actual transactions are written up. The surplus n l>lt urblng I lenient. Tin* existence of so large an actual and antici pated surplus should nave the immediate at ten lion of congress, with a view to reducing the re ceipts of the treasury to the needs of the govern incut as closely as may he. The collection of moneys not needed for public uses imposes an unnecessary burden upon our |M*ople, and the presence of so large a surplus in the public vaults is a disturi mg element in the conduct of private business. It has calks 1 into use ex|iedients for putting if in’o circulation of very questionable propriety. \V. should not collect revenue for the purpos of anticipating our bonds beyond the requirements of the sinking fund, but an; unap propriated surplus in tin* treasury shouhl be so iisimi as theie is no other law ful way of returning the money to circulation, and the profit realized by the goVernm ait offers a substantial advantage. The loaning ol public funds to the banks without interest upon the security of gov ernment bonds I regard as an unauthorized and dangerous expedient; it results in a tempor ary amt unnatural increase of too much Imiiking of'capital in favored localities, and eompels a cautious and gradual recall of the dejMjsits to avoid injury to the commercial interests. It is not to be expected that the hanks having these deposits will sell their bonds l tin* treasury, so long as the present highly beneficial arrange ment is continued. They now practically get interest both u|>on tie* bonds and their proceeds. No further use should he made of this method of getting the surplus int* circulation, and the de posits now outstanding s, *n.ld he gradually withdrawn and applied to the purchase •’> bonds. It is fortunate that such a use can **e made of the existing surplus, and for souk* l ime to come of,any casual surplus that may exist after congress has taken the necessary steps fora reduction of the revenue. Such legislation should 1h: promptly but very considerately enacted. THE 

TARIFF. The Most Promiuciit Question of the Ray llrletly Discussed. 1 recommend a revision of our tariff law. both In its administrative features and in the sehed ul*s. The need of the former is generally con *cded, and an agreement upon the evils and inconveniences to i e remedied aiu! tlu* best methods for their correction w ill proliaely not he difficult, I'niformitvof valuation at all our ports is essential, and effective measures dioufd be taken to secure it. It is equally deshablc that questions affect ing rates and ckissificat ions should is* promptly deckled. The preparation of anew schedule of custom duties is a matter T great d*lieaey. because of its effects ujxm the business of the country, of great difficulty hy reason of the wide divergence of opinion as to the objects that may be promoted by such legislation. Some disturbance of business may (terhaps result from consideration of this subject by congress, but this temporary ill effect will be reduced to a minimum by prompt action and assurance which th country enjovs that any necessary changes will be soon made as not to impair the just and reasonable oroteclio of our home in dustries The inequalities of the law should In* adjust'd. but the protective principle should In* maintained and firmly applied to the products of our farms jis well as our ships. These duties necessarily have relation to other things besides the public revenues. We cannot limit their effectn by fixing our eyes on the public treasury alone. They have a direct relation to home production. to work, to wages and to the com mercial independence of our country* and the wise and patriotic legislator should enlarge the tldd of his vision to include all of these The necessary reduction incur public revenues, can 1 am sun*. lx made without making the smaller burden more onerous than the larger by reason of the disabilities and limitations which the process of retinet ion puls upon both capital and labor. The free list van very safely le ex tended by placing thereon articles that do not offer injurious competition to such domestic pro ducts as our home lalxr can supply. Frw Tobacco ami spi its. The removal of the internal tax upon tobacco would relieve an important agricultural product from a burden which was imposed only Wans* our revenue from custom duties was insufficient for the public needs. If safe provisions against fraud can lie devised, the removal of the tax upon spirits used in the arts and manufacture, would also offer an unobjectionable method of reduction of the surplus. MONKV U VITERS \ Deerea**** In tin- i irculation of National t'unk Notes The >iiver Question. A table represented by the secretary of the UvHSiiry showing the amount of money of all kinds in circulation each yeai from lS7s to the present time is of interest- If appears that the amount of national Uuik notes in circulation has decreased during that perkxl 14.109.7:19. of which 557.795.549 is chargeable* to the last year The withdrawal of hank circulation will necessarily continue under existing conditions. It is proh j.'aie the adoption of the suggestions math' by the comptroller of the currency , viz ; That the mini mum dep* *sit tf bonds for th establishment of ! banks x' reduced. ami that an issue of holes to the i par value of the bonds lx' allowed, would help to | maintain the l*ank circulation; luit while this ■ w ithdrawal of bank notes has lx* *n going on there I has lx*en a large increase in amount of gold and silver coin in circulation and in the issues of gold : and silver certificates.

The Silver Question. 1 The law requiring the purchase by the treasury oC. two million dollars worth of stiver bullion each ! month. to lx? coined into silver dollars of 41£t& 1 grains has been observed by the department, tail I neither the present secretary nor any of las pre | deoeosors has deemed it safe to exercise the dis cretion by law. to increase the monthly purchase i to four milhon.dollars. When the law was enacted February 28. 1878. the price of silver in the mar ket was §1.20 4-10 per ounce, making the bullion value of the dollar 93 cents. SLice that time, the price has fallen as low as 91.29 e snts per ounce, reducing the bullion value of ti c dollar to T 0.6 cents Within the last few months the market price has somewhat advanced. On the first day of November last, the bullion value of the silver dollar w as 72 cents. The evil anticipations which have accompanied the coinage and use of the silver dollar have not been realized. Asa coin it has not had general use, and the public treasury has be**n compelled to stor* it. But this is manifestly ow ing to the fact that its paper representative is more convenient. . The general acceptance and use of the silver certificate show that silver has not been otherwise discredited. Some favorable conditions have contrilnited to maintain this •equality in their commercial use between the gold and silver dollars. But some of these arc trade conditions that statutory enactments do not control and of the continuance of which we can not be certain. I think it is clear that if we should make coin age of silver at the present ratio free, we must expect the difference iu the bullion value of the gold and silver dollars will be taken account of in commercial transactions and I fear tbe same re sult would follow any considerable increase of the present rate of coinage. Such a result would be discreditable to our financial management and disastrous to all business interests. We should not tread the dangerous edge of such a peril and indeed nothing more harmful could liappen to the silver interests. Any safe legislation upon iis subject must secure the equality of the two coins in the commercial uses. 1 have always been an advocate of the use of silver in our currency. We are large producers of that metal and should n t discredit it. To the plan which will Im* presented by the sec retary of the treiusury for the issuance of notes of certificates upon toe deposit of silver bullion at its market value, I have been able to give only a hasty examination owing to the press of other matters and to the fact that it has lM?eii so recently formulated The details of such a law require careful consideration, but the general plan suggested by him seems to satisfy the pur pose, to continue the use of silver in connection with our currency and at the same time to ob viate the danger * of w hich I have spoken. At a later day 1 may communicate further w ith con gress upon this subject. J >G M 

JEST IC A F FA IRS. General Review of National Matters Dur ing the Past Fiscal Year. The enforcement of tbe Chinese exclusion act has been found to be very difficult on the north western frontier. Chinamen landing at Victoria, find it easy to pass over tbe border, owing to the impossibility with force at command with the customs officers of guarding so long an inland line. The secretary of the treasury has author ized the employment of additional officers, w ho will Im* assigned to this duty, and every effort will be made to enforce the law. The dominion exacts a head tax of £5O for each Chinaman landed, and when these persons, in fraud of our law cross into our ter* itory and are apprehended, our officers do not know what to do w ith them as the dominion authorities will not suffer them to i*e sent back without a second payment of the tax. An effort will lie made to reach an under standing that will remove tills difficulty. Seal Fishing. The proclamation required by section 3. of the act of March 2. 1889, relating to the killing of sealsand other fur bearing animals, was issued by me on the 2ist day of March, aud a revenue ves sel was dispatched to enforce the laws and pro tect the interests of the United States. The es tablishment of a refuge station at Point Barrow, as directed by congress, was successfully accom plished . Coast Defense. Judged by modem standards we are practically without coast defenses. Many of the structures we have would enhance rather than diminish the perils of their garrisons if subjected to the tire of improved guns: and very few are so located as to give full effect to the greater range of such guns as we are now making for coast defenses. This general subject has had consideration in congress for some years, and the appropriation for the construction of large rifled guns, made one year ago, was. I am sure, the expression of a purpose to provide suitable works in which these guns might he mounted. An appropriation now made for that purpose would not advance the completion of the works beyond our ability to supply them with fairly effective guns. The se curity of our coast cities against foreign attack should not rest altogether in the friendly disposi t ion of other nations. There should be a second line wholly in our own keeping. I very urgently n >mmend an appropriation at this session for the construction of such works in our most ex posed harbors. The National Guard. I approve the suggestion of the secretary of war, that provisions be made for encamping companies of the national guard in our coast works for a specified time each year, and for their training in the use of heavy guns. His suggestion that an increase of tin* artillery force of the army is desirable as is also in connection, commended to the consideration of congress. Public? Improvements. The improvement of our important rivers and harbors should he promoted by the necessary appropriations. Care should Im* taken that the government is not committed to the prosecution of works not of public aud general advantage, and that tiie relative usefulness of works of that class is not overlooked. So far as this work can ever he said to Ik* completed, I do not doubt that t he end would be sooner ami more economically reached, if fewer separate works wen under taken at the same time, and those selected for their greater general interest were more rapidly pushed to completion. Work once considerably begun should not he subjected to the risk and de terioration which interrupted or insufficient ap propriations necessarily occasion. Protection of Federal Officers. The assault made by David S. Terry upon the person of Justice Field of tie* supreme court of the United States at Lathrop. California, in Au gust last , and the killing or the assailant by a deputy United Slates marshal, who had been de puted to accompany Justice Field and to protect nim from anticipated violence at the hands of Terry, in connection with the legal proceedings which have followed, suggest questions which, in my judgn eu f > are worthy tlu* attention of con gress. T recommend that more definite provision la* made by law. not only for tiie protection of federal officers, but for a full trial for such cases in the United States courts. In recom mending such legislation 1 do not at ail impeach either tin* general adequacy of the provision made by the state laws for I he protection of all citizens or the general disposition of those charged with the execution of such laws to give protection to the officers of the United States. The duty of protecting its officers as such, ami of punishing those who assault them on account of their official acts should not he devolved express ly or by acquiescence upon tlu? local authorities. Protection of Witnesses. Events which have been brought to my atten* tion happening in other parts of the country, have also suggested the propriety of extending by legislation fuller protection to those who may he called as vn finesses in the courts of the United States. The law compels those who are supposed to have knowledge of public offenses to attend upon our courts and grand juries and to give evi dence. Then* is a manifest resulting duty that these witnesses shall he protected from injury on account of their testimony. The investigations of criminal offenses are often rendered futile and the punishment of crime impossible, by the in timidation of witnesses. Needs of the .supreme Court. The necessity of providing some more speedy method for disposing of eases which now come 1< r final judication to the supreme court becomes eve y year more apparent and urgent. The plan of providing some intermediate courts having final appellate jurisdiction of certain classes of questions and cases, has, 1 think, received a more general approval from the bench and bar of tin* country than any other. Without attempting to discuss details 1 recommend that provision should lie made for the establishment of such courts. How the Surplus Can be Reduced. The salaries of judges of the district courts in many of the districts are, in my judgment, inad equate. 1 recommend that all such salaries now Ih*low *2), (XX) per annum he increased to that amount. It is quite true that the amount of labor performed by these judges is very unequal, but as they cannot properly engage in other pursuits Ih* such, in all cases, as to provide an independent and comfortable support. Not Private Affairs Earnest attention should Im* given by congress to a consideration of the question how far the restraint of those combinations of capital com monly called “trusts,” is a matter of federal jurisdiction. When organized, as they often are, to crush out all healthy comjietilion and to mon opolize the production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity, i hey are dan gerous conspiracies against the public good, and should be made the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation. The subject of an international copyright has been frequently commended to the attention of congress h\ my predecessors. The enactment of such a law wouln be eminently wise and just. Naturalization and Raukrnpt Laws fT Our naturalization laws should he so revised as to make the inquiry into the character and good disposition towards our government of the j**r sons applying for citizenship more thorough. This can only m* done by taking fuller eontrol of the examinations, by tixinc times for hearing such applications and by reqairing the presence of someone who shall represent the government in the inquiry Those who are the enemies of svK*ial order ho come to our shores to swell tne injurious influence and to extend the evil prac tices of any association that defies our laws, should not only be denied citizenship but domicile.

THE DEPARTMENTS. Operations In tlu* Postal llronch of the Government During the Year. The report of the postmaster-general not only exhibits the operations of the department for the fiscal year, but contains many valuable sugges tions for the improvement and extension ot tbe service, which an* commended to your attention. V *>ther branch of the government basso closely a contact with the daily life of the people. Almost every one uses the service it off** s. and every hour gained in the transmission of the great com meivial mails, has an actual ami possible value that only those engaged in trade can understand. The living of one day in the transmission of the mails between New York ami San Francisco, which has leoently been accomplished, is an inci dent worthy of mention. The plan suggested of a supervision of tlu* post office on sej*arate dis trict* that shall involve instruction and suggestion and a rating of efficiency of the po 4masters, would, I have no doubt, greatly improve the service. A pressing necessity exists for the erection of a budding for the joint use of tiie department and of the city poet office. The dedfcrtmtnt was par tially relieved by renting outside quarters fr a part’ of its force but it is again over-crowded. The building used bv the city office never was fit for the puq*ose and i< now inadequate and un wholesome. The unsatisfactory condition of law relating to ilu* transmission through the mails of lottery advertisements and remittances is clearly stated by the postmaster^-general and lus sugges ti n as to amendments should have your favor able consideration. Condition of Our Nary Tbe report of the secretary of tin* nary shows a reorganization of the bureaus of the depart ment that will. 1 do not doubt, promote the ef ficiency of each. In general, satisfactory progress .* ’ • made iu i . •'.*!rue*t *n •>? i.* sim-cf var authorized oy v*ngress. Tiie first vessel "f tiie new navy, the I* iphm. was subjected to a very severe trial test and to very much ad verse criticism. But it is gratifying to be able to e that a cruise around the v * -rid from which she has recently returned, has demonstrated that >he ls a firs! -class vessel < f tier rate. The report of the secretary shows tiiat while the effective fo x*e >*f tne uaw is rapidly increasing by reason of the improved build and arnumient of the new ships, t iit* number of our*hius fit for <•-% duty grow- very slowly. We had on tne 4th of March L*<l thirty seven serviceable slm —and though four bate since been added to the H*: the t.*tal has not been in creased, because in tin* mean time four have been K*st >r condemned. Tw> nty-six additional vessels liave been authorized and appropriated for. but it ls probable that when they are' completed, our list will only be increased to forty-two. a gain f five. The old wooden ships are disappearing al most as last as the new vessels age added. These facts.-arry their own argument. One of the new ships may. in fighting strength, equal two of the old. but it cannot do the cruising duties of two. It is important, therefore, that we should have a a more rapid increase in the number of servicea ble ships. I concur in the recommendation of the secretary, that the construction of eight ar mored ships, three gunboats and five torpedo boats be authorized. An appalling calamity befell three of our naval vessels on duty at the Samoan Isles in the harbor of Apia, in March last, involving the loss of tour officers and forty-seven seamen, of rw.j vessels, the Trenton and Vandal ia, and the disabling of a third, the Nipt' The vessels of the German navy also in the harbor shared with our ships the force of the hurricane, and suffered even more heavily. While mourning the brave officers and men, who died facing with High resolve, perils greater than those of battle, it is most grat ifying to state the credit of the American navy for seamanship, courage and generosity was mag nificently sustained in the storm-beaten harbor of Apia. The Interior Department. The report of the secreiary of the interior ex hibits the transactions of the government with the Indian tribes. Substantial progress has been made in the education of the children of school age and the allotment of lands to adult Indians. It is to be regretted that the policy of breaking up the tribal regulation and of dealing with the In dian as an individual, did not appear earlier in our legislation. Large reservations held in com mon and the maintenance of the authority of the chiefs and head men, have deprived the individual of every incentive to the exercise of theft, and the annuity has contributed an affirmative im pulse toward a state of confirmed pauperism. Our treaty stipulations should Im* observed with fidelity, and our legislation should he highly con siderate of the l>est interests of an ignorant and helpless people. The reservations are now gen erally surrounded by white settlements. We can no longer push the Indian hack into the wilder ness, and it remains only, by every suitable agency, to push him upward into the state of a self-supporting and responsible citizen. For the adult, the first step is to locate him upon a farm, and for the child, to place him in a school. And school attendance should be promoted by every moral agency, and those fail ing should be compelled. The national schools for Indians have been very successful, and should be multiplied, and as far as possible should be so organized and conducted as to facil ia te the transfer of the schools to tne slates or territories in which they are located when the Indians in the neighborhood have accepted citi zenship and have become otherwise fitted for such a transfer. This condition of things will be attained slowly, but it will be hastened by keeping it in mind. And in the meantime that co-operation between the goverment and tin* mission schools which has wrought much good, should be cordially and im partially sustained. The last two distinct laws relating to negotiations with the Sioux Indians of Dakota, for a relinquishment of a portion of their land to the United States, and for dividing the remainder into separate reserva tions; both were approved on the same day, March 2. The one submitted to the Indiansa specific proposition, the other i section ‘1 of the Indian appropriation act) authorized by the pres ident to appoint three commissioners to negotiate with these Indians for the accomplishment of the same general purj)ose. and required that any agreements made should be submitted to con gress for ratification. On the 16tb day of April last. I appointed Hon. Charles Foster, *f Ohio. Hon. William Wayne, of Missouri, and Major General George Crook, of th* United States army, commissioners under the last named law. They were, however, authorized and directed first to submit to the Indians the definite proposition made to them by the act fii*st mentioned, and only in the event of a failure to secure the assent of the requisite number to that proposition, to open negotiations for modified terms under the oth t act. The work of the com mission was prolonged ami arduous, but the a>- sent of the requisite number was. it is understood, finally obtained to the proposition made by congress, although the report of the commission has not yet been submitted. In view of these facts 1 shall not. as at present advised, deem it necessary to submit the agreement to congress l or ratification, but it will in due course, Im* submitted for information. This agreement releases to the United States about 9,000.000 acres of land. The commission provided for by section 11 of tiie Indian appropriation bill, to negotiate with the Cherokee Indians and all other Indian owning or claiming lands lying west of ths ninety-sixth degree of longitude for the ces sion to the United States of all such lands was constituted by the appointment of Hon. Lucius Fairchild, of Wisconsin, Hon Jno. F. Hartranft, of Pennsylvania, and Hon. Alfred M Wilson of Arkansas, and organized on June 29th last. Their first conference with the representa tives of the Cherokees was held at Talilequah, July 29th. with no definite results. Gen. John F. Hartranft, of Pennsylvania, was prevented by ill health from taking part in the conference. His death, which occurred recently, is justly and generally lamented by a people he has served with conspicuous gallantry in war and with great fidelity in peace. The vacancy thus created was tilled by the appointment of Hon. Warren G. Sayre, of Indiana. A second conference between the commission and the Cherokees was begun November 6th, but no results have yet been obtained, nor is it be lieved that a conclusion can be immediately ex jH*cted. The cattle syndicate now occupying the lauds for grazing purposes is clearly one of the agencies responsible tor the obstruction of our •negotiations with the Cherokees. The large body of agricultural land, constituting what is known as the ** Cherokee outlet, 1 ' ought not to be and cannot long be held fur grazing and for the ad vantage of a few against tin* public interests and the best advantage of the Indians themselves. The United States has now under the treaties certain rights in these lands. These will not be used oppressively, but it cannot be al lowed that those who by si;iterance occupy these lands shall interpose to defeat the wise and ben eficial purposes of the government. I cannot but believe that the advantageous character of t lie otter made by the United States to the Cherokee nation for a full release of these himLs as com pared with other suggestions now made to them will yet obtain for it favorable consideration. Under the agreement made between the United States ami the Muscogee (or Creek) Nation of Indians on the 19th day of January, 1889, an abso lute title was secured bv the United States to about three and a half millions of acres of land. Section 12 of the general Indian appropriation act, approved March 2, 1889, made provision for lie- purchase by the United States from the Sem inole tribe of a certain portion of their lands. The delegates of the Seminole Nation having first duly evidenced to me their power to act in that behalf, delivered a proper release and conveyance to the United States of all the la i mentioned in the act, which was accepted by me, and certified to be in compliance with the statute. By the terms of both the acts referred to, all the lands so purchased were declared to Im* a part of the public domain and open I • > settlement, under the homestead law. But of the land em braced in these purchases, being in the agreement about 5.500,0*** acres. 3.500,000 acres had already, under the terms of the treaty of been ac quired by tlu* United States for the purpose of settling other Indian tribes thereon, and had been appropriated to that purpose. The land remain ing and available for settlement consisted of !,SS7,7*.m> acres, surrounded on all sides by lands in the occupancy of Indian tribes. Congress had provided no civil government for the people who were to be invited by my proclamation and to settle upon these lands, except as the new court which had been established at Muscogee, or the United States court in some of the adjoining states, had power to enforce the general laws of the United States. In this condition of things I was quite reluctant to open the lands to settle ments. But in view of the fact that the several thousand jiersons, mam of them with their fami lies, had gathered upon ilie borders of the Indian Territory, with a view of securing home steads on the ceded lands, and that de lay would involve them in much loss, and suffering, I did on the 23rd day of March last issue a proclamation declaring that the lands therein desired would be open to settlement under the provisions of the law, on the 22nd day of April following, at 12 o'clock noon. Two land districts had been established, and the offices were open for the transaction of business when the appointed time arrived. It is much to the credit of the settlers that they very generally ob served the limitation as to the time when they might enter the territory. Care will be taken that those who entered in violation of the law do not secure the advantage they un fairly sought. There was a good deal oi appre hension that tin* strife for locutions woul 1 result in much violence and bloodshed, but hapoily these anticipations were not realized. It is estimated tiiat there are now in the territory about 

(KMHN) people, and several considerable* towns have sprung up, for which temporary municipal governments have already been organized. Guthrie is said to now have a population of almost 8j)00. Eleven schools and nine churches have been established. Three daily and five weekly newspapers are published in this city, whose charter and ordinances have only the sanction of the voluntary acquiescence of the people from day to day. Oklahoma City has a Imputation of 5.000 and Ls proportionately well provided as Guthrie with churches, schools and newspapers. Other towns and villages hav ing populations cf from one hundred to a thousand are scattered over the territory. In order to secure the peace of this new commu nity in the absence of civil government, I directed General Merritt, commanding the department of the Missouri, to act in conjunction with the mar shals of the United States to preserve the peace, and upon their requisition to use the troojis to aid them in executing warrants and in quieting riots orbreachesof the peace that might arise. He was further directed to use his intiuenee to promote good order and to avoid any conflicts between or with the settlers. Believing that the introduction and sale of liquors where no legal restraint or regulations existed would endanger the public peace, and in view of the fact that such liquors must first <** introduced into the Indian reserva tions before reaching the white settlements. I further dir vted the general commanding to en force the laws relating t*the introduction of ar dent spirits into the Indian country. The pres ence oi the troops has given a sense of security to the w. 11-disposed citizens, and has tended !> restrain the lawless. In one instance the officer in immendiate command of the troops went fur ther than I deemed justifiable in supporting th * tie facto municipal government of Outline, and he was so informed and directed to limit the interference of the military to the support of the marshals on th< lines indicated iu the orig inal order. I very urgently recommend that con gress at once provide a territorial government tor these people. Serious questions which may at any time lead to violent outbreaks are await ing the institution of courts for their peaceful adjustment. The American genius for self-gov ernment ha> been well illustrated in Oklahoma, but it is neither safe nor wise i • !**•.. - e these peo ple longer to the expedients which hav tem porarily served them. Provision should be made for acquisition of the titles to town lots in towns now established in Alaska for locating town sites and th*-* estab lishment of municipal government s. Only the min ing laws have been extended to tiiat territory, and no other form of title t<> lands can now le obtained. The general land laws were framed with reference to the disposa ion of agricultural lands, and it i< doubtful if their operation in Alaska would be beneficial. Applicable to Alaska. We have fortunately not extended to Alaska the mistaken policy of establishing reservati us for the Indian tribes, and can deal with them from the beginning as individuals with. I an. sure, bet - lands and any regulations relating to timler, and to the fisheries. should ha* * a fc.udiy re gard to their interests. Having no power to levy tax**s. the people Alaska are wholly dependent on the general governi-ient t > whose revenues the seal fi>heries make a large annual contribution.

Perhaps the organi zation of several si ib-dist riots with a small munic ipal council, of limited powers for each, would be safe and useful. Attention is called in this connection to '■sugges tions of the secretary’ of the treasury, relating to the establishment oi another port of entry in Alaska, and of other needed custom facilities and regulations. Fabric Limb In the artminimi ation of the land laws the pol icy of facilitating in every proper way. the ad justment of the honest claims of individual set tlers upon the public lands, has been pursued. Tlic number of pending ca> had during tfe- pre ceding adm: nisi ration have leen gr-ally in creased under ihe operation of ardors fur a time suspending final action in a large l<art of the cases originating in the west and northwest, and by the subsequent use of un usual methods of examm ation only those who are familiar with the condition* under which our agricultural lands have been settled can ap preciate the serious and often fatal consequences to the settlers of a policy that x>uts his title under suspicion, or delays the issuances of his patent. W bile cane is taken to prevent and to expose fraud, it should not be imputed without reason The manifest purpose of the homestead and pre emption laws was to promote the settlement of the public domain by persons having a bona tide it :* nt to make a home upon the selected lands. Where this intent is well established and the re quirements of the law Lave been substantially **' unplied with. th* claimant is entitled to a prompt and friendly consideration of his case. But where there is reason to believe that the claimant is the mere agent of another who is seeking to evade a Law intended to promote small holdings and to secure by fraudulent methods large tracts of limber and other lands, both principal and agents, should not only in* thwarted in their fraudulent purpose, but should be made to feel tr-“ full penalties of our criminal statutes. The laws should be so administered as not to *on found these two classes and to visit penalties only upon the latter. The uusetUed state of lb** titles to large bodies of lands in the terri t ries of New Mexico and Arizonia has greatly retarded the development of those territories. Provision should be made by law for the prompt trial and final adjustment be fore a judicial tribunal or commission of all claims, based upon Mexican grants, it is not just to an intelligent and enterprising people that their peso * should be disturbed and their prop erty retarded by these old contentions. 1 express the hope that differences of opinion as to meth ods may yield to the urgency ot the case. Pensions. The law provides a pension for every soldier and sailor who was mustered into service of the United States during the civil war. and is now suf fering from wounds or disease, having an origin in the service aud the time of duty, two of three necessary faces, viz., muster and disability are usually susceptible of easy proof; but the third origin in the service is often difficult, and in maii3* deserving cases imjiossihie to establish. Tiiat very many of those who endured the hardship of our most bloody and arduous campaigns, are now disabled from disease that had a real, not traceable origin in service we do not doubt: besides those are another class composed of men many of whom served an enlistment of three full years, and of re-enlisted veterans, who added a fourth year of service, who escaped the casualties of battles and the assaults of disease, who were always ready for any detail, who were in every battle line of their command, and were mustered out in sound health, aud have, since the close of the war, while lighting with the same indomnible and in dependent spirit the contests of civil life, been overcome by disease or casualty. I am not unaware that the pension roll already involves a very large annual expenditure: neither am I deterred by that fact from recommending that congress grant a pension to such honorably discharged soldiers and sailors of the civil war as. having rendered substantial service during the war, are now dependent upon their own labor for a maintenance, aud by dLsea.se or casualty are in capacitated from earning it. Many of the men who would be included in this form of relief are now dependent upon public aid. and it does not. in my judgment, consist with the national honor that they shall continue to subsist upon the local relief given in discriminately to paupers, instead of upon the special aud generous provision of the nation they served so gallantly ana unselfishly. Our people will. I am sure, very generally approve such legislation, and 1 am equally sure that the survivors of the Union army and navy will feel a grateful sense of relief when this Worthy aud suffering class of their comrades are as fairly pro vided for. There are some manifest inequalities in the existing law that should be remedied. To some of these* the secretary of the interior has called attention. It is gratifying to be able to state that the adop tion of new and better methods in the war depart ment, the calls of the jM*nsiou office for informa tion os to the military and hospital records of pension claimants are now promptly answered, and the Injurious and vexatious delays that have heretofore occurred are entiriely avoided. This will greatly facilitate the adjustment of all pend ing claims. The New States. The advent of four new states, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana and Washington, into the Union imder the constitution in the same month, and the admission of their duly chosen represent atives to our national congress at the same ses sion, is an event as exampled as it is interesting. The certification of the votes cast and of the con stitutions adopted in each of the states was filed with me as required by the eighth section of the act of February 22. 1889, by the governors of said territories respectively. Having, after a care ful examination, found tiiat the several con stitutions and governments were republican in form and not repugnant to the constitution of the United States, that all the provisions of the act of congress bad been complied with, and that a majority of votes cast in each of said pro posed states was in favor of adopting constitu tions submitted therein. I did so declare by a separate proclamation as to each: as to North Dakota and South Dakota, on Saturday, Novem ber 22; as to Montana, on Friday, Novembers, and as to Washington, on Monday. November 11. Each of these siates has within it resources, the development of winch will employ the energies of, anu yield a comfortable subsistence to a great population. The smallest of these new states, Washington, stands twelfth, and the largest. Montana, third among the forty-two in area. The people of these states are already well trained, intelligent and patriotic American citizens, hav ing common interests and sympathies with those of the ojder states, and a common purpose to de fend the integrity of. and uphold the honor of the nation. An Appeal for Railroad Men. The attention of the inter-state commerce com mission has been called to the urgent need of congressional legislation for the better protection of the lives and limbs of those engaged iu oper ating the great inter-state freight lines of the country, and especially of the yardmen and brakemen. A petitition signed by nearly ten thousand railway brakemen waa presented to the commission, asking that steps might Im* taken to bring about the use of automatic brakes aud couplers on freight cars. At a meeting of the state railroad commission ers and their accredited representatives, held at Washington, in March last, upon the invitation of the inter-state commerce commission, a resolu tion was unanimously adopted, urging the com mission to consider what can be done to prevent the loss of life and limb in coupling and uncoup ling freight cars and in handling tlu* brakes of such cars. During the year ending June 20, 1888, over 2.000 railroad employes were killed in service, and more than 20,000 injured. It is competent, 1 think, for congress to require uniformity in the construction of cars used in inter-state commerce, anil the use of im proved safety appliances upon such trains. Time will be necessary to make the needed changes, hut an earnest and intelligent beginning should he made at once. It is a reproach to our civiliza tion that any class of American workmen should in the piysuit of a necessary and useful vocation be subjected to a peril of life and limb as great as that of a soldier in time of war. Agricultural Department. The creat ion of an executive department, to be known as the department of agriculture, by the act of February 9 last, was a wise and timely re sponse to a request which had long been respect fully urged by the farmers of the country, but much remains to be done to perfect the organiza tion of the department so that it fairly realizes the expectations which its creation excited. In this connection attention is called to suggestions contained in the report of the secretary, which is herewith submitted. The need of a law officer for Ilie department, such as is provided for the other executive departments, is manifest. The failure of tin* last congress to make the usual provision for the publication of the annual report should be promptly remedied. The public interest in Hie report and its value to the farming community I am sure, will not bo diminished under the new organization of the department. Weather Service Reorganization. 1 recommend that the weather service Im* separ ated from the war department, and established as p bureau in the department of agriculture. This will involve an entire reorganization both of the weather bureau and of the signal corps, making of Hi* first a purely civil organization, and of Hie other a purely military staff corps. Tne report of the chief signal officer shows that the work of the corps on its military side, has been deteriorating. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. Recommending the Regulation of the Sale ot Intoxicating Drinks. The interests of the people of the District of Columbia should not Im* lust sight of in the pres sure for consideration of measures affecting the whole country. Having no legislation of its own, either municipal or general, its people must look to congress for the regulation of those concerns that are the subject of local control. Our whole people have an interest that the national capital should be made attractiveand b autifid. and above all that its repute for social order should be main tained, the laws regulating the sale of intoxicat ing drink* in the Dis rirt should be* revised with a view to bringing the traffic under stringent limi tations and control In execution of the power conferred upon me by the act making appropriations for the excuses of the district of Columbia, lor the year ending June 3u, 1889. I did, on the 17th day of August last, ap point Rudolph dering. of Sew York, Samuel M. Gray, of Rhode Island, and Frederick P. Srearas.of Massachusetts, three eminent sanitary engineers, to examine and report upon the system of sewer age existing in the district of Columbia. Their report which i* not yet completed will be in due course submitted to congress. The report of the commissioners of the district is herewith trans mitted and the attention of congress is called to the suggestions contained therein. World's Fair. The proposition to observe the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by the opening of a world’* fair, or exposition in some one of Our great cities will be y.esented for the consideration of congress. The value and interest of >u r\ n exposition may well claim the promo tion t the government. THE CIVIL SERVICE. Public Confidence Somewhat Shaken as to the Impartiality of Appointments. On the 4ih of March lart, the civil service com mis-;.g had but a tingie member. The vaeau cies w.-re tilled on ' the 7th day of May, and since then the commissioners have been in dustriously, though with an inadequate force, en gaged ir. executing the law. They were assured by me that cordial support would he given them in the faiThiui and impartial enforcement of the statute and of th** rules and regulations adopted m aid of it. Heretofore the book of eligible* ha be**n clo> *d to every one except as certifications were made upon the requisition of lh** appointing officers, fins secrecy was the source of much >ue picion and of many charges of favoritism iu the administration of th- law. What i* ;-eeret is ai- I ways <u*pecied, and what is open can be judged, i Lit* bers. lia- now o:**n<* the list of eligible* to I he public. The eligible lisi* for classified p*~Toffi<-es and custom bou=e> are now publicly polled in the respective >fin a* ar* also ihe certifica tions for appointment*. The purpose of civil service law was absolutely to exclude .mother consideration in connection with appointments under it, than That of merit, as tested : y The ex amination. The business proceeds upon the theory both the examining boards and the appoi a:- mg fficers .tre absolutely ignorant as to the polh iea i .ew* and assoclattocs of all persons oi; the c vii service list*.

The reform of the civil service will make no sate i;r satisfactory advance until the present law aiii its e s ial admiai*Traiin are well established in the confidence of tb** people. It will be my pleasure, a* it - my duty* u> *ee that the ia ex ecuted with finaue*- and impartiality. If some of It* v rovj*ons have b**en fraudulently evaded by appointing fficers. oar resentment should noi suggest the repeal of the law, but reform in its adminisTru'inu. We should have uw* view of the matter, and h<.’d it with a sincerity that hf tea af fected by the con*i.leraiioa that th-* party to which we belong is for the time in power. M*. ureuee—or, on the 4th day of J senary bv j a executive order to lake effect March 15 brought th** railway mail service under the opera tion of the civil service . Provi-v-m ma*!*- - nn~ the order *bouW take effect sooner m anv j-jite where an eligible list wa* -ooner obtained. On the llm day of March. Mr Lyman, then the only member of the con&iadMi reported u> me in writing, that ii would not be possible to have the list ready before May Ist, and requested that the taking effect of the order be postponed until that time, which vras done, subject to The same provision contained in the original order, as to the stales in which an eligible! \t was sooner obtained. a result of the revision of the rules of the ue classification and of the inclusion of the railway mtil service the work of the commission has been V increased and the present cleri cal force is found to be inadequate. I recommend that the additional clerks asked for by the commis sion be appropriated for. The duty of appoint ment is devolved by the constitution or by the law, and the appointing officers are proper!v held to a high responsibility in its exercise, the growth of the country and the consequent increase of the civil list have magnified this function of the executive dispropomonaily. It cannot be denied, however, that the labor connected with this neces sary work is increased often to the point of actual distress by the sudden and excessive demands that are made upon an incoming administration for removals and appointments; but on the other hand it is not true that incumbency is a conclusive argument for a continuance in office. Impartiality, moderation, fidelity to pub lic duty and a good atlainmei t iu the discharge of It must be added before the argument is complete. hen those holding administrative offices so con duct themselves as to convince just political op ponents that no party consideration or bias affects in any way the discharge of their public duties, we can more easily stay the demands tor removals. 1 am satisfied that both in and out of classified service, great benefits would accrue from the adoption of some system, by which the officers would receive the distinction* and benefit that in all private employments comes from exceptional faithfulness and efficiency in the performance of duty. I have suggested to the heads of the exec utive departments, that they consider whether a record might not be kept in each bureau, of all those elements that are covered by the terms, “faithfulness" and “efficiency.” and a* rating made showing the relative merits ot the clerks of each class, this rating to be regarded as a test of merit in making promotions. I have also suggested to the postmaster-general that he adopt some plan by which he can, upon the basis of the reports to the department ana of frequent inspections, indicate the relative merit of the postmasters of each class. They will be ap propriately indicated in the official register ami re port of the department. Thai a great stimulus would thus be given to the whole service, I do nut doubt, and such a record would be the best defense against removals from office. 

MISCELLANEOUS. A Liberal and Progressive Policy Favored —National Aid to Education. The interest of the general government in the education of the people found an early expression not only in the thoughtful and sometimes warning utterances of our ablest statesmen, but in liberal appropriations trom the common resources for the support ot ednea lon in th* new states. No ons will deny that it is of the gravest national concern that those who hold the Ultimate control of all public affairs shorn! have the necessary intelli gence wisely to direct and determine them. Na tional aid to education has heretofore taken the form of land grants and that form the con stitutional power ot congress to promote the edu cation of people is not seriouslv questioned. 1 do not think it can be successfully questioned when the form is changed to that of a direct grant of money from the public treasury Such aid should be as it always has been, suggested by some ex ceptional conditions. The sudden emancipation of the slaves, the bestowal of the suffrage which soon folk* wed, and the impairment of the ability of the states where these new citizens were chiefly found, to be adequately provided with educational facilities, presented not only an exceptional, but unexampled condition. That the situation has l>eeu much ameliorated, there is no doubt. The ability and interest of the states have happily increased, but a great work re mains to be done, and I think the general govern ment should lend its aid. As the suggestion of a national grant in aid of education grows chiefly out of conditions and needs of the emancipated slave and his descendants, the relief should, as far as possible, while necessarily proc iing upon some general lines, be applied to the need that suggested it. It is essential, if much good is to le accomplished, that the sympathy aud active interest of the people of tlie states should be enlisted, and that tne methods adopted should be such as to stimulate and not to supplant local taxation for school purposes. As one con gress cannot bind a succeeding one in such a case, and as the efforts must in some degree be experi mental, 1 recommend that any appropriation for this purpose be so limited in annual amount and as to the time over which it is to extend, as will on the one hand give the local school authorities opportunity to make the Im*sl use of the first year’s allowance, and on the other deliver from the temptation to unduly postpone the assumption of tne whole burden themselves. A Plea for the Colored Man. The colored people did not intrude themselves upon us; they were brought here, in chains and held in the communities where they are now chiefly found by a cruel slave code. Happily for both faces, they are now free. They have, from a standpoint of ignorance and poverty, w hich was our shame, not theii>, made remarkable advances in education and in the acquisition of properly. They have, as a people, shown themselves to la* friendly and faithful toward the white r.sce under temptations of tremendous strength. They have their representatives in the national cemeteries, where a grateful government has gathered the ashes of those Who died in its defense. They have furnished to our regular army regiments that have won high praise for their commanding officers for courage and soldierly qualities, and for fidelity to the en listment oath. In civil life they are the toilers of their comm unities, making their full contributions to the widening streams of prosperity which the communities are receiving. Their sudden with drawal would stop production and bring disorder in the household. Generally, they do not desire to quit their homes, tnd their employers resent the interference of the emigration agents who seek to stimulate such a desire; but notwithstanding all this, in many parts of our country where the colored population is large, the people of that race are by various devices de prived of any effective exercise of their political rights, and of many of their civil rights. Tne wrong does not expend it self upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged. It has been the hope of every patriot that a sense of justice and of respect for the law would work a gradual cure of these flagrant evils. Surely no one supposes that the present can be accepted us a permanent condition. If it is said that these communities must work out ot this problem for themselves we have a right to ask whether they are at work upon it. Do they suggest any solution? When and under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact, to have those full civil rights, which have so long been his in law. When is that equality of influence which our form of gov ernment was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? This generation should courageously face these grave questions and not leave them as a heritage of woe to the next. The consultation should proceed with candor, calmness and great patience, upon the lino or justice and humanity, not of prejudice and cruel ty. No question in our country can he at rest ex cept upon the firm base of justice and of the law. I earnestly invoke the attention of congress to the considerat ion of such measures within its well de fined constitutional power, as will secure to all our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other civil right under *he constitutions and law s of the United states. cio evil, however deplorable, can justify the assumption, either on the part of the executive or of congress, of pow ers not granted, but both will Im* highly blamable if all the powers granted are not w isely but firmly used to correct these evils. Federal Control of Elections Sanctioned. The power to the whole direction and control of the election of members of the house of represent atives is clearly given to the general government. A partial and qualified supervision of these elec tions is now provided for by law. and in ray opin ion, this law may In? so strengthened and extended as to secure on the whole better results than can 1m? attained by a law taking all the processes of such election into federal control. The colored man should be protected in all of his relations to the federal government, whether as litigant, juror or witness in our courts, as an elector ot members of congress, or as a peaceful traveler on our inter state railways. .Subsidies Should be Granted. There is nothing more justly humiliating to the national pride ana nothing more harmful to the national prosperity than the inferiority of our merchant marine compared with that of other nations whose general resources of wealth aud sea coast lines do not suggest any reason for their supremacy on the sea. It was not always so, and our people are agreed, I think, that it shall not continue to be so. it is not possible in this com munication to discuss the causes of the decay of our shipping interests or the differing methods by which it i* proposed to restore them. The statement of a few well authenticated facts and some general suggesiions as to legisla tion is all that is practicable that the great steam ship lines sailing under the flags of England, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, and engaged in foreign commerce were promoted and have since been, and now are lib erally aided by grants of public money, in one form or another, is generally known. Thai the American lines of steamships have Imhmi abandon ed bv us to an unequal contest with the aided lines of other nations until they have been withdrawn or in ihe few case.- where they are still maintained are subject to serious disadvantages is a matter of common knowledge. The present situation is such that travelers and merchandise find Liverpool often a necessary intermediate port l>etween New York and some of the Boath American capitals. The fact that some of the delegates from South Amer ican states to the conference of American nations now in session at Washington reached our shores by reversing that line of travel is very conclusive of the need of such a conference and very suggest ive a- to the fir-t and mort necessary step iu the di rection of fuller and more benefioal intercourse w ith nations that are now our neighlsirs. not only upon the lines of latitude, but upon the lines of established commercial intercourse. Our Ocean Mail Service Should be Aided. I recommend that such appropriation* be made for ocean mail service in American steamships between our ports and those of Central and South America. China, Japan and the important islands in both of the great oceans as will Is* liberallv re munerative for the service rendered, as will en courage the establishment and in -ome fair degree equalize the chances of American steamship lines in the competition which they must meet. That ibe American -lares lying south of us will cor diallv co-operate in establishing and maintaining -tich line- of steamships to tneir principal ports I do not doubt. A Naval Reserve Should be Provided. We should ai-> make provision for a naval re serve, to consist of snch merchant ships of meri can construction and of a specified tonnage and speed, as the owner- will consent to place at the use of the government in case of need, as armed ernisei-. England ha* adopted this poiio. and a* a result, can now upon necessity at once place upon her navai ii*t. -ome of the fastest steam -hip- in tr.** world.

Deafness Can't be Cured by local application, as they can not reach the diseased portion of the ear. There is only one way to cure Deafness and Dial is by constitutional remedies. Deafness is caused by an infiamed condition of tlie mucus lining of the Eustachian Tube. Wheu this tube gets inflamed you have a rumbling sound or imperfect hearing, and when it is entirely closed Deafness is the re sult, and unless the inflammation can be taken out and this tube restored to its nor mal condition, hearing will be destroyed for ever; nine cases out of ten are caused by ca tarrh, which is nothing but an inflamed con dition of the mucus surfaces. We will give One Hundred Dollars for any case of Deafness (caused by Catarrh) that we can not cure by taking Hall's Catarrh Cure. Send for circulars, free. F. J.
