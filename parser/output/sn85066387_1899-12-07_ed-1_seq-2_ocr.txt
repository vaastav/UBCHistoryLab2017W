INTEREST TO PEOPLE OF THE PACIFIC COAST Treasury Department Officials Accept the Stevens Site for the Oak land Building. WASHINGTON. Dec 6.— Continual de lay In the selection of the site for the Oakland public building caused Senator Perkins and Representative Metcalf to call upon the Treasury ■'•::••:.■ offi cials to-day and urge them to reach an agreement at once. The treasury officials after a consultation decided on the Stev ens site. They liked the Bacon property, but decided against II on the ground that it was not on ■ business thoroughfare. "I am glad the matter is determined without further delay," said Representa tive Metcalf to-night, "and propose to do all I possibly can to have the department ativc-rtis* for bids at once." Suiator Perkins and Representative Metcalf will insist that the best possible material be used in the construction of this building and that Oakland men will get the contracts is hoped by both. Representative Kahn to-day called on the Supervising Architect of the Treas ury relative to the sewer connection be tween Odd Fellows' Hall and the new city PostolHce in San Francisco. He says the Treasury Department officials are very friendly toward the proposition asked, that the sewer now running through Sev enth street be allowed to empty into the Government main. All that the directors of the Odd Fellows 1 Hall will have to do Is to make formal application to the Tr.-a.sury Department. This will save a great expense to the Odd Fellows of San Francisco.

ANGLOMANIA LEADS TO CHURCH STRIFE Sausalito Congregation Engaged in a Genuine Terr)pest in a Teapot Warfare. SAt'SAMTO. Doc. 6.— The members of Christ Episcopal dwell, which has enrolled among Its communicants a goodly number of persons belonp inc to the ultra-fashionable set, lave evidently forgotten the admonition of th.-ir divine leader to found their faith upon the rock of peace and are en •(1 n the throes of civil war— a genuine tempest-in-a-toapot upheaval— which threatens to necessitate tnc services of Bishop Nichols as arbitrator. Anglomania Is the cause of the strife, so a majority of the members declare nnd such Is the antipathy felt by them toward what they roeard as a mild foim of snobbery that they hr.ye "done politics" in the effort to defeat the alleged Anglomaniacs. This wire-pulling m successful— only too successful for the sake of har mony—nnd the fashionable set have aired tholr grievances by a proclamation that they intend to draw the afToir to the attention of Bishop Nichols on ac cour.t of political methods which 'hey think would have done honor to the late Bora Buckley. It is the old story of the "hill tribe" arrayed against the "water front" In a new form. Instead of politics and poolrooms this time It Is a religion difficulty In which politics has already played an Important* factor. The eW-ment, represented by Town Trustee Crumpton. Constable John X Creed. K. D. Sparrow and others, assort that the aristocratic contingent desired an English choir, an English organist and last, but not least, an English paster. The question of a pastor proved tho bete noire of their dif ferences. Rev. William Hamilton, the present pastor, was good enough for tho "pl»»bs " and they worked hard to retain l:im. At the annual election held last evening at the church rival tickets for new directors were placed in the field. The "hill tribe" had an entire new llHt of proposed directors, and their opponents the same old "solid nine." The "water front" division "won out" by a fair majority. Mrs Sperry, wife of the flmir magnate, then set up the claim that the list of eligible voters had been swelled by the addition of a number of children— that the "p!«bs" had stuffed the great regiptor of the churrh. Pastor Hamilton stated that only three children had voted and that their votes would be withdrawn. Mrs. Sperry was still dissatisfied and announced her Intention of asking Bishop Nichols to take due copnizance of the situation. As mutter.-; now stand the ol<* board Is declared regularly elected and -will see to it tl Hamilton \h>- old choir and the present organist are retained. It Is asserted by nna at the members that the reason for the at tempt to accomplish a eh ing* of pastors Is due to the fact that the eldest daughter of John E. Shoobert of the Shoobert-Beale Company is soon to marry a young English minister, and the desire of the ultra-fashionables was to see him installed as the head of the church.

FILIPINOS ARE FAR FROM BEING CONQUERED American Army Practically Consists of 111 -Fed Men Waging a Guerrilla Warfare. Special Cable to The Call and New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Qordon Bennett. MANILA, Dec. 6— The hope of ending the Insurrection and halting military operations in the Philippines, which seemed bo bright a few days ago, has again faded into an uncertain futuro. Much has been accomplished. During the last few weeks the campaigning has been almost phenomenal. In dreadful weather, through a devas tated country, across swollen rivers, along roads that wero impassible for wagons, artillery, and in some cases for cavalry, the advance of troops has been so rapid and In so many directions that thf\v have often been beyond military telegraph lines, and operations have ne cessarily been independently conducted by the fleid commanders. The army Is right fully j^roud. The Insurgents have had a series of routs and disasters. The slaughter has been great. They have lost a large quan tity of supplies and munitions of war and more than one thousand of their armed mm have surrendered or been cap tured during their retreats in the few weeks. Their government has been scattered or captured. What of it is at liberty is in Jli«lu. A portion of Aguin aidos family is in our lines. Agulnaldo himself is a fugitive. Notwithstanding all these things there Is no reason for an extreme optimistic view of the situation. Notning more is heard of having the rebellion stamped out in the course of a few days. That sort of talk only lasted while the insurgent leaders were slipping away last week. Field commanders now think that the end is still af.ir. It Is admitted that little is definitely known or' the present strength or whereabout! of the insurgents. Akujii aldo'a entire army ia estimated at mmi twenty to thirty thousand arrm-.i men. scattered through the islands. 1 hire are Ain.-ricm BOldlen DOW in the Philip pines, 35,000 lining in Luzon. Thet already so greatly scattered by recent op eratlom, with the exception of those in Maniln. where 12,000 are cuncentrated, that they Mem like a mere handful. Still we hold less than one-third of the area of Luzon. l>ut what we have la not desir able territory. Indications are that Agiiinaldo escaped to the north with a much !arg<r bod;, .f troopa than was at first Mipposed This force, reported at from 20u0 to 3UOO men, was originally recruited in the northern provinces, and the men are reputed to be & 1 lightera. Not one of our columns is in direct con tact with the enemy. It is a game of hi«io and peek and a weary game It la. Here is a statement of the movements of the various field commanders: General Young, with his small force of 1 1 rt-< 1 int>n and animals, 1? slowly follow ing the Insurgents Into the mountains to ward Banguetl and has not been heard from for a wrk. <;i!tain James. B Erwin, with the Fourth Cavalry, Is supposed to be holding Bayombong in Nueva Vizcaya.

GAGE'S FAVORITE PLANS ADOPTED Successfully Crowded Out Competition. ♦ Special Dispatch to The Call. SACRAMENTO, Dec. 6.— has Just de veloped that the State Capitol Commis sioners, composed oft Governor Gage, Treasurer Reeves and Secretary of State Curry, have' decided upon plans for the Governor's mansion authorized by the last Legislature to be built in the rear of the State Capitol, at a cost of $40,000. It will be recalled that after the bill be came a law Governor Gage, without ad vertising for plans as the law directed. and without offering a premium for com petitive designs as provided for in the act. consulted a linn of architects in his home town of Los Angeles, and with the aid of his wife decided upon the kind of a house he desired to have himself and which all the future Governors of the State must live In. No doubt the Governor, whose will dom inates the Capitol commission, would bare had this house built without more ado but for the opposition of State Con troller <"oigan. who maintained that he could not <ir.'iw warrants for the work unless plans were advertised for as con templated by law. In this contention he was sustained by the Attorney General. The Governor, finding that he could not proceed contrary to law, after much de lay called a meeting of the Commission ers, it was decided to advertise for bids. Inn as no premiums were offered, none Ol iln first-la-:- architects of the State considered it worth while to expend sev eral hundred dollars in the preparation of drawings. Among local architects, n<me of whom bestirred themselves In the matter, it was common talk that the only plans to be submitted would be those first made at the instance of Gage. These predictions were not far astray, for the only plans submitted were those first ob tained by the Governor and those of an other I^os Angeles firm of architects. The Capitol Commissioners met and adopted the original Gage plans, and bids have been advertised for the construction of the residence on those lines. Consider able complaint has been made because of moving eastward from Bocad. It Is his intention to drive the rebel general. Pllar. Into the region north of the lake. General Wheaton is in Tayug. Most of his troops in the vicinity are garrisoning nearby towns. General Mac Arthur 13 on the railroad at Bayombonjc. Colonel Bell Is following westward Into the mountains the remnants of General Alejandrlno's troops, estimated at 2SOO men. Hurt Is moving with a small command from O'Donnell westward over the moun tains to Iba on the coast. General Grant Is moving from Florida Blanca southward to B:ilanga. Bataan Province. Cavito Province will be the seat of an active campaign when enough troops arrive to shut oft all avenues of escape, unless an unexpected surrender occurs. All the 65.000 American troops will be easily absorbed In active campaigning and garrisoning. The army cannot continue Its present exertions another month with the poor food found In the country without much illness. It is the general opinion that the live known Insurgent organizations, of more than 2000 men each, will at the pres ent rate be disintegrated Into guerrilla bands within thirty days. It la the Impression of the military authorities that 20,000 men will be suffi cient to garrison Luzon a few months heni;e. Field officers and others Insist, however, that unless the natives surrender their arms Luzon must be garrisoned town by town, while protection must be guaran teed to the natives now "on the fence" until a reaction In favor of the Americans begins.
