Schsnck, Philadelphia Dear Sir I deem it my duty to you and to all who may be suffering with that awful disease,-Con-suinption, to write to you of the change for the belter that has been made in my wife' condition by you and your great medicine. On August 2!th, 187$, my wife was taken down with Consumptior I called in one of the best doctors in this country. He attended her as faithfully as a maneouid, doing everything in his power, but she got werse every day. In October I called another doctor. They both said she could not possibly live, for she had Consumption, and that her lungs were nearly gone. She was at this time the most pitiful object any person had ever seen, a perfect skeleton, cough in; and spitting large quantities of matter. I tried all kinds of patent medicines that were said to cure Consumption, but nothing did her any srood. On the first of October. tha doctors and all her friends gave her np It was their opionin that she could not live five davs longer By chance I gofone of your books describing many similar cases and their cure, and on the 6th of November l wrote to yon, describing her case You wrote me to give my wife your medicines according to the printed directions and jou thought she could be cured, i at once Dougnt some oi your PULMONIC SYEUP. SEAWEED TONIC and MANDEAZE PILLS, and gave them to her. She began to improve at ouce, although the doctors and her friends said I was throwing mj money away. In a few riava she eat so she conld lav down and s'ecp, a thing she had not been able to do since she v as first taken sick, her appetite imp oved, and I never saw such a wonderful change; every ooay who saw her was astonished, for the like had never been seen in thit country. On the 83d of January you came and exa-nined her lungs with your Respirometor,you pronounc ed her right lung nearly gone, and the left badly aiected (the same thing her former physicians haC said,) but you said she was improving as fast as possible. About the first of June she commenced attending to her household duties, and has continued to do s.) ever since, doing all her own cooking and sew ing for herself and her five children, and to-day she look-s better than she has for ten year. My wife's case iis looked on by the many who saw her as the most wonderfu' cure that has ever besn made in the State of Virginia; it was like raising the dead. Some of the meuieines yon sent me 1 have sold, and they have never failed in giving entire satisfaction inhere Is a gr-at deal of the med icine sold in this vicinity now, and has made other cures almost as wonderful as that of my wife. My purpose is thus writing to you is to benefit others who may be suffering from that dreadful iliseaso. Consumption, and 1 will cheerfully answer nil inquiries that may be made of me whether by l orrespondence or personally, and I can refer to thirty or fortv persons of the highest standing in this community who will vouch for all that X nave written, lours, ec, 6.

SGHEHCES MAFBSAKE PILLS A!ND Seaweed Tonic WILLCURE LIVER COMPLAINT AND DYSPEPSIA. Dr. SCHEME'S MaNDSAEE PILLS Do not produce sickness at the Btomach, nausea or griping. On the contrary, they are so mild and agreeable in their action that a person Buffering with sick headache, sour stomach, or pain iuthe l)Dwcla, is speedily relieved of these distressing symptoms. They act directly on the liver, the organ wh'ch, when in a healthy condition, purifies t he blood of the whole body. They are a perfect preparation of that great and well-known remedy, Mandrake or Podophyllin, a remedy that oas displaced the use of mercury, as well as many other poisonous drugs, in the practice cf every intelligent physician. Prof. John King, of the College of Medicine, of Cincinnati, says : '"In Constipation it acts npon the bowels without disposing them to subsequent costiveness. In Chronic Liver Complaint there is not its equal in the whole range of mediclnee.being vastly more useful than mercurial agents, arousing the liver to healthy action, increasing the flow of bile, and keeping up these actions longer than any other agent with which we are acquainted." (.See American Dispensatory, page 730. In all cases of Liver Complaint or Dyspepsia, where there is great weakness or debility, Da.

The Argus to-day presents its readers with the president's message the same day of its delivery in congress, something which has never before done tc this vicinity. The Argus is enabled to do ihU owinc to the perfect telegraphic arrangements, by which it was transmitted twenty i , hours in advance of its delivery in ccn gress. This is the first time that the president's message has been printed and sent out in newspapers ou the suae day of its reading in congress. We trust that our subscribers will appreciate the efforts we have made to give them tho news in advance. It is our intention to keep up with the times in all things and to do so, respectfully solicit the patronage of busi ness men and ail others who want a lirely, newsy paper. Painful Accident. A very painful accident occurred at 2 o'clock Sanday morning, at Briar Biuff, on the C, B. & Q Railroad, the victim being a young man by the name of llines, a brakeman on Conductor Barter's train. The train was coming north, and had stopped to do some switching, and Dines was told to pull a pin on a car and juaip on the head car and "down brakes." Lie pulled the pin all right and made a jump for the car but missed his footing and fell just outside the track, his arm laying across the track and four cars passed over it, taking it off just below the shoulder. lie was put on the train and brought to Rock Island and taken to the Taylor House. Mr. M. D. Merrili was sent for' and summoned Drs. Truesdale and Garter' who dressed the wounded man's arm. He is a new hand on the road, this being only his fifth trip. Mr. Merrill has him well cared for, and he will -no doubt make a speedy recovery. The Glee Club. We hear it rumored, but not yet con- j firmed, that the Fourteenth Battalion Glee Club intend giving an entertainment in Harper's Theatre before long. The pro gramme, as we are informed, will embrace some of the test local talent io this city and Moiine, some txcalient instrumental music, and selections of readings by our young elocutionist, Mr. Herbert Noarse. We are also informed that Mr. Harper ha3 agreed to let the Glee Club have the theatre for $50, and good instrumental music nil! cost about $30 more, making $80 in all. They thick if they would put the price of admission down to 25 cents for every eeat in the house, they could get a large audience. We hope the club will make up their minds to do this. The people of this city ought to turn out and give them a rousing big house, as they deserve it. They have sang for almost every entertainment that has been given and never asked or received a cent for their aer vices, and if they con clude to give this concert" they should be patronized liberally. I Thank God from the bottom of my heart, that He gave suffering humanity such an excellent remedy as St. Jacobs Oil. having hardly commenced with the use of the first bottle, I already find great relief, and look with lighter heart into the future. !

"Marshal Hawes went to Peoria this afternoon, in respocso to a telegram re ceived Saturday, from the chief of police, stating that they had arrested oae Henry Walker, who stole $25 from Geo.

The jail bill for the month is $18.00. The Davenport Democrat has the' fo! lowing to say of one of MoIines genial business men: Over in Moiine our former townsman, C- Stewart Ella, seems to be thriving finely with the Union Malleable Iron Works, whose President he is.

The president takes strong ground on the enrrency question, favoring the withdraw al and cancellation of the legal tenders and a limited coinage of silver dollars in other words he fayors a single gold standard. He also refers to the issues raised at the late session and repeats his views substantially the same as then. He refers to our de creased shipping interests and urges con gress to take such action as will lead to a reaction.in our favor but makes no sug gestions as to how it is to be done. The Indian question is touched upon lightly and there is a. coincidence with Secretary Schurz's views which shows that he is in sympathy with the present peace policy of the gov ernment. There is very little of especial prominence outside the currency question his views on that question being even more pronounced than at the time of the celebrated silver bill veto. Mr. Hayes voices the sentiments of his party and of coflrse clearly indicates what the people ere to expect from a continua tion of Republican rule. We will notice tho message in detail, at another time. From a hasty perusal, there is ground for classing the message as a decidedly weak state paper eminently characteristic of the man who inspired it, however. Employment for Idle Labor, To-night the council ;meet in regular session, and it is to be hoped that there will be some action taken on the suggestion of The Argus to provide employment during the winter for idle labor. The city can, if it will, furnish work for hundreds of men in this city, give them at least work enough to i keep them independent o charity and above want, lloek can be quarried and kept for.macadan to be used in the spring. The rock can be got out in quantity sufficient to pay for the labor, and at the same time the city will be getting a supply of macadam ahead for street work in the spring. This is a mere suggestion, of course, to the council, I ut it is a questiou which, if acted upon will do -a good work for the laboring men of Rock Island, with really no increase of expenses. Good Words. To-day, S. R. Porter, who for six jears has been tieasurtr oi Rock Island county, retires from the position which he has so al ly and acceptably filled. It is pleasant to note the kiud words of his political opponents and the following from the Davenport Gazette is worth copying. We have endorsed every word of it aod think that everybody will agree with U9 in saying that Samuel R. Porter, was one of the very best county officers ever elected. Following is the item from the Gazette: Mr. S. R. Porter to-day retires from the office of county treasurer, which he has held for the last six years, being twice re elected to that ofSce. He first announced himself as an independent candidate for the ofSce, and repeated the same announce ment at the end of his first and second terms. He was a good soldier when his services w.-re required, and a good officer when he was called to that place. His wurst enemy, if he is lucky enough to have one, can't point to a single dollar that hasn't been tppropriatcd or paid just where it belongs. Mr. Porter will now give his attention to his large coal interest which will occupy all his ticue. Beware cf Malaria.

Iiitle Hands to Begin the Battle Alone. From the Detroit Ftcc Trs. I was walking down one of Detroit's beautiful avenues on a lovely afternoon last week. In front of an ivy-wreathed doorway sat an old lady knitting. A sunny haired little girl ran through the hall and uown the steps into the btreet carrying her doll. Her carls had fallen over her eyes and she stumbled and fell I had her in my arms in an instant. The smile that revealed her dimples and enow white teeth told me that she was neither 1 hurt nor frightened. "What is your name, little one?" "Ain't dot any." "Haven't any name?

Congressman Ilouk, while waiting for the Last-bound tram to convey him to Washington. Monday night, was robbed of his carpet-bag by some unknown party who doubtless laoored under the haliucr nation that the apparently plethoric trav elling companion was freighted with green back bonanzas as the proceeds ot jobs, salary-grabs, etc. Just how the M. C. could be so easily reconciled to bis loss no one was fuily able to explain until yester day, when the carpet-baa; was discovered in tha vicinity of the K. and O. depot. broken open, and tte contents (consisting of a family ls;ble and other literature eel dom perused by a Republican congress man) found unmolested. 1 his is probably the first instance on record where a con gressman has started to W ashington with a Bible supplying the place of a bottle.
