On our first page we give a synopsis of luc annual of the President, or that portion of it whic h is taken tip with th>; consideration of the slavery question, p.ciuw we give Mr. Bcchanan’s views of our afi’iirs with foreign power?, as well oar financial arvd home matters — which, together with the portions referring to the slavery and secession movement, form the principal and important topics of his mes sage. Our relations with other govern ments are thus commented upon in hi? own language; When I entered upon the duties of the Presidential office, neither our foreign nor domestic affairs were at all satisfactory. We were involved in dangerous complications with sev • ral nations, and two of our territo ries wore in a state of revolution against our Government; a restora tion of the African slave trade had numerous and powerful advocates; unlawful military expeditions were countenanced by many of our citizens and were suffered, in defiance of the efforts of our Government, to escape from our shores tor the purpose of making war upon the unoffending people of the neighboring Republics, with whom we were at peace. 1,, H i iiti- n 1 1 lhe?e ami other difFi allies. wo •xperil-need i revolution in monetary affair*. food after njy lubcut. proving of unexampled e verity, and ruinous consequences to the coun try.

GRKAT nitUAIS. Onr r>nations with tlreat Britain are of the most friendly character. Since the commencement i 1 mv administration, the two dangerous questions arising from the Clayton and Bulwer treaty, and from the right of search claimed by the British Gov ernment, have been amicably and honora bly adjusted - The discordant construe lions of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty be tween the two Governments, which nt dif fereut periods of the discussion boro a threatening aspect, have resulted in a final settlement entirely satisfactory to this gov ernment. In my last nnnuaf message I informed Congress that the British Gov eminent had not then completed arrange ments with the Republics of Honduras and Nicaragua in pursuance of the under standing between the two Governments. It was nevertheless confidently expected tfithe good work would ere long be ac complished. This confidence has since been fulfilled. Her British Majesty con eluded a treaty with Honduras on the lihth of November, 1859, and with Nicaragua on the 2bih of August, IhOO, relinquish ing the Mosquito I’roteclorate. Besides by tne former the Bay islands are recog nized as a part of the Republic of Hondu ras. It 111 ay be observe! that tbe stipulation' <>f these treaties conform in every itrqior t itil particular to t'ne amendments adopted si London, < n the 17th ot Octol>er, 1 bf)G between the two government*. It will ho re ;ollc ted that this treaty whs rejected bv tin* British (iovernnient because of it* objection to the just and important amend merit.>t tiie Senate to the article relating to Bunion and li e other islands in the Bn ot’ li iidura . It is a source of sin ceie satist action to all classes of our fellow ril 7‘*ris, and especial I y to those engaged in Ureign commerce, t hat the claim on the I art of threat Britain forcibly to visit and search American merchant vessels on the high seas, in lime of peace, has been aban doned. This was, by far, the most dan porous question to the peace of the two countries which has existed since the war of lbl2. Whilst it remained open, thev might at any moment have been precipi lated into a war. Tbit was rendered manifest by the exasperated slate of pub lie feeling throuhout our enf re country, produced by the forcible search of Ameri can vessels by British cruisers on tbe coast of Cuba, in the spring of JhoS.— I he American people haded with genera! acclaim the orders of the Secret arc of the Navy to our naval force in the (iulf of Mexico, to protect all vessels of the Uni ted States on the high seas from search or detention bv the vessels of war or anv other nation. 1 he*© orders __niight have an unfortunate collision between the naval force-, of the two countries. lice wa rrc.sr fortunately preventer! bv an appeal to the justice of titeat Britain, and to the law of nations as expounded bv her own moat eminent j nists. The onlv question of anv importance which still remains j open, is (lie disputed title between the two 1 governments to the island of San Tuan, in the vicinity of \\ asliington Territory.

MKXICO. O'jr n utionswith Mexico remain in a tuost unsatisfactory condition. In inv two last annual messages I discussal ex tensivelr the abject of thce relations, and do not Dow propose to repeal at length the faets aud arguments then presented Tbey prove com ! naively that our citizens residing in Mexico and our merchant* traiir g thereto. have suffered a series of wrong* and outrages such as we liave ever patiently borne from any nation. For these, onr successive ministers, invoking the faith of treaties, hid, in the name of their lonnlrv, jwrsis’antly demanded red rew and indermnfi. ation, hut without the slightest effect Indeed, so confidential the auiLoji; Leen, L>eca..s*; of our patien endurance, th.it thwv universal ly believe] they rnig l commit their out rages up n Ameri in citizen? with abso lute impunity, Titus wrote our Minister , in 1 >SO. and expre-ae-1 the opinion that nothing but a manifest a’ion of the powers j of the government and of it? purpose to j punish lhee wrong? would nvad, Af er ward?, in 1857, came the adoption of a ne v Constitution hr M-x’Cf, the union of a President and a Congo ?? under it? pro visions, and the inmgura ion of a Prc?i \ dent wi hin one limit month. However, the President w .? expelled from the cap! to! by a rebellion in the army, and the supreme power of the Republic wa? as signed to Gen. Z doaga This usurper was in hi? turn, soon compelled to retire from the place by Ger ea! Miramen. Un | der the Constiulion which had thus been adopted, Gen. Juarez, a? Chief Justice of ; the Supreme Court, became the lawful President of the Republic, and it was for the maintenance of the Constitution, and his authority derived from it, that the civil war commenced, and still continues to be , prosecuted. Throughout tbs year 1858. j the Constitutional parly grew stronger and stronger. In ihe previous history of Mexico a successful military revolution at 1 the capilol had mo?t universally been the , signal for submission throughout the re } public. Not so on the present; a majority rf the citizens persistently sustained the con j stitiitional government. When this whs recommended in April. 1859, by the Gov ernment of the United States, its authori ty extended over a large majority of the t Mexican States and people, including Vera Cruz, and all the important seaports of I the Republic. From that period our corn ' merce with Mexico pegan to revive, and ; the constitutional government hn? afford ! cd it all the protection in their power : Meanwhile the government of Miramon 1 ?till 1 *1 i away nl the Capitol, and over the surround ng country, an 1 continue i ; it? utr ige? against th** few American citi -1 xen i who still had the courage to remain i within it? power. To cap the climax, af ter the battle of Tacubaya, in A-.rit, 1859, Marque- ordered three ( i.izensof the United States, two be se’z a d in the hospit al of that p'rt< , an ! shot without (rial, — This was a- Tic, no;withstanding onr unfor tunate countrymen were at the morneut, engaged in 'he holy cause cf offering re bel to the sold era of both parties wLo had been won ’.el in the battle, without mak ing am distinction 1 etweea them. The time bad arrived in mv opinion,when the (rov eminent was bound to exert its power to aveng and redrew the wrongs of our citi zens, and to aff rd them protection in Mexico. The interposing obstacle was, that the country under the sway of Mira mon, coid I not be reached without pass ing oier territory under (he jurisdiction of Constitutional Government. Under these circumstances. I deem it my duty to recommend Congress ia my last annua! message,the employment < f aufTicieot id'!- litary force to penetrate into the interior where the government of Miramon was to be found, with, or if need be, without the consent of the Juarez government, though it is not doubted his consent could be ob tained. Nevr have I hsd a dearer con viction of any subject than I have of the justice ns well as wisdom, of such a policy. No olht r alternative was loft, except the entire abandonment of our follow—citizens who had gone to Mexico under the faith of treaties, to the systematic injustice, cruelly and oppression cf the Mirarnon Government- Besides it, is certain that a simple audo>ntv to employ this force would of i se!t have accomplished ail our < Ijec.'s without st.i iking a .-ing'e blow.— Toe Cousin j th na l (<overnment would (lien hate been t-nfaivdied at t: e city of Mexico, an ! e. < :d 1 >n\e been ready and willing, to the extent * fits ability, to do us justice in nd btiun. and I deem this a most, important cons dera i *n, Foreign Governineu s wonid have been deprived of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and domei-tc concerns of Mexico, We should thus ’nave been relieved from the obligation of re-isling even bv force, should this ! e -cnie necessary, any attempt by these Governments to depiive our neighboring Republic of portions of her territory, a duty from which we could not -hiink vi'liout abandoning the traditional and established policy of the American peop'e I am happy to observe that, (iruily rely ing npon the justice and good faith of these ( lov- rnrnents, there is no present danger that su h a contingcrcv will bap pen. Having di covered that my re.otn mon bitions woul i r.ut be sustained by Congtess, the r.ex alternative was to a>: comp’i-h in some degree, if possible, the same objects, by treaty stipulations with the constitutional government. Such treaties were nccotdinglv condu led bv our late able and excellent Minister to Mexico, and on the 4li of anuary last were sub milted to the Senate f.r ra'ifi ntion. As the? hare not received the final action of that bo.lv, it would be improper Ur me to present a deta led statement of their provisions. Still I may be paimitted to express the opinion, in advance, that thev ire calculated to p romote the agricultural, manufacturing and commercial in'erest 1 - the country, and *•> sc;m e our just in'- ll non. e with an adjoining K' pul'ltc as to whoe fortunes tint! fate we can never fee! indifferent; whilst at the same turn? they provide for the payment of a con-iderable amount towaids tfie satisfaction of the claims of our injured fellow citizens. 

FRANCK. With Fr inge, our ancient ned powerful ally, uur relations continue to be of the most friendly character. A decision has recently been mad - by a French Judicial Tribunal, web the approbation of the Imperial liov eminent, which cannot fail to fo-ter (he ?en liunuts c,f mutual regard that have ?>> long existed between the two countries. 1 ndor the French law, no jierrou can serve in tho arinicj of France uiuc.-'S he be a French cit izen. Ihe law of France recoin zinc *hc natu ral right of expatriation, it follows ns a ne cessary consequence, that a Frenchman, by the fact of having become n cit * no( the United Sta'es, has changed Ins allegiance and has lost his native character. He can not, therefore, be compelled to serve in the French armies, in case he sno Ii return to his native country. These principle* a ere announced in 1852 by th* 1 French Mii. Ci r of War, and in two fate cases hare been confirmed by the French ,Iu liciary. In these, two natives of France Ua* betu di charged i*,<;i; ;hv rretv.d; ara>7 because they had become American citizens, do employ the language of our preseent Minister to France, who ha? rendered good service on this occasion. •*! do not think our French na/aaliZed fellow citizens "ill hereafter experience mu'-h annoyance on this subject I venture to predict that the time is not fur distant when the other continental powers will adopt the same wise and just policy which has done so m uch honor to the • cnlightefied government ol the Kmperor. In any event, onr government is bound to protect the rights of her naturalized citizens everywhere, to the same extent, though thev had drawn their fir.-t breath in this country. We can recognize no distinction between our na'lve and caluraliz and citizens. 

SPAIN, Our relations with Spain are now of a complicate, though less dangerous character than they have been for many years. Onr citiz- n? have long held, and still continue to hold, numerous claims against the Spanish government, and hese havo hen ably urged for a series of years by our successive diplo matic representatives at Madrid, but with out obtaining redress The Spanish Gov ernment finally agreed to institute a joint commission for the adjustment of these claims and on the fiitli day of March. 1860 concluded a convention for (tint purpose with our present Minister at Madrid. Under this Convention, what has been denominated the Cuban Claim? amounting t 03126. 635. 54. in which more than one hundred of our fellow citizens are interes ted. were recognized, and the Spanish Gov eminent agreed to pay one hundred thous and dollars of this amount within three month? following the exchange of ratifica? cation?. The payment of the remaining 326, 635. 54 was' to wait the decision of the commissioners for or against the Amis? tad claim, tint in any event, the balance was to be paid to the claimants, either by Spain or the United Slates. These terms I have every reason to know, are highly sat isfactory to the, bidders of the Cuban Claime?. Indeed* they have made a for mal offer, authorizing the Slate Depart rr.ent to settle their claims, and to deduct the amount ol the Arnstad chums from the sum? which they are entitled to receive from Spain. This offer of course, cannot be nc cej'ted. Ail other claim.'* ofciUzens of the United States, against Sj'iiu; or of subjects of the Queen of Spain against the United States, including the Amisted claim, were by this Convention referred to a Board of Commissioners in the usual form. Neither the validity of the Amsited claim, nor any other claim against either party, with the single excep tion of Cuban claims, was recognized bv the Convention. Indeed the Span ish Government did not insist that the validity of the Amisted claim should be thus recognized, notwith standing its payment had been reco monded to Congress by two of my predecessors, as well as by myself, and an appropriation tor that pur-- pose had passed the Senate of the Unitd States. They were content that it, should be submitted to the Board for examination and decision like the C iUnr claims. Both Governments were bound re spectively to pay the amounts awar ded to the several claimants, at such times and places as may be fixed by and according to the tenor of said awards, and transmitted by ibis Convention to the Senate tor tneir constitutional action. On the 3d of May, 1360, and on the 27th of the succeeding June, they determined that they would not advise and con sent to its ratification, These pro ceedings place our relations with Spain in an awkward and embarras sing position. It is more than pro bable that a final adjustment of these claims will devolve upon my succes sor. I reiterate the recommendation contained in my annual message of December, 1963, and repeated in that of December, 1353, in favor of the acquisition of Cuba from Spain by fair purchase. I firmly believe that such an ac quisition would contribute essentially to the wellbeing and prosperity of both countries, in all future time, as well as prove the certain means of immediately abolishing the African slave trade, throughout the world. I would not repeat this recommenda tion upon the present occasion, if I believed that the transfer of Cuba to the United States, upon conditions highly favorable to Spain, could jus tly tarnish the national honor of the proud and ancient Spanish monarchy. Surely no person ever attributed to the first Napoleon a disregard of the national honor of France, for trans ferring Louisiana to the United States for a fair equivalent, both in money and commercial advantages. cnivx. The friendly an 1 peaceful policy pursued by U’ e Government of the United Stat-d towards the Empire of China, has produced the most satisfactory result- 1 . The trsaty of Tien tain, of the l a th of June, 185S; has been faithfully observed bv thu Chinese authorities. The Cm vention of the S;h of November, 1853. supple rm-ntcrv to this treaty, for the adjustment a id satisfa tion of the clai.ni of our citizens in Chi ne, tefer e 1 to in rnv In t Message, has already been carried ; nto effect, to far as this was prac ticable.

The claimant* have already received a largs prop, rtion of the sum awarde 1 to the n, out of tiie fund provided, and i*. i.s c..nfi ieuily expe - ted that tne remainder will, ere long, be entire ly paid. After the awards sha'l have been sat isfied. there will remain a surplus of more than s2tiO,o(M) at the disposal ol Congress. As ths will in equity belong to the Caines© Govern ment, would aotjusli-e re (lire it.s approprias ti >n to some benevolent object, in which the Chinese may be especially interested? Our Minister t< China, in obedience to his ir. tructicns, has remained perfectly neutral in the war between Great Britain and France and the Uhinem*Empire, although in conjunction with tne Kus.-ian Minister, he was ever ready and willing, had the oppootnnity offered, tocm ploy h’. g'Kid offices in re-to ring pence between the parti.*.

JAPAS- The ratification of tlie treaty with Japan, conclnd and at Y*-d lo on the 29t'a of July. ISSB, w<-rc exchanged at Washington on tfco 22d of May last, a,id the treaty itself wag proclaimed on the succeeding da\ ,®bere is good reason t f exp'ct 'ha under its protect! n and ii tl icnce. our trade and intercourse with that distant and interesting people, will rapidly increase. The ratifications of the treaty were exchanged with usual so'emnity. F<*r this purpose the Tycoon had accredited thrgs of the most distinguished Ministers i’lenip oentiary.. who were received and treated with marked distintion and kind ness, both by the Government and people of the U, S. There i< evident r-ason to believe that they have returned lo their native laud, entirely satisfied with their visit, and inspired Ky the most friendly feeling for our country.— Let u? ardently hope, in the language of the treaty itself, that there shall hencefirwarl be perpetual fienee and friendship between the United States of America and His Majesty too Tycoon of Japan aud his auaccsao r , SEW CREXAIU. The exchange of the ratifications of the Con vention with the Republic of Hew Grenada, signed at Washington on the 10th of September 1857, has been so long delayed from accidental cause, for which neither jarty is censurable. These ratifications were duly exchanged in this city on the sth of Novctnbe* last. Thus has a controversy been amicably terminated, which had become so serious at the period of my in auguration as to require me. on the 17th of Ap ril, 1557, to direct our Minister to demand his passports and return to the United States. Un der this condition, the Government of New Grenada has specially acknowledged itself to bo re sponsible to our citizens for damages which were caused by the riot at Panama on the 15;h April 1856. These cl dins, together with other claims of onr citizen* which have been lung urged in vain, are referred for adjustment to a board of Commissioners. I submit a copy of the Convention to Congress, and recommend the legislation necessary to carry it into effect. COSTA RICA AXD NICARAGUA. Persevering efforts have been made for the adjustment uf the claims of American citizens against the Government of Post a Ri ca, and I am happy to inform you that these have finally prevailed; a Convention was signed at the city of San dose, on the 2d of July last, between the Minister resident of the United Stales in Costa Rica, and the Plenipoten iaries of that Republic, referring those claims to a Board of Commissioners, and providing hr payment of their awards. This Convention will be submitted to the Senate for their constitutional action. The ciaims of our citizens upon the Republic of Nicaragua, have not yet been provided for by treaty, although dilligent efforts for this purpose have been made by our Minister resident in that Republic. These are still continued with a fair prospect of success. 

RUSSIA. Between the great Empire of Russia and the United States, the mutual friendship and regard which as so long existed, still continues to prevail, and if possible, to in crease. Indeed, our relations with that Em pire are ah that we could desire. AUSTRIA, &C. With the Empire of Austria an.! the remaining continental powers uf Europe, including that, ofthe Sultan, our relations continue to be of the most friendlv character. KANSAS AND UTAH At tLr period of my inauguration I was confronted in Kansas by u i-X'.liOiuuttrv government, existing nr:un’ " hat was called tho Topeka Constitution. Its avowed object was to subdue the Territorial government by force, and to inaugurate what was called the Topeka government in its stead. To accent plish this object, an extensive military organ ization was formed and its command entrus t( (1 to the most violent revolutionary leaders. Under these circumstances il became my im perative duty toexert the whole constitution al power of the Executive tu prevent the flames of civil war from raging in Kansas, which from the existing state of the public, mind both in the North and the South might have extended into the neighboring States. The hostile parties in Kansas had been in flamed against each oilier by emissaries both from the North and South, to a degree of malignity with out parallel in our history. To pre vent eventual collision and to resist the civil magistrates in enforcing the laws, a strong detachment of the ar my was stationed in the Territory, ready to aid the Marshals and his deputies when officially called upon as a posse comitatus in the execution ot civil and crimin and processes. Still the troubles in Kansas could not have been permanently settled with out an election by the people, the ballot boxet being the surest arbitra tor of disputes among freedom. Under this conviction, every pro per effort was employed to induce the hostile parties to vote at the election of delegates to frame the State Con stition, and afterwards at theelection to decide whether Kansas should be a slave or free State. The insurgent party refused to note at, either, lest this might be considered asia recog nition on their part of the Territorial government established by Congress A better spirit, however, seemed soon after to prevail, and the two parties me face to face in the elec tion, held the first Monday of Janu ary, 1858, for members of the Leg islature and State officers, under the Lecompton Constitution. The re sult was the triumph of the anti Sla very party of the polls. The decision of the ballot-box proved clearly that this party were in the majority, and removed the danger of civil war. From that time we have heard nothing of the Topeka Government, and all serious danger of revolutionary troubles in Kansas was then at an end. The Lecompton Constitution, which had been thus recognized at this State election, by the votes of both political parties in Kansas, was transmitted with the re quest that I should present it to Congress. This I could not have re fused to do, without violating my clearest and strongest convictions of dutv. The laws, and all the proceedings which preceded and tollowed its for mation, were fair, and regular on their face, and what I then believed and expressed has proven true; the interests of the people of Kansas would have been best consulted by its admission, as a State, into the Union, especially as the majority within a brief period, could have amended the constitution recording to their will and pleasure. It fraud existed in anv or all of these procee dings, it was not for the President, I it for Uongrcss to ‘,nwstiga*e and determine tile question of fraud, and wl.at aught to be the consequences. If at the two first elections fhe ma jurity refused to vole, it cannot be pretended that this refused to exer cise the electoral franchise could in \ alid;te"an election fairly held under lawful authority even if they had not voted at the third election. It is true that the whole Constitution had not been snbmitted'to the people, as I always desired, but the precedents are numerous of the admission of t?tate into the Union without such admission. It would not comport with my present purpose to review the proceedings of Congress upon the Lccompton Constitution. Peace has also been restored with in the Territory of Utah, which, at the commencement of my adminis tration, was in a state of open rebell ion. This was the more dange rous, as the people animated by a fanatical spirit, and entrenched with in *thcir mountain fastness might have made a long and formidable resistance. Cost what it might, it was necessary to bring them into subjection to the Constitution and the laws. Sound policy, therefore,as well humanity, required this object should, if possible, be accomplished without the effusion of blood. This could only be effected, by sending a military force into the Territory, sufficiently strong io [con vince the people that resistance would be hopeless, and at the same time to offer them a pardon for past offences, on condition of immediate submission to the Government. This policy was pursued with eminent suc cess; and the only cause for regret is flie heavy expenditure required to march a large detachment of tiie army to that remote region, and to furnish its subsistence. Utah is now comparatively peaceful and quiet, and the military has been withdrawn except that portion of it necessary to keep the Indians in check, and to protect the emigrant trains on their way to our Pacific posessions. 

FINANCES In my first annul message I promis ed to employ my bert exertions in co operations with Congress to reduce the expenditures of the government within the limits of wise and judici ous economy. An overflowing treas. had produced habits of prodigality and extraviganee, which could only be gradualy corrected. The work required both time and patience. T applied myself dilligently to this task from the beginning, and was aided by the able and energetic efforts of the h* ads of the different Executive departments. The results of our la bors in this good cause did not ap pear in the sum tot i! of our expendi tures for the first two years, mainly in consequence of the extraordinary expenditures necessarily incurred in Ur.hli expidition, and the very large amount of the contingent ex. penscs of C digress, during this peri ol, These greatly exceeded the pay and mileage of the members- For tiie year ending 30<U June; 1858, whilst the pay and the millage a mounted •"?!. 49).214, the contingent expenses rose to §2, 0 )3, 70, and for the year ending June, 1859. whilst the pay and mileage amounted to §859, 093.(50 the contingent expenses amounted t§ 1, 131,505. 73. I am h igpy, however,t• be able to inform you that during the last fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June, 1860, the total expenditures of the government in all it- branches. Legislative,*' Ex ecutive and Judicial, exclusive of Public Dept, wore reduced to the sum os § 55,409,405,40. This conclusively appears from tho books of tho Treasury, in the year ending on tbc 30th June 1.858. The total expenditure.exclusive f the public debt, amounted to $71.K01. 120.77 and that for the year ending 30th June I SAD, to $(56,348,226 13; whilst the books of the Trea sury show an actual expenditure of $ '>o,B3'), 171. 72 t.>r tho year ending 30th June, 1850. includ ing $1,010,067 71 for the contingent expenses of Congress. There must b-3 dec ucted from this umoiint the sum of $3,208,090 26, with tho interests unon it, of $1.30,i11i11. at preprinted by the act of loth February, 1860, for the purpo-o of supplying the deficiency in the revenues and defraying the expenses of tho Post Office de partment for tho year end; ig 3>'th June, 1859. This sum, therefore, justly chargeable to tho year 1859, inu-t be deducted from the utn of $38,848 575 72. in or lor t > ascertain the expon ture for tho year ending 30th Juno. 1360. which leavos a balance for the expenditure of th it ye ir of $.35,402.16.3 -46. The iiuere-t on the debt, including Treasury notes f>r the same fine-. 1 year ending on tho 30th June iB6O, amounted to $3,177,314 62, which al<lcd to the above sun of $53.-402,403 46, makes the aggegato o-$ >8,579,789 06. It ought in justice to he observed, that several of th3 es timates f. on all the department for tho year ending 30th June, 1850, were reduced by Con gress below wh.it was, and still is, de one 1 coins patible with the publi: interest. Allowing a li beral margin of $250,006 for this reduction,and for other causes, it may be safely asserted that tho sum of $61,609,000 or at the most $62,000,- 000 is amply sufficient to administer the govern ment and pay the interest- on the pu’olic debt, unless contingent events shout I hereafter ren der extraordinary expenditures necessary. This result has been attained in a degree by tho c.nro exercised by the appropriate departments in outeriug into public contracts. ■AFRICAN MVK TRADE. Tt i with great satiO'action I ''nrnrannicato tbo (act that, duce the 'late of my la=t annual message, not a single slave has been imported into the Unite! >‘ates in violation of the laws prohibiting the African Slavs train. This state ment is founded upon a thorough examination and investigation of the subject. Indeed the spirit which prevailed some livjo since among a portion of our fellow citizens in favor of this trade, scctn„ to have entirely subsided I also congratulate you upon the public sentiment which n>w exists against the crime in setting on foot military expedition* wi:hin the limits of the United States, to proceed from thence and make war upon the people of an unoffending State within whom we ara at peace. In this re spect a happy change has been effected since the commencement of ray aim ministration. It surely ought to bathe pnyar of every Christi an and patriot, that such expclUiuns may never receive countenance in our country or depart from our shores. EI.ECTIOX or WRVtBRRS Of CoXORKSS. I agni recommend to f'rmg-cn the passage of a Lor, in pnr-omco o'the provi ions ot the Constitution, appointing a cuts; lay previous to the 4lh of M >rch in ca'-h year of an odd number for the election of Kcpre curatives throughout all the sta’es. A similar power has already been exercised with general approba tion, in the appointment of the same day thro’- out lbs Uni >n lor holding the election f r Elec tors ot President and Vice President of the U. S. My attention was learnesily directed to this subject from the fact that the .Jots Congress terminated on the 3d of March, PJd. without making ‘he necessary appropriation for the rer vi: e ot the Post Office Department, and I was then forced n, consider the bc v l remedy for fh s omtnisslon ar. l an iiame bate call af die present Congress was ihe usual resort. Upon inquiry however. I asserted that fifteen out of the 33 States compysing the confederycy, were with out representatives, aad consequently fifteen states would ba disfranchised by such a call. These fifteen states will be in the same condi tion on the 4th of March next. 

TARIFF. It is now quite eertnin that the financial ne cessities of tac government w.ll require a mo dification .f the Tariff during the present ses sion, for the purpose of increasin' THE REVENUE. In this respect I desire to reiterate the recomendation contained in my la* two an nual messages, in favor of imposing specific, instead of ad valorem duties on aH imported articles to which these can properly be ap plied. From long observation and expert ence, I am convinced that specific duties are necessary, both to protect revenue, and to secure to our manufacturing interests that amount of incidental encouragement which unavoiJably results from a revenue tariff. As an abstract proposition, it may be ad mitted that ad valorem duties wouhi, in tlie, ory, be the most just and equal, but if the experience of this and all other commercial nations has demonstrated that such duties cannot he levied and collected without great fra .ds upon the revenue, then it is the part of wisdom to resort to specific duties. In deed, from the very nature of an ad valorem duty this must be the result. Under it the inevitable consequence i that foreign goods will be entered at less than their full valuv The Treasury will therefore lose the duty on the difference between their real an : fic titious value, and to this extent we arc de frauded. The temptations which a 1 valo rem duties present to a dishonest importer, are irresistible. His objects is to pass his goods through the on-tom house at the very lowest valuation necessary to savet hem from confiscation. In this he too often succeeds, in spite of the vigdance cf the revenue offi cers. Hence the resort to false invoices, one for the purchaser, another for the cus tom house; and to other expen lients to de fraud the government. The honest impor ter produces his invoice to the collector, sta ting the actual price at which he purchased the'articles aboard. Not so the dishonest importer, and the agent of the foreign mans ulacturer. And here it may bo observed that a very largo proportion of the foreign manufactures imported from abroad, are consigned for sale to commission merchants, who are mere agents employed by the man ufacturers. In stch cases, where no actual sale has been made to fix their value, the foreign manufac urer, if he be dishonest prepares an invoice of the goods, not at their actual value, but at the very lowest rate necessary to escape detection. In this man ner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decided advantage over the honest merchant. They are thus enabled to undersell the fair trader and drive him from the market. In fact, the opera tion of this sys/cm has already driven from the pursuit of honorable commerce many of that class ol regular and conscientious mer chants, whose character throughout the world is the pride of our country The remedy for those evils is to be fount! in spcciSe duties, so far as this may bj praefiea bie. They dispense with any inquiry at the C ; ’urn House info the actual c st or value of the article, and it pays the precise amount of duty previously fixed by law. They present no temptations to the appraisers of foreign goods, who receive but smell salaries, and might by uadervalution in a few cases, ren ler themselves independent. Besides, specific duties best con form to the revuisition in the Constitution. <h if no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports td one State over those of another. Under our ad valorem system such prefer ences are, to some extent, inevitable, and complaints have o'f'ii been made, that the spirit of this provision has been violated by a lower appraisement of tlie same articles at one port than a I another. An impression strangely enough prevails to som s extent, that specific duties are necessarily protec tive duties. Nothing can bo more fallacious Great Britain glories in free trade, and yet her whole revenue from imports is at the pretest moment collected under a system of specific duti<*s. It is a striking fact, in this connection, that in the commercial treaty of 231 of Jan uary, 1860, between France and England, one of the articles provides that the ad va lorem duties wiiich i t imposes shall bo con verted into specific duties within six mouths from its date, and these are to be ascertain ed by making an average of the prices for six months previous to that time. The reverse of the propusion would be nea rer to the truth because a ranch larger amount of revenue would bo collected by merely con verting the adivalor ira dutic* of a tariff into general evaivalent specific duties. To this ex tent the revenue would be uicreased aod in tho same proportion the specific duty might be di minished. Specific duties would secure to the American manufacturer the incidental protao- tiou to which ho is thinly entitlod under tho re venue tarrifF, an i to this surely n> person would ohjeof. Under the present system it has been of ten truly remarked that this incidental pro tection decreases when the manufacturer needs if most, and incieases when he needs it least, and constitutes a.sliding scale which always operates against him. The revenues of the country are subject to similar Hue na tions, instead of approaching a steady stan dard as would be the ca-.e under a system of specific duties. They sink and rise with the sinking an 1 rising prices of the articles in foreign countries. It would not be diffi cult for Congress to arrange a system of specific duties, which would afford add tion at stability both to our revenue and our manufacturers, and without injury or injus tice to any interest of the country. This might be accomplished by ascertaining the average value of any given article for a se ries ot years at the place of exportation, and by simply converting the rate of ad va lorem duty upon it which might be deemed necessary for revenue purposes in the form of a specific duty, buck an arrangement could not injure the consumer ; if he sbo’d pay a greater amount ol duiy one year this would be counterbalanced by by a lesser amount the next, and in the end the aggre gate would be the same. I desire to call your immediate attention to tho present con dition of the Treasury, so ably and clearly represented by the Secretary in his report to Congress, and to recommend that measures bo promptly adopted to enable it to dis charge its pressing obligations. The other recommendations of the report are well wor thy of your favorable consideration, I herewith transmit to Congress the re ports of ihe Secretary of VV ar, of the Navy, of the Interior, and of the Postmaster Gen eral. The recommendations and suggestions wliich they contain are highly valuable, and deserve your careful attention- The report of the Postmaster General de tails the circumstances under which Corue hds Vanderbilt, on my request, agreed in the month of July la.->t, to carry the Ocean mails between our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. — Had he ujl thus acted, this important inter o" c co nmuuication must have been sm puideJ, • lease for a season. The Post nia-lcr General had no power to make him any oiher compensation than the postages on mail matter which he might carry. It was known at the time, these postages wo’d fall far short of an adequate compensation as well as of the sum which the same ser vice ha-< previously cost the Government.— Mr. Va derbilt in a commendable spirt, wav <a Ming to retv upon the j itics of Coe- gress to make up the deficiency, and I there fore recommend that an appropriation b granted for this purpose. I should do great injustice to the Attor ney ticneral were I to omit the mention of his distinguished services in he measures ad opted and prosecuted by him for Ibe defence of the Government against numerous and unfounded claimsTo land in California, pur porting to hare been made by the Mexican Government, previous to the treaty of ces sion. The successful opposition to these claims has saved to fheU.S, public property worth many millions of dollars, and to indi viduals holding title under them, at least au equal amount.
