Ti/ii President declines cautiously to dub himself a Free Trader; but lie lakes up a free trade jwsilion without disguise. He and the leaders of the Democratic party have taken up again the old free trade policy of the South Cumlina politicians.?London Saturday Rexiew, Tiik now President of the Baltimore & Ohio la young and experienced. With the roal on an improved footing, and with soma costly mistakes of former manage* ment to guido him, he should be able to diachargo his duties acceptably to the public and the stockholders. How the British organs of Cleveland and freo trade are howling in a transport of delight over the President's message of comfort and joy. They seem to think it has all the force of a royal decree. Let them come on. We can wallop the whole caboodle of thorn, with Cleveland thrown in. THE President does not seem to perceive the rjfect of his own arguments, or even the meaning of his own words. His statement that the question of free trade is irrelevant is astounding and preposterous. Protection, albeit indefensible, is the height cf wisdom compared willi proposals which combine all the evils of interference with all the risks of liberty,?London DaVy News. Ex-Banker Harper went through on the Oolnmbua express. The corner he finds himself in ia much narrower than a Chicago wheat corner. He has a wife, jast as the Anarchist murderers had, but nobody fseema to have thought of that as a reaoon wby he Bhould not pay the pen-' alty of his crime. By the way; Harper was a sort of Anarchist himself. He set himself agflinot the law of honesty and wrecked his life. vIarpkh'h laitiiful wife was faithful to the2ast. 8ho overlooked if eho did not forgot that In the days of his prosperity he j lavished his money and his attention on another woman. In the hour of his diegraco and misery, the shadow of the penitentiary hanging over him, tho woman' ho had wronged supported him with the arms of her love. That Bhould have been to him a torture the most exquisite; and so it was if his heart is not a more gizx ltd. __________________ Tiie Third party has determined through it? committee to put a ticket in the held in thii Stato next year. This may hurt or help prohibition. No matter. The first thing is the party and the next thing its ticket. If prohiibtionjcannot tana care 01 ik'olf, go much the worao for prohibition. The comments of Judge Ferguaon on this phase of the question are pointed and intc.'PGtinjr. He wants to know, among other' thing*, -where the Third party men expeci to get the aevonty odd thousand votes necessary to carry the amend mont, if they cannot ba had from the old and altogether depraved parties. On another page appears Judge Fargttfio.u'd reply to Mr. Oarekadon, who believes the saving grace of a Third partv. That ide. * has been atoatly combattedby others before Jndge Fergueon entered the lists, but it h^ never been more soundly and roundly ti* nmped, . Judge Ferguson pnts the Third party movement in a vory nnattractive light, but this is ;the light in fyhich it has placed itsolf. The vory fact ol lu1* being is hostile to the idea on which itia proxf"fisod to have been founded. It talks prohibition, but it "will not consent to prohibition without a Third party. This is not temperane^ #frt total abstinonce, not prohibition. Jtia politics, and not a very exalted kind P* politics. We do not aay that none of the men who take the viowof tho political prohibi. tioaiats are honest; we only aay that tho honest men in that movement are blind beyond belief.1 As a Democrat who believes in prohibition, and one who know how to wield the pen witli unusual force, Judge Ferguson's article merits the close reading which it is sure to get. 01 course Mr. Oarskadon will be heard from again, for ho is a man not easily "downed," There may be others who will come to the front on one side or the other. The Intelligencer welcomes them, for a question of so much importance should be well ventilated in the public prese. TUB

FISUKKY TIZBLE. CommlnBloneri Abandon All ilope of Formulating a General Treaty. Washington, Dec. 12.?It is believed here that the Fishery Commission having given np all hope of formulating a general treaty, and that the moat thev hope to accomplish is an agreement on a protocol defining anew the meaning of certain clansea of the troaty of 1818, sach as those relating to bait, to repairs and snpplios and to the trans-shipment in bond across Canada of American llah. It is nndorstood that such a protocol, if it is agreed on, will bo merely explanatory of the old treaty, and wonld not havo to be pent to the Senate for action, bat, if acceptable to the State Department, will provide a mode of action lor the fatnre. The long recess, it is understood, was taken at the instance of Mr. Chamberlain, who found it necessary to send his communication to the British Foreign Office by mail and to await farther suggestions by mail, all of which requires folly three weeks. The uncertainty of any agreement involving commercial privileges being recognized by CongreES, even if a treaty should be ratified by the Senate, has been made clear to Mr. Chamberlain by the Gtatus of the reciprocity troaty with New Mexico, which the Hoobo of Representatives has to date refused to recognizd by the necessary act to carry it into effect. An Ottawa special says that the long adjournment is regarded in Canadian official circles as a total collapse of the negotiations. Uug;?m0 UUgluH to Katlre. Washington. D.

TROUBLE. An Itemized Account Demanded bjr tlie General Executive Board. Philadelphia, Dec. 12.?At a meeting of the representative men from nearly all the local assembries of the Knights of Labor, hold yoaterday afternoon, resolutions wore adopted recommending that all the local asaemblies make demands upon the General Executive Board for an itemized account of all the expenditures made by that body during the past year, so that they may know where and how the $5,000 was disbursed. If the General Executive Board should fail or decline to render such an account, it is proposed to compel it to do so by law. This matter has been under consideration among the members of the local assemblies, it is alleged, for several months, &nd it has now assumed definite shape. It is also alleged that over $10,000 has been di^bnrced by the Board for "special work," and tbie, it is said, is the cause of the^teps taken at the meeting. ropNDATLAST.

Cincinnati, Dec. 12,?Tho groatoit crowd that has over gathered In the corridors of the United Bitten Court room unuembled this mornlsg long before tie time for the aeeomblinn ol tho court. It was simply Impoialblo for ladles to not In nt tho public door, and only thoio who had frionds to ohowthem tho private entrances coald reach tho court room. At 10 o'clock Judge Sago appeared alono, Judgo Jackson having baen callod to hold court iu Covington. Court was oponed, and sevon minutes later the jury filed in. As ooon aa they were eoated Judge Sage asked if they had agreed upon a verdict, and tho foreman oaid they had. The Judge directed tho clerk tn .metye it? At this point Mr. Blackburn called the Court's attention to tho abBonco of tho defendant. "Lot him ba brought in," said tlie Judge. Ia two minutes Marshal Urner'entorod. [ollowod by Mr. Harper, looking palo and anxious. Behind him came hia wife, her face a study. It looked as ii she was upborne by a faith that in some way sho was to hear good news from th9 jury. Miea Matthews followed as calm as she could composo hersolf to bo. When they were seated the clerk took the sealed envelope inclosing the verdict, tore .it opon and read the fatal words: "\Ve, the> jury, find tie defendant guilty as charge i in tho indictment." This meant guilty, on all the thirty-three counts loft for the jury to act upon. There waa no outcry trom either of the women. Mrs. Harper Bat; as if transfixed, but Miss Matthews found relief in tears which she struggled with all her power to repress. Mr. Blackburn moved an arreat of iudirment. which tho fJnnrfc Jna?an*lw 'overruled. Then District Attornoy .Barnet moved for immediate sentence, and that the sentence be cumulative. tub sentence. Judge Sago, in a bo me what lengthy opinion, stated the result of his investigatiou on the question of cumulative sen* tences in a caso like this, and gave some relief to the suddenness of the blow upon Mr. Harper's family. The Judge finally overruled the motion, and asked if the defendant had anything to say before sen* tenco was pronounced upon him. Mr. Blackburn arose and said that the defendant wished to speak through him, and to say that he had nothing to add to what had been said, except to thank the Court for its fair aud impartial treatment, and to ask that tho Coart be as morcifal as the circumstancos and tho law would permit. At 10:25 the Court directed Harper to stand up. It was a most distressing scene. The strong man stood erect, with tears coursing down hiB cheek, but no otter sign of emotion, save his blanched face. Behind his chair with bowed head, sat his wife in agony that had no bettor manifestation than tho wringing of her hands. Tears did not come to her reliof. Mrs. Matthews,-far more demonstrative, still repressed sobs, and iu her own distress reachod over to try to comfort hor sistor by a touch. 80 thoy eat, while the Court with impressive solemnity recited tho usual form of sentence, saying the evidence left no doubt of tho defendant's guilt and that the oflense merited the highest penalty of the law, which the Court could now impose, ten years in the Ohio penitentiary and that the marshal UUUtoj U1U1 vuiiUUl an UUU3, Still no outcry. Mr. Harper eat down, taming to his wifo. Their lipa met; lier hands were around hie neck, hig arms encompassed her. The eilence in the court roomwao oppressive. Jurors wept, men and womon all over the court room were in tears. The silence was brokon by Mr. Blackburn making a last request from the Court, namely, that the order lor immediate imprisonment be suspended, giving as a 10aBon that there was much business to bo attended to by Mr. Harper in which his wife was closely concarnod, and it would be exceedingly difficult to attend to it unless Mr. Harper could romain hero for a fow days. Bat the Court was relentless. Judge 8age Baid thero would be opportunity for Harper's wife to soo him in Ooiuoibus, and ho repeated his order to tho Marshal to convey him thither to-day. TAKEN TO THE PENITENTIARY. After the ecenea in the court room Harper and his family spent some time in the Marshal's office and then went to the jail, where he spent the afternoon in his room preparing for his departure. The bedding, hie trunk and other property were taken out and sent to his house. His family joined him and he bade them goodbyo. Mrs. Harper lingered after the otliors had departed and her farewell was spoken with him alone. A moment afterwards she appeared as unmoved as ever. 8hortly before 4 o'clock a carriage appeared at the jail, into which Harper and the deputy marshals, Kiersted and Castello, entered and wore drivon to the Central passenger depot, passing on the way his late residenco on Fourth street. There was a small gathering of peoplo there to see him enter the train, but the deputies avoided the front entrance bv ttoinir down John streak nnd an.1 tering the depot irom the west end.

Thousands of Bparks swept over those, and great cv)wds of excited people BP66dily iammed the atreeta. Phelps, Dodge & Co.'s establishment occupied a quarter of a equaTe and was a solid-looking five-story pile of masonry and iron, but the upper llaor succumbed with astonishing rap:dity.

1UO0CUKO niu IUCC1VOU UI JiUgland with an oppression of joy. The one thing for which England hungers and thirsts io free admission of Britiah manu- 1 factures to American markets. I have ! never met an Englishman who doubted i that 11 the United 8tatcB wonld bnt adopt i free trade British fabrics would Bpeodily 1 drive American fabrics out of American j markets. "Your employers," said a great t English employer, "dare not roduco wages to our level. How can they compete with f as if they do not?" There is the whole question. When Mr. Cleveland's message came over, the Englleh papers, carriod away ( with their delight, flpoke out freely. They i have since been warned that British sup- c port is not precisely what the American c Prosldent wants when he attacks Amerl- c can interests. So thoy ore more cautious. But their ilrot deliverances ore conclusive. "Mr. Cleveland's policy/' said the Times, "may not establish free trade in the strict sense of the torm. But it will to a great ' extent make trade frao." Neither tho 1 Times nor any other journal careB a straw d abont Mr. Cleveland's academic resorva- o tions in favor of the manufacturer, a FOE 

REVENUE ONLY. "The President," eaid the Daily Newt, g "dooa not Beom to perceive the effect of his own argumonts, or even the meaning of hia own words. His statement that the t question of free trado is irrelevant is as* a tonnding and preposterous. Mr. Cleveland has persuaded* himself to think, or K dnds in convenient to say, that the princi- c ple of fostering nativo industries by dutieB c on foreign imports can be made compati- a ble with the principle of regulating the t ourdens upon the people by the needs of *] the public service. It is pure delusion. j Protection, nlboit indefensible, is the e height of wisdom comnarml with * which CDmbine all the evils of interference I with all the risks of liberty." 80 this <i journal, like all others, considers Mr. \ Cleveland's proposals, in spite of all at- j tempts at limitation, as equivalent to a c declaration for free trade pure and simple, j The Standard, too, ridicules what it calls i hia soothing parenthesis about consider- ? irg the interests of Amorican\labor. "His 1 real meaning is that the scheme by which i the artificial fabric of domestic enterprise 1 has beon bailt up in America is lunda- 1 mentally vicious. He demands in effect 1 that there should be a tariff for revenue j purposes only." ? Tho weekly journals hold similar views, t Tho Economut, the leading financial jour- [ nal of this country, expresses itself with 1 reserve for the reason above given. But \ its articlo is oae long panegyric on Mr. ] Cleveland's message from a purely free 1 trade point of view. "President Cleveland j is to be honored for his outspoken advo- 1 cBcy of sound fiscal principles,"' Bays the t Economist. What does that mean? Who c does not know that in its mouth "sound I fiecal principles" mean 

RANK HIKE TRADE? ^ The Spectator is plain spoken and em- z phatic: "The President's terse and tell- v Lng message has struck a blow at Ameri- ? can protection sach as never could have e been struck by any Free Trade Lsague." ii The Saturday Hetiew, I need not remind s you, is a bitter enemy of America. It is 1 o?r the President's eulogist. "Ho declines cautiously," says our life-long foe, I 'to dub himself a Free Trader; but he " takes up a free trade position without dis- a suise. Ho and the leaders of the Demo- p sratic party have taken up again the old b free trade policy of tho South Carolina pol iticians." Tho great provincial journals st Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Coeds, Newcastle, and elsewhere, all unite in this lyrical celebration of Mr. Oleve- 11 land in his new character of the British Manufacturer' Best Friend. To represent the English as anxious e Lest free trade in America should reault n in making America a formidable competitor with England in the markets of tho 6 world is the shallowest of futile disguises, c; Free trade dogmatists are bound to affirm a it as the logical consequence of their theo- *( riea, but they affirm it with their tongues in their cheeks. Every practical Eng- ? iishman knowB the immediate reault of " Mr. Cleveland's policy would bo an enor- ?, mous increaeo of English exports to America. That is why they hail it with a hal- a wiujan. it will empty American pocketa ? to till English ones. It will stifle strug- ^ ?ling American industries and cripple P those which are prosperous. It will make the English the arbitera of American proa- * perity. ^

In oonnoction with Mr. King's Mlgnation there la an interesting stoiy: t la authoritatively stated that ho wlthrew hecaase ho hail been Informed that armonlous relatione conld not exist hereon himself and the powers that be. In Is lottor ol resignation ho gives a history t his connection with tho road and inkcs public many things associated with is company's embarrassments not hith to published. Go showa that na far ack as 1885, when Robert Garrett was ected President tho llrat time, the Proa!ent informed him that tho company w a i need of additional fnnda to curry n a affairs, and that ho (King) and eneral Counsel Oowen nogotiat* d id Pittsburgh division loan. In icuriag this loan, he says. they were roatly antagonized by New "iorkere. Mr. '.tng aaya when he took charge of tho niladelphia extension tho Baltimore & hio had no contract with tho Reading, hich line it was intended to use to New 'ork. The charter of.the Schuylkill ;iver East 81de Railroad, over which loy muat dopend for a Philadelphia en* anco, waa veated in the Reading, and ir this a largo sum waa asked of the altimoro & Ohio. Ho intimates that thia '&a an unpardonable piece of stupidity, lending millions of money in the con* ruction of a line without any deflnito rrangement for getting it into Philadolhia, or through to New York. He finally erected the trouble by obtaining tho last Side road chartor for $01,175, and a aluable contract with the Reading coinany. 

INTERESTING STATEMENTS. Mr. King then states without reservaon, tho oxact cost of contracting tho hiladelphia line which haa alwaya been ' mooted question among outsiders. Tho ital coat, including the East fiido rail>ad, up to Saptember.30,1887, was $14,33,017. Tho loans placed upon thia roperty amount to $16110 000 Thero ia, lerefore, a remainder of $1,922 083 from iese loana. Of thiB amount $825,000 will a required to double track twoatv-fivo tilea betweon Philadelphia and Baltilore to complete tho PhiladelpLla paa?nger station and the terminal facilitioa jntemplated on the Delaware rivor. Tho imaindor ho thinka ample to pay all ndlated rights of way. During tho past threo ears Mr. King has assisted in negotiating iana aggregating $19,500,000 Then comes is following paragraph: "It ia proper for le to here refer to barBh and unfavorable :iticiam which haa been made regarding ' ly connection with tho Ives-Sully n??goation. Robeit Garrett, ao an individual ad nearly all the loading Baltimore stockoldera entered into an agreement to sell leir individual holdinga. Tho tranoacon waa in their private capacity and no (ficial connection was held by the cornany crit8 officers. A.a a personal friend [ Robert Garrett I had a knowledge of io negotiations, but not until they made raaiderable progrosa. Tho only Eubaeaent negotiations I have had in the conoction with the financial affairs of tho impany was in July last, wkon a largo im of money was raised by me in New ork and Pittsburgh to tide over a don iroub period, xaio monoy saved the impany from disaster at tho time." Mr. King has forwarded to tho reapect0 boards his resignation as president of le Schuylkill R;ver East Sido Railroad srapany, Sharpvillo Railroad Company, ilisbury Railroad Company, Fairmont, organtowu & Pittsburgh Railroad Corniny, and Wheoling, Pittsburgh & Bilmore Railroad.

CONCERNING MR. BPESCE8. It has boon stated that Proaidont Spends salary will be $25,000 por year. This ems like a great deal of money for one an to draw for a year's work, but all ingB considered, porhapa it ia not too ucn.
