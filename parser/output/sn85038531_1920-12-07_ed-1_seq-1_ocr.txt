MESSAGE NOT 

DELIVERED IN PERSON No Mention of League of Nations; Recommendations Included Loan for Armenia; Independence for Phil ippines, Economy During War Recovery, Revi sion of Tax Laws, Aid for Disabled Soldiers, Measures Affecting High Cost of Living. Washington, Dec. 7. Calling at tention to the fact that the United State la the "aample democracy of the world," and a auch la con atantly under world scrutiny. Pres ident Woodrow Wilson In his1 last congressional message today urged upon congress the duty of making this nation the champion of right and Justice In world affaire. Only by rectifying wronga within Our own borders and championing the right wherever It Is In danger, the president pointed out, can the United Statee fulfill Its destiny and keen faith with the fathers of the republic. The president's message made no mention of the league of nations, nor any International aspect In par ticular. It was a short messare and more than half of It waa devoted to domestic affaire. At the last moment, Preeldent Wilson yle'ded to the wishes of hla I pnysician ana aia not Btiempi n f to the capltol and deliver tr- mes aage In person before a Joint ses sion of both houaee. Inataad, a few mlnutee before noon the meeeaae was transmitted to each house eeparately and there was read to the membera. 

RECOMMENDATIONS. Preeldent Wilson's concrete rec ommendations to congress were: Revision of the tax laws with simplification of the Income and profits taxes. Independence for the Phllllplnes. A loan to Armenia. Economy In government appro priations and expenditures and creation of "workable budget sys tem." Cold storage and other laws af fecting the cost of living, and the federal licensing of corporation as recommended In previous tries eagea. Rehabilitating and training of disabled soldiers and sailors. The preeldent did not indorse a bonus. As to Treaty Fight. Nowhere did the president reter to he league of nations or the peace treaty tight, except perhaps, by Infer ence In his opening when he quoted Abraham Lincoln's "It us have faith that right makes miKht, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as wo understand It." At its closo the president wrote a paragraph which might he regarded as a valedictory saying "1 have not so miieff falcrHfBre you a series of recommendations" as sought to titter a conreaalon of faith, of the faith, of which I was tired and which It Is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting days. I believe this to iio the taith of America, the faith of the future, and of all the victories which national action in the days to coino, whether In America or elsewhere. ' "Democracy" he said. Is being put upon its final test. "The old world, said he, "Is Just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle or democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as asserted In the name but without the authority and sanction of the multitude. This Is the time of all others when democracy should prove Its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the mani fest restlny of the United States to lead In the attempt to make this spirit prevail. Two ways "in which the United States can assist to accomplish tins great object" were outlined by the president. They were: "First, bv ottering the example with in her own borders of the will and power of democracy to make and en lorco laws which are unquestionably lust, and which are equal in their ad ministration. Second, by standing tor right and Justice as towards individual nations." "The Unltel States," said the pres ident, "cannot reiuse mis iw plon without putting the stigma of re jection upon the great and devoted men who brought its government Into existence.", Quoted From Lincoln. President Wilson began his message with a quotation from Lincoln: Let us have faith that right makes might and In that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it. The sim ple faith expressed in Lincoln s words formed the gist of the entire document. There was no reference to the tumultuous-closing days of his own administra tion, nor the incoming republican ad ministration on March 4. This one phrase, the president sa.o. marks out America s duly in oom w ,,,! rinmentir affairs : by thl this faith alone, he said, can the world be lifted out of its present state of con frsion and despair.' The president, himself, summed up his message In its final para graph: "I have not so much laid before you a series of recommendations." he said, "as I have sought tc ut ter a confession of faith, of the faith In which I waa bred, and which It Is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting days. I believe this to be the faith of America, the faith of the future, and of all the victories which await national action In days to come, whether In America or elsewhere. The first paragraph of the presiden tial message was devoted to expres sions of his faith and the urging upon ennrress Its dutv to make America In deed the triumphal forces for right and justice.

The guiding spirit of America nt home and abroad should be Lincoln's immortal sentence: "Let us have faith that right makes might and In that faith let us dare to do our duty as we un derstand It." , The United States cannot re fuse the role of champion of right and Justice. without putting the atigma of rejection on the great men who founded the republic.

"A sentence Immortal because It em bodies In a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential faith of the na. lion, the faith In which It was con ceived and the faith In which It has grown to glory nnd power, With that faith and the birth of a nation founded upon it came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail tlnoughout the affairs of mankind, an order In which reason nnd tight would take preceded la of covetousness and force, and I believe that I express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful American wnen i say mm no . lence marks for us In the plainest man ner the part we should play ause m the arrangement of our domestic affairs and in our exercise of Influence m;; the affairs of the world.

Democracy at Final Test. "ri.i ia ih mission upon which de mocracy came Into the world. Democ racy is an assertion of the right of the individual to live and to be treated Justly as ngalnst any attempt on the part of any combination of Individuals to make laws which will overburden him or which will destroy nts eouainy among his fellows In the matter of right or privilege, and 1 think we all realise that the day has come when democracy Is being put upon us unu test. The old world Is Just now suf fering from a wanton rejection or ine principle of democracy ami m Hon of the principle of autocracy as aaserteil In the name but without the authority and sanction of the multi tude.

I reluctantly vetoed the budget bill passed by the last ses sion of the congress because of a con slitutlonal objection. The house of representatives subsequently modified ihe bill In order to meet this objection. In the revised form I believe thai the lull, coupled With action already taken bv the congress to revise Its rules and procedure, furnished the foundations tor an effective national budget sys tem. I earnestly hope, therefore, that one of the (list steps taken by tiu present session of the congress will be to pass the budget bill.

COTTON ACREAGE IN HALF Head New Orleans Exchange Predicts 1921 Crop of Six Million Bales. REDUCTION EMPHASIZED Memphis. Pec 7 (A. PI A reduc tion of at least 50 per cent. In the cot ton acienge In INI end a crop of not more than 0.000. 000 bales was predicted by W 11 Thompson, former president of the New Orleans Cotton exchange. In an address toilay before the cotton conference here, called to Inaugurate a campaign for a material cotton acreage reduction and crop diversifi cation during the coming planting sea son. "The south Is determined to reduce the cotton acreage In 1021 to al least onehalf of thai of last cat." pot, Thompson said, "This will mean that the Batntngj crop will be reduce, I lo (i.non nno imies or lees The convention hero is oatjed for the purpose of sotld1 tying this determination and serving notion on the world that the cotton oroduclni south Will no longer permit Its chief agricultural asset to be llgltfhtered and lis producers Impov erished by any comhjnation of circum stances or Interests whatsoever!" After niilllning the course of the market In recent months, Col Thomp son declared the reduction movement was made nopOSSSry by "Hie appii'llng decline In prices, due, we are told bv apologists, to (lie ruthless deflation campaign to over-production." Washington Crltlclied. "In spite of the fact that In the spring the farmers were urged slid eneoiirsged by tlnsnchil atitliosftles at Washington to produce all the cotton nnsslh'e." Col Thompson continued, "we are, after the price has declined to flgures which represent less Hum one-half actual cost of production, told thai we have Produced too much and must slsnd the coiiserpiences of such over prodiietl .n."
