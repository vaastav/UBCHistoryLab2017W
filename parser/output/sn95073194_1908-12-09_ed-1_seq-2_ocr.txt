Judge M. B. Reese will bear the title of chief justice of the supreme court from now until a successor is chosen, who will take his place in. 1914. This was announced the past week, after a meeting of the new aug-: mented court. Judge Barnes has held the title aa ranking member of the court. The change was made in accordance with the interpretation which the judges placed upon the amendment providing for the enlarged court. This provides for the election of three judges in 1909. They will fill the": places made vacant by expiration of, the terms of Judges Barnes, Sullivan: and Fawcett In 1911 three will be elected to fill the places at the expira tion of the terms of Judge Letton.. Root and Rose. In 1913 one judge is,' to be, elected to fill the place of Judge; Reese. The constitution in providing" for the elections makes the judge to' be elected in 1913 and each six years: thereafter chief justice. It also pro-' vldes that the judge whose term ex pires at that time shall be chief justice until then. That the four remaining members; of the old commission will continue to serve the state am draw salaries for a time yet is indicated from the fact that at the first sitting of the court seven cases were assigned to the commission for argument. The court assigned thirteen cases for ar gument before itself. Judge Sullivan was not present when the court met and. assigned cases. He arrived later and qualified immediately, sitting with the court later to hear argument. Rose, Root- and Fawcett were already in Lincoln. Judge Sullivan has since, tendered his resignation and the same has been ac cepted. The commissioners whose places will cease to exist sometime between now and the first of April are E. R. Duffie, E. C. Calkins, A. C. Epperson, and E. E. Good. The commission will; probably be continued until after the cases which are in the hands of these four members have been decided. It' is not likely, however, that they will' hear any further cases after the' present sitting. t Sullivan's Withdrawal Regretted. Genuine and general regret has been expressed on all sides at the de- termination of Judge Sullivan to re-, linquish the place on the supreme bench offered him by Governor Shel-' rinn. At. the same timA it is freelv iiil.i mittcd. that Judge Sullivan could not! Jn justice to himself, have done other than he did. There seems to have been a pretty general feeling, however, that Judge Sullivan's re-election to the bench next year, had he cared to enter the race, would have been without ques tion. A dozen prominent republicans, including several state officers, have said that they believed no man in the state better qualified for the place than Judge Sullivan and that they would be glad of the opportunity to vote for him. There is some criticism of Gov. Sheldon for not making Judge Sulli van one of the three-year appointees. It Is possible that, had this been done, the resignation would not have been tendered. More Room Needed. State Land Commissioner H. M. Eaton will recommend in his annual report that, owing to the crowded con dition of the state capitol building, the legislature must either abolish seme of the new departments it has created or fit up the basement for office rooms, or move the state library and the department of justice to the proposed historical building across the street from tne capitol grounds. The latter can be done if the legislature makes an appropriation for a histori cal building large enbugh to accommo date both the society and the depart ment which it is proposed to house In the building. Insurance Company Withdraws. The Mutual Surety company of New York has notified Insurance Deputy Pierce that it has withdrawn from the state and has so informed its agents. The company was admitted -o do business in Nebraska in 190fi and has been doing business here since. While no explanation of its withdraw al was given, it is supposed by the insurance department that its Nebras ka business did not justify it taking out a license for the coming j'ear. Maupin to Change Tactics. Will M. Maupin. who has been chos en labor commissioner by Governor Elect Shallenberger, will adopt a few different ideas about the management of tne bureau.
