ROMANCE ENDS FOR WILHELMINA Consort Eats Too Much Drinks Too Much and Hunts. Holland Queen Binds Wounr of a Man Her Hus . band Injured. LONDON, Dec. 6.— A dispatch to the Evening News from The Hague, published to-day, says: "Peace reigns again at the palace, and the happiest man in Holland is Major Van Tets, who was wounded in defense of Queen W'ilhelmina by Prince Henry, or, as all Dutchman now con temptuously call him 'the German.' '•Van Tets is one of the ten noble youths who formed the body guard of the smiling young Queen when she was mar ried in February, and who have been since at their royal mistress' beck and call on every occasion. They pride themselves on iheir servitude, and in this matter-of-fact twentieth century their chivalrous devo tion to Queen Wiihelmina is a pretty thing to see. "It is whispered that every man of the ten handsome youths who surround her Majesty's carriage when she drives abroad, skate with her when she skates, ride with her when she riaes end dance attendance on her generally, has been at one time or another over head and ears in iove with the dainty little lady in whom -tioiiaiid's hopes are centered. ■'Official contradictions notwithstanding, nobody at The Hague doubts for a mo ment that the Queen and her consort have been at loggerheads practically since the wedding, .frince Henry is an unpleasant person. He eats too much, drinks too ireely, and hunting occupies him far more than his wife. Wiihelmina, on her side, is jjot a woman to allow herself to be neg lected with impunity. It is said that she stanched Van rets' wound with her own hands and insisted on her husband beg ging pardon of the Jonkherr as well as of herself, before she would forgive him. All the romance of the marriage of Wilhel xnina and the man she herself chose has disappeared." I.OXDOX.

MEXICO CITY, Dec. 6.— The session to day of the Pan-American conference was taken up with a discussion of Chile's proposition » regarding the practice of learned professions, chiefly whether, even if accepted, the convention would be of any practical value. These doubts were strengthened by the explanations of C. M. Pepper of the United States delegation to the effect that in his country" this mat ter came under State legislation, over which the Federal authorities had no con trol. Gil Fortoul of Venezuela asked Pepper whether a professional diploma issued in one of the States of the United States was recognized in the others. Pepper re plied that each State made its own terms and that there was no obligation on the part of any of them to recognize diplomas issued in another. Gil Fortoul said that that was really very serious and he did not see the use of going any further. The question was whether the delega tions were in favor of the proposed con vention in a general way. This being put to a vote the convention in general was accepted by seventeen votes. Bolivia vot i-g adversely and Uruguay's representa tive beins absent. John Barrett of the United States dele gation presented a letter from E. S.

The tire was discovered about 4:40 this morning by the grocery clerk, Morris Fizis. He immediately gave the alarm, but the Hames spreaa so rapidly that. the occupants of the upper story were shut off trom the stairway. Klee and his wife realized that the only way to save the chllaren was to drop them from the win dow, a distance of about twenty feet. One by one the children were brought to the front window and dropped to -the ground by the father. All of them, were more or less seriously injured, but all es caped death from the flames except Mary. By* the time Harry, the baby, was reached, the father was almost exnaiisted and the little one's face and feet and hands were blistered and burned. He was snatched from the flames just in time and it is thought he will survive. After rescuing his baby, the father looked around for his wife and being un able to locate her, he became almost dis tracted. It seems that while the father was rescuing the youngest and most helpless child his wife was making an attempt to save the life of Mary, and In doing so gave up her own life. < The House was destroyed. The charred I remains of the mother and daughter were THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY,^ DECEMBER 7, 1901. : ; AJVEBTISEMENTS.
