Washington, Dec 4- The president's message to congress was not so long- as expected. The Hawaiian, matter was -not extensively referred to, advices "being awaited. The views o the presi--dent on foreign and domestic affairs arc as follows: Message to the congress or the United States: The constitutional duty which requires the Xrcsilcnt from time to Uato to give to the con gress information or the state ot the union and recommend to their consideration such meas ures as he shall Judge necessary and expedient, Ss fittingly entered upon by comnicmilng to the xmgrcss a careful examination of (he detailed statement and ireU supported recommenda sloes contained in thi reports of th beads of departments who are chfeflr charged with the executive work of the government. In nn ef fort to abridge this communication as much -a Is consistent with Its pappose, I shall supplement a brief reference to ths contents of these departmental reports by Oie mention of each executive business and.

This treaty I with Gzsm for examination and dispatched Hon. Jn-n A Blount, cf Georgta, to Honolulu as a special commission to make an Impartial in-cslig-Uon of the circumstances attending the fcjrgcnf govemmectasBdof alithe rnndltinsg bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination Mr. Blount submitted to mo his report showing beyond all question that the constitutional government 6f Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representatives to that g vernmentand through the intimidation caused by the pres ence of an armed naval force of the United Scates which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed It seemed to me the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and lo restore as far as prac ticable the status existing at tho time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accom pushing this result within the constitutloml limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities grow ing out of any change or conditlbns, brought about our unjustifiable lntcrferencc our present minister at Honolulu his received appropriate instructions to that end. Thus ar no information of the accomplishment or anv dennitc result ha3 been received from htm Additional advices are soon expecttd. When received they will promptly be sent to congress together with all other information at hand, accompinled bv a special executive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to com plete under-Unding or the case, and presenting a history of all miterlal, events leading up to the present situation. The Treasury.

One hundred and nineteen national binks were orginizid during the year ending October 31, 183, with a capital of ll,itO,'W, fortv-six went into toluntiry liquidation und 13 sus pcniid.

Tha net In crease In the circulation ot these binks during the year was 31NJ5.8"2, The recent repeal ot the protlsion of taw requiring the purchase ot silver bullion by the lovernmcnt as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency af filrs I do i.ot doubt that tho ul tmate result ot this action will be most salutary ani tar reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is lmpos siblc to Know at this time precisely what condi tions will be brought about by the change, or what, it any, supplementary legislation may in the light ot such conditions, appear to be es sential or expedl nt Of course, after the re cent financial perturbation tlm is necessarv for the re establishment of business confidence. When, however, through this restored conll d nee, the money which has been trightoned into hoarding laces is returned to trade and enterprise, a survc. of the situation will probably disclcs? a safe path leading to a permanently- sound currency abundantly sumclent to meet every requirement of ou In creasing population ani business. In the pur suit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporar ex pedients, determined to bo contented with nothing less than a lasting and com prehensive financial plan In theso cir cumstances I am coninccd that a reasonable delay In dealing with the su ject, instead of being injurious, will increase the probability of wise action I desire to carncstlv suggest the wisdom cf amending the existlnT statutes in r gard to the issuance ot government bonds. The authority now esledinthe secretary of the trct-urr to issue bonds is not as clear as it should be an! the bonds lUthorizeJ are disad vantageous to the gov rnm n both as to the time ot maturl and rate of interest. The superintendent of imm'gration through the secretary of tho treasury report- that dur ing the 1 st fiscal year there arrived at our ports 441,791 immignnts. Of these 1.063 were not permitted to land ucder tbe limitations of tbe law and 577 were i cturned to tho couutries frcm which they came by reas n ot their having become public cnarge . The total arrivals were Ill,v34 less than for the previous year. Department of Justice. Tbe reporter the aitorner-gcneral contains the usual summary o! the aSalrs and proceed ings ot the department of Justice for tho past year, together with certain recommendations as to needed legislation on various subjects. I cannot too heartily indorse tbe proposition that the fee svstem as applicable to the com pensation of United Stafs attorney, marshals. clerks ot federal courts and United States com missioners should be abolished with as little delay as possible It is clearly in the interest of the communif that the business of the courts both civil and criminal shall be as small and as inexpensively conducted as the ends of justice will allow. The s stem is, therefore, thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation ot court cru cial s depend upon the volume of such business and thus create a conflict between a proper ex ecution of the law and private giin, which can not fail to be dangerous to the rights and free dom of the citizen an an irresistible tempta tion to the unjustified expenditure of public funds. U in addition to this reform another was inaugu-ated which would give to United States commissioners the final disposition of petty offenses within the grade of m sdemean ors, especially tho-e coming under the Internal revenue laws, a great advance would be made toward a more decent administration ot the crimln 1 law. In my first message to congress dated Decern ber8,le85,Istrongly recommended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the evils of the present system. Since that time the .crim inal business of the federal courts ani the ex panse attending it have enormously increased. The number of criminal prosecutions pending in the circuit and district courts of the United States on the 1st day ot July, liS5. was 3,8 8, or which 1,884 were for violations of the internal revenue laws, while the number or such prose cutions pending on the 1st dav of July, 1833, was 9,500 in which 4,200 were for violations or the Internal revenue laws The expense of the United States courts exclusive of judges salar ies for the year ending July 1, le8, was $2,874, 733.11 and lor the year ending July. 1893, $1,523, 676.87. It is, therefore, apparent that the reasons given in 1885 for n change tn the manner of enforcing the federal criminal l&ws have gained cogenev and strength by lapse of timo. I also heartily join the attorney-gen ral In recommending legislation fixing decrees ot murder within-federal jurisdiction, as has been done In many ot th st ites, authorizing writ ot error on behalf of tho government In cases where final judgment is r nde ed against tho sufficiency of an Indictment or aga nst tbe government on any other question arising bo fa e actual trial, limiting tho right of review in case of felony p nishable only by flno and im prisonment to the circuit court of appeals, and making speedy p o islon for th9 construction of such prison and reformatories as may be necessary for tho confinement of United States convicts. Post OOlce Department. The report of the po3tmaster-general con tains a do tailed statement of the operations ot the post office department during the last fis cal tear and much information touching this important branch of the public service. The business ot tho mails lndlcite with absolute certatnt? the condition ot the business of the country, and depressions In financial affairs In evitably and quickly reduces the postil reve nues. There foro a larger discrepancy than usual between tho post office receipts and ex penditures Is tbe expected and unavoidable re sult of th.9 depressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the timo coicredbythe postmaster-general's report. At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessor that tho deficiency on tho 30th div of June, 1833, would be but a little over $I,5K),0W. It amounted, however, to more than $000,0X). At the same time and under the influence ot line anticipa tion estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June 3,', 18)1, which exhibited a surplus of rovenue over expenditures of SJ72, 245.71, but now in view of tho actual receipts and expenditures during that part of tho cur rent fiscal year already expired tho present postmaster general est ma es that at Its close Instead of a surplus there will be a deficiency of ncarh 

$1.00J.UOJ. The post office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $7i.S.h5,3AI0 and Its expenditures to ISI 074,114 90 This post offico deficiency would disappear or be Immensely decreised If less matter were carried f reo through the mills, an Item of which is upward of three hundred tons of seeds and grain from tho agricultural depirimcnt Tho total number of post unices In tho United States on tho 3)lhdav or June, 1-93, was u-,IJI. an Increase or 1,284 otcr the preceding year, and cr these 3, 0) were presidential, an increase in that class ot 2)4 over tho preceding fortv-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already csNtlng. making a total of 0)3, and ten cities and towns provided with freo delhery on June 3), 1893, ninety-three other cities and towns are now entitled to this servico under the law, but It has not been accorded them on account of In sufficient funds to meet the expense of its es tablishment. I am decidedly of tho opinion that the provisions of the present law permits as general introduction of this feature of mall sen Ito as is necessary and justifiable, and that It ought not to be extended to smaller com munlties than ar now designated. The expense ot free delivery for the fiscal rear ending June 30, 1891, will be more than !U, iW.ojOuml under the administration now existing th-re must bo a constant Increase In the Item of expenditures. There were 0,4 1 ad ditions to the domestic money order offices during the last fiscal tear, being tho largest in crease in an, j ear since the inauguration ot the system. The total number of these offices at the close ot the icar was 18,131. Thero were 1 1,39,735 money orders issued from theso of fices, being nn Increase oier the p'eceding year of 1,243,293. and the value of these orders amounted to 127, 76,133.0 an Increase of Jf7, 503,012 58. Thero were also Issued during the year postal notes amounting to $12.903, 170.7.1 During thi vear 19 international mon or der offices were addei to thoso a readv pro vided, making a to nl of 2.417 In operation on June .0, 1833. The number of Intprnitlonal mo ey ordors Issued during the vear was l,"55, 993, an increase oter tho precdlng year of 72, 525. ani the value was $10,341 8 r7 80, an increase of $1,2:1.30431. The number of orders paid wa ,0,9ir. an increase over the preceedlng jcar of 13,503, and their value was $i28l.J75, an In crease f $9LJ9I83 Tram the roreg ing state ments it appears that the total lsuc or money ord rs and io!tal n ites far tho car amoun cd to$l5e,21?2L Th c number of letters and packiges mailed duringthe jear for special delhery was 3,373, 693. an increase over the preceding year of nearlv 22 per cent The special delivery stimp used upon these letters and packages amounted to 3.h,5S9 Ui and the messetin r' fees pii 1 for their delivery amounted to S2.G.59 .71, leaving a profit to the government of V 9 9.0 59 The rail way mall service not onlv adds to tin prompt ness of mail delivery at all onUes, but it Is tho especial instrumentality which puts thcsaialler and way plices in the service on an equility in that regard with tho larger and terminal offices. This branch of tho postal service his. there fore, received much attention from the post master general, and though it Is gratifying to know th it it is in a condition ot hlgii efficiency and great usefulness. I am led to agreo with the postmaster-general that there Is room for its further Improvement. There are now con nected with the post olllce establishment 2J.32I employes who are In the classified service, and the head of this great depirticnt gives con clusive evidence of the value, of civil service reform when, after an experience that renders his judgment absolutely reliable, he expresses the opinion that without th- benefit of this system It would be impossible to conduct tho vast business intrusted to him. Tho Interior Department. The secretary of tho Interior h is the super vision of so miny Important subjects that his reports are of special value and Interest. On the 30 h d ly of June, 1833, thero wero on the pension rolls 930.012 names, an increase of 83 -91 over tho number on tbe rolls June SO, 1S9 1 Of these thero were seventeen widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, the sur vivors of the war of 1812. .-,4B widow of soldiers of that over, 21.518 survivors and widows ot the Mexican war. 3,Si2 s jrvlvors and widows of In dian wars 281 army nurses and 478I surviv ors and widows and children ot deceased sol diers and sallo a of the war ot the rebellion. The latter ni-mbcr represents thoso pensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from army and navv service Tho number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1S33. - ho are pensioned under tho act of Juno 27, 1890, which allows pensions on ac count of death and disability not chargablo to armv service was 4i9,155 "Ihe number added to the rolls during the years was 123,J34 and tho number dropped was 3169'. The first payments on pensions allowed during the year amounted to 33,7tJ,549 93. This includes arrears on the accumulation be tween the time from which the allowance of present dates and the lime ot actually granting the certificates, although the law nt 189) per mits pensions for disability not related to mili tary service, yet as a requisite to Its benefits a disability must exist incapacitating applicants "from the performance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support." Execution of this law In its early stages does not seem to have been in accord with its true inten ion. but toward the close ot the last ad ministration an authoritative construction was given to tbe statute and xince that time this construction has been followed. T is had the effect ot limiting tho operation of the law to its intended purposes. The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means ot wholesale and gigantic frauds, the commissioner suspended payments upon a number ot pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete examination, giving notice to the pensioners, in order that they might have an opportunity to es ablish. if possible, the justice of their claims notwithstanding apparent invalidity. This, I understand, is the practice which has for a long t me preva led in the pension bureau, but alter entering upon thise recent investiga tions the commissioner modified this rule so as not to allov. until after a complete examina tion, interference with the pavment ot a pen-Ion not altog ther void, but which merely had bjen fixed at a rate higher than that au thorized b 7 liw. I am unable to understand why f racds in tne pension office should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. very name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon tho kindly sentiment in which pen slons have their origin. Ever fraudu lent pensioner has become a bad citizen affidavits to support of a pension havo made perjury more ommen, and false and undeserv ing pensions rob the people not only of their money but of the patriotic sentiment which the survivors of a war fought for t.e p eserva- tlon of the union ought to inspire. Tnousands of neighborhoods have their well ttnon fraudu lent pensioners, and recent developments by the bureau establish appalling conspiracies to establish pension frauds. By no means the least wrong done Is to brave and deserving pensioners, wh ought not to be conuemnea to such associations. Those who attempt, in the line of duty, to rectify these misdoings should not be accused of enmity or Indifference to the claims of honest veterans. Tbe sum expended on account of pensions, for the year end Ing June 30, if 91, was $150,740,437.14. The commission estimates that $165,000,0)0 will be required to pay pensions during the year ending Juno 33,M894. O r Indians number about 248.030. Most of them are located on 161 reser utlons containing 80,110,521 acres f land. About HO.OOOof these Indians have to a large degree adopted cl viuzeu customs Lands in severalty hav been all tied to many if them. Such allotments have been made to 10.000 Individuals during the ast fiscal year, embracing about l,()0,ouo acres. The number of Indian government schools open during the year was 195. an lno ease ot 12 over the preceding year. Of this total ii J were on reservations, of which 73 were boarding schools and C7 were day schools. Twenty boarding schools and five day schools supported by the government were no located on reservations. The total number of Indian children enrolled during tho year as attendants of all schools was 21.133. an increase of 1.231 over the enrollment for the previous year. I am sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching must bo important fac tors in any effort to sive the I dlan and lead him o civilization. I believe, too. that the re linquishment of tribal relations and tho holding of land In severalty may. in favorablo condi tions, aid this consummition It seems to me, however, that allotments or land In soveralty ought to be made with great care and circum spection. , The appropriations on account of the Indian bureau lor the year ending June 3'. lr9. amount to $795,19Si9) a decrease as compared with the year preceding it of $187,111 9 . The vast area of land which but a short time ag- constituted the public domain is rapidly falling Into private hands It is certain that in the transfer the beneficent intention of the government to supply from its domain homes to the Industrious and worthy homo seekers Is often frustrated. Though the speculator who stands with extortionate purpose between the land office and those who, with their families, are Invited by tho government to settle on the public lands. Is a despicable character who ought not to bo tolerated, yet It is dlffl.ult to thwart his scheme The recent opening to settlemen of tho lands in tho Cherokee outlet, embracing an area of 0,500,0 0 acres, notwithstanding the utmostcaro tn framing the regulations governlni the selec tion of locations and notwithstanding the pres ence of United states troops, furnished an ex hibition, though, perhaps in a modified degree, of the mad scramble, the violence and thi fraudulent occupation which hive accompanied previous openings of public lands. I concur with th secretary in the belief that these out rageous Incidents cinnot be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on the subj-ct, and I hope tho recommend vtions In that direc tion will bo favorably considered. Department or Agriculture. The report of the secretary of agriculture will be round exceedingly Interesting, especial ly to that largo part or or our citizens Inti mately concerned in agricultural occupations. On the 9th day of March.1591. there were upon its piv rolls 2,4 W employes. This number has been reduced to l,K0 persons In v lew of a depicted public treisury and tho imperative demand of tho people for the economy in tho adminis tration or their government, the secretary has entered upon the task ot rationally reducing ex penditures bv eliminating from tbe pay rolls nil person"-!! not needed for nn efficient con duct of the affairs of tho department During the first quarter of tho present year th" ex penses of tho department aggregated 1315,87170 against $102,912.42 for the corresponding period of the fiscal year ended June 31, 193. The sec retary makes apparent his Intention of continu ing this rite of reduction by submitting esti mates for the next fiscal year less by t99l,3&) than those for tho present vear. Among the heads of divisions In this depart ment the changes havo been exceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring from death and resignations have been tilled b tho promotion of assistants in the same divisions. Theso pro motions of experienced and faithful assistants have not only been in the interest of efficient work, but have suggested to thoso in tho do parment who look for retention and promotion that merit and devotion to duty are their best reliance. The amount appropriated for tho bu reau of animal inJustry for tho current fiscal j ear Is $85i,UM. tho estimate for the ensuing jeiris$7d ,0)0 Tho rcgulitions of 189! concerning Texas fever have been enforced during the last year, and iho large stock j ards of the country have been Kept free from Infection Occasional 1 -cal outbreaks havo been largely such as could havcb en effectually guarded against by the owners of the affected cattle. While cont iglous pcuro pneumonia in cattle has been crad'eated animal tuberculosis, a dis ease wldespreid and more dangerous to human life thin plcuro-pncumonia. Is still 'prevalent. Investigations havo been ma Ic during tbe past year as to t e means of its communication a d tho method ot its correct diagnosis. Much pr.gres- has been raide in this direction by the studies of the div ision ot animal pathol ogy, but work ought to be extended in co operation with local authorities, until the dan ger to human life arising from this cause Is re duccd to a minimum. The number of anlmils arriving from Canada during the year and inspected by bureau officer was 4tU092, and the number from trans Atlantic countries was 1,297. No contagious diseases were found among the imported animals. '1 ho total number or inspections of cattle for ex port during the past fiscal ear was 011.54 . Tho exports show a falling off of about 24 per cent, from the preceding voir, tho decrease occurring entirely In the lost half or the vear This suggests that the falling oft may have been largely due to an Increase in tbe price of Amer ican export cattle Burin: the year ended Juno 30, V9 exports of inspected pork aggre gated 2.1,077.410 pounds ns against 3.152,74 pounds for Ihe preceding year. The falling off In this export is not confined, however, lo in spected pork, the total quantity exported for 1832 being OH49I010 pounds, while In 1891 it was only -27,3J&i9 pounds. I join the secretary in recommending that hcreifter each applicant for the position of In spector or assistant Inspector tn the bureau of animal Industry be required as a condition pre cedent to his appointment to exhibit to the United States civil service commissioner his diploma from an established regular and repu table veterinary college, and that this bo sup plemented by such an examination in veterin ary science as tho comm!sion may prescribe. The exports ot agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal vear ended June 33, 1892, attained tho enormous figure or8W,o 0.0 K) In round numbers, being 7o.7 per ceht. ot our total exports. In the last flscil year t is aggregate was greatly reduced, but, nev rt el ss, reached $ul5 OJ.OiX), being 7a. I per cent, or all American commodities exported A review ot our agri cultural exports ith special refere ce to tbelr res luation will show that in almost every line the United Kingdi m of Great Britain and Ire land arsorbs b far the largest proportion Or cattle th9 total exports aTgrcgated In value ror the fiscal vear ended June 30, 19 1, $M,Oii,0) oi which Great Britain took considerably over $2 

O'.OOD. Or beer products of all kinds our total exports were $3,')J0.0)t ot which Great Britain tool: $' 1,0 ',000 Of pork products the total exports were $?', 030, 00, of which Great Britain took $3.)0 , boa. In breadstuffs, cotton and minor products, like proportions sent to the same destination are shawn. The work of the statistical division of the department of agriculture deals with all thit relates to the economics of farming. The main purpose of its monthly reports are to keep tho farmers informed as fully as possible of all matters having anv influence upon the world's markets In which their products found sale. Its publications relate espe. tally to the commercial side of farming. It is therefore of profound importance and vital concern to the farmers of the United States who, represont nearly one-ha f of our population, and also of direct interest to the whole country, that the work of this division be efficiently performed and that the informa tion it has gathered be promptly diffused. It Is a matter for congratulation to know that the secretary will not spare any effor to make this part of his work thoroughly useful. In the vear 1839 the congress appropriated $1,IC0 to be taken rrom tbe pvtent office funds for the purpose of collecting and dis tributing rare and 1 r proved variet es of seeds and Tor prosecuting agri cultural invest'gatlons and procuring agri cultural statist ics.and from this small beginning the seed division or the department or agricult ure has grown to Its present unwieldy and un justifiably extravagant proportions. During the last fiscal year tho cost or seeds purchased was $60,518 6L The remainder or an appropriation ot $1 iiKX) was expended In put ting them up and distributing them. It sure y never could have en teed t e minds of those who first sanctioned appropria tions of public money for the pur chase ot new and improved varieties of seeds for distribution that from this would grow large appropriations for the purchase and distribution by members of congress of or dinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings whl hare com mon in all the states and territories and every where easily obtainable at low prices In each state and territory an agricultural experiment station has been established. These stations. by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties, of seeds; ana yet una ucusenm- inate and wasteful distribution by legislation and legislators contlnues,answer!ng no purpose unless It be to remind constituents that their representatives ore willing to remember them with gratuitous seeds at public cost Under the sanction ot existing legislation there was sent out trom the agricultural de partment during the last fiscal vcar enough ot cabbage seed to plant 19,0) acres ot land, a sufficient quantity of beans to plant 4,000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2,500 acres, sweet corn enough to plant 7.8J0 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,025 acres with vines and enough muskmelon and watcmelon seeds to plant 2,675 acres The total quantity ot flower andvcgctablo seeds thus distributed was contained in more than nine million packages and they were sufficient if planted to cover E9 59J acres ot land. In view of these facts this enormous expendi ture without legitimate returns of benefit ought to be abolished. Anticipating a com munication so manifestly in tho 'interest of gool lcglslatl n more than $100,000 has been stricken from tho estimate made to cover this obje.-t for tho year ending Juno 33, 1835, and the secretary recommends that the remaining $3.1.003 of estimate be confined strictly to the purchase of new and improved larletles of seed and that theso be distributed through ex periment stations Thus the seed will be Ic3tei and after tho test has been completed by the esper'm?nt station the propagation of Ihe useful varieties and tho rejection of the valueless may safely be left to the common sense of the people War Department. The secretary of war reports that tho strength of the army on tho .wth day of Sep tember last was 2-I.773 enlisted men und2.lt 4 officers. The total expenditures of the depart ment for the year ending Juno 3 . 1833. amount ing to J51.9H07S.83. Otthlssum 11,992. 81 9i was for salaries and contingent cvoenses $3,3"". 83.31 for tho support of the military establish ment. $t,u77,033.H for miscellaneous objects ani $23.518.031 41 for publto work. This latter sum lncluds 415,293,970.40 for river and harbor improvements and 43.2)6,111 23 for fortifica tions and other works of defense. The total enrollment of tho militia of tho sev eral states was, on the list of October of the current year, 1 11 597 officers and enlisted men The officers of tho arm detailed for the In spection and instruction or this reserve of our military force report thatvincreased interest and marked progress aro apparent In iho dis cipline and efficiency of the organization Neither Indlin outbr aks or domestic vio lence have called the army Into service during the year, and tho only active military duty re quired ot It has been in tho depirtment of Texas, where violations ot tho neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with by the troops, elicit ing tho warm approval of tlw civil and mill tar authorities of both countries Tho operation of wise laws and the influence of civilization constantly tending" to relieve the country from the dangers of Indian hostilities, together with tho increasing ability ot tho suites throuzh the efficiency of thenitionil guard organlzitlon to protect their citizens from domestic violence, lead to tho suggestion that tbe time is fast approaching when there should be a reorganlzitlnn of our army on the lines of tbe present necessities of the co antrv. This change contemplates neither Increase in number nor added expense, but a redistribution ot the force and an encouragement of measures tcndln? to greater efficiency among the men and improvement of the(servlca After much preliminary work and examina tion in accordance with the requirements ot th- law, tho board appointed to select a m igazlne rifle of modern type with orders to replace the obsolete Springfield rifle of theinfintry serv ice, completed its labors during the last year and tbe work of manufacturing is now in prog ress at th national armory at Spring'leld. It is confidently expected thit by tho end of the current year our inf ntrv wl'l be supplied with a weapon equal to that of the most progressive armies ot the world Tho work ot tho projected Chickamiuga and Chattanooga national military park has been prosecuted with zeal and judgment The reports of tho mlllt irv acaicmv at West Point and the special schools for special in struction of officers show marked advance in the education ot the armv and a commendable ambition among Its o fleers to excel in the military profession and to fit themselves for the highest sen ice to the country. Tho Nuvy. The report of tho stcretar of the mvy con tains a history of the operations of his depart ment during the past year and exhibits a most grillfving condition of the personnel of our navw. He presents a satisfactory account to congress which has been made In the construc tion of vessels and mnkos :i number of recom mendations which Is e peciallr Invited. Uurieg the past six months tho demands for arming vwcls have been many and urgent 'lhere hive been revolutions calling for vessels to proteot American interests in Nicaragua, Guatemata, Cota Rica. Honduras, Argentine and Brazil, while tho condition of affairs in Honolulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships With all these calls upon our navy It became necessary In order lo make up a sufficient fleet, to patrol the Behrlng sea under tha modus Vivendi agreed upon with Great Britain to detail to that service one ves sel from the fish commission and three from tho 'cvenuo marina Progress In tho construction of now vessels has not been as rapid as was anticipated. There havo ben delays in tbe completion of unarm ored vessels, but for the roost part they have been such as was constantly occurring even in countries hiving the largest experience In naval ship building. Tho most serious delays, how ever, hive been in tho work upon armored ships. The troublo has been tho failure of con tractors to deliver a rmor as agreed. The diffi culties seora now. however, to havo been all overcome and armir Is being delivered with satisfactory promptness Tho method of cmp.oylng mechanicil labor at navy cards tbraugh boards of labor, an . making efficiency the sole test by which labor era are employed and continued. Is producing tho best results, and the secretary Is earnestly devoting himself to Its development Attention is invited to ths statements of his report in re gard to workings o tbe system The Civil Service. The continued intelligent execution of the civil service law and thi Increasing npprovil by ihe people of its operation are most quilifying. Tne recent extension of Its limitations und regula tions to the employes at free delivery post offi'cs which his been honestly and promptly accomplsheJ by the commission, with the hearty co-operation or the pos'master-gcneral. Is an immensely important advance in the use fulness of hi system. I am. If possible, more thin ever convinced of the Incalculable benefits conferred by tho civil service law, not only in its cfli ct uron the public service, but also what is ev en more important in Its effect In elevating tbe tone of political life generally. The law embodying civil service reform found its way to our statute book more from fear ot the popular sentiment existing in its fa vor than from any love for the reform Itself on tho part of legislators, and it has lived and grown and flourished in spite ot the covert as well as open hostility ot spoilsmen and notwithstanding the querulous impracticability of m ny self-constituted guardians. B ncith all th3 va arlcs an sublimated theories which re attracted to it there underlies this reform a sturdr. com mon sense principle not only suited sto this mundane sphere, but whose application our people are more and more recognizing to be ab solutely essential to thi mst successful opera tions of their government, if not to lis per petuity It seems tome to be entirely Inconsistent with the charac.er or this reform as well as 'ith its best enforcement, to oblige the com mission to rely for clerical assistance upon clerks detailed fro p othc departments. There ought not to be such a condition In any department that clerks hired to do work there can bo snared to habitually work ut another place, and it does not accord with a sensible view of civ il serv.'c rerorm that persons should bo employed on tho theory that their labor is necessary in one department when In point of fact ihcir services are devofd to entirely dif ferent work in another department I earn estly urga thit the clerks neces ry to carry oa the work of the commission be regularly put upon its roster, and that the system of oblig ing the commissioners to rel upon the sen ices of clerks belonging to other departments be discontinued. At this time when a depleted public treasury confronts us, when many of our people are en gaged in a bard struggle for the necessaries of life, and when forced economy is pressing upon the great masses of our countrymen, I desire to urge with all the earnestness at my command that congressional legislation be so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an appreciation of tho conduct ot the treasury and. a sympathy with the straitened circumstances of our fellow citizens. Tho duty of public economy is also of immense importance in its intimate and necessary relation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to meet government expend itures and yet reducing the people's burden of federal taxation. This ought not to Increase the expense to the government, while it would certainly be more consistent and adds greatly to the efficiency of the commission. Economy In a public expend iture Is a duty that cannot Innocently be ne glected bv those Intrusted with the coatrol of money drawn from tbe peoplts for public uses. It must be contessed that our apparently end less resources tbe familiarity of our people with Immense accumulations of wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the ex penditure of publio money should in some man ner be to their Immediate and personal advan tage, the indirect and almost stealthy manner In which a larger part of our taxes are exacted, and a degenerated sense of official accountabil ity havo led to growing extravagance in gov ernmental appropriations. Tariff Iteform. After n hard struggle, tariff reform Is di rectly before us. Nothing so important claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents Itself as both an opportunity and a duty nn opportunity to deserve tbe gratitude of our fel low itizens and a duty imposed upon us by our oft repented professions und by the emphatic mandr.ee of the people After full discussion our cout. rymen have spoken in favoror this reform, ane they have confided the work of its accom plishment to tho hands of those who are sol emnly pledged to It It there is anything In the theory of a representation In publio places of tho people and their desires, if public offlcen are really servants ot the people and if political promises and professions have anv binding force our failure to give tho relief so lo g awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our effort un til this reform Is accomplished br wise and careful legislation While - c should staun hly adhere to tho principle that only ibe necessity of revenuo justifies tho imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation and thit they should be llmlte i by strict economy we cannot close our eyes to the fact that condi tions have 2 rown up among us which in jus tl e nnd falrnes call for discriminating caro In the distribution of such duties and taxitlon as the emergencies of our government actually demanJ. Manlfestly.it we are to old the people directly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should be a reduction in present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life The ben efits of such a reduction would be palpable and subst intlallr seen and felt by thousands who would be bet.er fed and better cloth"d anJ bet ter sheltered. These gifts should bo tho willing benefactions of a gov 'rnment whoso highest function Is the promotion of tho welfare of the people Not less closely related to our people's prosperity and well bein Is ths rem vil of re strictions npon the Importation of the raw ma terials necessary o our manufactures. The world should be open to our national ingenuity and enternrle For their goods oon fill the narro market to which they nrs cinllnod Then folio s a suspension of work In niils and factories, a discharge ot employes und distress in tho hem-s of our worklngmen. Even if the often disproved assertion coul I be made good thit a lower rate of ages would result from free raw materials and Invv tariff duties, the Intelligence of our orkIngmn leads them quickly to dis cover th t their steady employ m-nt perm'tted by free raw materials is the Important factor In their re ntlon to tariff eiislation a measure has been prepared by tho appropri ate congressional committee embod ing tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly submitted for legislative a.-tlon. It Is the result eif much patriotic and unselfish work nn 1 1 believe It deals with its subjct consistently and as thoroughly as ex Istlnrcondltlins permit I am satisfied that the reduce 1 tariff duties providol for In the proposed legislation, tidied to existing internal revenue taxation will, in the near future, though pThaps not immediately produce suf ficient recnue to meet the needs of the gov ernment 'Iho committee, after fu'l consideration and to provide against a temporary deficiency which mav exist before tbe business of tho country adjusts itself to the new tariff sched ules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few additional internal revenue taxes. Including a small tax upon Incomes derived from certain corporate investments. These new assess ments arc not only absolutely just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted without unfavorable business disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that its bii:ces can only be attained b7 means ot uns"lfish counsel of the part ot the friends of tariff reform and as a reultof their willingness to subordinate pcronil desires and ambitions to the general good of ihe local interests affect ed by the prop jsed refo-m aro so numerous and so varied tint if all are insisted upou the legis lation embodying tin. reform must inevitably laiL In conclusion my intense feeling of responsi bility Impels me to invoke for tho manifold in terests of a generous and confiding people tho most scrupulous care and to p edge my willing support to every legislative effort for tho ad vancement of tho greatness nnd prosoerlty of our beloved country.
