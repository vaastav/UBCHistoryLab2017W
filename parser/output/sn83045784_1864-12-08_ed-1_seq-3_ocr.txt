WASHINGTON. u UbUtll AMU UNION, MOW ABU KOULVEIl, UNS A BID UlSEi'AHABLa." THURSDAY, DECKMBEK 8, 1864. THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION. In commenting a few days ago oa some views expressed by " The Mississippian " in behalf of " mutual compromise, oonoession, and conciliation/' as means to be employed for the termination of the war, we oonfcssed our gratification at finding suoh sentiments in a sheet heretofore remarkable ohiefly tor the intensity and oonstanoy with which it has advocated the oause of secession. At the same time we felt called to say, in view of Northern opin ion on the subject, that "there can be no 'half way ground of mutual compromise, concession, and conciliation ' whioh does not proceed on the basis of the Union." We added that " so soon as this premise shall be conceded we .do not doubt that the people of the South will be 1 met with liberal terms on other substantial jmd collateral points.'" fn referring to this opinion the New York Times supposes itself to see in such an utteranoe by usthe evidence of a disposition on our part to modify our " views as to President Linooln's position and pur poses in regard to terms of peacfc." Our contempo rary adds: " It may be remembered that when the letter ' to whom it may concern' appeared, we ventured to contest the popular idea that it wai intended as an ultimatum to the rebel State*. The National Intelligencer refuted our views at very great length, and insisted repeatedly, and with rather more than its usual vehemence, that the President could not possibly assent to any peace which did not in clude the ' abandonment of slavery ' as well as the restora tion of the Union. We congratulate our venerable con temporary on the more cheerful view of public affairs which it now seems inclined to take." If the !?imes will do us the favor to recur to the uumbers of our paper containing the disouesions to whioh allusion is made, it will be found that at that date we simply sought to interpret the posi-. tion and purposes of President Linooln by the light of his public declarations on the subject ia controversy. In his rescript "To whom it may concern," ou the 18th of July last, he had said that? * ? " Any proposition which embraces the restoration of peaoe, the integrity of the whole Union, and the abandon ment of slavery, and which comes by anl w;th the authori ty that can oontrol the armies now at war against the Uni ted 8tates, will be received and considered by the Execu tive Government of the United States, and will be met by liberal terma on other substantial and collateral points, and the bearer or bearers thereof shall have safe conduct both ways." It seemed to us then, as it-seems,to us now, that t'xe meaning of these words lies on the surface, but that an analysis of the several clauses of the manifesto served to make their meaning not only clear but irresistible For we not only have in the opening words of the rescript a statement of the terms on which any proposition will be received and con sidered, and not only is the equal indispensability of both the specified terms left to be inferred from the collooation in whioh they are plaoed, but the possibility of any abatement from either of them was excluded by the President's contemporaneous proffer of " liberal terms on other substantial AMD collateral points." The "7>ther substan tial and collateral points" embraoe every thing as to whioh the President was willing to be "liberal," and he exoluded from this classification " the in tegrity of the wlflble Union and the abandonment of slavery'??the latter as distinctly and as une quivooally as the former. If it is within the power of English speeoh more clearly to express the meaning whioh we apprehended in the manifesto, or to exclude the sense in which the Times inter preted it, we confessed ourselves unable to appre ciate the force of language. In order to asoertain whether the President made a sine qua non of both the terms whioh he specified, we had not only the presumption which results from their equal expres sion, but, in addition to this, we had their joint exclusion from the category of subjects open to dis cussion*, an exclusion made positive and express by the statement that " liberal terms" would be offered on "other substantial and collateral pcints." Whatever, therefore, might be the senso in Whioh the President or his friends oonstrued and inter preted these words, there could be, we thought, no cavil as to the sense they bore cn their faoe, or which they yielded to a critical scrutiny. We afgued in like manner with regard to the President's proclamation of freedom. We showed that it was quite true that in his proclamation un der this head on the 22d of September, 18G2, he was careful to premise by saying " that hvreafter cu heretofore the war will be prosccuted for the object of practically restoring the co stitutionol relation between the United States and each oj THI States, and the people thereof, in which States that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed." But it is equally true, we rejoined, that in the body of that proclamation he expressly deolared that " all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall be in rebellion against the United States on the first day of January, 1863, shall bo then, thenceforward, and forever Jree; and the Executive Ooeernment of the United States, in cluding the military and naval authority thereof, will recognise a+d maintain the freedom oj such pernont." On the following first of January, 1863, h? gave effeot to these declarations in his procla mation of that date, in whioh, after designating oertaiu States and parts of States, he said: " I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within the [said designated States and parts of States are and henceforward, shall he jree; and that the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authori tui thereof) will recognise and maintain the free dom of such per tons." In view of suoh declarations we admitted that there was some ambiguity in the President's theo rttieal position For, if we could suppose that all resiatanoo to the Union should be oonquered he fore all the negroes " ordered and dsolared to be free were made practically free, he would, accord ing to his own theory, be compelled to commit what he has himse f described as "an astounding brsaoh of faith " to the latter if he should not urge men to continue " fighting to free negroes." And, if he should urge men to oontinue fighting under suoh circumstances, he would prove that emancipa tion, not the Union, was the ultimate end and ob joct of the war Suoh, it seemed to us, were the two hotua of the dilemma, on the one or the other of whioh the President must be impeled should he aoeept any terms of pcaoo whioh do not equally embrace the practical restoration of the Uuion and the f>raotioal freedom of all tho slaves whom ho ordered and declared to be "now, hincifohth, and loaiVKK free/' and whose freedom he pledged himself ?to recognise and maintain " with all the power of the army and navy of the United States. Hence it was that, with his Niagara manifesto before us, weoame to thefollowiog oonolusion. We quote from the Intelligencer of last August 20th : " Until the appearance of tbe late manifesto we could not foresee that the President would not, at whatever ?aenfice of oonsiateucy, absolve himself from the promises made to the .lave, of the Soutb, if thoae promises should Mem to be in the way of the reatoratioo of the Uuiou , But thst mamfeato o??*ea it clear to our minda that tbe President mean. to follow bia policy to its legitimate and logical conclusions, which neoeaaarily oontemplate the continuance of tbe war until he ahall coerce < the abandon ment of slavery as well aa the territorial ?integrity of the .Tit L ? l! ?S X WbLeQ bolh ends concur that he can claim to have kept h.a engagements.

The Presi dent now says that the Southern people ? can at any moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the Constitution. After so much, the Gov ernment could not, if it would, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain or allow it." In the closing words of his message he adds : " In statiDg a single condition of peace, I mean to say that the war will cease on the part of the Gov. ernment whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it." If, then, the insurgents should desist from their armed resistance to the [Jnion at any time anterior to the actual liberation of all the slaves ordered and declared to be free by the proclamation of Januajy 1, 1803, we now understand the President to say that he would not oontinue to employ the army and navy for tho purpose of " recognising and maintaining" the freedom with which he (on paper) endowed all the slaves in the States desig nated. In this ease, who does not see that the terms of his proclamation were unfortunate, in that they pledged the President to fulfil a promise which he now says he could not keep in oase the insur gents should desist from their struggle against the Government ? Bat, while "presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indinpen table condition to ending the war on the part oj tht Gov ernment," the President adds that he means to " retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat tho declaration made a year ago, that (while ( I remain in my present position I shall not at ' tempt to retractor modify the emancipation pro ' olamatlon, nor shall I return to slavery any per ' son who is free by the terms of that proclamation ' or by any aot of Congress.'" We do not see how the President, regarding the question from a Northern point ofview, can have only one indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government?the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority?if no part-of the emancipation proclamation is to be re traoted or modified; for that proclamation pledges " the Exeoutive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thertoJ} to reoognise and maintain the freedom of all persons held as slaves within the designated States and parts of States." But, if the question be regarded from a Southern or disunion point of view, we can see how it is that the President deems it safe to say that he has only one indispensable oondition of peace, while at the same time adding that he will retraot or modiiy nothing, in his pro clamations on the aubjeot of alavery. It is beoause he oounta on the continued resistance of tho insur gents during a period long enough to afford him the opportunity of making the praotioal resto ration of the territorial integrity of the Union oo inoident with the praotioal freedom of all persons ordered and deolarcd by him to be free. In a word, the President places the keeping of hia consistency on one of these points in the hands of the people of the North, and on the other in the hands of the people of the South. He confides in the determination of the former to keep up tie struggle until he shall be able to restore the terri torial integrity of the Union, and in the deterai nation of the latter to protract the war until he shall be able to destroy slavery. And, while tho civil polioj of tho Government remains in its prc seut hands, and is oonduoted on its present basis, we believe that he does not count in vain on tile determined hostility of the Southern people, and that he is quite right in preparing the minds of the Northern people for the indefinite continuance of the contest in whioh they are engaged, however fallacious may be the arguments by which he seeks to reoonoile them to that prospect. In commenting, only a few days ago, on the "only issue of the war and its solution," the New York Times held the following language : " The Southern muies have been made to believe that the North has beeu fightiog to destroy slavery, to over throw State right*, and to mbjugate and degrade Southern whitea " Who has made " the Southern masses" believe all these things? What has made "the Southern masses" believe all these things'( The answer to these two questions oarries with it the condemna tion of all that we most oondemn in the polioy of the Administration and in the spirit of its principal supporters. We would have had the war kept so true to its original and only legitimate end that there should have been no ground on which to make " the Southern masses" believe that " the North was fighting to destroy slavery, to bver throw State rights, and to subjugate and degrade Southern whites." The Times cannot deny that the policy of the Administration, and of its friends in Congress and out of Congress, has lent itself to the propagation of these convictions at the South, for it has to argue against them eveif at the North, among its own political confederates. It is but two days ago that one of its correspondents protested against its views of the " only issue of the war," as being "opposed to the ancient principles of the Republi can party, to the Baltimore platform, to the policy of the Administration, and to the interests of the oountry." And it was in reply to suoh represen tations that the Times held the fallowing lan guage : " uur correspondent treats this war as if it were a nominal crusade?a John Brown raid on & gigantic scale. It ia just such loose talk that has driven tenB of thousands of true Union men into opposition to the war. But it ia all utterly groundless. The war was not undertaken because slavery ia a moral wrong. We bhould have had no more right to do that than to make war upon a foreign nation because of its internal immoralities It was no moral question at all that impelled our Government to take up arms, nor will it be a moral question at all that will pre vent it from laying down its arms. The only question was a civil one. The war sprung alone from a civil necessity of maintaining constitutional authority; and when that civil necessity is met by universal submission to that authority the war will cease. The Government once made war upon the Mormons of Utah, not because of their Mor mooism, but because they had undertaken rebellion. When the Mormons submitted the war ceased, though the abomin able Mormonism remained. To recognise any other prin ciple than that warp, whether domestic or foreign, are to be waged for no other than civil grievances would soon make the whole civilized world an Aeeldema." If the Administration and its friends had con sistently and unequivocally acted in aocordance with these views of our contemporary we sincerely believe that the war wonld have long since been ended and the Union .restored; for, on the basis of such views, we should have had a united North and a divided South ; whereas we have the con fession of the Times that it is tho prev Utnco or at least the currecoy of oontrary opinions among the leaders of the dominant party in the Government | which has " driven tens of thousands of true Union men into opposition to the war," while at the same time it has made the Southern masses believe that they have good and just grounds for standing out in unalterable hostility to the National Government. We could desire no more convincing argument against the course of events and of political opin ion in the loyal States than that which is supplied by our able Administration contemporary, and we ac cept a full identity with it iu the opinions it pro pounds on this subject We are glad to sec wisdom justified of her children in the ranks of the sup porters of the Administration, though we have encountered much obloquy and misrepresentation for holding pr<joisely the views of this Administra tion paper. So true is it that " Time makes all things even." AN 

OFFICIAL CALL ON THE PRESIDENT. Yesterday afternoon, six of the Associate Justices of the United States Supreme Court (all now present ia the city, bat representing a quorum of the court,) made the annual formal call upon the President. They were received as usual in the " Blue Room." The interview was brief and of a very aocial and pleasant character. Chief Justice Chase, not yftt having taken the oath of office and entered upon his duties, was of course not present. He is expected to take his seat on the Bench to day. 

DEPARTURE OF LORD LYONS. Lord Lyobs, the British Minister, took leave of the President and Secretary of 8tate ou Monday, and the next day proceeded to New York in a special car furnished by the Government. ^His health, it ia stated, is ao seriously im paiied aa to require relaxation with the benefiti of hia na tive air. He carries with him tha respect, sympathy, and t{ood wishes of the Government and people of the United Statei. J Hume Burnley, Esq will have charge of the British legition during the absenoe of Lord Lyons.

The enemy do cot keep up quit* auch incessant | firing aa they did a short time ago. Quite a little fusilade I took place last evening in the vicinity of the Jerusalem | plauk road, but it did not last any conaiderable time, nor effect any important reaulta. A number of brevets have been receuUy conferred upon offloers in thia department. Among the last are Major General tfeade, aa Major General in the regular army, and | Brigadier Generals Ingalla and Hunt aa Major Generals of volunteer*, and Major Biddle, aid to Gen Meade, breve tted Colonel.

Headquarters Arm\ of the Potomac, Tuetday, December 6th. j A flag of truoe appeared yesterday in front of the se j cond division of the Second Corps, bearing a despatch ad dressed to Generals Gregg, Humphreys, and Foster.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Wo to-day spread before oar readers the mes sage of tho President of the IJnited States, as communicated to both Houses of Congress yes terday. It will, of oourse, receive the attentive perusal which deserves to ba bestowed on the an nual exposition of the operations of the General Government. It will be found that the President, more than on any former oooaaion of like character, has con fined himself to a condensed recapitulation of ad ministrative aots and recommendations pertaining to the different branches of the Executive Gov ernment, and has avoided any suggestions or ini tiatives which partake of novelty, as indicating the course which he proposes to pursue in the conduct of public affairs. Under this head tho mossage will disappoint tho general expectations of all parties, as it had been confidently intimated, on tho one hand or the other, that in his present message Mr. Lincoln would take on certain subjects a higher (or a lower) ground than had been indicated by his past declarations and policy. Instead of do ing BOf ho has preferred to make his paper almost exclusively a business document, more remarkable for its comprehensive, if formal, summary of ex ecutive details than for the enunciation of princi ples, new or old, in the conduct of the Govern ment. % We need not present any itsume of the statis tics contained in the message, as they are stated by the President in a shape as sucoinct as we could make it, Our foreign affairs are in u satisfactory oondi tioD, notwithstanding the points of contact and irritation offered by the complications of our civil contest. We learn that in view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent ta the Canadian border, by reason of reoent assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons, who are harbored there, it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expi ration of six months, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement with Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon tho lakes, if they shall find that proceeding neces sary. The receipts during the year, from all sources, including loans and the balanoe in the Trea sury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were $1,394,796,207.62; and tho aggregate disburse ments, upon the same basis, were $1,298,058, 101.89, leaving a balanoe in the Treasury, as shown by warrants, of $96,746,905.73. We are glad to find that, concurring with the views of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Presi dent recommends for the future that the propor tion of moneys required to meet the expenses con sequent upon the war derived from taxation should be still further inoreased. Tho disproportion be tween the revenue derived from contemporaneous taxation and from loans has already tended great ly to produce the weakness of our present financial situation. The President recommcnds the passage by the present Congress of the resolution submitting to the States an amendment to the Constitution abo lishing slavery throughout the United States. This proposition, it is known, failed at tho 1 ut ses sion for the want of a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. The President has no new or more explioit views to annonnce with regard to the terms of peace or the conditions of Union, resulting from his several proclamations on the subject of slavery and of am nesty. He reaffirms tbat the Southern people " can at any moment have peace simply by laying ' down their arms and submitting to the national ' authority under the Constitution. After so much, 'the Government could not, if it would, maintain ' war against them. The loyal people would not <sustain or allow it." At the same time he adds : " In presenting the abandonment of armed reaittance to the national authority on the part of the iniurgentu aa thu only indicpenaable condition to ending the war on tba part of the Government, I retract nothing heretofore aaid aa to alavery. I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that ' while I remain in my preaent poaition I shall not at tempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclama tioq, nor ihalll return to alavery auy peraon who ia free by the termi cf that proclamation, or by auy act of Cofi greaa."' Id the presence of such declarations we presume that " radical" and u conservative" supporters of the President will bo equally fatisfied with his position, and will equally olaim that he has fully identified himself with them and their views. In paint of fact, the emancipation proclamation would undoubtedly fail to receive its full force and effeot if the war should stop at any point short of the actu?l liberation of all the slaves " ordered and de clared" to be free, and whose freedom the Presi dent pledged himself to "recognise and maintain" by the army and navy of the United States. It will be seen that the President holds out no prospect of a speedy termination of the war. On the contrary, he seeks to reooncile the people to the prospect cf its indefinite duration by arguing that if the war is not a positive blessing, it is not such an evil as might be supposed. In confirmation of this oheerful view he points to the fact that we have more men now than we had when the war be gan ; that we aro not exhausted nor in process of ozhaustion, whether regard bo had to our popula tion for the purposo of recruiting our armies, or to our physical resources; which latter, ho says, " are now more oomplete and abundant than ever," the past drain on our material and financial wealth passing in hU eyes for less than nothing. We do not wonder that under euoh impressions the Presi dent should affirm, as he does, that " we arc gain ing strength, and may, if need be, oontinue the con test indefinitely " As our public debt has already assumed oolossal proportions and may affright some persons, especially in prospect of an indefi nite oontinuance of the war, the President sug gests, in another part of his message, that " the great advantage of oitizens being oteditors as well as debtors, with relation to the publio debt, is ob vious Men csadily perceive," he says, " that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe themselves " He makes this suggestion in connexton with the recommendation that Congress should " provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might bo held by any bona fide purchaser, exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under such restrictions and limitations as might bo necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege." We do not doubt the candor of the President when he thus tieeka to convinoe the people that the war may be indefinitely prolonged without entailing, exhaustion on our roaouroM in men or money. And yet we are frank to say that we oould have preferred a lees op timifltio view of the matter, (even in case the war is to be "indefinitely continued/') aa both more manly and more just. We doubt the soundness of any argumentation which seeks to prove that war and debt are not great evils,themselves considered, however incurred. We concede that there arc greater evils than 6itlier or both combined, and in a good cause both may be lightly 'assumed by any people whioh is called by Providonoe to confront such greater evils. But no good caufe requires its votaries to deny the dreadful reality of the sacri fices imposed by war and debt in its behalf; and no brave people requires to bo sustained in the maintenance of a good cause by anysuoh fallacious appeals. We believe that the war for the consti tutional Union, foroed on the Government by an armed sedition, was a good oause; and we believe that in that cause, if kept pure from extraneous issues, the people would have been brave and re solute to endure all sacrifices, without needing to be told that in our ease war and debt arc not the evils they are seen to be in the history of every other nation. We do not believe that the argu ment of the President, under either of these heads, will reooncile any body to the prospect of the " indefinite" continuance of the war, or the "indefinite" increase of our debt, though it would have been easy for him, while acknowledging in their fullest degree the miseries*of both war and debt, to urge strong and impressive considerations in favor of a continuance of the contest till the end be reaohed in a restored Union. In a word, we believe the popular pationoe oould better en dure a long war if it was known that the Presi dent felt war and debt to bo fearful evils, instead of regarding them as infelioitica easy to be borne, for in that case it might be inferred that he would give all his diligenoe to make the war as short as possible and the debt as light as possible. And our respeot for the President's humanity and good sense is suoh that in both these relations we be lieve his oonduct will be better than his logic. THE NEW 

CHIEF JUSTICE Wo understand that tho President yesterday nominated the Hon. Salmon P. Chass, of Ohio, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, to fill the vacanoy orcated by the death of Chief Justice Taney. The nomination was, we learn, immediately and unanimously con firmed by the Senate. The eminent qualifications whioh Mr. Chase brings to this exalted position will be recognised by all citizens, without distinction of pwty, among whom purity of private character in combination with distinguished intellectual endowments are held in honor. The fifth in the line of the Chief Justiocs, he will, we may be sure, worthily sus tain the high traditions handed down by his illus trious predecessors on the benoh of our American Themis. THE
