THE SILVER QUESTION. ffhe President's Views on the Subject of Taxation, the Condition of tliB Currency and the Contlnacd Coinage and Hoarding of Silver—Ho Déclarés It an Illogical and Losing Contest,and Becommends the Sus pension of the Further Coinage of Silver Dollars. We give below the views of President Cleveland on the subject of taxation and on the silver question, as embodied in bis message, but which were omitted In the regular report rather than run the risk of curtailing them, as we deem the matter of sufficient importance to be given i^ full : reduction op taxation. The fact that our revenues are in excels of actual needs ot un economical administra tion of the Government, just ifies a reduction In amount exacted from the people for its support. Our Government is but the meat:s established by the wilt of a free people by which certain principles are applied which they have adopted for their bene'it and pro tection, and it is never better administered, and its true spirit is never belter observed, than when the people's taxation for its sup port is scrupulously limited to the actual necessity of expenditure and distributed ac cording to a just and equitable plan. The proposition with which we have to deal is the reduction of tho revenue received t y the Government and indirectly paid the people from customs dutios. The question of free trade is not involved, nor is there npw any occasion for the general discussion of the wisdom orext edieney of a protective system. Justice and fairness dictate that in any modification of our present laws relat ing to revenae the industries and interests which have been encouraged by such laws, and in which our citizens have large invest ments should not be rnlhlessiy injured or destroyed. We should also deal with the subject in such manner as to protect tiio in terests of American labor, which is the cap ital of our workingmeti. Its stability arid proper remuneration furnish the most justi fiable pretext for a protective policy. Within these limitations a certain reduction should be made in our customs revenue. The amount of suoh reduction having been de termined the Inquiry follows, where can it best be remitted, and what articles can best be released from duty in the interest of our citizens? wiiksk TUB 

REDUCTION SHOULD BE MADE. I think the reduction should be made in the revenue derived from the tax upon the Im Îiortant necessaries of life. We thus directly essen the cost of living in every family of the land, and release to the people in every humble home a larger measure of tho re wards of frugal Industry. During the year ended November 1, 1885, 145 National Banks were organized, with an aggregate capital of $16,938,00», and circula tion notes have been issued to tliom amount ing to .f4,27i,9H>. The whole number of theso banks in existence on the day above men tioned was 2,727. 'Ihe very limited amount of circulating notes issued by our National Banks, compared with the amount tho law permits them to issue npon a deposit of bonds for the*!* redemption, indicates that the volume of our circulating medium may be largely Increased through this instrumen tality. Nothing more Important than the PRESENT CONDITION OF OUR COIUtESCV and coinage can claim your attention. Since February. 1878, the Government has, under the compulsory provisions of law, purchased silver bullion and coined the same at the rato of more than $1, ooj,oo O overv montn. liy this process.np to the present date 215,s.v.), 435 silver dollars have been coined. A rea sonable appreciation of a delegation of power to tho general Government would limit its exerc.se without express restrictive words, to the people's needs and the require ments of tlie public welfare Upon this theory tho authority to ' coin money" given to Congress bv tho Constitution, if it" per mits the purchase by the Government of bullion for coinage in any event, does not justify such purchase and coinage to an ex tent beyond the amount needed for a suffi cient circulating medium. Tho desire to utilize the silver product of tho country should not lead to a tnisuso or the perver sion of this power. The necessity for such air addition to the »liver currency of tho Na tion as is compelled by the silver coinago act is negatived by the fact that up to the present time oaly about fifty millions of sil ver dollars so coined havo actually found their way Into circulation, leaving more than one hundred and sixty-five millions ia possession of the Government, the custody of which has entailed a considerable ex pense for construction of vaults for its de posit. Against this latter amount there are outstanding silver certificates amounting to about $S3,oo.i,W'. idle coin. Every month ?2,0(>i,(H!0 of gold In the pnb lic Treasury are paid out for $!,000.0j > or more of silver dollars to be added to the idle mass already accumulated. If continued long enou-'li this operation will result in "the substitution of silver for all tha gold the Government owns applicable to its general purposes. It will not do to rely upon tho customs receipts ot the Government to make good this drain of gold, because the silver thus coined has been ,made legal tender for all debts and dues, public and private. At times during tl>e past six months lifty-elght per cent, of the receipts for duties have been in silver or silver certificates, while the av erage within that period has been twenty percent-. The portion of silver and its cer tificates received by the Government v.*Ill probably increase as time goes on, for the reason that the nearer the period ap proaches when it will be obliged to offer sil ver in payment for its obligations, the greater inducement there will be to hoard gold against depreciation in tho value of silver or for tho purpose of speculating. the.hoarding of gold has already begun. When the time comes that gold lias been withdrawn from circula tion there will be apparent tho difference be the real value of the sliver dollar and a dollar in gold, and the two coins will part company. Gold, still the standard of value, and necessary in our dealings with other countries, will be at a premium over silver. Hanks which have substituted gold fur tue deposits of their customers may pay them with sil ver bought with such goto, thus mak ing a handsome profit. Rich, speculators will sell their hoarded gold to their neigh bors who need it to liquidate their foreign debts, at a ruinous premium over silver, and the laboring men and women of the land, most defenseless of all, will llnd that the ciodar received for the wages of tholr toil has sadly shrunk in Its purchasing power. It may be said that the latter result will be bnt temporary, and that, ultimately, the price of labor will be adjusted to the change. Hut even if this takes place, the wage-work er cannot possibly gain, but must inevitably lose, since the price l^e Is compelled to pay for bis living will not only be mea-tuied In a com heavily depreciated, and fluctuating and nnceriain In Its value, but this uncer tainty in tho value of the purchasing me dium will be made the pretext tor an ad vance in prices beyond that justified by ac tual depreciation. D aniel webster quoted. The words uttered in 1834 by Daniel Web sterm the Senate of the United States are true to-day. "The very man of all others who has til« deepest interest In a sound cur rency and who suffers most by mischievous legislation in money matters is the man who earns his daily bread by his daily toil." The most, distinguished advocate of blmetàlism, discussing our silver coinage, has lately written: "No American citizen's hand has yet felt the sensation of cheapness, neither in receiving or expending the silver act dol lars, and those who live by labor or legitimate trade never will that sensation of cheap ness. However plenty silverdollars may be come, they will not be distributed as gifts among the people, and if the laboring man should receive four depreciated dollars where he now receives but two. ho will pay in the then deprcciatedjcoin more than double the price he now pays for all the necessaries and comforts of life. Those who do not fear any disastrous con sequences arising from the cont.nued com pulsory coinage of silver, as now directed by law, and who suppose that the acl<i>ti0» to the currency of the country, Intended a» Its result, will be a public benefit, are re minded that history demonstrates that «net point Is easily reached in the attempt to float at the same time two sorts ot money of différant excyilerwj when ta» better will cease to be in circulation, Ahe hoarding of go'd, which has already takeii place, Indicates that we shall no: escape the usual experience in such cases So if this silver coinage b3 continued we may reason ably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon the Held of circulation to mlver alone. This, of course, mast produce a severe contraction of ou a cibculatix® medium instead of adding to it. It wilt not be dis puted that any attempt on the part of tha Government to cause the circulation of sil ver dollars worth eighty cents, side by si le with gold dollars worth one hundred cents, even with the limit that legislation does not run counter to the laws of trade, to be suc cessful must be seconded by the confidence of the people that both coins will retain the s une purchasing power and be interchange able at will. A special effort has been ma le by the Sec retary ot the Treasury to increase tut amount ol our sliver coinage in «ircuiation but the fact that a large share of the limited amount thus put ont lins soon returned tc the public treasury in pavmotit of duties leads to the belief that the people do not de sire to keep It in hand,and this, with the evi dent disposition to hoard gold, gives rise tc the suspicion that there already exists a lack ot confidence among the people touch ing our financial processes. There is cer tainly not enough silver money in circula tion to cause uneasiness, aal tiio whole .amount coined and now on hand might, after a time, be absorbe 1 by tho people without apprehension, but it is the ce iselest stream that threatens to overflow tUe iantf which causes fear and uneasiness. 

WHAT IX OTHER; COUNfKtBS ha9 been thus far submitted npon this sub ject relates almost entirely to considerations of a home nature, unconnected with the bearing which tliu policies of other nation; have upon the question, but it is perfectly appart-nt that a line of action in regaiM tc our currcney can not wisely be settled npor or persisted In Without considering the atti tude on the subject of other countries witt whom we maintain intercourse tiirongt commerce, trade and travel. An ac Snowlediiment of this fact is found in the net )>y virtue of which our silver is «ompulsorily coined. It promues éh at the President shall invite the governments of tho countries: composing the Latin Union, so called, and ol mich other European nations a3 he may deem advisable, to join the United States ln a conference to adopt a com aon ratio be tween gold and silver, lor the purpose ol establishing intern it onally tin tisa of bi roetalic money and securing fixity of rela tive value between these metals. This con - ferenec absolutely failed an 1 a similar fate has awaited all subsequent efforts in the same direction, and still we continue out coinage of silver at a ratio different front that of any other nation. Tl« mast vital part of the silver coinage act remains Inop erative and unexecuted and without any ally or lrlcud. We battle upon the silver field in an illosicit. and losing contest. To give full effect to the design of Con gress on this subject I have made careful' and earnest endeavor since the adjournment of the last Congress. To this end I delegat ed a gentleman well instructed ia fiscal sci ence to proceed to the financial centers ol Europe, and, in conjunction with our Minis ters to England, France and Germany, tc obtain a full knowledge of the attitude and intent of these Governments in respect to the establishment of such an international ratio as would procure free coinage of both metals at the mints of those countries and our own. By my direction our Consul- Gen eral at Paris"lias given'clöse attention to the proceedings of the 

CONGRESS OF THE IATIN UNION, In order to indicate our interest in its objects and report its action. It may be said in brie ? ; as the result of these efforts, that tho atti tude of the leading powers remains substan tially unchanged since the Monetary Confer ence of nor is it to be .questioned that the views of these governments arc In each instance supported bv tlie weight of public opinion Tue steps just taken have, there fore, only more fully demonstrated tho use lessness of further attempt at present to ar rive av any agreement on the subje t with other nations. In the meantime, wa tiro ac cumulating silver coin, based upon our own peculiar rates, to snch an extent and assum ing so Iteavy a burden to be prov.ded for in any international negotiations as will render us an undesirable party to auy future Mone tary Conference of nations. it Is a significant lact that four of t'io five countries composing tho Latin Union men tioned in our coinage act as embarrassed' with their silver currency havo just com pleted nn aareement ainongtlieinsjlves that no more silver shall bo eolned by thoir re spective governments, and that such as bar* been already coined and in circulation shall be redeemed in gold by the country of its coinage. The resort to this expedient by these countries may weii-arrest the atten tion of those who suppose that wo can stvv-. eeed, without sho.-k or injiiry, in the at tempt to circulate upon its merits all the Biiver wo may coin under the provisions of onr silver coinage act. The condition in which our Trea-iury mi y be placed by a p jrsistance in our pres ent course is a matter of concern to- every patriotic citizen who does not desire the Government to pay In silver such of its obligations as should be paid in gold; nor should our condition be s-tch as to oblige ns. in a prudent mguiagement of our affairs, to discontinue the calling in and payment ol interest-bearingobligation», wiiljli we have the right now t > discharge, and thus avoid the payment of further interest therjoa. THE 

DISASTER THREATENED. The so-called debtor class, for whose bene fit the continued compulsory coinage of sil ver Is Insisted upon, ate not dishonest be cause lliey arc in debt, and they should no! be suspected of a dostre to jeopardize the financial safety of ttia country m oi-der that they may cancel fhsir present debts by pay ing" the same in depreciated dollars; noi should it be forgotten that it is not tlio rieli nor tlie money lender alone that must sub' mit to such a readjustment, cnioroed by the Government and their debtors. The pittance of the widow and tiie orphan and the in comes of helpless beneficiaries o£ ail kiads would be disastrously reduced. enough slf.ver ox hand. The depositors in savings banks,andotliei institutions which hold in trust the saviugs of the poor, when their little accumulations aro scaled down to meet the new order ol things, would, in their distivss, painfully realize the delus'on of the promise made to them that plentiful money would improve their condition. We have now on hand all the silver dollars necessary to supply tho present needs of the people and to satisfy those who from sentiment wish to see them in circulation, and if their coinage Is sus pended they can be readily obtained by all who desire them; if the need of more Is at any time apparent, their coinago may be reuewed. That disaster has not already overtaken us furnishes no proof that danger does not await upon a continuation of the present silver coinage. We have been sared ■ by the most careful management and un usual expedients, by a combinat.ionof fortu nate conditions, and by a conlident'expeeta tion that the commerce of the Government in regard to silver coiuage would bo speed ily changed by action of L'oniire-is. Pros perity hesitates upon our threshold because of dangers and uncertainties surrounding: this question. suspension of silver coinage recom mended. Capital timidly shrinks from trade. *r 4 invester8 are unwilling to take the chance of the questionable shape iu which thoir money will be returned to them, while en terprise halts at a risk against which care auu sagacious management do not iirotect As a necessary consequence, labor lacks employment, and suffering and distress are visited npon a portion of our fellow-citi zens especially entitled to the careful con sideration of tnose charged with the dutios of legislation. No interest appeals to us so strongly for a safe and stable currency as the vast army of the unemployed. I ree! ommend the suspension of the coinnulsnpif coinage of silver dollars directed by the law passed in February, 1S78,
