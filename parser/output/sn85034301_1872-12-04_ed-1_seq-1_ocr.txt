It makes the head feel no good. i-Nold everywhere. See advertisement Mr. Renne claims that the name '"Magic Oil is his "trade mark." and that all persons who use that name for a medicine do so at their peril, as much as though they stole any other projerty of his, be sides their extra meanness ! The genuine Renne's rain-Killing Magic Oil is what the people want and will have. Pure Starch. When starch is pure, it is free from sourness and is purely white. Inferior starch has a golden or yellow tinge, the color of flour, indicating the presence of gluten (a color not desirable in one s linen), or is sour ana musty. It is absurd fur the laundress to cleanse and bleach and then discolor linen with im pure golden or yellow starch. Duryca's "Satin Gloss Starch'' is snow white, per fectly pure, and the most economical starch known. TELEGRAPHIC. Wonderful Display of Grief at the Funeral. IMMENSE TURN-OUT OF THE PEOPLE.

Resignation of Judge Nelson. Appointment of Ward Hunt to the vacancy. Ixnior.sTABi.E Bread. The reason why those baking powders in the market adulterated with Alum, Chalk, Earth, and other substances makes bread and biscuits very indigestible, is because they harden the gluten of the wheat and render it less soluble. Now this is not the case with Dr. Price's Cream Baking Powder; its purity and perfect combination enables it to render all articles easy of digestion, be sides preserving their natural taste. Those who have not should test them, as also his elegant Special Flavorings, so and to-day the body lay in state at the City strong, so pure, so true. I Hall.

Dr. Chapin read sev eral passages of Scripture, which were especially appropriate to the last words uttered by the deceased. Henry Ward When Weed approached the casket, he bowed over the body, and gazed long and earnestly at the face of hi former asso ciate. He seemed deeply affected, and after looking at the featunis of Greeley for some time, he leaned on the arm of a friend and left the room. As the multi tude filed by with uncovered heads, each one was allowed sufficient time to view the dead. Many ladies showed signs of emo tion, some stopping to kiss the forehead of the deceased. As the dinner hour of the working class approached, the crowd awaiting admission became enormous. Laborers came down town in their working clothes to get one last look at the face of their cheery old friend. Working girls of all ages came from their factories and stores and were very properly allowed to pass in before the men. It was also a no ticeable fact that many negroes, both men and women, were in the line. The stream of people anxious to gaze on the face of the dead continued undi minished until ten o'clock this evening, when the governor's room and City HaU were closed. Probably fully 50,000 persons viewed the body, and many thousands did not even reach the steps of the City LI all, the line extending for blocks away. No such evidence of public esteem has been snown since the time .Lincoln s remains lay in state here. Flaps are everv-where at half mast, and crowds are arriving by trains and steamboats from adjacent cities. The City Hall is draped in mourning and over the entrance hangs the inscription. e remember with pride his busy lite Many distinguished citizens from abroad have arrived to join in the funeral services Courts will adjourn over to Thursday. Editors of newspapers throughout the country are requested to mail to Ezra Cornell, at Cornell University, Ithica, N. Y., copies of their papers containing eulo gies or other articles upon the death of Horace tireeley, to be comprised in a me niorial volume for the library of said Uni versity, of which deceased was one of the 1 rustees. Washington, Dec. 3. The President leaves here to-night by the 8:40 train for rtew itork to attend the funeral ot Horace Greeley. Vice President Colfax left at noon to attend the funeral. The report of the Secretary of State shows that two hundred and ninety-two thousand dollars were paid B. C. Davis as liearer to England of the Alabama treaty. The treaty case cost five hundred arid eighty-two dollars and freight on it was seventy-eight dollars. The aggregate cost of cable telegrams was $o,60o. Judge Nelson, of the Supreme Court, has resigned. The President has accepted the resigna tion of Justice Nelson, and has nominated as his successor. Ward Hunt, of New York. Senator Pool sends the following tele gram from Raleigh : "We have defeated j the Democrntic legislature by electing Merrimon. It breaks up the power of the Democrats, and brines a valuable and con troling element in the State over to the Administration." Salt IiAKE. IVe. 3. The report of I the President's message relating to I" tab. is highly grafilying to the anti-Mormons. The Herald says the President has been misinformed and misled, and that in no part of the United States is the constitu tion held in more reverence and the laws esteemed more sacred than here.

Woodward's powerful discourse on the life and character of the deceased, and at the conclusion Miss Kellogg sang with gTeat effect : '"I know that my Redeemer liveth." There was scarcely a dry eye in all the assembled thousands. Great numbers of organized societies of all kinds were in attendance. All kinds of business seemed wholly sus pended, esecially on the line of the great procession. lVesidcnt Grant, Gen. Sherman. a part of the Cabinet, Minister Washburne. and many Senators and Representatives, in cluding a number of the Diplomatic Corps and other distinguished personages attend ed the funeral. All the houses on the line of the funeral cortaec were closed and drafted in mourning. Flags were everywhere displayed at half mast. The crowd was simply enormous, the streets everywhere on the line being crowded and packed with people, who, with uncovered heads and sorrowful looks, evinced the sincere grief they felt at the loss of this truly great and good man. The solemnity and imposing dignity of the occasion has never been equaled in New York. , In other cities, everywhere, tokens of mourning are displayed New York. Tec. 3. The remains of Mr. Greeley arrived at the City Hall as early as eight o'clock. They were borne there in u simple heare, attended by an escort of honor. The coffin, in the pres ence of comparatively lew spectators, was carried to the Governor's room and placed upon a temporary bier. The coffin was black with heavy silver handles. At Uie head was a portrait of Greeley as he ap peared in lite and a large cbaplet ot tube roses. The lid bore the inscription : 'Horace Greeley: born Feb. 3, 1811: died November 2tth, 1S72," and was orna mented with festoons ot natural tern leaves. At the head was a second inscrip tion : "I know that my redeemer liveth," and yet another at the loot worked vio lets : "The city mourns our loss." Gree ley lay with his" left arm lying by his side, and the right across his breast llis face was terribly emaciated and worn, utterly unlike that which his daily companions have been accustomed to see. His ap pearance was that of a man who had, al ter terrible sufferings, succumbed in a proloneed fight with the combined lorces of mental and bodily anguish. lVeparations for receiving the public were not completed until 10 o'clock, but as early as 8 the square in front of the eitv hall was occupied by thousands of men, women and children, intent upon taking a farewell look at the face of Gree ley. Everywhere the utmost decorum prevailed. There was no jostling, no at-, tempts to obtain advantageous positions. A hush prevailed in the assemblage, and each face wore a look of intense silence. The multitude was formed in line and passed up two by two to the room where the body was lying m etate. ime oi tne first men to approach the coffin was Gen. John A. Dix. Allium? the man v distinguished gentle men in tie room was Tim rlow Weed, one of the oldest friends of Mr. Greeley. The old man sat near the head ot the body and seemed pleased to be questioned con cerning the life and character of the de ceased. He said he could not remember that Greeley ever referred to any youthlul amusement. They had been young Mien together and as such were otten in each other's eomnanv. "Everybody," said Weed, "has hours ol relaxation, but Greelev never olaved. I was as poor as he, and had the battle of life to fight as he had, and yet I always took relaxation. We isrenf different temperaments. Look ing back over Mr. Greeley's life I think he showed u much nnselfish ambition as any man that ever lived. His whole life was riven to opposing injustice and oppression. His character was perfectly pure, for he had no fault that I knew of and I was mtmt intimate with him in all matters. He was fearless in the expression of Ms belief in what was xkht His whole aim was to San Franoisco. Dec. 3. At the States prison to-day several convicts scaled the walls and escaped. j Lovpon, Bee.
