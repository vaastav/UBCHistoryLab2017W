THREATENED TROUBLE AT GOLDFIELD. The sending of troops to Goldfield Is for the purpose of protecting men there who desire to work for the mine -operators, for the purpose of protect ing the property of the companies and to protect the property of every citi zen of the placo who owns any. Gold- field has heretofore been under, tha domination of the Western Federation of Miners; a strike Is now on there and the companies have announced tho intention of resuming work the.ro as an open camp. No cae will deny the right of the company to employ nonunion men It they so desire, ex cept the federation miners, who have quit work and are disposed to make trouble for anyone who would attempt to take their places. The troops were asked for at Gold field" as a precaution against such oloody trouble a3 occurred at Coeur d'Alene and Cripple Creek, when an attempt was made to shako off the TCYretam Fnriprattrm minora , from Tho attempt of the miners' union to prevent non-union men from tak ing the places of union men, where a -strike has Jieen ordered, has caused the shedding of much blood in Colo rado and Idaho, the los3 of millions of dollare In property and the shed ding of many tears and the bearing of many hardships by women and child ren who were left penniless by hus bands deprived of work. There should be no necessity for troops to keep order while the Gold- field companies are filling the places f the minora who are on strike and there would not be only for the as sumption of the union miners that no one has a right to work unless he car ries a union card and obeys the com mands of the labor agitators and an- ion leaders. The disposition to harass and Ln- mfliate every man who remained at woTk at BIsbee last spring when tho federation strike was ordered shows what the1 Western Federation of Min--ers stands for. In BIsbee tho majority -remained at work; that camp had al ways teen open bunion and non union men alike without discrimina tion. In Goldfield tho situation Is dif ferent There the union has been In complete control and tho task of re- -sumlng work, &3" an open camp will be herculean In comparison to that of continuing BIsbee as an open camp In opposition to the attempt of Canon, Rawfings, Semple, et a!., to unionize tho camp. At Goldfield has been gath cred all the big- labor agitators and a desperate resistance may be expected to the open camp proposition. - This paper has always contended tiat unions would become much -tresger and much more effective In "bettering the conditions of labor It "(y T7Qald ,recogIe tie right of any- . c one who desired to do so to conduct the open shop. Certainly this coon' try must protect every man who de sires to work, regardless of whether he belongs to a union or not and if it requires soldiers and guns to afford this protection there will bo general approval throughout tho country. V&U "EXPRESSION' OF GRATITUDE. The Safford Guardian concluding a review of the statehood fight in con gress and a fino eulogy of Senator Foraker Bays: "Mr. Foraker had won the ftght for right, and Arizona stood erect and ra diant, dlenthralled from Roosevelt's unholy policy and purposes. As long as Christian hearts can feci the throb will have a grateful welcome for For aker. As tho years go by and Arizona maintains her entity In greater grand cur, our affections will grow warmer toward tho sturdy 'veteran who de fended us from (ho deep damnation of jointure, and shielded our averted faces from tho remorseless onslaught of the 'Big Stick.' fhis Is a sentiment entirely credit able to tho Guardian and to whoever else- who entertains it. A contrary sen timent would be discreditable to any Arlzonan who believed then or be- been a curse to Arizona, for Ingrati tude Is jeckcaed tho meanest of all human emotions. Wo can think of no other epithet which contains so much of opprobrium as "ungrateful dog." That Arizona, owes Its freedom solely to Senator Foraker no one now disputes. It Is true that the, opposi tion to jointure had Its origin among Arizonans who fought valiantly against 1L They accomplished all that was possible for them to do only to meet defeat In the- house, over whelmed by tho power of the speaker and the president. There was little that they could do in tho senate be yond enlisting the interest of Senator Foraker, but that was enough. He did the rest. However beneficial tho public ser vice of any man may have been, he may nullify It all by subsequent un worthy acts and prove that he is un worthy of public confidence, but what has been the offense of Senator Fora ker that enemies, a few In Arizona, as well as many outside, assail hlraZ They say he has obstructed tho re form policies of the president. That Is his unpardonable sin. Nothing else. How many of those sacred policies have encountered Senator Foraker's opposition? Only three, joint state hood, the rate bill and the summary discharge of tho negro battalion at Brownsville. Those in Arizona inclined to revile Mr. Foraker wlH hardly do so on ac count of his hostile attitude toward the president in respect to statehood. As to the rate law which has como to be regarded as a disappointment by many who formerly favored It, ioTwipUInn Q- spect tne senator ior ms aiuru opposi tion to a measure, unless as a means of benefit to the people but of mixed advantage and disadvantage to the railroads. We have as much to do with the Brownsville affair as we would have to do with any difference of opinion between Mr. Foraker and the prpsi deno regarding the cut of a coat. So Senator Foraker has done nothing since ho saved Arizona to deprive himself of the respect and gratitude of Its citizens. Phoenix "Republican. The figures given In the public doc uments confirm the Idea that what ever may be the matter with the cur rency supply, this la a time of great and general industrial prosperity. C

New Zealand makes a poor showing In its railway operations, which are a branch of its numerous projects in public ownership. Yet that large Isl and Is most favorably situated for ex periments of this nature. It is an Isolated community, with full charge of Its local affairs. Its population of three-fourths of a million are intelli gent, enterprising and active In politi cal duties. Their study of public own ership has covered many years, and they have gone into the science of co operative politics on a scale not at tempted elsewhere. One of the evi dences of the fact is the remarkably large public debt of .$298,000,000, or 5335 per capita. Of this amount $f20, OObiOOO has been incurred for state railroads. For the year ending March, 1906, a net profit is claimed on the railroad system of 3.02 per cent but the interest paid on the debt is 3.75 per cent, so there is manifestly a de ficit As a matter of fact the loss is larg er when proper allowance Is made for maintenance and fresh equipment One prominent New Zealand writer says the railroads, if a commercial concern, would be bankrupt, and his figures placo the net loss in ten years at $21,000,000. Pasenger rates aver age two cents a mile, with a train speed of not over twenty miles an hour. No passenger trains are run -: -ii re i-u. .ft are five times as high in New Zeamuu as In the United States. It Is said that politics has much to do with the operation of New Zealand railroads in construction, selection of officials and promotions. One charge is that some of the roads were built for cam paign purposes. New Zealand has had a large assortment of public owner ship fads and has put many of them In practice. The resulting debt Is ex ceptlonally heavy, with the advant ages In general more than doubtful. THE MESSAGE. Here Is the comment of the Albu querque Journal, leading republican paper of New Mexico, regarding the recent message of President Roose velt: The president's message, read In congress Tuesday, Is presented to ocr readers In fuH. It Is a strictly per functory document, and reads as though It had ben written by the president simply and solely as a mat ter of duty. All the characteristically Roosevelt features of positiveness, which might have been woven Into It so abundantly, under tho circum stances, are noticeable solely for their absence. It talks at a great many subjects, and talks cround a great many more, and withal, fulfills the constitutional requirement of com municating with congress at the be ginning of the session." , Says an exchange: "The emigrants returning from this country will re- raarfc -when they get a homo job tfc the pay for a day's work looks like thirty cents. Most of hem will come back. A taste of Uncle Sam's wages Is apt to ha permanent" The New York state league lost I twenty-eight tacB br ple.asd draft J in 1907. Harmnif H a 333 with I fj Q Quality.

New Mexico to have it also, why didn't he say something about it in his message? If President Roosevelt was not trimming for the purpose of getting' the next uclcgitlos; frors" these two territories to the next na tional republican convention, he was giving a life-like imitation."
