Whenever Lap Is Nearly Gained . : Someone Falls, and Gain Is Not Allowed. 

RIDERS LEFT TRACK, BUT WERE INDUCED TO RETURN Nearly Three Hundred Miles Behind the World's Six-Day Record. NEW YORK. Dec. 14. Two stirring incidents marked the progress of tho six-da' bicycle ni.ee at Madison Square Garden early today. Tho first came at 2 o'clock, following an attempt of John Bedell, of tho Walthour-Bedell team, to gain a lap. Just as he seemed certain to succeed, Fogler, of tho Poot-Fogler team, fell, causing a spill in which half a dozen others unwillingly participated, and making Bedell's work go for naught. Several of the riders were temporary- disabled, Vanderstuj'ft suffer ing most severely. The accident and the subsequent pro test of Walthour and Bedell, who claimed that Fogler fell purposelv. so that they could not gain the lap. caused a long suspension of" tho race. Walthour and Bedell refused to continue to race, and nearly an hour was lost, before thej' could be induced to resume riding. The other incident was a sensational nttempt by Bedell and Walthour, at 3 o'clock, to gain a lap and make their score equal to that of the leaders. The sprint was one of the wildest and long est of the- contest. It lasted sixteeu minutes, and while it continued tho 8000 people in the garden choered up roariously. Walthour and Bedell relieved pach other several times, us did also Breton and Samuelson. Stot and Leon Georget had to go it alone nil through tho sprint, which placed them at a disad vantage. There was a long delay in announcing the 4 o'clock score, and when it was made public it was seen that, the timers had not given any gains or losses during tho sprint. At 2 o'clock the nine leading teams had covered ISOo miles aud 6 laps; Walthour and Bedell, Brotou and Sam uelson, ISOo miles nnd 5 laps; Gnlvin and Wiley, 1S05 miles and 3 laps. -The leaders are about 320 miles bo hind the record made by Millor and Waller. The score of the nine leaders at 3 o'clock was 1821 miles and 7 laps, with tho other throe' teams trailing in tho same relative positions as before. IILL REORGANIZE THE BIG IMPLEMENT TRUST J. P.

SALT LAKE HAS THE PAY-DAYS If you ask business men how thoir holiday trade. is this year you will be told that it is better than it ever has been before in the history of the city. The good housewife is "spreading hersolf" for this Christmas as sho has never beon able to do heretofore. Daddy has been working HUo a Trojan all the year and ho la still at It and those good old pay days havo come along regularly, so that thorc lias been a continuous stream of sustenance flowing Into the home. Another reason why people are sponding their money so freely this yoar is in tho fact that next year thoro Is to bo more to do than ever, and thero is no danger that tho pay days will coaso. Every man in town can get work If ho want3 it; and thoro Is scarcely a man in town who is holding a job but has another ono offored to him. No wondor that Santa Claus is loading up with all sorts of good things for ovory'body; .

Tonight's game of basket-ball between the fnsL B, Y. C. team of Logan, and the Y. AI. C. A. team, promises to be a lively discussion of the relative merits of the enms. Tho gamo at Logan last Monday night should not be taken as final Judgment of the relative mcrltH of the two leamn, owing to the fact that by nu unfortun ate coincidence one regular learn 'guard and three substitutes were unablo to leave the city and In order to pi-event a disappointment of the Loganltes. the management of that team very gener ouuly permitted us to play the coach, Mr. Klwood Brown, at guard. Conse quently we wish to have It known that wc would not consider this game as con clusive evidence of team superiority. The matter of officials will be difficult to solve. Every effort has been made to secure outside official but without success. The Logan team very gener ously asks that an Association repre sentative act at? referee. Thin will not bo permitted If any possible avenue of escape prcsonts Itself, as tho Associa tion has established the precedent in accordance with a very strong senti ment that exists In all Associations all over the country, that of never appear ing as an official In our own game. As a preliminary for Saturday nlpht'fi big gamo the reorganized Granite Stake team will play the Association's second team, the outcome of which Is very doubtful, owing to recent strengthening of the Granite Stake team.
