DECEMBER 4, 1901. -B--?---1^--MM-OT <f Sumter Watcnman was rounder 10 ^50 and the 7Vae Southron in 1866 ^c?cftnic??. and Southron now has 11 sn bi neu circulation and influence of both of the old papers, and is mani fe> y the best advertising medium ia /Sa m ter The houses cannot be numbered two quickly. We want free mail delivery and nothing stands in the way of it but the delay in numbering the houses. If straws show the way the winds blow, there will be mightly near a full "Sicket in the field for State offices com? posed of State House office holders and attaches. The negroes say that a man has "done gone to keep books for de rab? bits" when he takes to the woods to escape arrest for selling a crop under lien. Advices from B'rer Rabbit are, that he is overrun with bookkeepers this year. * The Charleston Exposition opened with religious exercises Sunday and on Monday the gates of the big show were opened wide for the admission of the sight-seers of the world. The show was incomplete on the opening day and will be? for several weeks, perhaps, but when all of the exhibits are in place Charleston's Exposition will be the greatest ever held in the South and a visit to it will be a libe? ral education. It is a great thing for South Carolina and we shall feel the benefits for years to come. The Republican newspapers and maga2'ines are still publishing yards of gush over the the great triumph of decency and honesty over Tammany and corruption in New York city, bu? in keeping with the proverbial hypo eraey of that party, next to nothing has been said of the triumph of the eorrupt and more rotten than Tam? many machine in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia thieves and all round rascals, being Republicans, it is all right for them to rob the city and debauch the morals of that commu? nity, and nothing is said in the public prints controlled by the Republicans. The News and Courier came out Mon? day with a special edition of twenty four pages commemorative of the open? ing of the South' Carolina Inter-Sta.te and West Indian Exposition. The News and Courier has done magnifi? cent work for the Exposition from i.ie inception of the enterprise and the success that has attended its efforts cannot but be gratifying. No one has done more for the Exposition than the News and Courier, none has given more generously of time, talent ar.d means to make the great undertaking a success, and credit should be given where credit is due. The prices paid for farm lands sold by the Master Monday under order of the court show that the people who have money to invest still have confi? dence in the country. When farm lands sell under the hammer for an average of nearly ten dollars an acre, in a year of such extreme finan? cial depression as this has been and is, it is clearly evident that though the times are hard, confidence has not been lost and that there is substantial hope for better times in the near fu? ture. The new First Baptist Church, of which the cornerstone was laid Sun? day with impressive ceremonies, is nearing completion and will goon be regularly' occupied by the congrega? tion. It is a handsDme and modern edifice and is a credit to the city of Sumter. The Baptist congregation are to be congratulated upon the frui? tion of the hope of many years and the people of Sumter rejoice with them in the possession of one of the handsomest houses of worship in the State. The farmer who does not plant oats this fall, would have refused a round trip ticket on the Ark, had he lived in antediluvian days. The Charleston Exposition was formally opened on Monday with im? posing ceremonies and the greatest enthusiasm. Few of the exhibits are in place as yet but the buildings are practically all completed and the grounds have been beautified under the direction of an accomplished land? scape artist. Those who visit the Ex? position immediately, expecting to see a complete show will be disappointed, for it is not now as complete as it will be. but it is already a show worth a trip of hundreds of miles. It is a great show and when all the exhibits are in place it will be the greatest ever held in the South. Congress met on Monday and for the next few months the Republican members will devote their best talents to devising measures and means to spend all of the immense revenues raised by the tariff and internal reve? nue taxes, while the Democrats will endeavor to reduce the tariff and repeal the war taxes and thus relieve the people of the burden of taxation that the legitimate needs of the gov? ernment no longer render necessary. The Democrats as a rule favor the immediate construction of the Nicara? gua canal, and it is believed that there are enough Republicans of the same opinon to insure tho passage of the bili authorizing the commencement of work but it is feared that the Republican? leaders will insist on putting through the ship subsdiy steal asa prerequisite to any action on the canal question. They will seek to sand-bag the coun? try into swallowing the ship-subsidy and if they fail will still have the strength to defeat the only measure of first importance to the entire coun? try that will be before the present session. The summary removal of the gov? ernor of Oklahoma by President Roosevelt and the straightforward statement of his reasons for this ac? tion are creditable alike to Theodore Roosevelt and the high office he fills. Boodlers and venal politicians of all kinds who are now using the positions they hold in the public service for their private advantage are undoubted? ly having an intensely uncomfortable time of it now, for it is being: brought home to them that there is not only an honest man in the White House but a man with the courage and the back bone to hit a rascal wherever he finds him. Roosevelt is all wrong on the social equality question but when it comes to turning the rascals out he seems to be the right man in the right place. About Children's Reading. What should children between six and twelve years of age read? Answers to this question have lately been given by Kate Douglas Wiggin, friary Mapes Dodge, Edward Everett Hale, Horace E. Scudder, Agnes Repplier, Tudor Jenks and others, together with some extremely sensible and interesting suggestions as to the principles underlying the choice of children's books. Here is a single typical list from the ten included in the article which The Outlook pub? lishes in its Annual Book Number. The list is that furnished by Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge, Editor of Saint Nicholas. / 1. "Alice in Wonderland." 2. Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales. 3. Eawthorne's "Wonder Book" (or the 'TanglewoodTales"). 4. "Gulliver's Travels." 5. Kipling's "Jungle Books" (or Seton-Thompson's "Wild Animals I have Known, " or Harris's 'Uncle Remus.") 6. Dana's "Two Tears Before the Mast" (or Nansen's 'Farthest Horth, " or Kennan's 'Tent Life in Siberia"). 7. Scott's 'Ivanhoe" (or Howard Pyle's "Robin 5cod," or Lanier's "The Bov's King \rthur",. 8. Gibson's "Ey?-py," or some other good nature-book. 9 Hooper's "Leater Stocking Tales" (or Stevenson's "Kidnapped"). J.O Scud ler's "Children's Book" (or Miss Repplier's "Book of Famous Verse"). OUR 

INDIAN PROBLEM. The Unrsed States government has a lew phase of its Indian problem to leal with. Our management of the Indians so ;ar cannot be called a shining success ind it remains to be seen how we shall mceeed in our attempt to convert ;hem into citizens. It has been determined to abolish ;he tribal government of the Indians, ind our policy is now being directed ;oward the elevation of the red men to ull citizenship. Commissioner Jones, who is at the lead of the bureau of Indian affairs, s in favor of promoting the independ? ence of these former wards of the na ;ion and has great hopes of the success >f that policy. It may be that when the Indians are hrown to a larger degree upon their >wn resources they will develop better jualities and finally become good citi :ens. Most of the Indians will have a "erv good start when they are set up n business for themselves. Some of he tribes have a much greater per r?pita wealth than the people of the Jnited States and the poorest of them lave a considerable amount of proper y. Whether the average Inidan can wer have his wild and savage instincts ?radicated and be tamed to quiet and eliable citizenship is a question upon vhich there is a wide difference of ?pinion, but the Indian has never had i fair trial yet and his civil capacity :annot be estimated until we experi nent further with him.-Atlanta fournal.

Washington, Dec. 1.-One of the ?rst measures of national interest which will be introduced in the senate at the session which begins tomorrow will be a resolution looking to public action concerning the death of Presi? dent McKinley. This will be present? ed on Tuesday by either Senator Fo raker or Senator fianna, probably the former, and after its introduction the senate will adjourn immediately as a mark of respect to the memory of the lead president. The annual message of President Roosevelt will not be read until Tues? day, and on this account the session Df Monday will be exceedingly brief. Et is not now expected that anything will be done on that day beyond the announcement of the death of Senator Kyle, following which the senate ,in accordance with custom, will adjourn ror the day. On Tuesday tne presi? dent's message will be read, and after tts reading the announcement of the ieath of President McKinley will fol? low at once, whereupon, under the orecedent establised when Presidents Lincoln and Garfield died, a resolution providing for the appointment of a committee to act with a similar com? mittee of the house of representatives ;o take appropriate action relative to ;he matter, and then calling for imme? diate adjournment for the day will be adopted. Heretofore committees have Deen appointed to arrange the details )f public exercises, and it is under? stood that that plan will be pursued n this instance, and that later in the session some public men of distinction viii be invited to deliver a eulogy in ;he capitol.
