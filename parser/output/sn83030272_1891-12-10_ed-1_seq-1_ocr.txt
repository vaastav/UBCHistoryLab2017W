In the Hcnate tlio document I .

For tho first hour ot tho road- Ins the Itcpubllcnn Benators. as a matter ot formal courtesy, romninod in tholr seats and pearly nil ruld attention to what Gen. McCook was saying. Several ot the able Bon xtor. howovor, were too preoccupied or too lUltm to listen to the reading. Among theso were senators l'lumb nnd Dawes, who read the niornlug papers; V'olcottand Mnndorson.who 1,1 r hack In their chatrs and told tunny stories; Dolpli. u ho' wrote luttors, ond Hoar, who performed a very romarkablb act for, him. of burying his head In, his arms on top ot his desk anil losing himself in- slumbor or thuutflit. Senator Ciwnoron talked to ills clork form. hour, nnd Senator .Proctor followod tho rinding of the messngo with a wise look of lipiprietorihip. especially when tho portion routing t'i tho W.ir Department was reached. Tim otlur Senators malntatnod tholr dignity, Int looked frightfully borod. . , btin.itorlnl courtesy docs notroaulre that the Domocr.itslntliochnmbor should pay polite tit t ntlun to tlio reading ot Presidents' mes j8u -. .uid so it was that Bonators Vest and 11ivoivro tlio only Bonators on the Demo cratic side who appeared to be listening to anything tho message contained. Less than eno-half of the Domocrats wore present in the chamber. 31 r. Gorman, who is tho recognized leader o( Ills party on tho floor, sat in his cen tral scat, conferring with membors ot ,tho Uoum and others who came to talk with him. Senator (Korge, the groat Constitutional law yer, turned his back squarely on Secretary .McCook. possibly without any Intention ot slighting either tho Secretory or tho President. and read n newspapor during tho ontlro dreary tno hours that wore consumod in tho reading. In the House it is not tho custom to listen to the roadlng of Presidents' messages, and sotvliUotho blg-lunged clorks of that unwieldy tody woro ploughing through their elocution ary exercise tno 330 odd members chatted and laughod. wrote letters, and read papers without restraint, and thore were not a score of the entire number who heard more than a paragraph or two ot the thirty-six printed 4pes upon which the President had be stowed such great care and labor. It was thought that as most ot tho members M art. now to Congressional life, they ' would be impressed with their own impor tance as well as that of tho President, and would Indicate their feelings by giving pro found attention to his words of wisdom. They did nothing ot the kind, however. They seem to have been impressed thnB early with the proverbial professional lack ot hero worship, andthox went about getting acquainted with .eacAplaer and finding out what their per quisites am in the way ot patronage and docu ments, without heedlng what the President lulu tpitay about the Chilian question, the gerrymandering of the Congress and legislative alstrjetSf and the other important matters to which; Ke refers. The general publio seemed to be as unmindful ot the courtesy due the President as tho Bonators and llepresenta tives are. Thore was merely a handful of spectators in the gallerios of caoh House, and in the brown seats of the diplomatic corps In the Senate chamber thero wore five attache's ot various legations, who seemod to bo very much sur prised at tho cool treatment which the Presl-. dent's recommendations met with at the hands of the statesmen. Kach house ad journed as soon as the last word of the Presi dent's message had been delivered to thorn, and at once croceeded to be interviewed in reply to the question which comes to them yoar af ter year: " What do you think of tho mes ' Face?" Tho ltepubllcans. especially thoso who hadn't heard a word of it, said that it was a strong document, and some of the Demo crats s&jd so, too, especially Senator Morgan. vmorn Mr. Harrison nod quoted as a friend tvltn him of tio Klcaraguan Canal Company.

TUB SENATE COMMITTEES Tho SenaU) oommltteo of nine, who aro re constructing tlio Senate committees, nnd who ozpoctod to be ablo to mako a roport to-day or to-morrow, now find that tholr task will not be completed until some tlmo next weok. Ono of the committeemen said to-dny that If ho had known how fussy United States Senators ore when it comos to getting committoo assign ments he would have refused the tank which he nnd his colleagues havo on hand. The com mittee held n protracted session to-dny. and accomplished n great doaL Thoy. still havo many little dllTorenoes and jealousies , to overcome, however, one ot tho most nnnoylng bolng the somewhat bold ambition ot Senator Stewart of Nevada to become u member of tlio Committoo on Appropriations. This Is one of tho moat important committees of Congress, ond in some respects tlio most influential ot nil. Tho Sonate always has Its way In tho llnnl strugglo on appropriations, especially when controversies reach tho stage of oonforonco oommlttoos. Mr. Btewnrt. his eolleagues say, has no partloular clnlris to the very prom inent and Influential placo whloh ho seeks ex cept that he isono of tho most constant de baters In tho Nonato. He Is lying back on the prop of sonlority as effected by Senatorial courtesy, howovor. nnd notwithstanding tho opposition of most ot tho Senators, particular ly Mr. Washburn, who wants the jplnoo himself. Mr. Sto wart Is hopeful that he will win. MILTJ9 FKELINQ VKBT SORE. Representative Mills is aufforing from the reaction of tho terrihlo strain of tho last few days that resulted In his defeat for the Speak ership nomination. He has been besiegod with inquiries about his future course, bulls not in a mood at presont to take the publio in to his confidence Mr. Mills Is physically and mentally a sutTcror.and does not wish to mako publio his Intentions with regard to his future politloal oourso until he has had time to think over tho situation. The tact that ho was sulky yesterday and refused to accom pany the Houso Committoo to wait upon tho President, nnd tho further fact that ho purposoly soloctod a seat In an out-of-tho-way part of the hall, has led to the roport that ho Intends to accept his dofeat as an an nouncement that his policy Is no longer to do thrust UDon the Democratic nnrtv In thn House, and to keep himself In the background accordingly. In answer to this report Mr. Mills deollnos to talk, but contents himself to say sarcastically that lying Booms to be indulged in by certain per sons. The dofoated candidate for Bpcakor feols vory sore, not entirely, perhaps, because of tho dofoat of his personal ambition to sit in tte Speaker's ohair. but because ho is lnolinod tlTrogard tho eloation ot Mr. Crisp as n significant rebuko to tho policy of which he has been a conspicuous advocate for many years. Mr. Mills, howevor. is a very Impetuous man. art to do things on Impulso nnd afterward regret his notions. Itwns this charactorlstlo that led him to say last spring that ho desired to go to tho Senate from Texas, and conso- 3uently would not bo a candldato for tho poakership. Had he not made this unneces sary romark he might havo farod hotter In tho fight that closed last Monday evening. Whether Mr. Hills could now como to tho Bon ate, if ho so desired, is a question which no one In Washington sooms nblo to answer. Senator Chilton, who was on Monday sworn In to fill the unexpired terra of Senator liengan. which will oxplre In 1803, will bo n candldato for reelection, and thore aro othor Texas cent le mon who will display a like ambition. Mr. Mills was not a supposter ot Chilton for tho place, and It Is possible that he might not be nble to overcomo tho opposition of his rivals. The Sonatorship will be vacant on tho day that his present term In tho Houso expires, and the result of next year's elections may havo a con trolling influence upon his future action. td2.ee rmzs and eletex lives lost. Tour Flreaieat Six 'Working; Girls, and a Bnalmess Man Killed. Louisville. Dec. 0. In a series of fires on West Main street to-day oleven lives havo been lost, nearly $500,000 worth of prop erty destroyod. and several singular ac cidents occurred. In t tho early even ing the store and stock of the Boone Paper Company was destroyed, entailing A loss o( $85,000. At 2:35 o'clock this morn ing an explosion occurred in the adjoining building ocouplod by Bamberger, Strong k Co. The shaky walls crumbled, and before It was subdued the stores ot Bamberger. Strong iCo.. Bliss. Wilson k, Co.. Johanbocke & Sons, and Miller. Wool! oik. Payne & Co. had been gutted. At least four nromen were burled under falling walls, all honk and ladder men. Four others are badly hurt. Tho dead firemen are William Mooro. William Davis, Bamuel Baker, and Tony Bchllcht. At S o'clock another fatal fire began. It was In F. A. Menu & Co.'s wholesale candy and fireworks house, a square abovo the Boono Paper Company's building. Forty girls were at work wrapping candy on the fourth floor. The lire was out at 11 o'clock, and the work of taking out tho bodies began. Tho bodies of six girls wore soon takon out, burned beyond identification. O. T. Monn, brothor of tho senior member ot the firm. Is supposod to havo been burned to death. The lire cut off escape by the stairway leading to tho fourth floor, where the girls wore at work, and mnny jumped from 'the windows to a second story projection and oscapod with broken limbs and bruised bodies. Others got out unhurt. The flro in tho Boono paper company's build ing was supposed to be fully extinguished a little after 8 o'clock last night, and later all tho engines were withdrawn. With Its forces woakonedand demoralized by the accident of the early morning to tho ladder men. tho Flro Department was called to tlio third disaster at the candy factory. To add to the casualties and tlio contusion Major Hughes, Chief of tho Fire Department, was so badly hurt in an accldont oarly this Bornlng that ho may not rocover. Ho and ear weathorford, his assistant, started up Market street. Thoy got on tho wrong side ot the street. The snlvago corps wagou ran into their buggy and ran over them. The buggy was smashed and tho salvage horses trampled on both Chief Hughes and Weathorford. The letter's wrist was badly hurt, and whon tho Chief called nut for help Weatherford was unable to go to his assistance. Major Hughes was takon to hit bed, and tho doctors fear serious results. While on the way to the fire No. 13 Englno ruu into the ourb at Twolfth street nud Broadway, throwing oft Engineer Nuttall, hurting his back ana probably crippling him tor life. Pat Shea, a member ot No. 1 Hook and Ladder Company, was at work on the building occu- Jiled by Frank A. Monn k Co. Ho startod to all. but grabbed ut tho broken skylight Ho saved himself from probably n fatal plunge, but nearly severed his hand from his arm ut tho wrist. In the face of thoso disasters tho flro men kept ut tholr work. 'Tho water-tower was manned and u dozon streams brought to bear on Monn's place. Within hnlf an hour tho flames were under control. Of tho forty girls, two escaped at tho cost of grievous wounds. They wore Theresa Hulthaus and Lizzie Mc Oincy. Ono of them hus a broken leg and the injuries of the othor woru in ternal. The flro is supposed to havo orlglnutod from ono of the cnmly furnaces, which possibly oxnlodod. Tho Ilamos com municated with tho now and.' big stock ot Cnrlstmus fireworks. The first explosion among the llreworkH scattered the firebrands all ovor tho store. Tho skylight toll in and tho entire stock, much ot which was highly In flammable, was llorcely blazing utmost imme diately. The skyrockets, itoman candles, nnd giant firecrackers wore wild In their hnvoo nnd Impeded tho work of the flrcraon, making It exceedingly dangerous for them until tho last one had exploded.
