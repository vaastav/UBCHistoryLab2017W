Combination of Southern Transportation Lines Believed to Be Under Way by New York Capitalists. Charter Is Filed Under Laws of New Jersey But No Intimation Given as to Its Special to The Globe. NEW YORK, Dec. 10.— A charter was filed under the laws of New Jersey at Trenton and New York this afternoon which, apparently, is intended for a com bination like that embraced in the char ier of the Northern Securities company, which is absorbing the securities of the Northern Pacific, Great Northern and other Western railroads. The title of this new corporation is the Southern Securities company, and, ex cept as it differs in certain provisions, which have been the subject of adverse criticism, it is substantially the same as to object, power and privileges as the Northern Securities company. It has a nominal capital of $100,000, but it can in crease the amount at its pleasure. Who and what are behind this \ew charter are not "disclesed on its face, and the names of the corporators, presumably dummies, do not convey any information. They are: C. Frederick Smith, John R. Turner, Edwara B. Hawkins, Edward T. McGoffin and Walter H. Bond. The charter states that the objects for which the corporation is established are to construct, operate and control trans portation undertakings, terminals and fa cilities, to develop properties undertak ings, industries, enterprises or companies for transportation by land or water; pro vided, however, that this company shall not engage in any business which shall require the exercise by it of the right of eminent domain within the state of New Jersey, or, except as permitted by local laws, without the said state construct, lease, own, operate or sell transporta tion line or lines by land or water in any estate or country, • either directly or through the ownership of stock of any corporation, but always subject to the local laws of such state or country; and to act as the fiscal agent for any of the above or like purposes or any other cor poration, to issue bonds, debentures and other negotiable or transferable instru ments or otherwise, and., to the extent permitted by the local laws of each state and foreign country, in which the prop erty may be situated, manage the affairs or lake over and carry on the business of any company or companies so formed or to be formed, either by acquiring the shares, stocks or other securities thereof cr otherwise howsoever, and exercise all or any of the powers of holders of shares, stocks or securities therof and receive and distribute as profits the dividends and interests on such shares, stocks or securities. It may conduct business in any of the states and in any and all for eign countries and hold and convey real and personal property, provided nothing MALAYS NOTWANTED AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LAIIOR WANTS CHINESE EXCLUDED FROM UNITED STATES OTHER ASIATICS MUST GO, TOO Ticket Scalping Is Favored by a Large Majority—Agitation for Trade Label Defeated. SCR ANTON. Pa., Dec. 10.—The exclu sion of Chinamen, Japanese and other Asiatics from American territory, ticket scalping legislation and advisability of adopting a universal label for union made goods, were the principal questions that claimed the attention of the dele gates at today's two sessions of the American Federation of Labor. The res olution advocating the exclusion of the Chinese was adopted by the convention with considerable hurrah, but in the mat ter of excluding natives of Japan and other Asiatic lands a snag was struck, and this part of the anti-Mongolian agi tation was killed so far as the present convention is concerned. The ticket scalping debate was quite a lively affair. The delegates representing the railway telegraphers opened the fight against the resolution, making the point that such action was beyond the jurisdic tion of the federation. The "typos" were hfclped along in their arguments for the adoption of the resolution by several so cialistic members of the convention. When the viva voce vote was taken those in favor of permitting ticket scalping won by an overwhelming majority. The agitation for a universal label, which has been carried on for a long time, was again defeated. The convention disposed of much rou tine business during the course of the day. The important question of trade au tonomy will be sent to a special commit tee, which will be announced tomorrow. 

ROCK ISLAND BREAKS IN PROBLEM OF REDUCING TIME GET TING COMPLEX. Special to The Globe. CHICAGO, Dec. 10.— The fast-time prob lem between Chicago and the Western and Northwestern gateways Is becoming more complex. Additional difficulty was added today when General Passenger Agent John Sabastian, of the Rock Is land, demanded that, in considering the question, Denver be added, and that any solution that covered the other gate ways must be one that will include Den ver. At the meeting called for today a com mittee was appointed to 'canvass the lines and then draw a plan or solution for presentation at a meeting- tomorrow. This committee is made up of the follow-' ing: George Charlton, of "the Alton; Join Sebastian, of the Rock Island; P. s. . Eustis, of the Burlington, and W. B. Kniskern, of the North-Western. If the position of the Rock Island is strictly adhered to it is likely that the committee will be unable to agTee upon any plan. The North-Western officials are not I Real Purpose. herein contained shall be construed to authorize the corporation to transact any business in any other state, territory, or foreign country, contrary to the provis ions of the laws of such state, territory or foreign country. Meaning of Last Clause. The last clause is apparently quite a new provision and is no doubt designed to avoid the difficulties raised by the charter of the Northern Securities com pany. The company is author ized to bold its meetings and to have one or more offices and to keep the books of the company within or without the state of New Jersey at such place or places as may from time to time be designated by it, provided, however, that any stock holder of record who shall have owned stock In his own name to the amount oi or exceeding 10 shares for at least three months previous to such application, shall have the right upon application in writing to such board to personally (not otherise) inspect at a time and place to be fixed by the board any book or ac count, record, document or paper of the aforesaid corporation; provided, how ever that the board of directo::-" shall have the right to decline to permit any such inspection to be made, in case it shall be satisfied and by resolution shall declare as the grounds of such refusal that such application is not made in good faith. This last provision for the inspection of the company's books and accounts avoids the violation of any federal law which may be passed pursuant to Presi dent Roosevelt's recommendation that certain publicity be required of all cor porations and so-called trusts. The char ter further expressly provides that the power to declare, fix the time of payment and pay dividends shall rest wholly In the discretion of the directors ot the company, that the directors shall have the power to reserve as working capital or as surplus for the said company or for any other purpose which they shall deem conducive to the business of the company such sum or sums as from time to lime shall to them in their absolute discretion seem fit and proper. In some quarters it is believed that the new charter is for the purpose of carrying into effect the many railroad combinations which have been recently talked of, more particu larly the Southwestern system of rail roads which would include the Missouri and Southern Pacific railroads. Mr. George Gould, who arrived home late this afternoon, could not be found thia evening, but it is good opinion that he has something of the above nature under consideration. ready to lengthen the time of their "Overland Limited," claiming that this train should not be considered as an Omaha or Denver train, as it carries few passengers for the former and none for the latter city, through which it does not run. The St. Paul people, however, in f-ist that by taking the "Overland Lim ited" ft is possible for travelers to reach the Northern Pacific coast points in less time than it is possible to do by the St. Paul gateway.

BEATEN BY BEVERIDGE INDIANA SENATOR WINS AGAINST ENTIRE ORGANISATION Appointment of Judge Baker Is a Blow 'l'hnt Almost Kills Senator Fair banks. FROM THE GLOBE BUREAU, Washington, D. C. "WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—In the ap pointment of Judge Francis Baker to the vacancy on the federal court of the Sev enth district, which includes Indiana, Illi nois and Wisconsin, President Roosevelt today turned down Senator Fairbanks "and practically the entire Republican or ganization of India ai. Senator Albert J. Beveridge comes out a winner. Baker was Beveridge's candidate for the place. The only other member of the congres sional delegation who indorsed Baker was Representative Lincoln Brick from the extreme north end of the state. Bak er lived in Brick's district. The organization, headed by Harry- New, state committeeman, was pluming for other candidates, and the field' was united on the opposition to Baker and Beveridge. There were a dozen candi dates for the place. favored Judge Moncks, of the state supreme court. A. B. Anderson, of Crawfords ville, was the favorite of C. C. Shirley, of Kokomo, and was touted by Repre sentative Overstreet, but they all- went wrong except the young globe-trotter, who is making so much unhappiness for his colleague senior senator. Roosevelt likes to make good appoint ments, but he knows little about prac tical politics. Fairbanks is the gumshoe rival for the presidential nomination in .1904. Beveridge is willing to take second place on the Roosevelt ticket and help Roosevelt get first place. Beveridge is the strenuous kind of proposition Roose velt likes, and, Fairbanks is not. Accord ingly, there - are influences at work to break up the Fairbanks organization in the state of Indiana, and there will be factional doings from this on.
