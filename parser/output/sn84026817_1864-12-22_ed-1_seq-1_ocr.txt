Congress, at its lost session, noting upon tho recommendation, did provide for reorganizing the system in Califor nia, and it is believed that under the present organization the management of the Indians there wilt he attended with renHOnnblc success. Much yet remains to be dona to provide for tho propar gov ? ernment ol tho Indians in other parts ol the country, to render it secure for tbo advancing settlers, and to provide lor the welfare of the Indian. The Secre tary reiterates his recommendations, and to them the attention of Congress is in vited. PKNsIONS.

DISTRICT OF COLUMUIA I cliecrlully commend to your con tinued patronage the benovolent institu tions ol the District of Columbia, which have hitherto been established or foster ed by CongresB, and respectfully refer, lor information concerning them, and in relation to the Washington-aqueduct, the capitol, and other matters of local interest, to tho report of the Secretary. AGRICULTURE. The Agricultursl Department, under the supervision of its present energetic and faithful head, is rapidly commend ing itself to tho great and vital interest it was created to advance. It is pecu linrly the people's department, in which they feel more directly concerned thau in any other. I commend it to the con tinued attention and fostering caro of Congress. THE WAR. Tho wrr continues. Since tho last annual message, all tho important lines and positions then occupied by our for ces hove been maintained, and our ar mies have steadily advanced, thus lib erating the regions left in the'rear; so that Missouri, Jiontuoky, Tonnessoo, and parts ol other States, have again prcduoed reasonable fair crops. The most remarkable feature in the Military operations of the year is Gon. Sherman's attemptod march "of 300 miles directly through the insurgent rogion.? . It goes to show a great increase of our relative strength, that our General in chief should feel able to confront and hold in chock every active force of tho enemy, and yet to detach ft well appoint ed large army to move on suah an ex pedition. Tho result not yet being known, conjecturo in regard to it is not I here indulged. Important movements | have also occurrcd durieg the yoar to tho effect of moulding sooiety for dura-j bility in the Union. Although short of complete tuocess, it is bo muoll tn tho right direction, tliot 12,000 citizens in each of the States of Arkansas nnd Lou- | isianft hovo organized loyal Stato Gov- | ernments, with freo Constitutions, and j aro earacBtly strujgling to maintain and administer them. The movement in the same direction, more extensive, though loss definite, in Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee should not be overlooked.? liut Maryland presents tho example ol complete success. Maryland is seeure to liberty and Uuion for all the future. Thr genius of rebellion *ill no moro claim Maryland. Like another foul sp:rit he iug driven out, it may seek to tear htr but it will woo her no more. 

AMKSHMEKT OF TUB CONSTITUTION. At the last session of Congress a pro fosrb amendment of the Constitution, abolishing slavery throughout the Uni ti'd States, passed the Senate, but fulled, for lack of the requisite twj thirds,vote, in tho House ol Hcpreieutativet. Although tho prcsout is the same Congress, and noa.ly the same members, wiihoat questioning the wisdom or pa triotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recorotdend the reconsider ation and pnssago of tho monmro at the present fusion. Of course tho abstract question is not changed, but an interve ning eleetion shows almost certainly that the next Congress will pass the measure, if this does not; hence there is only n question of time as to when tho propo sed amendment will go to the Stales lor their action, and n< it is to go st all events, may wo not agree that the soon er tho better. It is not claimed (lint the election has imposed a duly ou members to change their views or their votos any further than as en additional element to bo considered. Their judgment may bo effected by it. It is the voieo of tlis people now for tho first timo heard upon the question. In a great Na tional crisis like ours, unariimimity ol action among those seeking a common end is very desirable, almost in dispensable, and yot no approach to such unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall be paid to tho trill of the majority, simply because it is the will of the majority. Iu this case the common Qnd is the maintenance of the Union, and among the means to secure that end suuh will through the election is clearly declared in favor of such Constitu ional amend ment. Tho most relioblo indication ol public purpose in this country is derived through our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass and its result, tho purpose of the people within tho loyal Slates to maintain tho integrity of tliu Union was never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than now. The ex inordinary calmness ami good order -wHtMiish the mil.itna of voters met and mingled at the polls gnvo strong assurance of this. Mot only all those who supported tho Union ticket, so called, but a great m jority of tho oppo sing party also, n.ay be fairly claimed to entertain, and to be actuate*! by the sains purpo.-e. It is an unanswerable nr).u j menl to this effect, that no candidate for any office, whether high or low, has ventured to seek votes on iho avowal that ho was for giving up the Union.? There has been much impugning of mo tives, and much heated controversy as to tho proper moans and best mode of advancing the Union cause, but iu the distinct issue of Union or no Union, tho politicians havo shown their insltnctlvo knowledge that thcro is no diversity a:r,ong the pcoplo in awarding the peo ple the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world this firmness anil unanimityofpuriio.se. The election has been of vast value to the national cause. Tho election has exhibited another fact not lest valuable to he known; tho fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of tho national resources, that of living men. While it ia melancholy to reded that the war ha) filled so many graves anil caused mourning to so many homes, it is some rolief to know that coiuparcd with the surviving tho fallen have been so few. Whole corps and divisions and brigades and regiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gnno out of existence. A great majority ol men who compri sed them are still living. The tamo is true of tho naval service. The oleclion returns proves this. So many voters could not else be found. Tho Ststos regularly holding elections both now and four years ago?to-wii: California, Con. neclicut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylva nia, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Vir ginia and Wisconsin cast 3,982,011 votes now, against 3,870,222 cast then; showing an aggregate now of 3,398,214, to whioli it to be added 23,762 cast now in the new States of Kansas and Nevada, which Statea did not vole in 1860; t.ius ?welling the aggregate to 4,016,773, and the net increase during the throo years anil a half of war to 146,761. A table it appended showing the particulars. To thia ngnin should be added tho nuubors of all voters in the field from Massachu setts, Rhode [almd. New Jersey, Dela ware, Indiana, Illinois and California, who by the law of those States cannot vote nway from their homes, and which number cannot be less than 00,000, nor yot is this all. Tho numbor in organi zed territories is tripplo now what it was four yoars ago, while thousands of white and black join us as the national arms prosi back tho insurgent linos. So much is shown affirmatively and negatively by the election. It is not material to in quire how the ifarease has benti produ ced, or to show'ifcnt ii would have been greater bui for tho war, which is proba bly iruo. Tbo important I'sot remains demonstrated Wai ire havo more mun now than when tlso war began, that we aro notisxhaustod nor in pro cess of exhaustion; that wo aye gaining strength, ami may. il neod be, maintain lie contest intttflnitcly. Material re souroes aro nSw more comploie and abundant than'iver. Tiio national ro aources then, VS unexhausted and, as wo believe, injuchniijtiblo. The publio purpose to re-establish anil maintain the National ospaoBy is unchanged and as wo believe unsaleable. The manner of oominuing tjj effort remains to choose On careful eotMJeratinn of all tlio ovi donee acocssibfe|il seoms to me lliot no attempt at negifetions with tho insur gent loader cq^4 rc,ult in any good.? Ho woulil aci'pb of nothing short of the severance ol fln| Union. ll<s declaru lions to that, mad are explicit and of re peated use. flSNoes not attempt to do coivo us, Htrjjufordg us no excuse to deceive ourseljfis.

Tn what spirit and temper this control would bo ex r.iscd oan bo fairly judged by tho past. A year ago, general pardon and amnesty, upon spo cified terms, were offered 10 oil except nortain designated enemies, an I it was at tho samo time ma'e known that the ex cepted classes were still within contem plation ol specinl clomency. During the \ear many availed themselves of tho general provision, and many more would only that the sipns o( bad faith in somo led to such precautionary mensures as rendered the prac:i3u 1 procoss less oasy and cerium. During the simotime also special pardons bave been grantod to in dividuals of excepted clusiesand no vol untary application has been denied.? 1 hus, practically, the door has boon for a full year open to all except such as were not in a oon iilion to make free choice; that is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is slill open to all, but the time may come, whon pub lii demand that it be closed, and that in lieu more vigorous measures than here tofore shall be adopted. In presenting the abandonment of ar med resistance to tho national authority, on tho part of the insurgents, as tho on ly indispensable condition to ending tho war on the part of tho Government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to sla very. I repeal the declaration mado a year ago, that whilo I remain in my present position, I shall not attempt to retract or modify iho Kmancipation Pro clamation, nor ahall I return to slavery any person who is /roe by iho torms cf that proclamation or by any ol tho acts of Congross. If tho people should, by whatever mode or means, mako it my executive duty to ro cnslavo such per sons, anoihor, and not I, must bo thoir instrument to perform it. In stating ? singlo con lition ol'poaco, I mean simply to say that the war will ccate on the part of tho Government whenever it shall have coased on the pari of those who be gan it.

Abovo Charleston flail works have loug sinoo been oslablislicd, al though upon a diminutive scalo oompar od with those of Salina. Tliero is obun dance of material, but a scarcity of cap ita!.

Almost every steamer brings thither speculators from Chicago, Now York, Philadelphia, and other principil eitics, who have bar. tof'ore boen ignorant of the bound less wealth of this region. Capital and enterprise will yet to ike tho Kanawha a household namo. In reality, there is a pecuniary feast epread out boforo the mooi-yed men of New York, not only of the oily, but of the interior. The question may be asked. Why hsinolthe wealth of Kanawha Valley horetoforc boon more fully dovelopod? nicause, for years previous lotlu out break of tbu rebellion, Kast Virginia prnyod herself antagonistic lo ihe woslern section of tlio Stato, placing every pos siblo barrier in tlia path of advancement, envious of her rosourcos and her market.
