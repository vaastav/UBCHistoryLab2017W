Field in London on Thanks- ! dring r.iglit was worth a great deal more r ban the scanty abstract the Associated Press t doled out to the newspapers. The Jlritish J premier spoke in full as follows : VV. Gla<l*iont?Mr. Field and gentlemen, I '( don't know, sir, whether you have been for- \ innate in this choice of the individual whom r von have honored by requesting him to respond to this toast, but 1 feel quite certain 5 that vou have been fortunate in the occasion j on which it is givcni# It is given on a day ] when, in full consonance with the Christian 1 feelings of your country, you render thanks I to the Giver of all good for the bounty which c Ho has poured out, and it is given on a day t when there is gathered around this hospitable r t.iou'-uoaiu u uiiuj ui gcuueincn unueu witn u yourself in a groat work which constitutes at c once one of the most signal triumphs of o modern science and of the few guarantees for o | the peace and unity of the world. [Cheers.] j 1 therefore feel sure that this is an occasion a eminently suited for the expression of the C ?entinients which you have embodied in the r words of the toast, "Greet Britain and the j United States of America, two countries des- p tined to be united in friendship as closely as a they are in kinship." I hope, sir, that that C is the ease, ar.d I firmly believe that your a toast speaks no more than the truth. 1 am t afraid, Mr. Field, it often happens that when 11 special friendship between two countries is r boasted of, that it does not so much mean the appreciation they entertain of one an- t other as an autipathy toward somebody else, s The meetings of the representatives of* conn- g tries are not unfrequcntly considered to be 1' the token of something that is formidable to li flieir neighbors?but if there be, as I think v v there is, a special relation of friendship be- r. tween England and America, it is a friend- r ship which implies nothing injurious and notli- 1 ing disparaging to any other country in the b world. [Cheers.] It is not founded on any ii views of aggression that we entertain in com- ii mon. It is hardly conceivable that there g ever should be any object which was desired f only by England and America, unless it were c an object beneficial to every other country in 1 tue woriu. it is a specialty of friendship, h founded upon the close relationship of our v race, upon a united language, upon sympathy c at least if not identity of institutions, on love c of freedom and rational order?self-govern- b mcnt which alike distinguishes these two ( great countries, [dicers;] and if we found the speciality of our friendship upon considera- s tions such as these, we found it upon a basis ii which we desire not to l>e peculiar to our- \ selves, but which we shall he glad to see oc- t cupied in common with ourselves by every s other people on the face of the globe, v [Cheers.] It is quite true, sir, that the rela- \ tions of England and America have been c marked by features which arc, I believe, v without a parallel in history. It is not ortcn r that history has given us an example of a t colony like the United States, a colony, or a s combination, of companies so vigorous, so t full of promise and of power, so different \ from any of those colonies that have been s founded by other European countries. When c the day of separation came it came attended r by circumstances of pain and exasperation, C but it now affords happiness for both sides of t the water when we can look back to it with- I out cither pain or exasperation, and on your a part I am quite sure you are ready to feel and s to make allowance for a gallant people, who a believe, though erroneously, that they were \ straggling for national life, and that upon the 1 unity of the Empire depended the hanniness i of the country. ~ We, on our part, are now j i able to sec that with motives honorable, we were in error; that we were struggling against nature; struggling, I may venture to say, ! even against Providence, and Americans themselves do not more honor the da}1 of f their emancipation and their independence t than we Englishmen, who give them the full . tribute of our sympathy, and who would not, $ if we could, undo or reverse the course of i things. [Cheers.] r Mr. Field, the relations of the two eoun- c tries, close as they had been, and severed as t they were by so severe a process, were dis- i tinguished in another most important par- c tic alar from every other case of the kind that f has been known in the history of the world. ( We were severed politically from one another, r but the severance was not what, to use a t homely expression, may be termed a clean \ severance. It was not, for example, as in c the case of the two countries of the Peninsu- r la, which, when they were severed from their j colony and possessions in South America, t had no longer any special relations or any t special controversies subsisting between c them. After the independence of the United t States was established, Great Britain con- 0 tinued to be an American power. c From that circumstance, and from many t other circumstances, it has happened that, t while on the one hand there has never beer, c a mother and daughter country that had such ' strong reasons for friendship and affection, \ neither has there ever been a mother and a ( daughter country which in time of independ- t ence were menaced with so many possible g subjects of controversy, and of possible dif- ? Terence and discord, and consequently there j has been all along this singular contrast in j the feeling of the people of the two coun- s tries toward one another that while we have j been powerfully attracted by all those cases j to which I have referred, while we have felt j how the seal of brotherhood has been stamped j upon us by the hand of the Almighty llim- i self, and that the noble motive that tended to promote a true union of feeling was further . quickened by the vast and extraordinary community of interest between us ; yet, on the other hand, at almost every point of the I. wide circumference, there were questions of controversy which, from time to time, divided us, which it was a work of time and difficulty to settle. Until this present day it would hardly have been practicable to point to the moment at which there has not been some one or other subject of correspondence, and even of dispute, remaining unsettled between Kngland and the United States. But, Mr. Field, there is this happy difference to be observed. I have said that we have had the most powerful impulses to union and concord. I have said we have had many occasions of difference and of controversy, but the occasions of difference and of controversy were in their nature temporary, and capable of being settled by intelligent good seusc and friendly temper. The time of that settlement has now happily arrived, when we can speak of it as a thing to be hoped, not a tiling to be desired, but as a consummation which lias happily been accomplished. [Loud cheers.] Those temporary differences have passed away, the motives to union remain. They arc not like other controversies marked with a fugitive and transitory character. Every one of them is profoundly rooted in 1 the circumstances of the two countries, and in the character of the people by which they are inhabited, so that although there has I been in other times a strong and unconquer- ' able sentiment tending toward fraternal | union, yet that sentiment has heretofore been liable to be conquered by opposite and contending currents. Now it can move with a full and equal flow, with nothing to interrupt it, and nothing to fix the term of the duration of the feeling which we rejoice to know exists.

We have already expressei >ur aversion to the idea of undertaking a gi ;antic system of national improvements un ler the direction of Congress; but the sub ect to which the President has just directei Congressional notice may thus perhaps gaii rider consideration among those whom i nore especially concerns. The great problem of the West is, how t< ;ct its products to the Atlantic seaboard irincipally with a view to reshipment ti Curope. It is roughly and perhaps inaccurate y stated by Western producers that they ge >ut one-fourth of what consumers pay to sverything raised in the Mississippi valleyhe other three-fourths go to railroads an< niddlcmen. The feeling upon this subject i; icrv strong at the West; it touches the pock t-ncrvc.

Then there is a slightly novo ihase of the very old project of the Kanawh; nd James river canal, to connect with tlx Chesapeake and Ohio canal.

The annual commerce which threads ts devious way through the coral reefs wliicl uard Florida" Pass, is variouslv cstimatei rom $750,000,000 to $1,000,000,000. A shii anal through Florida, near, for instance .'ftiupa Bay, would pass through a district mt iittle above sea level, to harbors of deep rater on either side, and could not be exeedingly costly. Mobile and tho watei ommunications of Alabama would be direct!} lenefited at once, and the trade of New )rleans would be immensely increased. So long as the South alone was to be asisted by this improvement, tho prospect o! ts execution might be indefinitely delayed, Vithout discussing the reason, wo suppose he fact will be admitted, that works of this ort are talked of at the South n very long rhile before they arc begun.

Wool and Leather.?Tho eniire woo product of the country is 100,000,000 pound* and some 70,000,000 jiound.s are imported About a third of the clip of last spring is stil held back, the price has been linn, and man ufacturers have groaned over the narrow margin of profit on their goods. There wa in Boston on the day previous to the fir from ten to twenty millions of pounds c wool, and half of this was destroyed in th fire. This tends to unsettle the wool markel and to place a new phase upon the relation between the manufacturer and the woe dealer. The obvious tendency is to advanc the price both of wool and of domestic wool ens, large stocks of which were burned a Boston. The leather market and the boc and shoe market are also affected by this fire The destruction of these goods was immense and there must be an immediate productio to meet the current demand. This wilt giv fresh activity to the industries of many thri\ ing towns in Eastern Massachusetts, and ai at once in repairing the damage bv the fire W NA

His sleeplessness was ! , c known to have become greatly worse, but for ' e years bo bad suffered more or less from the j ] il same difficulty, and, as is now clear, sufficient j ( - allowance bad not been made for the intense ; ( - j strain upon him throughout the summer, cspc-1 ( - cially during the last month of bis wife's ill- j , J I ness ; but it soon became evident that bis ' j ^ I strength was unequal to the hard task to j j t ; which be set himself. lie wrote onlj- three j , i or four careful articles, no one of them more ; j 0 j than half a column in length. The most , , notable, perhaps, was that entitled "Conclu- '< a sions," wherein he summed up bis views of ( - the canvass. In all he wrote less than three , t and a half columns, after his return, contrib- , r uting to only four issues of the paper. Two < ; or three times be handed his assistant abort ( 1 articles, saying, "There is an idea worth , 9 using, but I haven't felt able to work it out. f - Probably you had better put it in shape." j - At last, on Tuesday, the 12th Instant, he j - abandoned all efforts to visit the office regu- . . larly and Sent for the family physician of A. j ) J.

Dr. George x S. Choate and others were called in con- < J saltation, and finally it was decided to take j t him to I)r. Choate's residence, two or three ] i miles distant from Mr.Greeley's own country f t home at Chappaqua. Here he received un- i 1 re nit ting attention, and here Dr. Drown and j . others were called in consultation. The in- s , samnia had developed into inflammation of p - the brain. The venerated patient rapidly sank; at times ho was delirious, at other times as clear-headed as ever. He lost tlesh ; and strength with startling rapidity, and in s t a few days the possibility of his speedy death ? ; forced itself into unwilling recognition. It a > was not, however, until Thursday last that s his associates and family brought "themselves r s to admit it, and oven then they still clung to - j faith in the vigor of his constitution. On ! Wednesday night he failed very rapidly. 1 l Thursday afternoon and evening he seemed a I somewhat easier. During the night ho slept f i very uneasily, muttering occasionally and p , frequently raising his right hand. Toward u t morning he was more quiet, and between 8 i; i and 9 o'clock fell into a nearly unconscious f condition, which continued with somo inter- I: r vals through the day. He made occasional a ' exclamations, but many of them, in consc- a quence of his extreme weakness and appa- t rent inability to finish what he begun, were p unintelligible. About noon, however, lie t f said quite distinctly, and with some force, "I t . know that my Redeemer liveth." During s > the day he recognized various people?his a i daughter many times, the members of his u ; household at Chappaqua, John R. Stuart, and s Mr. Reade; on the whole lie suffered little, and seemed to have no more than the ordi- a r nary restlessness which accompanies the last h stage of disease. During the day his ex- li i tremities were cold, and there was no pulse p at the wrist. The action of the heart was k , very intermittent and was constantly dimin- t : ishing in force. He had not asked for water, t ; nor been willing to drink it since his stay at p Dr. Choate's, but during Friday lie asked for I s it frequently. Up to within half an hour of c ' fhf> pnrl ho monifnaf/wl in t?ftwni,o "* i consciousness of what was going on around ii him, and even answered in monosyllables d I and intelligently questions addressed to him. h r About halt-past 3 he said very distinctly, "It n i is done and beyond the briefest answers a > to questions, this was his last utterance, b His younger daughter, Miss (labrielle, was d with him through Thursday evening, a Throughout Friday, the elder daughter, f Miss Ida, was in constant attendance, as b she had been during the hours of his illness n and of Mrs. Greeley's beforo him. Other h members of his Chappaqua household were u , present, with Mr. and Mrs. John It. Stuart p ; and a few other friends. Nothing that tl i science or afl'eetion could suggest was want- c I ing to case his last hours. The wintry night f< had fairly set in, when the inevitable hour e came. Without, sleighs were running to and b fro, bearing to Chappaqua, the nearest tele- f< graph station, the latest bulletins, which n , thousands of anxious hearts in the great city y ; near by kept demanding. Within, the daugh- t! i ters and a few others stood near the dying f< . man, who remained conscious and seemingly t rational and free from pain, though too weak y > j to speak. In the adjoining room sat one or il t two warm friends, and the attending physi- y 3 cian. At ton minutes before seven o'clock v r the watchers drew back in reverent stillness f< j from the bedside. The great editor was gone s f in peace, after so many struggles, in honor t 5 after so much obloquy. d t A >Iiiniinotli Ship. I i That the Devastation, the new English ship c 3 of war, is a success, so far as sho has been d i tried, is now admitted. The ponderous mon- g t ster which squats upon the astonished waters t with a dead weight of 10,000 tons, takes any ; ordinary waves with stolid indifference, J whether she receives them end-on, or upon ? t bow, beam, or quarter. The prodigious hill 3 of foam which her stem piles up when under , way, washes, as was expected, clean over * her forward deck, and she is often submerged j. , aft; but her massive mhl-section rides quiet* f ly enough, and those on board her when an3 chored in the rolling tide way at Spithead, 3 say that she was " steadier than the houses T r ashore." She turns with crcat readiness and n 1 in a small circle, and her speed, as proved in s ) six trials along the measured mile, is not only a equal to the promise of lmr designers, hut it 1 exceeds expectation. _ The mighty engines a driving this island of iron with an indicated 0 power of G,509 horses, with seventy-seven 0 , revolutions per minute, got liftecn kuots and v 3 a half out of tho ship, and her mean rate at 0 I full steam is thirteen knots and three-quart- 1 3 crs. Here, therefore, is a craft which is vul- s r nernblo only to a very few guns, has the ? ] swiftness of a mail packet, and tho handit. uess?thanks to her twin screws_0f a tug, a tI while she could utilize those qualities to hurl a j- upon tlio sides of an opponent tho awful force ^ j of all her ten thousand tons moving with tho 4 J j velocity of a spear. On board this remarkablo man-of-war there arc no less than thirty' four distinct and separate engines, and, inij ' deed, tho value which she represents is as . serious as her fighting capacity. What re1 mains to be learned is tho behavior of the s ugly giant in a real Biscay gale ; and wheths cr or no the cul-dcsac which she carries aft i will or will not prove a mistake in a heavy . following sea. With stability assured to 55^ <1 i, with no top gear to set her over, and with c j decks which can bo hermetically sealed, she r t would be safe enough; but whenever she I f does roll, or pitch, or scud, the rivets add fit- 1 tings in her huge body will be shrewdly tried. 1 Except the Russian monitor, Peter the Great, nothing floating could resist or even cbalI lengo such a vessel at once so strong and : swift. The torpedo, no doubt, may yet be so developed as to make the Devastation, and II all her terrible sisters impotent against a de* feuded coast. On the high seas at present x she has no superior. 8 I a | A c ' ?A good many years ago, a Kentuckian went to Cincinnati and drove a cart, at low wages, until lie had saved up $700. With ' this ho bought a large load of coal, which i sank at the lnndiug the night it was delivered, and he had to sell it for $400. The I party who bought it failed before paying for : it, but finally compromised by giving two and a half acres of land for the debt. The land , is now*in the business part of Cincinnati, and ;* is worth over $1,500,000. n ?Not particular?A man who applied to e one of our citizens for help for his destitute r- children, on being asked what he needed, d said he was not particular "if he couldn'tfget >. bread he would take tobacco."

THURSDAY, DECEMBE Two Talca from (he Grata Roma-'< noriim. OF CONFESSION. A certain king, named Asmodeus, estab- j lished an ordinance by which every malefac- j ' tor, taken, and brought before the judge, ; j should distinctly- declare three truths against j 1 which no exception could be taken, or else ' be capitally condemned. If, however, he did J' this, Ins life and property should be safe. It j ' :hanced that a certain' soldier transgressed j ' the law, and fled. lie hid himself in a forest, i ind there committed many atrocities, despoil- : ing and slaying whomsoever he could lay his i i bauds upon. When the judgo of the district ( iscertained his haunt, he" ordered the forest i to be surrounded, and the soldier to be seized, < ind brought, hound, to the seat of judgment. ? 4 You know the law," 6aid the judge. "I ] lo," returned the other: " If I declare three ? inquestionable truths, I shall be free ; but if c lot, I must die."?"True," replied the judge; ] 4 take, then, advantage of the law's clemcn-, :y, or undergo the punishment it awards, vithout delay." " Cause silence to bo kept," said the soldier, undauntedly. His wish bong complied with, he proceeded in the fol- . owing manner: " Tho first truth is this. I , wotest before ye all, that from my youth up, [ have been a bad man." The judge, hear- f ng this, said to the by-standers, 44 He says rue." They answered, 44 Else, he had not ' ?ow been in this situation."?"Go on, then," i laid the judge. "What is the second truth?" , ?441 like not," exclaimed he, 44 the danger- 9 >us situation in which I stand."?44 Certain- 7 y." said the judge, we may credit thee. Now, then, for the third truth; and thou , last saved thy life."?44 Why," he replied, , 4 if I once get out of this confounded place. ' will never willingly re-enter it."?"Amen," . aid the judge. "Thy wit hath preserved , hec; go in peace." And thus In was saved. APPLICATION. c My beloved, the Emporor is Christ. Tho e oldier is any sinner; the jui'ge is a wise con- c essor.

A king had an only son whom he tenderly oved. lie caused a golden applo to be made . it an immense expense, and shortly after its " fabrication, sickened. Finding his end ap- .} >roach, he called to him his son, and spoke ifter the following manner: "My dear son, , f it please God that I should not recover * rom the sickness under which I sufier, on my ? ilessing I charge you travel through town iud country, and take with you the golden 1 pplo which I caused to be made; find out a he greatest fool, and deliver to him that ap- 1 ilo from me." Tho son faithfully promised o execute his parent's wish; and tho king. urning himself toward tho wall, resigned his pirit. A splendid funeral was prepared; a nd, after the interment, the son set out 8 ipon his travels, with the apple in his pos- { ' ession. " lie traversed many countries and kingdoms, 11 nd found abundance of fools, but none whom ie thought quite worthy of the apple. At P ast, he entered a certain province, and ap- 11 iroached its principal city. Observing the * ! ing, very magnificently attended, riding 11 hrough tho streets, he asked various quos- 8' ions respecting the person he saw, and es- -* iccially of the institutions of tho country. * Ie was answered, that, according to their ^ ustom, tho throne was annually vacated; nd that the late possessor, deprived of every 8 onor, was driven into banishment, whero he * icd in obscurity and poverty. The traveler, j;' earing the account, exclaimed, "This is the lan : i nave lound him whom I soughtu nd immediately hastening to the palace, he . ent his knec,aud cried, "Hail, O king! my f' eceasedfather bequeathed to you this golden ! pple in his last will." The king received he gift, and said, "My friend, how can this a e? Your royal father knew nothing of ino, " or have I ever performed any service to im. Why, then, hath he left mo so val- . able a present?"?"The king, my lord," " eplied he, "bequeathed it not more to you " lian to another; but on his blessing," he barged me to bestow it upon the greatest >ol that I could find. And I have now trav- T led through various kingdoms and countries, p ut nowhere have I discovered so exquisite a ti x>l and madman. Therefore, according to u ly sire's command, I resign tho apple to 1? our most gracious Majesty."?"But," said b he king, "on what account do you take me w irafool?"?"I will tell you, my lord," re- S urned tho other. "You are king for one li ear; and then, doomed to poverty and ex- ti e, you perish most miserably. I declare to w ou, I do not believe that there is, in the diole rid, such an instance of egregious G illy.

Let us, then, make provision t or the future. op concord. ^ Two physicians once resided in a city, who ? rero admirably skilled in medicine; inso- v nuch, that all the sick who took their pro- c criptions wero healed; and it thence became p , question with the inhabitants, which of p hem was the best. After a while a dispute a rose between them upon this point. Said c ne, "My friend, why should there be discord >r envy or anger? let us make the trial; and 0 whosoever is inferior in skill shall serve tho u ither."?"Hut how," repliod his friend, "is his to bo brought about?" The first phy- ,j ician answered, "Hear me. I will p^uck out p our eyes, without doing you tho smallest ajury, and lay them before you on the table; y ind when you desire it, I will replace them s ,s perfect and serviceable as they wero be- n ore. If, in like manner, you can perform ^ his, we will then bo esteemed equal, and 8 valk as brethren through the world.

Whereupon, he who made the u imposition took out his instruments, and ex- 0 1 acted the eyes, besmearing tho sockets and he-outer part of the lids with a certain rich lintment. "My dearfriend," said he, "what j lo you perceive?"?"Of a surety," cried the ithtr, "I see nothing.

"Excellently," returned the other; : "nor do I feel the least pain."?"Well, then," continued the lirst, "it now remains for you ? to treat mo in a similar manner."?"I am ready," 8aid the latter. And, accordingly, taking the instruments as the lirst had done, * he smeared the upper and under part of the ? eye with a peculiar ointment, drew out the 1 eyes and placed them upon the table.

At that moment a goat, brows- 1 ing at no great distance, attracted his obser- 1 ration. Instantly be rau to it, drew out one I of its eyes and put it into the place of the i lost orb.

They are called j no he Zuni villages. Each contains probably SP( !,000 people. An intelligent officer, who has jte ieen among them, thus describes them: , They are a race differing essentially from ,vfl ho tribes around them. The Navajos are sbj heirneighbors on the northwest, the Apaches PVI outh. Their physiognomy and their stately un 'earing, as well as their pride of dress, show ( hem to belong to a race far superior to the sj? unrounding tribes. Tho Zuni women are aa, omely. They are remarkable for the mod- jjS st fullness of their dress. They wear skirts V if black woolen cloth, and a scarf gracefully an'( aided over the breast. These goods are of tio heir own make. Their hair, neatty braided, j arms a head-dress. Their houses are clean, gc) nd their cooking is not to be despised. atl( CnARACTEKISTICS OF THE INDIANS. at The Zuni Indians aro moro than half civil?ed. They aro essentially a pastoral people. 0j-| 'hoy have fields of corn, wheat, and vegeta- caj les. They have flocks of sheep and goats. wb 'hey raise horses, horned cattle, and asses. we .'hey corral their stock at night in high stone nclosures. They use all their animals for boi jod, but a fatted ass is their favorite dish. 'hey keep fowls. They spin their own wool , nd weave it. They have a grand frolic at wa lireshing time. Tho grain in sheaf is taken o a broad, flat, rocky place, nnd thirty or b >rty horsemen canter and caper about on r his threshing floor till the grain is well seprated. It is then winnowed by raking the j traw, and tossing tho chaff in the wind. Af- rpg er this they close the day with a general tjK orse-race, after the fashion of our agricul iral fairs. gcr As our diamond-hunters are about to pco- ^ le tin neighboring country, it is interesting joa o know that these Zuni Indians aro friendly no| d white men, and that supplies can be had ^ here. The valley of the Uio Grande is well 0f ettled with Mexican farmers and herdsmen. j-()ri 'hese and the Zunis will make common cause ritli the miners again.st the plundering r ipaclies. m0 The Zuni Indians never make wars of ag- jlai ression. They stand on tho defensive. ^ lut outside Indians fear them, because of mft heir superior organization and means of demse. Therefore their quietude is seldom tr isturbed. bo? Tho well-watered soil is a dark, gravelly gce >ani.

Traces of thr lissionary influence aro evident, but the car: lading faith of the Aztec religion has not wei een changed. It is an error to say they was orship the sun. They worship the Great 1 pirit who resides in that fitting centre of and ght, life, and purity, to which aro invisibly aga aceablo all oarthly blessings, and beyond wit hich even imagination finds no tracings. ere To this earth and its brother worlds the moi reat Spirit is an all-seeing eye, omiscient go nd omnipresent; and although our sight I cnetrates tho universe and scans tens of wrt lillions of star-suns, not one nor all these wrc uns combined stand to us in so intimate and froi s all-creativo and omnipotent relationship erli s the sun, which is father to us alone?and ure ur system knows no other, nor needs to ver >ok beyond.
