THF FOREST REPUBLICAN. J. C. WENS, . Editor 4 PnopmtTO. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5, IPOO Wantkp, a panic, new or socond-haud. Address tlio Democratic reorganization committee. It lias boon noted that independent parties are never proposed by anybody vlio expects lo bo n private iu their ranks. It is certainly hard on the Democrat to have nothing to show Tor all the hard work of the campaign except Webster Dayis and Wellington. Caxada expects a population of 6,000, 0MJ in its census returns next year. Now "York ami Pennsylvania have each more inhabitants tlmu the Dominion. Russia has sent to the United States an agent to study our homestead legisla tion. In its earliest days the Republican party devised the homestead law that has attracted tlio attention of the world. Tiik completion of tho oflicial count in Ohio shows a most remarkable fact, that Bryan's vote in that Stato was cxaclly the same as four years ag , -ITD.SSJ.

The monthly comparativo statement of the government receipt, and expend itures during November, 1000, shows the total receipts to have been $18,311,514, and tho expenditures $ll,U7S,ti(0, leaving a surplus lor the month of $7,iti",$.")4. H.w.i.'s plnraMty of 021 iu this district is tho smallest received by a congressman in the state, this year, and the smallest ever given in this district. The largest congressional plurality was given to Young, iii tho 1th district, Philadelphia, ::s,3is. Speaker Hknoerson, of Iowa, called tho second session of tho 0th Congress to order at at noon Monday. The leaders of tho llouso are prepaiieg to press with gieat vigor tho important business of the session. 'Tho bill for tho reduction of war revenue taxes, the army re-organization hill, tho river and harbor bill, and the several appropriation bills will have the preference. Thh message of President McKinley to congress is given in synoptical form on our first page to-day. It is a document of great moment and importance, dealing as it does ol the many great questions witli which tho nation has been and is constantly being confronted. The excel lent synopsis which wepresontshould be read by all who have the interest of our beloved land at heart. John P. Rockkfellus a-id Andrew Carnegie are tho two richest men in litis couutry perhaps In the world. The for mer's stuck in tho Standard would bring over $200,000,000 in tho market, aud the hitter's stock in the Carnegie company is worth $.'00,1 (JO.Ot'O in cash. They have othor largo Investments in different parts of tho world, and are likely worth some thing like ?30fl,000,000 each. Titrs far all tho Democratic papers of tho stnto rue strongly in favor of fusion with tho insurgent element or tho legis lature on the election ol a Speaker and V. . Senator, with Geo, R. Dixon of Klk county, and Jamas M. Uuftoy of Al legheny, two of tho rankost Democrats In tho staio lor Speaker and Senator, re spectively. Why, of course. But then, the stalwart Republicans will attend to both thoso cases. Tiik report that Kugland is on the side ot tho United States in tho Chinese diffi culty ueed not cause- anv surnriso. The United States' side iu that controversy, as iu ail us other diplomatic dealings, is the 6ide ot intelligence and enlightenment. It is tho tido which is suro to win in tho Chinese affair in tho end, for all the na tions will have to come to it eventually. Tho administration at Washington has scored several diplomatic triumphs in the past two years. Afraid of Hie Caucus. The Philadelphia 1'ress, Postmaster Kcnenu Liiaries iMiiory Smith's paper, the ollicial clearing house or tho insur gent, newspapers of the commonwealth. has editorially declared itolf outside the palo of any and all political parties. Its hatred of Senator M. S. Quay seems to have been responsible for its severance of tho last tio which gave its utterance party significance and party weight. Tho skull and crosshones of political piracy have been hung nt tho masthead. The mask has been removed and its man hunting policy ro-eiHinciatod. In its leading editorial the other day the Press declared : Tha law makes the duty or the legisla ture to floi-i a Unitod States Senator. J hat duty cannot bo performed by a em eus. '1 hero is no la . v even of the party that recognizes tho caucus. This is a new doctrine for an alleged Republican paper to preach. It is one not recognized by Republicans, Demo ciats, Prohibitionists or any other politi cal party yet formad. The Press will certainly not plead ignorance of the fact that party primaries and caucuses are the fundamental principles of pulitical organ izations. It is surely aware of tho fact that tho two groat political parties of tho United States, in very state aud at ev ery legislative suasion, cjucus not only upon the question of a choice for the Uuited States senatorship-when a va cancy exists but also 011 questions of legislation hnd matters or political expe diency. It is also 11 matter or indisputed infor mation to the Press that, in that the greatest of all councils of parlimontary and party law, the Congress of tho United Stales, the Republican and Democratic membors caucus upon all questions of party expediency, organization and leg islation. Tho Press .il-,0 knows that tho indivldiwl participants iu these caucuses a-.' !;... .d by (lie action of tho majority. I: knows tint the member ot Congress wi. i ii. not respect tins solemn obliga--i"ii niii .'oricii tlie res peot of his party ii- oi i,n, s and Ins standing lis a ropre s. ot.i ivoor tiiu people. And still the J'rKt says "there is no law even of tho party which recognizes the caucus." 1 his paper whirh voices the sentiments ol llm Postmaster General, or Senators Flinn and Martin and Mr. Wanamaker, does not represent Col. Guffey the Demo cratic leader, their partner in tho Stale campaign, for he has declared that the Democrats will caucus upofi the Senator ship and legislative matters. Aud further on iu this treasonable edi torial the Press declares: "There is no obligation on the part of any Republican to attend a caucus." Then the editorial leaks. It tells why the caucus is a b .d thing and incidentally admits that the stalwart Republicans will not only con trol the caucus, but also insure the re election of Senator M.S.Quay. The Press says: The man who goes into the Quay cau cus goos in as a Quay man aud not as a Republican. By such an act lie demon strates that he is nothing but a Quay man. No Republican nominated and elected as an anti-Quay man can attend the Quay caucus and bind himself by its decision without betraying his constituents. No Republican who wants to bo free to exercise his own judgment and b st servo the party will put the caucus gag on bis vote. The omen's disfranchises tho con stituencies of the members w ho attend. For a new-paper that contends that "Quay is beaten" the Press certainly ex hibits little confidence in its own predic tions. It shies at tho caucus, and will shy at any determining test of pollitical strength. Pittsburg Cbrm icra'at Gazette, Who "Ye" Is. They say wo are prosperous. Who's we?"

During the coming week, Representa tive Sibloy will join with Representatives Jack, Showalter and Gralm.11 in urging the members of the river and harbor committee to make a laege appropriation for the purpose of extending the slack- water navigation of the Allegheney river. In discussing the situation to-day, Mr. Sibley 6aid : "I shall work to my utmost lo secure the proper recognition for this important stream. I cannot undorstaud why such a grand river khould have been so long neglected. As the Mouongahela river has practically been given everything asked for, and as its industries have all boon opened to commerce, it seems to me tho business interests of Pittsburg and vicinity should join heartily in the move ment to havo the Allegheny river made navigable by means of locks and dams. Tuo Allegheny river is the field of the fulure for the extension of the commerce of Pittsburg. "It is one or the finost rivors iu the state, and senators and representatives who have visited mo at my homo in Franklin have expressed their surprise that congress had not given the attention to it that it should, Sart:ng from Pitts burg early in the day you can ride all day in an express train and not reach the headwaters of tho rivor. Along its banks are millions of acres covoring coal mines, covered with trees and other important interests. Aud its tributaries all flow through the same class of natural wealth. "In my judgment the river should bo mado navigable almost to headwaters, and I feel certain that the advantages that would be thus offered to commerce would more than repay the outlay by the general government; and in addition to the advantages to commerce this nation can never do enough for Pennsylvania, with its noarly 7,000,000 peoplo, an em pire iu itself. Ever since tho formation of the government the people of the State have contributed hundreds of dollars in revenue where they have received cents in appropriation within tho state. Look at the ports of Philadelphia and Erie for instance. Note the government receipts. And now that the improvement of the Delaware. Monongahela and Ohio rivers are well under way, I think wo should insist upon Congress taking .up the slackwater navigation of the Allegheny river and pushing it to completion. I shall urge the comittee on rivers and harbors to use this extension as far as Franklin in the coining bill and 1 am hopeful of success. With slackwater navi gation to Franklin the feasibility ora ship canl from there to Erie via Meadville can then be taken up."
