On this subjoct he says: ~ HT4 proj3S5? of legislation with 4 to the regulation ol business now virtually complete. It has @rati?forth, as we intended, as a .ol?i, -aud leaves no conjecture as what .is to follow. The road at ^ties clear and firm before bust' feju' a road which it can travel ...lout fear or embarrassment, it >tl&.' road to ungrudged, unclouded access. In it every honest man, ev ery man who believes that the public nierest Is part of his own interest, jaywalk with perfect confidence.'' ?fjFefglves out the word that the pro -gram '.is complete and that business "Can now go along without further molestation from Congress. This is indeed a great relief, but we fear that too much damage has already been done to business for it to make an immediate recovery. ?:The tariff legislation was the worst ^aisturberi but Its bad effects have ''Seen- temporarily arrested by the Eu opean war. The closing of the fae ces of Europe, together with the eneral suspension of business there injaccount of the war, and the ex traordinary large orders for war sup plles that are coming to thiB country ire factors which are causing tno ?esumption "of work at many indus ^^IMliSnts, but capital, always timid i'feautious, will not undertake the IWing.of new factories nor the bet ment of old'ones until some as .anco-is given that it will bo afford _la|Teasonable amount of protection Swy.lts product after the war is over, ifwhlch may be in a few months and IwScfiSmay possibly not be for sev lel&Sy^rs; The element of uncertain time of the ending of the l^r'fvriii^^se; investors to'go slowly In starting .''iiny new business that would be a_ fted by the termination i$>^tfie war.

Many Democratic leaders, and Norman E.

Bernard Shaw has not perhaps a well' balanced lnUllectf but- he hashls peculiar uses,'due to'a keen nose "for the detection o( /hypocrisy/ and hum bug. As a puncturer .of comfortable Ui&ma G. Bernard has few rivals. At tho present time he chides England, Germany and other Christian Powers, Austrian and Russia to wit, for not closing their churches while the inter national orgy of murder is on. The pagans of old Rome were moro con sistent for when they drew the sword they closed the Temple of Peace. Mod ern powers are strictly pagan, not Christian. Their people would be Christian If they ruled, but they are overruled by unmotal governments concerned only with national rapacity and greed. But while the Powers are hopelessly pagan, they have not the honesty of Paganism of the old school. Thoy keep up the pitiable pretense of being representative of their peo plo and Christian. Tho proper penalty to inflfct on these relics of savagery Is take power away from thorn and let the people rule." THE 

PHONE MERGER We do not know what prospect there is for tho abolition of one of tho telephone companies In Fairmont] as our credentials do not carry us through the portals of the domiciles of "Big Business" nor into the sanc tums of the Potentates of special [irlvlege, and this is not saying that either of the two local telephone com-, panies are enjoying special privilege to an obnoxious degree or that the West Virginian has any grievance with either company, but we do say that such a plan would be a most econ omical one for the telephone users. Two local telephone lines have the ef fect of doubling telephone rates by lequlrlng everybody with any business to transact to put In both phones when under a consolidation ono phone would answer tho purpose better than the two. A monopoly of any public service was formerly a danger ous thing in tills state as tho ser vice might be allowed to deteriorate and the prices go up but with the Fubllc Service Commission to protect the people there is little danger, if any danger of such things happen ing. With one phone line the service should be impro"ed at a .lower rate owing to the reduction in the operat ing expenses. ' The chamber of commerce will dis cuss this question tonight and it is to be hoped that some plan will be evolved to bring about a consolidation of tho two lines. The man who really Is willing to be gin at the bottom u&ually stays there. It isn't the competition of woman that threatens the average man. It Is tho pTice at which women are will- j in gto compete. Except in the case of a gool looking j woman the most popular verdict is the j ono that finds tho defendant guilty. SENATOR WHITE, EDITOR. Senator Geo. E. White, It is reported, has become the now owner of tho Wen ton Independent, the able weekly which has been conducted by R. Ad. Hall for the past twenty years. Mr. Hall has made the Independent an effective weapon for the people and tho paper is among the strongest of the weekly papers of the state, but under the man agement of Senator White the paper will lose none of Its virility and staunch republicanism. WHAT'S THE USE! What's the use of the Preston News and the Klngwoort Argus printing any papers at all? Why not just have tho State Journal sent out to their sub 'scrlbers and bo done with It??Parkers burg State Journal. A good suggestion. The way the State Journal was quoted in the Pres ton county papers last week is enough to make all the other editors of the state green-eyed with Jealousy. "FESSED UP" Tho Parkersburg Sentinel Is one lo ranger" on us. The old codger has at last been located.

Ho possi bly has as many readers as any news paper writer of tho present time. Ev erywhere tho Cincinnati Enquire cir culates, and that Is over a wide area of tho middle west, Luke McLuke is a favorite, and his paragraphs are be ing copied by hundreds of daily and weekly newspapers all over tho coun try.
