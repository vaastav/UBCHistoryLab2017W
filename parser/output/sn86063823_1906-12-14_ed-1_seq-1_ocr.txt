Professor Matthews, of Columbia University, chairman of the executive commit tee of - the simplified spelling board, declined to comment last night on President Roosevelt's action yester day afternoon regarding the new spelling. Yesterday Representative Landis called on the President in re gard to the reformed spelling, and the President agreed to withdraw his order to the public printer in case the house would go on record against the system. Accordingly, Landis in troduced a resolution favoring the old method, and the house passed it unanimously. Matthews said he had refused to comment on the Pres ident's original order, and must re fuse to criticise the President's ac tion now. He stated, however,, that the system of reformed spelling was daily gaining friends both in this country and in England. ' o Christmas Trees. They are - here now.

A special aispatca to the Record-Herald from Washington says: A special message on xne Japanese Question and Call fornia school problem supplementary to the treatment of these subjects Dy President Roosevelt in his regu lar message last week, will be sent to congress from the White House next Tuesday. - It is stated authoritativelv that this special message will be more vigorous in tone than the former communication, and will not be cal culated to cool the indignation of the Californians. The special mes sage, moreover, aside from its local application, will be one of the most notable and important communica tions in the entire list of those sent to congress by the present Execu tive. It will bring to a direct issue a centralization scheme hich will likely form the climax of endeavor on the part of the Roosevelt admin istration. The administration isl al leged to take advanced ground regard ing the doctrine of Federal suprem acy over state sovereignty. The Japanese question raised in connection .with the school problem of California has supplied the oppor tunity to give forcible expression to a . mighty scbeme of centralization that is to be ca' ed out if possible. .It is not po. il-ie to forecast the details of wha . the President will say In his second message, which is understood to be an explanation of the administration's projected policy as to the supremacy of Federal con trol over state power, and will in clude the report of the special inves tigation of the San Francisco school question made by Secretary of Com merce and Labor Metcalf. Regardless of the nature of his report, the Pres ident will adhere vigorously to the position taken by him in his regular message. As to Metcalf's report it has been learned its author found much to condemn in the - matter - of treatment of the Japanese outside of the school question. It will show, it is under stood, that labor union tyranny over tne Japanese affects the rights held to be theirs by treaty in even a more pronounced manner than anything connected with the school imbroglio. Matters of this nature in Metcalf's report will furnish the key for many arguments to 'be advanced by the President , in his message. New Copyright Books P. V. D. Co. TEN PER

The first day of the regime of separation of church and state passed without grave dis orders. Public interest in the details of the continuation of the struggle is already flagging. It is now apparent that the resistance of the clergy will be purely passive, and there is no prospect of religious passions being aroused unless the churches ' are closed. The government is there fore resting on its oars, and will con tinue to do so until the parliament authorizes, the drastic measure which the cabinet is preparing.

ROOSEVELT THE FORE RUNNER OF BRYAN. ' Guthrie, O. T., Dec. 14. In ad dressing 'the Oklahoma Constitution al convention today, Hon. Oscar B. Colquitt, a member of the Texas rail road commission, declared that rail road rate regulation in Texas has been a failure except in producing uniformity, and he quoted Mr. May field of the same commission as ac knowledging that it had been almost a failure. Commenting on the effort of President Roosevelt, Mr. Colquitt said that if strong 'men were kept on the Interstate Commerce Commis sion and the courts did not nullify their work, the Hepburn " rate bill might ' satisfy the people. Otherwise he believed that Roosevelt would be the "forerunner of Bryan." . Colquitt was an advocate of rail- road regulation in Texas -when the cause was championed by the late Governor Hogg. He is the first prom inent man in public life in Texas to declare it has been a , failure in re sults. ' The Woman's Club entertainment tonight begins at 8 o'clock sharp.
