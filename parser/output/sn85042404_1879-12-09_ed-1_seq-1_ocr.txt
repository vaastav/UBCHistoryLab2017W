JAMESTOWN, STUTSMAN COUNTY, D. T, DECEMBER 9 1879. NO 20 THE HPEXCEK WAVE, It is apparent that the Spencer "gang' does not admire the President's message, which by the way is not surprising, since it contains a greater amount of common sense than the majority of his illustrious followers are capable of digesting. A leading editorial in the Fargo Daily Argus, of the 4th inst., headed "The Annual Message." is a fair sample of the stock of brains, Spencer has employed to prepare the way for his coming. We would take occasion to say if Spencer ever expects to gain any prominence in Dakota politics, the best move he can make is to put split sticks on the tails of his present hirelings and secure anew and more in­ telligent set of monkeys to crank his organs. The Argus is a good newspaper, but it had better wait until it is old enough to run alone before it commences to buck against the Union.
