PAGE TEN THE RICHMOND PALLADIUM AND SUN-TELEGRAM, TUESDAY, DEC. 2, 1919. ALL BUSINESS IS TO CLOSE AT 5 Every store, business house, pool room, and other establishment, except theatres, was ordered closed ai i'Ureseiit at the opening of this session o'clock in the afternoon, and factories , the tongre!iS. i am thus prevented were ordered closed at 4:30. at a meet-: roii.,ini, na drprt a wav as ing of the city officers in tht- city hl Tuesday afternoon. The order lanes effect Wednesday, and is due to the-j coal shortage. Representatives of stores, factories, and banks were present. James Dil lon, superintendent of the city light plast, said that the city was extremely "hard up" for coal. Pillon illustrated the situation here and the stringent steps which may have to be taken by describing those in other cities. COURT TO DECIDE IF DRINK'S NO PRINK " NEW YORK, Dec. 2 "When is a drink not a drink?" another conun drum bred of prohibition, was sprung in the supreme court here today. The answer to this is "when it is taken at mea's for food or alimentary purposes at home, hotels and restaurants." This conclusion was made by coun sel for Howard Major of this city, a stockholder in the American Malt and Grain company, a $13,000,000 concern, in a suit brought against erstwhile di rectors, combatting their action in selling out at a loss to another corpo ra,on. The plaintiff asserted that if they had obtained "competent legal advice, they would have "known" that Hie words "beverage purposes" in the Federal prohibition amendment did not mean "total prohibition." Major's counsel explained that by legal, economic and physiological def inition, "beverage purposes," as used in said amendment means drinking be tween meals, for tippling purposes and for pleasure only, at th bars and in saloons, and lhat restaurants will in a very short time be enabled to sell liquor. Justice Lazansky remark ed that if the definition of the term "beverage purposes" must be gone in to, he desired time to do it, and asked for briefs.

President's Message to Congress Following is a partial text of Presi dent Wilson's message to congress to day. To the senate and house of repres entatives: I sincerely regret that I cannot be j could wish the mauy questions that iare pressing for solution at this time, Happily j have had the advantage of the advice of heads of the several executive departments who have kept in close touch with affairs in their de tail and whose thoughtful recommen dations I earnestly second. In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs, growing out of federal control, 1 shall take the liberty at a later day of ad dressing you. 1 hope that congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation looking to the? establishment of a budg- t system. That thert should be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not in dependently of each other, but with reference to one single comprehensive plan of expenditure properly related to' the nation's income, there can be no doubt. I believe the burden of pre paring the budget must, in the nature of the case, if the work Is to be prop erly -done and responsibility concen trated instead of divided, rest upon the executive. The budget so pre pared should be submitted to and ap proved or amended by a single com mittee of each house of congress and no single appropriation should be made by the congress, except such as may have been included in the budget prepared by the executive or added by the particular committee of congress charged with the budget legislation. "Another and not less important aspect of the problem is the ascer tainment of the economy and efficien cy with which the moneys appropriat ed are expended. Under existing law the only audit is for the purpose, of ascertaining whether expenditures have been lawfully made wkhin the appropriations. No Ce is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, econ omically and effectively. The audit ors should be highly trained officials with permanenet tenure in the treas ury department free of obligations to or motives of consideration for this or any subsequent administration, and authorized and empowered to examine into and make report upon the meth ods employed and the results obtained "'' j iu.. aiIU "i i" uunosi im- i'1 i-aucc mai ill urtti tug w 1111 

LUIS matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for the calendar year 1920, payable in the calendar year 1921. Tr.e congress might well consider whether the high er rates of income and profits taxes can in peace times be effectively pro ductive of revenue, and whether they may not. on the contrary, be destruc tive ef business activity and produc tive of waste and inefficiency. There is a point at which in peace times high rates of income and profits taxes discourage energy- remove the incen- dustrial stagnation with consequent unemployment and other attendant evils. The problem is not an easy one. A fundemental change has taken place with reference to the position of America in the world's affairs. The prejudice and passions engendered by decades of controversy between two schools of political and economic thought the one believers in protec- tion of American industries, the other I believer in tariff for revenue only j must be subordinated to the single i consideration of the public interest in i the light of utterly changed condi i tions. Before the war America was i heavily the debtor of the rest of the I world and the interest payments she : had to make to foreign countries on j American securities held abroad, the expenditures of American travelers . , ', ,n nav trl nlW :ihnllt hnl. jtifPfl tho vet !ii a of hsr nra-wn r favnr. . . hnlan..0 nf trnf, Unrinsr th wnr Americas exports have been greatly stimulated, and increased prices have increased their value. On the other hand, she has purchased a large pro portion of the American securities previously held abroad, has loaned some $9000,000,000 to foreign govern ments, and has built her own ships. Our favorable balance of trade has thus been greatly increased and Eu rope has been deprived of the means of meeting it, heretofore existing. Europe can have only three ways of meeting the favorable balance of trade i in peace times: By imports into this 'country of gold or of goods, or by es- . abiishing new credits. Europe is in ! no position at the present time to ship i gold to us nor could we contemplate large further imports of gold into this I country without concern. The time ! has nearly passed for international i srnvernmental loans and it will take time to develop in this country a mar- therefore which would tend to pre vent foreign countries from settling for our exports by shipments of goods into this country could only have the effect of preventing them from paying for our exports and therefore of pre venting the exports from being made. The oroductivitv of the country great- tries and any measures taken to prevent imports will inevitably curtail exports, force curtailment of produc tion, load the banking machinery of the country with credits to carry un sold products and product industrial stagnation nd unemployment. If we want to sell, w must be prepared to buy. Whatever, therefore, may have been our views during the period of growth of American business concern ing tariff legislation, we must now ad just our own economic life to a changed condition growing out of the fact that American business is full grown and that America is the great est apitalist in the world. Can Not Isolate U. S. No policy of isolation will satisfy the growing needs and opportunities of America. The provincial standards and policies of the past which have held American business as if in a strait-Jacket, must yield and give way to the needs and exigencies of the new dayin which we live, a day full of hope and promise for American busi ness, if we will but take advantage of the opportunities that are ours for the asking. The recent war has ended our Isolation and thrown upon us a great duty and responsibility. The United States desires for Itself only equal opportunity with the other na tions of the world, and that through the process of friendly co-operation and fair competition the legitive in terests of the nations concerned may be successfully and equitably adjusted. There are other matters of import ance upon which I urged action at the last session of congress which are still pressing for solution. I am sure it is not necessary for me again to re mind you that there is one immediate and very practicable question result ing from the war which we should meet in the most liberal spirit. It is a matter of recognition and relief to our soldiers. I can do no better than to quote from my Jast message urging this very action. "We must see to it that our return ing soldiers are assisted in every practicable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country. This can be done by developing and maintaining upon an adequate scale tne admirable or ganization created by the department of labor for placing men seeking work; and it can also be done, in at least one very great field, by creating now opportunities for individual enter prise-. The secretary of the interior has pointed out the way by which return ing soldiers may be helped to find and take up land in the hitherto unde veloped regions of the country which the federal government lias already prepared or can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the cut-over or neglected areas which lie ! within the limits of the older states: I and I once more take the liberty of ; recommending very urgently that hi'i plans shall receive the immediate and ! :uibstantial support of the congress." I In the matter of tariff legislation. I ! beg to call your attention to the state J nients contained in my last message, (urging legislation with reference to the establishment of the chemical and dyestuff industry in America. "Among the industries to which special -consideration should be given is that of the -manufacture of dye- j stuffs and related chemicals. Our ! complete dependence upon (Herman j supplies before the war made the I interruption of trade a cause of ex I ceptional economic disturbance. The close relation between the manufac ture of dyestuffs, on the one hand, and of explosives and poisonous gases on the other, moreover, has given the industry an exceptional significance and value. Although the United j States will gladly and unhesitatingly j join in the program of international j disarmament, it will, nevertheless, be I a policy of obvious prudence to make j certain of the successful maintenance ! of many strong and well equipped chamical plants. The German chemi- cal industry, with which we will be brought into competition, was and may well be again, a thoroughly knit mon- jopoly capable of exercising a compe- tition of a peculiarly insidious and dangerous kind. During the war the farmer per - formed a vital and willing service to the nation. By materially increasing the production or his land, he sup plied America and the allies with the increased amounts of food necessary i to keep their immense armies in the j field. He indispensably helped to ! j win the war. But there is now scarce-1 ly less need of increasing the produc-; tion in food and the necessaries of I I life. I ask the congress to consider! these lines. The importance of doing everything possible to promote pro duction along economical lines, to im prove marketing, and to make rural life more attractive and healthful, is obvious. I would urge approval of the plans already proposed to the con gress by the secretary of agriculture, I to secure the essential facts required 1 for the proper study of this question, through the proposed enlarged pro ' grams for farm management studies and crop estimates. I would urge,

Political Restlessness. I would call your attention to the widespread condition of political rest lessness in our body politic. The causes of this unrest, while various and complicated, are superficial rath er than deep seated. Broadly, they arise or are connected with the fail ure on the part of our government to arrive speedily at a just and perma nent peace permitting return to nor mal conditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething European centers, pending such de lay, from heartless profiteering re sulting in the increase of the cost of living, and lastly from the machina tions of passionate and malevolent agi tators. With the return to normal conditions, this unrest will rapidly dis appear. In the meantime, it does; much evil. It seems to mo that ini dealing with tills' situation congress I should not be impatient or drastic, but should seek rather to remove the C-auses. It shou d endeavor to hrinz our country back speedily to a peace basis with ameliorated' living cx)ndi - tions under the minimum of restric - tions upon personal -liberty that is consistent with our reconstruction problems. And it should arm the fed - eral government with power to deal'"' oln(,r m"c neeoea reforms in its criminal courts with those per- ,n thr business of interstate shipment j sons who by violent methods would abrogate our time-tested institutions, With the free expression of opinion and wilh thP artvnPHcv nf nrHoriv rmtit. ical change, however fundamental, there must be no interference, but to wards passion and malevolence tend ing to incite crime and 'insurrection under guise of political evolution there should be no leniency. Legisla tion to this end has been recommend ed by the attorney general and should be enacted. In this direct connection I would call your attention to my recommen dations on August 8, pointing out leg islative measures which would bo effective in controlling and bringing down the present cost of living which contributed so largely to this unrest. On only one of these recommenda tions has the congress acted. If the government's campaign is to be effec tive it is necessary that the other steps suggested should be acted on at once. I strongly urge the necessity of the extension of the present food control act as to the period of time in which it shall remain in operation. The attorney-general has submitted a bill providing for an extension of t.s act for a period of 6 months. As it now stands it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal proclama tion of peace. It is imperative that it should be extended at once. The department of justice has built up ex tensive machinery for the purpose of enforcing its provisins; all of which must be abandoned upon the conclu 1 &ion of peace unless the provisions of , this act are extended. j Ak. r.r,..

Some such regulation is imperatively necessary. The hold ing of foodstuffs and other necessar ies of life cannot otherwise be effec tively prevented.
