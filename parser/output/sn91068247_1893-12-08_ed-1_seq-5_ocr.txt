favorable conditions, aid this consum mation. It soims to me, however, that allotments of land in severalty ought to be made wi' h great care and circumspec tion. Oar Indians number about 243,000. Most of tlem are located on 161 reserva tions, containing 86,116 531 acres of land. About 110,00) of these Indians have to a large degree, adopted civilized customs. Lands in severalty have been allotted to many of them. Such allot ments have been made to 110,000 indi viduals during the last fiscal year, em bracing 1.000,000 acres The number of Indian government schools open during the year was 195, an increase of 12 over the preceding year. Of this total 170 are on reservations, of which 73 were beard ing, schools and 07 were day schools. The solution of the Indian problem depends very largely upon good administration. The personal fitness of agents ami their adaptability to the pe culiar duty of caring for their wards is of the utmost importance. ' Army officers are recommended for In- linn ftDOntO Thn onnvAnria. lions on accouct of the Indian Bureau , for the year ending JuneSO, 1894, amount to $7 954 963 99, a decrease as compared with, the year preceding It of $387,131 95. TUB PtTBtIC LAHDB AND THfi'BPECULATOR The vast area of land which, but a fchoTttime ago, constituted the public uem-ain, is Tapiaiy railing into private, hands It is certain that in the transfer the beneficent intention of the govern ment to -supply from its domain, vhomea to the industrious and wqjtfay home seekers is often frustratedtfThough tne speculator, who fctaujitf'with extortion ate purpose betwecrf the land office and" those wholwrttfthtir families, are in vited ba&rgovernment to settle on the pubjrfands, is a despicable character, no ought not to be tolerated, yet it is difficult to thwart his schemes. The recant opening to settlement of the Cher okee Outlet,; embracing an area of 6,500,000 acres, notwithstanding the ut most care in framing the regulations gov erning the selection of locations, and notwithstanding the presence cf the United States troops, furnished an ex hibition, though perhaps in a modified degree, of tne mad scramble, the vio lence, and the fraudulent occupation which have accompanied previous open ings of public land. I concur with the Secretary in the belief that these out rageous incidents cannot be entirely pre vented without a change in the laws on the subject, and I hope his recom mendation t in that direction will be fa vorabiy considered. I simply commend to the attention of the Cod gr ess the statements contained in the Searetary's reports concerning fores try. The time has come when tffleient measures should ba taken for the preser vation of our forests from indiscriminate and remediless destruction. The report of the Secretary of Agri culture will be found exceedingly inter esting, especially to that large part of our citizens intimately concerned in agricul tural occupations. On the 7 th day of March, 1893, there were upon the pay rolls of the Agricultural Depart ment 2,430 employos. This num ber has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a dep'eted Treasury and the imperative demand of the people for conomy in the administration of their government, the Secretary Las entered upon the task of rationally re ducing expenditures by the elimination from the pay rolls of all persons not needed for an efficient conduct of the af fairs of the department . Durin g the fi rst quarter of the present year the expenses of the department aggregate $ 345,876 76 as against $402,012.42 for the correepond- : w. : T on i on a rri c iiiK jcu cuumiiiiuijti ou, iovo iuu sec retary makes apparent his intention to continue this rate of reduction by sub mitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by $994,280 than those for the pres- Among the heads of divisions in this department the changes have been ex ceedingly few. Three vacancies occur ring from death and resignations have been filled by the promotion of assistants in the Bams divisions. These promo tions of experienced and faithful assist - ants have not only been in the interest of ifficient work, but have suggested to thos e in the department who look fur re election end promotion, merit and devo tion to duty as their best reliance. Texas fever and stock ytrd infectious diseases have been few the past year. Much attention has been paid to correct ing the causes inducing disease among cattle and animals of all descriptions. The exports of American cattle show a falling off of 25 per cent from the preced ing year. The President recommends with the Secretary of Agriculture that all employes in the Bureau of Animal In dustry be graduates of vetei inary colleges The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30 h, 189?. attained the enor mous figure of $800,000,000 in round num bers, being 78.7 per cent, of our total ex ports la the last fiscal year this aggre gate was greatly reduced, bat neverthe less reached $615 000,000, being 75 1 per cent, or an American commodities ex ported. A review of our egricltural ex ports, with special reference to their destination, will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Briuia and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion of cattle. The total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending June SOih, 1893, $26,000 000, of which Great Britain took considerablv over $25,000,000 of beef products of ail kie'ds. Our total exports were $28,000.- 000, of which Great Britain tcols $24,000, 000 The work of the statistical division of the Department of Agriculture deals with all that relates t o the economics of farming. The main purpose of its monthly reports is to keep the farmers informed as fully as possible of all mat ters having any influence upon the world's markets in which their products fia-J sale. Its publications re late especially to the commercial side of farming. It is therefore of profound interest and vital concern to the farmers of the United States, who represent nearly one hajf of cur population, and also of direct interest to the whole coun try that the work of this division be ef ficiently performed and that the infor matlon it has gathered be promptly dif fused It is matter of congratulation to know that the Secretary will not spare any effort to make this part of his work thoroughly useful. THE 

ABUSE OF THE SEED BUSINESS. In the year 1839, the Congress appro priated $1,000 to be taken from the Patent Office fund for the purpose of collecting and distributing rare and im proved variety of seeds, and for prosecut ing agricultural investigations and pro curing agricultural Etatistics. From this f mall beginning the seed division of the Department of Agriculture has grown to its present unwielding and ur justifiably extravagant proportions. Daring the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased waB -$66,548 61. The remainder of an appropriation of $135,000 was expended putting them up and distributing them. It surely never could have entered the minds of those who first sanctioned ap propriations of public money for the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds for gratuitous distribution that from this would spring such large ap propriations for the purchase and distri bution by members of Congress of ordi nary seeds, bulbs and cuttings, which are common in all the States and Territories, and everywhere easily obtainable at low prices. Ia each State and Territory an agricul tural experiment station has been estab lished. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper agen cies to experiment with and test new Va rieties of seeds, and yet this indiscrimin ate and wasteful distribution by legisla tion and legislators answers no purpose, unless it be to rem.nd constituents that their Representatives are willing to re member them with gratuities at public cost. Under the sanction, of existing legislation there was sent out from the Agricultural Department during the last fiscal year enough of cabbage seed to plant 19.200 acres cf land, a sufficient quantity of beans to plant 4 000 acres, beet seed enough ' to plant 2,500 acres, sweet corn enough to plant 7,800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,025 acres with vines and enough muskmelon and watermelon seeds to plant 267 acrea. The total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus distributed was con tained in more than nine million pack ages, and they were sufficient, if planted, to cover 88,596 acres of land. In view of these facts, that enormous expenditure without any returns of ben efit ought to be abolished. Anticipating a consummation so manifestly in the in terest of good administration'more than $100,000 has been stricken from the esti mate made to cover this object for the year ending June 30lh, 1895, and the Sec retary recommends tha the remaining $35,000 of the estimate bo conflaed strict ly to the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds and that these be dis tributed through experiment . stations. Thus the seed will be tested and after the test has been completed by the expe riment station the properties of the use ful varieties and the rejection of the val ueless may safely be lelt to the people. 

CIVIL BEBVICE BEFORM. The continued intelligent execution of the civil service law, and the increasing approval by the people of its operation, are most gratifying. The recent exten sion of its limitations and regulations to the employes at free delivery postofflces, which has been .honestly and promptly accomplished by the commission, witn the hearty co-operation of the Postmas ter General, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system. I am, if possible, more than ever con vinced of the incalculable benefits con ferred by the civil service law not only in its effect upon the public service, but also, what is even more important, in its effect in elev&ting'the tone of political life generally. I ne course or civt I service reform ;in this country instructively and interest ingly illustrates how strong a hold a movement gains upon our people, which has underlying it a sentiment of justice and right and which at the same time prtmUes better administration of their government. The law embodying this reform found its way to our statue book more from fear of the popular sentiment existing in its favor than from any love for the reform itself. Once a part of legislation, and it has lived and grown ami flourished in spite of the covert as well as open hostility of spoilsmen, and notwithstanding the querulous impracticability of many self constituted guardians. Beneath all the vagaries and sublimated theories which are tttracted toit.there underlies this re form a sturdy common sense principle, net OLly suited to this mundane ephere, but whose application our people are more and more recognizing to ba abso lutely essential to the most successful operation of their government, if not to its perpetuity It seems to me to be en tirely inconsistent with the character of this reform, as well as with its best en forcement, to oblige the commission to rely for cleric il assistance upon clerks detailed from other departments. There ought not to be such a condition in any department that clerks hired to do worn there can be spared to habitually work at another place; and it does net accord with a sensible view of civil service re form that persons should be employed on the theory that their labor is necessary in one department when in point of fact their services are devoted to entirely dif ferent work in another department. I earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to carry on the work of the commission be regularly put upon its roster, and that the system of obligating the commission ers to rely upon the services of clerks be longing to other departments be discon tinued. ECONOMY IS NECK8SABT. This ought not to increase the expense to the government, while it would cer tainly be more consistent nd add great ly to the efficiency of the commi.son. Economy in public expenditure ia a duty that canno: innocently Joe neg'ected by those intrusted with the control of money drawn from the pcop-lj for public uses. It must be confessed ttu.t emr apparently endles3 resou;ce9, the familiarity of our people with immerse accumulations of wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the expenditure of public money should in some manner be to their immedibt3 and personal advantage, the indirect and slmost stealthy manner in which a large part of our taxes are exact ed, and & degenerated eense of official ac countability have led to growing extrav agance in governmental appropriation at this time when a depleted public treas ury confronts us, when many of our own people are engaged ia a hard struggle for the necessaries of life and when enforced economy is pressing on the great masscf our countrymen, I deEire to urge with all the earnestness at my command that con gressional legislation be so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an apprecia tion of the condition of the treasury and a sympathy with the straitened circum stances of our fallow citizaas. The duty of public economy ia also of im mense importance ia its intimate and necessary rrlation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to meet gov ernmental expenditures, and yet reducing tne people s uuraen or taxation. TARIFF REFORM. After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. .Nothing so impor tant claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents itseii as ootn an opportu ulty and a duty; an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our leJlow-citizens, and a duty imposed upon us by oft repeated professions and by the emphatic mandate of the people. After full discussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of this refe r m,ind 1 hey have confi 2ed the work c f its accomplishment to the hands or tnosa who are solemnly pledged to it. If there is anything in tne theory or a represen tatioa in public places of the people, and if public officers are really the ser vants or the people and ir political prom ises and professions have any binding force, cur failure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Noth ing should intervene to distract our at tention or disturb our effort until this re form is accomplished by wise and care ful legislation. While we should staunch ly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justifies the imposi tion of tariff duties and other Federal taxation, and that they should Delimited by strict economy, we cannot close cur eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up smong us which in justice and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxa tion as the emergencies of our govern ment actually demand. REDUCE TAXES ON THE NECESSARIES OP LIFE. Manifestly, if we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform one of the most obvious features should be a reduc tion in present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The benefits of such a reduction would be palpable and sub stantial, Been and felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the willing benefactions of a govern ment whose highest function is the pro motion of the welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our people's pros perity and well-being is the removal of restrictions upon the import of raw ma terials necessary to our manufactures. The world should be open to our national ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot be while Federal legisla tion, through the imposition of a high tariff, forbids the American manufactur ers as cheap materials as those used by their competitors. It is quite obvious that the enhancement of the price of our manufactured products, resulting from this policy, not only confines the market for these products within our own bor ders to the direct disadvantage of our manufacturers, but also it-creases their cost to our citizens. THE 

INTERESTS OF LABOR are certainly though indirectly involved in this feature of our tariff system. The sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their goods soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of work in mills and factories; a discharge of employes, and distress in the homes of our workingmen. Even if the often dis proved assertion could be made good that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw material and low tariff duties, the intelligence of our working men leads them quickly to discover that their steady employment, permitted by free raw material, is the most important factor in their relations to tariff legisla t.ion THE WILSON BILL. A measure has been prepared by the proper congressional committee em bodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly sub mitted for legislation. It is the result of much patriotic and unselfish work, and I believe it deals with its subject as consistently and as thoroughly as exist ing conditions permit. I am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed legislation, added to existing internal revenue taxation, will, in the future, though perhaps net imme diately, produce snfficent revenue to meet the needs of the government. THE INCOME TAX. The committee, after full considera tion, and to provide against a' temporary deficiency which may exist before the business of the country a justs itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely em braced in their plaa a few additional in ternal revenue t axe?, including a Bmall tax upon incomes derived from certain corporate investments These new as sessments are not only absolutely just and easily bcrne, but they have the further merit of being su ;h as can be re mitted, without unfavorable business disturbance, whenever the necessity for their imposition no longer exists. In my great desire for the success of the measure, I cannot restrain the sug gestion that its success can only be at tained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform, and as a result oi tneir willingness to subordinate personal desires and ambi tions to the general good, I he local interests affected by the proposed re form are so numerous and so varied that if ail are insisted upon the legislation embodying the reform must inevitably fail. In conclusion, my intense feeling of responsibility impels me to invoke for the manifold interests oi a generous ana confiding people, the most scrupulous care to pieege my willing support to ev ery legislative effort for the advance ment of the greatness and prosperity of our beloved country.

There Was a Delay In the Message Reach- Ins; the Chamber Its Reading Did Mot Kxeite Unnaaal Attention Senator Dolph GItcs Motlee of a Speech on the Hawaiian Question Many Bill and Resolutions Introduced The Senate Ad journs in Bespect to the Memory ot Messrs. O'Neill and Lilly. Washington, Dec. 4 At the outset of the proceedings of the new leaders of the Senate, changed relations of parties came immediately to the front. The chaplain's "amen" had scarcely died away before Mr. Cockrcll, chairman of the committee of appropriations, was on his feet to move the customary resolution to notify the Mouse that tne Senate was ready for business. Mr. Sherman toot tne lead on the other side of the chamber by suggesting that a call of the roll was first in order. This point being admitted to be well taken, the clerk called the roll, and 56 answered to their names. Three other Senators subsequently CLtered the cham ber, making 59 present out of a total of 85 with three vacancies. Messrs. Mcrherson and bberman were designated as the Senate members of a oint committee 01 tne senate and House to wait upon the President and notify mm 01 tne organization or ootn bodies. Tnen upon motion of Mr. Harris, the Senate took a recess of one hour. At 10 the Senate resumed its sesdon, but the message from the President not hav ing been received, a further recess of 20 minutes was taken. When the Senate again resumed its session, Mr. McPher son announced the intention of the President to immediately communicate to both houses of Congress a "message in writing." Assistant Private secretary Pruden emerged from the cloak room where he had been in seclusion for nearly ten min utes, and a doorkeeper announced "a message from the President of the United States." Secretary Cox immedi ately entered upon its reading. There was a general air of respectful attention manifested on both sides of the Senate. As the reading of the message proceeded and it was found to ba so far different from what high strung expectation had anticipated, the interest manifested in its contents perceptibly diminished. The reading progressed quietly and unevent fully until the end, and then Mr. Dolph rose and inquired whether the copies of the message, which had been laid upon the desks of Senators, were the same as that from which the secretary had read. He was prompted to do so because te noticed that ih the reading no reference was made to Hawaiian affairs or to any of the matter upon a certain page cf the printed message. The omis sion having thus been called to the atten tion of the Senate, the Vice President directed the secretary to read the page. which was done. The point of Mr. Dolph's inquiry was made clear then, for he immediately gave notice that to-morrow, after the morning hour, he should ask the Senate to indulge him in a few remarks on that point of the mecsage which referred to Hawaii. A number of reports were read and a arge number of bills and resolutions were introduced and referred to appro priate committses. A message was received from tne House announcing the death of Charles O'Neill and William Lilly, late Represen tatives from Pennsylvania. Mr. Cameron offered resolutions expressive of the sor row of the senate, which were adopted, and as a further mark of reBpcct, the Sen ate at 3:55 ad ourned. A Deolsion Affecting Trade-Marks, Washington, Dec. 4 An interesting application of the trade-mark law was made by the United Btates Supreme Court to day in the case of the uolumbla Mill Company, of Columbia, Pa , against W. W. Alcorn, in which the Circuit Court for eastern Pennsylvania refused to pro tect the former in its claim to exclusive proprietorship of the word "Columbia" as a trade-mark on flours. This court, by Justice Jackson, sustains that ruling. It says tnat in order to sustain exclusive use to a name, device or symbol it mnst be t ne which will identify origin or own ership and cannot consist of words of common use as designating locality.

At last bis weary walk is done. He pauses at tne river's brink. .ind drinks the while his drivers drink Almost beside the setting sun. Cy Warm an, in McClure's Magazine for De cember, THE HOUSE REALLY LISTENED WHEN the CUBE BEAD the MESSAGE. Although it Took an Hoar and Twenty Minutes, the Restless Lower Hons of Cons-rets Sat Quiet the Whole Time Mr. Sayers' Resolution Prorldlng for Additional Bevtnue Officers to Carry Out the Geary Law Was Adopted Mr. Hlnes Called Down Adjournment la Bepect to the Two Lately Deceased PennsjlTanians. Washington, Dec 4 The House was called to order promptly at noon, and 243 members answered to their names. During the roll call, a message was received from the Senate announc ing the organization of that body. Oa motion of Mr. Wilson, of West Virginia, the following committee was appointed to wait upon the President: Messrs. Wilson, Outhwaite and Burrows. Various legislative and executive docu ments were read by title and referred to committees. Mr. Sayers offered a joint resolution providing for the appointment and pay ment of a sufficient number of deputy collectors of internal revenue to carry into effect the Chinese exclusion act. Mr. Sayers had read a letter from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, stiting that no appropriation had been made for the purpose, and that ad ditional deputies were necessary to ad equately enforce the law. The amount necessary for this purpose was placed at $50,000. The resolution went over un der obj action. Mr. Hlnes, Democrat, of Pennsylvania, offered a resolution asking that a com mittee of five members of the House be appointed to investigate the exist lag strike upon the Lehigh Valley Railroad; the alleged employment of Incompetent workingmen, and the failure to promptly transmit the United States malls. Ob jection was made to its present consider ation. The objection being withdrawn to the joint resolution offered by Mr. Sayers, providing for additional deputy collec tors of internal revenue, it was passed without a division. Mr. Richardson, of Tennessee, offered a resolution providing that hereafter no bills shall be engrossed unpaid by the House, which led to considerable discus sion and final objection. At 12:53 the House took a receBS for 15 minutes, but no attempt was made to resume business until the committee appointed to wait npon the President made its appearance. The clock indicated 1:25, when Mr. Wil son, in behalf of the committee, reported that the President had informed them that he would communicate with the House in writing. It was 1:35 before Legislative Clerk Pruden appeared with the President's message. The House Clerk at once began read ing the document, which was at tentively listened toby an unusually large number of members. There was an entire absence of the noise and confu sion which ordinarily attends the read ing of an official paper. The assemblage in the galleries had be come wearied with the extended recess, and but little more than an average au dience of spectators listened to the mes sage. Clerk Kerr read the entire mes sage without break or interruption. His voice was clear and strong, penetrating the chamber with perfect distinctness. The undivided attention of the members was held until the end. There was no demonstration approach ing applause, and the various paragraphs were received without any indication of either approval or censure. Especial at tention was given to the sentences bear- ngupon the Hawaian situation ana a few members whispered to their neigh bors when that portion of the document was concluded. Even those portions of the message which gave a synopsis of the various reports made by the cabinet effl cers were listened to with quiet atten tion. The time occupied in reading tne message was one hour and twenty min utes. The usual order regarding refer ence and printing was entered. Mr iiingham, 01 jfennsyivania, tnen announced the death of his late col eaeues. Charles O'Neill and William Lilly, and offered the customary resolu tion of regret, and for the appointment of a committee to attend the funeral of General Lilly, who died last Friday. The resolutions were agreed to and the House adjuourned.
