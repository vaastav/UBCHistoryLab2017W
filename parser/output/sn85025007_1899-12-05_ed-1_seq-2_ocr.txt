"ttTeSDAV EVENING. DEC. 5, 1*99 BeP?KSBSTATIVB carmack, of Ten? nessee, made a speech in tbe democrat? ic caucus of the U. 8. House of Ropre ssntatives last Saturday, in which he said the result oi tbv next Presidential contest would be determined by tho conduct of the democrats in (.'jngres->. If foily should distract, or cowardice prevaii among tbc-m, then their party is foredoomed to defea'; but if wisdom and prtiJeuce and courage shall gov? ern them, a glorious vic'ory will be their just reward?or words to that ef? fect. If what he said be true, and many bali?va it is, the party to which Mr. Carmack belongs is not in a very favor? able, condition, for none of its members in Congress yesterday, not eveu Mr. Carmack himself, opposed the motion to refuse to allow Mr. Roberts to be sworn in, and that, too, tnough the Constitution having fixed the qualifica? tions of members of Congress, no addi? tional qualifications can be rightfully required, except by a change in that, the highest law of the land, made in a constitutional way. Now, whether folly or cowardice be tbe cause of their failure to stand up in defense of what, if they have read the Constitution, they must know is right, they can tell better than anybody else. There is a strong suspicion, however, that it may be at? tributed to both, as the only reason as? signed by the republicans for their mo? tion to exclude Mr. Roberts, was the precedent afforded by the case of tbe democrats who were expelled from Congress during the war between the States, for holding the belief that gov? ernment depends upon the consent of the governed, and that a State had tbe right, under tbe Constitution, to with? draw from the Union if her people were so disposed. Democratic Con? gressmen should know that they are no wiser than their constituents; also that it never hurts a man, whether he be in or out of Congress, to do what he con? scientiously believes to be right. There is a wrong as well as a right way of doing all things. Of course no man with any interest in the welfare of the people of this country wants to see its balls of Congress filled with men having many wives?though no State would send a mau of that sort to Con- j gress except Utah, and she will never send another; but having sent one now, with identically tbe same certificate that all the other members of that body have be 'should have been admitted along with the others, and afterwards, if it be proved that there is legal ground for excluding him, send him back to his S'ate, and let ber elect a man against whose admission there is no legal objection. Because men were wrongly expelled from Congress by a mere partisan majority for upholding State's rights during the war between the States, is surely no good reason for adopting unconstitutional and illegal means by which to exclude other mem? bers now. Ik the poor people of the country, who pay the expenses- of the government, held up their bands in horror a few years ago at what was then aaid to be a bil? lion dollar Congress, what they will do now, when the Secretary of the Treas? ury calls for nearly seven hundred mil? lions for one pear ? But as they elect to Congress tbe republicans who make such enormous appropriations, they should be the last ones to complain, and should continue to bear tbe un? necessary burden of taxation that is put upon them, with such patience and grace as they have at tbeir command. They may be assured that they will have to do so just so long they shall persist in electing republican congresses. Who is the more competent, efficient and reliable law maker, the man who denies the existence of God, says the Bible is a myth and scouts the divinity of Jesus Christ, and who is consequent? ly regardless of his future, or the one who prays to God, and believes in and follows the teachings of the Bible, and lives in coostant dread of the future punishment of present ill deeds ? Evi? dently the majority of the members of the U. S. House of Representatives think the former is; but that many bet? ter men do no , is plain to be seen. In New York last Sunday Dr. Palmer Cole, who has heretofore been an advocate of vaccination, reported to the coron r's office that the cause of a child's death there on that day was blood poisoning, resulting from vacci? nation. This is a free country, and peo? ple who want to have their children vaccinated should certainly be allowed to do so, and, for a better reason, those who don't, should not be compelled to subject their children to the dangers in? cident to vaccination. So many disturbances now take place on railroad cars between white and black people that tbe bill to be in? troduced in the legislature to make tbe i-ailroad companies provide separate cars for the two races, or to divide the present cars into two compartments, iot each raoe to ride in, meets with a great deal of favor from maoy white peop'e who have to do much railroad I traveling. The 

MOST pronounced utterances in the President'* message to Congress to? day, were those in support of the single gold standard and of the existing high tariff. _ FROM WASHINGTON. [Correspondence of the Alexandria Gaxstte.] In the House today Mr. Rixej intro? duced the following bills of special public interest to Alexandria: Bill to pay citizens of Virginia, especially in AlexAudrn, Fairfax and Prince Wil? liam counties, damages to property by TJ. f5. eoldiera at and near Camp Alger cum. g th? wir with .Spain; bill to tra is er 500 acres of nbaudoned land of t bo Ar:inmot> estate to the Secretary ol Agriculture for experimental and enri c.Htura. purposes; bili for Memorial brid o across tn^ Potomac; bill to pay to the Mf. Vernon Aveuue Association, as assignee of the State of Virginia, the amount advanced by that State to the general government. The memorial bridge bill appropriates $1.000,000. The President in bis message to Con? gress today speaks as follows of the pro? posed bridge across the Potomac at Ar? lington : Congress at its last neesion appropriated live thousand dollars "to i-ua'rle the chief of engineers of the army to continue tbe examination of t be subjsct and to make or secure de? signs, calculations and estimates for b memorial bringe from the most conve? nient point of the Naval Observatory -.?rounds, or adjacent thereto, across the Potomac river to toe most convenient point of the Arlington estate proper y." In accordtn c- with the provisions ol tins act tbe chief of engineers has se? lected four eminent bridge engineers to submit competitive designs lor a bridge combining tbe elements of strength and durability and buch architectual embellishment, and ornamentation as will fitly apply to the dedication, "A memorial to American patriotism." The designs are now being prepared, and as soon as completed will be sub? mitted to the Congress by the Secretary of War. The proposed bridge would be a convenience to all the people from every part of tbe country who visit the aational cemetery, an ornament to the capital of the nation, and forever stand is a monument to American patriotism. I do not doubt that Congress will give to the enterprise still further proof of its favor and approval. From tbe way members of both the Senate and tbe House, and democrats as well as republicans spoke on the subject today, after the reading of tbe message, the confident belief is enter? tained that tbe building of tbe long contemplated bridge will at last be pro? vided for at this session of Congress, and the opinion is also expressed that when it shall bo ?uisbed, it won't be long before the construction of that othur old proposed improvement, the Mount Vernon avenue, will be under way. In the House today Mr. Young intro ?iuced a bill for a public building at Portsmouth to cost ?>150,000. Since the arrival of the U. S. Senators here it has been ascertained that twen? ty-six of them, none, however, from Lhe south, own no less than one hun? dred million dollars. No wonder tbe S=nate is called a rich man's club. It is generally believed here that now that Senator Hay ward, of Nebraska, republican, is dead, the Governor of ? hat State will appoint ex-Senator Al? len 10 Sil the vacancy. So much complaint has been made of the abnormal use of tbe pardoning power by the President, that today Mr. Smith, of Michigan, introduced a bill in 'be House for tbe creation of a Nation? al Pardon Board of four. All tbe Virginia members of tbe House nave requested the Speaker to put Mr. Jones, of their State, on the appropriations . committee, and Mr. E;>es on the committee of rivers and narbore, Senator Martin and Representatives Epes, riwan on and Hay, of Virginia, were not in their seals at the Capitol to lay, having gone to Richmond, where the legislature of tbeir State meets to morrow. Mr. Frank Hume, tbe mem? ber of that legislature from Alexandria, tod some of the other members of that body, left here yesterday aud this morn? ing for the same city. Mr. Hume will 09 back on Saturday, for a day or two. Mr. Roberts, to an acquaintance at the Capitol today, said : ' I am not eur prised at anything," when asked whether Taylor's charge of ineligibilily J bad not takeu bitu unawares. "I nave my certificate of naturalization. I shall meet that and every other charge they bring agaiust nie." His seat is on the democratic side immediately to the right of tbe Speaker's desk, but all tbe siranuers in the galleries viewed birn today with a critic's eye. Indeed he attraction more attention than the more prominent members of the House. There is a strong sentiment among be democratic members in lavor of extending tbe condemn ailoo from Roberts, the dem icratic Congressman, to polygamous republican otlice holders in Utab. Mr. L-*ulz, of Ouio, prepared a resolution jrovidicg that there should be an in? vestigation of two postmasters ap? pointed by President McKinley. It a as declared that they were notori? ous polygamists at the time of their ?ippoiutment two years ago and that uey are now ucder indictment for po? ll gamy. The Comptroller of the Currency this morning issued a call fur toe condi? tion of the national banks at tbe close of business Saturday, December 2. Tbe rush of bills in the House of Representatives yesterday was the greatest in tbe memory of House officials, the total being 861 bills, public and private, and thirty resolutions. The holiday shopping h6re has begun in earnest and tbe stores are daily crowded with purchasers. The Wash? ington merchants fully appreciate the vilue of advertising, and many people here now buy tbe daily papers solely to read the advertisements, that they may make their selections. Admiral Dewey has rented a pew in the fashiouablo St. John's Episcopal Church, of which Bov. Mackay Smith is pastor. Ho has also been cbo.en a trustee of the Episcopal Tomplo on the Teuallyton road. Mr. Tawuey, of Minnesota, today introduc? ed in tho House a resolution for the creation of a committee to have jurisdiction over af? fairs concerning insular territory acquired or occupied under treaty with Spain. Decem bor 10,1S.9S. Those who think tbat Senator Daniel's support of Bryan and the Chicago platform, tbe latter of which ho helped to formulate, has grown lukewarm, never were more mis? taken in their lives. He, as every other in? telligent democrat, knows that both of them will bo reendorsed, and he always goes with his party. The sheriff of Loudcun county was here today and put the police on the lookout for tho negro who murdered Mr. Seaton, the town sergeant of Middleburg, Virginia.

The New York Health Board will not allow the coffee from the steamer Taylor to be brought to the city. The Taylor came from Santos, Brazil, and on her voyage seme ol ber crew died of bubonic plague. Other coffee laden vessels are detained at tbe New York quarantine. Tbe Secretary of the Treasury yos terday tratmitted to the House of Rep resentatives estimates of appropria? tions required for the service of the fis cal year ending June 30, 1901. The aggregate of the appropriations esti? mated for is 1631,081,994, an increase over the estimates of the present fiscal year of $38,033,616, and an increase over the appropriations for the present ?ecal year of $34,235,024. A serious shooting affray, that seems likely to result in fratricide, occurred laet night in tbe northwestern section of Baltimore. Raymond Briggs, twenty - oue years of age, shot his brother, Richard Evans Briggs, thirty-two years of age, at their residence in that city. Tbree balls entered tbe abdomen, and tbe inj ured man is reported as being in a critical condition. Raymond Briggs wa3 arrested. The brother who did the shooting bad been drinking, and the trouble orginated in a family quarrel. 

BILLS IN CONGRESS. A deluge of bills and resolutions were presented in tbe House of Representa? tives yesterday, but until formal organ? ization is perfected they were not rec? ognized or classified.

Delayed accounts of the battle of Modder river state tbat the Boer tiro was very accurate and the British were mowed down by dozens. The Boers carried off all their guns and equipments, and Gen.

The committee tbat had wailed on the President?dunon, Payne and Rich tni-on?reported thai tne message from the President was ready. The next moment it was presented. The ten contest', d election cases were then as? signed to committees and tbe reading ol the Presidents, message began. The reading of tbe message being con? cluded, on motion of Mr. Payne, it was ordered printed and referred to the committee of the whole. The Tayler resolution to refer tbe Roberts Cdsa to a special committee was tmm-diately taken up and read. Representative Taylor, for the repub? licans, and Representative Richardson, for the democrats, agreed that the de uate should be limited to an hour and s-balf, Roberts' own time lo be counted in on the democratic side's time. Mr. Richardson then had read a sub? stitute resolution setting forth tbat naving a certificate of election Roberts, 5 without further expression as to his right to retain his seat, is entitled to be sworn io on the prima facie caee pre? sented. Representative Taylor quoted section 8 of the Edmunds Act, providing tbat uo polygamst shall nave the right to vote or io be appointed or elected to otfice.

He also quoted from President Ceve land's amnesty proclamation. In February, 1887, Roberts was in? die ed. He pieaued guiliy in 1SS9 and Was sent o toe peniteutiary lor fom months.
