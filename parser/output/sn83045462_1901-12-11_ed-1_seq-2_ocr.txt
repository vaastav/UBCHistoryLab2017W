Snm of the people in terested in the Investigation of the case seem to think that the persom who commit ted the crime made an effort to raise the seat of the stool to stand upon it in order to reach the fastening gm the window. In Be doing. it is suggested, the seat was raised far enough to cause it to fall. The window is an exceptionally high one and only a very tall person is able to reach the fastening when standing on the floor. Searebfag for Cle. Yesterday it was stated that the plant had been knocked Inside the window, but members of the police force who were upon the scene early yesterday morning say that such is not the case. Precinct Detective Evans, who was among the *aiy arrivals at the house. says the Bower pot was knocked outside. sfhowing-it-was probably overturned by the assailant when leaving the house and not when entering. Yester day afternoonr after a. partial investigation of the case had been made Ad the police photographer had finished his work, the double parlors of the house wele turned over to the care of Lieut. Byrnes of the second precinct. and he admitted only those who had btslness there. . A thorough search of the room was made for evidence which would tend - to fasten 'the crime upon some particular individual, but none was found.

In the bag he found a diamond brooch, dia mond stickpin and a pair of diamond ear rings worth about $1,000, and nearly $80 in cash. Snaspelos Inet4entV. - Only two nights ago the back gate on the premises at the hoahe of Mrs. Dennis was found open, which was something un usual, as was the finding of the front door open Monday night by the colored man, Richard Cole. It is the opinion of some of the victim's friends that her assailant had oeen there and opened-the gate early in the eveniig. intending to call later and commit murder. The finding of the back gate open, it is beli-ved, indicates that the criminal In tended or expected to effect azentrance from the rear, and only postponeffthe- visit because of being alarmed. In looking about for a motive the pol'ce have been told that Mrs. Dennis. who is fairly well to do, had made a will and her manner of dis posing of her property had caused disap pointment in some quarters. Last night when her nephew. Mr. William H. Johns of Gettysburg. Pa.. was notified by wire of his aunt's condition some dissatisfac tion was shown. Mr. Johns Is a carpenter and builder and had charge of his aunt's business affairs in Pennsylvania, where her parents lived at the time of her birth. Recently he sold some property at Get tysburg for her. In all probability he will take charge of her affairs here, as he is the nearest male relative - here. Because of what his aunt said when he called upon her at the hospital this morning he is under the impression that a female inflicted the in juries. Her Sister Calls. At the K street housp today there was the same crowd of curious people gathered on the sidewalk as there was yesterday and last night. Lieut. Byrues had a policeman stationed at the door and only occupants of the house and those'who had business there were admitted. The ladies in the em ploy of Mrs. Dennis were on'hand this morn inK as usual and the police permitted them t carry on the business of dressmakirg without interruptiOfr.- Thework room is on the second floor front. Precinct Detective Evans interviewed the young ladies, but, it is stated, he succeeded In ascertaining noth ing material to the case. This morning, shortly after Mr.Johns' -isit to the hospital, Mrs. Kate Dunn, a sistei- of the patient, vtho lives at 112 B street northwest, called and was anxious to see her sister. The doctors told her of her slster's condi tion, but informed her that no one would be permitted to disturb the patient. Abso lute rest, she was told, is necessary, and she went away without being admitted to the slok room. Mrs, Dunn, in conversation with a Star reporter, sale that she has a number of relatives in pennsylvania and Maryland. Her brothers. 'he stated, live out west, but just where -she could not tell, as she had not seen some of them for forty years. One sister lives near Hagerstown. new ExpewIenpes. Mrs. Dennis, it appears, has had one or more exciting experience with intruders, but not since she moved to the K street house. On one occasion, -it is stated, a man came to her rooms late at night and when she heard him at the door she went to see what he wanted. carriyng her pistol in her hand. When the man saw the wea pon otuinted toward him his plea was that he wanted bread. After being convinced that the woman meant business with her weapon he departed. Another time, it is said. she found a man attempting to enter a second-story window of her home by means of a ladder, and he too was fright ened off with a weapon. For many years Mrs. Dennis had kept her revolver be neath her pillow and she abandoned the practice only a short time ago, because the weapon had frightened the chamber maid. ExassIning a Hatehet.

It is thought that she will tell what she knows when she is fully conscious and is strong enough to stand the strain. Several persons called during the day and wanted to see the patient, but were ref used admittance to her room. A small, old-fashioned hatchet, one which has probably been in the family for many years. was found today by DetectIves Wee don and Browne. They found it in a closet In the room of the elder Mrs. Dennis, the mother-in-law of the wounded woman, which is on the second floor in the rear part of the .building. Thete were indica tions of rust and other stains on the iron as well as on the -wooden handle. The detectives turned the hatchet over to Capt. Boardman, who sabnitted'It to Prof. Hird, the chemist in the health department. No Bleed Stains Fomnd. The professor made a close examination for blood stains, but failed to find any. He did find paint stains on the handle and rust on the blade, A Mr. Flemming. said to be a former Ken tuckian, is expected here from Chicago late this afternoon, and the police hope to obitain from him some information con cerning Mrs. Dennis and her friends. Mr. Flemming, it is stated, had been in the habit of stopping at the K street house while in the city, as had his son. Yester day morning, shortly after the woman was discovered to have been assaulted, a tele gram was sent to Mr. Flemming, and he wired in response that he would leave Chi cago late in the afternoon and would ar rive here today. At 3 o'clock this afternoon the hospital physicians said there had been no change in the condition of the Patient since morn ing. PIIILIrPPENE TARItFF DILL.

The report of the directors was presented by Gifford Pinchot, 'ehief of the United States bureau of forWAtry. The report of Otto J. J.

DEBATE ON GERMAN TARIFF. Count Von Kanits Strongly Proposes Retaliatory Duties. BERLIN, December 1.-Continuing the tariff debate in the reichstag today, Count Von Kanitz, the agrarian leader, declared that "the shaping of Germany's comner cial relations with America will be the most Important task before the country for the next decade." He furtfier declared that the United States, Great Britain and France were by no means convinced of the expe diency of concluding commercial treaties of long duration. Germany must not repeat the mistake of not denouncing in time the existing commercial and most-favored-na tion treaties. It would be quite wrong, Count Von Kanitz declared, to abolish or reduce the duties on iron, and he intended to propose the establishment of ad valorem duties against countries imposing ad va lorem duties. REFUSES TO TAKE SIDES. State Department Will Not Discuss Projects for Arbitration. The Department of State-has been obliged to decline to be drawn into the discussion of the various projects for general arbi tration now pending before the congress of American republics in Mexico. The issue presented in substance is compulsory arbitration vs.. voluntary arbitration, and Chile is bitterly opposed to the former, which Is believed to have the support of a majority of the delegates. As this sub ject threatens to disrupt the congress and the delegates seem unable to reach an agreement among themselves. several ap peals have been directed to the government here to cast the Influence of the United States In a manner to determine the issue. This, however, the Department of State has declined to do. taking the ground that, hav ing fully and properly instructed its dele gates to the congress, It cannot interfere with them in their actions upon a subject betore the congress. REPORT OF' THE SCHLEY COURT. Secretary Long Had Not Received It This Afternoon. Secretary Long said this afternoon that he had not yet received the ,report of the Schley court of inquiry, and really had no positive information as to when the report will be submitted to him. -From what he had read in the newspapers, however, and because of the present excitement in the matter, he said he concluded that the re port was nearly finished and might be sub mitted by the end of the present week. In the absence of positive information on the subject, he said, he was unable to an nounce at this time the precise course that would be taken in giving the results of the deliberation of the court to the public through the press. He had studiously re frained from Interfering with the court in any way, and did not expect to know any thing on the subject of its findings until the report was delvered to him in official form. About the only thing he had decided in the matter, he said, was that the report should he given-tb the Dress in full with as little delay as nam51Mb and without comb ment or suggestion on his part, so that the public would be. as well informed en the subject as he was-himself, and -as soon after as was possibie." All sorts of speculation have been in dulged In with regard to the poSsible find .ings of the court, but owi. to the ox treme precautions taken by te court to guard against a premature knowledge or publication of its findings it is difficult to establish any reasonable basis for recently published stateshents .purporting to give them In part or in whole. It is understood that Rtear Admiral IRam say, the junior memaber of the court, has been deputed to put the courts findings in writing, and that -when he has completed that work the three members of the court, with Admiral Dewey at their head, wi wait upon the ertayof the Navy and place the report in his has

The work would be done, perhaps, in the laboratories of our universities or wherever it could be best carried on. "Instruments requisite for the work might be purchased, and, as I have already said, those whose efforts failed to reach their highest results for tike lack of the means might be benefnted.by a sort of great system of scholarships. Then the results of the work would haVe to be made known and money could be well spent in this work of publication. "Mr. Carnegie accepts the idea that the museums and scientific bureaus of Wash ington will heartily co-operate with the new foundation, in accordance with a law already passed by Congress, in opening the facilities which they possess to the quali fled investigator and student. His plans are so broad and so wise that when they are made known it will be acknowledged at home and abroad that in this latest act of munificence he has surpassed himself." President Ira Remse. of Johns Hopkins University said: "The announcement of Mr. Carnegie's generous gift was by no means unknown to me, but I must confess. I do not understand the reference made to the future selection of a site at Washington and to the magnificent buildings which are to be erected. I was under the inpres slon that no university buildings were to be erected, but that the fund was to be used for promoting higher education at various educational centers."

On motion of Mr. Alli son the resolution was referred to the com mittee on appropriations. The Senate then, at 12:22 p.m., on mo tion of Mr. Lodge. went into executive ses sion to further consider the Hay-Paunce fote treaty. The new treaty was immediately taken up. Senator Culberson spoke briefly in. criticism of it, and was followed by Sena tor Bacon, who made a somewhat extended argument against it. Senator Bacow.criti cised the treaty as un-American, and. said that it contained many of the objectionable features of the original agreement, while It was entirely unsafeguarded, as the old treaty had been, by the Senate amend ments. He said, however, that he would not obstruct the ratification of the new treaty. Mr. Cullom followed Mr. Bacon in 'com menting on the treaty. He spoke in favor of the adoption of the treaty and gave nu merous reasons why the Senate should not fail to take early action. At 2:50 p.m. the Senate adjourned. ORDERED TO DENVER. Gen.

Remarkable Tapestvy on Exhibitien at a Local Store. A remarkable piece of tapestry, involv Ing years of delicate work and great artis tic ability, Is on exhIbition in the uphol stery department of S. Kann. Sons & Co.. on .1iwa.t -space. It Is claimed that the tapestry Is worth $100,000, and the ownets, Messra.: A. I. Peltinsky and I. Krohn of New York, are said to have recently re fused an offer of $4,00M for the work. Hanging on the third door at Kann's tMe tapestry is attracting great attention from the crowds of boliday buyers, and, is well worth a trip of miles to see. It will re main there during this week and next. having been brought here as an exhibit. The work is known as the "Quadri-Cen tennial Artistic Tapestry." It was de signed and executed wholly by hand by A. M. Peltinsky. a native of Yedwabno Poland. The ground of the tapestry Is a piece qf silk, and the embroidery is wrought out in One silk threads of various colors. The tapestry measures 27 feet in length and 13 feet 8 inches in width. It repre sents, partly In historical and partly in at legorical pictures the growth of power. industry and soleno- of the Amereaa con tinent, from the time of Its discovery by Columbus to the present day. In the cen tral pIece are embroidered portraits of all the Presidents- of the United States down to the adminIstration of Mr. Clevelana The existence of the tapestry, it is said. is due to a dream which the artist had si years ago. Being charmed with the tree dom and peace which the people of the United States enjoy, he says, he came to see In his sleep various pictures symbolis Ing peace, happinne. harmony. etc. He then vowed to present to the open eye al those scenes which he had but seen in a vision, and thus be executed this excellent work.
