President House fit's message con tains about all Hint Hawaii could well ask. anil, with tin sutlve sup port ot the executive ilepartmcntii or tin- Cm eminent, thin Terrltor). hav ing II Just cause, ought to make good lieatlwaj dining this sekslon of Con gress. In dealing with the Improvement of I'earl llarlior and tile passenger accommodations between Hawaii and the mainland, the President has tak en in hunil the Immedl.ue necessities of the. eotintr It would have been vetrj gratifying had he found space for a word fnvoinble to the immigra tion of European home-makers on terms possible for this Terrltor), but It Is hlghl) p1 ir.iable that this work will hae t.'.u support of the Uxecii tle even thouKh It has not come In for proulnent mention Tru isportatlon Is the leading prob lem for this Territory In Its relations with the mainland And the Presi dents comment Is so closely lined with the position taken by this paper that we naturally view It ns a most happy utterance. The net result of Congressional ac tion thus far hns been to leduie the number of steamships mailable for the people of this Terrltoiy Heg.ndless of the Intent, the fact Is: that our shipping polio Is wiping the American ling from the face of the waters Government assistance iF the light thing from every stand point. Our ships should he placed in u position to competo with the ships of other nations. A strong merchant murine Is a national necessity. . How over. If Congress persists In Its refusal to aid American ships If It foxes the American ship-owner to plate his niono.v In foreign ships If It demands Impossible (oudltlons of the men deslious of operating pas senger steamers then the legislators of the nation have no moral right to retard the progress of this or any other Terrltor under the ling, by pairing our citizens fiom the use ot sVeamshlps other than those living ihu American Hag It is to be hoped Hint the Presi dent's presentation of the subject will bring forth some progressive Congressional result. Pearl Harbor improvement Is so Intimately associated with the devel opment ot the world's coiniuerto In tile Pacific Hint It would seem Impos sible for Congress to remain longer ludlffeient. The needed appropria tions are no longer In the class of purely military and naval Items. Though Penil Harbor, properly equipped, must he of Inestimable val lie In time of war. It Is an cvery-day neiesslty of America's and the world's commerce. As the people of the coun try are becoming better acquainted with the Pacific, there ought to be mi effective national sentiment urg ing the national leaders on in this matter. On the financial situation the Pres ident appears to have repeated what lie has Intimated before. The only Ulffeicnte Is that ho has officially ex pressed his confidence In the sound business conditions ot the country liml personally called to the people to tento hoarding their coin. There Is no Indication of hedging lu the mutter of prosecuting the crim inally ilch. Quito the reverse. He takes rare to renew the assertion that under his administration the success fully dishonest will be brought to ac count. Uven those complaining against the Hood of Indictments can hurdly raise objection to this. They nrn not likely to admit that the suc cessfully dishonest should not be prosecuted. The declaration regarding the tar iff should bo very satisfactory to the people of these Islands. Protections very essential to the development and continued prosperity ot these Islands, nnil It Is clear that the radical tariff levislou advocates have not won over the Administration to n departure from traditional Republican policies. It Is admitted that visiting base hall teams and visitors of all kinds ale good for Hawaii. Thereforo of wlint liunnflf lu flu.

DECEMBER 3. 1907 PACIFIC MAIL'S THREAT Manager Schwerln's announce ment that the Pacific Mall Company will go out of business next April unless the rountr) changes Its nttl- tud" toward the shipping Interests under the American Hag Is not espe- ilall) surprising, though It is mighty Important to Hawaii. If the Oceanic Company had not furnished an example to the contrary, the general comment on Schwerln's talk would be that It Is nil it bluff That was what they said regarding the statement of the Oceanic people. Hut time and the inaction of Con gress demonstrated the Impossibility for that line continuing Its through boats. Congress will have to take action representing some degiee of rommun cense or the American flag will dis appear absolutely from tue trans-Pa-clllc Hues of commerce. Possibly the men of the Interior States cannot undei stand that this will be a national disgrace, but their ignorance cannot change the fact. The resumption of the court busi ness In San Krnnclsco does not, ap parent!, eairj with It u suspension of the banking holldnvs. Though the Associated Press failed lo mnae men tion of the fact, the statements con tained In papers received b today's mull Indicate that on Monday the new law- passed at the special session of the Legislature went Into effect. This law allows special banking holi days, though the courts proceed as usual. New York dispatches bear the promise of an early resumption of noimal bunking conditions, although the whole countr appears to have been waiting for the President's mes sage to assist In clarifying the situa tion.

STRANGER, DON'T LISTEN TO KNOCKERS. There are people in Honolulu who, for selfish motives, will try to dls bitude )oti from GOING TO THE VOLCANO; They will tell ou that the trip Is a hard one, and fraught with danger. DON'T YOU iiiaiBVE IT. KILAUEA VOLCANO is one of the world's greatest natural attractions, and the surrounding country Is a perfect wonderland. The trip, except In bad weather, Is a delightful one, the Humnkua-Hllo coast outrivals In beauty the scenery ot the Hudson. The visitor who leaves tho Volcano out of his Itiner ary does not see Hawaii. Como In and let us tell )ou about the trip. THE HENRY WATERHOUSE TRUST COMPANY. LTD. . Cor. Fort and Merchant Sts.

Captain Kilmer, an chored off port nt 7 o'clock this morn lug. She was boarded by Or Moore or tho local Marine Hospital Servlco and her passengers weio examined and found healthy. She was, how ever, ordered to remain off port or come Into port and stay out In the stream without docking. Pending this order. Dr. Ramus cabled to I)i. Hobdy at San Francisco asking why the certificate was not Issued. "This Is something new," said Dr. Ramus this morning. "Captain Kil mer ot the Hongkong Mnru has been running here for :i long time and why, at this time, he failed to hi lug a health certificate In something un usual I will know the reason why ho did nut bring thp certificate by noon." Shortly before noon Dr. Ramus re ceived the following cable reply: Sun rrunclsco, Dec. 3. Hongkong Mnui fumigated heic and observed all precautions. IIOIIDY. Immediately on receipt ot tho ca ble Dr Ramus went out to release tho boat from quarantine, and she docked nt Hlshop wharf. There aro many steerage passen gers from the mainland returning to Japan and China. It Is said there nre a good many moro Chinese than Japanese. The Immigration oHlcinls are Inclined to think that It would be well to keep the vessel out In the stream to prevent escapes. No Honolulu Japaneso steerage passengers will be booked to suit on her today Her looms aro all taken up. She sails at C o'clock tonight.
