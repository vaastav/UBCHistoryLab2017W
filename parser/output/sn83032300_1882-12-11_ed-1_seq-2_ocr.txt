The report of the government com missioner of railroads shows that the Pacific railroads owed the United States at the end of the last fiscal rear a balance of over one hundred and three million dollars. This includes the origi nal debt and its interest ; the latter now amoiu.tiiig to nearly half the former. Non' of litis interest can be collected, under the remarkable decision of the courts, until the 'maturity of the debt, which will be at the close of the cen tury. iy that time the commissioner suggests that the great debt due the gov ernment may be precariously secured, and he suggests that some arrangement D2 made for its earlier settlement. This would manifestly bo wise, if it can be done. Tho United States made a very bad speculation, indeed, in making its loan to the first Pacific railroads ; her courts have held her most unfairly bound, and it is doubtful whether the money invested will ever be returned to her. Whatever can be got now is a clear gain. Now we can use it to re duce our debt. By the end of the cen tury we will have no debt, and a generous Congress may be called on to forgive the indebtedness of bankrupt railroads. There is no great competition ahead of the Pacific railroads that their future financial condition cannot safely be trusted. There is a sinking fund pro vided by the companies for the pay ment of their debt, but the commissioner says that it will only amount, when the debt falls due, to some seventy millions of dollars ; less tlian the debt at present. The commissioner asks that, if the sinking fund is to be contin ued, the secretary of the treasury have enlarged discretion as to the investment of it, but he advises that the indebted ness, which is now in the form of a book account, should Le changed into securi ties of fixed amount, payable at fixed periods. The matter should have the attention of Congress, and such disposi tion should be made as to put the treas ury immediately into possession of secur ities for the government loan which may be disposed of for tho redemption of tli public debt. When Rogues Fall Out. The melancholy report comes from Ilarrisburg that Senate Librarian and Supply Custodian John C. Delaney has quarrelled with the contractor for state supplies and refuses to take the articles he proposes to furnish because they are not up to the standard bid for. The con tractor in turn alleges that Delaney is "pinching" him because ho wanted a friend of his own to get the contract. In view of tho way this supply business is managed the public will be very ready to believe both stories. Fraud and pecu lation have nearly always honey-combed the furnishing of state supplies, and there never was more suspicion and scan dal attaching to it than since Quay has been Invested with the manipulation of the contracts and Delaney has received and has had charge of the supplies. No body will believe that Delaney would make objection to the contractor furnishing "wagon sponge at $3 per pound" instead of "flesh sponges atlSlo per pound ;" " towels at $2 per dozen in stead of Turkish towels at $20 per dozen; soapstone dishes instead of china ; small pieces of chamois, instead of large skins: common plain glass, instead of cut glass tumblers; ordinary cuspidores, instead of fancy decorated ; inferior brushes and dust-pans; 25 cent towel racks for those costing $3.50; poor quality of damask towels and machine-made combs, for hand-made," and otherwise making from feOO to 1,200 per cent if Delaney "s friends will profit by the steal. On the other hand everybody will be ready to believe that the contractors for these supplies regularly swindle the state by furnishing articles of inferior quality and in quantities below their contracts. But the contracts themselves are swin dles in that they call for many articles which the state should not buy at all, and many others of which there should bean ample supply on hand from the purchases of preceding years. The whole subject needs thorough ventilation and reform and the quarrel between De laney aud the contractors may help to light up the dark ways and vain tricks which have too long prevailed at Ilar risburg. People who express themselves in favor of protection in a tariff for revenue, seem to ask for very contradictory things. A tariff for revenue is one which will admit the largest quantity of the things which will pay the duty; while protection to home manufactures can only be given by excluding foreign manufactures. Tariff for revenue and for protection are too very distinct things, and it would be impossible to ad just them so as to completely accomplish both objects, although it may be possible to do it so as to measurably accomplish both. Possibly a very great deal of skill could secure such a delicacy of adjust ment in the duties as to make them at one time protective, and at another reve nue, as the market value of things would see-saw up and down ; and possibly in these alterations there would be enough got on either side to be satisfactory all around ; but it is a work of difficulty. Experience does not show that it has ever been satisfactorily performed. It is hard to strike the line that will leave sufficient protection while it secures sufficient revenue. The better plan is to put on a tariff rate that will exclude the articles whose protection is necessary, and to raise the revenue needed from other sources. According to the report of the au ditor general for the past year, the ex penses of our state government were $3,869,575, exclusive of loans redeemed and interest paid. $1,083,524.09 of this amount went to the public schools, and $683,654,35 to charitable institutions The soldiers'.'orphans' schools cost $366, 670.87, and the penitentiaries, $216,988. 75 ; the judges were paid $481,605.02, and the other most considerable item in the' budget is "$242,395.23 for the na tional guard. Although there was no session of the Legislature. $44,526.01 is set down as expenses of the Senate and $153,0S1.28 for the House ; and, in ex planation of this, it is stated that this was the " back pay " of the members after the supreme court had decided each to be entitled to $-500 extra. Bui as there are only 231 members in al1 this would account for but $123,500 whereas $197,010.38 are credited to. tho expenses of the Legislature. Was there also 50 per cent, addition made to the pay of the clerks, messengers, pasters and folders, doorkeepers and janitors, and to the " contingent " funds ? The Philadelphia Evening Telegraph insists that there has not been a ready response from what it calls the " Demo cratic machine" to the " patriotic ut terances" of Governor-elect Pattison since his election. We perhaps do not understand what the Telcgrah means by the machine, but if we are to measure the sentiment of the party by the voice of: its press, or of those who are acknowl eiged to be foremost in its leadership, or of the state or county committeemen, or of the Democratic members-elect, of Congress and the Legislature in this state, we would say that there has been a very general and hearty approval of the new governor's patriotic utterances. From every side comes the demand that the pledges made in the campaign shall be f ulfilled.and the avowal of a determin ation to support the governor in such purposes, that tho commonwealth may be redeemed from personal boss rule.

The best approximation to the pension population of tho country that can bo pro cured shows that of the 2,003,391 soldiers who enlisted during tho war, pensions have been applied for by or on account of, only 26 per cent. From tho best available in formation, it appears that there is a sur viving soldier population of a little over 1,000,000, out of which claims for pensions in tho future may bo made by those who incurred pensionable disabilities. Delaney has grown virtuous. This is tno same Delaney who in one year got $1,200 compensation as libiarianoftho Senate, and iu addition $600 for "services as librarian, recess December 31, 1881 ;" $310 for "new desks for sea. of com. offico ;" $1,315 for " repairing rooms and bookcases ;" $428 for desks, tables, &c. ;" $908.62 for " radiators for departments ;" $20S for "sale for stationary department;" $1,203 for " furnishing desks for depart ments ;" $2,114.75 for "furnishing offices of the Senate and state treasury," and $900 for "postage, labor aud expross charges. Tue Press, in noticing, with pardonable pride, the merited compliments or its con temporaries for its recent successful de tective woik, claims too much for itself in the exclusive matter of making " an extended and thorough exposure of tho systematic stealings in connection with tho state supplies at Ilarrisburg an exposure which, with vigilant attention, will pro vent their repetition in the future." Sinco 1875 this subject has received the persist ent attention of tho Istelligesceu. In 1880 "an extended aud thorough exposure" of theso " systematic stealings" appoared in this journal. It seems that on November 30, exclu sive of moneys appropriated to tho sinking fund, the treasury had on hand 81.430.- 724.16, of which $200,000 wore deposited in the politicians' bank of Pittsburgh, and $150,000 in Eemble's bank in Philadel phia. Theso enormous balanco, let out to the favored depositories of pet politi cians, may with good reason serve to direct popular attention to the proposed schemo of establishing an independent treasury system as is reported to bo in successful operation in Ohio under whioh the state takes care of its own money, and its treas ury is not a prize for impecunious offico hunters and voracious politicians. ihe reappointment by Gov. Hoyt of two notorious Philadelphia politicians to the lucrative offices of sealers of weights and measures has somewhat impaired the improved public opinion of our governor-; but it has more positively directed atten tion to the enormous abuses attaching to this office. $40,000 are said to be drawn from the mercantile community of Phil adelphia annually by this leech and, as the Times suggests, " nobody will have any more confidence in the correctness of measures or scales, because Mr. Slack or Mr. Crawford has stamped them as ac curate." Here whero Mr. "Buck" Leibly carries around the standard, and taxes everybody who has scale3, yard sticks and liquid measures, the place is said to be worth $2,500 a year a grievous tax upon the community. Let it be abol ished. The county could easily keep the standards to settle all disputes, and the commissioners' clerk could act as arbiter in all cases of complaints made against tho accuracy of weights and measures. Pofulau admiration of pretty women is nothing new under the sun. It is older than Solomon and was one of Abraham's patriarchal points. This country, as well as England, seems to have a revival of it, and the sketches which aro printed on our first page to-day have enhanced interest from the presence of Mrs. Langtry in our country at this time. Of this famous beauty's quarrel with her companion, Mrs. Labouchero, there seems to bo no doubt. The Philadelphia Times, which has been hooting at tho affair as an advertising speculation, caught Mad. Lab. iu its city yesterday, and she owned up that when Freddie Gebhart sent his horses and car riages to Boston for tho Lily it was too much for her. She had taken up tho Jersey beauty aud shielded her from tho aspersions of tho scandalmongers on as surances that tho Langtry was done with the " idle frivolities " which injured her in England, but now, "after afew months the good resolutions aro ignored and she has relapsed into the samo dangerous gayoties as before." Mr Lab. cables for his wife to come straightway home, the Lily goes her own wayward way, and Mr. Langtry, reduced to a state of genteel poverty iu England and, utterly unable to find employment, is forced to live upon tho empty and profitless title of 'Mrs Lingtry's husband.'

BUBIEO TKEASUKE C.NEaBXHED. The Location or a Chest Coatalnlng 27,0O0 la Gold Kevealed la a Ureau. Franklin, Pa., in the oil regions, is agi tated over the discovery of a chest con taining $27, 000 in gold by a resident of that place. For many years past thero has been a belief that during the occupa tion of that part of the country by the French a large amount of treasure was secreted in Franklin, near where tho old fort stood and close by the ancient house of Capt Smith, which is now occupied by Prof Solinger as a residence. Columbus Brown bad a mania in regard to this treasure, and for years the thought of becoming possessed of riches in this way has haunted him. About two years ago two Frenchmen, supposed to be relatives of tho old com mandant of the fort, arrived at Franklin with maps, and commenced a systematic search, but it proved fruitless. Brown became excited at this, and since that time has continued tho search. On Friday night, while sleeping, he had a revelation He dreamed that ho was counting and handling a chest of gold, and that he had found it buried in the earth at the foot of a tree, in an open field. He was informed in some manner, he cannot tell how, but by a man with a foreign acceut, dressed in a military uniform, with a sword and sash, that if he would measure a cer tain distanco from the centre of a rack in the run, due north, and then mensuro thirty-three feet due west from that point, he would find the treasure he had so often seen iu bis drratn. Ho arose, and with spade and pick went to the owner ot the field iu wbich the tree stood and gained permission to dig. Ho had not been at work more than two hours when ho came upon au iron chest, which he opened and tho sight that mot tho craze of himself and sou was enough to turn tho head of al most any man. Tho box was nearly two thirds filled with gold and silver coin, tarnished and covered with sand and mould, but nevertheless gold. The coins are mostly French, but a num ber of Euglish, German and Spanish coins are among the lot They bear dates 1729, 1744, 1731, and various other dates, the latest of which is 1754, which is the same year that Fort McNault was completed. On a brass ruler found in the chest the name "Joneaire" is plaiuly stamped. It is a well known fact that this was the name of tho officer in command of tho French troops. Tho Fort was evacuated in July, 1739, aud eiy hastily. The location of this field is about seventy-five rods south of the fort, and was no doubt selected for the burial of the treasure with a view to mislead the Indians aud recovering it at a subsequent date. Mr. Brown took the chest to his home and many of the coins have since been ou exhibition in the banks. m i AFlKIC 1KM

The time was when our manufacturers were feeblo aud demanded the fullest measure of protection to enable them to develop our home products and diversify our industrial interests ; but we are now fully abreast- with the Old World in everything that facilitates the develop ment of our varied sources of wealth, ex cept in the cheapness of labor, aud it is to requite, dignify and prosper labor that our tariff laws have been most needed. Iu all tho multiplied iuventions of the age. aud in all the wonderful perfection of machin ery, tho United States surpasses the other civilizations of tho world, and wo arc now largely cxporteis and sellers of cur handi work in countries against whose better machinery aud cheaper labor wo once needed protection. From a purely protective policy, advocated half a century ago by Clay, wo now need a judicious revenue policy to meet our large debt and vast necessary expenditures, wisely discriminating iu favor of our in dustries. If we had no national debt, and no hundred millions a year for pensions, the basis of our tariff policy would necessarily be more distinctively that of protection ; but the present; generation with its debt and extraordinary demands cieatcd by civil war, will need a revenue tariff with fair discriminations in favor of protection. We have progressed until protection is now the incident, and not the chief pur pose of our tevenuo laws, and wo must ad vanco our tariff policy with tho inexorable advancement of our industries aud trade.

We see from our exchanges that thcr are some idiotic persons iu Peunsylvau a who are amusing themselves by starting in that state what arc called "'Blaine clubs." If the idea is, as it appears to bo, to make Mr. Blaine a candidate for the next presi dency, it is a new phase of insanity, and the best thing tho friends and relatives of the Blaine club members can do is to have them committed to some lunatic asylum before they do something more foolish or dangerous to themselves. Mr. Blaine him self sees that ho has no chance whatever of besug even a candidate. Ho announced some time ago that he was out of poli tics. He has closed up his now Louse iu Washington ; in fact wo believe it is for sale. It was intended at one time that this establishment should be tho social aud political headquarters for all tho Blaine following ; but this was iu the halcyon days when Mr. Blaine was tlie premier of the Garfield administration, aud when he was meditating a guano war with Chili aud a grand "row" with all tho rest of the world. Tho sober common sense of tho country has squelched all these scusitioual and ridiculous enterprises and made Mr. Blaino a political bankrupt. If there is a fool killer around anywhere he ought to go to Pennsylvania. m m A Woman Murdered for Money. Margaret Glancy was found at her home in Wilkesbarre, yesterday, dead, with a terrible gash in her forehead. She had considerable money in tho house. Foul play is suspected. The School UirH Fair.

Sunday morning opoued with very slippery pavements, the rain of Saturday night having frozen as it fell, coating tho streets with an icy surface very dangerous to pedestrians, hundreds of whom slipped and slid and sat down heavily during the day. The bad walking interfered greatly with tho church-going people and tho preachers addressed much smaller conju gations than usual. To day many of tho sidewalks are in a wretched condition and ought to bo sprinkled with ashes or saw dust. A Package Found. On Saturday evening Charles F.
