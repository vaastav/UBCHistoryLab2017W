It ls well known that thc Mormons havo always bitterly opposed any interference with their peculiar in Btttottea on the part of the National Government, , ?nd they have frequently asserted that they would , not accept any Federal laws tending to thc aboli? eron of polygamy.

By reference to the loiter of our Columbia correspondent, It will be seen that n bill is 'o bc introduced into tho General Assembly, for the funding of thc State bonds and stock?, issued at the beginning of t!ie war. Those are. expected to bo scaled at the rate of three for one. and the holders of the registered bonds will be required io sw \ir that the; were not received for ue.coa.ut of any servi? ces Tcndercd '?the rebellion. " Tlie new bills of the Bank of the State, as already noticed, are proposed to bc fucded in the same manner os the old bills. A Coat of Many Colors. The President's message is a piece of patch? work. It betrays the inspiration.? of vari? ous minds. Parts of it are Radical, parts Conservative Republican, parts (those which do not call for action) Democratic. Yet all arc ingeniously joined and stitched into a certain semblance of unity. It is only by putting thc remoto portions of thc fabric into juxtaposition that Hie difference of lex ture and quality is made to appear. Thus, for example, in dwelling on our do? mestic affairs, the President mentions as one of the conditions essential to the peace and prosperity of the country "the union of all "the States^ with equal rights, indostrttcti "ble by any constitutional means." Of this condition he says, in the next .paragraph, that "it cannot be attaiued by special legis "iation, but must be regarded as fixed by ' the constitution itself, and gradually ac? quiesced by the force of public opinion." Yet in the beginning of the message thc in? terference of Congress with tho, legislation of some of thc3e coequal States is not only justified, bnt even demanded, and Congress ia urged to deprive Georgia of ber rights, although she has complied with every condi? tion illegally imposed by that body upon her. Titus the President's deliverance about the States amounts just to this-that they have rights, but nona which Congress Ls bound to respect The President, in bis exordium, prpclaims it to be a matter of national thanksgiving that we have "a population of forty millions "of free people." Yet he, in another para? graph, charges it upon one of the States as a crime that she has admitted to seats sotes members who are disqualified by tho Four? teenth Amendment. Putting this and that together, wo learn from oar Chief Magis? trate that enfranchisement and disfranchise? ment are equally a blessing-the first a gift of Providence, the socond a benefit from Congress, a sort of counterweight to the former. Thc references to the case of the freed? men aro carious. The President inferen? tially asserts, and then virtually denies, their right to hold office. He asserts it when he says that Georgia violated the con? stitution when she unseated tho colored mombers of ber Legislature. He virtually denies it when he limits tho duty of govern ment to ita citizens to "the protection of pa? rson and properly, without reference to "original nationality, religion, color ut? poll "tics; in return demanding of'them only "obedience to thc laws and respect for the "rights of others." Eligibility lo office is dexterously thrust out of sight when a prin ciple applicable to tho whole country is enunciated, and when nothing must be said to enfranchise the victims of Congressional policy at the South,^or of race-aversion in California. In regard to the laboring freed m^o, the President coolly avers that no "complaints are heard of lack of industry "on their part, when thoy receive fair remu "neration for their labor." Yet lt is thi sume (!) pen which records thc fact, written not less distinctly npon the sarfaco of the country than upon the archives of the gov arntnent, that the work of protecting and "fostering free labor," (arnon:* other things, ) "has not met with th 6uccess in all particuc "lars that might have been desired"-a mild way of confessing that free labor has noL [lone all that was expected from ii, even with the aid of the immease and wasteful patronage of the government. And this is precisely the facL On Cuba, the President has a word for the Junta, and a word for Spain, and a word for Sickles and Fish. He ride* upon throe horses ut once, and, as our yesterday's tclo gravn from Washington indicates, is likely to ;*ot a fall. The tarir? is another matter, in regard to which Liiere is a paragraph or two of lie. p less maundering. The President undertakes L) bc everybody's friend. Ho favors labor ;!,ia with tho national debt reduction, Ls the trump card the Radicals hopo to play at the present S'tsstmi of C>n;re*s. Lia ia friendly to agriculture, eommrree and nan ufaetnres. He likes protection, because it v. ill not disturb tiny of the industrial Inter? ests of the country. But he likes free trade also, for it will furnish us other markets for Ute salo of oar surplus products. But as civilized governments can play at this self? ish game as well as wc, he recommends that we tarn our attention to oar neighbors to the south of us, sud to China and Japan. With them wo may-perhaps-mate the partition offered by the Frenchman to the Indian: "You tako de buzzard andi take "ile turkey ; or I take de turiey und you take de buzzard."

But, according to the State Comptroller, the total funded debt is only three-quarters of a million moro than it was in I SOS. Great, indeed, is Kimpton, aud Krag! ) is hi3 prophet! A cor; MTR Y contemporary thinks that the roost simple way of crushing all combina? tions o? farm-labor against capital, is em? bodied in those few words: "Hire no land "tonegr.'os; deprive them of the alternative "of farming on their own account, and they "must work for wages." This ernshing-out progress may be pretty in theory, but it would be both dangerous and hurtful in practice. Far from endeavoring to prevent thc frwdmeu from becoming tenant-farmers and land-owners, we Conld encourage t hem and help them, to work onthoirown account, and to have a personal interest in the better cultivation of the soil, Rome was not built in a day ; and the freedmen cannot be made healthy, wealthy and wiso in ono soason, or ?ve. Lut their progress will be steady and sure, if our people assist the beet of their number to riso from tho ranks of labor ; while the. abortive attempt to hammer down and crush out, wonM be . an edged fool that might not be safely ployed with.
