MORELAND STILL ON REEF BOAT ALMOST RELEASED YES TERDAY BUT SUDDEN SQUALL FORCES WRECKERS TO QUIT WORK. The steamer MorelanU is still on the reef at Kagle River, although yester day afternoon, it appeared certain that the craft would be released. Capt. James Reld and the crew of wreckers succeeded in pumping most of the wa ter from the boat, and raising it four feet from the reef but a choppy aea which sprang up suddenly forced them to leave the "craft and abandon the work at about 12 o'clock last night. Since that time the ship has dropped back to Us former position. This morning a heavy sea made work Im possible, but about noon the weather became calmer again and it is likely that work will be resumed today. During the time that work prog ressed yesterday more repairs were made on the boat and it is now be lieved that a few hours of calm weath er will be sufficient to release it. Capt. Reld has made great progress with the work since he has taken charge of the ship and those who are familiar with the situation now feel almost cer tain that the craft will be floated. ELECTED U. 8.
