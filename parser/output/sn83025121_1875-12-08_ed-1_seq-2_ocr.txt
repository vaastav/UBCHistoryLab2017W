AHvprtiser, in its cnRtomary obtnsc I tray of putting tliinfru, attriliates "the peneral I dnllness " to the fact, among otlior thingn, i that nolindy knows what are the views of 1 trnx faliinet Ministers on the important ques- tions that are sore ! come up in the approach I ing session of the legislature." Now it i strikes ns that it is a matter of very little eon ! com to them, who rereaiit3 this, that or any I other ilistriot of the kingdom, provided the i electors are s;.trt.-.i with their nhoiee. For i instance, there are in Hil i at least twenty can didates fur the place, every one of them na j tives. What matters it, whether Pa and Po, I or whether Pauln and Luka seenre seats in 1 the national assemhly? Pa and Pt are douht- less quite as able men as their opponents i'au i lo and l.uka, and will be just as ready to vote i for a five million loan, as they art now to de nounce it. And su throngh the entire list of representative districts. For the Ministers to stand up and issue an address, under the cir cumstances, would place thru, in a ridiculous position, and could only furnish an occasion for croakers, like the Advertiser, to blow their It and thns mid to the " general dullness." Thk first session of the fiftieth American Confrpess opened at Washington on Monday last. The bouse, of representatives probably orgaiiized by choosiug a Democratic Spoaker, that party having a majority of about seventy of the 28h members. Among the prominent candidates are Kerr of Indiana, Randall of Pennsylvania, and S. S. Cox and Fernando Wood of New York. The first and last named are supposed to have the best chances, as they arc well-known to lie hard money Democrats. Of course all the officers of the house will also be Democratic. On the other hand, the Senate remaits Bepttblican by a large majority; so that, unless the party leaders are discreet in framing laws to be passed, there may lie rup ture between the two branches of Congress. It is not often that such a division of power oc curs in t.ingi'cM, by which each party controls one house, and it calls for great political dis creetiioss to conduct the public business har-moniouslv.

Hawaiians are morethan usually interested in the present Congress, inasmuch as it will be called to act upon the treaty passed last winter. The bill authorizing this treaty to go into force, ought to be among the first busi ness laid liefore the house, after its organiza tion and the appointment of commitees. But as nearly or quite one half of the house con sists of newly-elected members, who arc not familiar with the object and advantages of the treaty, it must take time to enable them to understand the subject. Many of the new members, imbued only with the local opinions held in their rural districts, will go to Wash inton opposed to reciprocity, aud especially opposed to the relinquishing of the amount of revenue involved. But when they come to view the matter from the more elevated stand- jioint which they will have in the capitol of the nation, and weigh, in a national light, the benefits to be derived under it by American commerce and interests in the Pacific, the case will be changed, and they may yield to the better judgment of those who have studied the question in all its bearings. One thing is certain what benefits llawaii under the treaty will benefit America also, as it will increase the trade between the two countries, and add to the commercial prosperity of both. It is to be hoped that Congress will act in this matter at an early dav, but there is no certaintv that .the treaty will take effect if approved, for sev eral moutus to come. expedition and the death of the gallant old Commander H"cre found. He made his way through Lancaster Sound, Barrow's Straits, and other waters, until a barrier of solid ice at Roqnette Island completely blocked their pas sage further. The record of the little Pandora, of the dangers which she encountered and the manner in which ahe escaped them, reads almost like fiction. Although she was constantly among the ice floes and exposed to danger, ahe met with no mishaps, made her passage with re markable swiftness, and returned m safety to England. The object of her commander was not to reach the highest possible northern lati tude, but to make the Xorthwest Passage, and this object he would probably have accom plished had he not found his further progress effectnallv stopped by a solid wall of ice across Bel lot Strait, at the very point where McClin tock, his old comniander, was stopped at the time he discovered the Franklin relics. He took the same route as MeOIintock, crossing Melville Bay in safety after leaving Cpcma vik. Thence he entered Lancaster Sound, "visited Becchy Island, where Ross' ill-fated esscl was lost twenty-five years ago, thence sailed through Peel Sonnd, and kept on to Bellot Strait, where he found the impassable ! icy barrier winch induced una to return to England rather than winter there. Although I foiled in his attempt to make the Northwest ; Passage, he penetrated to the south along the coast of Prince of Wales' Land further than I McCIintrck had done, and even reached King William's Laud, where no vijssel ttK Frank lin's has ever lcu before. The indirect results of the expedition are even more interesting than the direct, since the Captain of the Pandora was successful in finding letters at a spot previonsly decided uHin from the other two Euglish vessels, the Alert and Discovery, which are in quest of tlie open Polar Sea. The news from them is highly encouraging. The two vessels arrived ai the Carer Islands, July 37. and then lefi for Smith's Sound. They left I'peusk July 22 and Cape York July 25. The best news from them is that the season was an open one, and that all were well, so that if nothing adverse has overtaken them they are now far on their way to the North Pole. The great Polar mys tery, therefore, may yet be solved by these daring English navigators. It is an eloquent tribute to the ambition and courage of the time that, while the explorers of one nation are steadily and persevcringly pushing their way j through the eternal snows and ice of the Arc- tic region to root out the mystery of the Pole, undismayed by the fate of those who have pre ceded them, an explorer of another nation is just as steadidly and pcrseveringly braving the dangers of the African jungles, the mala rious disease, and unknown savage tribes un der the equator, to solve the mystery of the sources of the Xile. European Corretpondence - So. 4. ptlualcy's I'x plorntioBB. IccEnaC. October, 1875. Data GaiaTn : The little Brighton donkeys are a funny aa those of ITmmpstead, and eo tame and imall that it would reea as though the trm " stub horn " could never be applied to them. I malt sat that my first distinct impression of tba far-famed Brighton it aaaoctated with one of there animals, which patsed ai on the street, saddled, but rUr!cs and unattended, trotting off to his stand tomewhere on the heaeh. They are o imall ! they are pigmy donkeyi, and I want to stop and look at erery one I tea. My feel ing concerning them ratemble thoee of the regular, typical Yankee I met on the overland route in the States. After three minute eonrerration, in which he learned considerable about me in spite of myself, he stated his "platform." "Xaow," said he, "when I see a stranger, I always want to find oat, first, who be is ; second, where be comes from ; third, where he's goi'." No doubt the donkey would reitt the annoyance of simitar investigations more summarily than I did, but he could not feel mora indignant. However, my Yankee proved himself more entertaining later in the day, and actually confessed to beiog snubbed some times by people who did not ehonee to enlighten him on his three main points (and a good many others besides.) We made a day's exeorsion to Brighton, tearing the London ttation at the early hoar of 9:50, a. w. That was hard beginning, sinee it required ns to breakfast at S:.0 instead uf 9. bat as we eould not al ter train time, we had to make the best of it, and were really eight minutes early at the station ! European travel requires one to be prompt at trains, eo much personal taperfision of baggage is necessary about the station, and at every change, to the annoyance anil danger of ltmba and skirts, not to say temper. There is no checking system for baggage ib Eng land. It is strange that so convenient, and simple an arrangement Is not introduced. Much handling and many feet are required, and that, too, by the railway porters hired by the compa ny. Perhaps the existence of the fee system accounts for the non-existence of the check system ! The pres ent way of managing baggage seems possible only in an honest country. Beally who is to know whether a traveler is claiming bit own valise or another per son's without any voucher at to the hone trot bis de mand? Thefts of this kind are rare however, even w.th all the confusion and exposure of baggage on the platforms at railway station!. But we had no baggage this morning, and a com fortable ride of about 52 miles brought us to Brighton, where we went directly to the beach, and onto the principal pier. The scene was more novel tome than museums, and very interesting. It happened to be a day for a lugger lace, and a yacht race, and I had an opportunity to see all sorts of sailing craft on the sands, snd on the sea, not a quarter of which I could name. From my first appreacu to English shores I had been ourious to know what gave the dark red brown color to the sails of so many common small craft, luggers among them. It certainly makes It pic turesque to my eye, adding variety of color to bright sea and coast scenes. Sometimos the canvas is even a deep orange color ; and if I were a tailmaker I should be tempted to try the effect of alternate stripes of the brown and the orange. In sloops Oil the beach stood Den playing coronets, or otherwise attracting the notice of parsers to the fact that the " Lady Mary," or the "Prince " some body would take anyone for a sail at one o'clock for a shilling. Small boats with awnings were pushing off with gay parties, the donlteys were waiting for ri ders, the oyster dealers stood to ery their wares, and the cbildreu were digging in the sand with cunning wooden spades. The sand, tl suppose It really is shingle.) was of a pale straw color, the ocean was blue, the day was perfect, and so fascinating was the clear, white-capped water, and the bright scene of shifting color, aod variety of motion and sound at its edge, that the attractions of the aquarium seemed Among the most interesting news by the last mail, a cre several letters from Stanley, published iu the New York Herald.

Thk incoming mail from San Francisco will doubtless bring the President's message in full, published in the dailies of the day on which the steamer sails. Regarding it, a Washing ton special says : "It la now certain that three topics, at least, will be largely dwelt uon by the President in bis com in:: message to Congress. These three topics will embrace the public school qncetion. Ihe finance, and tba condition of Affairs iu Cuba. Senator Mor ton, who bas been in the city for the last week or to. Is responsible iu a large degree for the Presi dent's assuming . position upon the school question in tbe coming message. He bas been persuading the President Ibat be wast assume tbe position of Gladstone iu Enghind and Bismarck in Germany and come oat ag&lnat tbe growing demand4 of Catholi cism.. There is but one thing to be said about the President's Cuban policy, and this can be said by the highest authority, lie will not talk of war or the possibility o! war in bis message, but will urge strongly tbe justice ofrecogutziug tbe rights of the belligerent Cubans. He has made up bis mind that be will carry his point in tins regard witb the aid of Congress il he can, and if not without its aid. In the absence ol Congres4 the Constitution gives tim the power to act. He fhoposes, however, to give Congress one more opportunity to take tbe respon sibility upon its shoulders. Upon financial subjects tbe President will endeavor to show by the lato elections, that tbe Republican party ia tbe only par ty that believes in a sound currency, and therefore. tbe only one with which it is safe to trust tbe affairs ot tbe country. On three points the auti-Catholic, the advocacy oflhe rights of the .oppressed in Cuba, and tbe championship of a sound curreucv the I'-. '. ' ..... e. . ..V. .

Stand ing upon the platform given above, be is certainly tbe strongest man in his party. Tbe talk ol tnird terrn was never stronger than it is now among" men whose positions make tbeir opinions worthy of at tention. Tbe annual message, which is now In pre paration under the advice and assistance from Sena tor Morton, Is being shaped upon the idea that Grant Is the man who can save tbe party. Notwithstanding the above statement, we do not believe that the Republican party will risk its unity a id harmony, by Becking to put forward Gen. Grant for a third term ser vice, which is repugnant to the good sense of the better portion of that party. His nomina tion for a third term however prosperous lias been his administration, and however popular he may be himself could only result in defeat, because the majority of Americans, when it comes to a decision of this issue, will be found opposed to it.

Gen.

The scheme of Stanley's ex plorations embraces three great objects. The first of these is a thorough exploration of the great lake, the Victoria Nyanza, originally On the pier you may see the fashions and the dress I of Brighton pleasure-seekers, hear tbe band, watch the bathers, attend someshowof wonderful trained mice or fleas, (aa insect far too common hero-abouts would they all bad trainers.) get a lunch, buy all sorts of trifles, or bring your day's work and your own lunch basket, and bask in the sua on comfortable teats till night. To get into the tun is my great desire, and it creeps unconsciously into my enumeration of Brighton privi leges. It seems so cool everywhere, and everyone is thickly dressed. One sees no muslins nor linen suits, discovered by Spckc and Grant, and supposed ' and shivers at tight of a grenadine, though silk lined by them to lie the main fountain head of the ud carries about a sbawl aud overcoat on every Xile. Stanley describes his voyage upon the '"P their wealth to last 803 or 1090 years. That Is feme people do, aad between the soma and tba others there is a great gulf filed, which no eaiile washes to have crossed by increase of prosperity among the huts. It it bard, grinding work among the huts, aad the signs of centuries of hardship and exposure have grown in to the very faces and figures of the dart. To be sure they lira aol are chat hell after a fasbiaa. I do not know hew warm and well fad the; are ia winter. Ia tba country they are more likely to be protected from se vere suffering than ia the cities. But ia these great cities, even during the mild season, the siga of pov erty are very distressing. Young girlt trying to make their living on tbe streets with a hand organ, or by selling a few faded flowers, or dusty, wilted fruit ; lit tle boys hawking shoe strings or matches : offering to guide you lo a spot almost ia your very tight, turn ing somersaults before you na the sidewalk, and hop ping up to hold out a dirty baud, these aretbesights that one gets hardened to ia these prosperous ecua trier, or rides " first class by special train," and lives secluded ia the matle to arotd altogether. . We hare started for Lucerne by about tueh a tour as we took to reach London from Liverpool. We stop at several towns and visit cathedrals and perhaps other points of interest, depending on our time aad tbe weather. 1 aa amused aod ioterested to see the old dream like ttoriet of travel sad picture bookt come true in my journey, the unearpeted floort scoured white and sanded, the feather bed to sleep under, the fuuny wooden shoes on tbe streets, that would do to sail in across the Atlantic, the dyked rir ere and reclaimed lands. But for much of this latter we are rather far south. We did not remain long at Antwerp, only a little glimpse of Ihe wonderful cathedral tbe mass of which we bad watched from afar on the boat ; aad thea we took traia for Mechlin. There is the place to see the splendid laces of that name, and to tit on any of the pretty bridges over tbe Dyle. and watch the gray green water, the common people with Ihe ourious wooden tavkot always claek clacking on the rooghly pared streets, and slipping off behind, the dogs dragging cut., and the scores of odd things one docs not see at home. In the cathedral is a fine picture of the Cruotfixion. br Van Dvck, and tbe handsome square, not far dis tant, contaess a tlatue of Margaret of Austria. Kverywaere in these towns, as iu the country towns of Knglaud, we eome upon the market squares, full of tempting fruits aod vegetables, aud we often make an addition to our lunch from tbe golden or purple stores of pears, plums and grapes. We were in tight, during the day, of tbe field ol Waterloo, which possesses mure attractions to the English than other nations, I fancy. One Englishman on the Cbaanel boat teemed rather surprised that we should come so near that famous batt.e ground, and not pay it a visit. But our route was to land as that night in Liege, when we arrived from Mechlin alter dark, and our immediate concern was not a search for old buildings and pretty views, but for a modern hotel, and a eom fortable supper. Here I found my first feather corerlet, for which there was no need till a colder night. They are capi tal inreotious for winter, though, contrivanees which I have improvised f r myself bai'ere now in culd nlghu at places where feather beds are not used in that fashion aa aa institution. These little corerlets are light and thin, not like a real feather bed, and lie outside of tbe blankets. The morning tbowed Liege to be a pretty town with broad streete, boulerards containing fuur rows of handsome trees, gardens, river walks on the baoka of the Meuse, statues, and lorely prospects of aod from tbe hills on either tide. I am afraid I hare forgotten what I saw in doors that morning, tbe out of doors was so bright and attractive. We tu ice passed a fice statue of Charlemagne, adorned on the pedestal by reliefs of a couple of Pepins, and other ancient wor thies. We were in tbe country of Charlemagne and bis ancestors, and when we stepped off in the afternoon for a short visit to Aix-la-Chapclle, we had reached his favorite city, his reputed birth-place, and the place where be died and was buried iu 814. In tho cathe dral is his tomb, designated by a marble slab in the floor, with the inscription "Carolo Magno." Tbe tomb was opened in lOOOby Ctbo III, and the body of the great Emperor was found seated on a marble throne which is preferred in the public gallery. The antique sarcophagus of Parian marble, in which the remains of Charlemagne reposed fur 165 years after the first opening of his tomb, has also beeo placed there. All of the remains of the famous monarch now ex isting in tbe cathedral, are his skull and a leg bone. which are exhibited for a fee among other treasures. A brateu wolfs bead at tbe right uf tbe entrance to the cathedral attracted my notice. It is a memorial and the legend runs thus : " The funds having run short during the erection of the church, the devil of. fered to supply the deficicaey on condition that the first soul that entered the completed church should be sacrificed to bim. The magistrates entered the eoin pact. but defrauded tbe devil of bis due by admittiog a wolf into tbe sacred edifice for the first liring soul, immediately on itt completion." We had a ft nay complication reaching tbe city, be tween our witb to change our baggage from one tta tion to another, and our plan to tee a little of Aix, meanwhile on foot. There wat our baggage un checked, of course, to be conreyed, there were wa waiting, and there were the two chefs of station and a porter, at distracted as tho' the world were coming to an end, shonting High and f. w German and bro ken English all in one, and gesticulating as tho' they were coming to blows. Could we leare our baggage to porter or truck ? No, we must not be separated from it, no traveliog system proriding for sneb an emergency, and no plan could be hit upon but to take a cab and tbe effects, and see the city under the dri ver's guidance. u.
