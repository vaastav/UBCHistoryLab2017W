' n- As the Atlanta Journal says, beautiful illustration cf rc ligious liberty was given' to Hie mond on Thanksgiving day. Dr. illoge, the Presbyterian preacher, at the invitation of Rabbi Colsech, addressed tl:e congrt-gat'on of Beth-Ahaba synagogue. Dr. Hoge's address delighted all who heard it. Jew arid Christian eauall.v. He preached broad truths which all good men accept and' upon which the virtue and welfare of the world depend. His remarks were based mainly on the event ful history and heroic deeds of the Jewish peoijlebut in this rec ord he found lessons which ap ply to all men and to all times. Dr. Hoge said that the Jewish people had cause to .civfi thanks not onlv because of heir preservation through so many afflictions, but those who heard him should be especially 1 li n.n irfnl Wansfi thev live m a "-- wv land where they are free to wor ship God according to the die tales of their own consciences. Thp sermon is said to have made a deep impression on all who heard it, and the example set by Rabbi Calesh and Dr. Hoge in arranging such an event cannot fail to produce good re suits. If we had more such re ligion the world would be much Ljislr;ct contest after their better. There is Nothing to Fear. There is nothing in the cry that the country is in danger from communism. No nation can be in danger from communistic theories which is able to borrow at three per cent, interest fifty millions ot dollars to borrow it, too, without notice, so to speak. There is a great deal of foolish talk in this free land on the risrhts of the rich, and as to what ought to be done to prevent the wealth of the country trom being concentrated in a few hands; but this talk represents so few per sons that it might well be lg nored. "The sreat heart of the nation," said Franklin Pierce, when Daniel Webster had just died, "the great heart of the na tion beats heavily at the portals of the grave. ; So we say the great heart of the nation beats heavily when apparent wrongs arc recounted in the hearing of the people; but there is not one man in a hundred in this fair land who is a communist or has any prejudice asrainst rich men be cause thev are rich.

President Cleveland's message has been sent in to the Congress now in session and given to the public through the newspapers. It is a clear, comprehensive, exact and patriotic document, and "like the moonlight on a troubled sea, brightening the storm it cannot calm," it sheds forth the lustre of Democratic principles, though the party is defeated and its power revoked only temporarily, we firmly be lieve for th'j next Congress by the vote of the American masses. Yes, we believe that the great heart of the American people beats in the right place, and though they may sometimes err, it is an error of the head, and whenever their head is educated, in touch with their heart, in the knowledge of the right, they can be trusted to do it. Grover Cleveland has never failed to im part this knowledge, and with the courage, not alone of his own convictions but of the truth of Democratic principles. And the .people have admired him for it and trusted him and stood by him: and the defeat of the Democratic oartv in the rate elections, so overwhelming as it was, is due to the fact that the people the great voting masses of the country are with Cleveland and for Democracy, while the lillipu tian politicians that self-style themselves "the . party" were acainst him. It was against these and to defeat- these, and not against Democracy it self, that the people voted as they did in the late election. Democracy and Cleveland will come again in 18GG morebouyant than ever. Mark the prediction The German analysists say that the apple contains a larger per centage of phosphorus than any other fruit or vegetable. The phosphorus is admirably adapted " to renewing the essential ner vous matter of the brain and the spinal cord. It is perhaps, for the same reason, rudely under stood, that old Scandinavian tra ditions represent the apple as the food of the gods, who, when they felt themselves to be grow ing feeble and infirm, resorted to this fruit, renewing their powers of mind and body. The Houston Texas Home Jour nal furnishes a bit of experience that ought to be profitable to the farmers. .It says that a number n vuars ago a Houston ' fatmer bought an excellent plantation for which he promised to pay $1 5 000. He worked hard, made good crops, paid some each year but finally gave up the farm finding he couldn't pay for it. A careful examination showed that ' he had bought and used on that place guano for which he paid $20,000. No wonder ho couldn't ' pay for the plantation. Possibilities in th Sav:.imab News. Congressman Black and Mr Tom Watson may find several big stumbling blocks in their way to a settlement oi uie teuiii own fashion. There appears to be a disposition in the district to kick the wav tney are proceeding. i i j ; rue people may couciuue, n there must be another race, to bring in two fresh racers. Mr. Watson's proposition seems to lave been made in the belief that ic is still the Populist candidate foi -Congress, and Mai. Black ap ears to have consented to the proposition is the understanding that he will continue to be the Democratic candidate- after he ias resigned his commission.

Mr. Black was elected, which, if there is any virtue m election certificates, ended his candidacy. Thus the election took the matter entirely out of the hands of the candidates. It is Maior Black's privilege to re sign if he pleases. But when he resigns he will place himself alone-with Mr. WTatson, in the ranks of ordinary citizenship. Neither will be entitled to go before the people as a party can didate, unless re-nominated by a party convention or primary election. Mr. Black's resigna tion will put the two men in pre cisely the position they occupied before nominations tor the JNO vember elections were made, and their repective parties will have the privilege of saving whether or not they shall again be candi dates. It would be an impress ive lesson if their parties should tell both gentlemen to stand aside and let everybody else make the race. Dissolution Notice.

Butler's petition to make permanent an injunction restraining the State Treasun from paying election committees and manager s at the recent elec tion, on the ground that the elec tion laws are unconstitutional If this claim is upheld, it would of course make the Legislature which is to elect Senator Butler's succassor and which is composed largely of friends of Gov. Till man, illegal. The Attorney Gen eral was first heard in return to the rule to show cause. He took the position that the election law constitutional. Tne Attorney General also took ttie posi tion, and cited authorities to maintain it. that a beneficiary of the law and one who has acqui esced in the enforcement of a law, cannot bring an action alleging the unconstitutionality of a law. One must allege special injury to bring action. He cannot bring an abstract proposition for the Court to decide. He then alluded to the fact that Senator Butler was a beneficiary of the law, and that since 1882, when the law was passed, he had drawn $60,000 through the operation of the law. The hearing will be resumed to morrow. 1 NotiGe of Sale, Under and bv virtue of a judsnnent. of the Superior court of Wavne coun ty, JN.
