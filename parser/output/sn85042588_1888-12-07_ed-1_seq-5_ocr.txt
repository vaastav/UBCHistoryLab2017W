Thegeographical position of the Hawaiian group, in relation to our Pa­ cific states, creates a natural interde pendency and mutuality of interests whfch our present. treaties were in­ tended to foster, and whicb make close communication a logical and modern necessity. The wisdom of concluding a treaty of commercial reciprocity with Mexico has been heretofore stated in mymessages to congress, and the lapse of time and growth of commerce with that close neighbor and sister republic confirm the judgment so expressed. The precise re­ location of our boundary line is needful, and adequate appropriation is now MOQmmended. The long pending boundary dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was referred to my arbitration, ana by an award made On the 22d of March last the question has been finally settled to the expressed satisfaction of both parties in interest. The emperor of Brazil, in abolishing the last vestige of slavery among Chris­ tian nations, called forth the earnest congratulations of this government in expressions of the cordial sympathies of our people. The claims of nearly all other countries against Chili, growing out of the late war with Bolivia and Peru, have been disposed of either by arbitra­ tion or by a lump settlement. Similar claims of our citizens will continue to be urged upon the Chilian government, ana, it is hoped, will not be subject to further delay. Proclamation was duly made on Nov. 9, 1887, of the conventional ex­ tension of the treaty of June 8,1875, with Hawaii, under which relations of such special and beneficent intercourse have been created. The president announces an advanta­ geous treaty of amity with Peru, and the satisfactory settlement of claims of American citizens against Equador and Denmark and Hayti by arbitration, and the extension of time for the ratification of a treaty for a rehearing of claims against Venezuela. He advises re­ ciprocal commerce treaties with South and Central American countries and with San Domingo and Hayti. A meet­ ing of the maritime powers in Washing­ ton in April to devise means for the greater security of life and property at sea, is approved. A special message will be sent to congress on the subject of tonnage duties. Revision of the Naturalization lam, With the rapid increase of immigra­ tion to our shores and the facilities of modern travel, abuses of the generouB privileges afforded by our naturalization laws calls for their careful revision. The easy and unguarded manner in which certificates of American citizenship can now be obtained has induced a class, un­ fortunately large, to avail themselves of the opportunity to become absolved from allegiance to their native lands, and yet by a foreign residence to escape any just duty and contribution of service to the country of their proposed adoption. Thus, while evading the duties of citi­ zenship to the United States, they may make prompt claim for its national pro­ tection and demand its intervention in their behalf. International complica­ tions of a serious nature arise, and the correspondence of the state department discloses the great number and complex­ ity of the questions which have leen raised. Reorganization of Consular Service. The reorganization of the consular service is a matter of serious importance to our national interests. The number of existing principal consular offices is believed to be greater than is at all nec­ essary for the conduct of the public busi­ ness. It need not be our policy to main­ tain more than a moderate number of principal offices, each supported by a salary sufficient to enable the incumbent to live in comfort, so distributed as to se­ cure the convenient supervision through subordinate agencies of affairs over a considerable district.

Finances of the Nation. 521' The report of the secretary of the treasury exhibits in detail the condition of our national finances and the opera­ tions of the several branches of the gov­ ernment related to his department. The total ordinary revenues of the govern­ ment for the fiscal year ended June 80, 1888, amounted to (879,266,974.76, of which $219,091,172.68 was received from customs duties and $124,296,871.98 from internal revenue taxes. The total receipts from all sources exceeded those for the fiscal year ended June 80, 1887, by $7,862,797.10. The ordinary expenses for the fiscal year aiding June 80, 1888, were $259, 658,958. 67, leaving a surplus of $119, 612,116.09. The decrease in these ex­ penditures, as compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 1887, was $8,278, 220.80 notwithstanding the payment of more than $5,000,000 for pensions in ex­ cess of what was paid for that pur­ pose in the latter mentioned year. The revenues of the government for the year ending June 80, 1889, ascertained for the quarter ended June 80, 1888. and estimated for the remainder of the time, amount to $877,000,000, and the actual and estimated ordinary expendi­ tures for the same year are 272,000,000, leaving an estimated surplus of $104, 000.000. The estimated receipts for the year ending June 80, 1890, are $877,000,000, and the estimated ordinary expendi­ tures for the same term are $275,467, 488.34, showing a surplus of $101,282. 511.66. The foregoing statementsTof surplus do not take into account the sum necessary to be expended to meet the requirements of the sinking fund act, amounting to more than $47,000, 000 annually. The cost of collecting the customs revenues for the last fiseal year was 2.44 per cent. For the year 1885 it was 2.77 per cent. The excess of Internal revenue taxes collected during the last fiscal year over those collected for the year ended June 80, 1887, was $0,489,174.26, and the cost of collecting this revenue de­ creased from 8.4 per cent in 1887 to less than 8.2 per cent for the last year. The tax collected on oleomargarine was $728, •48.04 for uie year ending June 80, 188T, and $864,18k.88 for the following f^fhe requirements of the sinking fund act have tagamet for the year ended June 81,1888, and for the current year also by the purchase of bonds. After complying with this law, as positively required, and bonds sufficient- for that purpose had been bought at a premium it was not deemed prudent to further •wm:' expend the suplus in such purchases un­ til the authority to do so should be more explicit. A resolution, however, hav­ ing been passed by both houses of con­ gress, removing all doubt as to execu­ tive, authority, daily. Bond purchases were begun Ajpril 28,1888, and have continued until the present time. By this plan bonds of the government not yet due have been purchased up to and including the 80th day of November, 1888 amounting to $94,700,400, the pre­ mium paid thereon amounting to $17,508,618.08. The premium added to the principal of these bopds represents an investment yielding about 2 per cent interest for the time they still had to run and the saving to the government represented by the difference between the amount of inter­ est at 2 per cent upon the sum paid for principal and premium and what it wouldhave paid for interest at the rate specified in the bonds if they had run to their maturity is about $87,165,000. At first sight this would seem to be a profit­ able and sensible transation on the part of the government, but as suggested by the secretary of the treasury) the surplus thus expended for the purchase of the bonds was money drawn from the peo­ ple in excess of any actual need of the government, ana was so expended rather than allow it to remain idle in the treasury. If this surplus under the op­ eration of just and equitable laws had been left in the hands of the people, it would have been worth in their busi­ ness at least 6 per cent per annum. De­ ducting from the amount of interest upon the principal and premium of these bonds for the time they had to run at the rate of 6 per cent, the saving of 2 per cent made for the people by the pur­ chase of such bonds, the loss will appear to be $55,760,000. Notwithstanding the large sums paid out in the purchase of bonds the surplus in the treasury on the 4th day of Novem­ ber, 1888, was $52,284,610.01 after de­ ducting about $20,000,000 just drawn out for the payment of pensions. Sliver Coinage. At the close of the fiscal year ended June 80,1887, there had been coined un­ der the compulsory silver coinage act $266,988,280 in silver dollars, $55,504,819 of which were in the hands of the peo­ ple. On the 80th of June, 1888, there had been coined, $299,700,790 and of this $55,829,303 was in circulation in coin, and $200,887,376 in silver certifi­ cates, for the redemption of which silver dollars to that amount were held by the government. On the 30th day of November, 1888, $812,570,990 had been coined, $60,970,990 of the silver dollars were actually in cir­ culation, and $237,418,847 in certificates. The secretary recommends the suspen­ sion of the further coinage of silver, and in such recommendation I earnestly con­ cur. For further valuable information and timely recommendations I ask the careful attention of congress to the sec­ retary's report. Ordnance and Fortifications. The secretary of war reports that the army on the date of the last consolidated returns consisted of 2,189 officers and 24, 549 enlisted men. The actual expendi­ tures of the war department for the fiscal year ended June 80, 1888, amounted to $41,165,107.07, of which sum $9,158,516. 63 was expended for public works, in­ cluding river and harbor improvements. "The board of ordnance and fortifica­ tion," provided for under the act ap­ proved Sept. 22 last, was convened Oct. 80,1888, and plans and specifica­ tions for procuring forgings for 8,10 and 12-inch guns under provision of section 6, and also for procuring 12-inch breach loading mortars, cast iron hooped with steel, under th£ provisions of section 5, of the said act, were submitted to the secretary of war for reference to the board, by the ordnance department of the same date. These plans and specifi­ cations having been promptly approved by the board and the secretary of war, the necessary authority to publish ad­ vertisements inviting proposals in the newspapers throughout the country was granted by the secretary on Nov. 12, and on Nov. 18 the advertisements were sent out to the different newspapers desig­ nated. The bids for the steel forging are to be opened on Dec. 20,1888, and for the mortara on Dec. 15,1888. A board of ordnance officers was con­ vened at the Watervliet arsenal on Oct. 4,1888, to prepare the necessary plans and specifications for the establishment of an army gun factory at that point. The preliminary report of the board with estimates for snip building and officers' quarters, was approved by the board of ordnance and fortifications Nov. 6 and 8. The provisions of the army bill for the procurement of pneumatic dynamite guns, the neccwsary specifications are now being prepared, and advertisements for proposals will be issued early in De­ cember. The guns will probably be of 15-inch calibre, and fire a projectile that. will carry a charge, each of about 500 pounds of explosive gelatine with full calibre projectiles. Army Promotions. I earnestly request that the recom­ mendations contained in the secretary's report, all of which are, in my opinion, calculated to increase the usefulness and discipline of the army, may receive the consideration of congress. Among these the proposal that there should be pro­ vided a plan for the examination of affairs to test their fitness for promotion is of the utmost importance. Trtbute to Sheridan. The death of Gen. Sheridan in August last was a national affliction. The army then lost the grandest of its chiefs. The country lost a brave and experienced soldier, a wise and discreet councilor, and a modest and sensible man. Those who in any manner came within the range of his personal association will never fail to pay deserved and willing homage to his greatness and the glory of his career, but they will cherish witn more tender sensibility tiie loving mem­ ory of his simple, generous and con­ siderate nature. plgppig The Indian Qnestion.^W^lli^Ill^ The Apache Indians, who engaged in a bloody and murderous raid duringa part of the years 1885 and 1886, are now held as prisoners of war at Mount Ver­ non barracks, in the state of Alabama. They numbered on the 81st of October, the date of the last report, 88 men, 170 women, 70 boys and 59 girls, in all 383 persons. The commanding officer states that they are in good health and con­ tented, and that they are kept employed as fully as is possible under the circum­ stances. The children as they arrive at a suitable age, are sent to the Indian sohools at Carlisle and Hampton. The prisoners should be treated kindly and kept in restraint far from the local­ ity of their former reservation they should be subjected to efforts calculated to lead to their improvement and to soft­ ening of their savage and cruel instincts, but their return to their old home should be persistently resisted. The secretary, in his report, gives a graphic history of these Indians and recites with painful vividness their bloody deeds and the unhappy failure of the government to manage them by peaceful means. Progress Towards a Navy. The report of the secretary of the navy demonstrates very intelligent man­ agement in that important department and discloses the most satisfactory progress in the work of reconstructing the navy made during the past year. Of the ships in course of constructson five, viz: the Charleston, Baltimore, Yorktown, Vesuvius and the Petrel, have in that time been launched ana are rapidly approaching completion, and in addition to the above the Philadel­ phia, the San Francisco, the Newark, the Bennington the Concord and the Haveshoff torpedo boats are all under contract for delivery to the department during the next year. The progress already made and being made gives good ground for the expectation that these eleven vessels will be incorpo­ rated as part of the American navy within the next twelve months. The Postal Servicn. The report of the postmaster general shows a marked increase of business in every branch of the postal service. The number of postoffices on July 1, 1888, was 57,376, an increase of 6,124 in three years, and of 2,219 for the last fiscal year. The latter-mentioned increase is classified as follows: New England states Middle states igj Southern states and Indian Territory (41)... .1,406 The states and terrftaries of the Pacific coast. 190 The ten states and territories of the West and Northwest 435 District of Columbia 2 Total Free delivery offices have increased from 189 in the fiscal year ended June 80,1886, to 858 in the year ended June 80,1888. In the railway mail service there has been an increase in one year of 168 routes, and in the number of miles traveled per annum an increase of 160, 795,917.48. The estimated increase of railroad service for the year was 6,000 miles, but the amount of new railroad service actually put on was 42,764.50 miles. The volume of business in the money order division, including transactions in postal notes, reached the sum of up­ wards of $143,000,000 for the year. The Parcel Post. During the past year parcel post con­ ventions have been concluded with Bar badoes, the Bahamas, British Honduras and Mexico, and are now under nego­ tiation with all the Central and South American states. The increase for cor­ respondence with foreign countries dur­ ing the past three years is gratifying, and is especially notable with the Cen­ tral and South American states and with Mexico. As the greater part of mail matter exchanged with these countries is commercial in its character, this in­ crease is an evidence of the improved business relations with them. The practical operation of the parcel post conventions so far as negotiated,has served to fulfill the most favorable pre­ dictions as to their benefits. In January last a general postal convention was ne­ gotiated with the Dominion of Canada, which went into operation on March 1, and which practically makes one postal territory of the United States ana Can­ ada. Under it merchandise and parcels may now be transmitted through the mails at fourth class rates of postage. It is not possible here to touch even the leading heads of the great postal estab­ lishment to illustrate the enornlous and rapid growth of business or the needs for legislative readjustment of much of its Machinery that it has outgrown. For these and valuable recommendations of the postmaster general attention is ear­ nestly invited to his report A depart­ ment whose revenues nave increased from $19,772,000 in 1870 to $51,700,000 in. 1888, despite reductions of postage, which have enormously reduced rates of rev­ enue, while greatly increasing its bus­ iness, demands the careful consideration of congress as to all matters suggested by those familiar with its operations,and which are. calculated to increase its effi­ ciency and usefulness. Postoffice Buildings. A bill proposed by the postmaster general was introduced at the last ses­ sion of the congress by which a uniform standard in the amount of gross re­ ceipts would fix the right of a commu­ nity to a public building to be erected by the government for postoffice pur­ poses. It was demoiutrsted that aside from the public conivenierce and the promotion of harmony among citizens invariably disturbed by change of leas ings and of site, it was a measure of the highest economy and of sound busi­ ness judgment. It was found that the government was paying in rents at the rate of from 7 to 10 per cent per annum on what the cost of such public build­ ings would be. A very great advantage resulting from such a law would be the preven­ tion of a large number of bills con­ stantly introduced for the erection of public buildings at places and involv­ ing expenditures not justified by publio honesty. Of the total nvmber of the postmast­ ers, 54,874 are of the fourth class. These, of course, receive no allowance what­ ever for expenses in the service, and their compensation is fixed by percentages in their respective offices. This rata of compensation may have been, and probably was, at some time just, but the standard has remained unchanged through the several reductions in the rates of postage. Such reductions have necessarially cut down the compensation of these officials while it undoubtedly increased the amount of business per­ formed by them, and simple justice re­ quired attention to thiB subject to the end that fourth class postmasters may receive at least an equivalent to that which the law itself fixing the rate in­ tended for them. Another class of postal employes whose condition seems to demand lagi is that of clerks in postoffices, "and I oall especial attention to the report recom­ mendations of the postmaster general for their classification. Proper legisla­ tion of this character for the relief of carriers the free delivery serviee has been frequent. Provision is made for their promotion for substitutes for them on vacation for substitutes for holidays, and limiting their hours of labor. Sevan million dollars has been appro­ priated for thecurrent year to provide for them, though the total number of offices where they are employed is but 158 for the fiscal year, witn an increass tor the ourrent year of but 40, while the total appropriation for all dorks til It is gratifying to note, from the care­ fully prepared statistics accompanying the postmaster general's report, that, notwithstanding the great expansion of the service, the rate of expenditure has been lessened and efficiency has been im­ proved in every branch that fraud and crime have decreased that losses from the mails have been reduced, and that the number of complaints of the service made to postmasters and to the depart­ ment are far less than ever before. The Department of Justice. The transaction of the department of justice for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1888, are contained in the report of the attorney general, as well as a number of valuable recommendations, the most of which are repetitions of those previously made, and ought to receive considera­ tion. It is stated in this report that though judgments in civil suits amount­ ing to $552,021.08 were recovered in fa­ vor of the government during the year, only the sum of $132,934 was collected thereon, and that though fines, penalties and forfeitures were imposed amounting to $541,808.43, only $109,648.42 of that sum was paid on account'thereof. These facts may furnish an illustration of the sentiment which entensively prevails that a debt due the government should cause noinconvenience to the citizen. It also appears from this reports that though prior to March, 1885, tnere had been but six convictions in the terri­ tories of Utah and Idaho under the laws of 1862 and 1883 punishing polygamy and unlawful conabitation as a crime, there have been since* that date nearly 600 convictions under these laws and the statutes of 1887, and the opinion is expressed that under such a firm Eaving ending further proceedings, an appeal been taken to the supreme court of the United States. The Interior Department. In the report of the secretary of the interior, which will be laid before you, the condition of the various branches of our domestic affairs connected with that department and its operations during the past year are fully exhibited. But a brief reference to some of the subjects discussed in this able and interesting re­ port can here be made, but I commend the entire report to the attention of the congress and trust that the sensible and valuable recommendations it contains will secure careful considerations. I cannot but strenuously insist upon the importance of proper measures to issue aright disposition of our public lands, not only as a matter of justice, but in forecast of the consequeuces to future generations. The broad, rich acres of our agricultural plains have been long preserved by nature to become her un trammeled gifts to a people civilized and free, upon which should rest in well dis­ tributed ownership, the numerous homes of enlightened, equal and fra­ ternal citizen. They came to national possession with the warning example in our eyes of the entail of iniquities in landed proprietoehip which other coun­ tries have permitted and still suffer. Laws which open the doors to fraudu­ lent acquisition or administration which permits favor to rapacious seizure by a favored few of expanded areas that many should enjoy are accessory to offenses against the welfare of human­ ity not to be too severely condemned or punished. It is gratifying to know hat something has been done at last to re­ dress the injuries to our people and check the perilous tendency of the reck­ less waste of national domain that over 80,000,000 acres have been arrested from illegal usurpers, improvident grants and fraudulent entries and claims to be taken for the homesteads of honest industry— although less than the greater areas thus unjustly lost—must afford a profound gratification to right feeling citizens, as it is a recompense for the labors and struggles for the recovery. Our dear experience ought sufficiently to urge the speedy enactment of measures of legisla­ tion which will confine the future dis­ position of our remaining agricultural lands to the uses of actual husbandry and genuine homes. Nor should our vast tracts of so-called desert lands be yielded up to the mon­ opoly of corporations or grasping indi­ viduals, as appears to he much the tendency under the existing atatute. These lands require but the supply of water to become fertile and productive. It is a problem of great moment how much wisely for the public good that factor shall be furnished. I cannot but think it perilous to suffer either these lands or the sources of their irrigation to fall into the hands of monopolies which by such means may exercise lord­ ship over areas dependent on their treat­ ment. fw productiveness. State Lsnd Grants. I commend also the recommendations that appropriate measures be taken to complete (he adjustment of various grants made to the states for internal improvements, and of swamp and over fllowed land as well as to adjudicate and finally determine the validity and extent of the numerous private land nlaima, All these are elements of great injustice and peril to the settlers upon the local­ ities affected, and now that their exist­ ence is more pressing than ever to fix, as soon as possible their bounds, and ter­ minate the threat* of trouble which arise from uncertainty. Our Indian Popnlatlon. The legislation affecting the relations tute for barbarism enlightenment, and of the government with railroads 1B in civilizing education is in favorable pro ^. government need of revision. While, for the most part, the railroad companies throughout the country have cordially co-operated with the postoffice department in render­ ing excellent service, yet, under the law as it stands, while the compensation to them for carrying the mail is limited and regulated, and, although railroads are made post roads by law, there is no au­ thority reposed anywhere to compel the owner of a railroad to take and carry the United States mail. The only alterna­ tive provided by act of congress in case of refusal is for the postmaster general to send mail forward by pony express. This is but an illustration of ill-fitting legislation, reasonable and proper at the time of its enactment, but long since out­ grown and requiring readjustment. 3 and vigilant execution of these laws, and the advance of ideas opposed to the forbid ben practices, polygamy within the United States is virtually at an end. Suits instituted by the government un­ der the provisions of the act of March 3, 1887, for the termination of the corpora­ tions known as the Perpetual Emigrat­ ing Fund company and the church of Jusus Christ of Latter Day Saints have resulted in a degree favorable to the government, declaring the charters of these corporations forfeited and escheat­ ing their property. Such property amounting in values to more than $800,000 is in the hands of a receiver, The condition of our Indian popular tion continues to improve and the proofs multiply that the transforming change Is much to be desired which shall substi- cess. Our relations with these people during the year have been disturbed by no serious disorder, but rather marked by abetter realization of their true in­ terests and increasing confidence and good will. These conditions testify to the value of higher tone of consideration and humanity which has governed the later methods of dealing with them and commend its continued observance. Allotments in severalty have been made on some reservations until all those en­ titled to land thereon have had their shares assigned and the work is still con­ tinued. In directing the execution of this duty I have not aimed so much at rapid dispatch as to secure just and fair arrangements which shall best conduce to the objects of the law, bv producing satisfaction with the results or allotments made. No measure of general effect has ever been entered on from which more tunity and inducement to that inde­ pendence of spirit and life which the Indian peculiarities need, while at the same time the inalienable of title affords security against the risks his inexperi­ ence of affairs or weakness of charac­ ter may expose him to in dealing with others. Whenever begun upon any reservation it should be made complete so that all are brought to the same con­ dition, and as soon as possible com­ munity in lands should cease by open­ ing such as remain unallotted to settle­ ment. Contact with the ways of in­ dustrious and successful farmers will, perhaps, add a healthy emulation which will both instruct and stimulate, but no agency for the amelioration of this peo­ ple appears to me so promis­ ing as the extension urged by the secretary of such complete fa­ cilities of education as shall, at the ear­ liest possible day, embrace ail teachable Indian youths of both sexes, and retain them with a kindly and beneficient hold until their characters are formed, and their faculties and dispositions trained to the same pursuit of some form of use­ ful industry. The capacity of the Indian no longer needs demonstration. It is es­ tablished it remains to make the most of it, and when it shall be done the curse will be lifted. Pensions. The number of pensioners added to the list during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1888, is 60,252, and increase of pensions was granted in 45,716 cases. The n»ma» of 15,730 pensioners were dropped from the rolls during the year for various causes and, at the close of the year, the number of persons of all classes receiv­ ing pensions was 452,557. Of these there were 806 sqrvivors of the war of 1812,10,787 widows of those who served in that war, 16,060 soldiers of the Mexi­ can war, and 5,104 widows of said soldiers. One hundred and two differ­ ent rates of pensions are paid to these beneficiaries, ranging from $2 to $416.66 per month. The amount paid for pen­ sions during the fiscal year was $78, 775,861.91, being an increase over the proceeding year of $5,308,280.22. The expenses attending the mainten­ ance and operation cf the pension bureau during that perion was $3,262, 574.67, making the entire expenditures of the bureau $82,038,386.67 being 211-2 per cent of the total expenditures of government during the year. Revision of Pension Lsvs. Iam thoroughly convinced that our general pension laws should be revised and adjusted to meet as far as possible, in the light of our experience, all meri­ torious cases. The fact that 102 differ­ ent rates of pensions are paid cannot, in my opinion, be made consistent with justice to the pensioners or to the gov­ ernment, and the numerous private pension bills that are passed predicated upon the imperfection of general laws, while they increase in many cases ex­ isting in equality and injustice lend ad­ ditional force to the recommendation for a revision of the general laws on this subject. The laxity of ideas prevailing among a large number of our people re­ garding pensions is becoming every day more marked. The principles upon which they should be granted are in danger of being altogether ignored, and already pensions are often claimed be­ cause the applicants are as much en­ titled as other successful applicants, rather than upon any disability' reason­ ably attributed to military service. If the establishment of various precedents be continued if the granting of pensions be not divorced from partisan and other unworthy and irrevelant considerations, and if the honorable name of veteran unfairly becomes by these means but another term for one who constantly clamors for the aid of the government, there is danger that injury will be done to the fame and patriotism of many whom our citizens all delight to honor, and that a prejudice will be aroused un­ just to meritorious applicants for pen •fons. SiSStfe rTj-Tiu he calls attention to the request of the commissioners for legislation which will a^,n.18^®re^* proffers oppor- enable them to properly arrange the laws tunitv and inducement to that md«- The average attendance of Indian pu- §uringthe ils in schools increased by over 900 the year, and the total enrollment reached 15,212. The cost of mainten­ ance was not materially raised. The number of teachable Indian youth is now estimated at 40,005, or nearly three times the enrollment of the schools. It is be­ lieved the obstacles in the way of in­ structing all are surmountable, and that the necessary expenditure would be a measure of economy. Opening Reservations. The Sioux tribes on the great reserva­ tion of Dakota refused to assent to the act passed by the congress at its last ses­ sion for opening a portion of their lands to their settlement, notwithstanding not­ ification of the terms was'suggested which met most of their objections. Their demand is for immediate payment of the full price of $1.25 per acre for the entire body of land the occu­ pancy of which they are asked to relinquish. The manner of snbmission insured their fair understanding of the law .and their action was no doubt as thoroughly intelligent as their capacity admitted. It is at least gratifying that no reproach or over­ reaching can in any manner be made against the government, however advis­ able the favorable completion of the ne­ gotiations may have been esteemed. I concur in the suggestions of the secre­ tary regarding the Turtle mountain In­ dians, the two reservations in California and the Crees. They should, in my opinion, receive immediate attention. Pleuro-Pneumonia..1-4r*"v!.'/.'h The president refers with commenda­ tion to the intelligent efforts of the agri­ cultural department to augment the profits of American industry. The rapid extension of pleuropneumonia, among cattle the outbreaks in Illinois, Mia souri. Kentucky and Tennessee, smd in some counties in New York,New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, are mentioned, and the president refers to the beneficial results of state co-operation with the fed­ eral authorities in the extirpation of the disease, and advises the continuance MM! wide diffusion of the principle.
