Prof. Moore , chief of the weather bureau , has made a statement in which he calls attention to the recent decision of the United States court of appeals at Richmond , Va. , involving the re sponsibility of a vessel master for damages by rain to a cargo of rice discharged on an unsheltered wharf at Charleston , S. C. , when the bureau had predicted rain. Ho nnya that con trary to widely published comments the decision clearly stated that where the storm warnings are brought to the attention of vessel masters , it is their < luty to take cognizance and observe thorn , though the court said the ordinary predictions of rain , snow and moderate change of temperature are loss reliable than almost anything of which the general public Is expected to take cognizance. Prof. Moore con tends that the decision was a com mendation instead of a condemnation of storm warnings. The lureau , ho says , considers that ono out of every five forecasts of precipitation has failed of verification , while there has not boon a destructive marine storm any where In the United States in over six years that was not preceded by the danger warnings , or a severe cold wave of which farmers were not given timely warning.
