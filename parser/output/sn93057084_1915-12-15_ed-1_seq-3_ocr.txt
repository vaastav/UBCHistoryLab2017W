Britain, who have been in conference in Paris during the last tv.o days. The announcement, issued after to days conference, says the principle of maintenance of French and British troops at Saloniki, was approved by all the participants, and that military measures have been taken to assure ihe security 'of the expeditionary corps, which is retreating methodically towards its base. ANGLO-FHENCH NOT EQUAL TO POWERFUL OPPONENTS London, Dec. 11.—The latest news from the Balkans indicates that the allies are still falling back, but with out suffering the losses endured on the rirst days of the retreat, when the pursuing Bulgarians attacked sear guards repeatedly. Paris reports that in these actions the French inflicted heavy losses on the ,pursuers by their artillery fire. The British public received a shock in the form of a Saloniki dispatch stat ing that Cicygeli had been occupied by two divisions of German troops. Later reports, however, state that this important position is not yet within the ranee of the invader's guns Giev- on Greek frontier, near the vardar river, and commands the rail road north from Saloniki. The town first came into prominence during the present war as headquarters of thG typhus hospital of Dr. James F. Don nelly. of New York, who died in Nish in February. It is generally conceded the nres ent forces of the allies are inadequate, to cope with Bulgaria and the central powers, whose armies, according to statement credited to Premier Rado of Bulgaria, now numbet I,000.000 msn. 

RETIRING ALLIED ARMIES FIGHTING AT EVERY STEF Berlin, Dec. 10. (via London, Dec. II.)—The retreat of the British and French expedition in Serbia is being conducted with great difficulty. Theit main force has been unable to disen gage itself and retreat unhampered, leaving only rear guards behind to de lay their pursuers. Instead of permit ting them to do this the Bulgars and Teuton troops are maintaining the closest touch with their retiring foe. who is, therefore, forced to retire fight in* nt every etep. Thia, it is reported here, explain? the loss of six British guns south ol Strmnitsa. RUSSIANS AND AUSTRIAN8 CONCENTRATING ARMIES Berlin, (by wireless to Sayville), Dec. 11.—Advices received here today indicate tliat the Russians are hurried ly concentrating troops along the Ru manian border. The Austrian forces in Bukowina also are being reinforced heavily. A Bucharest dispatch, forwarded by way of Budapest, says that the harbor at Beni, the Russian Danube port at which troops have been concentrated for some time, has been closed to pas senger and freight traffic since Mon day. because of the forthcoming ar rival of additional transport ships.

Washington, Deo. 13.—Cii^vintii- guns, mounted on motor trucks or railway oars, probably will be added to the country's coast defense system, as a result of experiment?: now being made by army ordnance experts. It was learned today that a scheme is being worked out contemplating the estab lishment of mobile batteries to protect stretches of coast line not commanded by the permanent fortifications built or to be recommended. Part of the $S0,000,000 expenditure for coast de fenses included in the administration program may be devoted to this work. The European war has demonstrated that high power guns can be used as mobile weapons, such guns as the Ger mans use having revolutionized land warfare by the easy reduction of forts believed impregnable. It is proposed to adapt this lesson to American coast defense by 'unking permanent works with well ballasted wagon roads or railways, paralleling the coast line, so that the heavy guns could be rushed to any threatened points not protected by the present harbor defenses. The experiments in progress are be ing made to determine how big a gun can be effectively transported and transferred from its carriage to a con crete foundation. Consideration is be ing given to 12-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch, and even larger weapons. Ill 

PEACE COUNCIL Quarrel Said to Have Led to Exposure of Von Rintelen's Activities—Baron Zwe idinek Involved. New York, Dec. 13.—A quarrel which rent Labor's National Peace council in to two antagonistic factions was stated today by federal officials to have been largely responsible for the uncovering of an alleged conspiracy involving Franz Von Rintelen to instigate strikes in munition factories. According to this statement, a num ber of the members of the council joined the organization, believing it was a body formed to work impartially In the interests of peace. Later they discovered, it is said, that an inner ring of German sympathizers and agents of Von Rintelen was in control and intended to use the council as a means to further the strike propaganda. When the government started an in vestigation into the activities of Von Rintelen, several men who had been officials of the peace council and had resigned went to the federal authorities and placed at their disposal a mass o? information regarding the inner work ings of the council. L. P. Straube, secretary of the coun cil, is said to have been one of these men. He is du» from Chicago tomor row ami will be questioned by United States Attorney Marshall. He is also expected to be one of the principal witnesses for the grand jury when that body reconvenes nrxt week. Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, will be another witness. It was stated at the federal building today that the call for reconvening the grand jury is being held up pending definite information as to when Mr. Gompers can get here. Washington, Dec. 11.—The state de partment has received a photographic copy of a letter said to have been written by Baron Erich Zweidinek von Sudenhorst, August 26, 1914, to the Austrian consul general at New York, stating that nine Austrian reservists in San Francisco desired to come to New York and proceed thence to Aus tria and suggesting that it might be possible to "procure suitable passports of neutral countries at comparatively slight expense." The Austrian con sul at San Francisco, the letter said, had been instructed to send the men to New York. Baron Zweidinek is at present charge of the Austro-Hungarian embassy, the highest diplomatic representative of his country in the United States. At the time of writing the letter he was counsellor to the embassy. State department officials, while ad mitting that they had received a copy of the letter and other letters alleged to have been written by Baron Zweid inek. declined to comment on them or to state what disposition would be made of them. Baron Erich Zwiedinek, charge of the Austro-Hungarian embassy, today called upon Secretary Lansing to ex plain a letter he wrote in August, 19M in which he suggested that passports be bought for Austrian reservists. The state department has a photographic copy of the letter. The charge is understood to have in formed Secretary Lansing that at the time the letter was written he was a subordinate in the embassy. Dr. Constantin Dumba, the ambas sador who has been recalled, was then in charge, and it was said that Zwiedinek contended that he was act ing not upon his' own initiative, but under the instructions of the ambas sador. 1 

BRYAN IGNORES COURT New York, Dec. Baron 1 HE MUST SHOW CAUSE 11.—William Jen­ nings Bryan, former secretary of state, in an order signed by Supreme Court Justice Whitaker todav. was declared in default for failure to answer a sum mons to appear as a witness in the suit for alleged libel brought by Petros T. Tatanls against D. J. Vlasto and 8. J. Vlasto. The court also issued an order re quiring Mr. Bryan to show cause why he should not be adjudged In eon tempt of court. This was made re turnable December 23. Washington. D. C., Doc. 7.—President Wilson today in his annual message to congress explained American ideals with reference to the future, spoke of the need of stronger defense in order to uphold the Monroe doctrine an'i touched upon internal problems. He specifically scored the un-American actions of some citizens and the activi ties of certain aliens and requested the enactment of laws to punish of fenders. The message follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: Since I last had the privilege of addressing you on the state of the union the war of nations on the other side of the sea, which had then only begun to disclose its porten tous proportions, has extended its threat ening and sinister scope until it has swept within its flame some portion of every quarter of the globe, not except ing our own hemisphere, has altered the whole face of international affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganiza tion and reconstruction such as states men and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before. We have stood apart, studiously neu tral. It was our manifest duty to do so. Not only did we have no part or interest in the policies which seem to have brought the conflict on it was necessary, if a universal catastrophe was to be avoided, that a Mexico and Liberty. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued remains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take advantage of her in her distress and undertake to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Liberty is often a fierce and Intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set, and to which no bounds of a few men's choosing ought ever to be set. Every American who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tradition must subscribe without reser vation to the high doctrine of the Vir ginia bill of rights, which in the great days in which our government was set up was everywhere amongst us accepted as the creed of free men. That doctrine is: "That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, pro tection, and security of the people, na tion, or community that "of all the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is capable of pro ducing the greatest degree of happiness and safety, and is most effectually se cured against the danger of maladmin istration, and that, when any govern ment shall be found inadequate or con trary to these purposes, a majority of the commounity hath an indubitable, inalien able and indefeasible right to reform, al ter or abolish it. in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the pub lic weal." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico, and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from any outside quar ter in the radical but necessary process.

(fcnlt should be set to the sweep of destructive war and that some part of the great family of nations should keep the processes of peace alive, If only to prevent collective economic ruin and the breakdown throughout the world of the Industries by which Its pop ulations are fed and sustained.

Relationships. In this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only by their separate life and their habitual detachment from the politics of Europe, but also by a clear perception of international duty, the states of America have become conscious of a new and more vital community of in terest and moral partnership in affairs, more clearly conscious of the many com mon sympathies and interests and duties which bid them stand together. There was a time in the early days of our own great nation and of the repub lics fighting their way to independence in Central and South America when the government of the United States looked upon itself as in some sort the guardian of the republics to the south of her as against any encroachments or efforts at political control from the other side of the water felt it its duty to play the part even without .invitation from them and I think that W£ can claim that the task was undertaken with a true and disinterested enthusiasm for the freedom of the Americas and the unmolested self government of her independent peoples. But it was always difficult to maintain such a role without offense to the pride of the peoples whose freedom of action we sought to protect, and without pro voking serious misconceptions of our mo tives, and every thoughtful man of af fairs must welcome the altered circum stances of the new day in whose light we now stand, when there Is no claim of guardianship or thought of wards, but, instead, a full and honorable association as of partners between ourselves and our neighbors, in the interest of all America, north and south. Our concern for the independence and prosperity of the states of Central and South America is not altered. We retain unabated the spirit that has inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by Presi dent Monroe. We still mean always to make a common cause of national inde pendence and of political liberty in America. But that purpose is now better understood so far as it concerns our selves. It is known not to be a selfish purpose. It is known to have in it no thought of taking advantage of any gov ernment in this hemisphere or playing Its political fortunes for our own benefit. All the governments of America stand, so far as we are concerned, upon a foot ing of genuine equality and unquestioned independence. befriend Mexico, we will not coerce her* and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all America that ws seek no po litical suzerainty or selfish control. I No Rivalry In Americas. The moral is, that the states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but cooperat ing friends, and but that their growing sense •f community of interest, alike in mat ters political and in matters economic. Is likely to give them a mw significance as factors in international affairs and in the political history of the world. It presents them as in a very deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spir itual partners, standing together because thinking together, quick with common sympathies and common ideals. Sep arated they are subject to all the cross currents of the confused politics of a world of hostile rivalries united in spirit and purpose they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny. This is Pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire In it. It Is the em bodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and Independence and liberty and mutual service. A very notable body of men recently met in the city of Washington, at the in vitation and as the guests of this gov ernment, whose deliberations are likely to be looked back to as marking a me morable turning point in the history of America. They were representatives spokesmen of the several independent states of this hemisphere and were as sembled to discuss the financial and com mercial relations of the republics ot the two continents which nature and political fortune have so intimately linked to gether. I earnestly recommend to your perusal the reports of their proceedings, and of the actions of their committees. You will get from them. I think, a fresh conception of the ease and intelligence and advantage with which Americans of both continents may draw together in practical cooperation and of what the material foundations of this hopeful part nership of interest must consist—of how we should build them and of how neces sary it 1b that we should hasten their building. Destiny of Americas. There Is, I venture to point out, an especial significance just now attaching to this whole matter of drawing the Americas together In bonds of honorable partnership and mutual advantage be cause of the economic readjustments which the world must Inevitably witness within the next generation, when peace shall have at last resumed its healthful tasks. In the performance of these tasks I believe the Americas to be destined to play their parts together. I am inter ested to fix your attention on this pros pect now because unless you take it with in your view and permit the full sig nificance of it to command your thought I cannot find the right light in which to set forth the particular matter that lies at the very front of my whole thought, as I address you today. I mean national defense. Ideals of Democracy. No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for, whom we are appointed to speak, can fail to per ceive that their passion is for peace, their genius best displayed in the practice of the arts of peace. Great democracies are not belligerent. They do not seek or de sire war. Their thought is Of individual liberty and of the free labor that sup ports life and the, uncensored thought that quickens it. Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning, or agreeable to our principles. But just because we de mand unmolested development and the undisturbed government of our own lives upon our own principles, of right and liberty, we resent from' whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practice. We Insist upon security In prosecuting our self chosen lines of na tional development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for indi vidual liberty and free national develop ment to the incidents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wherever there is a people that tries to walk in these difficult paths of independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea, and have deemed it as important that our neighbors should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be have set America aside as a whole for the uses of independent nations and political freemen. Can't Depend on Farmers. Out of such thoughts grow all our poli cies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a people against aggression. And we are as fiercely jeal ous of coercive or dictatorial power with in™- »owil,nat'?" as °f aggression from without. We will not maintain a stand ing army except for uses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war and we shall always see to it that pur military peace establishment is no larger than is actually and continuously needed for the uses of days In which no enemies move against us. But we do be II eye in a body of free citizens ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and of the governments which they have set up to serve them. In our constitutions themselves we have commanded that "the "KM of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed," and our confi dence has been that our safety In times of danger would lie in the rising of the nation to take care of itself, as the farm ers rose at Lexington. Must Understand War. But war has never been a mere vnatter of men and guns. It is a thing of disci plined might. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting done, ana what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately available and immediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of them selves and of It. The military arm of their government, which they will not al low to direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make their independ ence secure—and not their own independ ence merely but the rights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put In jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the world, and particularly In this hemisphere, for which they are qualified by principle and by chastened ambition to play. It is with these ideals In mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense were conceived which will be laid before you, and which 1 urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutin ized and discussed. They seem to me the essential first steps, and they stem to me for the present sufficient. Proposed Army Increase. They contemplate an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 officers and 102,$6 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7,1* officers and 184,707 enlist ed men, or MIM, all told, all services, rank and file, by the addition of 5t com panies of coast artillery, 15 companies of engineers, 10 regiment* of Infantry, four regiments of Held artillery, and four aero squadrons, besides 7W officers required tor a great variety of extra service, especially the all Important duty of training th» -*tSk zen force of which I shall presently Bpeak, 79:: non-commissioned officers for service in drill, recruiting and the like, ar.d the necessary quota of enlisted men for th« quartermaster corps, the hospital corps, the ordnance department, and other simi lar auxiliary services. These are the ad ditions necessary to render the army ade quate for its present duties duties which it has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts, but also in the Phil ippines, In the Hawaiian islands, at th| Isthmus and in Porto Rico. By way of niaklng the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale, should occasion arise, the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citizens, raised in Incre ments of 133,000 a year throughout a period of three years. This it is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of training for short periods throughout, three years, and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional "furlough'V period of three years. This force of 400,000 men would be provided with personal accoutrements as fast as en listed and their equipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would be assembled for training at stated intervals at convenient places In association with suitable units of the reg ular army. Their period of annual train ing would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. It would depend upon the patriotic feel ing of the younger men of the country whether they responded to such a call to service or not. It would depend upon the patriotic spirit of the employers of the country whether they made It possible for the younger men in their employ to re spond under favorable conditions or not. I, for one, do not doubt the patriotic de votion either of our young men or of those who give them employment—those for whose benefit and protection they would in fact enlist. I would look for ward to the success of such an experiment with entire confidence. At least so much by way of prepara tion for defense seems to me to be abso lutely imperative now. We can not do less, ,, -,r (Jew Naval Plan. The program which will be laid before you by the secretary of the navy is sim ilarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out but it does make definite and explicit a pro gram which has heretofore been only im plicit, held in the minds of the commit tees on naval affairs and disclosed In the debates of the two houses, but nowhere formulated or formally adopted. It seems to me very clear that it will be to the advantage of the country for the con gress to adopt a comprehensive plan for puting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency and to press that plan to completion within the next five years. We have always looked to the navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense: we have always seen it to be our manifest course of prudence to be strong on the seas. Year ly year we have been creating a navy which now ranks very high indeed among the navies of the maritime nations. We should now definitely determine how we shall com plete what we have begun, and how soon. The program to be laid before you con templates the construction within five years of 10 battleships, six battle cruisers. 10 scout cruisers, 60 destroyers, IS fleet submarines, 8S coast submarines, four gunboats, one hospital ship, two ammunition ships, two fuel oil ships and one repair ship. It is proposed that of this number we shall the first year provide for the construction of two batleshlps, two battle cruisers, tbree scout cruisers, 15 destroyers, five fleet submarines, 25 coast submarines, two gunboats, and one hospital ship the second year, two batleshlps. one scout cruiser, 10 destroyers, four fleet subma rines, 15 coast submarines, one gunboat, and one fuel oil ship the third'year, two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet sub marines, and 15 coast submarines the fourth year, two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, 10 destroyers, two fleet submarines, 15 coast subma rines, one ammunition ship, and one fuel 011 ship, and the fifth year, two battle ships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruis ers, 10 destroyers, two fleet submarines, 35 coast submarines, one gunbfiat, one am* muntion ship, and one repair ship. More Men Needed. The secretary of the navy is asking also for the immediate addition to the per sonnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors, 2,500 apprentice seamen, and 1,500 marines. This increase would be sufficient to care for the ships which are to be completed with in the fiscal year 1917, and also for the number of men which must be put in training to man the ships which will be completed early in 1918. It is also neces-. sary that the number of midshipmen at the naval academy at Annapolis should be increased by at least 300 in order that the force of officers should be more rapidly added to and authority is asked to ap point, for engineering duties only, ap proved graduates of engineering colleges, and for service in the aviation corps a certain number of men taken from civil life. If this full program should be carried out we should have built or building in 1921. according to the estimates of sur vival and standards of classification fol lowed by the general board of the depart ment, an effective navy consisting of 27 battleships, of the first line, six battle cruisers, 25 battleships of the second line. 10 armored cruisers, 13 scout cruisers, five first class cruisers, three second class cruisers, 10 third class cruisers. 108 de stroyers, 18 fleet submarines, 157 coast submarines, six monitors, 20 gunboats, four supply ships, 15 fuel ships, four transports, three tenders to torpedo ves sels, eight vessels of special types, and two ammunition ships. This would be a navy fitted to our needs and worthy of our traditions. U. 8. Merchant Marina. But armies and instruments of war are only part of what has to be considered If we are to consider the supreme matter of national self-sufficiency and security In all its aspects. There are other great matters w'hlch will be thrust upon our at tention whether we will or not. There is. for example, a very pressing question of trade and shipping involved in this great problem of national adequacy. It is neces for many weighty reasons of national ef ficiency and development that we should have a great merchant marine. The great merchant fleet we once used to make us rich, that great body of sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag Into every sea, and who were the pride and often the bulwark of the nation, we have almost driven out of existence by Inexcusable neglect and Indifference and by a hope lessly blind and provincial policy of so called economic protection. It is high time we repaired our mistake and resumed our commercial independence on the seas. Why Ships Are Needed. for it Is a question of Independence. If other nations go to war or seek to ham per each other's commerce, our merchants, it seems, are at their mercy, to do with as they please. We must use their ships, and use them as they determine.. we have not ships enough of our own. We cannot handle our own comRMrc# «h^hs seas. Our independience is provincllL is only on land and within, our om| ders. We are not likely to be penal to Use even the ships of other "atlons Itf rivalry of their own trade, and s*e with out means to extend our commerce even where the doora are wide open and our goods desired. 8uch a situation te not tp be endured.
