FEAR AND ADMIRATION THE SENTIMENT ABROAD. Tli ftltuntlon has the germ of an Immediate control rrnj." Wentniln nter (Musette, Lunilnn. jndon, Dec. 4. President Roosevelt's message holds the ilrst place in tre- after iioi,n nuwsiiaper.s here to-day. Strong gen eral approval of the pronouncement, which. as tha St. James Gazette s-ays, "striken notes- of conscious strength and assured tuc euss." is tlie pervading tone of the editorials. "The spirited declaration for Monroeism will cause a muter in Europe," says tho Westminster Gazette, which continues: "If the Kaiser is really of the opinion, as al leged, that 'the American peril is the ques tion af the future for Europe, he will iind confirmation in the message. He will envy Secretary Gage's surplus of $1j.O"0.J0 avaii- oie tor ijut.u.ng ironclads, or otner pur- j o.-e: fcr the American doctrine backed by me American surplus means that many Kuron van ambitions in South America aru I that u js. the polKy of'thls country, if called f.kr..il.itiifHl lit till llfii t.K 1- tin jltfltfi i tijujii in in unt; ! ciniiL-. iu fiiiuu uv iii United States in defense of the doctrine. te are also an American Power, and it was we who iirst suggested the idea." After noting that South America, the only outlet for tho surplus population of Europe, Is hugely in the possession of the corrupt Spanish, over whom tho United States throws its aegis without guaranteeing good government, the Westminster Gazette con eludes: "It is not cay to atMrm this is the Inter ests of mankind, and when the United States, after winning Europe not to enter; America, proceeds itself to step out of the American continent, even a theoretical d" fens.; is difficult. The situation has the germs of an immediate controversy in the future." "Tlierr live in Amerlcn a spirit of Europe for the Americans." Xencn Wiener Tnjceblntt, Vienna. Vienna. Dec. 4. Discussing President Boosevelt's message to Congress, the Aus trian papers are unanimous in rralsing the references to anarchists, hut on other roints they nre not quits so laudatory. The FremueiiMutt comments on tho peace ful tone of tho message, remarking that President Itoosevelt evidently will not allow himself to be carried away by senseless Chauvinists. The Neues Wiener Tageblatt dwells on its "imperialistic character." adding: "There lives in America a spirit, as an "appendant" to thi- Monroe Docttlne formula, of Europe for the Americans; and this formula, al though clad in the most peaceful phrases, pervades the message." The Deutsche Voiksblatt declares that the policy enunciated must expand American production, and, therefore, "measures for the protection of Austrian production are required by the dictates of self-preservation." The Austrian Volks-Zeltung believes that the strencth of the message lies In the mod eration of Its tone, adding: "It speaks in the language of a strong man who knows he requires no sonorous words to be heard." The Neues Wiener Journal, also dealing with the power of the message, recommends It to close study so as to "tind means, at the proper time, of spoiling his game."
