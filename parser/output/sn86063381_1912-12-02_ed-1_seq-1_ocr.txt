Brandon, Man Dec. 2 A new i war has broken outnot in foreign lands, but here on the American con tinent.

MORE ARE ARRESTED Seventeen "Jim Jam Jems" Dealers In Minneapolis Held On $500 Sail. NO MORE BOOKS ON SALE NOW Minneapolis, Dec. 2. Seventeen Minneapolis newsdealers were arrest ed Saturday and arraigned before United States Commissioner Howard S. Abbott in the crusade begun by the federal government to suppress the sale of "Jim Jam Jems," a month ly issued at Bismarck, N. D., whose publishers, Samuel H. Clark, and others, were recently indicted by the federal grand jury at Fargo, N. D. They are charged with having accept ed from express companies copies of the semi-annual number of "'Jim Jam Jems," shipped from Bismarck, last July. The newsdealers waived ex amination and were bound over to the next term of the federal grand jury which will meet the first Tues day in April. Bail was fixed at $500 and the personal bond of each was accepted for the amount. Those arrested Saturday were James Adair, 626 Hennepin ave nue. Barney H. Bertleson, 6 East Third street. William H.

The arrests made in Minneapolis follow a similar crusade a week ago against St. Paul newsdealers hand ling "Jim Jam Jems." The informa tion on which the arrests were made was secured by the postoffice inspec tors under the direction of R. D. Simmons, inspector in charge, St. Paul. Inspectors John H. Chase, John Lucey, M. Hugdal and R. S. Greggs secured the information for the arrests in Minneapolis and turn ed it over to the office of the United States district attorney. The war rants were sworn to by Assistant Dis trict Attorney M. Dickey They were served in each case by United States Marshal W. H. Grimshaw in person The charge is a violation of section 16-18 of the the postal laws and regulations, which covers the sending of objectionable matter by mail and express in interstate com merce. The semi-annual number of "Jim Jam Jems" which is specifically men tioned in the warrants, is a volume into which all the monthly issues for the half year preceding are bound. The publishers, indicted by the grand jury at Fargo, N. D., early in Novem ber are out on $2,500 bail. The max imum penalty for conviction of the charge is $5,000 fine and five years imprisonment. Minneapolis newsdealers said today that they had removed "Jim Jam Jems" from their shelves as soon as they were aware that the federal au thorities had declared it objectionable literature. None of them would ven ture an opinion on the probable out come of the grand jury hearing.

BODIES ARE NOT RECOVERED LaterThe Rainy river froze over without the bodies being recovered, and it is doubtful if they will ever be found. Baudette, Dec. 2. A double drowning occurred in the Rainy riv er opposite Clementson Friday night, when Amos Annis and Michael Carey lost their lives. The young men who were working for farmers on the Canadian side, secured a small boat and started across the river to spend the evening with friends at Clement son. This was about eight o'clock and shortly afterward cries for help were heard by persons on both shores, but nothing could be seen of the young men. The boat was an old one and the general theory is that it sank in the middle of the river. Searching parties were on the scene early the next morning but no trace of either the bodies or of the boat could be found. The search for the bodies has been kept up ever since, but -so far without success. The victims of the accident were about twenty-nine years of age. One was a Scotchman and the other an Irishman, and they came from the old country only about a year ago. Annis had established a home at the Can adian side of the International bridge where his mother and one sister re side. Carey has one brother, George, who resides on the Canadian side opposite Clementson. The tragedy has caused deep gloom at Sleeman and Clementson where the young men were well known and liked. The homesteaders are bending every effort to recover th bodies without delay, as the river is expect ed to be frozen over any day now. Either Sunshine or Fire.

NATION'S RULERS AGAIN AT WORK Third Session of Sixty-Second Con gress Opened at Noon Today In Washington. HOUSES ADJOURNED PROMPTLY Action Taken Ont of Respect For De ceased Members Whose Desks Were Buried with Flowers. ARCHBALD TRIAL ON TUESDAY Senate Will Devote at Least Two Hours a Day to Hearing Evi dence In the Case. By Halted ftm. Washington, D. C, Dec. 2. 'Whack, whack, thumpety-thump." "Rat-a-tat-tat." With these gavel strokes today, re spectively, in the house and senate, exactly as the bronze clocks pointed to 12, the third session of the Sixty second congress was convened. The peoples' servants were at work again. From the crack of the respective gavels, congress settled into the traces of legislative business, to end only on March 4, when a new presi dent and a Democratic congress step in. History-old scenes were repeated today at the opening of both houses. Ancient precedents, almost law from hallowed observance, were rigorously followed. In the senate, Senator Augustus O. Bacon, large, florid and the person ification of "Senatorial dignity," did the honors. His was the hand which lightly tapped the marble-topped desk of the presiding officer. Speaker Champ Clark, with vigor ous and resounding thumps of his gavel, did similar duty at the south end of the capitol. In both chambers, death lent a somber touch to the opening cere monies. The senate mourned in its bereavement of Vice-president Sher man and former Senator Heyburn, of Idaho, both of whom died during the recess since last August. In the house, a half-dozen ma hogany desks, covered with flowers, and draped with crepe, brought a tear to the eye of many returning mem bers. Out of respect to their deceased members both houses adjourned with in a very few minutes after conven ing, after transacting minor and nec essary initial business. Senator Root of New York, in a feeling eulogy, officially announced in the senate the death of Vice-presi dent Sherman, in whose absence the president pro tempore of the senate, Senator Bacon, acted as presiding of ficer. Senator Borah, of Idaho, fol lowed the New York senator with the announcement of the death of his former colleague, Senator Hey burn. Resolutions were then passed expressing deep sorrow of the sen ate, and sympathy for the bereaved families. The senate then adjourned until Tuesday. Similar recognition of their dead wns made in the house. "The house will be in order," were Speaker Clark's salutatory remarks, with a wide smilefor the speaker. A roll call was then ordered, to ascer tain if a quorum of the house was present. Appointment of committees to no tify the senate and president Taft that the house was in session again and ready to do business, with a faint hint to the president that the house was ready to receive any mes sage or legislative suggestions from him, was then the final business be fore the house adjourned until noon Tuesday. Presentation of President Taft'a annual message is on tomorrow's pro gram in both houses. It is almost uni formly transmitted on the second day of every session. Opening of the impeachment trial of Judge Robert D. Archbald, of" the Commerce court, is also scheduled to morrow. Strife of recent battles on political campaign fields lent both a humorous and a tragic angle to today's brief session. Many war-scarred veterans of a generation of campaigns looked upon the opening gayety for the last time. They were the ones defeated last month in the Democratic land slide. Despite their political misfortunes, the "lame ducks" laughed and joked across the aisles to their victorious opponents. This aftermath of the re- (Continued on last page). ****m*mtMm*imi*m i J.
