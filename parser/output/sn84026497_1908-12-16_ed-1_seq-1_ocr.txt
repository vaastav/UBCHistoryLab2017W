This they did without re sistance and no Bhot came from the forts on land. The crew of the Alix was put ashore and the Dutch officer and marines re mained on board, the Gelderland Anal ly taking the Allx in tow and steaming away with her prize. The seizure of the Alix was In ac cordance with the plans of the Holland government, when instructions were issued to the three Dutch warships now in these waters to make a dem onstration off the coast of Venezuela, and to capture any Venezuelan Hhlps of war or guard vessels that they might find. The arrival of the Gelderland at Willemstad was greeted with unbound ed enthusiasm by those" who noticed the cruiVr's approach, and soon the entire pnpSlaoe were down to the wa ter's edge to welcome the return of the Gelderland. towing the first of the enemy's ships, as though from a great conquest.

SHIPS ARE BEST, Admiral Evans Says Latest De signs Are Superior to English. Urges the Superiority of the 13-Inch Gun Over the 12-Inch, and Asserts That the Change to the Latter Was a Serious Blunder Is of Opinion That the Lower Edge of the Armor Belt Is Too Low Rather Than Too High. New York, Dec. 15. That the latest battleships built by this company are Vastly superior to England's Dread' naught Is emphatically stated by Rear Admiral Kobley D. Evans In an article in (he latest number of Hampton's Broadway Magazine, wherein he strongly defends the American navy and replies to criticisms of it made some time ago by Henry Reuterdabl and others. "I do not for a moment claim that the Indlnna and her sister ships are equal to the Dreadnaught of the Brit ish navy," says Admiral Evans, "only that she is the equal of the English ships designed at the same time. But I do claim that our latest ships are vastly superior to the Dreadnaught." Admiral Evans urges the superior ity of the 13-inch gun over the 12-lnch and asserts that the change to the les ser calibre to conform to England's type was a most serious blunder. He also declares that "after many weeks of close observation, I am sure that the lower edge of the armor belt Is too high rather than too low." It had been strenuously contended by critics that the low location of the belt was a vital point of weakness. "As the upper edge of the belt is al ways even with or above the level of the protective belt," continues Admiral Evans, "the danger to be apprehended from a projectile penetrating above the belt, beyond the wrecking effect of such projectile, Is that due to the amount of water that may enter the hole. "It is the damage that may be done by such projectiles entering below that may cause the ship to sink by ex ploding magazines or boilers, even, but this is improbable. It will require many 12-Inch shells on the water line or In any other place to disable or lnk a ship if the officers and men know their business and want to fight." Admiral Evans continues: "Of all the inaccurate and mislead ing statements in this wonderful Reu terdahl criticism, the most incorrect is that the battleships of the United States are In exactly the same condi tion as were the Russian ships after the Russo-Japanese fight In the Sea of Japan not temporarily, but perma nently. I assert that the battle fleet of the TTnited States was never and never will be, never can be, in the con dition of that Russian fleet when it went, into action for the last time."

As the train steamed Into the depot the president was gneeted with shouts ot "Ixing live Castro" and much cheer ing. The Venezuelan charge d'affaires at Berlin, the consul and other prominent Venezuelans bad great difficulty in making their way to Castro's car. The president, although having the appear ance of a sick man, was full of energy. The Venezuelan consul read a short address of welcome and the president apparently was about to reply when another train dashed In at the opposite platform with such a deafening noise that his effort to speak was In vain. The party was driven in motor cars decorated with Venezuelan flags to the Hotel Esplanda, about 15 minutes' distance. A band struck up the Ven ezuelan hymn as President Castro, with his wife on his arm, entered the hotel corridor. The president declined to be interviewed. Members of Castro's suite stated that the president had Bent a dispatch to Emperor William from Herbesthal on the German frontier, stating that he had come to Germany for medical treatment, and expressing profound homage In his majesty. According to the same authority, when he learned the news of a cap ture of a Venezuelan vessel by the Dutch cruiser Gelderland he was not greatly affected, merely remarking that there was no such vessel in the Venezuelan service.
