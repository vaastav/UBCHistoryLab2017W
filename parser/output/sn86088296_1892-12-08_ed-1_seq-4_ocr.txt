RATIO FOR SILVER. Senator Allison has informed the international monetary conference at Brussels ttiat his constituents, raean iuir the people of the United States, would be satisfied if fcilver was coined at a fixed ratio and made a legal tender. Senator AUUon micht as well talk about making wheat or corn or cotton a legal tender "at a fixed ratio." Silver is a commodity dependent entirely in the marktt on its production and use or consumption. It has been steadily falling in price just as the production in our mines has increased, less the increased consump tion in the manufacture of sil ver ware. That helps it to some extent and as it becomes less valuable more of it is ubi-d in the manufacture of silverware. Thirty years at'O fifteen and one half grains of silver was worth in the market one grain of gold, now it re quires twenty five grains of silver to equal one grain of gold. If there had not been an increase of supply of gold from our western mines that was ex traordinary and the pioduct of silver had been the same as it has for the last thirty years, it would now have taken forty or fifty grains cf silver to equal one grain of gold. We believe it is a fact that more sil ver is mined in proportion to gold than tin years ago, and that the proportion of the production of silver over go!d is increasing every year. How theD, under these condition does Senator Allison propose to "fix aatio" that is changing every day? If all the na tions represented at the monetary con ference at Brussels were to obligate themselves to buy the same amount of silver every month that the govern meiit of the United States is doing un der th eSherman act, they might re tard the depression of silver, for such a market would have the effect of booming the white metal for a while, but it is admitted by our best flaan tiers of both parties that unless the Sherman act is repealed it will bankrupt the United States. Mr. Sherman, the author of the act, who has the reputation of being the most comprehensive nnd sagacious financier in this couu. i , says it must be repealed. It is not likely then that other na ticn-i will adopt u policy that we are about to abandon in order to aid the silver barons of the Western states in retarding the depreciation of silver, when we admit it his brought us to the vestibule of an insolvent court. There if no question in poll ics so perplexing as the monetary affairs of a government, and it is so because we have so, few men who look any deeper than the tops of things. Knowledge on this subject Is superficial and our money tinkers are tjros and vampires. We must honestly get down to the bottom facts before we begin to lay even a foundation to a stable and permanent financial structure. Gold and silver are both the best 'representatives of values and both are capable of forming the standard by which all other values are measured. And whilst we confess we have not the capacity to build this structure we can tee by common sense glasses the difficulties surrounding Senator Alli son's proposition. We are not of the builders who reject this stone, for bi metalism can be accomplished, but silver must necessarily be considered as a flexible factor in the scheme. "TnE Nation" calls attention to the inconsistencies of Mr. Secretary Foster's report and that of the treas urer, Mr. Nebeker, which renders the condition of the treasury very much like a Chinese puzzle. Mr. Nebeker reports the revenue of the govern ment for the last fiscal year at $354, 037,784 and the expenditures at 345, 023,320. Mr. Foster, the secretary of the treasury, does not agree with the treasurer. The figures given out by him show the expenditures of the gov ernmeat for the last fiscal year to have been $301,348,660 and that the revenue amounted to $356,033,302. The difference is that the treasurer has left out its transactions with the na tional bank deposit and redemption funds and has thus transformed a general and actual net deficit of $4,500,000 to a fictitious surplus of $9,000,000, but he is not consistent in this leading method, since if he had followed it in comparison of this year's expenditures with last year's he would have found the deficit not as he says at $10,349,354, but $20,750, 675. The state department last May was threatened with an investigation of the official conduct of Minister Pat Egau and Consul McCreary to Chile, but congress b7 courtesy yielded to a request of the department to permit it to make the Investigations. It has been postponed from time to time neither Egan nor McCreary nae returned to Chile, but since Mr liar- risou's defeat, like Othello, lb. y are without occupation. It has ueeu charged time and again that I'gan made a large fortune by questionable mthnd9 in Chile. It is time the state department was clearing its skins by o ln,.octIrratinn into tne IUU luuil m an ijj ivun-"-- the case. TEE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. The president's message to congress hna rlo-ht of wav this morning. It is published in all its essential entirety and almost wholly as sent to congress. It Is a complete review of the condi tion of the government as it exists just beiore it is to be turned over the Democratic party. Great stress laid on the existing general prosperity doubtless not only as taking all the credit of it to the Republican party but as being a mild sort of t dare to the Democrats to do as well There is but little doubt they will pick up the gauntlet and wage a most suc cessful contest. The reference to our relations Canada and the carrying trade that country is doing at our expense cer tain.'y points to a very grave state of affairs and should command tne mosi serious attention of congress. The plea for a subsidized merchant marine is earnestly made and the case nut as stronclv as possible. That the United States should have i thorough merchant marineis undoubt edlv truo but that it should be built up on government subsidy may be a very different question. Most of the message is made up innHfttlnnfi of the ?rand work of the cabinet officers and of course incident ally of Harrison himself. But it con tains a great deal of valuable Informa tion and should be carefully read by every one. There was one point in Professor Briggs' opening speech in his defense before the New York Presbytery that must have struck consternation to the members of that body. He said- "Have you considered what will be required of you if you consent to this proposal of the prosecution? It will ha nnmnBurv for vou to eniDlov a read er to read to you alltheconteats of the . . . . T 1 Standard! of tne cnurcn, an oi rxoiy Scripture, the entire Inaugural Ad dress and all of my writings referred to therein. You are required by law to have all the proposed evidence be fore you."

MEDICAL PROFESSION IN OHIO ALIVE AND DETERMINED TO LEAD THE WORLD. Extract From a Lecture at the Surgical Hotel, Columbus, 0., on Chronic Catarrh by Dr. S. B. Hartman. Catarrh is the coutinual scourge of Christendom. It hovei nuiousiy over every city and neetlno ueacher ously in every hamlet. It Hies with vampire wings from country to coun try and casts a black shadow of dis pair over all lands. Its stealthy ap proach and its lingering stay makes it a dread to the physician and a pest to the patient. It changes the merry laugh of childhood to the wheezy breathing of croup and the song of the blushing maiden to the hollow cough of consumption. In its withering grasp the rounded form of the fond wife and mother becomes gaunt and spectral and the healthy blush of man hood turns t the sallow, haggard visage of the invalid. Cough takes the place of conversation, speech gives way to spitting, the repulsive odors of chranic catarrh poisons the kiss of the fondest lovers and thickened mem branes bedim the sight, impair hear ing and destroy the taste. Like the plague-stricken Egyptians a cry of distress Las gone out from every household, and the mildew of woe clings to every hearthstone. Catarrh in some form, catarrh in some stage lurks as an enemy in the slightest cough or cold and finishes its fiend ish work in heart disease and con sumption. No tissue, function or or gan of thH body escapes its ravages; muscles wither, nerves shatter and se cretions diy up under its blighting presence, bo stubborn and difficult of cure is this disease that to invent a remedy to cure chronic catarrh has been the ambition of the greatest minds in all ages. Is it, therefore. any wonder that the vast multitude of people who have been cured by chronic catarrh by Pe ru na are so lavish in their praises of this remedy? That the diEcovery of Pe-ru-na has made the cure of catarrh a certainty is not only the testimony of the people, but many medical men declare it to be true. As no drugstore in this age of the world is complete without Pe-ru-na it can be obtaiued anywhere with di rections for use.

TRIP TO THE IRON CITY. SMOOTHLY GLIDING OVEE THE AUSTIN AND NOKTHWESTEElf. Admirable Bailway Service Eunning Thro' a Country Beautiful Beyond Descrip tion Llano and her Immense magnetic Iron Deposits. Accepting an invitation from Cap tain Leitnaker, the efficient superin tendent of the Austin and Northwest ern railroad, a Statesman representa tive yesterday stepped into one of the elegant new coaches for a trip to Llano, the future iron center of Texas. The train was in charge of handsome George Penn, one of the most compe tent conductors in the South, and with Dan McNamara at the throttle, and with Sam Gaut feeding the snorting iron steed, the scribe felt sure that his millions were in no immediate danger of disbursement among his heirs. Captain l eitnaker had delegated Mr. R. J. Swaucoat, general claim agent of the road, to watch the reporter to see that he was neither lost, strayed or stolen on the trip. At the conductor's signal the train slowly moved out from the depot gathering speed as it passed around the curve ai; Govalle, through the lovely valley dotted by cosy larui houses embowered in luxuriant shrub bery and pretty native trees; through the postoaks now rapidly shedding their summer robes of green, with an occasional Spanish oak gorgeous in its many colored foliage, ranging in tints from burnished gold to crimson red. as though blushing because ot the stolen kiss by saucy jack frost; then there is a modest cedar with its never chang ing green, emblemetic of immortalitv, whiie the stately live oak stands out above all, proudly waving its green branches.detying the winds of heaven and the blasts of the storm king its heart repelling the stroke of the wood man's axe and its fibre mocking the ravages of decay typical cf the Southern race, its stout heart as theirs and its everlastine foliage as their un dying fealty to country and their fel low-man. We are out on the great billowy prairie now. The iron horse, like a blue-blooded racer, is training speed with every bound. Swiftly we fly, but so smoothly over the finely ballasted roadbed that reading and writing are as pleasant as in The Statesman's luxuriously upholstered sanctum. We look westwaid and the eye rests pleasantly on the mountains through which the Colorado cut her bed ages ago. The mountain tops are countless, ranging back until blended with the hazy atmosphere. Their sides are covered with the sombre green of their cedar garb and the imagination pictures the sunny slopes, the rugged cliffs and the sylvan glens hidden iu their deep recesses. Then arises a mental vision of the glorious lake to be formed by Austin's great dam the broad expai-se of piacid water, the shady bayous formed by water backed up iuto debouching creeks and ravines, the merry picnic parties with happy youths and maid ens clambering up the mountain sides. But while we are dreaming Engineer Dan has been putting spurs to his steed and we dash into the first sta tion, Watters, where a new seo tion house and a large, new water tauk reflect the enterprise of Superintend ent Leitnaker. The run to Cedar park consumes but a few minutes, and atter Postmaster Emmett Cluck has takn off the mail a short ran through the blackjacks brings us to the famous Bagdad prairie, which is famed for its fertility and beauty. Here is Leander, a pretty little vil lage on the prairie, having five stores, shops, gins, etc , and is the 'center of a fine trade. Liberty Hill comes next, the largest town between Austin and Burnet, with several stores, shops, gins, hotels, livery stables, etc., and especially noted lor its excellent schools A pretty new depot building with orna mental lawn and a large section hove betray more of Capt. LeituuUer's pen chant for disfiguring the face of ma ture. Bertram comes nexi a fine cotton market and a point from which a great deal of grain has been shipped this season. Improvements and evidences of thrift are seen on every baud. Here we strike the mountains. The soil is covered with shinoak with lux uriant herbage on which vast herds of horses and cattle keep fat and sleek. In the distance on either side of the road vast mountain chains loom up, and on the long slopes cozy farm houses and cleau fields are spread out to view as ou an artist's cauvas. We reach the summit of the moun tain chain, 1550 feet anove sea level and 900 above Austin. The air is pure and the invigorating breeze suggests that a reef be taken in your wraps. For the first time since leaving Austin there is a jar in the train's motion as Dan throws on the air brakes to ease her down grade. Post Mountain rears his hoary head to our right and at the giant's feet we see nestling the lovely little Granite City, Burnet The train does not go up to tbe business part of town, but enough is seen from the car window to indicate the business activity of the growing city. The public square is surrounded by a row of substantial twe-story stone buildings. Numerous church spires and school buildings attest the religious and educational standard of Burnet's inhabitants. Several miles down the rond at Fairland. the Marble Falls branch takes off. Here u a depot building that takes the eye of every railroad man that sees it. From the arrangement of the win dows the telegraph operator can see up and down both branches of the road without leaving his seat. The story is told that a prominent railroad official asked Captain Leitnaker for a blue print copy of the architect.' Han of the building. "We never had any sketch," he replied. "I stuck a peg iu the ground here and another one there and then made a roucrh profile sketch on a shingle and told the fore man or construction to put up the building." At Fairland is tbe elegant home of Hustler Holloway (he was not bap- BURKS f.:IO SCALDS, are quickly relieved by applying Russia Saive.

Starting out from Fairland down Baokboue vallev the road runs seven miles in a line as straight as engineer ing science could make it. Over to the left is historic l'acksaddle moun tain, to the right is stately Backbone mountain, through whose granite ribs miners are piercing a shaft in search of nature's hidden treasure. Round ins the mountain's po'nt we pas into Hoover's valley and cross the Colorado river on a steel bridge 1)00 feet long,, set on massive granite piers that will defy the Uol orado's torrents loner after the cunning brain that planned it has performed its earthly (unctions and gone hence. We run along the bank ot the Llano river to Hessemer, where active mm ing operations are being conducted by a wealthy corporation of which Colo' nel Scbryver. of San Antonio, is presi dent, the shaft is now 80 leer dee and prospects of obtaining pay in:, quantities of high grade Bessemer ore grow Drighter daily. THE IRON CITY. Llano, the future great, the embryo 1'ittsburg of the west, greets our vis. ion as we turn up the river bank. We glide into the pretty new depot and ou oui- right see a number of two-story brick and granite busine3s houses, while to the left, across the river, lies the old town, a splendid new irou bridge just completed (.panning the river, connecting the old town ' with the new. TheAlgona, a $05,000 hotel, would be a credit to any city in Texas. From its roof a grand view'i had of the sur rounding country, its irregular moun tain ranges lofty peaks and fair fields a veritable panorama of nature, ever changing with each change of view and each vieing with the prt ceding oue for beauty. On the north side of the river are several large wholesale and retail mercantile establishments, ap parently doing a profitable traffic, an ice factory, several lumber yards and other business ' enterprises. On the south side the public square was a lively scene, merchants busy, country peop'le coining in and going out, every thing indicating a healthy state of trade. The new court house is going up rapidly. It te situated ou a solid foundation of pink and white marble, the base being of granite, walls of brick with granite trimmings and pillars, it will be a thing of beauty. Pending its erection the county officials ate. located in a building near the Square, where County Clerk M. M. Hargis was found as "happy and jolly as of yore. All the merchants reported business good and U;.l. Moore of the Iron City national bank was especially elated at tha high p.-ire of cotton. Ou the north side tbe Llano lm provemeut and Furnace Cjuipiny ap pear to be the prime factors iu build ing up the city, and iIr. Fnn.k Jla lone, its president, is the utainspriM oi tne company, ms enthusiasm is exceeded only by Llano's bnu.dlss resources and the work his company has done is an achievement he has a right to be proud of. Llano county is the treasure vault of Texas as to valuable mineral ores aud economic stones. Among the stones found in paying quantity s an.l available to work are correctly mt f arth in a leaflet of the Improvement, and Furnace company, a to, lows: ''Granite is fouud in prolusion itud in great variety as to both color nnd texture There are over twenty s) vies of granite from as many teparate de posits. On the company's town cite is a deposit of millions of cubiii feet of n coarse red granite, while on th same property, not more than two or thioe blocks from the ho: el, is a large deposit of blue granke .o fine in texture that a glaxs is ri'Vtl'd to distinguish the particles of quariz, mica and feldspar composing the s'oue Five or six miles north is an immense field of gray granite, said by experts to closely resemble, and tj equal, the Quincy eranite of Massacauseits. The red granite of which the new Texas state house is built is from the Lla no Burnet granite fields. Ou the town site property is a large deposit of rib bon'marble. Five or six miles south is one of a very beautiful white mar ble, near which, again, is one of cloud ed marble, white and blue. In the town of Llano is an outcropping of blue limestone, which appears to ba like the blue limestone of southern Indiana, from which the Indiana state house was built, and which has been shipped to New England. Other lime stones are found in limitless quanti ties. An eighteen-mile range of lime stone hills, not far from town, contains enough of the material for the build ing and fluxing purposes ot a dozen Pittsburgs. But grand as are the prospects of Llano, based upon her i,reat variety of natural products, the lias another resource which is rapidly making her famous throughout the United State-". The South has already grown gi eat in the eyes of the world in her onward march of industrial progress: but she has all along telt the want of a Bes semer iron ore district from which to draw her supply of material for steel making. And now comes Llano with exhaustless mines of the Duett Besse mer steel ore on the American conti nent." Analyses of Llano ore3 compared with other commercial ores no iu u ie demonstrate that the Llano county ores are richer iu metalic iron than those of any of the Lake Superior re gions, the famous Cornwall ore bank, or the Santiago de Cuba mines; thnt the percentage of phosphorus is ex ceedingly small, and so far below the Bessemer limit'as to establish beyoLd doubt the utility of the ores for steel making by the ordinary or acid pro cess; that the value of the Llano c.-unty ores is enhanced by the notable ab sence of sulphur in their composition; that tbe element of silica enters into the composition of the ores only in a very low percentage, which would in no wise prove detrimental in iron or i steel-making. With such valuable ores in unlimited quantities the future of Llato depends only on the enter prise ot her people. The Llano Im provement and Furnace company have shipped ore to 13irminghnm and the tet was satisfactory. Tins company i s pushing its inking enterprises and hopes ere long to have them so far de velnped as to attract capital to erect rolling mills. In the olliee of the Algona hotel are exhibited rocks aud minerals in great variety, some of immense value, chief among which is probably an excellent quality of lithographic stone. THE 

AUSTIN AND NORTHWESTERN, After four hours sight-seeing the train was boarded for the homeward trip. As going out, the train ran rap idly aud smoothly. Few railroad men in the country can show such a record as can Capt. L?itnaker in his manage ment of this road. He has been in the railroad busdijes twenty-eight years, twenty of which he has been manager. He knows railroading from the section hand to the top round. When he took hold of the Austin and Northwestern it was a miserable little narrow gauge that could not furnish comfortable transportation for a cow, much less a human passenger. Slowly but surely the property was built up. tae granite traffic wus judiciously handled and the revenue derivr d was expended for the betterment ot the road, always with a view to making it a standard gauge. Ten months ago his hopes were realized, aud active work was begun. Today it is perhaps the smoothest roadbed in the south; its new, freshly paiuted depots are mod els, each having its lawu set iu ber muda grass and or na marital shrub bery; 100 bridges on the line, 17 of them irou: steel cattle guards; every thing whitewashed from one end of the line to the other, aud a tire guard wherever there is a possibility of lire. The passenger cars were built espec tally for this road and are not sur passed for elegance and comfort by those of any other road in the south. Captain Leitnaker is very kind to all employes, wincn makes him highly popular with them and insures faith ful service. A trip over the road as now managed is a pleasure and one who rides over the road once will agree that the Granite Mountain Lin? is hard to beat. FIFTY -SECOND CONGRESS. ITS SECOND 8E8SION WILL BE VENED THIS MORNING. CON- There Will Probably be Much Talk, Little Legislation Immigration Ex clusion Will be Brought Forward. Also Sunday Closing of the Fair. but Washington-, Dee. 4. The second session of the F;fcy second congress, which begins tomorrow, will likely be more remarkable for discussion than action. Not that there ard not very many things to be done, if the bulky calendars of the senate and house are put-, in evidence, but principally be ea'iseof a l ick o! opportunity or of in-tvitii-rioti. The thing that must be done ami will be done is to provide for the maintenance of the government, and it is generally believed the regular annual appropriation bills will represent nearly all of the positive achievements that can ba credited to this session. There may, however, be several iui portanc exceptions. One of them re lates to the subject of immigration. The public iutereot in this subject which was awakened last summer by a fear of the cholera epidemic has been stimulated by the radical sugges tion of the senate immigration com mittee that ail immigration be sus pended lorayear. Undoubtedly pow erful influences will be brought, to bear to compass the defeat of any bill embodying such a proposition, but it may be that the great public senti ment behind it will oblige congress to pass the measure. A strong effort will certainly be made to secure the repeal of the Sun day closing clause of the World's Fair act. It may be too that tome action will be taken upjn the s jhj-c-1 which the president lias repeatedly called the attention of congress, namely, the desirability of legislation to protect railway employes Irom the numerous casualties resulting from the absence of a suitable device to couple and stop freight trains. These matters comprise what tl.e best judgment concedes to be all the probabilities of original legislation on the part of the second session of the Fifth-second congress. No one expects any tariff legislation in either house, but the subject if so much in volvtd in the revenue question and in appropriations to be made that more or less division on that topic may be expected. The anti-option bill has advanced so far as to become unfinished business in the tenate. It was known (o have a large majority of that body in its lavor last session upon direct vote if one could have been reached but it is threatened with renewal of the determined and skilful obstructive tactics which then proved successful aud the result is still doubtful There will probably be many propositions and much talk this Sdssion locking to reforms iu the national banking laws, a nece-'i-ity lor which is still to ba in dicated by the Keystone and Mavt rick bank failures. The state bank tax may also be a fruitful theme of dis cussion and Al iauce senators aud representativ s v. ,11 be heard upon some cf .i.. if "radical propositions. These matters, however, are likely to be simply themes for .discussion with out action. Strong efforts will be made by the house appropriations committee to retrench expenditures at every point, but as this must be done with great care in order to avoid em barrassment to the incoming Damo cratic administration, there may be mauy.stormy debates and much teel ing aroused before the desired result is obtained. In the tenate the vice president will appoint a committee to wait on the president and notify him that the body is ready to receive any communi cation he may desire to make. To this committee will be imparted the information that the president will communicate to the senate the next day, whereupon adjournment will iouow. Thohoure will hold a brief session during which the customary re3olu. Hons will be adopted for the appoint tueutof a joint committee to notify the president that congress is ready for business. m . i .1 : . j ing the recess, Messrs. Warwick, of Ohio, and McDonald, of New Jersey. The house will adjourn as a mark of respect lo their memory as soon as in telligence is officially communicated to it.
