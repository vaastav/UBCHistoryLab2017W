Wheat in all the markets of the world took a very sudden upward torn in price a short time since and ia still going up like a barometer in am exposed place during the early af ternoon hours of a warm August day. The reason for this was a bit occult to idle average optio. Market reporters and dealers who do not see beyond the end of their nose referred it to an apparent; dry year in California, a proposition in which there is neither truth nor Bense. Others alleged it was due to the fact that France would need a large supply of foreign bread staffs. In thia theie really is some thing. France ia a buyer, and so is Germany, and [when these countries buy, wheat cannot rule low. But that Fra nee would be in the market had been known for many months. That Germany is there is not due to a abort crop at home, but to an unusual demand. That demand is the key to the situation. It is the fear of a gen eral which has made Germany a buyer of wheat. It is that fear which has sent wheat up so suddenly in all countries. The war ia over the disemberment of Turkey. One thing is certain—that Russia will be a party in the fight. Her usual wheat supplies will be cut off from Western Europe for one or more sea sons. Another thing is almost cer tain— that is that all Europe will be drawn into the [contest, on one side or the other, and sooner or later. When it comes down to close specu lation as to how the great armies will be mars hailed there is a good deal of doubt. England is more than likely to espouse the cause of Turkey in order to secure, first, her bonds held by the l'orte, and secondly, a share of the Sultan's dominions when the dismemberment takes place.SfAustria will be on the name side, for the last of the reasons in the case of England. How France and Italy will stand is uncertain. They are jealous of England, and therefore likely to come to an rfifftife cordiale with Russia. But, after all it ia Germany who holds the key to the situation. How will the great military Empire cast her lot? That no one will know until the act is done. She may stand aside, and see all the contestants exhaust their strength and their resources, and then step in and take the greater part ol the prey from the teeth of all "the dogs of war." She may join one aide or the other at any stage in the game. Whatever she does it will be with an eye single to the interests of herself and for her own aggrandize ment. It does not yet appear to an outsider with which side these inter ests may best be subserved. It prob ably is not yet clear to Germany her self what action she had better take. She will let the others take their sides, come to blows, and thus reveal the probable turn in the great tide of affairs, and be guided by these ile velopments. In' t any case she will keep herself in a position to play the arbitrator or dictator between the two sides and take her toll from both National hanks are certainly on their last legs. The last calls for bonds have greatly curtailed their circulation, and the $75,000,000 of three-per-cents still outstanding can not escape being called within the next two or three months. In fact, they should be called at once. That will force this amount of money to seek investment in some industrial channel and thus aid business and trade. Theie is an effort making in certain quarters to allow the banks to deposit silver bullion or coin with the Government, as a guarantee for the circulation of these banks. It is a measure which should not succeed. It is not denied that the national banks have been well managed in the main. It is not denied that they have proved of great convenience to the people, as compared with the old lo cal banking system. But it is denied tbat as good or even a better system may not be devised. It is denied tbat there is any further reason for I tbe preiervation of the present sys tem. At best, there are in the sys tem the two worst elements of Re publican policy. One is paternalism ; tbe other is discrimination in fa- Hor of capital. It is an interference ictf the Government in business. That ia paternalism. The less we have of ,It the better. The more the people attend to their financial, industrial ■and commercial affairs without direct contact with the government, the better it will be for the government and the governed. Then it is lend ing the credit of the government to certain individuals for the personal benefit of those individuals. It may be said that the privilege is free to •11. Not so. It is a privilege which only capitalists can benefit by. Now let us have a law and a system which tbe rich and poor alike can share in tbe benefits of. Give us free coinage of silver, and the right to get silver certificates for silver bullion, and for ■direr coin. I-et the miner have the right to take his one hundred ounces of silver to the mint and convert it into dimes or dollars, or let him take if to the sub-treasury and get silver notes in such denominations as he choses. Let him get one hundred $1 notes, or one $100 note as he sees lit. This will relieve the country of all trouble on this head, and allow the , poorest and the richest the same I rights and privileges. Democracy can make itself solidly popular with the people this year in one way ; and failing to work in that way, it will loose more or less of the good name it at present enjoys in the Union. The way is to take decisive but conservative steps to remodel the tariff schedule. Republican papers profess to see an inconsistency in the President's message, because he want* the tariff reformed with as little disturbance to business as pos sible. Such pretense is of course the most insincere and silly thin* in the world. Such papers think of noth ing but their party, and care nothing for it but to keep it in power. Bereft as they are of all patriotism, the nar row partisan prejudice that rules their utterances, leads them to elesire one of two things—either that the Democrats would adopt Morrison's horizontal bill, or else do nothing at all. The tariff can be remodeled without serious disturbance to busi ness. There are industries which have heed fostered under the wing of the war tariff schedule which are now so strong that they can stand on their own feet and not suffer collapse, nor even be crippled by a lowering of the tariff now on similar imported goods. There will follow a great relief to the people upon any just and efficient revision of the tariff. The people think this, and demand that it shall be put into practical operation. Great hopes are entertained that the Sweet Wine bill will pass Con gress during the current session. It, by all means, should pass, and doubt less can be got through by proper work. It is opposed by the prohibi tion wing of the Republican party and by makers of fruit brandy in cer tain par sof the Union. Reasons can be shown both these opponents why they should aid in the passage of this bill. But the wine-makers should send a man to Washington who is well posted in the whole mat ter—who will aid our representatives to get the bill past the two houses. Much good was done in this way at the last session. The measure is not past danger by any means, and no risk should be run. We do not re call any member of Congress from Ca lifornia who has that intimate, prac tical knowledge of this subject,which gives promise of a successful prose cution of it before that body. By all I means let a well qualified man go on early and work with the California delegation in this matter. I Exemplification of tba fairness of disposition usually found among good Democrats crops out in the case of Hon. J. Marion I.rooks. He is elect ed a member of the Assembly from the joint district formed by the coun ties of Kern and Ventura. His Re publican opponent has alleged that Brooks was elected by fraud. He has been threatening a contest. Al though by a technicality of the law Mr. Brooks could bar such contest at the present stage of the game, he wishes to make the announcement for himself that he is ready to waive all such merely technical grounds. He will allow his opponent to go on and contest. Furthermore, he challenges said opponent to make such contest. He will be disappointed if his oppo nent does not make the contest. Since writing the article on the Sweet Wine Ball, which appears in these columns to-day, we learn that the wine-makers of this section met yesterday and chose J. Deßarth Shorb, Esq., to visit Washington for the purpose. There could not be a more fitting selection made. Mr. Shorb is in every way most admir ably fitted for this work. It is much to be regretted that this gentleman finds it incompatible with his busi ness engagements to perform the im portant service for this section and for the whole State. The earliest possible action Bhould be taken to name some other well qualified per son to perform this important duty for Califo: nia sweet wines. Democratic efficiency in olfice is most clearly exemplified in the case of Judge linger, the Collector of the Port of San Francisco. He has made his deputies a genuine terror to opium smugglers. These officials are as alert as wild cats, and as cunning as foxes, in their vigilance and schemes to stop this illicit traffic in the terrible drug which is the curse of China. Hardly a steamer comes into the bay that a seizure of more or less magnitude is not made. It must be that under so watchful and wise a policy this smuggling of opium will soon be put a stop to. Hager de serves the greatest credit for the way in which he is enforcing the laws. The greatest gratification will be felt by all good citizens at the news of the President's Improved health It would be a very great calamity should anything serious interfere with the President's personal admin istration of the government. There is no Vice-President to take Mr. Cleveland's place in case of any dis ability. The earlier news of yeater terday was of an alarming nature, but a later dispatch sets this canard at rest. j TOS
