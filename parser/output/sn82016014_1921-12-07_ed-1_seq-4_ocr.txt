This Service bureau is located In the national capital, where it Is in immediate touch with all the Ki'eat resources of the United States government. It can answer practically any question you want to ask, but It can't give advice, or make exhaustive research. The war forced so many chances in the dailv life of the American people that the service of this Information bureau will be invaluable to all who use it.

Announcement by the labor board tliat new working rules to replace the national agreements which lor a long "time have been excessively costly to "the railroads will be ready soon indi ""cntes that the lubject of further wage readjustments can be taken up at an Xarly date. During the first seven months of this year, according to the Interstate commerce commission sta tistics, the railroads paid their em ployes $1,671,349,530 in wages, which was 01. 3 per cent of the total operat ing expenses for that period. In July, according to the commission, the car riers paid out fl2.030.154 in over time compensation. Of this amount $"1,439.11)8 went to trainmen and en gincmen engaged in the transporta tion service. Of the remaining $6.599. DSC, a total of $3,871,610 was paid as punitive overtime. It 19 ex pected that the roads will be freed from much of this extra compensa tion by the new rules. The Wisconsin federation of wo men's clubs, at its annual convention, - launched a campaign againit bill boards along highways. It is stated in resolutions addressed to the state highway commission and members of the legislature that the roads are not tho place, for advertising bigus, be cause of their detriment to natural beauty, and it is suggested that the newsptiperl is the more legitimate me dium thru which the retail merchant FhouM seek patronage. I'robably a large majority of tho inhabitants of the entire country agree with the "Wisconsin club women. An observer in Montreal estimates that American tourists brought $1,000,000 a week into Canada this year, and word comes from Quebec that $35000,000 was left in that prov ince alone. It will be seen, therefore, that despite prohibition thin emintry still is paying a heavy liquor bill. There remains less than three weeks in which to do Christmas shop ping. , Despite frequent warnings some will go rushing around the day before ChrisLnias, indignant that there is a certain depletion in the Christ mas stock from which they desfre .to select; annoyed that the clerks who wait on them may not show so much enthusiasm as may be desired; irri tated as they realise that even if they succeed In getting what they want the articles will in all probability fail to arrive in time to go into the Christ mas stockings of the persons who are to be made glad by them. Yet there lias appeared from year to year much improvement in this regard. There can be found many persons at this time who have their Christmas pres ents already bought and tied up. How they must be envied by the procrastl nators! About a billion dollars of the new budget is for interest on the public debt. That figure could be cut in half if the European nations that owe us money would make regular payments of their Interest. But congress prob ably would find some other way to spend easy money like that. Ono hundred and thirty-six taws were enacted in the six month of the first session of the present congress and scores of others are pending Jn various stages of legislation, ready to be taken up again. The mora impor tant bills enacted into law are as fol lows: Internal -Tevenue act, budget act, emergency 'tariff extension act, peace resolution, veterans" bureau act, immigration act. anti-beer act, $25, 08 3,000 farm loan act.javy and army appropriation acts, grain futures act, packers' control act, war finance ag ricultural loan act, $75,000,000 state highways aid act, maternity act, ship ping board act, export aid act, cable control act, Indian bureau act. Sev eral of these might have been omit ted without injury to the country. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. A considerable portion of President Harding's first annual message to congress takes on the character of a lecture on the advantages of a get together policy. He suggests rather than urges or demands. While much consideration is given to the subject of a permanent tariff enactment, what the president says on the subject might easily give rise to the impression that he is discharg ing a. partisan duty. His language does not possess the true high pro tective ring. It teems possible that the Fordneys and the Penroses may regard him. as a heretic. The president expresses satisfaction with what has been done in the di rectio . of tax reduction but lets it be known that he Coes not regard it as enough. Ile promises further recom mendations at some future time. In suggesting a constitutional amendment which would forbid fu ttrfe issuance of non-taxable securi ties Mr. Harding aligns himself with those who believe in taxing the peo ple on their indebtedness as well as on what they possess. It is doubt ful that this recommendation will he favorably received by congress but if it should be adopted it could not be come effective for several years, so there appears to be little cause for immediate worry on that score. It might, however, make serviceable materia in a political campaign. That portion of the message de voted to the -relations of capital and labor should receive tho thoughtful consideration of every citizen of the country. It calls attention to the in terdependence existing between the two groups and points out the neces sity for a tribunal which shall have power to settle disputes between them, and thus eliminate the strike and all other forms of industrial war fare. The message on the whole Is marked by an absence of any radical ideas and is in decided contrast to those to which congress has been lis tening for some years past. 

THAT MISFIT TAX BIIX. Congress again is in session and it appears not at all improbable that it will be driven by popular clamor to undertake revision of the revenue law passed just before adjournment. While the bill made reductions in cer tain tax schedules, it seems to be no more understandable than the old law and the cost of collection prom ises to remain as high as ever. Already I'-.ose who have given the new law careful attention .point out that the meaning of :. disturbing num ber of provisions is shrouded In mys tery by tite language employed, and that more questions even than in the old law mu t be left to interpretation and. ruling by the revenue depart mOTit. How sJch situations work out is shown by the steady increase in cost of collecting the taxes for 1921. Ac cording to the annual report of the bureau of internal revenue, tax re ceipts of the government during the fiscal year decreased nearly a billion dollars aj compared with the previous year, while the cost of collections in creased 32 r nts for each $100. Tho cost administering the inter nal revenue laws for the year wag, in round numbers, $40,000,000, or 87 cents for each $100 collected, com parer with 55 centn for the preceding year. Some of this extra cost was due to administration of the prohibition and nr.rcotic laws, but outside of these the expenses were over $33,000,000, or an equivalent of 72 cents for each $100 in tax s collected. The joport blames the Increased cost mainly to reduced collections and increased expense in enforcing the regulatory laws. There was also, it says, an additional expense, by reason of the enlargement of the income tax organization, in order to facilitate the completion of the audit of the 1917 and 1918 returns, and to enable the office to adjust a large volume of con tested claims that had accumulated. The force last year of the Internal r .venue bureau was about 2.500 men. The obscure and complicated charac ter of tax provisions has kept the bu reau three or four years behind on checking up, and -now it has been compelled tj enlarge its force. This is striking contrast with the cost of Elections of the sales tax in Canada, which the mayor, of Ottawa infor. ed the visiting congressmen took a force of only forty men in the whole province. The Ne Tork American quotes him as follows: My fore consists e'f but forty men. We use various government of fices' thruout the country,' so the cost of collection Is almost nil. We use the 130 so-called superior tax offices in the country, and in very small places the customs officer col lects the tax and turns it jover to the nearest superior tax office. Because of our simple 'method of checking up. there is no fraud. We know instantly what tax is due from manufacturers, wholesalers, jobbers, etc., and we know what every pro ducer in the country is doing. Take a $5 pair of shoes. The manu facturer pays 1 H Per cent, that is 7H cents. The wholesaler or retailer pays a similar amount. The amounts are so small that often the tax charge Is absorbed in the actual cost of goodi to the wholesaler or retail purchaser. The consumer, then, pays only a certain fixed sum and he is not fright ened when he is told the price of an article is so much, plus a sales tax. This encourages purchases. I have talked to and received" re ports from some of the biggest cor porations in the United States with Canadian branches, and they all as sert that there never was a tax so easy to collect and so faultless both from their own standpoint and from an administrative viewpoint, I have not yet come across a single business man or firm that has not said tin sales tax is fair. TOPEKA STATE JOURNAL Information Bureau FREDEK1C J. IIASIvIN, Director, Vasldngton, D. C THE DISARMAMENT ILIASIOX. Washington, TJ. C. Dec. 3. That ali of the disarmament so far discussed at the conference amounts to no more than an agreement among quarrel some men each to throw away an an tiquated blunderbuss which he has in his hand while keeping two loaded automatics, a hand grenade and a dose of strychnine in his pockets, is the way one observer describes the situation here to date. The two most deadly instruments of human destruction so far discovered poison gas and the airplane have not even been discussed. The proposal so far is merely to scrap a few capital ships which will probably be obsolete before the next, war gets under way anyhow. Of course, the real business of tho conference is to try to reach some set tlement of the troubled questions in the Far Kast, which are almost sure to cause war in a few years unless adjusted. There are some signs of progress toward such an adjustment But it is pointed out that the .whole pretension toward disarmament is fu tile unless a more effective program than the present one is evolved. France, next door neighbor of its ancient enemy Germany, has served notice on the world that it has no .n tention of reducing its land forces to a point where there could be danger of successful attack from its prostrate enemy, once it is on its feet again. England, Japan and the United States discuss the ratio their navies shall bear to each other. A serious mulling over of this aspect of the sit uation occurs when it is proposed that the American and British ships shall be matched in strength, with -Japan having three capital fighting ships to every five in the American navy. A counter proposal is made that tho ratio shall be' seven to ten. How About Poison Uas? Whatever the final conclusions on the number of guperdreadnaughts and battle cruisers and tfffe matter of land forces, under arms in the reserve, for all nations, it may mean very little unless effective means can be devised to put a check on chemical and aerial warfare for the future. Chemicai warfare was employed on a large scale in the world war for the first time. Gas, first used by the Ger mans against the Canadian troops, was developed rapidly by both sides, while defense against gas attacks was rushed. When the armistloe was signed, the war was 6 5 per cent chemical, according to military au thorities. The airplane became a tremen dously important factor before the war was over. Planes for all sorts of war uses were developed, ranging from, the small speedy scout and com bat planes to the slower, heavier bombing planes, hospital planes, ana the like. Defense against aircraft at tacks has never reached the effective ness of defense against other forms of fighting. The anti-aircraft gun is highly useful, of couse, but the best defense against the enemy flyers when the war ended was other flyers, to drive them off or bring them down! The trouble with curbing chemical warfare is that the plants- which would be of a tremendous military value in war can be camouflaged into chemical plants of the most innocent looking sort during eras of peace. It is disclosing no secret to say that the chemical experts of all countries are hard at work now experimenting and devising new and ftwful combinations, capable of results far beyond tne most destructive engines of war yet used. The whole world sat up and took notice recently when a commercial plant in a little German town clew up. Some explosive so powerful that TXT is mild by comparison not only wreck ed the plant completely, but destroyed practically the whole town and its population. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the other nations of the world are at least trying to keep pace in the development of destructive .chemicals, so that they will not be caught napping if war should come again. Aircraft forms another fighting arm which can be developed in peace times in apparently unwarlike ways. In this, tho, America is lagging far behind European nations, notably France and German'. Not long ago. a flood of advertising came out of Germany, showing a pretentious plan for air routes of travel from Germany to points all over the continent of Europe and even across tho Mediter ranean to Africa. Tiie French quick ly saw in this a threat to their own safety, and a race for supremacy of the air was begun. Today in Europe traveling by air is a common thing. American railroad men who have looked into it find the United States lagging far behind in this development of transportation. For transportation is the aspect this aerial development wears in peace times.' Aircraft Hard to Limit. France saw in the German plans for extensively developed aerial routes of transportation the means of eco nomically preparing for another war. and immediately set out to pass its ancient enemy in this -respect. Avia tors by the hundreds could be trained and ready for possible war use thru peace time flying. It was the partic ular appeal to the French nation that this sort of war preparation would cost little or nothing, as the commer cial flying experiment and it is about past the experimental stae now could be made almost, if not entirely, to pay for itself. To make certain that this develop ment would not the governments of Germany and France are liberally subsidizing the companies formed for aerial transportation. The flyers cm ployed could be quickly made into military flyers if war should come. Many of the planes in use for com mercial purposes might prove useless, but planes can be turned out at 8 tremendously greater rate than can trained men to operate them. England is lagging behind France and Germany in this development. The threat of future trouble with Germany is not as acute with England as with France. The British honestly hope to be able to keep out of any future fight. However, flying in England is not being forgotten completely, and tho behind its late ally and its late enemy in this respect, is far ahead of the United States. The American Air Service, in both its military and naval branches, hus not been done away with, but in com parison with its one time strength, is hardly more than a skeleton. Tru.s, there are hundreds of former flyers now returned to civil life who coull be called into action if necessary. But when this generation of experienced flyers is gone, or too old to measure up to the strict physical requirements of the air service, America would have to pray for delays while trying to train a new set of flyers. The nucleus of the army and navy flying attack remains, of course. These men are continually flying and seek ing to develop aeronautics ot a mili tary character. However, -the services are not large in their personnel.- The only other governmental move toward training flyers is in the maintenance of the aerial mail service of the post office department. And of these fly ers, the only governmental service out side of the army and navy, there are today but 45 actual flyers. Dorothy Dix Talks BY 

DOROTHY-DIX TTorla's & chest Paid Woman Writ. I.adics Also I. The matrimonial tragedy-of which we hear the most is that of the de serted wife, who at middle age finds that her husband has tired of her, and is Indifferent to her, -even if he has not wandered off after some younger and fairer face. We hear so much of lonely wives, and see so many married womeii working with might and main to keep down their flesh, and keep up their pep, in order to retain their husbands' affections that we have fallen into the way of thinking that matrimony is a perpetual picnic to women, and that it is only men who find it a rainy Sunday with relatives in the country. We accept the fact that the years bring disillusion to tho man. Wa realize how the monotony ot domes ticity gets on his nerves, and how he gets sick and weary of seeing the same face across the breakfast table from him, and listening to the same com plaints, and winding the same clock, and putting the same key in the same door at the same hour every night.. We can see how his passion could cool off as his wife's beauty faded, and her peculiarities increased; how familiarity could even blunt his per ception of her virtues, until the time might come when all he could see in her was just a hon.ely, nagging wom an who sniffled when she talked, and could never let anything rest. Far otherwise is the popular con ception of the middle aged woman. We picture her as sloshing over with romance to her dying day. We ue her in -an attitude of perpetual adora tion before her husband, who contin ues to be the hero of her girlish dreams to the end. We never imagine her as growing tired of domestic life or as perceiving that husband has got ten bald, and bay-windowed, and prosy. lien are especially committed to this view of a woman's heart being a per petual motion machine that never runs down after it is once put in motion, inerefore a man never loses any sleep over the problem of how to retain his wife's affections. He knows that he simply can't lose her and that she is Just bound to go on loving him be cause she can't help it. She's built that way. It appears that there is some slight error in this view of the situation, and that very often the middle aged wo man is Just as tired of matrimony as any man could be, and just as much bored by her husband as he could pos sibly be by her. At any rate, I have gotten a letter from a woman who turns a most interesting searchlight on this matter. She says: .". v "I have been reading some ot- the advice you have been giving to old men who have wearied of the women to whom they -are married, and who want to swap off old wives for new. "How do you know their wives are not tired of them and glad .to have them go? ' A woman of fifty or sixty may be done with romance, of' it may merely be that her husband 'doesn't look romantic to her as he dozes over a newspaper by the fire, end she would like to have a more lively companion herself. If you could look into the minds of old wives you would find many of them are bored to death with their husbands. It is hard to live with a man forty years, and stay in love with him. You know him too well. (Ccpyrlgbt. 1920.

Ours is a high school team and the other is an outride teapi. They want a game with us, but It isn't the honor of winning- the game they want, it is re venge, because we have won other games from them. They py boys rules and we girls' rules. "When we refuse to play them they call ue cowards. Which are we, cowards, or are we doing right? FOUR WONDERS. Since you are accustomed to girls rules it seems to me that it would be foolish to play with a team used to boys' rules. I presume, however, that a fear that the other team will 'win this times does influence you in your refusal to play. Since you have played with the Ovher team before and they have taken defeat, it is only natural that they should want to show you that they can win as well as lose. Theirs is a spirit of conquest rather than of revenge. Dinner Stories "Daughter said the old man, sternly, "I positively forbid you mar rying this young scapegrace!

"The fellow," he said, "is as re sourceful and persevering as the At lantic City girl who wanted a husband.

"The young man addressed gave an embarrassed cough. ' 'Well, you see, ma'am, he said, 'it would hardly be good form. t rescued her yesterday. ON SECOND THOUGHT BY JAY E. HOUSE (From Philadelphia Public Ledger.) Fred Beauvais, out of the picture for many months, has reappeared in the lower left-hand corner. He was in a New York hotel the other day, and those who were privileged to view the spectacle saw a slim, dapper fig ure wearing: spats, brown suit, soft col lar and raglan overcoat. We don't know how you feel about it, but they practically have spoiled Mr. Beauvais for us. We are not unaware of the great work Mr. Beauvais has been doing We do not wish to deprecate it. Bui when a Indian guide takes off his moccasins we lose interest in him. In New York they are cleaning up the saucer-shaped track for another six-day bicycle race. Our interest in the matter is not acute, but we shall peruse the publicity of the event that we may ascertain whether our favorite six-day racer, Oscar Egg, is in it. Tou remember our notion about that? Or. mayhap, you don't remem ber it. Well, we hold, if there must be six-day bicycle races, somebody named "Egg" should win them. The fitting and appropriate ever challenge our seal. One of the column's regular cus tomers reproves it for taking no part in the "dog argument." It would have been necessary to abrogate Rule No. 19 to do so. We settle the "dog question" once every seven years. We had it up in this column in 1918. We are not due to dispose of it again UU' til 1925. The column extends its congratula tions ahd its felicitations to the distin guished Philadelphia gentleman who declined to act as toastmaster at the "Babe" Ruth dinner. We sometimes despair of the so-called human race but always, Just at,the moment when it appears to be slipping over jthe brink of the precipice, some sturdy figure endowed with a sense oi what Is fit and appropriate, rises out of it to check, if not entirely to impede, its descent. v The wolves should go into winter quarters in high good humor. What, with one thins and another, thev have had a highly profitable season, and good pickings are promised for the spring. Mr. Dempsey is reputed to be exacting a fabulous salary for a win ter season of vaudeville, and will be waiting for somebody to take it away from him. "It is my experience." writes R. X., "that if Adelaide had happened to give the overcoat away, Adelaide's husband would have been asking for it within a w-eek. Probably that is true; but there is one thing we never have been able to understand: Why can't a woman let her husband s old clothes a.lone? An old suit or a pair of discarded Bhoes in a closet is as great a temptation to a woman aa drink to a drunkard. An Intriguing Proposition. The reporter who writes the column has received the following letter, which ho takes the liberty to print: The Macksville Enterprise A. Li. McMillan, Publisher Macksville, Kan. "Dear Sir From information which I have gathered from one source and another it' is my belief that you must be the largest single holder of propo sitions on the continent. I have one to make to you. This office is a rip-roarin' good one. and doing a good business, but she is not balanced. The writer and another helper both" past sixty years of age -are old-time printers. To shorten this paragraph would call your attention to copies of the Enterprise sent you under separate cover. The paper needs an editor, and here is the proposition I am offering you. The publisher prides himself on the fact that he is a manager and can and always has dug money out of tne Business. Two men reared fru gally as you and me can live well and save some. The plant, building and all, is valued at about $6,000. There isn't a penny of indebtedness. If you will come to Macksville and take the job of editor you may have a clear title and a bill of sale to a half in terest in the business. Would want you to agree to stay ten years. At the end of that time I would buy your interest back if you should wish to return to work. I might offer many other induce ments, but copy is in for a double-page ad for next week, so must go to work. It's a glad game here. Think it over. a. Li. McMillan. It is a violation of Mr. McMillan's cciitlllicilc-B Ll tllllll. 1115 lELUT, OUt We belie'e the object we have in so doing justifies the act. Many have sought to induce the editor of this paper to decorate us with the order of the bat tered tinware. The urge to have us "fired" seemed always to be predicted on the idea: that should we lose this job we couldn't get another. We print Mr. McMillan's letter to prove that were we separated from the pavroll today and 'today is payday we could be reclining on a bed of dowji a couch of goopus feathers by Thurs day evening at the lates. And. we confess, the offer allures. We leave it to readers of the column as to whether we shall go or say George Matthew Adams Daily Talk SCHAP IT!

Chapter 87. Margaret could not easily give up arguing with Joan. The child never had known what an empty purse meant. While she 'herself had only vague ideas on the- subject. Margaret knew it was decidedly uncomfortable, to say the least. "You see, dear, it isn't as tho you had been accustomed to economizing. You have been- extravagant in little ways always. Even if you live very simply it will cost quite a little. I shall worry myself sick for fear you aren't eating what you should." "Now see here, mumsie!" a bit ot the old impudent tone creeping in. "I have decided to do this, so what's the use making yourself and me miserable about it? If I starve in a garret I'll starve. But after this month's al lowance is gone I take no more money from any one unless I earn it unless I give value received. "You don't care if I worry?" "Of course I do! But if you will just be sensible, you'll see there is nothing to worry about." "You'll come up and have dinners with me?" "That's another thing, mumsie! I haven't time now for any gay parties not often. Ill have Sunday night dinner with you, and once during the week. I planned tnat all out before I told you." "But that will be only two good meals a week. You'll surely get sick." Margaret was almost weeping. Joan laughed uproariously. "What an idea of my talents you have! I surely cannot feel flattered by your faith in me. Why. mumsie! I expect to live on the fat of the land. I shall be a regular female Irvin Cobb, see if I don't, but without his avoirdupois, I hope." Then: "I'm determined, mumsie, so please don't use yourself up trying to dissuade me." Margaret left, turning over in her mind all sorts of plans by which she could relie-e the distress she was sur would follow this Quixotic scheme uf Joan p. "Why couldn't she try first, then if she succeeded give up her allow ance she asked Craig Forrester, in whom she had confided. "You asked her that question. I pre sume. What was her answer?" "That she lacked concentration; that she needed something to push her to give the best there was in her; that sne read cne book a little while and then she laid it down and picked ud and read another instefstl or sticking to the first until she had finished it. Oh, Craig, what shall I do with her? I just know she will make herself ill." "No, I scarcely think that. That crowd she runs with are always shar ing with each other. But what a girl she is!" He used Margarets very word. "Most girls are reaching out for more these days. Whoever heard of one giving up a fat allowance to show she had ability to earn her liv ing? But now -she won't have time for you, so she told you, so you'll have to marry me." "That's further off than e-er. Do you think I would even consider my own happiness whi'e that poor child la struggling away wdithout a maid I'll send Hannah down once a week and earning her own living, or trying to?" "So I'm to be put off again?" "You certainly are? It would break her heart if I should get married, and now that she has to work so hard It would be an awful thing ror me to do." Then: "Don't wait for me any longer, Craig," her voice trembled. "I shall never be able to marry vou." "Oh yes, you will! an take Joan and drown her, as they do young kit tens, before I'll lose you. rteally. Mar garet, what right have you to let that young girl spoil both our lives? I know you care for me, and you know how I feel toward you." "I am to blame for any thing and everything Joan docs. It Is my fault that she is not the usual conventional girl of 18 who hasn't a single serious tnought. If I went too far with her, allowed her too much freenom, it Is my duty to see her thru. Bo far she has come thru all right. row there is this new phase so new to ner that she has no conception of wnat It will mean. She may not be successful, al tho I believe she will.

The great circular lunch counter in the railroad station was a busy spot at all times, but there were breathini! spells" after the heavy express trains from the East and West had pulled out and the lunch counter settled down to its routine of serving the scattered travelers, and even towns people, who liked the well-cooked food and the swift service. One October day after Priscilla Fair had been there two months, and was counted the most rapid of all the deft waitresses, there came a sudden, unexpected rush of customers that filled the stools to the last one. "Pleasj take that one for mo, Pris," begged fat Annie Hardy, as she lumbered past with a plate of clam chowder in one hand and a brimming cup of coffee in the other. She nodded toward the last stool at the circular counter, the one next to the cross-counter. Pris cilla nodded and slipped around the shining urna and faced the waiting customer. She saw a pale-faced man with dogged eyes, who stared first at her, then down at the menu in his hand. When he lifted his glance to her again his eyes were not dogged nor kind nor anything. Just cold and indifferent as becomes a stranger. Priscilla was chilled. Most men and many women looked at her deli- cate prettiness with kind eyes. She had ! a warm, friendly smile, tho acquain tance never developed beyond passing upeottnua l-i n H o ,r '"Choi- n-i ,-1 la 1 recluse!" Annie Hardy, had burst out one day but while we are describing Priscilla, the strange young man 13 waiting hungrily for his order to b3 taken. "Well," prompted Priscilla at last. "Oh," he started, looked at her and rubbed his eyes. '"Bacon and egss and coffee. " he said curtly. Whil she was gone, he read a railroad time table. He was still reading it when she returned with the food which. sno placed before him. y "You are reading it upside down," she said softly. "Reading what?" "The time table." "Oh ," glancing at it and th-ust-ing It into his pocket, "thank you." '"You're welcome going away again soon?" she asked wistfully. "Toniprht," briefly. " Sugar, please." Priscilla pushed JJie sugar bowl toward him and tore check out of the bunch at her waist. "Anything else?" "What have you got that's good ?" "Apple pie." "Sure?" "I made it." "All right I'll take a chance," grudgingly. Priscilla went away. The counters were growing empty. She looked pale and tired. Annie caught her arm. "Y'ou're all in, honey," said the kindly soul. "I'll take care of your order there aud kep your tip. " "No no " cried "Priscilla fiercely. "I'll see to him." Annie laughed shrewdly. "Run along, Pris; first time I've ever seen you notice a man he's just a plain farmer, ain't he?" It was a -pale smile that Priscilla threw over1 her shoulder ns she bore a large piece of fresh apple pie to the stern young man at the counter. Hhe was glad that Murphy, the pro prietor, had agreed to try one of her apple pies and since then she had rarned extra money by making pics or the counter. Murphy's Lunch was famous for its homemade apple pics. After he had eaten the pie, Priscilla Punched the check and laid it beside his plate then she began, to remove the soiled dishes. "Wait." ho said, abruptly. Priscilla waited, her eyes dark, ex pectant. "Have you been here long?" he warned to know. "Two months." "Whe-e did you learn to make apple pies?" . "My aunt showed me how." "Oh! Do you want to know what I'm doing here?" She nodded. "Looking for my wife. She went away from me because I criticised her cootHng. Spunky little thing. And she went away just for that!" He looked hard at her. "You must have said mean things to her," said Priscilla, the pink creep ing into her checks. ''Maybe I did, and maybe I was sorry about it. And after I'd put in a couple 'of loads of hay. perhaps I went to the house to tell her how mean I was and try to make up and found she had gone. Only married three months!" ' "How are you goins: to find her?" asked Priscilla, her white face eager. Hustc&! Is f Li .Jfc Tacoma -Washin&oi Y J Six years ago our Kansas t ily store sobl to ,Jy I.
