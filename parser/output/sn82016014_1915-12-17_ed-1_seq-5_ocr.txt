THE TOPEKA DAILY STATE JOURNAI-FRID AY EVENING, DECEMBER 17, 1915 MAZE OF TANGLES If 9 1 ) Jfew Haven Director Charged With Complicated Finance. Janitor of Portland Building 3Iade a Company Official. New York. Dec. 17. The tangled financial transactions alleged to have been engineered by Edward E. Rob bin, former general counsel of the New York. New Haven & Hartford railraod. to get the steamships Harvard and Yale to the Pacific coast, netted ' him a profit of (691,000, according to the reckoning of the government counsel from testimony adduced Thursday in the trial of Robbins and ten other former directors of the New Haven road, charged with criminal i violation of the Sherman law. In an effort to unravel the skein the government called to the s.and Warren X. Chase of Hartford. Conn., Robbing's chief agent in the dealings. The transactions had their center in Charles W. Morse's defunct Metro politan Steamship company, which owned the Harvard and Yale, and tour freight boats. The government al leges that the New Haven wanted to get rid of the competition of the two passenger steamers and gain control of the freight boats and -.hat in behalf of the New Haven, Kobbins advised the scheme by which it could be done. The scheme included the organization within a month's time of five com panies, maritime and otherwise, and affiliation with as many others. With Robbins pictured as ihe direct .ing genius of the activities- of the com panies, the testimony described the tfwitchinsr back and forth among them of their stocks, bond?, etc., with the nei. result, it appeared, that the Har vard and Yale were leased to the Pa cific Navigation company, one of the new organizations. Kobbins had an alleged profit of $691. 0'JO. the freight boats were sold to the Eastern Steam ship corporation, stock in which was owned by the New Haven, and Rob bins became the owner of 8.000 shares of that corporation s stock personally, both together being enough to con stitute a majority. Warren D. Chase insisted that Rob bins had told him that he had en gaged in the enterprise purely for his personal profit and that he never heard Robbins say the New Haven was interested in it, or knew of any of Robbins's co-defendants having knowl edge of it. How the Metropolitan Steamship company of Maine, No. 2, another of the hastily formed companies, was organized was told by its incorporator. Benjamin G. Ward, a lawyer of Port land, Maine. He said he had formed the company at the request of Chase. "Who were its directors and offi- ; cers '" asked Mr. Osborne. "Well, as I recall them they were Orovcr f. Richards, brother-in-law of my partner. my stenographer. the janitor in my buildlnsr. the assistant janitor and somebody from a theater. Richard." testified that at the re quest of Chase as treasurer of the c'omp.mv he signed checks as high as $1,500,000. A youth at that time.: scarcely over 21. he said, he did not know what the checks were for and : would hve been unable at tne lime iu give anv account of the transactions. KIDS GETTING WISE? Topeka Stores Keep Too Many Santa C'lauws on the Streets for the Youngsters. In their laudable efforts to bring a really truly Santa Clans before the eyes "of the boys and girls of Topeka. enterprising Topeka merchants hnvo played havoc with the childish faith encouraged in many local households. It i a common sight on Kansas ave nue to see two Kris-Kringlcs dodging in and out among the children, passing out candy, waving their hands and arousing the suspicion of the little ones generally. one Santa Claus wears a mask and it doesn't fool the kids, either. They can't understand why their patron saint should hide behind the facial covering. Just as the embarrassed parent settles their inquisitive little minds on this point, along conies an other Santa with pink cheeks. blue eyes and a regular honest-to-goodness complexion. "Why did Santa Claus take off that thing?" asks the child. "Why. mother, they don't look alike at all " "Oh, mamma, there goes one in an automobile ' "Gee. daddy, deres goes another , Santa Claus and he ' What's a feller goin to do?
