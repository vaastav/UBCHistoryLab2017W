The least satisfactory feature, we arc sure, is its lack of directness in dealing with important matters. The most positive statement is that which sets forth President Wilson's views in the Mexican situation. This question is handled with a degree of clearness which seems to us to be lacking in the discussion of the other topics xwith which the message deals. This part of the message affords comfort in that the speedy termination of the Mex. jcan difficulties is predicted with apparent certainty. As to D)r. \Wilson's analysis of the conditions in Mexico there will not be much difference of opinion as to its correctness. The appeal for the immediate enactment of the currency bill is made purely personal. It is the president's earnest desire that this measure he made a law without further de lay, though there is implied doubt as to the outcome of congressional action. The fact that the appeal is made so strongily personal, that the president makes the currency bill a \\'ilson measure, will make patronage-hungry con gressmen reluctant to break with the White House. The farmer receives a lot of consideration in the message. He is given more space than any other factor of the coun tryi life which is discussed. lThie farmer must have, the messagne says, an even break with "other business men and masters of enterprise." We venture the suggestion that a x Ier large percentage of the farmers of the counitry, when they read this clause, will wish that it had been in effect when the free-trade hill was framed. Then, perhaps, they migh t not have seen their own protection destroyed, while duties were retained upon most of the material which they purchase. But maybe the farm-credit system will balance the account, though it will he difticiult to make the farimer believe it. Theli necessity for amendmenlt of the Sherman law is em phasized and a later message is promised, dealing with this question in detail. The president evidently yet believes that he can destrov the trusts and holds that this is better than regulating them. The suggestion for legislation whliich will provide a na tional presidential-primary amounlllts almost to a demand. Mr. iX'ilson rcalizes the menace of the machine in the se lection of presidential noimlinees and this paragraph of his message sounds as if he were getting ready to abrogate the plank in the democratic platform which held him to a one term declaration. But all that is said in the message about presidential primaries is true. It is worth the careful con sideration of congress. "Ultimate" Filipino independence is recommended. The islanders will have to content themselves with this modifi cation of the assurance which was recently given them by their new goverlnor. "'Ultimate" is right. And it will be a long time before the end. The Alaskan situation is another question which the president handles almost with positiveness. He recom mends the construction and operation of railways by the governmient and says it should he hdone soon. i-e declares this to be the only solution iof the problem of protecting the atiural Iresoulrces of the great Alaskan region. Which naturally brings him to the discussion of the conservation question. And there he shies away from the vital issue again. Al most he commits himself t<o a declaration in favor of fed eral control, but he dodges. He is certain that a policy can be frame, which will make agreement easy between the state-right people and the advocates of federal control. However, the president leaves us in the dark as to the de tails of this policy. lie says ''we must bend our counsels to this end'' but he doiesn't start the bending to any ap preciable extent. But the purpose is laudable. Other topics are treated in brief review. On the whole, the message is lacking, we believe, in that element of di rectn'ess which should characteriie the discussion of great issues by a president.
