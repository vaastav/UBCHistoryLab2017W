A, telegram oL Tuesday night nnoun. cd tli evacuation of Fort Pulaski by the Confderateir and the occupation of the Fot bj our forces. This if true is a most importaot victory, as Pulaski commands Savannah. " Charleston S. C, has been visited with terrible conflagration, destroying over $7,000,000, rorth ol property. Tre Confederals Congress has voted an appro priation of $250,000 to relieve distress. We hope soon to be able to record the burning of the lnqt sbinglo and the rais ing the lsst stone of (bat degenerate and treasonable city by tlie guns of our navy. It is said the early surrendering of Ft Beauregard and Ft. Walker at Port Roy al is nttiibutablo to the treachery of the Gormans and Irish to the Southern cause. Fremont had full power to make tho appointments of stibordioate officers for which lie has teen so severely censured and denounced. The artioles In tho Louisville Journal, no severely criticising the President's Message, were written by the junior with out the approval of Pren'.ice, who was in Washington City at the time. Since his return the lone of the paper has been greatly modified for the better. A severe battle was fought in Pocahon tas county, in Western Yiiginia, on the 13th inst., between 2,530 rebels under Col. Johnson, and 1,800 Federals under (Jen. Milroy. A decided victory was achieved by our forces. Loss of the cn pmy 200 killed and 30 prisoners. Our loss 20 killed and 30 wounded. Western Virginia is now chared of the lust rebel fores. ' The country is in hourly expectation of great ttrugle in Kentucky. Our army, 100,000 strong is slowly advancing on the enemy. Samal brigades have cross c 1 Oieea River at Mumfordsvillu. Luck ner'a force at Bowling Green is estima ted nt 40,000. There is a rumor afloat that ab.ittle is going on at New Oi loans, which is gene rally believed. Four Regiments of infant ry and three gunboats (robol) left, Colum bus Ky., on Friday lust for that plitco. Tl battle at Furl Pickens Usied but parte of two ,days. Violory belungj to neither party, but the advantage is deci dedly ours- We sunk two vessels, budly dumnged Forts Daranois and Mdiea ad burnt part of tl.e Navy Yard and the whole of the town if Warrington. CongttiS luve txpclUd the traitors Breckinridge and Burnett of Ky. A resolution bus been introduced in tho Kentucky Legislature, requesting the expulsion of Senator Powell of Kentucky, Tho Military Committee have reported ngsinstlhe bill abolishing the distinction Lolwsen Regulars and Volunteers. The news from Great Britiuin look om inous. Great indignation was expressed nt the arrest of Mason and Blidell. War is not Improbable. Ten Regiments of Indiana and six or eight of Ohio troops have gone iuto Ken incly within tho lust few days. In the matter of ibeiebel itoamer Nasli villo at Southtmpton, England, wannnl was applied for by Capl. Kelson, i f the Harvey Birch, (the ship burned by the Nnsliville) to search fur chroiu meter and oilier property taken by the INaBlivilla on the high seas. The Magistrate doiliued iuing the will unless by consent of the Ouverumeot. And to this application Lord John Russell wroto that be had no power to give authority to the magiatiate either to issue any summons or warruut, or to do, or lo abstain from doing, any thing in rotation to the matter in question and that lis Lordship must therefore de cline lo iuterfure in it. So the question reels fur the pretent. The rebel '.Commissioner from North Carolina, J. L. Peylou, hasaddresHcd a letter to the Times, denying tho existence of any Union feeling in that Stale. A report rosches us from Bermuda, by wy ofllalifsx, that the British gunboat Landrail, on her wuy with dispatches for the British Admiral, list) been stopped by an American corvette, which fired a shot aoross hor bows. The British naval au thorities at Bermuda are lopreecnud to be very indignant about the matter, and to express the belief thtt the act will lead to war. The name of the American cor vette i not given, aaj the whole story lacks eniiGrmatiou, especially as it Is cou pled with the announcement that Mexico has submitted in advanoe to the duinandi of Spain, France and England.' The Chhago Tiibune has reliable au thority for the statement that 6,000 acres of prairie land will be devoted to cotton cultivation the coming ssason. General Prioe is snoamped a hoit dis tanoi below Osceola, with about 12,000 men, and Is in no condition to move. Hie men are poorly rlad, and have not half the tents they need. The result in a greater amount of sickness tl an wjs ever known in 4 camp of that sixe. A letter from to officer in Fort Pick ens, give an sooount of the late affair there, together with an explanation of tho motives which induced Col. Brown to o pen fire opon the rebel fort md battcriet. It seems that the engagement wsa open ed fur the purposs of oreating a diversion in favor of General Sherman, at Beaufort and to prevent the withdrawal of more rebel (roups from Bragg' command to strengthen the rebels at other points like ly to be assailed by our expeditions. The plan succeeded perfectly and forced Bragg not only to stop the transferor his troops in other places, but to ask for reinforce ments for - himself. The fire of Fort Pickens is represented to have been most effective' and only tbe laok of sufficient number of National troops prevented tbe entire discomfiture of the rebels. General Franklin was yesterday furn ished with a copy of the order for tho ex ecution of Wm. II. Juhnson, a private in the Lincoln Cavalry. According to re port, bis offense was deseniou. Suppo sing himsolf to be in the presence of a party of the enemy, he expressed joy that be had made his escape. The offi cer then in'commsnd had a private con versation with him, when he freely and anxiously gave such information as wo'd have been of great importance to the reb els. When his revelations had been con eluded, he was arrested, and, much lo hie surprise, discovering his .mistake, was taken buck to his own camp a prisoner. The execution took place this nfernoon in prosence of about 7,000 soldier's, be longing (0 General Franklin's division. A di tachment of twelve men wore detail ed (or the purpose. Eight of th-n, fired, when Johnson fell on his coffin, but life not being extinct, the other four, in res erve, fired with the requited effect. f uspeclir.g tl.e Puluxeut river boat of carrying contraband gouds, n few days ago, the Marshal delailed a number of of ficers fur ti e purpose of examining. One young lady was disc overt d to have on a skirt we ighing thirty-two pounds. On ex"inma;ion it was found to contain the Client quality and variety uf Hewing silk. A brother of the young lady, ten yenrs of ago, lad conccnled under bis clothes six pounds of quinine. A'hrge vaiitty of other cont raband guods was also found The skirl is now io the possession of the State Department and is an object of cn rioiily. Commnnder Kodjjor's rcconnoicanca has already been followed up by the na val occupation of the newly discovered passage Warsaw Inlet. Our gun are, in that pasagi',bul ten miles from Savan nah, the steeples of which are plainly visible from the decks of our ships as they rido nt anchor there. From their anchorage Savannah may ba approached under circumstances in which it will be utterly defenceless. At any tlmo Genor- al Sherman may be ready, that city must fall into oi.r hund6. Gmeial Sherman is pushing forward, and is expected spoe- di!y to secure the Savannah and Charle ston Railroad. ' The Noifulk people sro in much trepi datiuu by icuron of the daily fi-ar that their city is to be attacked. They say th t tho harbor entrance ought to be at once fortified. Too latel The rohels claim to have thirty nine hundred Union prisoner. Aaoldier of Nehon's brigade was shot near Lebanon, Ky. by Jackson, tho bro ther of tl.e murderer of Ellsworth. The soldier went to the house to make some purohases, when Jackson asked him if ho wss a Lioooln soldier, and instantly fired on him. lie lias been arrested n'jtl tent to Louisville. XfTTh now from England id omin ous of trouble. The British Lion is growl ing toriibly ovor the arrect of Mason it Slidkll. The lone of the British press is insolent in what it is plessid to term s "high ha 1, did outrage upon British rights and gross inBult to tho British flag." If tho Journals of England arc expressing the views of tho Government, wir may be expected as the result. On the nrrost of Mason it Sudell wo have no doubt the Govoi ninont acted in strict conformity with international law and the usuagts of belligerent nations. In 'hi opinion wo are sustained nof on ly by tho American, but by the English view of the subjoi t. The London Tune with most of tho hading English journals admit that their own precedent, as well as the duoissiona of their own courts, justify the arrost, but yielding to tl.e bluster of tho Manchester and Liverpool merchants, denounce, the whole affair as an insult and demand reparation. If under the law of Nations, Captain Wilks had llie right to be aid the Trent and lake from her the rebel CuinuiisHiun- ers Mason and Slidoll, the English Mer chants miy bluster and tho Rritiiih Lyon growl lu vain, and we will hold to the traiturs in pito of both. A war with Engluud would be a terrible thing, but not half so terrible as a disgraceful and humil iating sui router or the Nation's right. We havo a large coutract on hand in the suppreuion of roUllior. at homo, but if necessary to vindicate our honor and maintain our rights, wo wi.l add to it the vOnqueat of Canada.
