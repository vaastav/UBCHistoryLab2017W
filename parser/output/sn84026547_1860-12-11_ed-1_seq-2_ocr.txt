The following correspondence of the Peters burg Express gives what wc have reason to believe is a fair and Impartial statement of the reeling existing at this time with regard to our national exigences in the Congress of the Uni ted States. The wiiter is gifted in the use of language. Read and reflect on the condition of things he sets forth : There is much feeling and but little talk among the Representatives at present. They xpeak of their wishes and hopes fearfully m conversation, but breathe not a word of their intentions. They feel the importance of their position, and like a man preparing for some Herculean task, they seem pausing to take breath to gain strength and receive wisdom. Or rather perhaps they may be considered to act as men feeling the importance of the task before them and diffident of their abilities to perform it I say this through no disrespect, for while I believe there can be found nobody of that character to compare with our Repre sentatives in wisdom. I think it may also be asserted with equal truth that never has a body been convened for considering, or called in discharge such arduous measures, such ter rible duties as those which now lie before the House of Representatives.

"At the present time, when there seems a fear in some quarters as to repudiation of debts by the Southern trade, it is as well to look at facts. If our merchants are questioned, wc Khali probably learn that during the last "0 years there has been as little loss in the South cm business by bad debts as in any other sec tion probably less. They know that the pro portion of sound, substantial dealers is as great nt the South as in any quarter: that their stan dard of punctuality is as high. Why, then, should a temporary scarcity of money there, and some delay in remit tance, if there is any, induce a doubt of men who have always met their engage ments ? There may be political disunion, but commercial intercourse will centinue, .and the honor and credit of a Southern merchant w ill continue as dear to him as it is to any one in New England. And while we would incul cate confidence towards those whom experience has shown to be reliable in the past Ave should hope that cur own standard of faith to ward the South would be quite as highthat bills against Southern produce be punctually met, so that confidence may not be needlessly impaired, and every facility be furnished the Southern merchants to meet all obligations. The Taunton (Mass.) Republican, a Lincoln paper, speaks out against the Massachusetts and other Personal Liberty bills. Wc quote : "So long as the clause of the Constitution, respecting those 'who owe labor or service in one State, escaping into another,' remains in that instrument, and so long; as the Fugitive lve law is a statute of the land, we regard it ns an unfortunate thing that any Sta?e should seem to evince a disposition to render nugatory a provision of the Constitution, or to nullify an act of Congress. Whatever honor or dis grace may attach to nullification, we deire may be possessed by South Carolina alone. The most plausible objec tion which in brought against repealing per sonal Liberty laws is this, that their repeal might appear to be the result of alarm can sea bv the South to secede, and bv the nresent at- ! tempts to execute these threats. But we aught ! ing rncin, and causes us to tremble for the safe not to be deterred from undoing what ought ; ty of the Union, -per V and for the integrity of never to have been done, lest it should possibly the noble example every true patriot has prayed be supposed fiat our conduct springs from mo tives by which we are not actuated.

GREAT HEALING DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE. The indirect, unconstitutional, spirit and motive of the Nothern States in passing their anti-fugitive slave laws, it is well known to the South, was the subject of objection and remon strance on the part of every Northern Demo crat and Democratic press. The brunt of the battle for States' Rights fell on us at the North and we fought it loyally and persistantly up to defeat, and have continued to do so to the present day, when the Democrats of the North who are entitled to the name are found as true to their creed as the party has ever been. In the face of every discouragement proceeding from friends or enemies they have stood man- I nil v io uieir tuny, wiuinug hu jwui, hj South, no East, no 'West, but the Union anc the Constitutional nrivilcsres of tho con! lfcdirra- tion. as thev belonged to all sections. lacy were contented to do their whole dyy, ch ctr- fully and patriotically, the while ipfruenccs and circumstances operated to demoralize anu dis courage thera most fatally -rid they are ready to enduro everything now, rather than sacrifice that rectitude of principle which has borne them Loftily above all mortification arising from discouragements and defeats. This be ing the case, it seems to us a sort of indepen del.' t spectator of the field of national troubles tl.'at our friends of the South, who have taken uj.1 the cry of secession, and who scruple not to cast reflections on Northern men, because of the late late Republican tri umph, and the cot sequent culmination of the causes for secession,, are rather gratuitous in their manner of conferring blame. We think a revisal of their own conduct will conviuce thera that a very liberal share of it vests cn their own shoulders. When Whiggery, in 1S52, began to toy with Abolitionism, and offcr her marriage. Demo cracy, North and South, was never more firm ly united in principle and purpose. Bcthsec tions were as one in giving vitality to the Com promise Measures of 1850, as embodied in the Kansas and Nebraska Bill. Both were, as if with one voice, approvers of the Cincinnati Platform, which ratified the soundnet'55 of the territorial policy mentioned. The pres ent gov ernment in its sentiment and action, up' to a certain point, confirmed the justice and wis dom of that policy. That point was the in fraction of the Kansas and Nebraska act, whi -h the South unwisely favored; and from tha time until now its action has completely stulti fied, and finally defeated, Democrats both North and South. The South suggested the ; action of the government which produced the i Lecompton trouble. The South initiated the Senate resolutions in 185, which tied the De mocracy hand and foot to a Southern policy impracticable and impossible at the North, wherever consistent Democracy had enduring vitality. The South, coalescing with a gov ernment powerless to cany out the object of the coalition, solely Avith the purposeof putting down Stephen A. Douglas the only man who could have reconciled the claims to constitu tional justice, mad by the South, Avith the feel ing and influence of the North and secured to the South the full measure of State Rights, and of equality in the Territories. The South in doing so deviated from the recognized path of democracy ; the North was true to that an cient and umtying governing principle. This truth sums up the Democratic party history for the past six years. The South has made a great mistake; and it were better at once to acknowledge that she has done so, and thereby aggravated the mutual Democratic defeat of both sections, than to reflect on the North, wherein her own in fluence has proved our opposition, and most decided weakness. Had Deuglas been allowed to succeed the principle he advocates would, in practice, have finally settled all the heartburn ings which have arisen out of the Territorial question. We hardl)r believe there is a South ern man opcu to conviction who will, to-daj-, deny that the principal of Non-intervention with slavery in the Territories is the sole pros pective cure for the jealousies and agitations Avhich raise themselves up with such threaten ! li woiuu continue io ue io mose wno, nivc our ; fathers, might have the courage to place them ! selves beyond oppression's power. The South has not gone so far on her way to disintegrate i the Union that she may not, honorably and - i 1J1 x 1 . 1. . i . 11 1. safely, come back to the resumption of her con stitutional power, and the adoption of a princi ple that will ensure her justice and prosperity m the Union. We invite her with cordiality to come back to the united struggle aginst sec tionalism and fanaticism which cannot outlive our union as a Democratic party. If we have used the idea of blame with referrenee to the past, it is in the sense in which it may be ap plied to that patriotic pride, and jealousy of the integrity of their rights and privileges, which often leads men to temporarily forget their bet ter judgment and discretion. We, here at the Xorthr ere many months pass over, will be uni ted as one Democratic phalanx under the ban ner of Non-intervention; and,., for ourseh'es, we can ee no evil practically imminent, which can hinder the South from joining with us, and doing what necessity and the soundest discre tion compels us to do and what future pros- i pects encourage us to do, namely : "Bide our I Timk." ! . i An exalted Englishman, a short time since, j greAv rather boastful, in the reading room of the St. Nicholas Hotel, in referance to the i'Big j Ship.''

PRINCE IN KIClOIOND. A Briliih View Oar Vulgarity Brutal Crowds, ofcc The London Times' correspondent, who visited this city with the Prince of Wales, and received a variety of friendly attentions from members of the press and others, has written the following cheerful views of our city : ' Richmond, Virginia, Oct. 8.-The Prince has paid a flyinff visit of some forty hours to this leg islative capita ofl the Old Dominion as it is called, for Virginia was the first English colony in North America. Here the first salves were imported in 1620. and at this hour Virginia remains one of the most uncompromising supporters of pro-slavery in all the U. S. The Royal party left the White House on the morning of the 6th. The leave-taking be tween the Prince and the President and his neice, Miss Harriet Lane, was marked by the most warm expressions of regret on both sides that the visit had been of so short duration. The carriage of the Prince, followed by those of the chief mem bers of the Cabinet, left tho mansion at 10 o'clock. There was a large crowd collected in the avenue leading up to the house, who cheered the Prince most heartily as he drove off. At the Ar senal a sa'.nte of twenty-one guns w- s fiied as the cortege entered, and a similar compliment was paid from the Navy Yard when bis Royal High ness went on board the little steam cutter Har riet Lane. The instant the'Royal party were on board the haAvsers were cast off, and the quick little steamer sped down the broad quiet waters of the Potomac like a bird- Passing Monnt Ver non the speed was slackened, and the bell tolled an empty honor paid to the poor, ruinous, neglected house cf Washington by every steamer or vessel of any kind that passes up or down the stream. At 2 o'clock the boat reached the little Janding place at Acquia Creek, where the special train was :n waiting to convey the party to Richmond. The first part of the journey was over Avhat is termed a " strap road," one of the most unsafe varieties of railway ever used, even in this coun try of had tramways of all kinds. The scenery through which the route lay was not attractive. The land in Virginia has been exhausted by con stant reckless farming. Very little is grown here now bnt tobacco, and, the climate being unusual ly favorable to the cultivation of the black, slave breeding forms almost the whole business of the State. A. few plantations were, hcwevei, passed, and a few negro huts, the best worse than the worst Irish cabins. The train crossed the Rap pahannock river, and stopped for a few minutes at Fredricksburg. At this latter city Washing was born, and here his mother i" buried. But the house in which the Fathe.p ' of his Country first saw light has, of course been pulled down, and the nvvnumeut over the. grave of his mother, the first stone of which was laid by President Jackson in great state ..iiearly thirty years ago, has been left unfinshtyY sinco that time. Truly, the Americans, as a'' people, lack veneration or gratitude, perhaps both. The train retimed the fair grounds, some two miles distant irom Richmond, at 6 in the even ing. The, -Mayor and a committee of citizens were in waiting to welcome his Royal Highness to the.i--3pital of old Virginia. There was an im concmrsp of i eople who blocked up all fh'.'nvcnnps leading to the Ballard Hotel, so that I J-tie cariaf es could scarcely force a passage. The - . . " i r -11 cheering, or rainer nowimg, was vinainous There was to have been a ball in the evening, bnt that greatest of all difficulties financial dif ficultiesstood in the way of its being carried out nn a proper scale, so the idea was aban doned. Richmond is not a little altered from the time when Madame Esmand reared her young Vir ginians here. Seen from a distance it looks a very handsome town, both for grandeur and far lar ger than it really is. Its population is onlj' about 40,000, of which nearly one-half are blacks and slaves. The capitol is a bizarre Grseeo-Ameriean building, which runs much to windows, as is generally the case with all the pnblic buildings of this continent. In the hall of this building is the noble statue of Washington, the first erected to that great patriot, with a simple, dignified in scription, worthy of the hero it commemorates. The sculptor's legend in tho corner reads, "Fait, par Ilovdon, Citoyen Francois, 1783.,? Like all other slave State capitals, there are slave pens for the public auction of these misserable beings in this city. During all the night of the arrival, every room and stairway in the bal'ard Hotel was crammed with a low wretched mob, each striving and hus tling to get some look into tho apartments where his Royal Highness was staying. There were cat-calls, shouts and whoopings, with cries for him to show himself invitations with which, I n--ed scarcely say, his Rrn-al Highness did not comply, for the rough, howling, brutal nib that had swarmed round his carriage on arriving at tho hotel, had given him a pretty good insight into tha general tendencies of a. Richmond crowd. Next day (Sunday) he attended divine ser vice at St. Paul's Church, nearly tho whol? con gregation rising to gape and stare at him when he entered. After service, contrary to the prac tice which the whole party have rigidly adhered to of resting on Sunday, the Prince, with tlu Duke and a few membprs f his suite, walked out to see the Capital. While here a rough, dir ty crowd collected, who croAvded in upon the pal ty most unceremoniously, making all sorts of eo.ri."ei vulgar remarks upon the personal ap pearance of its members in :t loud conversational fone. aL'dible to every one. While the Prince stood locking at the statue of Washington, to which I iic've already alluded, some calied out. "Oui's.s he w'hipped you Britishers ;" " Oil, you like him don't vou? Sartain:" with other insulting observations ot i still coarser nature. The Prince took not the leas.' notice of this ruffianly ill-taste, but, after a while, went to the Senate Chamber, and then quitted tho building. In tli3 street, of course, they were ail followed by a still larger crowd, which at last g rew so great that to avoid it the whole party turnt d into the house of Gov ernor Letcher, where tt'ey 'emained for some time, escaping at last by a private door to their carriages, in which they'divve out to Hollywood Cemetery, returning to their hotel in the even m.

PEXATE. Mr. Powell offered a resolution that the Seces sion portion of the message be referred to a spe cial committee of thirteen, which was carried. The same committee were authorized to in quire into the necessity of further legislation to protect Federal property, also the expediency of amending the Constitution to ensure protection to the property of the States and Territories. Adjourned at 12:15 p. m. HUl'SR. Mr. Morris, of 111., gave notice that on Monday next he should call up the resolution, offered a few days ago, looking to the perpetuity of the Union, aud would ask a suspension of the rules for the purpose. Mr. Vallandingham from the Special Commit tee appointed last session, on the Senate bill abol ishing the franking privilege, made a report, pro posing several amendments, which were ordered to be printed.

' Mr. Hawkins, of Fla., asked to be excused from serving on the committee. He had been inform ed that unless he was formably excused or refus ed to serve that he would be reprimanded or cen sured by the House. But his main reason for making such a request was, that he did not believe in the appointment of a Committee for Union-saving purposes. He now believed, as heretofore, that the time for compromise had passed. The lion. John Cochrane, of New York, strong ly appealed to Mr. HaAvkins to withraw his re quest. Mr. C's. remarks were ardently patriotic, and elicited the applause of the galleries. The Hon. Muscoe Robert Hunter Garnett, of Virginia, promptly rebuked this demonstration from the galleries, when those occupying them iiissed. Mr. Garnett said those hissing were a disgraceful set of blackguards, and he hoped the Chair would maintain order. Quiet was restored. Mr. Cochrane also condemned alike the censure or applause of the galleries, and said; if the Amer ican Congress is to fall, let it fall with the robes of order decently wrapped around it. Mr. Hawkins said his actions were the result of twenty years reflection. Mr. Crawford, of Georgia, wanted to see wheth er the Honse would force Mr. Hawkins to serve ; and hoped that other Southern members would also ask to be excused. Without a vote on Mr. Hawkins' request, the House adjourned to Monday, the Southerners TP ting against the adjoBrnroentr. - There is no doubt that a large- portion ef tK southern members will ask te te escaped from ervipg on the cotcmitteei. , ORIGINAL POETRY.

Though sarcasm, irony and bitter invective are hurled on his defenceless head defenceless save by the kind interposi tion of friends in his behalf, aided by truth and justice, he must bear the brunt, the invidious slang and dictatorial criticism of many who, placed in his position, would fall perhaps far below the editor in the good work of aiding and instructing the public mind of guarding the interests of its readers of building up the re sources of his country, and lifting the voice of truth and mercy in the defence of innocence and for the suppression of immorality. The editorial chair is an exalted position. If the duties incumbent upon it are discharged intelligence must needs wait as a handmaiden on the beck of the editor not that sickly smat tering of a little which can make show of a great deal, but the intricate labyrinth of the public weal and all questions affecting it must be familiar as household words. Xo half handed knowledge will avail him who has to draw conclusions of the future from the past and advise of the public welfare. To do this he must read, he must think, he must reflect. He must apply every vestige of mental power unceasingly ; and this it is that dAvarfs the pleasure and cankers the joy of an editor's life. Hence pleasure and relaxation come with added charms to- tho editor whose Aveary head is aching and whose fevered brow is thirsting for recuperation and cessation from toil. The Editor of the Progress returns this eve ning at which time we (the Reporter) will most cheerfully resigu the chair editorial, having im- bibed long ago, from observation and slight ! ty lie.-:, back of all this in the perverted senti experience, the idea that its duties were not the ' meat of the North that wide-spread ignorance phere in which pleasure and the performance 3 i U 1 1 " XI 1 nt niitv rnnlrf lio mtorminiy on ilm nnlr cation perhaps in the wide world where they cannot.

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. -SECESSION IMMINENT. We presented yesterday afternoon all that portion of" the President's Message which had any real interest at the present time. The President does not believe in the right of Con gress or the General Government to coerce a State, and still less in the policy of attemnting to do so. As a man of plain common sense. he on of al Constitution, hoi ma' do something to avert the impending dan ger of dissolution, but fearing that an- action may be too late. We ready see nothing in the Message to excite even the most susceptible Southern Rights man. We may see something in the document at large, that we do not see in the language as telegraphed. AVe were therefore surprised to learn by private telegraph this morning from Washington City that even the most conservative Southerners there had aban doned all hope of the Union, and that they say the Message is the last drop that makes the cup overflow. We confess that we cannot understand this. AVe only see that, whatever may be the reason, the fact is as our correspondent states it.- Wil. Jour. THE 

MESSAGE. This important document was spread before our readers yesterda- morning and, of course, ! it was eagerly perused. The public mind throughout the country had never before on a similar occasion been in a more anxious state, and the desire was intense to see what the President had to say upon the most appalling crisis that ever threw its dark shadow over our land. "We cannot enter into an elaborate review of the message, nor is it necessary. It is a well written State paper, coming fully up to the standard of ability established by Mr. Buchan an's previous performances as a writer on gov ernment affairs. He gives a plain, temperate and forcible representation of the perilous con dition of the republic, accompanied with con servative comments and suggestions, showing a full sense on his part of the responsibilities of his position, and an earnest disposition to j do officially all in his power to avert or miti-, gate the threatened catastrophe. Upon the twin subjects of secession and coercion hlJ opinions we think are sound and just. lie dc nies the constitutional right of a State tc secede, on the one hand, and the constitutional power to coerce, on the other. This is Rutting both doctrines where they belong autside of t7te Constitution. . It is to be hoped that Cfiigress will be ena bled to devise in its wisdom some plan for pre venting the utter disruption of the Confedera cy. If South Carolina secedes alone, let her go in peace, and Sterwards be kindly dealt with by whatever of the Union may re main. If all tl'ie cotton States foilqw her, and they associas themselves under a new and inde pendent government, let them do so, since there is no het for it, and let relations of amity be preserved with them. If all the slave States se cede and erect themselves into a Southern Con federacy, it will be to their interest to cultivate peace witn ail tne world, and certainly as much to the interest of all the world to cultivate peace with them. Things will take their course, and all that can be done is to leave the stream of events to flow on, trusting that- a kind and merciful Providence will not wholly give up our government and people to destruc- i . i . . . , . , i tion,but that in some'way, and at some "not re- j mote day, they may be restored to unity, tran- il .1 il . it ' j 11 1 li:v, - lVitlLI, OV,VLIV'iHH UI l.i Vt 1 lllC U(A V . sees that the thing is impracticable and could , , . . . i .i 1 , i ir c i- .

We still hope, amidst the most fearful discouragments that this republic will not be blotted out from the family record of nations. The President's representation of our foreign relations are, on the whole, satisfactory, and requires no special comment at our hands. We have merely glanced hurriedly over that por tion of the message. If, upon a more careful perusal, we find anything worthy of exception able notice, we will give it our attention.-Pcf . Erpress. TnE President's Message. We ask all our readers, in perusing the President's Mes sage, to remember that this is the last annual message that Mr. Buchanan will ever address to the people of the United States perhaps it is the last one that will ever be delivered to these United States. Let it also be remembered that Mr. Buchanan is a man venerable in age, of great experience in public affairs and that he can have no other motive than the honorable one of doing his duty and living in the grateful memory of his countrymen. It should also be remembered that Mr. Buchanan entered public life forty years ago that he was the asociate of McDufne, Andrew Stevenson, Joel R, Poin sett, and that noblest Roman of thera all, Xa- ii ? i ir 1- l l r. ... h mnio i 'on u njis noon am ar mt i ,. - :r . , the workings of our government ever since the administration of Mr. Monroe, and that he can have no object but te see the Union perpetua- ted, with the just rights of every citizen prop- crly respected and guarded. hatcver objec- tion any may urge against his message, Ave in- sist, injustice to hint, to the exalted station he occupies, and to the respect to which age and experience are entitled, that these considera tions shall have their due weight. All the President's reasonings on the slavery question the frightful aspect of the country, brought about by the ignorance, fanaticism and moral treason of the anti-slaveryists are, in the main, eorrect, and his general recommen dations in regard to a settlement are perhaps proper enough. But how shall they be ac complished, or how can members of Congress, or even the delegates to a national convention called for this purpose, act upon the President's suggestions and solve the existing difficulties ? He says "Liberty Bills'' or otherwise obstruc tions to the "Fugitive Slave Bill" must be re pealed, and a construction given or an additiod made to the Constitution that shall secure the same protection to " slave property" that is given to any other kind of property in the fed eral Territories. Precisely so the South must have this, or the Government will be, as it should be, broken up, for it is necessary to i'ts prosperity, and indeed its ultimate, if not present safety. But the Constitution alreadr does this. Even the most benighted among them the "anti slaveryites"' admit tie former of these things, while the Supreme Court, by an almost unani mous decision, have decided the legality and i iustico of tho latter.

The President's Message, is attacked by the Press on all sides for its want of independence, and deccision on the agitating questions of the day. In fact, with the exception of the intim ation that it will be his duty to enforce the collection of the revenue in a seceding State, he leaves the whole subject of providing for the exigencies of the time to Congress which appears to be in no frame of mind to meet them j calmly.
