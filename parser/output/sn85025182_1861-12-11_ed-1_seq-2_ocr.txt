Most persons after reading the President's Message will lay it down with a feeling" of disappointment not so much on account of what he says, as what be omits to eay Upon the questions of the day Mr. Lincoln maintains a studied silence. He does not hike a firm and decided position each a position as might have been expected from a firm and decided man. The same ambi guity and indirectness, the same befog&ed and muddy style characteristic of the Inau gural and of the message of the 4ili of July last, are preserved in this document, which we had a right to expect would be so ex plicit as to be incapable of misconstruction. The country is agitated by a great and vital question. On the one hand the mas of the people desire that the war for the preservation of the Union should be con dueled upon the principles of the constitu tion as laid down at the last session of Con gress in the resolution passed with singular unanimity by that body. We have a Con stitution to main'ain as well as a Union to preserve. In the shock of arms, it is emi nently desirable that the great charter of our liberties should suffer no injury. Sound pol icy, as well as right demands that we should be faithful ourselves to the Constitution and the laws while endeavoring to compel the rebellious to return to their allegiance On the other hand there is a taction of Abo litionists who desire that the war should be perverted from its legitimate purposes into a crusade against the institutions of the Southern States and that the Constitution and laws should, be trampled under foot Henry C. Hickok, formerly Superinten- J dent of Schools for Pennsylvania, -propose to raise for the war a regiment of Pennsyl vania school teachers. Death or Volunteer. Wm. T.

ARMY COBRESPOJIDEXCE. Hancock, Md., Dec. 3d, 1861. A look at the Heavens on a clear night assures me that the North Star still retains its position, but the non-arrival of the "Star ol the North" causes me to wonder if it still retains its position in the literary galaxy This letter, therefore, is sent on a voyage of discovtry. - Doubtless you are surprised at our being here. Many more were the morning after our arrival. But let me explain: On Tues day of last week a number of the men were anxious to have a street drill in William sport, Maryland, which is near our Camp. While makinz preparations for it, Act. Brig. Gen Leonard sent for rne and informed me that ihere had been some fighting in this vicinity, and that he wiehed me to lake a detachment of artillery to this place. With out saying a word to the boys as to our des tination, we started on our "street drill" which extended some twenty -seven miles ! We only stopped once to give the horses a bite of teed This place was reached at midnight. About two thirds of the inhabi tants are Secessionists, hence they were as much surprised as their friends across the river to see a couple of curious carriages closely screened by tarpaulins. Ihe lebels on the bluiis opposite were evidently curi ous, nay, anxious to see the strange bird, and lined the hills in all directions in their eaaerness. " Hope deferred maketh the heart sick," and eo 1 concluded to exhibit the strange animal. Lest the sight ot its beautiful plumage should dazzle their eyes and cause sudden dismay, it was marked ; and well fed with a strange combination of gun-powder, iron, and bullets, li speaks, and proves itself that curious animal a Parrott. But watch the effect : Over one mite flies that iron and lead, and a bright light and sudden explosion among a group of men show that it was well aimed. Men are seen to fall, horses are Been to fail Men are seen to run horses are teen to receive the plaudits of the assembled throng as to the merits of our proficiency in drill with becoming dignity. 1 hear Irom reliable sonrces that the Lorn missioners of our county have relused to act upon the relief matter prayed for by the families of our uallant soldiers !

Coburn, Esq , County Saperintendant of Bradford county, who was in attendance, as a delegate from that county in the recent State Educational Convention, . met with a serious loss at the depot in our city, at noon to-day, through the operations of one of the adrot pickpockets who are ever on the alert in that locality to pounce upon uisu?pect ing strangers It appears that Mr. Coburn, had an hour or so previous to the robbery drew his salary from the State .as County Superintendatit, which consisted as far as he can recolleet ol five S20 bills, one linn dred and twenty dollars in S10 bills, about thiity dollars in 55 bills, and; three dollars in gold dollar pieces. This was placed in his wallet, and he proceeded, to the depot where he purcha-ed a ticket !r Washing ton city, and was in the act of getting in the train ol cars for that place when he dis covered that his pocket book was missing. Aiov nave the alarm, but, of lie niiiVMi'v.j r . 1 course, in such a promiscuous crowd, me discovery was utterly impossible. Mr. co burn remained in the city, and made known his loss to the Mayor, who has taken active measures for detecting the theif. Mr. Co burn is a poor man, and the loss to him is a very serious one."

ISC I Friend Wilt ; We are still holding forth 1 at thi place, and it is getting rather uncom fortably cold o'nights for our tents, and it it were not for our Moves 1 am sure that we would suffered from the rigorous cold of the last few days. If the government intended us to winter here they would erect barracks j lor us as they have already done for some j ol the troop quartered here. But we are under marching orders again, and our noble Colonel assures us that we shall con be in a warmer clime and closer proximity to the enemy. We do not know how soon we shall leave here but think about the llth or 12th of this month. The nin tonic of the day i in re gard to the compromise question between Ihe belligerent pariies The only compro mise that the North can offer with becoming dignity to hen-ell, her intitn:iors, the Con stitution and the Law, is the surrendering ot the arch traitors who have caused this re bellion to justice, laying down their arms and swearmg allegiance to the government they are endeavoring to overthrow, thereby securing that peace; "Which like deep water runs Our shores from the horrors of war." The health of tne Camp has not been so good for the last few days, as from one to two deaths have occurred each day this week. Vet when we consider that here we have from 

SEVEN to EIGHT THOUSAND MEN thrown promiscuously together the mortality is certainly not great. A strange report spread itself (or who could haye told it) through the camp the other day to the effect that the small-pox had mide its ap pearance in camD. The surgeons made a most thorough examination ot all the Hos pitals and quariers of the troops, without being able to find a single case ot the dread ed scourge. The prevailing disease being Typhoid fever, which is very prevalent in the old part of the camp: vet our Regiment at present has not a single case of fever re ported.
