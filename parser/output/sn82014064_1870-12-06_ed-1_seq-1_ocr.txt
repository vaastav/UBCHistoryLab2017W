ARBMBUNO OFCONGRBW. Washington, Dec. a.—Tbe third, and laa, sea •eioncf tbe Forty-first Congress opened to-day. Tbe day was a magnificent on*, tbe air being aa •warm and balmy as a day In June. At an early boor the avenue was thronged with people wending their way to tbe Cap’t'i, and long before either home was called to order ever? available seat In the gd- | levies was occupied. The large number of colored people present, e-peclally in tbe lower House, where tbe first Beoresentailve of their race was to be sworn into office, was a ma’ked fea ture of tbe occasion; bat In this tbe colored people were disappointed, as the soccer tor of Wbntemoredid not make bis appearance doting tbe day. Tbe diplomatic gal lery was well filled, tbe mo*t prominent In that quarter and occupying front seats being Ministers ■ Thornton. Trelibsrd, Gerolt, and their !adl*». The roll call in tbe House showed 173 members present, wbile In the Senate l»u*. few members ■were absent. ■me menDEST'a message. The reading of the President's message ocei pled abon”. an hour, aid was listened to with nark’d attention. The effect was better In toe Iloose than In the Senate. In toe lat ter body the general dlssatisfaction was vfry evident. The only part of toe -message which an neared to pat e verybody In good humor, was that concluding portion relating to |Tc-errlrg the parity of elections, that every man entitled to vote can vote Just once at each elec- Urn, At th a * lesion there wav a broad amtle on t\ e ft-ce of • very member. The passage rclcrriog to irv* one ref rni was n«it well received, and was uotco'ifl-ieredlttoeb-wof taste, so fwat pro tection la concerted. The protectionists are in Te-y good Fplrlts over the President’s statement of their pca'tton The eagerness to catch all that was advanced with regard* to the Alabama claims was vc’j great. When that port’on rf the it oaige was reached, the members . looked earnestly toward the Clerk, while toe rep resentatives In'lhe diplomatic gallery leaned for ward with tbe*r hand? to toelr ea»s as If anxious not u> lose a wort. The portion relating to toe fltoi rv question took everybody by surprise, and It wan the general remark that the amhorsnip thereof was too mnch ol toe Bntler style not to be easily recognizable. The general comment to n'ght rn toe m< ssase Is that It is more of an elec - tlooeering document than a s’ale paper, and where - it docs not make a plausible statement. It succeeds in evading tne i«»ues most Ingeniously. Tne mass of th* gmtcnng gcnerall l*a contained in toe document. It la said, will make It a strong paper with the peop’e, sod, if It la not any more logical than a stamp speech, it will prove equally as convincing. The document isger orally summed up as adroit In Its statements, skilful in Its arrangement, and forcible, if not Iglca'.ln Its arguments. The only poruon of the message which has given genera! surprlie is that le'atlng to the fishery question. It la thought he e that a very strong cave Indeed is made out against the provinces. THE

Tbe MT*tcrlon* Dl*ca»c at El tin— The Com of ibe Late Jin* Daniel* further inTcatlgated lmportant Fact* Elicited* Speclel Despatch to the Chicago Tribone. Elgin, Dec. 3.—This community Is stUl tallied over the cause of Mrs. Daniels’ death. Since me ftrirhtfUF excitement in this neighborhood, about a rear ago, the public mind U -peculiarly suscepti ble on the subject erf parasite*. Dr. Clark haring determined to InvesMgate the matter, as well as the means at bis command al lowed, called a meeting of physician*, yesterday, at the bouse of Mr. Newcomb, an amateur micro acoptat. Dr. Terrell and Dr. Whitfrld were pres ent with Dr. Clark. Two Instruments were used, one owned by Mr. Newcomb, and tbe other by Dr. Tyrrell. They were both good, and of high Sower, though neither of them was, perhaps, rst-clas*. . | The examination was begun at 10 o clock. The light was not favorable, the day being dart and ck>udy. Minute panicle* of the muscle were placed under the glass wj»h a power of *W dlam- ! eten: but no living aolmalcnl* could be detected. : It was noticed, however, that the muscular fibre 1 which, in the healthy state. Is smooth and of a light color, was covered with dark spots on the tides, presenting a granular appearance. Jnst the tame as the sut face of pork alter tncAbur have passed through. These spots were supposed to be parasites, and Jf so, they were there in innu merable hordes. They were not surrounded by the cysts to which the insects found in the fluid taken from the breast were enclosed. Several other spedmeos were examined, bat nothing more was discovered until the power of the gits* was raised to css diameters, which magnifies the object superficially S99.ee times. This brought ontwhat the doctors decided weie the cysts and theratasites inside. The cyst* looked lisebaes of pulpy mauer, with a dark spot, supposed to be the parasite, U the centre. . , It wu some satisfaction to find them, hut so far none of them exhibited any motion or other evidence of life. Water was uied to rouse them from their dormant condition, and wltn gratify ing results. several were seen running about on the object glass. Dr. Tyrrell having observed one of them pass rapidly backward, and forward, and Dr. Ctark another, which moved much more slowiy and lor a shorter distance. Mr. Newcomb, who is a microsoopltt of considerable experience, gave bis opinion that there were objects moving here and there on the glass. but, not being a phy sician. he would not venture to say they were K rasttes. The physicians were posinve that they j discovered them scam, and said they were stmfarto those found in the fluid and m the blood, fhereisno doubt that something with power to move was on the glass, for even the un educated eye could see the xnonoo. Several specimens were examined with the same result. Tneir shape has already been described, and those found yesterday were of the same form, though of larger size, man the specimens seen last week. But even me largest of Ucm are very mirnte. One of toe Dactors said mat one hon ored of them could move round a blood vessel without touching the sides. Tneir dimensions according to the micrometer varied from the 7 ixo'b to the l?,N»th of an inchtn diameter, and • trifle longer one wav than the other, Thev were cslkd “ mud turtles” by one of the Doctors on account of their shape. _ The result of the invesagatlon was a conviction, amcunitnc almost to a certainty, on me part of the xncdical gentlemen, that the parasites were tn the muscits as well as in me blood and fluids of me body. and mat her death was more or less at ujbnwble to their presence. They regarded the stmnioms shown by the patient as of a strange IL( j uouftisi character in trohold cases, gh® had a violent fever, excruciating pains over nerbodv. and extreme soreness tn her muscles. <nje was insensible for twenty-four hours before her death, and for two or three days previous was perfectly helpless and could not move hand or loot when net arm was raised, it was as It cead, and remained wherever it was laid, the pa tient appearing to have no power over the mus cles.

The Eleventh Anniversary of the Ex* tcuiioa of (Mnwotomte Brown* i-Vom the .Vne York Hun, Dec. 3. Eleven yetis tgo yesterday John Brown was extcutoa m Cbarlesiuwn, Vs., for the enms of It tiling an armed force againat the Stale of VirgtLia for the purpose of liberating the slat ea. Every recurring anniversary of bin death b&a been solemnly observed by the col ored people of this city, and last night, in an swer to an extensively circulated invitation, a large number aestmtded at Shiloh Presbyte rian Church, corner of Prince and Marion street**, to assist in commemorating the sacri fice of the dead patriot. After eioging a prayer, the Her. Q. High land Garnet, paetorof tbe church, delivered an addrese pertinent to the occasion. He said , there were peculiar reasons why the memory ! of John Brown should be honored by the coo* : grcgation of Shiloh Church. Just previous i to bis departure for the Booth, be attended! divine service here, and occupied the pew m ftont of the pulpit, which is now set aside for i the elders. Aims request, on that accasion, I hit favorite hymn, “Blow ye tbo Trumpet, Blow,” was sung to the tune of Lenox. The l speaker said: 1 knew him twenty years before be undertook the great crowning deed of his life. 1 knew all his plane, and was in bis con fidence rcspcctiig the Virginia movement. On bis l*st appearance in th:a city, bo told me that be was on bis way to the South, where he would soon strike a blow which should be felt long aMcr be had passed away. I said to him: ; *• My friend, the time has hardly come for so grand and eo dangerous an attempt. Yon wilt be left alone in the hour of trial. Your men will desert yon when yon most need their aid. and you yourself will fall a sacrifice.” •• That may all bo. eaid the brave old man, i •< tut my purpose is fixed. I apprehend that j God has chosen me to do this work, and even 1 if 1 do ro more than call the attention of the | world to the great object of my life, my par- ] rose shall have been accomplished. I feel God's hand upon me, and must go whero I | am sent.” He was a strict Calvinist, and had 1 an abiding faith in the obligation to fulfil his misfion. He begged me to advise the colored 1 people to buy cotton cloth and other necessa ry materials,’••for" eaid he, “I shall ajoaraiso the pricesof all tbeaethinga.” What has resulted from the great work of the self-devoted philanthropist t A nation has naen in a dav. One stroke of the non has made four millions free. Enlightened senti ment lias given to the once degraded race the rights of citizenship. One of tbe-o days the story will read like a romance. John Brown’s first object was to ronao the colored men to | aclinn in behalf of th*ir freedom. When he was a wool merchant in Spring field, Hass., ho Invited me there to confer i with him, and it was during this visit that he‘ 1 made preparations for the reprinting of ••Walker’s Appeal.” a work that was after-i ward widelv circulated. On the 2d of Decern-1 her. 1559, the day appointed for the execution of John Brown, a larce meeting was held in | this church. We assembled here, hundreds | of ns, at 10 o’clock, and prayed and exhorted ; till 2. We were in great danger, for, in the | then existing state of public opinion, we did not know how soon wo might be attacked. We knew, too. that on the publication of our j proceedings (there were nine reporters pres ent) any of na might have been arrested i for treason. Among tbo speakers of! the day was the venerable Henry Johnson, of Ithaca. Tbo effect of the old ; min’s thrilling eloquence was wonderful. The women sobbed aloud; strongmen cried like children, and some of tbo reporters buried their faces in their bards and wept. The evening papers contained a despatch an nouncing the death of the brave old man, and. account for it as von may, tbe moment «ben tbo words of Father Johnson eeemed to have gone to the very quick of the hearts of his bearers was that in which tbe son! of the martyr went home to God. At the conclusion of Mr. Garnet’s address, nhicb was frequently applauded. Mr. Titus read John Brown’s speech, delivered after sentence had been pronounced upon him. This was followed by an address from Mr. Crosby, a young orator of much ability. Mr. A. M. Powell, editor of the Xatvmal Standard, was then introduced. He Institu ted a comparison between Clay and Webster. the slavea of compromise,” and John Brown, tViA unswerving advocate of right and Justice, much to the belHlement of the great states men; and launched shafts of keenest satire at the anther of tbe fhrase “irrepressible conflict,” who In his last Senatorial speech, in .which he made an ineffectual bid for tbe Presi dential nomination, declared that John Brown bad been “juetivhnng.” Tbo speaker also reproved Salmon P Chase for his loss of prin ciple, and placed the Chief Justice in a bad light when contrasted with John Brown the martyr. Several other speakers addressed the meet ing, which continued in session till atter It q o'Sock. id \Ta« It an Elopement or a Be> trmrnl 1 From fir Sterling (IK.) GasrtU , Dec. S. _ On Saturday night a week or two ago. mine host of the Wallace House was accosted by a yonrg gentleman and lady, (we pat .the gentleman first in this instance, although it is against the spirit of the age), desiring the accommodations utuilly accorded to travellers. The hotel register was Disced before the gentleman, and, in a good round hand ho inscribed “ Frank Cornish and lady, Dixon.” A room was then allotted to them, to which they daly retired. So far all well. Bat aboat 3 o clock on Sun day morning, and after ihe hotel had been closed, ae it always is after the last train on Saturday night comes in. loud and repeated knocking* were heard at the door, which were finallv -responded to. The parties making the noise were an old lady and a grown-up lad. who desired to see the’lady from Dixon, Cpon being shown np to tbe room, the occupants were aroused, and the lady came to the door, further in gress beirg refused to the callers. A long talk ensued between theold and the young lady, when the old one and tbe lad went away, but for some reaeon the result was not satisfactory, and the old lady came back again. Alter some parlevine she was ad mitted, and once more called at tne room, where a second confab was bad at the door. The gentleman this time evidently did not like to be disturbed, and. to put an end to aU further proceedings of like nature, then ana there promised the young lady, in the pres ence of tbe elder one, who said she was tne mother of the younger, that, if she would send her away, be would marry her as soon as possible. Theold lady, upon hearing the premise, gracefully retiied- from tbat time until Monday morning, everything passed along very screnelv, the lady staying m her room, excfrt at ’meal times. On Sunday night the gentleman paid tbe t>Dl for the two up to Monday morning, and desired to be called in' the morning so that the twain would take the cars on the Bock is land road. He cot np in the morning in time for the train, and that was tbe last seen of him. At breakfast the lady, came down, when Mr. Helfield said to her. * thought you and vonr husband had taken the train early this’ morning,” at which she seemed greatly astonished, curst into tears, left tbe table, and went to bar room, from which she soon appeared, and pissed from the hotel into the street, still crying very ■ bitterly. Upon being questioned aha aald her husband bid gone out early in the morning ' with the intention of buying a carpet bag *9 , pnt thmp im and tint bo did nos say j anything to bet about going away. She said | krowwfacretogo. Herewasadilamma. Alona at-din a atrairo place—hotmoiber tt oeems bad left the city after the lasi interview—it ta no wonder ahe was f. nod sobbing piteously in the streets, finally, after wandering around for a good part of tbe day, the was taken in band %j eomo benevolent and kind-hearted cartiee, and placed on board tba cars for Dixon, her fare being paid. Sbe U represent ed ,as being quite an artleea young girl, andof rather prepossessing appearance. The man stated, daring a coureraa*iou on Sunday, that he bad found her in Chicago, and bad taken her away from her husband, thinking ahe bad plenty of money, bat the •tory was not credited. Anellier Plexican Grant in Cmll fornla-Flte Leainei of Tin JDioe* claimed. Tbe following common icitioa appears in I the Cincinnati Commercial, of November 29: | .‘• While the newspapers are discussing tbe questions of the llcGarrahan claim, ana the probable reasons for Grant taking so mocb interest therein. It may not be improper to call the attention of the public to another fraud, that ia nearly, if not of quit© equal magnitude, to tbe great McQarrabaii swindle. I refer to the afempt to float a Mexican grant on the Temeecbal tin miners in San Bernar dino County, CaL “ i succinct history of this cate may not be uninteresting to jcnr many reader*. About 1853 or l&M, Leonardo Serrano, a natire Califor nian, put in a claim, before the Board of Land Commiationcnt, which were in aeeaionat that time In California, for a Mexican grant of five letgnes of land to cover what was known as tbe Rancho do TtmeecbaL Alter due investi gation hie claim was rejected, and ao tho mat ter rested nr til 1359, when tin was discovered, in rather a romantic way, within three mllei of t*** Serrano house; but in the interim Ser rano bad died. Upon thodircovory of tin, Mr. Abel Stearns, of Los Angeles, bought the widew Serrano's claim. Stearns, by the way, was tbe first man that ever *ent ary California gold to tbe United States Mint, ho having sent gold taken from tbe dig gin ge near the Mission San Fernando, twenty five mfles from Lea Angeles, more than ten years before Marshall discovered gold in Sut ter's mill-race. Stearns took an appeal in the United States District Court from the Land Commissioner's decision, and after considera ble dtlav obtained a decree for five leagues of lands. ’The locators of tbe mining claim then appealed to the Supreme Court at Washington, where, in 1367, tbe finding of tbe court below was reversed, and the claim and mines were declarodpublie land. Dunne the pendency of tbe retail in Washington, Pioch A Co.,' of San Francisco, tried unsuccessfully to purchase some ol tbe lodes in tbe tin districts from tbe original locator*. After tbe decision of toe Supreme Court, Fiocb bought tbe San Jacicto Rancbe. a grant that was cotnfirmed by tbe Laud Com m&iionrrs about sixteen years ago, and sit uated twenty-six miles from Tames.htl. Bloch is now before tbe Laud Commissioner at Washington, trying, with considerable show of success, to float this grant on the tin mines. Here are tin mines that were discovered eleven years ago, from which oro has been ttkt-n which would yield over CO per cent of tin—tbe only lusility in the United States where tin taa been found in paying quantities; and yot they ara unde veloped. The only thing that has been done witfa then was to make a tin box. which was presented to ox-Secrelary Reward, and which was itemized by every paper in tbe United States as something very remarkable. Yes, all of these years tbcee mines have been dormant; the diecovtraisof tbe mines have not been permitted to work them, and the grant claimants would not work them fur fear of attracting public attention to their true value before they bad tho title arranged to suit themselves. If these mines were equally developed they would, doubtless, bo as valua ble as tbe New Idiia Quicksilver Mines.yet the country is losing revenue winch would be de rived from the working of tbe same, all be cause a few men desire, by fraud, to tako that which justly belongs to the people."
