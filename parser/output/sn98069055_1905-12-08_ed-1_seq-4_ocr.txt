Subscription Price—One Year, $1.00 ABERDEEN, S. D., DEC. 8,1905 Unwise Policy The unwisdom of the course being pursued by the city council in regard to the entrance into the city of the Groton-Ferney tele phone line can be best realized by coming in'contact with the people of the county outside""of!Aber deen. There"are three men on the council, two engaged in the jobbing trade and one a large re tailer, whose unselfishness in the •matter is more remarkable than commendable. The course which they permit the council to take in the matter is not only dis creditable to the city, but injuri ous not only to their own busi ness but to every business enter prise in Aberdeen. These business men have been active in contributing to the suc cess of social enterprises in tended for the purpose of ^win ning for Aberdeen the good will of business men in the little towns tributary to this distribut ing point, but now all the kindly feeling, the profitable friendship, thus won is thrown to the wind, and they go on obstinately pur suing a course that must in tensify the feeling of resentment toward Aberdeen that is growing all over the eastern portion of the county. The situation may seem justifyable to residents of the city, but outside, one fact keeps staring the people in the face—Aberdeen refuses, to let a farmer's telephoae line enter the city.' When the matter first came up it was quite generally talked about town that the council should straightway pass-an ordi nance permitting any farmer's line or independent company to to enter the city under such reg ulations as the council might from time to time impose. But each time the matter comes be a: fore the aldermen, their unwise action, or omission to do tjie o.v.5 sensible thing, causes the cry to go forth once more that Aber iv deen doen't want any farmer's ::3 line to enter the town. Of course this permission to such lines to enter the city, establish a toll station, conduct business and make such connec :i tions as are desirable, will be finally granted after the situation has become critical, but the tardy act of justice will come shorn of the grace that would Our Christmas Goods Are Vc Now on Display

William Allen White thinks that Governor Folk of Missouri has good presidential timber in him but that it should be matured by about a half dozen years in congress. He forgets that Folk is the exception to the rule. Consider the myriads of mature district attorneys that have en tered upon the duties of their office, sworn to enforce the law, without ever coming" with hailing" distance of their full duty, while this immature Joe Folk has never let a guilty rascal escape, except where rescued from his merci less enforcement of the law by the superior courts. If as an immature president he'solfar ex ceeds'the'mature ones, perhaps we had better not wait too Hong before trying him. The political cataclysm that impends over the whole vast em pire of Russia seems to be the in evitable fruit of centuries of mis rule. The saddest thing about it is that crimes of misgovern ment to be atoned for are to be wiped out by the blood of the hapless victims rather than that of the guilty ones. One thing appears certain that, at however bitter cost it goes, the old autoc racy must pass away. The stupendous price in blood, dis aster and humiliation the old Russia has paid for the new order should entitle the Russian people to an infinitely happier era.- Some opponents of a primary law in this state are getting mnch comfort out of the fact that the governor of Wisconsin has called an extra session to have, among other things, certain sec tions of the new primary law amended. They affect much self-cjmplacency over the fact that they were too wise to ap prove of such a law for this state, as it might sometime have to be amended. The appointment by President Roosevelt of his friend, Seth Bul lock, well known Black Hills character, to be United States marshall to succeedEd Kennedy, is accepted by the machine gang of the state with very wry faces. It is the best federal position in South Dakota, and this appoint ment made in disregard of ma chine wishes is considered rather ominous. Considerable important news of a local nature was this week unavoidably crowded out because of the many new advertisements of enterprising business men of the city handed in. SV 8"»S **». u' iJtr 0.

ABERDEEN, SOUTH DAKOTA Uhebtmek The president's message, one of the longest ever written, con taining over 2S,000 words, taking over two and a half hours to read it, is this week the subject ot much comment, mostly of com mendatory nature. Those de siring drastic railway legistation are somewhat disappointed, is even said the pro-railway ele ment in congress is pleased with it. But after all it is not so much what the president saj^ as what he does that will decide how resolute a leader of the plain people he is. Time will decide this.
