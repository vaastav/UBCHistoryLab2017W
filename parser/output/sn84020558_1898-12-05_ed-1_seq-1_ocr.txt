He remained only a short time in Durango, when he bought a return ticket to Chihuahua. Two prominent business men of this city came up from Durango on the same train with him and stated that ha bought a first-class ticket and rode in the second-class ccach as far as Torreon, where he took a Pullman.

With this purpose in view, appropriation bills are to be given the road at both ends of the capitol and pressed through with all possible hasto. 1 Two sub-committees of appropriation of the house havo been at work for a week. The deficiency bill to meet the extraordinary expenses of the army; and navy during the six months from January 1, 189a, to July l, is ready io ! be submitted to the full committee tomorrow, and the regular District of Columbia appropriation bill will be ready by the end of tho week.v;2It is necessary that tne former should becoms a law before the holiday recess, which :this year is to be shorter than usual, and Chairman Cannon hopes to see it through the house and into the senate before the end of this week. The democrats of the house have not disclosed their position, but it Is not believed they will seek to obstruct any appropriation bill necessary, for the maintenance of the army now in the field. Great interest is manifested in the president's message, which will be submitted to congress tomorrow on account of the many questions which it will have to deal with, and no presidential message in years has been listened to with the eagerness and the interest with which the reading of President McKInley's message will be heard tomorrow. , Senators express a determination to .take up the work of the session vig orously in the beginning with the hope of getting well advanced before the holidays, and they are countiitg upon taking up the appropriation bills at a very early date for the purpose of preventing an extra session due to any fail ure on the part of ithe national budget. ' It is expected that the army deficiciency bill will reach the senate dur ing the present week, the understanding at the north end of the capitol being tha: the house will dispose of it within'a ver-y. f ew days after assembling. The committee on appropriations will bring it in early for the double pur pose of having it passed quickly and of testing the feelings of senators on the questions connected with the war. The first days of the ssssion will be given up almost entirely to the messags and there is great ' interest mani fested in hearing the minutes and details of the president's recommendations.
