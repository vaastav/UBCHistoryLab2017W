GRAND JURY IS EMPANALLED A grand jury was drawn at Boise Saturday in the United States Dis trict court upon the order of Judge Dietrich to report for duty Decem ber 14. The order was entered upon the request of Districe Attorney Lingenfelter, who stated there was business pending which required the services of a jury. The only unusual circumstances surrounding the action of the court is the fact that court has been in session several weeks and that the drawing usually takes place at the opening of the term. Judge Dietrick stated yesterday af ternoon the jury had not been empan eled at that time, owing to the fact that ha to rancisco at any time but since learned he would bs required to go until some time in January.

Taft sent his first annual message on the state of the Union to congress Tuesday. The two houses of congress convened in regular session Monday. This is the first regular session of the sixty-first congress. The President's message treats of the following matters : "The relations of the United States with all foreign governments have continued the nominal basis of amity and good understanding, and very generally satisfactory," says the pres ident. He calls attention to the sat isfactory results of the arbitration treaty entered Jnto between the gov ernments of Great Britain and the United States, whereby the north At lantic fisheries questions are being settled by arbitration. The questions have been a cause of difference be tween the two countries for 70 years, but the final settlement of the rights ,of the U. S. is now at hand; is also the.settlement of the boundary line between this country and Canada. It is recommended that the United States participate in the Brussels' world's fair to be held in 1910. Turkey is eongiatulatsd upon her transition from a government of retregrade tendencies to a constitu tional government with a parliament and with progressive policies of re form. The conditions In Latin America are very satisfactory in every respect. Peru and Boliva have agreed to arbi trate their boundary differences. At tention is called to the fourth Pan American conference to be held at Buenos Ayres, Argetina, July 9th next. The importance of this is called to mind, from its political, social and trade standpoints. The American policy known is as the Munroe doc trine is re-affirmed. Mexico is in a highly prosperous condition and the relationship of our sister republic and the United States are amiable. The relations of the United States with Cuba, Domingo and the republic of Panama are satisfactory. The President justifies the action of the government in its handling of Nic aragua. The President calls attention to the disturbances caused by the Zelayan government. In the far east the policy of the United States is to maintain the open door in China. Our traditional rela tions with Japan continue cordial. The reorganization of the Depart ment of State is recommended. The Department should be modernized. The President says : "I earnestly recommend to the fa vorable action of the congress the es timates submitted by the department of the state and most especially the legislation suggested by the secretary of state's letter, whereby it will be possible to develops and make perma nent the re-organization of the depart ment upon modern lines in a manner to make a thoroughly efficient instru ment in the furtherance of oiir for eign trade and American interests abroad. The plan to have divisions of Latin-American and far eastern affairs and to institute a certain spec ialization in business with Europe and the near east will at once com mend itself. These politico-geograph ical divisions and the detail from the diplomatic or consular service to the department, of a number of men, who bring to the study of complicat ed problems in different parts of the world practical knowledge recently gained on the spot clearly is of the greatest advantage to the secretary of state in foreseing conditions likely to arise in conducting the great vari ety of correspondence and negotia tion." Economy in public expenditures is strongly recommended in all depart ments ol government fcsr thiSTrea notion curtailment of naval appropria tions is recommended. The custom frauds, the tariff, laws, delays are discussed in con formity with the President's former expressions from the platform. A ship subsidy bill is recommended; and separate state-hood for Mexico and Arizona. Additional legislation far the suppression of the "white slave" traffic is recommended; and also the creation of a national bu reau of health. In conclusion the President says: "Speaking generally, the country is in a high state of prosperity. There is every reason to believe that we are now on the eve of a substan tial business expansion, and we have just garnered a harvest unexampled in the market value of our agricul tural products. The high prices, which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming community, but on the other hand they mean very «considerable increas ed burdens upon those classes in the community whose yearly 'compensa tion does not expand with the im provement in business and the gen eral prosperity. Various reasons are given for the high prices. The pro portionate increase in the output of gold, which today is the chief med ium of exchange and is in some re spects a measurs of value, furnishes a substantial explanation of at least part of the increase in prices. Thé increase in population and the more expensive mode of living of the peo ple which, have not been accompanied by a proportionate increase in acre age production, may furnish a future reason. It is well to note that the in' srease in the cost of living is not con fined to this country, but prevails the world over, and those who would charge increases in prices to the ex isting protective tariff must meet the fact that the rise in prices has taken place almost wholly in those products of the factory and farm in respect to which there has been either no in' creass in the tariff or in many in stances a very considerable reduc tion."
