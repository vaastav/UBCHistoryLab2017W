Wk call tho attention of our readers to the prospectus of the Wtekly J'rww, of Philadelphia, published in another column. Tills Is one of the best of the great Jlctro politan Family Newspapers. IIb.viiv Gi:onoii smilingly reads the news concerning the organization of a new Labor Party, anil shakes himself Into the belief that after all lie may have a chance to make a grab for Central Paik, and get there. lTis astonishing to note the propensity of some Individuals to nurse and fondle the poor l.tboilng man about election time, but not more so than to iiutu with what rapidi ty and precision the poor laborer is bounced after he lias cast Ids vole. Tut: Advocati: gives to its readers to day a fair resume of tho President's mes sage. This is his second annual message to Congress, and will no doubt liavotbe same effect as all picvious letters. Con gress generally does as ' i. pleases, you know. Wi! strlko it pretty square when wc re niaik, that Heniy George Is Jim a little too premature In his free land scheme, llcwaro Henry, beware, don't meddle with Uncle Sam's buzz-saw.

Altciiiiisiiop ItvAN, of Pliiladelphla.has caused much commotion among thu man agers of the Catholic Charity Hall, which for several years lias been a hiilllaut social and financial success in that city, by calling attention to the fact that the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in Its decree prohibits all balls for charitable institutions. He says that none of the proceeds of the ball can be devoted to charitable objects. Tin: refusal of the Western assemblies of the Knights of Labor to pay the assessment asked for by Giand Workman Pouderlv is the subject of much comment amongst la bor men. mid what It portends Is dlllleult to coiiji dure at tills time. It may mean that the laboring masses are awakening to the fact that striking Is a business that don't pay, and that they put their seal of con deumatioH on it by refusing to pay an as sessment, the proceeds of which go to the support of the strikers. If this be the we. then the Knights of Labor have half covered tho ground which leads to sueccs. Do away wlih the strlko and boycott. "A word to the wise," tc Cot.. Vii.as lias saved his salary for this year and the rest of Ids term by making the cleiks earn theirs. Under a section of tho General Statutes the members of the Cabinet are required every winter to tell Congress how many clerks they have In their employ, what their names are, how much they are paid, and whether they work as they ought to. There Is also a clause In the law which says tho Cabinet members must state whether the public service would not be Improved by dispens ing with some of these clerks, and whether their removal and the substitution of oth ers Is not required for the belter despatch of business. Col. Yilas has footed up the absences in Ids department tht past jea, and linds H.'.'tU days were taken olf by' his cleikt, an average of L'Sdajs and -15 lulu nlcs to each clerk.

Special to the Cahiiok Aiivocatk. Perhaps wo may get ns much pleasure and profit by n stroll lit) Hroadway this sunny afternoon as from any other source. Let us try it. The Stock Uoard has closed, and Wall Street Is gradually being emptied Into Hroadway. Trinity chimes three, nnd hundreds of jonng messengers arc. darting hither niul t lilt her. Il'lio can tell the iui port with which those messages are freight ed? To some they carry ruin; to soinchopc; to some fortune. Stand on tho corner here a moment; , Do you tee that plain, nervous inan who looks like a country farmer? that Is S. V. Il'lillc, the broker, who was re. cently elected to Congress in the swallow tailed district In Brooklyn, and who, not withstanding his millions barely escaped defeat by a few hundred majority: right af ter him comes l'.usfcl Sage, who two years ago got stuck for a million on puts and calls; he paid up eventually, but It is said that Ills back has troubled him from that day to this, so that ho takes fewer chances and more certain gilns. There goes Itufus Hatch, Uncle llufus, as the boys call him; a walking enrjclopavlla of human wisdom, and an epitome of everything worth know ing in all Street. That little coupe dash ing along there contains Jay Gould and his :m George. They do say that the new daujliter-ln-Iaw lias captured the old man as much ns the son; lucky .girl, luckv Jay. Ah, here Is a pair of howling swells; what a distinguished air they have they are. the best dressed men on the street. Their dla nionds and style denote them men of wealth and position. Do I know them; of course, I do. One of them Is a faro dealer from Chicago, and tho other keeps a gam bling house on 2.1th Street. That clerical looking young gentleman Imme.lhtely be hind them is a pick-pocket; you would not think it, no; well.t'hat is exact'y the reason that he succeeds so well hi ills business. Yoi; obseive that demure young widow who walks Immediately behind him; watch them, they neither look at, nor speak to each other; to all appearances they are strangers. She, in the polite slang of thievery, is bis Moll. She follows him to take whatever he can pick up in the way of business. If lie can secure a watch or poekctbook, quick as a (lash it Is passed to tins woman, wno at onco disappears with the prize. If the thief is secured, no evi dence of ids crime Is found upon lilni, and as a general thing lie secures his discharge for want of .corioboratlve evidence. Ah, hero we are at Union Square that's the Jlorton House on the cornet'. This block between Hroadway and Fourth Avenue Is the Paradise ofactois. Hero they crowd tho sidewalk, exchanging notes and swap pine jokes, occasionally stepping Into the barroom on tho comer to renew assurances with some young swell, who is desirous of making acquaintance with the profession That very plain looking woman just coming out of the Union Square Theatre is the great tragic actress, Modjeska. 'As she stands talking to that tall young man In the Kngllsh ulster, she looks like anything but a tragic queen. Nat Goodwin thecomedian of the Ilijou Is leaning against the lamp post; and Pioland Heed the great expositor of Humbug is soberly talking to a lady who looks like a Sunday School teacher, but she la not, she i not, she Is one of Daly's prin clpal actresses, an immense, favorite; she took the place of Kdllh Klngdon, who mar ried young George Gould, and rumor says she may make no bad match herself. lint come let us go on. What building is this on the comer of loth Street. Lei u siep in ami see. jieiore us lie caos filled with costly ornaments diamonds. pearls, rubies, amethysts, and all sorts of precious stones and jewels. Gold anil silver ate everywhere, the wealth of the world seems to bn spread out in these marvellous and wonderful cases. There Is a diamond pendent its value Is $,"0,000; a pair of solitaiieearrlngs worth $10.000.and myriads of other costly jewels. This U Tiffany's. Let us step into the little office In the rear. Mr. Tiffany himself U there, and perhaps you may see something yeu never saw lc- foie. At my request he takes carefully from his safe a little case, ho opens It, and there before your wondering gaze Is one of the largest diamonds In the world. It is fiom South Africa, of a palo yellow; almost a topaz in color, hut a genuine, diamond nevertheless. How much is It worth? Oh, only $100,000; If it were pure white, a mil lion would not buy It. lint jump In the elevator and let us go lo the room above. Allaiouud you arc magnificent and costly bronzes, tho finest collection on tho con tinent. In the little room to tho right Is Thaxter's beautiful statue of Lmo's first Dream, and beside It tho likeness of the young sculptor who passed away in life's early morning. Hut we cannot linger here all day, conic let us go. All, here wc are at Lyneh's. Look at that window. Do you know the story It tells? peihaps not. few do; but In that little window Is the saddest of all sad hlsloiies. It is filled with ruined hopes, blighted ambitious, and blasted lives. Oh! yes, there are diamonds there, plenty of them, stones of the purest water and fabul Ions value. That little case of unset stones liefoie joii would purchase a Prince's ran sntn. The store Is not pretentious I admit; hut, Inside tucked away In safes and strong boxes. Is wealth enough to start a dozen Hroadway jewellers. Here come the rich gamblers when luck turns against them, to raise a fresh stake by the s ilo of their costly diamonds, and here too tho soiled doves of tho tteml mviulc come, when misfortune overtakes them, to part wlih the trinkets that have cost them body and soul. 1'uln, bankruptcy and death aro in that window, mixed up with those beautiful jewels. Come let us turn down 2-lrd Street. Splen did Is the pioeesidoii that passes us, and Hundreds of them sweep Into that costly drygnods store, the windows of which aie filled w ith rich silks and laces. .Marvellous ly beautiful aro these tilings, but let us not look at them, they are not intended for such as you and L Across the street is tlie 2:lrd Street Tabernacle, altered by poor old halinl Jlorse for the production of his Passion Play. The last Uine I crossed its threshold, Mr. Morso was busy In the pro duction of lids play, which had been the dream of tils life. Ho was an Oriental scholar, nnd a clot student of tho Hlble. He was a christianized Jew, a'pcrson who seldom has the conlidence of those whose faith he has accepted, and w ho Is universally abhorred by those whose religion he has deserted. When Ibe subject of Mr. Morse's play was mentioned, New York rosoas one man against It. Tho pulpit and tho press lashed it w ttli unrelenting fury. A storm of abuse and vituperation howled aiotnd tho un lucky author, which almost drove him to madness, and did eventually drive him to ruin. The play was a failure and poor Morse, loaded with debt and blighted In bopo, assayed to come the mentor of an ambitious young actress, out of whom he extwied Hi make a Utile money: here loo he Ullcl. mi. filing into a dispute with the nunajer of th tlieatr one night re ceive 1 a bad bca'lug, and In a fit of uespo uiency rusiie.i uown 10 inc iNortli i ... .. ....

New York has seen something of art, nnd knows something of advertising, but nothing has appeared In this city for years, which touches Munkaeiy's, "Christ before Pilate." it was heralded bsfore Its srrlval. with It. nmn llm lm,n,l ,li.l If-l - ........... and since bis arrival lie has had one con tlnital round of leceptlons nm fetes, enough lo turn his head. That Is all ilglil. This is as It should be Tho Prince of tills western world are not.tlio.eorrupt.descend ants of an effete aristocracy, but the in en who have bought their titles to nobility by the works of their own Imperial genius therefore welcome Mavar jlunkacsy, I cannot speak for those whose sole guides are the severe cations of. art, but to the million tho picture is disappointing. 1 do not t 111 n k It Is within the scope ef human genius, lo paint a picture that will satisfy everyone; each .man has his ideal, and each wants the plcttuo painted, as ha conceives It. In tills great cartoon thcra aro about forty figures most of them ltfe size, 'flic principal characters, howerer, are Christ, Pilate nnd Cephas, the accuser of Jesus. Hack among the mob is a ragged vagabond who kees shouting Crucify lilm, crucify him, crucify him; the spear of the ltoman cuard is all that prevents him from rushing on the Saviour. Only ono face beams in pity on the suf ferer, and It is that of a young woman who holds ill her arms a child. Sweet and soothing is the sight of that pitiful face in tho midst of that cruel throng. The figure of Jesii3 Is disappointing; all of the critics have had a fling at it; but It Is worth while before pronouncing judgment to ask our selves if tlie painter Is not poslthely right, and his critics wrong. What warrant have wo for belloving that Christ was dignified or handsome. Ilia public life was ono con tinuous scene of persecution and suffering. He slept whercier chance furnished him a shelter, and ho ate tho bread of charily, and we all know what that means. Tlie night before his trial he had been wander ing, up to the hour of ids betrayal bydudas. In tlie sorrowful Garden of Gelbseniene. When dragged Into Court before Pilate, what wonder that he bore the Incontestable evidences of ids suffering. No halo of glory encircled ids head; no white winged dove hovered over him; bo was human. Al ready In the stern eye of the consul, ho read his cruel s-ntcuce, and In Imagination ho felt the cruel nails and saw the cruel cross; and there lie stands before Pilate not a transfigured Christ not a defiai.t God but a man of sorrow witli his death sentence ringing in his cars. Now in Slunkaesy's pletuic there is neither grandeur nor dignity in the figure of the Saviour, it Is all human, ami a wrecked. nnd surTciiug humanity at that. Tlie effect of the figure of Cephas is destioyi'd by tho figure placed behind it, and which almost appears suspended on tho wall. StHI the press lias been lavish in Its praise, and one of the finest art critics In New York, Herman Scliaus, assured 1110 It was a wonderful picture. The receipts of Its exhibition 111 Europe reached nearly a million of dollars. We aro still busy with our boodlo alder men, and I must confess It is rather uphill work. The prosecution have to get twelve men, thodefenee has only to get one. Heavy odds, and boodle will tell. Stocks are lively. Heal estate booming. General business fair; and these tilings Willi a fair piotnlse of Moody and Sankey, for our benighted neighbors In Brookljn, give us hopes for the fntttre as well as realization for the piesent.
