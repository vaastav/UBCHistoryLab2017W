Electricity dominates invention now adays. A steady stream of new ideas relating to the mysterious fluid is pouring into the patent office. Yet this branch of research is only in its infancy. Before long, if progress con tinues-- at its present rate, the work of the world will be mainly done by elec- Irical apparatus. Already electricity contributes enor mously to the luxury of the rich. The household establishment of Gorgious Midas is fairly run by harnessed light ning. The walls of the dwelling are threaded with a maze of hidden wires, the currents are distributed over it, be ing controlled by switches and auto matic regulators. A complete electric plant in the basement furnishes lights and runs an elevator whhh has no at tendant, being perfectly controlled by push-buttons. On waking in the morning Mr. Midas summons his valet by a push button and presently is notified that his bath is ready. His ablutions are accompanied by a mild scrub with an electric, brush, which produces a pleas ant tingling sensation and is health ful for the skin. Emerging from the iub, he rubs himself to a glow with an electric towel, which is woven on a loose web of very fine fires, so as to be perfectly flexible. Tow-el and brush are connected with a small storage battery, and tlie current may be made as gentle as desired. This also applies to a comb that hangs by the shaving glass. Nobody has yet in vented an electrical razor, but that will come in time. Mr. Midas uses u,u electric tooth brush for the benefit of his gums, and I hen, feeling fit for a little exercise, he devotes five minutes to handling a pair of light dumb-bells. These also are electrical, and give a series of mild shocks to the person employing them. The gentleman is now ready for his breakfast. Ilis coffee is drunk out of a eup of precious metal which is read ily attached to a little battery beneath I he table by booking it to the end of a fine wire. In his loft hand he holds a small clot (rode that terminates an other wire. The act of drinking closes the circuit, ami (lie liquid con veys the electricity to the alimentary canal and stomach. This is not only excellent for digestion, hut it renders more palatable the fluid taken from the cup, because tho electricity stimu lates the organs of taste. Having finished breakfast and read (he morning paper, Mr. Midas takes his hat and cane and starts down town for liis office. The stick has a mas sive gold head and would be a prize for a sneak thief, hut it reposes safely in the hall rack, which has an alarm attachment so us to give instant no tice in case a coal or anything else on it is removed. The cane referred to is itself electrical, sending pleasant thrills through the body of the user. Mr. Midas’ wife, who is musically in clined, spends most of the morning in playing on a piano which is so con trived that she receives a series of shocks while manipulating 1 ho keys, thus undergoing a treatment for rheu matism incidentally to the perform ance, Upstairs the children are play ing with dolls that are made to dance by electricity. All iliis might he considered rather far-fetched were it not (hat patents have been taken out for evciy one of the devices described Mr. Midas occasionally- has an en gagement at his club that keeps him out late. He may decide to have his shoes shined. He drops a nickel into a slot, sits down in a chair and puts ids feet upon two supports provided for the purpose. An electric motor actuates the brushes -first a brush that carries blacking supplied from a reservoir, and then polishing brushes. On his way home several hours later, die night being very- dark, Mr. Midas wishes to know the time. His watch is provided with a very small elec trie-light bulb. In his other waistcoat pocket, connected with the watch by a chain which serves as a conducting wire, is a little battery. An instant’s pressure upon a charm that is at tached to the chain closes the circuit, ignites the lamp and illuminates tlie dial. When Mr. Midas reaches home he lias no trouble in finding the keyhole. He pushes a button and an electric light shines through a round bole* in the door, illuminating the keyhole. As lie enters the house all is silent. The only noise he hears as he passes ids wife’s room is that of the baby’s cradle, which is being rocked by elec tricity. lie retires to tost and dreams that be Is shipwrecked on :• desert is land, where savages amuse themselves by tattooing him with every improper pictures so that he will never again he able to appear in civilized society. The process is infinitely more pain ful than tbe modern method, by which a needle, actuated by electricity, jumps up and down and makes punc tures so rapidly that a line is de- i scribed with it almost as fast as if drawn carefully on paper. Thus the sketch is outlined and is tilled in with a similar machine carrying five nee dles and making a stripe one-eight of an inch wide. The needles arc dipped in vermilion for red. To turn out a tattooed man in this wise, all ready for exhibition. icsts only $2OO. Of course, Mr. Midas has an elec tric pleasure boat. The power for running it is contained in storage bat teries concealed under the seats. Elec tricity is rapidly coming into use for navigation. It is said that electric boats arc replacing gondolas in Ven ice. Anew Invention is an electric float for the life-saving service. It is sent out through the surf to a dis tressed vessel, being propelled and steered from the shore and carrying an electric lamp of several hundred candle-power. An improved life-buoy is provided with an electric light, so that it may attract the attention of a drowning person when it is thrown overboard.
