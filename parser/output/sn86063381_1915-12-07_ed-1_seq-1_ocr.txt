MUCH READY MONEY IN WEST, SAYS ATTORNEY There is a great abundance of ready money in the west, according to Attorney E. E. McDonald, who re turned Sunday from a trip to the San Francisco exposition. He added, however, that he would not trade one acre of land in Minnesota for all the land on the other side of the Rockies. "There were 19,000,000 people who attended the exposition," said Mr. McDonald. "I judge that 17,000,000 of these came from points outside of California If each man spent only $25 while in California that would mean $470,000,000. California has three things of which it can boast, delightful climate, the ocean and beautiful flowers." Mrs. McDonald and Mrs. H. Jenks of Minneapolis, who accompanied Mr. McDonald on his trip west, will re main in the west to visit for some time. They expect to leave Dec. 17 for a trip to Honolulu.

NEW ARMORY TO BE BUILT FOR NAVAL MILITIA Application is Made to State Board Building it to Cost 117,000. CITY TO DONATE SITE CITIZENS TO RAISE $2,000 Council Meets and Considers Routine Meeting New Market is Established. Bemidji will have a new armory for the naval militia. Application has been made to the state armory board for state aid, the city council at its meeting last eve ning made plans for the donating of a site and efforts are being made to raise by popular subscription the bal ance of the funds that are necessary to secure the armory. The state legislature Annually ap propriates $30,000 for the building of armories. This money has been expended this year and applications are now being received for the appro priation for the next fiscal year which begins in August, 1916. The state donates $15,000 toward the con struction of the armory on the con dition that the city furnish a site and $1,000. An effort will be made to secure $2,000 instead of $1,000 as the armory that is desired will cost $17,000. The proposed site- for the new ar mory is at the end of Fourth street on Lake Bemidji. At the meeting of the city council last evening Lieutenant E. A. Barker of the naval militia told the city council of the action that is being taken by the militia. According to Lieut. Barker, the armory will be 125 feet deep and in front will have two floors. The drill hall will be but one floor and will be 90 by 62 feet. The city council appointed the city attorney and the city engineer to in vestigate the site and to call a special meeting of the council for immediate action. The council refused the request of Conrad Lajambe to cut the trees on 13th street'betVeen IrflSfirand' Am erica avenue. The council granted the city engineer the right to allow anyone who is in need to cut the trees on certain streets. Trees will probably be but on Doud avenue and 15th street. A wood, hay and produce market was established on Second street be tween America and Minnesota av enues. The market formerly was on Fourth street between Minnesota and Beltrami avenues. The city clerk was authorized to advertise for 125 cords of three-foot green wood. Aldermen Lycan, Ervin, Miller, Bailey, Lahr, Phillippi and Foucault were present at the session of the council last evening. BIG 

BUSINESS ASKS STR0N6 TARIFF AGAIN Chicago, Dec. 7.Big business men here today from all parts of the country will confer on a tariff pro gram representing their views. Wholesale changes in the present tariff will be asked, it is said. The conference was under the auspices of the Illinois Manufacturers' asso ciation. "The tariff is not producing suf ficient revenue to meet the increas ing expense of our national admin istration which undoubtedly will be added to it when we increase our army and navy," said B. A. Eckhart, head of a milling company here. "When the war is over the United States will be the one cash market in the world. European manufac turers will try to unload here to make up for lost profits. The tariff should be reconstructed to protect the welfare of our workers, skilled and unskilled, and solely with the object of protecting and stimulating the trade upon which general pros perity depends." It Was Not Like This in The Days Of Old DEM. 

NATIONAL 1 COMMITTEE MEETS i 1916 Fresidssitial Campaign is Launched Convention to Be Held in June. Washington, Dec. 7.The 1916 presidential campaign was launched here today with the Democratic na tional committee selecting a place and time for the Democratic national convention. The Republican com mittee meets here a week from today to do the same. The Democratic committeemen favor June. President Wilson's renomination was not questioned by the Democratic chieftains. Other features of the campaign, including renomination of Vice President Marshall, were much discussed, informally. Democratic leaders, warhorses and politicians, the usual entourage of the national committee's annual meeting and the committees from cities seeking the convention, were here as usual. President Receives Delegates. President Wilson received the com mittee in a body at the White House. His address was regarded as the Democratic keynote for the forth coming contest. That the president had no preference regarding the time or place for holding the convention was officially announced. The White House reception preceded the president's appearance before the joint session of the senate and the house to deliver his annual messages to congress. There was much verbal speculation regarding the alleged movement to oust William F. Mc Coombs of New York as chairman. Friends of Fred B. Lynch of Minne sota were said to be active in trying to have him succeed McCoombs. Party leaders insisted the rumors were without foundation. Among the cities bidding for the convention were Chicago, St Louis, Dallas, San Fran cisco and Omaha. Lengthy argu ments and pyrotechnics were sched uled. Called to order at 11 o'clock at the New Willard hotel by Chairman Mc Coombs, the morning session was largely routine. Eight Vacancies. There were eight vacancies on the committee. In two of these there wjere contests, from Oregon and Xen-_ tucky. Urey Woodson and Gen. W. Haldeman were the contestants for Kentucky's seat and Will R. King and H. M. Easterly for Oregon's. Both contests presented novel tangles. Woolson was chosen by the Kentucky state committee. At last summer's state convention Gen, Haldeman was named national committeeman. A similar family quarrel was the Ore gon contest. King was selected by the Oregon state committee and in last year's primary election Easterly was chosen by the Democratic voters. Democratic precedent provides full four-year terms for each committee man. The national committee was presented with the problem of over throwing choices of state commit tees, according to established prece dent, by recognizing the choice of a party convention and the rank and file in a primary contest. Full auth ority and discretion was vested in the committees to decide the con tests. Other new members seated today were: Vincent Miles of Little Rock, Ark., to succeed W. H. Kavanaugh, former president of the Southern Baseball league, deceased John T. Barnett of Denver, Colo., succeeding Thomas J. McCue, deceased W. W. Marsh, of Waterloo, la., succeeding Martin J. Wade, appointed a federal judge Charles E. Johnson of Water ville, Me., succeeding E. L. Jones, resigned, Representative Cordell Hull of Carthage, Tenn., succeeding R. E. L. Mountcastle, deceased, and Z. R. (Continued on Page i)

Earnest Thompson Seton, author and natur alist, has resigned his position of chief scout of the Boys Scouts of Am erica, as a result of the change in policies of the organization. Mili tarism, since the gradual change, is now the foremost purpose of the scouts, while the purpose for which it was organized was to make outdoor children of the scouts. Mr. Seton is strongly opposed to the change. Attorney P. W. Mebey of Thief River Falls is a visitor in the city today. By "HOP TORiCA1 SQCHETV SOKTT CEBTS FEE M.01TH. Annual Address Shocks Congress Host Far-Reaching Ever Given. WORDS SNAP WITH VIGOR BURN WITH STRENGTH Asks That Law Be Passed at Once Against Disloyalty in Na- tional life. War Disciplined Might. "But war has never been a mere matter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined might.- If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immedi ately available and immediately ef fective. And the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it. The military arm of their gov ernment, which they will not allow to direct them, they may properly --is Washington, Dec. 7.In words fairly snapping with vigor and burn ing with vitrillic strength, President Wilson at noon today hurled to con gress in his annual message a de nunciation of hyphenated American ism. His annual message was a shock to congress. The bitter words with which he embellished his de termination that congress take cog nizance of corrupted mind and heart of those who had poured disloyalty into the national life, rang out in the house of representatives. Over 2,000 people were jammed in the hall to hear the message which was prob ably the most far-reaching in effect of any in the history of the country. Must Save Honor. In regard to hyphenated Americans President Wilson said: "I am sorry to say that the gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. These are citizens of the United States, I blush to ad mit, born under other flags but wel comed under our own generous natur alization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America, who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life who have sought to bring the auth ority of our good name of our gov ernment into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindictive pur poses to strike at them and debase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue. America never witnessed anything like this before. I urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment to deal with this movement. I am urging this to save the honor and^elf respect of the na- tion." President .Wilson's address in part, is as follows: "We have stood apart, studiously neutral. It was our manifest duty to do so. Not only did we have no part or interest in the policies which seem to have brought the European conflict on it was necessary, if a universal catastrophe was to be avoid ed, that a limit should be set to the sweep of destructive war and ihat some part of the great family of na tions should keep rhe processes of peace alive, if only to prevent col lective economic ruin and the break down throughout the world of the industries by which its populations are fed and sustained. The states cf America have become conscious of a new and more vital community of interest and moral partnership in af fairs, more clearly conscious of the many common sympathies and inter ests and duties which bid them stand together. Have Stood Test. "We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued remains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take advantage of her in her distress and undertake to impose up on her an order and government of our own choosing. "We will aid and befriend Mexico, but we will not coerce her and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all America that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control. "The moral is, that the states of America are not hostile rivals but co operating friends, and that their growing sense of community, of in terest, alike in matters political and in matters economic, is likely to give them a new significance as factors in international affairs and in the polit ical history of the world. "This is Pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire in it. It is the embodiment, the effectual em bodiment, of the spirit of law and in dependence and liberty and mutual service.
