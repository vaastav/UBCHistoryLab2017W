PRESIDENT TAFT DELIVERS FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE He Favors Ship Subsidy, Postal Banks and Civil Service Pension Plan. HOT TOASTING FOR ZELAYA Amendment of Interstate Commerce and Anti-Trust Laws, He An nounces, Will Be Handled in Special Message. Washington Special—Following is a summary of President Taft's first annual message which was delivered to both houses of congress: After reviewing at considerable length the satisfactory relations be tween the United Stales and Kuropcan powers, President Tat't takes up the relations between this country and l^utiii-America, saying in part: Protect American Capital. Today, inure than ever belore, Ameri can capital is seeking mvcatniciu in for eign countries, and American products are more and more generally seeking for eign maikets. As a consequence, In all countries there are American citizens and American interests to he protected, on occasion, by tiiuir government. These movements of men, of capital, and of commodities bring peoples and govern ments ciuser together and so form bonds ot peace and mutual dependency, as they must aiao naturally ••.unieiimes make passing p^inis of friction. The resultant situation inevitably imposes upon this government \astly increased responsibil ities. This administration, through the department ul' stale and the fore.gn serv ice, is lending all proper support to legit imate and benelieial American enterprises in loieign countries, the degree of such support being measured by the national advantages to be expected. A citizen him»elt oan Hoc by contract or otherwise divest himself of the right, nor can this government escape the obligation, of his protection in his personal and property rights when these are unjustly infringed in a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless \exatiuns it is proper that in consider ing whether American enterprise should be encouraged or supported In a partic ular country, the government should give full weight not only to the national, as opposed to the individual benefits to ac crue, but also to the fact whether or not the government of the country in ques tion is in its administration and in its diplomacy faithful to the principles of moderation, equity and justice upon which alone depend international credits, in diplomacy as well as in finance. The Pan-American policy of this gov ernment has long been fixed in its prin ciples and remains unchanged. With the changed circumstances of the United States and of the republics to the south of us, most of which have great natural resources, stable government and pro gressive ideals, the apprehension which gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be said to have nearly disappeared, and neither the doctrine as it exists nor any other doctrine of American policy should bo permitted to operate for the perpetua ation of irresponsible, government, the escape of just obligations, or the insidi ous allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the United States. He side the fundamental doctrines of our Pan-American policy there have grown up a realization of political in terests, community of institutions and ideals, and a flourishing commerce. Ail these bonds will be greatly strengthened as time goes on. and increased facilities, such as the great bank soon to be estab lished in I-atin America, supply the means for building up the colossal Inter continental commerce of the future- Meeting With Diaz. My meeting with President Diaz and the gieeting exchanged on both American and Mexican soil served, I hope, to sig nalize- the close and cordial relations which so well bind together this repub lie the great republic immediately to the south, between which there is so •vast a network of material interests. ani happy to say that all but one ol the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been set tled within the past few months, and mat, under the enlightened regime now uirev-lmtf the government of Venezuela provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague tribunal. & On July 30, 1909, the government of Pan ama agieed, aft^r considerable negotia tion, to indemnify the relatives of the American officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them having in this year" klll by th Panaman Police The sincere desire of the government of 1 anama to do away with a situation where such an accident could occur is man'lest in the recent request in com pliance with which this government has lent the services of an officer of the jjniy to bo employed by the government 0l™i' a lI T'a as instructor of police. 1 lie collection of the customs of the Dominican republic through the general receiver tif customs appointed by the president of the United States in ac cordance _\viI the convention of Febru ary 8, 11101, has proceeded in an unevent ful and sutisluctorv manner This government was obliged to inter vene diplomatically to bring about arbi tration or settlement of the claim of the Winery company against Nicaragua, iii °ng before been agreed should be arbitrated. A settlement of this troublesome case was reached bv lw"" aUlre a rotoco1 on September Many years ago diplomatic intervention became necessary to the protection of the interests in the American claim of Aslon & Company against the government of Chile. 1 here had been two abortive at tempts to do so through arbitral com missions, which failed through lack of Jurisdiction. Now, happily, as the re sult of the recent diplomatic negotiations the governments of the United States and of Chile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cor dial and trlendly relations upon which both set such store, have agreed by a protocol to submit the controversy to definitive settlement by His Britannic Majesty, Edward VII. Zelaya Is Scored. Since the Washington conventions of 1907 were communicated to the govern ment of the United States as a consult ing and advising party, this government has been almost continuously called upon by one or another, and in turn by all of the five Central American republics to exert itself for the maintenance of the conventions. Nearly every complaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nica ragua, which has kept Central America in constant tension or turmoil. The re sponses made to the representations of Central American republics, as due from the United States on account of its rela tion to the Washington conventions, have been .u all times conservative and have avoided, so far as possible, any sem blance cf Interference, although it is very apparent thai the considerations of geo graphic proximity to the canal zone and of the very -ubstantial American inter ests In Central America give to the United Stales a special position in the zone cf these republics and the Carib bean sea I need not rehearse here the patient ef forts of this government to promote peace and welfare among these republics, ef forto which are fully appreciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true irderens. It would be no less un necessary to rehearse here the sad tale of unspeakable barbarities and oppres Bion alleged to have been committed by the Zelaya government. Recently two Americans were put io death by order of President Zeiaya himself. They were re ported to have been regularly commis sioned officers in the organized forces of a revolution which had continued many weeks and was proceeding in an orderly fasiiion in control of about half of the republic• and as such, according to the modern enlightened practice of civilized rations, they would be entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of war. At the date when this emessage J# printed this government is proceeding witfe deliberate circumspection to deter­ mine the exact truth in relation to these reports and upon the course In the prem ises most consistent with its dignity, its duty to American interests and Its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization. The Far East. In the far east this government pre serves unchanged its policy of support ing the principle of equality of opportun ity and scrupulous respect for the integ rity of the Chinese empire, to which pol icy are pledged the interested powers ot both east and west. By the treaty of 1903 China has under taken the abolition of likin with a mod erate and proportionate raising of the customs tariff along with currency re form. These reforms being of manifest advantage to foreign commerce as well as to the Interests of China, this gov ernment is endeavoring to facilitate these measures and the needful acquiescence of treaty powers. When it appeared that Chinese likin revenues were to be hypoth ecated to foreign bankers in connection with a great railway project, it was ob vious that the governments whose na tionals held this loan would have a cer tain direct interest in the question of the carrying out by China of the reforms in question. Because this railroad loan rep resented a practical and real applica tion of the open door policy through co operation with China by interested pow ers as well as because of its relations to the reforms referred to above, the admin istration deemed American participation to be of great national interest. Happily, when it was as a matter of broad policy urgent that this opportunity should not be lost, the indispensable instrumentality presented itself when a group of Amer ican bunkers, of international reputation and great resources, agreed at once to share in the loan upon precisely such terms ^js this government should approve. The chief of those terms was that Amer ican railway material should be upon an exact equality with that of the other na tionals joining in the loan in the placing of orders for tills whole railroad system. After months of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured. It is gratifying that Americans will thus take their share in this exten sion of these great highways of trade, and to believe that such activities will give a real impetus to our commerce and will prove a practical corollary to our historic policy in the far east. In one of the Chinese-Japanese con ventions ol September -1 of this year there was a provision which caused con siderable public apprehension in that upon its face it was believed in some quarters to seek to establish a monopoly of mining privileges along the South Manchurian and Aiming-Slukclen rail roads, and thus to exclude Americans from p. w'de field of enterprise, to take part in which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a thorough exam ination of the conventions and of the several contextual documents, the secre- I tary of state reached the conclusion that no such monopoly was intended or ac complished. However, in view of the widespread discussion of this question, to confirm the view it had reached, this government made inquiry of the impe rial Chinese and Japanese governments and received from each official assurance that the provision had no purpose incon sistent with the policy of equality of op portunlty to which the signatories, in common with the United Stales, are pledged. Our traditional relations with the Jap anese empire continue cordial as usual, The ai rangement of WOS for a co-opera tive control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily. The matter of revision of the existing treaty between the United I States and Japan which is terminable in 3912 is already receiving the study of both countries. Department of State. I earnestly recommend to the favorable action of the congress the estimates sub mitted by the department of state and most especially the legislation suggested in the secretary of state's letter of this date whereby It will be possible to devel op and make permanent the reorganiza tion cf the department upon modern lines in a manner to make it a thoroughly ef ficient instrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American In- I terests abroad. The consular service has been greatly improved under the law of April 5, ]90G, and the executive order of June 27, 1906, and I commend to your consideration the question of embodying in a statute the principles of the present executive order upon which the efficiency of our consular service is wholly dependent. Government Expenditures. I Perhaps the most important question presented to this administration is that of economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The deficit of the last fiscal year, ai.d the certain deficit of ihe cur rent year, prompted congress to throw a I greater responsibility oil the executive and the secretary of the treasury than had heretofore been declared by statute. This declaration imposes upon the sec retary of the treasury the duty of assem bling all the estimates of the executive I department's bureaus, and offices, of the expenditures necessary in the ensuing lis cal year, and of making an estimate of the revenues of the government for .the same period and if a probable deficit is thus shown, ir is made the dutv of the president to recommend the methods by which such deficit can be met. The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will ex ceed the estimated receipts by $34,075,620. If to this deficit is added the sum to be disbursed for the Panama canal, amount ing to $38,000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be in creased to a total deficit of $73,075,620. This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal. I approve this proposal. The policy of paying for the construc tion of the Panama canal, not out of cur rent revenue, but by bond issues, was adopted In the Spooner act of 1902, and there seems to be.no good reason for de parting from the principle by which a part at least of the burden of the cost of the canal shall fall upon our posterity who are tc enjoy it: and there is all the more reason for this view because the actual cost to date of the canal, which is now half done and which will be com pleted by January 1, 1915, shows that the cost of engineering and construction will be $297,766,000. instead of $139,705,200, as originally estimated. In addition to en gineering and construction, the other ex penses, including sanitation and govern ment, and the amount paid for the prop erties, the franchise, and the privilege of building the canal, increase the cost by $75,435,000. to a total of $375,201,000. The increase in the cost of engineering and construction is due to a substantial en largement of the plan of construction by widening the canal 100 feet in the Cule bra cut and by increasing the dimensions of the locks, to the underestimate of the quantity of the work to be done under the original plan, and to an underestimate of the cost of labor and materials both of which have greatly enhanced In price since the original estimate was made. Low Estimates Made. In order to avoid a deficit for the ensu ing fiscal year, I directed the heads of de partments in the preparation of their esti mates to make them as low as possibie consistent with imperative governmental necessity. The result has been, as I am advised by the secretary of the treasury, that the estimates of the expenses of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911—that is, for the next fiscal year—are less by $55,663,000 than the total of appropriations for the current fiscal year, and less by $94,000,000 than the esti mates for that year. So far as the secre tary of the treasury Is able to form a judgment as to future income, and com pare it with the expenditure for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, including the payments on account of the Panama canal and the public debt, there will be no deficit in the year ending June 30, 1911, but a small surplus of $712,000. In the present estimates the needs of the departments and of the government have been cut to the quick, so to speak, and any assumption on the part of con gress, so often made in times past, that the estimates have been prepared with the expectation that they may be reduced, will result in seriously hampering proper administration. It has been impossible in the prepara tion of estimates greatly to reduce the cost of permanent administration. This can not De done without a thorough re organization ot bureaus, offices, and de partments. For the purpose of securing Information which may enable the execu tive and the legislative branches to unite In a plan for the permanent reduction of the cost of governmental administration, the treasury department has instituted an Investigation by one of the most skilled expert accountants in the United States. The mult ot his work la two or three 1 bureaus, which. If extended to the en tire government, must occupy two or more years, lias been to show much room for improvement and opportunity for sub stantial reductions In the cost and In creased efficiency of administration. The object of the investigation is to devise means to increase the average efficiency of each employe. There is great room for improvement toward this end, not only by the reorganization of bureaus and departments and in the avoidance of duplication, but also in the treatment of the individual employe. Favors Civil Pensions. More than this, every reform directed toward the improvement in the average efficiency of government employes must depend on the ability of the executive to eliminate from the government service those who are inefficient from any cause, and as the degree of efficiency in all the departments Is much lessened by the re tention of old employes who have out lived their energy and usefulness, it is indispenslble to any proper system ot' economy that provision be made so that their separation from the service shall bo easy and inevitable. It is Impossible to make such provision unless there is adopted a plan of civil pensions. Most of the great Industrial organiza tions, and many of the well conducted railways of this country, are coming to the conclusion that a system of pensions for old employes, and the substitution therefrr of younger and more energetic servants, promotes both economy and ef ficiency of administration. I am aware that there is a strong feel ing in both houses of congress, and pos sibly in this country, against the estab lishment of civil pensions, and that this has naturally grown out of the lieavv burden of military pensions, which it has always been the policy of our government to assume: but am strongly convinced that no other practical solution of the difficulties presented by the superannu ation of civil servants can bo found than that of a system of civil pensions. Frauds in the Collection of Customs. 1 regret to refer to the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds in the col lection of the customs revenue ai New York City, in which a number of the subordinate employes in the weighing and other departments were directly con cerned, and In which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining com pany and others. The frauds consisted in the payment of duty on underweights of sugar. The government has recovered from the American Sugar Refining com pany all thai It is shown to have been defrauded of. The sum was received in full of the amount due, which might have been recovered by civil suit against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an express reservation in the contract of settlement by which the settlement should not interfere with, or prevent the criminal prosecution of everyone who was found to be subject to tile same. Criminal prosecutions are now proceed ing against a number of the government officers. The treasury department and the department of justice are exerting every effort to discover all the wrong doers, including the officers and em pi yes of the companies who may have been privy to the fraud. It would seem to me that an investigation of the frauds by congress at present, pending the prob ing by the treasury department and the department of justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and otherwise prove an embarrassment in securing conviction of the guilty parties. Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference. By virtue of the clause known as the "Maximum and Min imum" clause, it Is the duty of the ex ecutive to consider the laws and prac tices of other countries with reference to the importation into those couniries of the products and merchandise of the United States, and if the executive finds such laws and practices not to be unduly discriminatory against the United States, the minimum duties provided in the bill are to go into force. Unless the pres ident makes such a finding, then the maximum duties provided in the bill, that Is, an increase of 25 per cent ad valorem over the minimum duties, are to be In force. Fear has been expressed that this power conferred and duty imposed on the executive Is likely to lead to a tariff war. beg to express the hope and belief that no such result need be anticipated. The discretion granted to the executive by the terms "unduly discriminatory" is wide. In order that the maximum duty shall be charged against the imports from the country, it Is necessary that he shall find on the part of that country not only discrimination in its laws or the practice under them against the trade of the United States, but that the discrimina tions found shall be undue that is, without good and fair reason. I conceive that this power was reposed in the pres ident with the hope that the maximum duties might never be applied in any case, but that the power to apply them would enable the president nnd the stale department through friendly negotia tions to secure the elimination from the laws and the practice under them of any foreign country of that which is unduly discriminatory. No one is seeking a tariff war or a condition In which the spirit of retaliation shall be aroused. Use of Tariff Board. The new tariff law enables me fa ap point a tariff board to assist me in con nection with the department of state in the administration of the minimum and maximum clause of the act and also te assist officers of the government in the administration of the entire law. An ex amination of the law and an understand ing of the nature of the facts which should be considered in discharging the functions imposed upon' the executive show that I have the power to direct the tariff board to make a comprehensive glossary and encyclopedia of the terms used and articles embraced in the tariff law, and to secure information as to On cost of production of such goods in this country and the cost of their production in foreign countries. 1 have therefore ap pointed a tariff board consisting of three members and have directs!-them to per form all the duties above described. This work will perhaps take two or three years, and I ask congress a continuing annual appropriation equal to thai al ready made for its prosecution. I believe that the work of this board will be of prime utility and importance whenever congress shall deem It wise again io readjust the customs duties. If the facts secured by the tariff board are of such a character as to show generally that the rates of duties imposed by the present tariff law are excessive under the princi ples of protection as described in the platform of the successful party at the late election, I shall not hesitate to in vite the attention of congress to this fact and to the necessity for action predicated thereon. Nothing, however, halts busi ness and interferes with the course of prosperity so much as the threatened re vision of the tariff, and until the facts are at hand, after careful and deliberate I investigation, upon which such revision can properly be undertaken, it seems to me unwise to attempt it. The amount of misinformation that creeps into argu ments, pro and con In respect to tariff rates Is such as to require the kind «f investigation that I have directed the tariff board to make, an investigation un dertaken by It wholly without respect to the effect which the facts may have in calling for a readjustment of the rates of duty. War Department. In the Interest of Immediate economy and because of the prospect of a deficit, I have required a reduction in the cstl mates of the war department for the coming fiscal year, which brings the total estimates down to an amourjt $45,000,/W less than the corresponding estimates for last year. This could only be accom plished by cutting off new projects and suspending for the period of one year all progress In military matters. For the same reason I have directed that the army shall not be recruited up to its present authorized strength The secretary of war calls attention to a number of needed changes in the array in all of which I concur, but the point upon which I place most emphasis Is tlio need for an elimination bill providing a method by which the merits of officers shall have some effect upon their ad vancement and by which the advance ment of all may bi accelerated by the effective elimination of a definite propor portlon of the least efficient. There are In every army, and certainly in ours, a number of officers who do not violate their duty in any such way as to give reason for a court-martial or dismissal, but who do not show such aptitude and skill and character for high command as to justify their remaining In the active service to be promoted. Provision should be made by which they may be retired on a certain proportion of their pay, in creasing with their length of service at the time of retirement. There is now a personnel law for the navy which Itself needs amendment and to which I shall make further reference. Such a law is nSSJ?ed "iulte tor the army. 1 The return ot *he battle «hlp fleet from its voyage around the world, in more ef ficient condition than when It started, was a noteworthy event of interest alike to our citizens and the naval authorities of the world. Besides the beneficial and far-reaching effect on our personal and diplomatic relations In the countries which tile fleet visited, the marked suc cess of the ships in steaming around the world In all weathers on schedule tlmo has increased resject for our navy and has added to our national prestige. Our enlisted personnel recruited from all sections of the country is youny and energetic and representative of the na tional spirit. It is, moreover, owing to its intelligence, capable of quick training into the modern mnn-of-warsmen. Our officers are earnest and zealous In their profession, but it Is a regrettable fact that the higher officers are old for the responsibilities of the modern navy, and the admirals do not arrive at flag rank young enough to obtain adequate train ing lc their duties as flag officers. This need Vor reform in the navy has been ably and earnestly presented to congress by my predecessor, and I also urgently rec ommend the subject for consideration. Early In the coming session a compre hensive plan for the reorganization of the officers of all corps of the navy will be presented to congress, and I hope It will meet with action suited to Its ur gency. Expedition in Legal Procedure. The deplorable delays in the adminis tration of civil and criminal law have received the attention of committees of the American liar association and of many state bar associations, as well as the considered thought of Judges a'nd Jurists. In my judgment, a change In ju dicial procedure, with a view to reducing its expense to private litigants in civil cases and facilitating the dispatch of business and final decision In both civil and criminal cases, constitutes the great est need In our American institutions. I do not doubt for one moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty ex hibited in lynchings is directly due io the uncertainties and Injustice growing out of the delays in trials, judgments and the executions thereof by our courts. Of course these remarks apply quite as well to the administration of justice in state courts as to that in federal courts, and without making Invidious distinction it is perhaps nut too nun to say tluit, speak Ing generally, the defects are less in the federal courts than in the state courts. Hut they are very great in the federal courts. The expedition with which business is disposed of both on the civil and ihe criminal side of Kngllsh courts under modern rules of procedure makes the delays In our courts seem archaic and barbarous. The procedure in the federal courts should furnish an ex ample for the state courts. I presume it Is impossible, without an amendment to the constitution, to unite under one form of action the proceedings at common law and proceedings in equity in the federal courts, but it is certainly not impossible by a statute to simplify aiid make short and direct the procedure both at law and in equity in those courts. It is not im possible to cut down still more than it is cut down, the jurisdiction of the supreme court so as to confine It almost wholly to statutory and constitutional questions. Under the present statutes the equity and admiralty procedure in the federal courts is under the control of the supreme court, but in the pressure of business to which that court is subjected. It 1b impossible to hope that a radical and proper reform of the federal equity procedure can bo brought about. I therefore recommend legislation providing for the appointment by the president of a commission with authority to examine tho law and equity procedure of the federal courts of first instance, tho law of appeals from those courts to the courts of appeals and to tho supreme court, and the costs imposed in such procedure upon the private litigants and upon tho public treasury and make recommendation with a view to simpli fying and expediting the procedure as far as possible and making It as Inexpensive as may be to the litigant of little means. Injunctions Without Notice. The platform of the successful party In the last election contained the following: "The republican party will uphold at all times the authority and integrity of tho courts, state and federal, and will ever Insist that their powers to enforce their process and to protect life, liberty, and property shall be preserved Inviolate. We believe, however, that the rules of procedure In the federal courts with re spect to the Issuance of the writ of In junction should be more accurately de fined by statute, and that no Injunc tion rr temporary restraining order should be issued without notice, except where irreparable Injury would result from delay, in which case a speedy hear ing thereafter should be granted." I recommend that in compliance with the promise thus made, appropriate leg islation be adopted. The ends of justice will best be met and the chief cause of complaint against ill-considered injunc tions without notice will be removed by the enactment of a statute forbidding hereafter the issuing of any injunction or restraining order, whether temporary or permanent, by any federal court, with out previous notice and a reasonable op portunity to be heard on behalf of the parties to be enjoined: unless it shall appear to tho satisfaction of tho court: that tho delay necessary to give such no tice and hearing would result in irrepar able injury to the complainant and unless also the court shall from the evidence make a written finding, which shall be spread upon the court minutes, that im mediate and Irreparable injury is likely to ensue to the complainant, and shall define the Injury, state why it is Irrep arable, and shall also endurse on the or der issued the date and the hour of the issuance of the order. Moreover, every such injunction or restraining order .is sued without previous notice and oppor tunity by the defendant to be heard should by force of the statute expire and be of no effect after seven days from the issuance thereof or within any time less than that period which the court may fix. unless within such seven days or Bucli less period, the Injunc^'on or ordei is extended or renewed after previous no tice and opportunity be heard. My judgment is that the passage of such an act which really embodies Ihe best practice in equity and Is very like the rule now In force in some courts will prevent the issuing of ill-advised or ders of injunction without notice and will render such orders when issued much less objectionable by the short time In which they may remain effective. Anti-Trust Commerce Laws. The jurisdiction of the general govern ment over interstate commerce has led to the passage of the so-called "Sherman anti-trust law" and the "Interstate com merce law" and Its amendments. The developments in the operation of those laws, as shown by Indictments, trials, ju dicial decisions, and other sources of in formation. call for a discussion and some suggestions as to amendments. These I prefer to embody In a special message in stead of including them in the present communication, and I shall avail myself of the first convenient opportunity to bring these subjects to the attention of congress. Postoffice Department. The deficit every year in the post office department is largely caused by the low rate of postage of 1 cent a pound charged on second class mall matter, which in cludes not only newspapers but maga zines and miscellaneous periodicals. Tho actual loss growing out of the transmis sion of this second class mail matter at 1 cent a pound amounts to about $63,000,000 a year. The average cost of the trans portation of this matter is more than 9 cents a pound. It appears that the average distance ovjer which newspapers are delivered to their customers Is 291 miles, while the average haul of magazines is 1,049, and of miscellaneous periodicals 1,128 miles. Thus, the average haul of the magazine Is three and one-half times and that of the miscellaneous periodical nearly four times the haul of the daily newspaper, yet all of them pay the same postage rate of 1 cent a pound. The statistics of 1907 show that second class mail matter constituted 63.91 per cent of the weight of all the mail, and yielded only 6.19 per cent of the revenue. The figures given are startling, and show the payment by the government of an enormous subsidy to the newspapers magazines, and periodicals, and congress may well consider whether radical steps should not be taken to reduce the deficit in the post office department caused by this discrepancy between the actual cost of transportation and the compensation exacted therefor. A great saving might be made, amount ing to much more than half of the loss, by Imposing upon magazines and period icals'a higher rate of postage. They are much heavier than newspapers, and con tain ft. much higher proportion of adver tising to reading matter, and the average distance of their transportation la three and a half times as great. I commend the whole subject to con i, not unmindful of the spread of In­ telligence which a low charge for carry ing newspaiers and periodicals assists. 1 very much doubt, however, the wisdom of a policy which constitutes so large a subsidy and requires additional taxation to meet It. Postal Savings Banks. The second subject worthy of mention In the post office department Is the real necessity and entire variability of es taolishing postal savings banks. The suc cessful party at the last election declared In favor of postal savings banks, and a.though the proposition finds, opponents in many parts of the country, I am con vinced n: the people desire such banks, and am sure :h,-t when lie banks are furnished they iiili b" oroductive of the utmost good. The postal savings banks are not constituted for the purpose of creating competition with otner banks. Ihe rate of interest upon deposits to which they would be limited would be so small as to prevent their drawing depos its away from other banks. I believe them to be necessary In or der to offer a proper Inducement to thrift and saving tu a great many people of small means who do not now have bank ing facilities, and to whom such a sys tem would offer an opportunity for the accumulation of capital. They will fur nish a satisfactory substitute, based on sound principle and actual successful li nil In m-urly Ail ihe countries of ilu» world, for the system of government guaranty of deposits now being adopted In several western states, which with deference to those who advocate it seems to me to have in it the seeds of demorali zation to conservative banking and cer tain financial disaster. The question of how the money depos Ited In postal savings banks shall be In vested is not free from difficulty, but believe that a satisfactory provision IV this purpose was inserted its an amend ment to the bill ''Onsldered by tin? Scnatt at its last session. It has been propose to delay the consideration of legisialioi establishing a postal savings bank until after the report of the monetary oommis sion. This report is iikelv to be delayed and properly so, because or the net ess it.\ for car-'ful deliberation ami close in vestigatlon. 1 do not see whv tin one should belled up with the othi It Is understood that the motieiarv commission have looked into tin systems of banking which now prcvai abroad, nnd have found that by a cimtru there exercised in respc-ct to reserves am tho rates of exchange by some central au thority panics are avoided, it is not up parent that a system of postal saving: banks would in any way Interfere will a change to such a system here. Certain Iv in most of the countries in Kumpt where control is thus exercised by a cen tral authority, postal savings batiks exisl and arc not thought to he Inconsistent with a proper financial and banking sys tem. Ship Subsidy. Following the course of my distln guisiitd predecessor, 1 earnestly reeom mend to congress the consideration aim passage of a ship subsidy bill, looking it the establishment of lines between oui Atlantic seaboard and the eastern coasi of South America, as w-ell as lines Iron the west coast of the United States t«. South America, China, Japan, and tin Philippines. The profits on foreign mailt are perhaps a sufficient measure of tlit expenditures which might first be tenta tively applied to this method of Inducing American capital to undertake the estab lishment of American lines of steamships in those directions In which we now feel It most important that we should hav. means of transportation controlled in ht interest of the expansion of our trade A bill of tills character has once passed the House and more than once passed tlif Senate, and I hope that at this session a bill framed on the same lines anil with the same purposes may become a law. New Mexico and Arizona. The successful party in the last electlor, In its national platform declared in favot of the admission as separate states of New Mexico and Arizona, and I recommend that legislation appropriate to this end be adopted. I urge, however, that care bi exercised in the preparation of the legisla tion affecting each territory to secure de liberation in tho selection of persons a^ members of the convention to draft a con stltution for the Incoming state, and 1 earnestly advise that such constitutior after adoption by the convention shall bi submitted to the ieople of the tcrriiorj for their approval at an election in which the sole issue shall be the merits of tlic proposed constitution, and if the consti tution Is defeated by popular vote meant shall be provided in the enabling act for ii new convention and the drafting of a new constitution. I think it vital that the is sue as to the merits of the constitutior should not be mixed up with Ihe seh ctioi of state officers, and that no election ol state officers should be had until aftei the constitution has been fully approved and finally settled upon. Conservation of Resources. In several departments there is presente0 the necessity for legislation looking to the further conservation of our national re sources, nnd the subject is one of sin li importance as to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can be en tered upon In this communication. I'oi that reason 1 shall fake an early opportu nity to send a special message to congress on the subject of the Improvement of oui waterways, upon the reclamation and irri gation of arid, semi-arid, and swami. lands upon the preservation of our for ests and the reforesting of suitable areas, upon the reclassification of the public do main with a view of separating from agri cultural settlement mineral, coal and phosphate lands and sites belonging to tin government bordering on streams suitable for the utilization of water power. Consolidation of Bureaus. I request congressional authority to en able the secretary of commerce and la bor to unite the bureaus of manufac tures and statistics. This was recom mended by a competent committee ap pointed In the previous administration for the purpose of suggesting changes in the interest of economy and efficiency, and is requested by the secretary. White Stave Trade. I greatly regret to have to say that the investigations made In the bureau of immigration and other sources of Infor mation lead to the view that there is urgent necessity for additional legislation and greater executive activity to sup press the -ruiting of the ranks of pros titutes from the streams of immigration into ibis country—an evil which, for want of a better name, has been called "tin white ave trade." I believe it to l» constitutional to forbid, under a the transportation of persons fot purposes of prostitution across national and stale lines and by appropriating fund of $50,0011 to be used by the secre tary of commerce and labor for the em ployment of special Inspectors it will hi possible to bring those responsible for this trade to indictment and conviction under a federal law. I have thus. In a message compressed as much as the subjects will permit, re ferred to many of the legislative need' of the country, with the exceptions ul ready noted. Speaking generally, tin country is in a high state uf prosperity There Is every reason to believe that are on the eve of a substantial busbies expansion, and we have just garnered harvest unexampled in the market vaiui of our agricultural products. The high prices which such products bring meai groat prosperity for the farming com munity, but on the other hand they mean a very considerably increased bur den upon those classes in the community whose yearly compensation does not ex pand with the improvements in business and the general prosperity. Various ren-' sons are given for the high prices. Tin pronortl-.t.n te increase in the output gold, which today is the chief mediun of exchange and is in some respects measure or value, furnishes a substan tial explanation of at least part of tin increase in juices. The increase in pop I ulation and the more expensive mode living of the people, which have not beei accompanied by a proportionate increa« in acreage production, may furnish a fur thur reason. It is well to note that th increase in the cost of living is not con fined to this country, but prevai's tin world over, and that those who *wou'. charge increases in prices to the exlstin protective tariff must meet the fact thj. the rise in prices has taken place almo^ wholly in those products of the factor and farm in respect to which there ha been either no Increase In the tariff in many Instances a very conslderabi reduction. One difference between a pugilist am a champion football team is that th latter makes most of its noise at th close of the contest. If there was really room enough the top there wouldn't be so man people falling off. BIG
