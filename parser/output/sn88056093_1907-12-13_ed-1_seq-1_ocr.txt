He was arrested the charge of forgery; his hearing on took place in Justice Chamberlin's court, and he was bound over to the district court in $500 bonds which he could not furnish.

Lewis' Employes Get Judg ment for Wages. On Thursday of last week the cases of Win. McMann et al, versus the B. R. Lewis Lumber company and Joe Mirovich versus the B, R. Lewis Lumber company, in which the plaintiffs brought suit to recover their wages, alleged to be due them, were tried before Probate Judge Mc Call. The plaintiffs won both cases, the entire amounts sued for being $500 each. These men were employed at camp No. 1 of the B. R. Lewis Lumber company, and claimed they were offered time checks due on April 10 in lieu of their wages, which they declined to accept. They mainta.ned they could not afford to wait until spring for their pay and refused the time checks, they claimed, because they could not get face value, some times as little as per cent being offered. They claimed nothing was said about waiting for tbeir money until later, or April 10. The company alleged the men had to wait until April 10 for their money. Some of the men had been employed for 40 days or more. This case is important, as it settles the time check proposition unless it is specifically agreed upon at the time the men are employed by the company.

WILL HAVE TO WAIT Matter Now Rests With Judge Woods to Surrender Adams. It is understood that after the present term of court in Bonner county is concluded, Judge W. W. Woods will hold a special term here for Kootenai county, to act upon the request for an order authorizing that Steve Adams, still in the county jail here, be turned over to the Colorado au thorities to be taken to Telluride to stand trial for the alleged mur der of Arthur Collins, former manager of the Smuggler-Union mine. The special term in Rath drum must be advertised for two weeks, and it is expected it will be held the latter part of this month. About the middle of last week Sheriff Chas. A. Fitzpatrick of San Miguel county, Colo., arrived in Boise with requisition papers from Governor Henry Buchtel of Colo rado. Walter Hanson, prosecut ing attorney of Shoshone county, had notified Governor Gooding that he would turn Steve Adams over to the Colorado authorities if they would permit Adams' return to Idaho after the courts of Colo rado were through with him. Upon this assurance Governor Gooding honored the requisition papers and promptly issued extra I dition papers to the Colorado ; sheriff who immediately started for Rathdrum to get the prisoner, arriving here on the 5 o'clock train last Friday evening. Sheriff C. A. McDonald of Koot I enai county, in whose custody Steve Adams has been since his I case was transferred here from I Shoshone county, had not received I authoiity from the district court to hand Adams over to Sheriff Fitz patrick. Sheriff Bailey and Attor ney Hanson were at Sandpoint to make request for the order to Judge Woods, and word from them was awaited until 9 o'clock, order was issued they were ex pected to arrive in Rathdrum with it on No. 3 ; but at 9 o'clock Sher iff McDonald received the tele phone message from Bailey announcing that the order would not be made that night. It was awaited on Saturday but again failed to come. Then it developed that Judge Woods felt convinced that he had no power to make an order releasing Adams from this district unless while holding court in Kootenai county, and in this position the matter now rests. Steve Adams appeared in good spirits last Friday night and seemed to have no objections to going to Colorado. Wourms of Wallace, and D. C, Coates of the same city, the former attorney of Adams' were present and assured Sheriff Fitzpatrick that no legal obstructions would be made to hinder his return to Colorado with Adams after the necessary order is issued by Judge Woods, and that no habeas corpus proceedings will he undertaken. in lows: 000 vcved dary in Coeur for to act; ers tion of in If the John H. for an H.

TROOPS AT GOLDFIELD 1 Mine Owners Resolve to Reopen the Mines. As a result of alleged lawlessness incident to the strike situation at Goldfield, Nev., Governor Sparks called for United States troops, and five companies of the 25th infantry were sent from San F r ancisco and are now camped at Goldfield teady to quell any disturbance that may arise. Upon the arrival of the troops, the mine owners announced their deter mination to reopen the mines which were rapidly filling with water and being damaged by cavelns. On Monday the Goldfield Mineown ers' association adopted resolutions to reopen the mines Thursday, (yester day) morning; offering a wage scale reducing the pay of miuers from $5 to $4 per day, and all other workers in proportion; and demanding that the stores of Goldfle'd reduce the cost of living 20 per cent, or the association will open company stores and boarding houses guaranteeing that reduction tc their employes. The resolutions bar out all members of the Goldfield union of the Western Federation of Miners, bqt offer preference to all former employes who will accept their terms.

S1CNS IF HURRY the the by the Currency Law Not Looked For Before Spring. Washington, D. C., Dec. 5.—The large Republican majorities In both houses of the Sixtieth Congress, which opened at noon on Monday, give promise of a business-like session which will be noted chiefly tor Its conservative tone. Financial legisla tion will command the most atten tion on the part of the leaders In both houses and they express confidence in the expectation that some measure will be inscribed on the statute books before final adjournment. While there were many hearty greetings, numerous cordial congrat ulations and introductions of new Senators, It was noticeable that In almost every instance some refer ence to the death of Senators Morgan and Pettus or some expression of re gret for the absence of Senator Spooner gave a sober turn to the conversation, and there was lesB laughing and joking than is usual at the openiug of a Congress, aud dary in 690 777 est The President's annual message Is considered to be, on the whole, a dignified, comprehensive view of the nation's affairs. The President's a recommendations generally on gov ernmental matters are In harmony with his well-known views, and he urges upou the people to remember that the material condition of the country is Inherently sound and that the great mass of the country's busi ness is conducted with honesty. Nothing that Mr. Roosevelt has ad vanced has earned more respect for | his statesmanship than his work for the conservation and development of the country's natural resources which sutiject he discusses in a masterly fashion iu this massage and points the way to national wealth by the !

The consensus of oploloo among , of leading Senatorsand Representatives is that there is absolutely no need for emergency legislation because witbin the next thirty days there will be a greater amount of money than the banks can conveniently handle. It is the belief that a contraction of business will occur all along the line, not serious but quite sufficient to re lease a considerable portion borrowed capital now employed and the result will be that the bank re serves will grow rapidlv. The lead ers in Congress Insist that Unsocial legislation is too important a subject to be dealt with hurriedly and the intimation is that no measure will be $30 on resi enacted before spring.
