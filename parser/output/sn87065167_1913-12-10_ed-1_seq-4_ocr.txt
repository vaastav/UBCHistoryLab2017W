One was j his declaration for immediate action in regard to rural credits; the other! was his positive stand in favor of presidential primaries and the abolition of national conventions. The message was a masterpiece all the way through, both in logic and construction, but these were the only two in stances where his words were surprising. Everyone knew his position on Huerta and Mexico, though his expressions regarding the dictator were per haps stronger than any of his previous statement»; everyone knew he would advocate a seamen's bill, an employers' liability act; government ownership of Alaskan railways, and the other matters touched on in his message. And everyone knew, for that nlhtter, that he would advocate a rural credits system; the surprise lies in the fact that he makes it the very next step In his big legislative program. It was generally supposed that anti trust legislation would be the next big step after the currency bill has been passed, and that a comprehensive conservation measure would follow the anti-trust bill. Then, the political forecasters had it, the President might turn his attention toward rural credits. But Mr. Wilson evidently has a higher opinion of agriculture and of the government's duties to the farmers, than have most of his political fore casters. He places an act for their especial benefit ahead of trusts and ahead of conservation. Those who reasoned that the damage done by the trusts as a result of over-legislation In the states is greater than the dam age done to farmers as a result of under-legislation in congress, do not share the views of the President. He has put the farmer first In his con sideration; and when he approves and congress passes an act establishing reasonable credit for the agricultural classes of the country, he will have performed a truly great service for the greatest of all producers, the farmer. The President's declaration in favor of direct presidential nomiantions is decidedly the sensational feature of his message—which has come to be a message no longer, but an address. The idea is not original with Mr. Wilson. It has ben suggested by a great many legislators from Roosevelt on up. But the trouble with all previous suggestions has been that they failed to provide a suitable method of writing a platform; and It has been argued that to nominate directly and leave the platform to be written by the same crudely organized body that has heretofore been performing both duties, would be curing only half the evil. Ftesident Wilson has offered a suggestion that Is complete In Its scope. He would have the people nomlante their candidates by dtreet ballot and have the nomination confirmed and the platform written by the congression al and senatorial nominees of the party of which the nominee is a candidate. Of course the platform cannot be written by direct vote, but the Wilson plan provides that It be written by people who are directly responsible for their official life to the people who elected them, Instead of by a gathering of men on whom rests no future responsibility whatever. The News approves every suggestion In the approve the two suggestions which occasioned the greatest surprise. They may be termed radical. They certainly were called all kinds of radical when Bryan first proposed them. But they are not foolish radicalism. They are not direct and thorough. It was a great message and the country will be better off when Congress has carried into law all the suggestions it tains—and Congress will. message.

Jackson, Miss., Dec. 10.—J.

After pleas by Mr. Cassidy who represents the defendants, District At torney Thames, in forceful language and by a specific presentation of statu tory and legal documentary evidence, showed that the sheriff of the county has the legal right to Impanel a grand Jury when in the opinion of the court the one selected by the legal method of procedure is deemed unfit to con sider the specific cases that may be brought In for consideration. During the afternoon session ef the court Judge Pat Hepry, who is leading the forces for the defense, by bringing numerous specific instances to the at tention of the court, claimed that the indictment returned by the grand jury was void, In view of the fact that same was not representative of the many sections, voting and otherwise, of the county, and that the work of the sher iff In the selection of same was with out legal significance and that it was the duty of the court to return a ver dict of not guilty and thus free Messrs. Bilbo and Hobbs of ail connection with wrong-doing. Puts Defense to Rout. Judge H. C. Mounger, presiding at . . ...... ! ^ sensatlonal trla1 ' after givlng the ' losest attention to the facts as pre ^"ted, highly complimented the at '«rneys by saying: I ''I am of the opinion that it will I never again be my good fortune to j hear such learned expressions of legal i propositions or Bee a more forceful j array of correlated facts and specific j instances and correctly chosen records that I have seen and heard presented in this case." Judge Mounger puts the defense to rout by adding: "However, it Is the opinion of the court that the sheriff has acted in ac cordance with the requirements of statutory and common law in selec tion of the grand jury, and the de mands of the defendants are overruled and the case will be heard as per docket." . I Numerous and sundry clamors and j suggestions of what could have been ! or should be done were at once put in ! motion, but Judge Mounger announced that the Tucker murder trial was set ! ! for hearing and that same was to next ! [ receive attention. I It is the current assertion of public j and private conversations that the de I fense should bring their clients to trial if they are innocent, and the state would thus be given an opportunity to know of the exact conditions and the people will be relieved of the obliga tion of expending the large sums that such a trial will of necessity incur. The trial has brought legions of visi tors from the rural districts and from many parts of the state. All seem to feel that Bilbo is the whole case and that any time that he la seen in the court-room or on the streets he is al- ! ways indexed as the real attraction 1 in the game of legal procedure that is j ~-.-ig contested in the Warren county, court. Strange as it may seem, there I is little or no partisanship being ! shown by those in attendance. The'that current expression of opinion is: "If ; he is guilty, I hope that he gets all that can be administered to a guilty high official, and if he is innocent I want a chance to vote for him for the next governor of the state." Very few people are of the opinion that Messrs, Bilbo or Hobbs could fail to receive a fair and impartial trial in the court of Warren county. May Ask Venu« Change. While the defense has scrupulously refrained from printing a program of the methods of proving the innocence of their clients and by what manner of legal form they intend to extricate them from the colls of the present In dictments, leaky places in their bonds of secrecy have told the public some things that may be changed when ne cessity presents an obligation. It is said that when the demurrer is overruled that a motion for a change of venue will be made and that in an effort to prove the certainty of the feeling of the people of the county the entire voting strength of the various districts will be put on the stand. While this would be one of the most effective dilatory methods conceivable, it is felt sure that the court would limit the sphere of such activities to numerical certainties. When the change of venue is declared overruled by the presiding court authority, a further motion for a continuance will occupy the attention of the attorneys for the defense. It ts probable that such a continuance will be granted and that same will be so covered by limitations that a day of the present term of court will see the accused of ficiais brought before the bar of jus tice. ■ j Tedious Work Ahead.
