But all these peace projects, even the most ; modest, such as that suggested by j Bcheidemann, all agree upon one point, colossal Increase of German power through robbery, and in con- nectlen therewith the- leadership of I Germany over the other powers. ' This is the peace, the rotten peace. to which the Entente powers are in vited " . , This peace stgnlfies nothing but an endless period of everlatsing wars, a I period of renewed competition in arm ; amenta, that will destroy the last rem j cant of the spiritual and moral force ; of Europe. ' Far more than the 'foes of Germany I has the German . people to dread such i & petMSi For the German people it 1 would be the last reactionary stroke, the wretched autocracy of the Junker and the war maker. For decades to come the German people would have ' to live a sad life shorn of freedom under the rod of the military camaril : la, the state, of siege, the dungeon. f and the bodily condition of slavls to j the chimneypot and cabbage lords of 1 Prussia.

Whoever still retains sentiment for the freedom of peoples and the honor of men, who sees in humanity some t:iing move than a herd of cattle which d aserves to be mastered by the stick of the Prussian corporal, that man would rather anything, even the erash i of civilisation 1 tee if, to this Prusslan ; German Krapire of the world. A Prua ! skmised earth would mean the end of ! all that makes life worth living. The Allies must keep on with the war, for they will not submit- to the yoke of a brutal Junker caste, of. a fanatical ' military horde, devoid of righteousness and human feeling. j The war makers will use this farce j of peace to fan the "righteous wrath" i of the German people against other ; peoples; they wish to exploit for their i own purposes of war the war-weari-i ness of the German people and its ; longios tor peace.

Stratford, Dec. 10 An assistant fire chief was appointed and a -few rules, concerning Stratford Firs Depart ment, No. 1, of which Allen D. Jud- son is chief, were formulated and unanimously passed by the selectmen at a meeting held by them at the town hall. George Hattersley, presi- dent of the Nichols avenue fire de- partment, was appointed assistant ! chief. Mr. Hattersley is well known about town and has been affiliated With the Nichols avenue volunteer fire fighters for a number of years. . As regards the rules for fire head is n salary attached to his new posi quarters laid down by the town fath ers, political dopesters about the town are in a quandary. Some are of the opinion that Chief -Allen D. Jud son has been remiss In his duty while others say that it is for betterment of the department. It was voted at the meeting hat Clerk Harold C. Lovell write Chief Judson that under no consideration In case of fire at night shall he leave the engine house without the night crew for both chemicals. The chief was also instructed to break in ten men who belong to the company and demonstrate to them how to run both cars, also ' Instruction as to how to make hydrant connections and handle chemical tanks. About two months ago the select men purchased two nicxie plated Py rene extinguishers for the Nichols avenue fire house. Somehow that company never, received them and notified the selectmen. An Investi gation by that body revealed the fact that the extinguishers were still in possession of Fire Co. No. 1. . The result was that Chief Judson was or dered to take the Pyrenes from his car and deliver them to the Nichols avenue department and put the two brass Pyrene extinguishers lying loosely around the fire house, on his car. ' ' Present at the meeting were First Selectman James Lally and Selectman Fred W. Nettleton, and Clerk Harold C. Lovell. Selectman John J. Wil liams was unable to attend on ac count of Illness.
