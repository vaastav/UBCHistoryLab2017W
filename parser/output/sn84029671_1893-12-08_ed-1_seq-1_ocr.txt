TO COXGKESa The President Sends In Els Regular December Message. Work And Recommendations Appertaining to the Department Necessity of Re. treDchmen t Treasury Condi Uob and Tariff Chances. Washington, Dec 4. The president's message to congress was not so long as expected. The Hawaiian matter Was not extensively referred to, advices being awaited. The views of the presi dent on foreign and domestic affairs are as follows: Message to the congress of the United States: The constitutional duty which requires the president from time to time to give to the con Rresa information of the state of the anion and recommend to their consideration such meas ure as he shall Judge necessary and expedient, la fittingly entered upon by commending to the congress a careful examination of the detailed statement and well supported recommenda tion contained in the report of the beads of departments who are chiefly oharged with the executive work of the government In an ef fort to abridge this communication as much is consistent with its purpose, I shall supplement a brief reference to the contents of these departmental reports by the mention of such executive business and Incidents as are not embraced there and by such recommendations as appear to be at this particular time appro priate. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been entirely free from perplexity no embarrassing situation remains that will not yield to the spirit of fair ness and love of Justice, which joined with con sistent fairness characterizes a truly American foreign policy. Foreign Affairs. My predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator ot the long standing bound ary disputes, tendered to toe president by the Argentine republic! and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned by those states to lay be fore me evidence and arguments In behalf of their respective government The outbreak ot domestic! hostilities In the republlo of Brazil found th United States alert to watch the interest of our citizens in that country with which we carry on Important commerce Sev eral vessels of our new navy are now, and for some time have been stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle being between the es tablished government, which controls the machinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly relations and certain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as it does, the elements ot divided administration, I have failed to see that the Insurgents can reasonably claim recognition as belllgcrants. This far the position of our gov ernment bos been that of an attentive but an Impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict In passing.our fixed policy of Impartial neutral ity In such a condition of affairs as now exists, 1 deem it necessary to disallow In a manner not to be misunderstood, tbe unau thorized action of our late naval commander In those waters in sal-ting the revolutionist Bra zilian admiral, being Indisposed to countenanoe an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to the local Insurrection The convention between our government and Chili, having for its objeot the settlement and adju tment of the de mands of the two count tes against each other has been made effective by the organiza tion of the claims commission provided for. The two governments failing to agree upon tbe third member of thi commission the good offices of the president of the Swiss republlo were Invoked, as provided In the treaty, and the selection of tbe Swiss repre sentative to this country was gratifying alike to the United States and Chill and the vexa tious question of so-called legation asvlum for offenders against the state and its laws was presented anew in Chill by tbe unauthorized action of the late United States minister in receiving into bis official residence two persons who had just failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pend ng, growing out of a former abortive disturbance, and the doctrine of asylum as applied to this case is not sanctioned bv the best .precedents, and, when allowed, tend to encourage sedition and strife Under no oircumstances can the representative of this government be per mitted under the Ill-defined fiction of extra-territorial jurisdiction to attempt the administra tion of criminal just ce in the countries to which they are accredited A temperate de mand havin? been made by the Chilian govern ment for the correction of this conduct in the Instance mentioned, the minister wai instruct ed no longer to harbor the offenders. The legislation of last year known as the Oeary law, requiring the registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence In the United States and the deportation of all not comply ing with the provisions of the act within the time prescribed, met with much opposition from Chinamen In this country. Acting upon the advice ot eminent counsel that the law was unconstitutional, the great mass ot the Chinese laborers, pending Judicial inquiry as to Its va lidity, in good faith declined to apply for the certificates required by Its provisions. A test case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was brought before the supreme court and on May 15, b9X a decision was made by that tribunal sustaining tbe law. It is believed that under the recent amend ment of the act extending the time ot regis tra . tton. the Chinese laborers thereto entitled, who desire to reside in this country will now avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus af forded ot establishing by lawful procedure their right to remain and that thereby the ne cessity of enforced deportation may be to a great degree avoided It Is devolved upon the United States min ister at Pekia as dean of the diplomatic body and in the absence of a representative of Sweden and Norway to press upon the Chinese government reparation for the recent murder of Swedish mtssionaires at Ton?, but this ques tion is of vital interest to all countries whose citizens engage in missionary work in the ln . terior ' Our relations with the French republlo con tinue to be intimate and cordial. I sincerely hope that the extra iltion treaty with that country, as amended by the senate, will soon be opera tl' e. While occasional questions affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the land of their birth have arisen in our inter course with Germany our relations with that co ntry continue satisfactory. The questions effecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit ot friendliness. Ne otlations are in progress be tween the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the Behring ea tribu al of arbitration practicallv effective, and it is not doubted that Great Britain will co-operate freely with this country for the ac complishment of that purpose. The dispute growing out of the discrimination tolls imposed in the Welland canal . upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States, was adjusted by the substitution of a more equitable sched ule ot charges and my predecessor thereupon suspends bis proclamation imposing uiscrimt nating tolls upon British transit th ough our canal. A cqjestfor additions to the list ot extraditable offenses covered by the existing treaty between the two countries is under con sideration. During the past year an American citi zen employed in a subordinate commercial position in Hayti. after suffering a pro tracts) imprisonment on an unfounded charge of smug gling was finally liberated on Judicial examina tion. Upon receiving authentic Information of the firing upon an American mail steam r touching a the port of Amapalpa because her captain re used to deliver up a passenger In transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala Hn demand of the military authorities of Honduras, our nun' lstsr to that count' y. under lnatruolona. pro tested against the van ton sot sad demanded Mustaetioa. m tovernmw ot txouavna, the utmost friendship, promptly sjsavowed the 111 conduct of its offlo- ra The extradition treaty with Bujeia signed in March 1S87 and amended and contt-mnd hr ma senate In February last was dulji proclaimed last June. 1 It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our ratl ns with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment Just prior to the installation of the pres ent administration the existing govern ment of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between the provisional government ot the Island and the United Ststes and submitted to the senate for ratification. This treaty I with drew tor examination ana dispatched Hon. James A. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commission to make an impartial In vestigation of the oircumstances attending the change of government and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination Mr. Blount submitted to me his report showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representatives to that g vernment and through the intimidation caused by the pres ence of an armed naval force of the United Sea tea which was landed for that purpose at the instance ot our minister. Upon the tacts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by tbose representing us and to restore as tar as prac ticable the status existing at the time of our forcible Intervention. With a view ot accom plishing this result within the constitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities grow ing out of any ohange of conditions, brought about our unjustifiable interference our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instructions to that end. Thus ar no Information of the accomplishment of any definite result has been received from him Additional advices are soon expected. When received they will promptly be sent to congress together with all other information at hand, accompanied by a special executive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to com plete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all material, events leading up to the present situation. Tbe Treasury. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 8 J, 1833, amounted to H61.71tii5Gl.9t and Its expenditures to $159,374,674.29. There was collected from customs 196,835.019.73 and from Internal reve nue $101,057,821 9a . Our dutiable Imports amounted to l21 854711. an increase of )2,453, 9u7 over the preceding year, and importations free ot duty amounting to 414,544,211. a de crease from the preceding year of tl3.4,447. Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding year by $7,147,4.S2- Tbe total tax collected on distilled spirits was 94,7f 800. S5; on manufactured tobacco, $31,889,711.74, and on fermented liquors, 32, &48,98S.07. We exported merchandise during tne year amounting to f8!7,64M9l, a decrease of 182,012,924 from the preceding year. Tbe amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year in tbe history of the government, amounting to 1 1 08.68.1,844, and exceeding the amount exported during the preceding year by $68,483,517. The sum paid from the treasury for sugar bounty was $3,37.,13i.8i an Increase over tbe preceding year of $.',03 1, OSS 09. It is estimated upon tbe basis ot present revenue laws that the receipts of the gove- n ment for the year ending June 3), 1894, will be $43 ',131,865. x$ and Its expenditures $158 121, 865.38, resulting In a deficiency of 2V00,iOa On the 1st day of November, 199 J, the amount of money of all kinds in circulation or not in cluded In treasury holdings was 1, 718,544. C82, an increase for the year of $112,434,947. Esti mating our population at 67,435,000 at the time mentioned, the per capita circulation was $ JX49. On the same date there was In the treasury gold bullion amounting to $9t),657,?73, and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of tlitt,- 26I.5S& The purchase of silver under the law of. July 14. I89:i, during the last fiscal year, azgregated B4.0i8.162.59 fine ounces, which cost $15,541, S74.cS. Tbe total amount of sliver purchased from tbe time that law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause on the 1st day of November, 1893, was 104,674. 59). 45 fine ounces, which cost $155,930,940 84. Between the 1st day of March, U93, a .d the 1st day of November, 1893, the government purchased un der all laws 533,008,717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of $516,62,918. The silver dollars that have been coined under the act of July 14, 189), num ber 3o087,28x The seigniorage arising from such coinage was $C97,0u9.& 89, leaving on hand In the mints 149,699,781 fine ounces, of silver which cost tli6,7o8,3ia Our total coinage ot all metals during the last fiscal year consisted of 997,230.8:5 pieces valued at m 68), 174 S.). of whl h there was $3), 033,14 In gold coin, $S13,7I5 in silver dollars, $7,317,22.1.90 In subsidiary sliver coin and $1,08 ,. 103. 90 In minor coins. During the calendar year 193 the production of precious metals in the United States was estimated to be 1.95 yi;5 fine ounces of gold of ths commercial and coinage value of )0,000,'i o and 58,000,0)0 fine ounces of silver ot the bullion or market value of $50,750, 000 and of tbe coinage value of 174,94), 90 ). It is estimated that on the first day of July If 81 the metallic stock of money in the Waited States, consisting of coin and bullion amounted to $l,18.559,ie9 of which $397,697,685 was gold and :615,861.484 was silver. One hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the year ending October 81, 1893, with a capital ot $11,230,000, forty-six went Into voluntary liquidation and 158 sus pended. Sixty-five of the suspended banks were insolvent, eighty-six resumed business. and seven remain in the hands of bank ex aminers with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the new banks organized 44 were located In the eastern states 41 west ot the Mississippi river and 34 in tbe central and southern states The total number of banks in existence on the 31st day of October. 189.t, was 3,793, having an aggregate capital of i695,55',12a The net in crease in the circulation of these banks during the year was i3i.e83.872. The recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by tbe Government as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency af fair I do tot doubt that the ul imate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impos Bible to know at this time precisely what condi tions will be brought about by the change, or what, It any, supplementary legislation may in the light of such conditions, appear to be es sential or expedi nt Of course, after the re cent financial perturbation tim - is necessary for tbe re-establishment of business confidence. When, however, through this restored confl dmce, the money which has been frightened Into hoarding laces is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation ' probably disclose a site path leading to a permanently sound currency abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our In creasing population and business. In the pur suit ot this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and tempo rar.- ex pedients, determined to be contented with nothing less than a lasting and com prehensive financial plan. In these cir cumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay In dealing with tbe su jwt, instead of being Injurious, will Increase the probability of wise action. I desire to earnestly suggest the wisdom amending the existing statutes in r gard to the Issuance of government bonds. Tbe authority now vested in the secretary of the treasury to issue bonds Is not as clear as it should be and the bonds authorized are dlsad- vantazcoos to the gov rnm n both as to the time of maturi and rate of Interest The superintendent ot imm gratlon through the secretary of the treasury report that dur ing the 1 st fiscal year there arrived at our ports '.T91 immigrants. Of these 1W63 were not permitted to land urder the limitations of tbe law and 577 were e turned to the countries from which they came by teas n of their having become public charge . The total arrivals were 14I.U34 less than for the previous year. Department of Justice. The report of the attorney-general contains the usual summary of the asairs ana proceed ini of th department of Justice for the past year, together 'Itu certain teeoajmfclaiisai as a naeaea tmuoa oa vinous surcecis. ItWMt ton nwttir tofiorsy tip propwia that the fee system as applicable to the com pensation of United States attorney, marshals, clerks ot federal courts and United States com missioners should be abolished with as little delay as possible It is clearly in the interest of the communlt7 that the business of the courts both civil and criminal shall be as small and as inexpensively conducted as the ends of justice will allow. The system Is, therefore, thoroughly vicious wblch makes the compensation ot court offi cials depend upon the volnme of such business and thus create a conflict between a proper ex ecution of the law and private gain, which can not fail to be dangerous to the rights and free dom of the citizen an i an Irresistible tempta tion to the unjustified expenditure of public funds. If In addition to this reform another was inaugurated which would give to United states commissioners the final disposition ot petty offenses within the grade of m sdemean ors, especially those coming under the Internal revenue laws, a great advance would be made toward a more decent administration of the criminal law. In my first message to congress dated Decem ber 8,1885, 1 strongly recommended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the evils of the present system. Since that time the crim inal business of the federal courts and the ex panse attending it have enormously Increased. The number of criminal prosecutions pending in tbe circuit and district courts of the United States on the 1st day of July, 1485, was 3,8)8, of which 1,881 were for violations of the internal revenue laws, while the number of such prose cutions pending on the 1st day of July, 1893, was 9,500 in which 4,230 were for violations ot the Internal revenue law The expense of the United States courts exclusive of judges salar ies for the year ending July 1, 188), was $2,874,- 73a 11 and for the year ending July, 1S93, $1,528, 676.87. It is, therefore, apparent that the reasons given in 1:85 for a change In the manner of enforcing the federal criminal laws have gained cogeney and strength by lapse of time. I also heartily join the attorney-gen ral in recommending legislation fixing decrees of murder within federal Jurisdiction, as has been done in many of th st ites, authorizing writ of error on behalf of the government in cases where final judgment is r nde ed against the sufficiency of an Indictment or aga nst tbe government on any other question arising be fo e actual trial: limiting the right of review in case of felony p nlsbable only by fine and Im prisonment to the circuit court of appeals, and making speedy p- o isioa for the construction of such prison - and reformatories as may be necessary for the confinement of United States convicts. Post Office Department. The report ot the postmaster-general con tains a detailed statement of the operations ot the post office department during tbe last fis cal year and much information touching this important branch ot the public service. The business of tbe mails indioite with absolute certainty the condition ot the business of the country, and depressions in financial affairs in evitably and quickly reduces tbe postal reve nue Therefore a larger discrepancy than usual between the post office receipts and ex penditures is tbe expected and unavoidable re sult of the depressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of tbe time covered by the postmaster-general's report At a date wnen better times were anticipated It was estimated by his predecessor that tbe deficiency on ths 30 th dav of June, 1893, would be but a little over $1,530,030. It amounted. however, to more than $,009,030. At the same time and under the influence of like anticipa tion estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1891, which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of $372, 245.71, but now in view of the aotual receipts and expenditures during that part of tbe cur rent fiscal year already expired tbe present postmaster-general est ma'es that at its close Instead of a surplus there will be a deficiency of nearly $3,000,000. The post office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $7j,808,933.1S and its expenditures to 181,074,104 9a This post office deficiency would disappear or be immensely decreased if less matter were carried free through the mails, an item of which is upward of three hundred tons of seeds and grain from the agricultural department. The total number of post offices in the United States on tbe 8)th day of June, 1893, was 63,404, an Increase of 1,384 over the preceding year, and cf these 3,: 6) were presidential, an increase In that class ot 234 over the preceding forty-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing. making a total ot 003, and ten cities and towns provided with free delivery on June 8), 1893, ninety-three other cities and towns are now entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been accorded them on account of in sufficient funds to meet the expense of its es tablishment. I am decidedly of the opinion that tbe provisions of the present law permits as general Introduction of this feature of matl service as is necessary and justifiable, and that it ought not to be extended to smaller com munities than ara now designated. The expense of free delivery for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1E91, will be more than $ll,"00,uu0 and under the administration now existing th;re must be a constant increase In the item of expenditures. There were 6,4 1 ad ditions to the domestic money order offices during the last fiscal year, being the largest In crease fn any year since the inauguration of the system. The total number of these offices at the close of the year was 18,434. There were 14,309,735 money orders issued from these of fices, being an Increase over the preceding year of 1,240,293, and the value of these orders amounted to $137,576,433. 6 an Increase of $7,- 509,63258. There were also issued during the year postal notes amounting to 112,903,0767a During ths year 19) International tnon v or der offices were added to tbose a ready pro vided, making a to al ot 2.407 in operation on June :0, 1893. The number of international mo ey orders issued during the year was 1,055,- 99 J, an increase over the precdlng year of 72, 525. and the value was 416 341.837 86, an increase of $1,221,506.31. The number of orders paid was 300,917, an increase over the proceeding year of 13,503, and their value was $V 383,375, an In crease f $94091.83 From the foreg ing state ments It appears that the total issue of money ord rs and postal n tes for the .ear a mourned to$156,X21.348.21 The number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special delivery was 3,375, 69a an increase over the preceding year of nearly 22 per cent The special delivery stamp used upon these letters and packages amounted to $337,569 30 and tbe messengers' fees paid for their delivery amounted to 1216,59 .'.71, leaving a profit to the government of 9 976 59. The rail way mail service not only adds to the prompt ness of mail delivery at all offices, but it is the especial instrumentality wblch puts the smaller and way places In the service on an equality in that regard with the larger and terminal offices. This branch of the postal service his, there fore, received much attention from the post master general, and though it is gratifying to know that it Is in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness. I am led to agree with tbe postmaster-general that there is room for Its further Improvement There are now con nected with the post office establishment 28,321 employe who are in tbe classified service, and the head of this great depart rent gives con clusive evidence of the value of civil service reform when, after an experience that renders his judgment absolutely reliable, he expresses the opinion that without the benefit of - this system it would be impossible to conduct the vast business Intrusted to him. Tbe Interior Department. The secretary ot the interior has the super vision of so many important subjects that his reports are of special value and interest On the 30 h day of June. 183, there were on the pension rolls 936.012 names, an Increase ot 83. 94 over the number on the rolls June SO, 1893. Of these there were seventeen widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, the sur vivors of the war of 1811, MS widow of soldiers of that cer, Z1.M8 survivors and widow ot the Mexican war, 1,882 survivors and widows of In dian wars. 284 army nurses and 475,81 surviv ors and widows and children of deceased sol diers and sailo s of the war of the rebellion. The latter number represents those pensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting Ir-m army and nav service. - Tbe ausiber of persons remaining on the rolls Juie 30, lfaa ho are pension-id under the act of Vune 37. 1890, which, allows pensions on ae- cc .Jit cf death and disability lot ehargawa to tuair service was 44.1 a the BBmher added to ths rolls during ths Ttsn ww 133,41 fi4 ttt ftvttor Arc?? vh $3,680. The first payments on pensions allowed during tbe year amounted to 433, 7i 6, 549. 98. This includes arrears on the accumulation be tween the time from which the allowance of present dates and the time of actually granting tbe certificates, although the law of I89J per mits pensions for disability not related to mili tary service, yet as a requisite to Its benefits a disability must exist incapacitating applicant "from the performance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support" Execution of this law in Its early stages does not seem to have been In accord with It true inten Ion. but toward the close of the last ad ministration an authoritative construction was given to the statute snd since that time this construction has been followed. T Is had the effect ot limiting the operation ot the law to its intended purposes The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and glgantlo frauds, the commissioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete examination, giving notice to the pensioners, in order that they might have an opportunity to establish, if possible, the justice of their claims notwithstanding apparent invalidity. This, I understand, is the practice which has for a long t me prevailed in the pension bureau, but after entering upon these recent investiga tions the commissioner modified this rule so as not to allow, until after a complete examina tion, interference with the payment of a pension not altogether void, but which merely had been fixed at a rate higher than that au thorized by law. I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension office shonld not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. t very name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiment in which pen sions have their origin. Every fraudu lent pensioner has become a bad citizen: affidavits to support of a pension have made perjury more ommcn, and false and undeserv ing pensions rob the people not only of their money but of the patrlotio sentiment which the survivors of a war fought for tee p eserva tlon of the union ought to Inspire Thousands of neighborhoods have their well known fraudu lent pensioners, and recent developments by the bureau establish appalling conspiracies to establish pension frauds. Bt no means the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, wh ought not to be condemned to such associations. Those who attempt, in the line of duty, to rectify these misdoings should not be accused of enmity or indifference td the claims of honest Veterans. The sum expended on account of pensions, for tbe year ending June 30, liti, was $156,740,467. 14. Tbe commission estimates that $165,000, OK) will be required to pay pensions during the year ending June 30, 1894. . O r Indians number about 248,000. Most of them are located on 161 reser-ations containing 86,116,521 acres f :and. About 110,000 of these Indians have to a large degree adopted civilized customs Lands in severalty hav been all tted to many t them. Such allotments have been made to 10,000 individuals during tbe .ast fiscal year, embracing about 1,030,000 acre The number of Indian government schools open during the year was 195. an lno ease of 12 over the preceding year. Of this total 170 were on reservations, ot which 73 were boarding schools and 67 were day schools. Twenty boarding schools and five day schools supported by the government were no- located on reservations. Tbe total number of Indian children enrolled during the year as attendants oi ail scnoois waszi.i3n an increase oi i,3i over the enrollment for the previous year. I am sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching mast bo important fac tors in any effort to save, the Irdian and lead him to civilization. I believe, too, that the re linquishment of tribal relations and the holding of land In severalty may. in favorable condi tions, aid this consummation It seems to me, however, that allotments ot land In severalty ought to be made wit h great care and circum spection. The appropriations on account of the Indian bureau lor the year ending June 3, lb91, amount to $795,4983 93 a decrease as compared with tbe year preceding it of $187, 131.9V The vast area of land which but a short time ago constituted the public domain is rapidly falling into private hand It is certain that in the transfer the beneficent Intention of the government to supply from its domain homes to the industrious and worthy home seekers is often frustrated. Though the speculator who stands with extortionate purpose between the land office and those who, with tbeir families, are Invited by the government to settle on the publio lands, is a despicable character who ought not to be tolerated, yet it is difficult to thwart his scheme. The recent opening to settlemen of the lands in the Cherokee outlet, embracing an area of 6,500,000 acres, notwithstanding the utmost care In framing the regulations governing the selec tion of locations and notwithstanding the pres ence of United States troops, furnished an ex hibition, though, perhaps In a modified degree, of the mad scramble, the violence and the fraudulent occupation which have accompanied previous openings of publio lands. I concur with the secretary in the belief that these out rageous incidents cannot be entirely prevented without a cbange in tbe laws on the subject, and I hope the recommendations in that direc tion will be favorably considered. Department of Agriculture. The report of tbe secretary of agriculture will be found exceedingly Interesting, especial ly to that large part of of our citizens inti mately concerned in agricultural occupations. On the 9th day of March, 189a there were upon it pay rolls 2,430 employes. This number has been reduced to 1,800 person In view of a depleted publio treasury and the Imperative demand of the people for the economy in the adminis tration of tbeir government, the secretary has entered upon the task ot rationally reducing ex penditures by eliminating from the pay rolls all personsfl not needed for an efficient con duct of the affairs of the department During the first quarter of the present year ths ex penses of the department aggregated 1315,876.76 against $102,912.12 for tbe corresponding period of the fiscal year ended June 3, l?9a The sec retary makes apparent his intention of continu ing this rate of reduction by submitting esti mates for the next fiscal year less by 1991,380 than those for the present year. Among the heads of divisions in this depart ment the changes have been exceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring from death and resignations have been filled by the promotion of assistants in the same divisions. These pro motions of experienced and faithful assistants have not only been in tbe interest of efficient work, but have suggested to those in the de partment who look for retention and promotion that merit and devotion to duty are their best reliance. The amount appropriated for the bu reau of animal industry for the current fiscal year is $850,000, the estimate for the ensuing year is 170J.0KI The regulations of 1893 concerning Texss fever have been enforced during the last year. and the large stock yards ot the country have been kept free from Infection. Occasional 1 - cal outbreaks have been largely such as could have b en effectually guarded against by the owners of the affected cattle. While contagious pleuro pneumonia in cattle has been eradicated animal tuberculosis, a dis ease widespread and more dangerous to human life than pleuro-pneumonia. Is still prevalent Investigations have been made during the past year as to tie means of Its communication and the method of Its correct diagnosis. Much prrgress has been made In this direction by the studies of the division of animal pathol ogy, but work ought to be extended in co operation with local authorities, until the dan ger to human life arising from this cause is re duced to a minimum. The number of animals arriving from Canada during the year and inspected by bureau officer was 463,093, and the number from trans- Atlantic countries was 1,297. No contagious diseases were found among the Imported animal The total number of inspections of cattle for ex port during the past fiscal year was 611.543. The exports show a falling off of about t per cent, from the preceding v ear, the decrease occurring entirely in the last half of tbe year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to an increase in tbe price of Amer ican export cattle. Durin; tbe year ended J me ), 1S93. export ot inspected pork aggre gated 23,677.410 pounds as against $8,152,871 pcunds for the preceding year. The falling off in this export is not cossnea, however, to in spected pork, the total quantity xcartedtor ISM being 95.49x$l pound.!, whjje (d lf4 t I Join the secretary in recommending that hereafter each applicant for the position of in spector or assistant inspector in the bureau ot animal industry be required as a condition pre cedent to his appointment to exhibit to the United States civil service commissioner his diploma from an established regular and repu table veterinary college, and that this be sup plemented by such an examination in veterin ary science as the commission may prescribe The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ended June So, 1892, attained the enormous figure of 4830,000,040 in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent ot our total export In the last fiscal year tvis aggregate was greatly reduced, but; nev rt el as, reached $615.-103,000, being 75. 1 per cent of all American commodities exported A review ot our agri cultural exports ith special refere. ce to tbeir ces instlon will show that in almost every line tbe United Kingdom ot Great Britain and Ire land absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle the total exports aggregated in value tor the fiscal year ended June SO, 1:9 1, $36,009,0 of which Great Britain took considerably over $2VD),003. Of beef products ot all kinds our total exports were $X,OU0.030, of which Great Britain took $!4,0',030. Of pork products the total exports were $3 000,' 00, of which Great Brl lain took $,00000. In breadBtuffs, cotton and minor products, like proportions sent to the same destination are shown. The work of the statistical division of the department of agriculture deals with all that relates to the economics of farming. The main purpose of its monthly reports are to keep the farmers Informed as fully as possible of all matters having any Influence upon the world's markets in which their products found sale. Its publications relate especially to the commercial side of farming. It is therefore of profound Importance and vital concern to the farmers of the United States who represent nearly one-ha f of our population, and also of direct Interest to the whole country, that the work of this division be efficiently performed and that the Informa tion it has gathered be promptly diffused. It is a matter for congratulation to know that the secretary will not spare any effor to make this part of his work thoroughly useful. In tbe year 1839 tbe congress appropriated $1,000 to be taken from tbe patent office funds tor the purpose of collecting and dis tributing rare and improved variet es of seeds and for prosecuting agri cultural investigations and procuring agri cultural statistics, and from this small beginning the seed division ot tbe department of agricult ure has grown to its present unwieldy and un justifiably extravagant proportion During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $16,548 6L The remainder ot an appropriation of $135,030 was expended in put ting them up and distributing them. It sure y never could have ente ed t e minds of those who first sanctioned appropria tions of publio money for the pur chase of new and improved varieties of seeds for distribution that from this wouid grow large appropriations for the purchase and distribution by members of congress of or dinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings whi h are com mon In all the states and territories and every where easily obtainable at low price In each state and territory an agricultural experiment station has been established. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds; and yet this Indiscrim inate and wasteful distribution by legislation and legislators contlnues.answerin? no purpose unless it be to remind constituents that their representatives are willing to remember them with gratuitous seeds at publio cost Under the -anction of existing legislation there was sent out from the agricultural de partment during the last fiscal year eiough of cabbage seed to plant 19,30) acres of land, a sufficient quantity of beans to plant 4,000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2,506 acre sweet com enough y plant 7,800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,025 acres wl h vines and enough muskmelon and watemelon seeds to plant 2,075 acre The total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus distributed was contained in more than nine million packages and tbey were sufficient if planted to cover 89, 593 acres of land. In view of these faots this enormous expendi ture without legitimate returns of benefit ought to be abolished. Anticipating a com munication so mantles ily in the Interest of good legislation more than $100,030 has been stricken from the estimate made to cover this object tor the year ending June 30, 1895, and the secretary recommends that tbe remaining $35,003 of estimate be confined strictly to tbe purchase of new and Improved varieties of seed and that these be distributed through ex periment station Thus tbe seed will be tested and after the test has been completed by the experiment station tbe propagation of the useful varieties and the rejection of the valueless may safely be left to the common sense of the people War Department. The secretary of war reports that the strength of the army on the ith day of Sep tember last was 2), 778 enlisted men and 2. 144 officer The total expenditures of the depart ment for the year ending June 3 ), 183a amount ing to $51 ,934,078. 89. Of this sum $1 ,993, .81 i was for salaries and contingent expense! $33,377,- 838.33 for the support ot tbe military establish ment, $1,077,033.18 for miscellaneous objacts and 420.518,631.41 for public work. This latter sum lncluds (13,293,876.48 for river and harbor Improvements and 43,398,111 3 for fortifica tions and other works of defense. The total enrollment ot the militia of the sev eral states was, on the 81st of October of the .current year, 113,597 officers and enlisted men. The officers of the army do tailed for the in spection and instruction of this reserve of our military force report that Increased Interest and marked progress are apparent in the dis cipline and efficiency of the organization Neither Indian outbreaks or domestic vio lence have called the army into service during the year, and the only active military duty re quired of it has been in the department of Texas, where violations of the neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with by the troops, elicit ing tbe warm approval of the civil and mill tar ' authorities ot both countries. Tbe operation of wise laws and the influence of civilization constantly tending to relieve the country from the dangers of Indian hostilities, together with the increasing ability of the states through the efficiency of the national guard organization to protect their citizens from domes tio violence, lead to the suggestion that the time Is fast approaehing when there should be a reorganization of our army on the lines of the present necessities of the country. This change contemplates neither increase in number nor added expense, but a redistribution of the force and an encouragement of measures tending to greater efficiency among the men and Improvement of the service. After mnch preliminary work and examina tion in accordance with the requirements of th law. the board appointed to select a magazine rifle ot modern type with orders to replace the obsolete Springfield rifle of the Infantry serv ice, completed its labors during the last year and the work of manufacturing is now in prog ress at the national armory at Springfield. It is confidently expected that by the end cf the current year our lnf ntry wl 1 be supplied with a weapon equal to that of the most progressive armies ot tne world The work of the projected Chickamauga and Chattanooga national military park has been prosecuted with zeal and judgment The reports of the military academy at West Point and the special schools for special in struction ot officers show marked advance In the education of tbe army and a commendable ambition among It officers to excel in the military profession and to fit themselves for the blghes t service to the country. Tbe Navy. The report of the secretary of tbe navy tains a history of the operations of his depart meat during th past year and exhibits a most gratifying conoltlon of th personnel of our navy. Be present a satisfactory account to congress which has been made in the construc tion ot vessel and makes a number of recom mendations which is e-peel ally invited. During the past six months the demrod for arming vessels have been manv and urgent. There hive been revolutions calling for vessels to protect American Interests in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cota Bica. Honduras. Argeatipe nd.

There have been delays In the completion of unarm ored vessels, but for tbe most part they have been such as was constantly occurring even In countries having the largest experience la naval ship building. The most serious delays, how ever, hve been in the work upon armored ship. The trouble has been the failure ot con tractors to deliver a rmor as agreed. The diffi culties seem now. however, to have been all overcome and arrair is being delivered with satisfactory promptness The method ot employing mechanical labor at navy vards through boards of labor, an! making efficiency the sole test by which labor ers are employed and continued, is producing the best results, and the secretary is earnestly devoting himself to Its development Attention Is invited to the statements of bis report ta re gard to workings o: tbe system The Civil Service. The continued Intelligent execution of the civil service law and 'ho Increasing approval by the people of its operation are most qualifying. Tbe recent extension of its limitations and regula tions to the emp ores at free delivery post offices which has been honestly and promptly accomplished by the commission, with the heart.- co-operation of tbe postmaster-general, is an Immensely important advance ta the use fulness of ihi s .-stem. I am. If possible! more than ever convinced of tbe Incalculable benefits conferred by the civil service law, not only in Its effect u; on the public service, but also what is even more important in its effect in elevating the tone of political life generally. The law embodying civil s rvlce reform found its wsy to our statute book more from fear ot the popular sentiment existing in its fa vor than from any love for the reform itself on the part of legislators, and It has lived and grown and flourished in spite of the covert as well as open hostility spoilsmen and notwithstanding the querulous impracticability of m ny self-constituted guardian B netth all the va arles an sublimated theories Wblch re attracted to It there underlies this reform a sturdy, com mon sense principle not only suited oto this mundane sphere, but whose application our people are more and more recognizing to be ab solutely essential to the most successful opera tions of their government, II not to its per petuity. It seems to me to be entirely Inconsistent with the charaoter of this reform as well as ith Its best enforcement, to oblige the com mission to rely for clerloal assistance upon clerks detailed from othe - departments. There ought not to be such condition in aay department that clerks hired to do work there can be spared to habitually work at another place, snd it does not aceord with a sensible view cf civil servio - reform that persons should be employed on the theory that their labor Is necessary in one department when in point of fact their services are devot-d to entirely dif ferent work in another department I- earn estly urge that tbe clerks neoes ry to carry on the work of the commission be rogularly put upon its roster, snd that the system of oblig ing tbe commissioners to rel - upon the service of clerks belonging to other department be discontinued. This ought not to lnorease the expense to the government, while it would certainly be more consistent and adds greatly to the efficiency of ths commission. Economy in a public expend iture is a duty that cannot Innocently be ne glected by those intrusted with the control of money drawn from tbe people for publio use It must be confessed that our apparently end less resource the familiarity of our people with immense accumulations of wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the ex penditure of public money should in some man ner be to their immediate and personal advan tage, the indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a larger part ot our taxes are exacted, and a degenerated sense ot official accountabil ity have led to growing extravagance in gov ernmental appropriation Tariff Reform. After a hard struggle, tariff reform is di rectly before us. Nothing so important claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents Itself as both an opportunity and a duty an opportunity to deserve the gratitude ot our fel low itlzens and a duty lmpos-.d upon us by our oft repeated professions and by tbe emphatlo mandate of the people After full disousslon our countrymen have spoken In favor of this reform. ane they have oonflded tbe work of Its accom plishment to tbe hands of those who are sol emnly pledged to it If there is anything in the theory of a representation in publio places of the people and their desires, if publio officer' are really servants of the people and if political promise and professions have anv binding force our failure to give the relief so lo g awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing sbould intervene to distract our attention or disturb our effort un til this reform is accomplished bv wise snd careful legislation While - e should staun hly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation and that they should be llmite by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that condi tions have grown up among us which in jus tl e and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our government actually demand. Manlfestly.lf we are to aid tbe people directly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should be a reduction in present tariff charges upon tbe necessaries of life The ben efits of such a reduction would be palpable and substantially seen and felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and bet ter sheltered. These gifts should be the willing benefactions of a government wbose highest function is the promotion of the welfare of tbe people Not less closely related to our people's prosperity and well being is the removal ot re strictions npon tbe importation or tbe raw ma terials necessary o our manufacture Tbe world sbould be open to our national Ingenuity and enterprise. For tbeir goods soon fill the narro market to which they are confined. Then folio s suspension of work In mills and factories, a discharge of employes and distress In tbe homes of our workingmen. Even If the often disproved assertion could be made good that a j lower rate of ages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the intelligence ot our workingmn leads them quickly to dis cover th-t their steady employment permitted by free raw mite rials 1 the Important factor in their re stlon to tariff eglalatloa a measure has been prepared by the appropri ate congressional committee embodrlng tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly submitted for legislative action. It is tbe result of much patriotic and unselfish work ani I believe it deals with its subject consistently and si thoroughly as ex isting conditions permit I am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provide 1 for in tbe proposed legislation, added to existing Internal revenue taxation will, in tbe near future, though perhaps not immediately, produce suf ficient revenue to meet the needs of the gov ernment The committee, after full consideration and to provide against a temporary deficiency which mav exist before tbe business of tbe country adjusts itself to the new tariff sched ules, have wisely embraced In their plan a few additional Internal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon Incomes derived from certain corporate investment These new assess ments are not only absolutely just and easily borne, but they have tbe further merit of being such as can be remitted without unfavorable business disturbance whenever the necessit of their imposition no longer exist. In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain th suggestion that Its success can only be attained by means of unselfish counsel of tbe part of the friends of tariff reform snd as a result of their willingness to subordinate personal desires snd ambition to the general good of the local Interests affect ed by the proposed reform ar. so numerous and so varied that It all are insisted upon the legis lation embodying ths reform must inevitably fail. In conclusion my Intense feeling of responsi bility Impels me to invoke for the manifold in terests ot a generous and oonfldlog psopl the most scrupulous nr and o p-edg my willing support to every legislative effort for the 4 vaaoement rf tb greatness sod prosperity of I TUT 

PUBLICS SCHOOLS. An Address of the National League for tbe Protection of American Institutions. New York. Deo, 5. The National Leatrue for the Protection of American Institution has issued the following1 address to the public in defense of the American common School system: Tbe practice of nations In the support ot schools where the union of church and state prevails furnishes no precedent for the United State. We are not locking- to monarchies for instruction concerning the best training ot youth to fit them for citizenship In this republic Popular suffrage here rests for its safe exercise upoa the character and intelligence of all classes of the people. The republic for Its own preserva tion has established and must insist upon main taining a tree common school system of educa tion. It must be maintained without compro mise. It is the only institution capable of coo- verting the dangerous heterogeneous clement . of our population Into a safe homogeneous citi zenship. The tax for the maintenance of public schools, levied upon all citizens whether they have chil dren t educate or not, is for tbe publio. good, and not for private benefit The state opens its . scho Is with equal advantages to the children of all its citizen - Its laws make no distinction as to ths creed of the individual in the ctaolce of its teachers. In New York state no compul sory law exist, requiring the attendance of children upon the common schools ot the state. The state does not deny the right of parents, orgaaizatlons or churches to establish and maintain private or parochial schools tneir own expense A movement, however, with audacious com mands and specious claims bas been inttiatea in New York state for tbe division of the pub-, llo school funds on sectarian lines, and it Is announced the same programme 1 proposed for all tbe state That It bas mainly in view selfish and not pub- ends Is shown by the ract mas the movement is being pushed al most exclusively by a single religious de nomination which for many years, by its chief authorities, has been assaulting tbe pub.lo' school system A few of its more liberal rep resentatives have tolerated the system and hsve sought in many ways to control it Every compromise, however, between sectarian and public schools whloh has previously been tnea has invariably resulted in the humiliating sur- - render ot some vital principle of publio school - education. It Is undoubtedly true that a majority of the citizens of even the denominations making these demands prefer the publio schools lor their children and patronize them when possij ble. It is unquestionably true that full proportion of tbe . teachers In these publio schools are attacnea to the church which by many of its officials an-, tagonizes this common school system We ap peal to all loyal American citizens to co operate in every possible way In the defense of the American free pubito scnooi system, on which the safety of tbe republic and tbe peace and prosperity of ths ettizecs so largely de pends.

WONDROUS FUTURE. Kx.san-to- rtoollttle's Fronhetlc Vision of the United Htates. Chicago, Deo. 6. Ex-Senator James R. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, lectured to a large audience at the People's insti tute on "The United States in the Light of Prophetic History." Taking the prophetic vision of King1 Aebuclxadnez zar of the great image composed of four parts, each of different minerals, ana de stroyed eventually by a bun stone, an representing great successive powers, he held that the United States was , this last power which the prophet had foreshown which would overcome and rule the whole earth to the end of time He drew a vivid picture of the rise and fall of the successive empires, beginning with the Assyrian, followed" by the Medo- Persian, the Grecian and the Roman sub-divided - later into the modern European king doms. He pointed out the- prog-, ress of the United States nntil it was now the wealthiest power on earth. "This prophet," he said, "could have meant no other form of govern ment than a republican government, and as the United States- has been the leader in the most popular form of gov ernment, she will eventually unite the whole world in one vast republic.". ALIEN CONTRACT LABOR.' : Decision Rendered Which Will Embarrass -Its Enforcement. Washington, Dec. 5. The United States court has rwadered an opinion which, while affirming the constitu tionality of the alien contract labor law, will embarrass to some extent the a practical enforcement of the law.
