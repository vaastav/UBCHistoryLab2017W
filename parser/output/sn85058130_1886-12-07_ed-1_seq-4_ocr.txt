matters which be calls the attention of Congress he l mai Kfsti deep thought and careful study and he treats them in a I manner which will excite the attention and command the respect of the able S and thoughtful men of the nation A thorough American spirit prevades the t me sag patriotism marking every nlerance in matters of our relations i with foreign powers He demands for American citizens abroad the respec Ull J siJertion due to cltiz ns cf the 1 great nation for which he speaks an a > f jr foreigners residing under the flag of the United States the protection demanded our hands as a

tho popular cry against the Chinese i He recognizes the fact lent the Mono 1 goiiane while oar present treaties with CLlna are in force have as good right S to resiuencc in this country as the na

too g many Americans wanted him to do I but has said plainly enough to be under stood by our sister republic that while I s the United States wants no row with Mexico this government cannot accede I to the outrageous assumptions of the Greasers in regard to their right to pun ish American citizens for offenses com mitted outside of Mexican jurisdiction And so on all through the message the irefident states the policy of this coun try to beand it is the true Ameri can policythat while according to all protection under our flag Ameri t can citizenship must respected every I where It is to be regretted that Mr Cleve land dings to the civil service heresy in j J spite of the trouble it has brought upon the country and In defiance of its re s0 d ci pudiation by all save a handful of po I

14 he would at least be silent on the ques tion and not strike the motel another I 4 blow His slubtorncss however has ii caused him to again defy the popular will which shouts heartily in favor of

denunciations of the Mor mons act no demagogic utterances In p reference to the Utah problem For h the first time in the history of this i generation we find no rot in the q message regarding affairs

and ou the 1st t day of December ISto the total amount of such coinage was 247131 540 Tne director of the mint reports that at the time of the passage of the act of 1S7S directing this coinage the intrinsic value of the dol lars thus coined was ninetyfour and oucfonrth cents each and that on the 31st day of July JSSG the price of silver leached the lowest ttagu over known so that the intrinsic or bullion price ot our standard silver dollar at that date was less than seventytwo cents The price of silver on the 30th of November cast was such a to make the dollars intrinsically worth seventyeight cents each These differences iu value of the coins represent the tiuctua Ions of the price of silver and they certainly do not indicate that compulsory coinage by the govern ment enhances the price of that com modity or secures uniformity In its status Every fair and legal effort has ben made bv the Treasury Depart ment to distribute this currency among the people The withdrawal 01 United Stales treasur notes of small denomi nations and the Issuing of small silver certificates have been resortedjto In the endeavor to accomplisn this result in obedience to the will and sentiment

of this compulsory agci and 1 again urge its suspension on ail the grounds contained in my former recommendation reinforccH by the significant increase of our gold expor tations during the last year I ap pears by the comparative statement herewith presented and for the further reasons that the more this currency is distributed among the people the greater becomes our duty to protect it from disaster that we have abundance for all our needs and that there seems but little propriety iu ouilding vaults to store such currency when the only pretense fur its coinage is the necessity of its use by the people as a circulating medium The great number of SUIt now pending In the United States courts for the southern district of New York growing1 out of the collection of customs revenue at the port of New York and the num ber of such suits that arc almost daily instituted are certainly worthy the attention of Congress These legal controversies based on conflicting news by importers and the

safe place of con finement all the adult males were sent thitnerand will be closely guarded as prisoners In the meantime the residue of the band who though still remaining upon the reservation were regarded as unsafe and suspected of furnishing aid to those on the war path had been removed to Fort beeJ Marion the women aud larger child ren of the hostiles were also taken there and arrangements

statement of the action needed to improve the same as should challenge the earnest attention of Congress The present navy of the United States aside from the ships in course uf construc tion consists of first fourteen single turreted monitors none of which re In commission nor at the present time serviceable The batteries of these ships are obsolete and they can only be relied upon as auxiliary ships in har bor defense and then alter such ai expenditure upon them as might be deemed Justifiable Second live fourthrate vessels of small tonnage only one of which was assigned as a war vessel ant all of which arc auxiliary merely Tnird twentyseven cruisingships three of which are built of Iron of small tonnage and twenty four of wood Of these wooden ves sels it is estimated by the chief con structor of the navy that only three will be serviceable beyond a period of six years at which time it may be said that of the present naval force nothing worthy the name will remain All the vessels heretofore authorized are under contract or in course of con struction except the armored ships the torpedo and dynamite boats and one cruiser As to the last of these the bids were in excess cf the limit fixed by Congress The production in the United States of armor and gun steel is a question which It seems necessary to settle at an early day i the armored war vessels are to be completed with those materials of home manufacture This ha been the subject of investigation by two boards and by two special committees of Congress within the last three cars The report of the gun foundry board In ISS of the board on fortifica tions made in January last and the reports of the select committee of the two house made at the last session of Congress b entirely exhausted the subject so far a piultmiuiary inves tigation is involvcdand in their recom mendations they arc substantially agreed In the event thct present in nation of the department for bids to furnish such of this material as Is now mtera authorized shall fall to induce domes tic manufacturers to undertake the large expenditures required to pre pare for this new manufacture and no other steps are taken by Con gress at its coming session the Secre tary contemplates with dissatisfaction the necessity of obtaining abroad the armors and the gun steel for the au thorized ships It would seem desir able that the wants of the army and cavy in this regard should be reason ably met anti that by uniting the con tracts such inducement might be of fered as would result In securing the securInJ domestication of these important

Invite the earnest attention of Congress to the same and due consideration of the re commendations therein contained In I this report submitted by this olllccr to the last session of Congress he strongly recommended the erection of penitentiary for the confinement of prisoners convicted and sentenced in the United States courts and here repeats his recomincnJatlou in ills re port for the last

stl atcd in every part of thu country They subjected to nearly asmanv triffe rent modes of treatment and discipline and are far too much removed from the contrl and regulation of the govern ment So fnr as they are entitled to humane treatment and opportunity for Improvement and reformation the government is responsible to them and society that these are forthcoming but this duty can scarcely be dis charged without more absolute con trol and discretion than ate possible under the present system Many of our good cituets have interested themselves with the most benefit ill re sults on the

practically done in the direction of this reform and t present an example In the treatment and im provement of Its prisoners worthy of imitation With the prisons under Its own control the Government could deal with the somewhat vexed ques tion of convict labor so far as its con victs are concerned according to a plan oUt own at its option and with a due regard to the rights and inter ests of our
