HE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN t Territorial Library, S16 ...-.a. SEVENTH YEAR. PHOENIX, ARIZONA, TUESDAY5 MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1896. VOL. VII. NO. 17L CONGRESS AGAIN AT WORK. The National Legislative Resumes Grinding. Mill Interesting Scenes and Incidents of the First Day's Proceedings . Crowds of Curious Spectators Swarm the Galaries. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 The Fifty fourth congress began today the short session which marks the closing months of its life. Unusual interest attached to the day's proceedings. Months had elapsed since the leading representatives of the different parties had met face to face, and in view of the fact that one of the most stupendous political contests in the history of the country had been waged meanwhile there was a general desire to see these men and observe their actions. As early as 10 o'clock Pennsylvania avenue in the vicinity of the capitol began to take on an air of animation which had been foreign to it for some time. A procession of people passed by the Peace monument and climbed the stairs leading to the western en trance to the great building on the hill. Better posted ones took the cable or electric cars and were landed on the plateau where but a few steps were necessary to be taken to bring them to the senate or house elevators. The weather was delightful, and the assemblage far in excess of the seat ing capacity of the galleries. Fully one thousand visitors were lined up in the corridors leading to the house galleries a half hour before the time set for the proceedings to begin. Although there was little probability of any of these gaining an entrance the crowd did not diminish perceptibly until after the adjournment. The door keepers had their hands full in keep ing back the struggling mass .of hu manity. On jthe senate side of the capitol the throng was almost as great The gallery doors were thrown open at 10 o'clock and the space was well filled by 11. . ' " The senate chamber has been greatly improved , during the recess. The un gainly settees have been replaced by opera chairs which are very comfort able. On the floor the chairs of the senators are of one pattern. In days gone by senators were permitted to ' gratify their individual taste in chairs, and the result was a collection that did not add to the beauty of the cham ber. When thi'aenators .began to as semble they found thenfeelTes the focus of a thousand or more pairs of eyes in the galleries above. There were hund reds of women among the Spectators, and they displayed the most intense interest. One by one the senators passed through the swinging doors leading from the cloak rooms and ex changed greetings. There were doz ens of floral tokens on as many desks, and each recipient displayed pardon able curiosity to ascertain the name of the . donor. It was plain to all ob servers that the sound money Repub licans were in better spirits than their Popocratic neighbors. They laughed and chatted with each other and ex changed congratulations on the out come of the election. The Democrats and silver Republicans were subdued, as a rule. Sound money Democrats like Brice of Ohio, Caffery of Louis iana and Vilas of Wisconsin, indicated by their actions that they were well satisfied with existing conditions. Jones of Arkansas looked conscious as he swung into the chamber. While the senators were shaking hands and indulging in the courtesies incident to the reassembling of the body the north door leading to the senators' lobby opened and the vice president entered. It was Mr. Steven son's 'first public appearance since the election. He, too, wore a subdued air. He shook hands with the blind chap lain, Milburn, and also greeted several of the senators who stood near. A minute or two before 12 o'clock he as cended to his seat and picked up the funny little handleless gavel which for years has been used by himself and his distinguished predecessors. As the clock indicated the hour of 12 Mr. Stevenson brought it down on the table before him with a sound which put an instant stop to the hum of conversa tion. The senators hurried to their desks and then all stood silent while the blind chaplain invoked the divine blessing. His prayer was short. The moment it ended the senate was its old time self again, ready for the fray. The roll call showed seventy sena tors to be present. Senator Cullom was the first to re ceive recognition. He offered a reso lution that the house be notified that the senate was in session and ready to proceed with business. It was agreed to. Senator Hale followed with a resolu tion that the daily hour for meeting be 12 meridian. This also was agreed to. Senator Sherman made the custom ary motion for a committee of sen ators and members to wait upon the president. Upon its adoption the pre siding officer named Mr. Sherman and Mr. Smith (Democrat) as the commit tee for the senate. Senator Morrill of Vermont (Rep.) presented several petitions asking for the passage of the Dingley bill. He yielded, however, to Mr. Hoar's sug gestion that all business be deferred as a matter of courtesy until the president and house of representatives had been communicated with. At 12:15 the house took a recess un til 1 o'clock. At 1 o'clock there was a further recess for thirty minutes, then another of fifteen minutes. At j 1:45 Senator Sherman reported that ! the president would communicate his views in writing. Assistant Secretary Pruden of the White House staff im mediately stepped forward with the message, which General Cox, secre- , tary of the senate, read. I The new Turkish minister, Mous- tapha Bey, accompanied by Secretary Norighi Effendi and attaches, entered. tne gauery snortly Delore the clerk read the president's words as to tjie prospective action to stop the Turkish indignities which had shocked the civ ilized world. They left immediately after this portion of the message was read. To many of the foreign represent atives occupying the diplomatic gal lery the message had special interest and significance owing to the part they had taken in conspicuous foreign events to which the president referred. Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British am bassador, remained throughout the short meeting. Senor Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish minister, was not in at tendance during the day, but two of the secretaries of the Spanish lega tion carefully noted the references to the Cuban conflict. Minister Hatch of Hawaii and Mr. Cooper, the Hawaiian minister of foreign affairs, were close listeners, although the message con tained no reference to the Hawaiian islands. The diplomatic gallery was vacated as soon as the foreign ques tions referred to in the message had been read. On the floor printed copies of the message were distributed and these gave the senators an opportunity to read the salient features. Secretary Cox is a poor reader and nobody made an attempt to listen to him. The sen ate adjourned soon after the reading of the message was finished. While the scenes attending the op ening of the house today were both brilliant and interesting, in the crowds that thronged the galleries and the conspicuous personages present, the proceedings themselves were dull and spiritless, being distinctively routine. Mr. Reed's appearance was the signal for applause. Some of the noted mem bers found flowers on their desks. The, Republicans were especially hap py. At 12 o'clock the chaplain invoked the divine blessing on the work of the session. Then the roll was called and committee consisting of Mr. Cannon of Illinois, Mr. Payne of New York, and Mr. Turner of Georgia, was appointed to wait upon the president. In due time this committee reported and the president's annual communication was read. The reading consumed about two hours. It was Mr. Cleveland's farewell message and there was curios ity as to his views, on Cuba especially but there was no demonstration, either of approval or dissent throughout its reading. The holiday nature of the day was saddened by the announcement of the death of ex-Speaker Crisp, which Mr. Turner of Georgia, formally made to his associates. Out of respect to the memory of the distinguished Georgian the house, after adopting appropriate resolutions, immediately adjourned, 

WHAT THEY THINK OF IT. Senatorial Expressions of Opinion of the President s Message. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 Comments in the senate on the message were gen erally favorable to the tenor of the message on the Cuban question inougn mere were some opposing views expressed. A large number of senators, including the majority of the members of the committee on foreign relations, excused themselves from expressing opinions on the ground that they had not given it careful reading. Mr. Mitchell, Republican of Oregon "The president seems to leave the Cuban situation as he finds it, refrain ing from any recommendation as to congressional action. His quasi-en dorsement of the existing tariff act will scarcely be acceptable to the Re publicans who believe in a protective policy." Mr. Pettigrew, Republican, South Dakota it is the first time in our history that an executive who is representative of a defeated party ever glorified, as Mr. Cleveland does in the first paragraph of his message. over the success at the polls of his party s opponents. Mr. Pritchard, Republican, North Carolina "The only noteworthy part of the message was that devoted to Cuba, and on that question it reminds me of the old rhyme, 'He wired in and wired out, and left the public still in doubt.' " Mr. Pugh, Democrat, Alabama "The message is sound on Cuba, sound on the tariff and especially sound on trusts and monopolies." Mr. Brice, Democrat, Ohio ''The president has handled the questions in as diplomatic a manner as possible." Mr. Nelson, Republican, Minnesota- "It is a fair statement so far as regard; Cuba." 

CLASSED AS; ANARCHISTS. Why Olney Declines to Recog nize the Insurgents. Incapable of Maintaining an Order ly Government and Sustaining Normal Relations Wltn Other Governments.. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 As bearing on the question of the recognition of the insurgents which is to come in some shape before congress, the fol lowing from Secretary Olney is of im- portance in explaining his reasons for declining recognition: "So far as our information shows, there is not only no effectual local government by the insurgents in the territory they overrun, but there is not even a tangible pretense to establish an administration anywhere. Their operations are confined to the shifting exigencies of the military operations of the hour, nomadic without definite centers, and lacking the most ele mentary features of municipal gov ernment. There nowhere appears a nucleus of statehood. The machinery for the executing of the legitimate rights and powers of sovereignty and responding to obligations which a de facto sovereignty entails in the face of the equal rights of other states, is conspicuously lacking. It is not pos sible to discern a homogeneous polit ical entity, possessing and exercising functions of administration and ca pable if left to itself of maintaining an orderly government in its own ter ritory and sustaining normal relations with the external family of govern ments." The secretary illustrates his point as to the irresponsibility of the insur gents by citing their destruction of American plantations and their op pression of the American planters who grind cane, which he characterizes as acts of anarchy. On the other hand he shows that in the capital cities and seaports of all parts of the island with which the United States or its citizens maintain legitimate intercourse, the Spanish power is supreme, though often exercised in a vexatious and ar bitrary way, calling forth just remon strance, and that most of the func tions of the government proceed as in times of peace. WILL STUDY IT FIRST. Bryan Not Yet Prepared to Criticise the Message. LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 7. When asked for an expression of opinion on President Cleveland's message, Wil liam Jennings Bryan said: 'Mr. Cleveland's message is too im portant a document either to be com mented upon in piecemeal or briefly as a whole. I do not care to express my self upon the message until -I shall have had an opportunity to carefully read and digest it." THE 

BOUNDARY QUESTION. The Venezuelan Government Accepts the Conditions Proposed. WASHINGTON, Dec. l. Secretary Olney received this morning a tele gram from Mr. Andrade at Caracas, which was in effect that the memo randum agreed upon between Great Britain and the United States for the settlement of the Venezuelan boundary question is accepted by the Venezuelan government, and that an extra session of the Venezuelan congress will be called as soon as possible in order that the memorandum may be carried into effect by a necessary treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela. DIDN'T SNUB 'EM. The Silver Republicans Have Been In vited to the Caucus. . WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 When the determination was reached to hold a Republican caucus tomorrow an in teresting situation at once presented itself. The silver Republican sen ators who bolted the St Louis plat form and the ticket were an unknown quantity in their political affiliations and whether or not to invite them to attend the Republican caucus was an undecided matter. It was finally con cluded that notices should be sent them as before. This result placed the burden of action on the silver Re publicans. There has been a tendency among some Republicans to pursue a conciliatory course toward the silver Republicans and especially as a num ber of them have declared in favor of protection. It is not believed that either Sen ators Pettigrew or Mantle or Cannon will attend the caucus, though they would not be required to indicate their views. The purpose of the caucus is to outline a programme for the session. TWO NEW "COPS.' The City Council Transacted Import ant Business Last Night. . . The matter of appointing additional policemen, which has been hanging fire for a long time, was settled last night by the city council at its regular monthly meeting. Mayor Monihon made a motion that Al Galpin and Will Buck, who have aone emcient wont lor the city as special officers for a long time, be ap pointed as the two extra policemen, at a salary of ?75 a month each. The motion carried. The selection is a good one, as the two young men have the material for making excellent po licemen. Officer Galpin will patrol the streets in the daytime, and Officer Buck will be assigned to night .duty. The regular police force now stands as follows: A. G. Clark, chief of police and city marshal; Steve Bailey, deputy marshal; Hi Hooker, jailer, and Al Galpin and Will Buck, patrolmen. The time for payment of city taxes was extended to December 16, at which time they will be delinquent.. A petition was read from property owners on First avenue and Jackson street for a light at the intersection of those thoroughfares. The petition was granted and the mayor was re quested to ask the Santa Fe Railroad company to place lights on all switches on Jackson street The contract of A. C. Frost & Co. for the sale of the proposed city bonds for $10,000 and $39,500 was submitted to the council and certain amendments thereto were agreed on.. On motion the amended contract was agreed to, the mayor to .sign and seal the same on approval of the city attorney. Several residents of Neahr's addi tion petitioned to have the grades of streets and alleys in that addition es tablished, as they wish to make cer tain improvements. The city engineer was ordered to establish the grades. ASH

Robinson of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railway com pany arrived in Phoenix Sunday even ing with a party, including his son, James Robinson, John Dupee, a Chi cago capitalist; M. H. Dupee and Gale Thompson of Chicago; B. B. Veach of Louisville, Ky. ; Henry Kings- ley of Boston, and President F. M, Murphy of the Santa Fe, Prescott & Phoenix Railroad company, who met them at Ash Fork and accompanied them to the citv. The party passed the day very pleasantly in viewing the points of interest around Phoenix. Mr. Robinson was asked last night by a Republican reporter if it was true that his trip had any connection with the report that his road might be ex tended to the coast. "There is absolutely no ground for such a report," he said. "My trip is one of business combined with pleas ure, but it has no bearing on an ex tension of the road. "Several months ago," continued Mr. Kobinson, I promised some friends that I would take them on a trip over the Santa Fe system. I am fulfilling that promise. "We were all greatly charmed with the part of the Salt River valley that we saw on our drive today. I am sat isfied that Phoenix and the valley have a splendid future." Mr. Robinson said that he would re turn to Phoenix next March to spend a few weeks. He will be accompanied by his family. The special car containing the party was switched to the M. & P. tracks last night and taken to Maricopa attached to the regular train.. The party will go to Los Angeles, thence back to St. Louis.

SILVER MARKET. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7. Silver bars, 65; Mexican dollars, 51 52. CLEVELAND'S LAST MESSAGE' It Is Devoid of Any Sensational Features. The President Devotes Considera ble Space to the Cuban Question., but Gives No Encouragement' t theJIngos. " . To the Congress of the United Statesr "As representative of the people' in . the legislative branch of their govern ment, you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence xJ our free constitution and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular "rule have been, again made manifest ?.A' political contest involving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension and creating aggressive ness so intense as to approach bitter ness and passion has been wagged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suffrage without disturbance of tout tranquility or the least sign of weak ness in our national structure. When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedi ence and manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of ."po litical opinions we discover " aband? ant evidence of a determination Ton the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will and to be controlled at all times by an' abiding faith in the agencies" estab1 lished for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitles them to de mand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious "ap preciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty In vites." - With this analysis of the recent election, President 'Cleveland begins his annual message to congress. The document comprises more than 20,000 words. It contains besides wealth of departmental information and statistics a succinct review of .the Cuban revolution without committing the United States government to 'am avowal of hostility eithej, against Hie sovereignty of Spain or ihe Cuban In surgents., . !':' President Cleveland begins that por tion of his message devoted to foreign affairs by referring congress to the re port of the secretary of state for all de tails in connection with minor matters. He then declares that -the disturbs! condition in Asiatic-Turkey has assum ed a less hideous and bloody aspect dur ing the past year, owing to the decis ive action on the part of the great na tions and the consequent awakefiins of the Turkish government to the de mand of human civilization. So fax as the United States government, "m concerned, it has. left undone nothing for the protection of Amrwan mise- sionaries and citizens in the Ottoman Empire. Continuing, tie president says: I do not believe the present sombre prospect in Turkey will be long per mitted to offend the sight ol Christen dom. It so mars the humane and enlightened civilization that bJonRS to the close of the nineteenth century, that it seems hardly possible that the earnest demand of good people throughout the Christian world for it corrective treatment will remain tra- answered." President Cleveland, in dealing "Wrtfc the Cuban situation, un&Jterably ex poses the recognition of the insurgente as belligerents. He believes the situ ation to be too delicate for any inter vention on the part of the United States at the present time, althorr? ( his message strongly hints that the es timate outcome may require an aggres sive stand on the part of this govern ment With greatest delicacy he de votes a large portion of his message te a review of the situation and points as a solution of the problem the offer te Cuba on the part of Spain, genuine autonomy. The insurrection, he de clares, still continues with all its per- plexities. No decision has been reached in the trial at arms. "If Spain has not yet re-established her author ity, neither have the insurgents ;yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent state. The pretext ' that civil government exists on the is land except so far as Spain is able to maintain it, has been practically aban-. dpned, but that exception being made the entire country is either given over to anarcy or is subject to a military occupation of one or other party. K is reported, indeed, on reliable author ity, that on the demand of the commander-in-chief of the insurgent apny, the putative Cuban government bas now given up all attempts to exercise its functions, leaving that government confessedly powerless, but there is the best reason for supposing it always to have been in fact a government merely on paper." President Cleveland is dinposed to acknowledge the superiority of the Spanish arms and of Cuban tactirs. He says, however, unless a speedy con test in the open is had, the policy "of the Spanish government not to In terfere with the destruction of proper-
