Island Station, McLean county, is said to bo the onlv Western Kentucky town which bars ne groes and not a single representa tive of the Ethiopian race is to be found there. Occasionally a col ored man, beating his way on a freight train, stops off for a few minutes, not knowing of the an tipathy. He soon "beats it.'! Even the colored porter on the passenger trains are shy about getting off at Island, and when they do it is only for a moment. Island is a town of 1,000 popula tion and is located on the Louis ville and Nashville railroad, in McLean county. H. Clay McKee & Sons Buy, Sell and Rent Real Estate, Loan Money, to or For You.

Short Courses in Agriculture. On the Secon'd day of January, 1912, the College of Agriculture of the State University will begin its farmers' courses or short courses in agriculture. The first week of this time will be desig nated Farmers' Week. The time will be consumed by the annual conventions of the various live stock breeders' associations, in cluding the dairy and beef cattle, swine, sheep and horse, the annual meeting of the State Horticultural Society and the Corn Growers' Association. Each of these as sociations will devote one day to their program, some of the con ventions running simultaneously in different rooms. This week affords the best pos sible opportunity, not only to hear an interesting and instructive program by practical and profes sional men of. State and nation wide reputation, but also an op portunitto meet a large majority of the iriost successful ftlrttlCrs and stockmen of our State. Not only will the farmer find the week spent at the college pleasant and profitable, but also his wife and daughter will find that special ar rangements have been made for them in the way of instruction in household economics. Lectures, demonstrations' and practical ex ercises in Cooking, sowing, home decoration and other matters per taining to the home will be treated. During Farmers' Week the State Corn Show will be held, with a large number of classes for both the adult and boys' depart ments, and a most attractive premium list is offered. At the same time there will bo held the State Dairy Show, with exhibits of milk and cream of both certi fied and market classes, and but ter made at the creamery and on the farm, each in its class. A separate premium list will be of fered for the various classes, mak ing it well worth while to com pete in any of them. The State Horticultural Society is also ar ranging for an elaborate exhibit. Special folders giving informa tion concerning each of these de partments will be mailed to any one on request. Reduced rates have been secured over all the railroad lines to put it within the means of a larger number to attend. Immediately following Farmers' Week will come the regular Win ter Short Course in Agriculture, intended for the practical farmer who cannot leave his farm to take any of the regular college courses. This course continues until the middle of March, treating practi cal farm problems and operations in a scientific manner The time was selected during the winter in order that it might be possible for the farmer to leave his work, which would not bo the case if the work were conducted in the sum mer.
