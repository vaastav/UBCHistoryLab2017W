The fact that a man from this town recently received a sentence to serve a term in the prison at Car son for selling whiskey to Indians does not seem to be heeded by others. That there is always some degenerate who stands ever ready to break the laws of the land in this respect and endanger, pos sibly, the lives of our citizens, is at tested to by tne fact that before Dalton, the self confessed culprit, had hardly become accostumed to h s prison garb, another of his kind lis stepped into the business of dispens ing whiskey to Indians in rpiantities unlimited. The officers succeeded in rounding the drunken warriors up and landed them in the place that cools, and creates a large thirst for stuff other i..a,i whiskey. If these Indians were given the opportunity of spending thirty days repairing the county roads for each offense, it reasonable to suppose aat we would see fewer drunken Indians. If not, we would "at least have better roads, which would at the least, be some satisfaction. Record-Courier. 0-0 THE WORM TURNS. Newspaper men don't seem to fare wed in politices.
