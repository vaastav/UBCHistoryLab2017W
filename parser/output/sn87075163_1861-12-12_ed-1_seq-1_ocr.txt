Since however, it is apparent that here as in every other State, foreijf 11 dang-rs necessarily attend domestic difficul ties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses on every side, while under this general recomme ndation provision for delending our coast-line readily occurs ti the mind. I also in the" same connection, ask the at tention of Congiess to our great lakes and rivers. It is beneved that some fortifications and depots of armsatnl munitions, with hur bor and nayigaiiurt improvements, at well selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the national ilclense anu pre servation. 1 ask attention td the views of tha Secretary of War, expressed in his re- port upon the Same general eubiect I deem It of imiibifurice that the lovnl re. gions ol east Tennessee anil Western North Carolino should be connected with Kentucky aim ouier imiuun parts 01 l ie Union. hv nil- road. I therefore recommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide lor the con strui tiotiof such a road as speedily as possi bid. Kentucky will 110 doubt co-onerntp and, Ihrouzh her legislature, make tbe most judicious adecijon of the line. The north ern terminus must connect With some exist- ing railroad, end whether the . route Shall be!

It is gratifyhig lo know that the patriot ism 01 me people is equal to theoccasion.and that the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which Congress authorised m to call into the field. 1 refer with pleas lire to those portions of his report which makes allusion to the credible degree ol dis cipline already attained by our troops and to the excellent Eauitary condition of tlie en tire army. The lecomthendation by the Secretary for in organiz.ition of the mililia upon a uni airm Dasis is an object of vital imnoriance V the luture safely of the country, and is lomintuaeu to 1110 serious attention ot ton- ress. A larse addition to the recular ormv. connection witn the (leleclitfr. that has fo considerably diminished the number ol Its onVefa, tlves peculiar importance to his recommendation fr i taoeis 10 ineereatesi eanac v ol ihe miliu. y acauemy. By mere omissiori, I presume. Coiiffrasa has fuiied to provide chaplains for tha hopi- aisoccupieu oy volunteers. This subject Jas oroiigiu to my notice, and 1 was in uced to draw dp the form of a letter, one upy ot which properly addressed to each ol the persons, and at the dates resnectivelv named,aud staled fn a Schedule containing also the lorm of the letter, marked '"aml herewith transmitted. These gentlemen, 1 understand, entered cpou the duties desig nated at the times respectively stated iu the sebedale.and have labored faithfully thete in ever since. I, therefore, recommended thit they be compensated at the same rate as chaplains in the army. I further suggest that general piovlsion be made for chap.ains to serve at hospitals as-well as with regiments. Tbe report of the Secretary of the Navy presents, iu detail, the operations of that branch of the sejvice, and the activity and energy which have characterized its admin istration, and the results of measures to increase its efficiency and power. Such bave been the additions by construction and purchase, that it may almost be said a navy has been created ami put into sorvico einco our difficulties commenced. Besidrs blockading our extensive Coast. squadron larger than ever before assem bled under our ilRg, bare jeen put afloat, and perlonned deeds, which have increased onr naval renown. 1 would invite special attention to the ' recommendation of the Secretary Of the Navy, lor a more perfect or gi Dilation of the Navy, by introducing ad ditional grades hi the', service.' The present orgatirzation is defective and mrailsl.i.i-IIniio lire TOMOll ansatistaciory; end the suggestions sobmit so lar forbwns makioj nominations to fill of in is at to of the and lor the is of these vacancies for reasons which I will now stale. Two out of the oulsoins Jndn. es resided within the States no overrun by revolt, so that, if successors were appointed in the same localities, they rould not serve upon their circuits, and many of the most competent men there probably would not take the personal hazaid of accepting to serve even here upon the Supreme Bench. lhave been unwilling to throw all the ap polntinents Northward, thus ilia-ibling my. self from doing justice to the South on the return of peace, although I may remark, that to translrr to the North one which has heretofore been in the Soulh, vrould not, wnn reierc-nce to territory ana population, be unjust. During the long sad brilliant Judicial car e?r of JudJe McLean his Circuit trtw Into an empire, altogether too large for any one Judge 'ogive the Courts therein more' than a nominal attendance, riniig in population from 1.470,000 in 1331, to 0.151,405 in I860. Besides this, the country Ims gener-1 ny outgrown our present judicial system If uniformity was at all intended, the sys tern requires that all the States shall be ac cominoduted with Circuit Courts, attended by buereino Ju .gee, while in la, t W.sron- sin. Minnesota, Iowa. Kansas, Florida. Tex- as, uaiiiornia and Oregon h'ivo never hud any such Courts. Nor can this bd well remedied without a chante of the svstem. becuu?e the adding of justices tu the Su preme Court enou-n for ihe accommodation of all parts of the country with Circuit Courts would create a Court altogether too dangerous lor a Judicial body of any sort, and ihe evil of it be one that will increase as near States come into the Union. Circuit Courts are useful or thev are not uselul. If useful no-Htate houl I bedenipd them. If not useful no Stale should have them. Let them be provided lor all nr abolished as to all. Three modifications occur to me here,, which I think would be an improvement upon our present system. j uei me nupreme i,ourt oe ot convenient number; in every event, then, first, let the whole country bo divided into circuits of convenient sizu, the Supreme Judues to serve iu a number of them, coaespouding to their own number, and independent circuit judg es be provided for all the rest; or, secondly, the Suptenie Judges be relieved fiorii circuit duties, and circuit judges provided lor all the circuits; or, thirdly, dispense with ihe cir cuit ccurts allogetlier. leaving the iudicial functions wholly to thfi district courts ami an Independent Supreme Court. 1 respectfully recommend to the consider. atiouof Congress the present condition of the statute laws, wtih the hope that Con- grvss will be able to find an eay remedy for me many iitcu.iveuiences and evils which cdi:stinily embarrass 'hose erlJiged in tbe practical administration of tliem. Since the organixation of the. Oovernmont, Congiess hps enacted some five thousand acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than six thousand closely printed mines mid are scatter-d tit rough many volumes. Miny these acts have been drawn in haste, and without sufficient caution, so that their pro vision. are olto.11 obscure in themselves, or conflict with each other, or at least so doubtlul as to render it very difficult for even the best informed persons to usceitain pre cisely what the ftaiute law really is. li seems lo me very important that the statute law should be made as pluin and in-tehi-ib.e es possible, and be reduced to as small a compass" as may consist with tho full ness and precision of the will of tho Legis lature, nnd ihe perspicuity of its liiguae. These, well done, would, I think, greally taciiiute the labors of those whose duty i"t to ussiet in the administration of thelaivs, and would be a lasting benefit to the peo ple by placing before ihem In a more sensi ble and intelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their du ties. I have been informed by some, whose opinions 1 respect, that all the acts of Con gress now in lorce and of a permanent and general uature might be revised and rewrit ten so as to be embraced in due volume or least two volumes of ordinary and con venient size, and I respectfully recommend Congress to consider the subject, and it my suggestion be approved, to devise such a plan as 10 their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment oT the end propo.-; ed. One ol tue uulavorable consequences' the present insurrection is the entire suppression in many places of all ordinary means of ailininiatering civil justice by the officers and in the fnrrn-i of existinnt law.

Some have estimated it as high as 200.000,000 dollnrs due in large part from insurgents in op-n rebellion to loyal citizens, who are even now makinu n,.,i sacrifices iu the discharge of their patriutic duty to support the Government. Under these circumstances, 1 have been rr,t,. solicited to establish, by military power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I hiive thus far duclin,i tfi ti it tint because I had any doubt that the end p'o pojed, the collection of the dht. urns itiof right in itself, but because I have been unwilling logo beyond ihe pressure of n. cessily in the unusual exercise of power but the powers ol Cotmiesj.

Is important that some more convenient irteins should" be provided, if possible, for adjustment of claims against lhe.Gov- ernmeut, especJalry. in view of their in-! ceased numbar by reason of the war.

The investi gation and adjudication of all claims In tneir nature belong to the Judicial Depart ment, besides it is apparent that the atten ttention of Congresa will be more than us ually engaged, for some time to come, with great national questions. 1( was Intended by the organization of the Court ol Claims mainly to remove this branch of busine.-a from the halls of Con gress, b it while the Court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of investi gation, it. in a greet degree, fails to effect the objeet of its creation for want of power to make its judgments final. Full awam of .the delicacy, not to say the danir nf the subject, I commend toyour careful consider ation whether this power of making judg monw final may not be properly given to the Court, reserving the right of appeal on ques tionsof law to the Sunreme Court, with such other provisions as experience may have shown to be necessary. I ask attention to the report of the Post master General, the following being a sum mary ftatement of the Department: The revenue from all son reel during, the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June. 1861. in. eluding the annual permanent appropfiatiori of 8700,000, for the transposition of free mail matter, was 89,019,298 40, being about two per cent, less than the revenue of 186IL The expenditures were 813 606,709 llj showing a decrease of more than eight per cent, as compared with those of the pfevi. ous year, and loavingan excesj of expendw tures over Ihe revenue for the last fiscal year of ovea $567,403 71. The gioss rev uue for the year ending June 30 1803, is es timated at an increase of four per cent, on that of 1861, making $8,633,000, to whicb should be added ihe earnings of the Depart ment for carrying free matter, vix: f700 000, mnkihor $9.383 .000. The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated It 812.5V8.O00. leav. ing an estimated deficiency of 63,345,009, be rupplied from the Treasury in addition the permanent appropriation. Tlie present inanrrection shoves, I think, that the oxtensiou of this Dis trict acfosa tlio Fotomac River, at tha timo of establishing the Capital here, was emineutly wise, and conscquentlj at the rulinijulshrueut of that por tion of it winch lies In the State o!

Tho depressing influerJces ot the In surrection have been especially lelt tho operations ot tho Patent and General Land Offices. The cash re ceipts from tho sales of public lands during the last year, have exceeded the expenses of our land system only about 200,000. The ' sales have been entirely suspended itithe South State3, while tho .interruptions to business of the country and the diversion of 'large numbers 01 men from labor to military service have obstructed settlements in (hrj new States and Territories of the North west. Ilio receipts of th Patent Office have declined in nine Months about $100,000, rendering a large re duction of the force employed neces sary to make it self sustaining. T'ae ueinaucs npon the renew?! Umco will largely increased by the insurrec tion. Numerous applications for pen sions, based upon the casualties of the existing war, have already been ma le. There is reason to beliove that many wln Rto now upon tho pension nil, and in leeeiptof the bounty of Cfiveniment, are in the ranks of insurgent army or giving them aid ana cotnlort. Hie beeretary of the Interior has directed the suspension tlie payment of tho pension of such persons upon pioof of their disloyal 1 recommend that Congress au thorize that officer to cause the names' such persons to be btricken from pension-rolls.
