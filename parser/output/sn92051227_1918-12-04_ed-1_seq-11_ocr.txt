London, Dec. 4 -President Wilson's address to the American Congress was extensively commented upon by this morning's newspapers which reiterate sentiments of hearty satisfaction that he is to attend the peace conference. They declare the President will And the Entente statesmen thoroughly in concurrence with his idealism and devotion to international Justice. There is manifest a strain of anxiety in the editorials with regard to recon ciling the President's principles as embodied in his 14 points with the as pirations of the Allies. The Morning Post, while paying tri bute in the warmest terms " to the President and to American co-operation In the war. Insists upon the im portance of the exact relation of the 14 points to the peace settlement be ing understood. It thinks the points were accepted too hastily by the Al lied governments. It relies, however. upon the President's definition of them as an outline of the basis of peace and regards them as "a service able instrument with which to begin the work of securing peace, every thing depending upon their interpre tation and' application. The Daily News asks anxiously for evidences of the acceptance of the spirit of the 14 points, the letter of which was accepted, with one exVp tion, by the Allies, and deplores "the ominous absence of any considered or worthy reference to the supreme Issue before the world." In the coalition government's appeal to the electorate of Great Britain. It accuses Lloyd-George of appealing to the mob instinct, talks of underground machinations to establish conscription in Great Britain and then asks if the omens are better in France and Italy. "In all the world," it inquires, "who are the statesmen who are backing not the letter but the spirit of Presl dent Wilson's policy? "The situation is full of menace. If it Is to be re deemed it must be by the peoples of every country." that the delay or other trouble is due to instructions issued by the Post Of fice Department, when such is not the case. According to instructions received from Postmaster General Burleson "The telegraph and telephone systems are operated for the benefit of the public, and the first duty is co-operation. Those who come in contact with the public must at all times be cour teous and obliging. Indifference of nonconcern in the relation with the service rendered will not be tolerated and must give way to a spirit of inter est rather than that of indifference in the performance of duty. Close at tention to duty and courteous treat ment involve no hardship and cost nothing, but mean much to the pub lic.

President's suite was piled high with telegrams and official documents be fore the transport sailed, and indica tions were that the President would plunge into this work even before the Georgo Washington got out to sea. Paria, Dec. 4 The Paris news- papers print the principal passages of President Wilson's message to Con gress, and special writers comment favorably. Julien Sorel, writing in the Oul, says: "If President Wilson's speech brings us no new information on interna' tional policy, it gives us suggestions which may serve the Allied govern ments in approaching the difficult questions of demobilization which none had foreseen." Rene Daral, in the Gaulois, refers to that part of the message dealing with the President's visit to Europe, and says: ish American war and men just re turned from overseas duty in the war of civilization.
