THE son of a leading manufacturer of Erussels, whose two brothers have been killed at the front, tells the following anecdote, which dates from the first summer of the wan " It had bean a hot day and king Albert, who had net left the trenches for hours, was suffering from thirst. He asked for something to drink, but not a soldier had anything left. Back of the trenches a man saw horse drinking and went over and started to pull the bucket away. 4M Don't do that,' said the king. 'Lt!the poor animal drink; perhaps it needs it more than I do.';-- ; " It was not until the' horse had finished drinking that the Jrin3 took up the backet and drank the few drops that remained."

EING GARAGE. ñ.1 TA 1 " Í CONGRESSIONAL i COMMITTEE BEGINS RAILWAY INQUIRY Proposed by President to Bet ter Condition of Carriers. MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM Official of Roads Prepared to Advocatt Federal Incorporation, Supervision of Securities and Extension of Authority of Interstate Commerce Commission. Washington, Nov. 20. Ten members of Congress, five Senators and five members of the House of Representa tives, began here today an inquiry into the subject of public control and su pervision of railroads that may lead to the revolutionizing of the whole scheme of governmental regulation of the coun try's transportation lines. Incidentally the committee is to look into the ques tion of Government ownershin of rail ways, telephone and telegraph lines and express companies. The members of the committee which will conduct this important in vestigation are Senator Newlands Of Nevada, chairman; Senators Robinson oNArkansas, Underwood of Alabama, Cummins of Iowa and Brandegce of Connecticut, and Representatives Ad- amson of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee, Cullop of Indiana, Esch of Wisconsin and Hamilton of Michigan. The in quiry was reeonimended by President Wilson in his message to Congress in December of last year. He described as its purpose to determine what could be done "for bettering the conditions under which the railroads are operated and for making them more useful serv ants of the country as a whole." Prominent Men as Witnesses. In order to obtain the views of all interests affected by the operations of the transportation Hups the committee has iuvited prominent shippers, bank ers, representatives of commercial or ganizations, railway executives, econo 'mists and others to appear before thera. The first to lie hoard are railroad commissioners of various states who began their evidence today. Their testimony Is -directed chiefly to oppos ing any enlargement of the federal authority over commerce that would detract from the powers now exercised by state bodies. They will lie followed shortly by ofticials of railway labor organizations who are expected to res istor their opposition to the increase of goj-ei-Hinental authority over wages and conditions of labor. Chief interest in the hearings cen tors in the proposals that will be put forward by representa) i ves of tne rail roads, for it is reported that they will advocate an extension of federal au thority over rates and securities to the practical exclusion of state control of those matters. It Is understood also that they will go on record in favor of fed eral incorporation of all railroad lines. Legislative. Program of Railroads. Krom an authoritative source is ob tained the following outline of the leg islative program which the railroads will ask the committee to consider In its investigation: They will endeavor to demonstrate to the commission that one of the principal defects in the pres ent system of railroad regulation is the lack of coordination resulting from the simultaneous and eonflictinii regu lation by the federal government and by the 4S states. They will, therefore, ask iimt entire governmental control of the rates and practices of Interstate carriers, except purely Jocal matters, bo placed in the hands of a federal body so. that interstate traffic may be regulated without reference to state lines, leaving to the state commissions jurisdiction only over local matters and local public utilities. As a part of this plan, a compulsory system of federal incorporation is to be recommended, accompanied by federal supervision of railroad stock and bond issues. - A reorganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission will be asked, In order to enable the commission prop erly to exercise its increased powers is also proposed that the preparation mm prosecution or cases against the railroads shall be delegated to some other agency of the government, possi bly the Department of ..-ístice, so that the commission may devote Its ener gies to its administrative functions. With (he commission thus relieved of some of Its present duties and equip, ped to handle its business more prompt ly, the railroads will urg that the pe riod during which the commission may now suspend proposed increases in rates be reduced from tc:i months to GO days, wltb provision fu:- reparation to be paid to the shippers if the ad vance shall be declared un" asonable. They will also ask that die commis sion be given the power to prescribe minimum as well as m.imum rates so that In meetings complaints of dis crimination the commission may order the advance of a rate which it consid ers -too low. ' One of the mos Important recom mendations for which ilia railroads will ask , favorable . consideration Is that the commission be specifically authorized to take int aceount in rate regulation the tlfct of, rates upon total earnings in the light of ex penses. While the Newlands Committee Is required, under the resVuíioucreat- ing it, to submit a repi n by January 2 next. itis not oiitlulp.acd that the Committee will have come anywhero ooniiietiiis Hs lar"or then. the -eiYEte of; New .Mexico.
