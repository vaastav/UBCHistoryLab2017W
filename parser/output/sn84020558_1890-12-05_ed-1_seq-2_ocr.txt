newspapers in El Frontcrizo and El Hijo del Frontcrio CmtisTMAs notions litter the stores Tho ono day in tho year when infancy reigns supreme is near at haud Now that the Central Pacific will soon become unreliable on account of snow a largo addition is to bo expected to tho travel on tho Southern Pacific Faiimeks aro now busy planting what will probably bo tho largest acreage of grain over put in in the Salt River Val loy Tho good prices of tho present sea son havo served to somewhat encourage agriculturists As lono as tho cottonwood continues to bo as luxuriant in this valley as it is no fear need bo entertained as to a scarcity of firewood Truo the fuel is not as hard and lasting as mosquito but it is available and cheap General Mile is occasionally men tioned as seeking tho Republican Presi dential nomination but there can bo no doubt that tho unanimous voice of the West will bo heard in tho National Con vention uplifted for that great patriot and statesman James G Blnino The rainy season is hero Arizona has been struck by tho edgo of what tho weather bureau ia pleased to term a cyclonic disturbance Tho rain is wel come Nearly all tho barley and fall grain is planted and up and theso showers will almost ensuro a bountiful harvest The two kinds of time kept in Phcunix ia simply maddening Tho usual pro cedure after tho inspection of a clock is to ask its owner Is that railroad or local time One of tho two times mus bo unanimously adopted or tho insane asylum will havo a plethora of patients from Maricopa County Necessity for irrigation in this valley ia growing less and less aa tho yeara ad vance One farmer living six miles south of Tempo reaped 1400 pounds of wheat per aero last summer from a field of wheat that had been given but one Irrigation and that irrigation was prior to plowing Another not far distant obtainsd 1200 pounds per acre from a piece of spring wheat that waa irrigated only once and that very poorly in April Foil tho first timo in tho history of Arizona tho peoplo of this Territory had tho Presidents message laid before them in full tho next morning after it was read in Congress They can thank Tnn Republican for this privilege for it waa only through its push and enter prise that such a thing waa possible Heretofore they had to wait forty eight to seventy two hours for tho San Fran cisco papers to get hero to get tho full news of tho world It is wonderful how politics aro allowed by somo mon to warp their every thought President Harrisons message was n calm matter of fact digest of tho reports from different departments of tho public service to which wero added brief comments con taining tho Presidents viewa in each matter discussed Yet in their hasto to belittle a man who lias done much to advanco tho Nations interosta and who haa given to tho country an administra tion without a blot tho Democratic organs aro vying with each other in flinging at him tho atinkpota of abuse The Prescott Courier editor is road boiling mad and no wonder Ho had the contract for county printing and tho recent grand jury when it submitted its report touched the county printing question in tho following language Wo find that the official printer of tho county has been allowed and paid f 75 for extra print ing 150 of this amount was for printing the lection proclamation and 25 tor publishing In the Prescott Courier a lettee replying to an ar ticle by Sheriff ONeill allecting county Inter ests Both of theso Items appear to be fully cov ered by the contract of the county with said printer and have therefore been Illegally paid and allow cd The election proclamation Is re quired by law and therefore comes under the provisions of the the contract by a direct specifi cation Tho other item should have been paid for by the Atlantic- Paclfio Rail road Company or its attorneys rather than by this county This committee holds that under no coloring ot tho law can these charges be legalised they have been psJd in excess of the contract covering such printing and are Illegal We therefore recommend that tho District Attomeybedlroctedtolustltutesult against the Board and the contractor for the recovery to the county of the sums thus Illegally and without Just claim paid to tho said con tractor We further find that the Hoard hud al lowed the official printer of the county fi2 for printing a brief In the appealed tbeotseof ONeill vs Yavapai county Under a strict in terpretation ot tho contract this is also an Illegal charge and appears to have been al lowed without reference to tho contract or tho interests of the county This is also a natter to which we believe tho attention ot the Dis trict Attorney should be dlrectedand we recom mend that it bo done F n yon 

SALE THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN PHOENIX FRIDAY MORNING DECEMBER 5 1890 It ia delicious to read of the indigna tion of tho Democratic and especially tho Mugwump press towards Senator Quay Senator Quay is a sharp man he believes in running a campaign to win Ho believes in exactly such methods as does Governor Hill of Now York Senator Gorman of Maryland Calvin U Urico ol Now York and Ohio and they all obtained their ideas from that glorified Democrat Samuel J Tilden In tho late Presidential cam paign tho then President of tho United States sent 10000 to Cnlvin 15 Brieo knowing that the money would bo used for the election of a gentleman who be lieves entirely in Mr Quays methods of conducting a campaign Now wo havo no excuses to make for Senator Quay but wo respectfully submit that when men denounce Mr Quay and hii methods and at tho samo timo have none but soft words for Mr Gorman Mr Urico and Governor Hill and who hold the memory of Mr Tilden aa soino thing sacred in tho history of their country thoy aro running tho risk of having somo envious person declaring a full belief in their cntiro inconsistency About half of tho Democratic press of this country has been charging for two years past that tho electoral vote of New York was traded away by Governor Hill through an arrangement between tho Governor and Mr Quay but these papers that aro denouncing Mr Quay for a rogue aro half expecting to support Mr Hill for tho Presidency for 1892 which ia another proof that sometimes consistency loses all her jowolry Only for tho fact that tho character of tho pcoplo in chargo ia ao well known tho attacks upon tho courtB by tho Democratic organ of thin city would bo worthy tho notice of the court in citing them to appear for contempt It re minds one most forcibly of the old ndage that no thief oer felt tho halter draw with good opinion of tho law IUnakes a great difference with the sheet which is like master liko man in this case only to bo seen to bo despised which side of tho question is represented Yestorday morning it said of the present grand jury wmcii is composed ex clusively of Democrats and Mormons We never knew that Jurors were questioned or objected to on the grounds of their politics the Idea Is as absurd as it Is debating in ttie same issue in following up a base and cowardly attack begun some timo ago upon tho Circuit Judges of tho Territory it said If one sixteenth of the laws that are now being prepared against the Ariiona Judiciary are passed few more political decisions will be Indulged In in this Terrltorj The Republican at this time will not comment upon theso Attacks upon tho courts but simply give these examples to show tho atato of mind of tho pcoplo making them If thoy only owned the whole court so that their stealings would not daro be questioned how aupremely lovely everything would be WAHrsj The quickest returns for the least money are to be obtained from the Republicans Want Columns Situations Wjntod Help Wanted For Rent For 8ale To Let To Exchange One Cent a word each Insertion or by the month at Five Cents per line per day
