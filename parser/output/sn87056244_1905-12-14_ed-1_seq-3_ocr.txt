SENATOR MITCHELL DEAD. End Is Hastened by Ding-race at Clone of Brilliant Career. United States Senator John II. Mitch ell of Oregon died at Portland,. his death having been due to complications which followed the re moval of four teeth by a dentist. Hem orrhages ' which could not be check ed followed the ex traction, of the teeth. The Senator, who had been in 2 fCY J the limelight of Ore T J j, son politics for half if 6' a century, died alone. The widow is in Taris, where 6he has lived since the marriage of her daughter, Margaret, to the Duke of Rochefoucauld. Death has saved the Senator from the peni tentiary. He was under sentence of two years for his conuectlon with a con spiracy to defraud the government of 000,000 acres of public lands In the Northwest, , . Senator Mitchell was -born in Wash ington county, Ta., in June, 1835. He was graduated at Butler academy and practiced law in Pennsylvania until 1SCO, when he removed to California. After a few months in San Francisco he located at Portland. Ore. There he en tered politics, was elected to the State Senate in 1SG2. and to the United States Senate in 1873. When the Democrats controlled the Legislature Mitchell re turned to his law practice, but in .1001 was again sent to the United States Sen- cte. Uis political prestige had been on the wane since the conspiracy charge was brought against him. His health declined rapidly after he was convicted last summer. - ASKS MILLIONS FOR DOCKS. Rear Admiral Endicott Estimates Expense at f 0,993,107. Three new dry docks practically com pleted, a number of new buildings con structed, extensions of the railroads in the yards and of the sewer systems, '.ighting syftem and pavement and other jjiscellaaeous improvements are features )f the work accomplished during the rast year under the bureau of yards and docks, as recorded m the annual report of the chief of that bureau, Rear Ad miral Endicott. For the next fiscal year the estimates of this bureau aggregate $9.905,197. Of this amount almost $9,000.000 is recom mended for improvement of public works. Regarding this item Admiral Endicott says: "The estimates for central heat, light and power plants at various yards are necessary for the execution of the expressed will of Congress and the in structions of the department touching the consolidation of power plants. Ad ditional docking facilities are most ur gently needed and estimates are submit ted for beginning docks at Boston, Pen sacola and Fuget sound "and for a fteel floating dock for home waters." It is pointed out that it takes a con siderable time to construct a dry dock of large capacity and that by the time these docks now asked for could be com pleted the vessels Of the navy will have increased in number very materially and the demand for docks will be corre spondingly greater than at present. Mill . Plans are under way to shorten the route of th Baltimore and Ohio road between Chicago and Baltimore 100 miles. . According to estimates of operating officials of the Panhandle road the cost of improvements contemplated for next year will be about $5.000,000. Preparations are being made by the Illinois roads affected by the order of the State Railroad and Warehouse Com missioners for horizontal reduction of 20 per cent in official freisht rates now in effect, to oppose the order on the ground that it is unfair and unjust to the rail roads and an extreme case of discrimina tion, which will damage the railroad business in the State. The hearing of the case of the Pine Island Farmers Elevator Company of Pine Island, Minn., against the Chicago Great Western railway, involving alleged discrimination in the matter of freight rates on grain, is to be held In St. Paul. A solid through train from Chicago to Los Angeles bas been placed in service over the Chicago, Union Pacific and Northwestern line and the rewly opened Salt Lake rojUe. The train is electric lighted throughout. . The schedule time of the new train is sixty-eight hours. The Boston and Maine railroad was authorized by the Railroad Commission ers of the State of Massachusetts to is sue $10,000,000 twenty-year 4 per cent bonds. The issue is to refund expiring bonds which include $7,724,500 6 per cent Eastern railway certificates of in debtedness: $2,000,000 5 per cent Cen tral Massachusetts bonds and $594,000 C per - cent Eastern . railroad mortgage bonds. Sixty of the most powerful and mod ern locomotives ever constructed are now being received by the r Illinois Central railroad for service. on the Chicago-St. Paul, Chicago-Omaha and Chicago-New Orleans lines. The engines are CO in number, 50 being about equally divided between the passenger and freight de partments and 10. for the switching ser vice." Tbe passenger engines are of the Pacific type and aro beauties - : They weigh 223,000 pounds, have a capacity of 7,000 gallors of water and 15 tons of coat and their "driving-wheels are 7 feet 3 Inches in ' diameter. : They are guaranteed to cover -75 , to CO miles an hour. . i , The well-known writer on railroad sub jects, Mr. Frank?H.

II. MITCHELL. OÄ-tn AND O? fNARCIAL The new high level general business has at talued Is strongly out Chicago. lined by the current volume of bank exchanges. The latter for November exceeds those of the corresponding month last year, and a comparison of the twenty-four working days In No vember with the twenty-six working days of October exhibits an average gain of close upon two and a half mil lion dollars daily for the month Just closed. This present progress may be en tirely credited to industrial efforts, the usual speculative channels being com paratively quiet. Money remains at the highest value this year, bat there is slight prospect of a cheaper rate for mercantile needs while railroad block ades delay grain remittances. The. coarse of trade discloses no de velopments this week aside from fur ther commitments which add strength. Prices display exceptional strength in both raw material and finish'xl prod ucts. Chicago pig Iron at $20 a ton and bar iron at $40 reflect an excess of demand over supply In this . market Other quotations showing advances appear In grain, provisions and live stock, while recent appreciations are firmly upheld In lumber, hides and leather. Operations In tQxtiles arc af fected by disturbing estimates of cot ton growth and high wool values, yet the Interior buying for spring delivery compares well with a year ago. Seasonable weather gave an Impetus to distributive trade, and the general demand again drew sharply upon ship ping facilities. The absorption of household needs and heavy apparel has been large, and gratifying retail sales were made In footwear and Christmas goods. O Failures reported in tVe Chicago dis trict number 22. agafrr.t 21 last week and 23 a year ago. Dun's Review of Trade. Mild weather retarded retail trade early in the week, except In holiday Net York. supplies, tht wide-spread cold wave later offered a needed corrective and stimulus to the only lines hitherto backward. Weather conditions now are likely to bring the long continued season for outdoor work to a close, and especially affect the building trades, which have had the most active year In their history. Something like sea sonable quiet is reported In many lines of wholesale trade, but it Is noted that Jobbers and manufacturers are tili very busily engaged on holiday goods, some lines of which are already report ed oversold. Indicating that a record year's business will be garnered. All reports as to spring trade are satisfac tory, but hitherto mild weather and car congestion an? responsible for re ports of rather backward trade and of slow collections In the Northwest Business failures for the week ending Nov. 30 number 185. against 224 last week. 184 In the like week of ir04. 230 In 1903.

These figures do not include 3,029 en listed men of the hospital corps, who, under the act of March 1, 1SS7, are not to be counted as part of the enlisted strength of the regular army. There were also ir. the service 25 offi cers and 552 enlisted men of the Forto Rico regiment and 113 officers and 5,059 enlisted Philippine scouts. This is a net increase of 7 in the Torlo Rico regi ment, and of 1.00G in the Philippine scouts. Secretary Taft urges an increase in the seacoast avtillery by 5,000 men, with the necessary .jomplemtnt of officers. He siys the expeLses will be $3,000,000 per annum. lie rtoes not, however, recom mend a reduction ia the cavalry force. He says: I am firmly convinced of the wisdom of providing more men for the coast ar tillery. Our seacoast fortifications, con structed at such heavy expense, ought not to be left as they are now, without the number of men to properly handle and operate the heavy guns, with their complicated mechanism and extensive ac cessories, and to give them the degree of care that is necessary in order to main tain these elaborate defensive works in the proper condition of preservation and efficiency." Secretary Taft reviews the progress made in the construction of seacoast for tifications. Up to the present time there have been emplaced 101 twelve-inch guns, 119 ten-inch, 94 eight-inch, 3G7 twelve-inch mortars, and 231 rapid fire guns. Eighty per cent of the work of fortification planned by the Endicott board in 1SSG has been completed. The system of government telegraph and cable lines in Alaska, begun in 1Ö00 and finished in October. 1904, con sists of a system of land lines in north western Alaska, extending from Nome to Valdez, and a cable system connect ing all the important points in southeast ern Alaska with the telegraph system of the United States. During the year 134.G30 mesages were handled, the receipts from commercial messages amounting to $104.139.01: $20, 123.57 pertained to the transmission of messages over commercial lines namely, the Canadian government system, the White Pass and Yukon railway com pany, the Tostal Telegraph Ca "!! Com pany, and the Western Union Telegraph Company. The remainder. $78.015.44, was received for Alaskan telegrams han dled by the signal corps alone. The Secretary urges the construction of a submarine telegraph cable to con nect the Panama canal zone with the United States. lie says such ? line, from Tampa, via Guantanamo to Pan ama, would cost $1,000,000. If extended to Porto Rico the line would cost $3G0, 000 more. Secretary Taft reviews the work on the Panama canal at length, the sub stance of this part of his report al ready having been made public. The Secretary asks Congress to appro priate for, the expense of the army and the War Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, $70,170.719.' ASK BIG 

APPROPRIATIONS. Almost a Billion Dollars Needed to Carry on Government A statement has been issued by th appropriations committees of the Senate and House summarizing the estimates for appropriations to be made at th present session of Congress for the fiscal year 1907. The total for all purposes ag gre'gates $S04.29G.413.- These estimates are greater than th appropriations for the current year bj $19.170,155. The Wr Department asks $SG3,4C3 less than was appropriated last yea? and the rier and harbors item, whk last year amounted to $18,1S1,875, h omitted entirely this year. With thesr exceptions every department of the gov ernment has asked for more money than the current appropriation. The two largest increases are asked by the navy, $21,229.03S. and the Post office Department, $12.187.97G. The estimates of the appropriations committees exceed those of Secretary Shaw by nearly $200,000,000, which is accounted for by the fact that the Sec retary of the Treasury estimates for the Postoffice Department only that sum which will have to come from the treas ury for Its maintenance, not including postal revenues applied to the support of that department. His estimate for the Postofflce Department is $7,620.000, while that of the appropriations commit tees Is $193.230.070. Interesting Ne Items, Miss Marjorie M.

CHAPTER IX. For some reason Pauline Mailing was m a very Irritable state of mind. Per haps she was regretting the moment's impulse that had prompted her to ac cept a nameless young painter. Babette, too, seemingly had a weight on her mind. She crept about her work, laying out Miss Mailing's elegant evening toilet with a subdued air very different from her usual noiseless activity. Babette was doing her best to get through her duties, when, as ill luck would have It, memory for a moment asserted Itself and brought before her a picture of a pretty black eyed urchin tossing from side to side in his small cot and crying out her name unceasingly as he refused the cooling drink offered by a hand he did not love. The maid sobbed sobbed audibly. Miss Mailing raised her eyes from their contemplation of the carpet and looked in dignified surprise at tbe young French weman. Noting for the first time the signs of tears on her face, Miss Malliug felt angry. "What La heaven's name is the matter with you, Babette? Pray don't let me have any weeping and wailing. If there Is one thing that exasperates me more than another, it is a crying woman." 'Pardon, mademoiselle; the grief over came me in spite of myself. I did not intend to speak; but, as you have noticed my sorrow, I will make bold to tell you that 1 have a little stepbrother, the only beiug In the world who 13 related to me, and l.have here a letter telling me he Is very ill, and that he asks for me night and day night and day." The poor girl's voice broke for a moment; but she rallied and went on. "If mademoiselle could tpare me for just enough time to get to Boulogne and back to see the poor little fellow!" "And what am I to do in the mean time??" Pauline asked icily. 'Of course you can go if you like; but you need not come back. I am surprised you should ask me such an insane thing, when you know the house will be full of people the day after to-morrow. I could not possi bly do without you. Pray do not say an other word about it, and please leave off crying." Babette moved away to the far end of the room, wiped her eyes, and stood for an instant Quite still, repressing the cobs that shook her frame. "If my little Pierre dies without see ing me I will never forgive you never! I will watch f or a chance of doing you a great harm; and it will coma if I am patient," the girl thought. After dressing Miss Mailing and mak ing the dressing room tidy, Babette pars ed through the picture gallery on her way to Mrs. Perkins' sanctum for her usual cup of tea. Thinking everybody must be dowustairs, sue stopped at Jack's easel and looked at Pauline's picture. "So you think the world Is made for your pleasure? You are too high a lady to troub.e yourself with your servants' affairs; but perhaps they will trouble themselves with yours, madame! 1 have seeu you flinch and shrivel up strangely 6ouetimes. People don't shrivel up for noih.ng, unless they have a fear of some thing; and if they have a secret fear, there must be something bad to cause U. It my little darling dies without the Comfort of kissing his Babette once, it will be your fault; and all my life long I will watch, watch, watch, to try to repay your cruelty to me and him!" and she looked as if she meant it. Jack, who had stopped until tbe last moment hn.shiug his rather difficult let ter to Ethel m his own room, was struck by the intease hatred in the woman's face as be opeaed the door, wondered for the moment what could have caused it, wished the next that he could call it up at will and use her as a model for a fiend, and the next moment forgot all about iL Throwing his letter on the hall table, he hurried into tue drawing room to tüjke hts peace for being late. lia bette tad her quiet cup of tea with Mrs. Perkins, and, with a plentiful shed ding of tears, wrote to the woman who had charge of little Pierre, to say that she could not come to her darling just now. The letter was full of loving messages and promises, and the poor girl's heart felt very heavy as she put it into the bag. She had taken it into the hall her self. There was another letter lying there ready stamped for the post; she took it up carelessly, recognized it by the red seal as the one Jack had had in his hand when he passed her in the gallery, and stood transfixed with surprise as she read the address. "The address of that pretty demoiselle that 1 followed home from the museum, by her orders! Why, there is something in th! Why, if she wants the address of a lady who is known to Monsieur Dornten, does she not ask him, instead of setting me to follow her like a po liceman? 1 shall have that to find out!" "Babette, 1 want you," Mrs. Perkins Called from the door that ' shut off the servants quarters. Something in the voice, some subtle touch of sympathy, struck Babette's quick ear. She turned so sharply that Mrs. Perkins had not time to conceal the black bordered letter she held In her fraud. With a heart rending cry, Babette started forward and snatched the letter from her. She was a quick, impetuous, unreason ing and unreasonable creature; she did not stop to consider that she could not havj reached the child -even If Pauline had piven her Instant consent She re membered only that her mistress had been cruel to her in the time of her trouble; and she registered a vow that, if there was any secret in Pauline Mail ing's past life, she would hunt it out and humiliate her. T A letter lay by Ethel's plate; but she did not touch It. Mr. Mallett, self-absorbed as ever, did not notice how his daughter was struggling to preserve her usual composure all through the break fast time. Jack Dornton had not intended to be cruel when he wrote: but. after destroy ing a dozen sheets of paper in his desire to be neither too soft nor too hard, he decided at last that tbe shorter and plain er he made it tbe better; and this was what he had written: ' "My ' Dear Ethel I should not hare had the courage to do as you have done; but perhaps you are right as indeed you always -are. For the future will you allow me to consider myself "Your faithful friend. ? "JOHN DORNTON?" "I am glad so very glad I wrote it. It would have been dreadful if we had Darrled. and Jack had found out that h did not care for ma afterward.. Now I " had better destroy that anonymous letter. J thought that perhaps Jack dt hart wished tht enar enitit t 4 yy ife's becrct I OR A BITTER RECKONING ! CHARLOTTE AI. BRAEMB continue, in which case I should have sent the letter to him and asked for an explanation." So Ethel went bravely about her home duties, though her very lips were white with the restraint she was putting on her feelings. She tried with all her strength of mind she possessed to put her humiliating grief away from her. VWhy should 1 sorrow for him If he can throw me off without one word of regret?" she asked herself, angrily. Still, la spite of her determination to crush her love under the weight of her self-respect, she now and again felt as if her heart would break. She resolute ly denied herself the relief of tears, and suffered far more intensely in conse quence. The thrushes and the lively robins and perky sparrows were having a good time of it on the lawns at the Wigwam that morning. Captain Pelling was fond of these small birus, and liked to see them about the place, and he had determined to do what he could to tame them dur ing the hard winter weather, should he decide to 6tay on in the Wigwam, which he had taken furnished for six months. He did not take much notice of the little creatures thi3 morning, though. He was in a "brown study." and sat so motion less on his comfortable cane chair under the veranda that the more courageous of the birds hopped about within a yard of his feet. The fact was Captain Pelling was dis appointed. , He had expected a letter either from Ethel or Mr. Mallett that morning, to settle their visit on the mor row. "Even if they do not care to come," he told himself, "they might have been civil enough to send some conventional excuse." After awhile it occurred to him that perhaps the Mallets had written, and that the letter had miscarried and he felt somewhat relieved at the bare idea, lie made up his mind that he would go up to town in any case; and as he went along he would decide upon what course he would pursue. And all through his vacillation he never once admitted to himself that it was his longing to see Ethel again that had for the moment transformed him into a human shuttle cock. Notwithstanding a short notice, the phaeton was ready a minute before the appointed time, looking perfect in every detail. Pelling had the reins in his hand and his foot on tbe step4 when he noticed a telegraph boy coming toward the house. He waited a moment. Yes, it was for him! "From Geoffrey Mallett, Buckingham street, Bloomsbury, to Captain Pelling, The Wigwam, Wimbledon. Shall be with you at 2 o'clock to-morrow. Get sketches in inspection order." And the man of thirty felt a lad again in his light-heartedness, as he sent his handsome bays along the road. CHAPTER X. Jack's love-making went on swim mingly during the lovely summer weath er and among the beauties of Mailing ford. The house was full of visitors now, ajid, In accordance with Pauline's wishes, their engagement was kept strict ly private. Still, in spite of all their care, the state of affairs was pretty shrewdly guessed at by most of the peo ple about them, and the well-bred guests wondered immensely at Miss Mailing's sudden fit of unworldliness. Strangely enough, Babette, with all her sharpness, was one of the last to hear of her mis tress' infatuation for the "artist .chap," as he was scornfully described among the servants; but the moment she did hear of it she began wondering and watching un til in her own mind 6he was sure that Miss Mailing was really deeply in love with this good-looking Mr. Dornton. Babette liked Jack, and, knowing, as she believed 6he did, the evil of Pauline's heart, she was sorry to think that such an altogether too charming yonug man should be so thrown way. So Babette was always on the watch for some clew that would help her to discover her young mistress' secret; and at this time she showed great interest in Mrs. Perkins' gossip about the family hoping to glean some scrap of informa tion that might be of use to her In fur thering her revengeful purpose. "And if mademoiselle had married against the wishes of Milord Summers, or without his consent, she would have lost the whole estate?" she asked, one evening in August, as she sipped her tea leisurely. "Yes, if she did so before she was twenty-five; , but after her twenty-fifth birthday she wui be free to marry whom soever she pleases; and, as she will be twenty-five on the seventeenth of next month, there is not much chance of her sacrificing the estate at this late day, after waiting until now." "That Is so," observed Babette, with a disappointed air. She reflected for a few moments, and a flash of intelligence crossed her face' as she asked, "And if mademoiselle had married in her ex treme youth before she was known as the heiress of the property how then?" . "I think she would lose everything." "Who would have it after her?" "Sir Geoffrey, the late baronet's brother." "To be sure! It must have been a great blow to him when he found himself rob bed of everything by his brother's in justice What did he do? Where did he go?" "I don't know. He Is as proud as any of the family, and, when his brother told him never to come near the place again, he put on his hat without one word, and walked away with his head as high as if he were the heir of thousands. We've never seen a sight of him since that day, and it's my belief ' we never shall." Babette believed she had found the keynote to Pauline's secret trouble. That there was secret trouble she never doubt for an .instant She had observed her mistress too closely to be misled on that point; she knew that nothing but some mighty fear could cause those sudden starts, followed by periods of anxious, heavy-browed thought, to which- she was subject. And, when Babette went up stairs, she reasoned the matter out. I have beard that she never knew sha wa9 her uncle's heiress until after her father's death. What is more likely then than she. should have' married out there ia Italy married some poor idiot who was caught by her prettj face? And then, when my lady suddenly finds that she is a rich woman, she is tired of thl3 poor fool, and runs away and enjoys her life by htrxslf. I believe I have found the dart tpot in my fin lady's life! If this bul think, I cai take frca her hz3 tdzrti fiance and her riches at cue blow. How glorious that would be! Uer face glowed with savage satl faction at the bare thought of so com plete a revenge. She left her seat by thi bay window of Pauline's dressing room, and paced up and down, her excitement being too great for her to remain stilL The dusky gloom deepened until the room was all in shadow, and presently a house maid came In and lighted the candles in the large silver branches on tho toilet table. As the door closed behind the maid Ba bette resumed her promenade, and came to a sudden stop as her eyes rested on the key left in the lock of a small bronze box. This box contained Miss Mailing's private keys! She locked up very littles but what she did lock up sho was rather particular about, and her keys were In variably kept in this Indian box, ttl key of which she carried about with her. As Babette stood looking with a dull, fascinated gaze at the key, she beard the rustle of silken skirts in tbe gallery outside. With a swoop like a hawk's, so swift and noiseless was it, she pluck ed the little key from the lock and slip ped it into the pocket of her dainty frill ed apron. The next instant Miss Mallina turned the handle of the door and saw Babette rearranging tha lace draperies round the looking glass. She crossed th room and went straight to the table, glanced quickly at the box, and then turned to Babette. "Have you seen the key of this box?" "Not to-day, mademoiselle." "rrovokingl" She took it up ia her hands and shook It. Yes. the keys an inside. Babette, I wish you not to leave these rooms to-night until I come up to bed. I have dropped the key some where. I don't suppose it will be found until we have daylight to help us it li so small. Have your supper sent up to you here." "Very good, mademoiselle." Babette stood with her hands held tightly over her heart, listening to the rustle of the silken skirts along the gal lery and down the stairs. Then her expression changed from strained atten tion to vivid triumph. She threw her clasped hands high over her head. She locked both doors, closed oce window to prevent the blinds from fluttering, and then unlocked the small bronze box. She laughed as she picked out a key from the bunch and tried to unlock Pauline's large desk. "At last!" she whispered, as the lock of the desk flew baci. To be rantlnned.) SHE LOSES BA6IES. Woman Makes a Regular Trade of Abandoning Infants. There are many ways of getting a living In this city, some persons even working for It, but the most amazlnj of them all was partly unfolded In the Tombs court recently, when It was alleged there was a regular estab lished business for "losing babies" here, the headquarters of the gang be ing somewhere on Mott street, says the New York Press. Detectives were searching for a woman on that street For a long time the managers of children societies have been con vinced that the "losing" of babies has been conducted systematically and they will be both surprised and pleased If the present case does not develop the fact that "losing" Is only an In cident. That any one would care to part with an infant is something hard ly to be believed by the normal moth er, but for many months the officers of the societies have found too much sys tem in the abandonment of babies not to believe there was a regular trade In it Of course, every one has beard of tbe man who wouldn't sell bis twins for $1,000,000, but wouldn't give 10 cents for another pair, but the Idea that women would enter Into scheme of disposing of. inconvenient Infants was so revolting that the societies were long in taking any action. They got a lead on June C, however, when an abandoned infant was found on the gallery of Brooklyn bridge. That incident may be remembered, as tho little one was in a common grocer's basket which had been laid on the floor near the ticket office. Thousands Lurried past but no one paid any at tention to the basket covered with a piece of linen, until nn employe on the bridge took some interest The rush crowd simply parted and passed by on either side until the em ploye found in the basket one of the prettiest babies any one had seen for a long time. Then the women In the. crowd, and the men, too, had time to stop for a moment and feci sorry for, the abandoned little one. But one Howe, of the Oak street police staT tion, had other things to do than feel sorry, and made a little discovery that: he kept to himself until he had a! chance to work up his clew and see if there was anything in it On a bit of cloth swaddling the babe he found the name "Varlco." It wasn't much to go on, but Howe had ideas of his own, and asked the precinct commander if he night go to work on It Of course, the case prop erly belonged to the headquarters staff, but all detectives don't wear plain clothes, so Howe was told to go ahead and be careful to make no blunders. Following up the faintly defined came on the babe's clothing, the police-, man arrested Mrs. Marie Varico and Mrs. Antoinette Tonella, of 85 Madi-' son street Magistrate Wahle heard the case and was so amazed at first that he might not nave taken any ac tion had it not been that the two wo men got to quarreling in court each one accusing the other of abandoning the Infant . "That woman' stole my baby," said Mrs. VaricO. - "I did not," retorted Mrs. Tonella. "You know you gave the child to me to take to a woman In Mott street who makes a business of disposing of ba bies. She told me that the baby was alive and happy in a home in Brook lyn." 1 Then the magistrate became greatly interested and held the tvo' women. He also learned the name and ad&res. of the woman on Mott street Artful Iodsccr. ne Then I may hope? She Well, you may ask papa. He Impossible. She Why do you say that?
