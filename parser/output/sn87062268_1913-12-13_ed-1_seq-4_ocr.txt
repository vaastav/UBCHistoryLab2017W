Solicitor Lof tin Should Be Invited to Help. It would seem proper. In view of the developments before the board of county commissioners last Wednesday Vmotnitig, that County Solicitor Lof tin ' fee Invited to help Investigate the sher iffs office and the acts of the sheriff and his deputies during: the past few months. If the revelations are" the re sult of onlj a casual examination of jthe sheriff's accounts, as stated by i County Auditor llacgibbon, then the j county solicitor may exercise these j powers conferred upon him by the ?tate and make a thorough cxamina jtion of al! matters relating to the of 'fioe. . , , The solicitor has the power of a ! grand Jury. He can have witnesses ! summoned and examine them under joath. He can cause the production of records and papers and he can force 'the attendance of officers as -well as citizens to give testimony if he sus pects there have been any irregulari ties. The county auditor says the sher iff has charged mileage for many miles .never traveled and that he has sub mitted bills for the taxpayers of Es :' cambia c.ounty to pay where service was never rendered. Charges of grave character have been made and the county auditor says he stands ready to prove them. The proposed inquiry by ,the county com missioners will be beneficial in clari fying the situation. The audit of the 'sheriff's books and accounts by a state auditor wilLl If the governor sees lit ,' to "send one here, further satisfy pub lic curiosity as to the facts. But what Is really needed, in justice to both -the eherlff and the(taxpayers, is a thorough jod rigid Investigation by the county solicitor. 1 ' The Journal suggests that, at this coming meeting, the county commis sioners invito Solicitor Loftln to be present and assist them in the in vestigation. He Is familiar with the criminal costs system and with much t the work connected with the sher iffs office, and he can be of gTeat as sistance in securing all of the facts. ; O . . Disgusting and Cowardly Speech By a Man. The woman suffrage campaign in the United States is conducted on a high plane and by able and dignified i lead ers. Whatever may be said of the suffrage methods in England no one can charge that the suffrage leaders in, this country have done anything that would in any way bring reproach upon the name of American woman hood. It has remained for one of the man opponents of the equal suffrage cause to make a small, cowardly and alto gether unmanly attack upon the good

Last week a delegation of women appeared before the committee on rules in the bouse of representatives to ask tliat an equal suffrage commit tee be appointed in the house. An op position delegation aJso appeared and one of the spokesmen was a man from New York, who referred to Dr. Anna iJhaW president of the national wom an's suffrage organization, in these un manly terms: When I saw this person here ycater dav shake her clinched fist and de clare, "W demand our risrhts," I said to niyeelf. "Clinched fists mean fight." The manhood of this nation has been trained to respect and revere woman hood and I claim that for American womanhood today, but if we are chal lenged to flsht this movement there will be blows to give as well as blows to take. What decent man would be guilty of such talk as that? Who but a coward would talk about "giving blows" in a contest where any woman good or bad is an opponent?. It may be that "this person." Dr. An na Howard, is leading a cause that does not find favor with all men or all women, but in addition to being a woman she Is one of the bralnest, most conscientious, and devotedly Christian characters whom the Am erican platform has ever known. Such cowardly and disgusting ex hibitions as the New York man .maue of himself should earn for him the contempt of all decent men. 

FLORIDA'S CAMPAIGN FOR UNITED STATES SENATOR Many Papers For Stockton Kx-governor Albert W. Gilchrist, who anonunced his candidacy for the United States senate, to succeed Sen ator Fletcher, eeveral weeks ago, has withdrawn from the race. John N. O Stockton is now the pnly candidate aea'r.'t Senator Vletc- an " e r o promises to be intereating. Many state papers have announced for Stock :on and a prreat many are yet to be heard from. Like City Inclex. Excellent Generalship' The T npa Tribune of this morn ing contains the announcement of Ex Governor Gilchrist's withdrawal from the senatorial race. The general has shown excellent generalship and rare good sense. Bartow Courier Inform ant. Congratulations to Fletcher Senator Fletcher is . be congrat ulated that his Mntiring efforts on behalf of the establishment of the rural credit system which will result in moro substantial benefit to a larger number of the people of this country than' any measure now on the demo cratic legislative program,' received the full and cordial endorsement of the president in his message to congress on Tuesday. With Senator Fletcher pushing the bill which he has already introduced in the senate and the pow erful proarressvie support it will un doubtedly receive in the house, and with the endorsement and assistance of the president, the rural credit sys tem seems to be In a fair way to be come an accomplished fact before the end of the present session of congress. Bartow Courier Informant. Plenty Time and Money Hon. Albert Gilchrist has retired from the race for the U. S. senator al most before he started. He gives as his reason that his other busines will take all of his time and that he would have no time to devote to the- sen atorial business. Albert need not worry about the time of a senator. They us ually have plenty af time and money, and what more could a man wish for? Sanford Herald. Boosts Charles Parkhill The Tampa Times, referring to the withdrawal of Ex-Governor Gilchrist from the senatorial race, says: "We are deeply., and vitally interested lo cally in this matter. Tampa has in terests that will be directly and per haps prejudicially affected by the con tinuance of the monopoly of both seats by a rival city; South Florida and the rest of the state outside of the northeast corner are ready to revolt against the Jacksonville grab and greed. Now Is the time for some South Floridian with grit, vim and stead fastness to shy his hat into the ring." Without any disparagement to the other candidates, if South Florida must have a candidate for United States senator, the very strongest man that section could possibly put forward for the position is Hon. Chas. B. Parkhill. He is the peer of any man In the country, both in point of mental abil ity and oratory. He is especially pro ulsr in Wt Florida, where he for merly resided until resigning" as a rnemoer of the supreme court and re moving1 to Tampa, and If South Flor ida gave him the support which the Times indicates a South Florida man would receive, Charlie Parkhill would be hard to beat. Gainesville Sun. Sorry He Has Withdrawn The Star is sorry that ex-Governor Gilchrist his withdrawn from the sen atorial race. Some man may be shoved in to take votes away from Fletcher or Stockton who in the case of his election would not make as good a senator as Mr. Gilchrist. Ocala, Star. How Traveling Men Think Supplementing the little by-play originating in the Truth regarding J. X. C. Stockton's Initials, we wonder if it hns ever occurred to our contempo raries that the traveling men Don't Uphold Fletcher. Zolfo Springs Truth. t Fletcher's Prominen Alore than any other, public man in this country is Senator Fletcher of this state identified with the pro posed financial legislation in behalf of rural credits which win make it vossible for farmers to sret loner time loans at low interest. Senator Fletcher studied this system in Europe and is now its chief advocate In this coun try. Yesterday President Wilson in his message to congress definitely en dorsed this system and it goes without saying that our senior senator Is feel ing mighty good to get such strong backing" for his measure. Lakeland Telegram. Very Sensibly Ex-Governor Albert W. Gilchrist has very sensibly announced his withdraw al from the senatorial contest. Wau chula Advocate. Congratulate Gilchrist We congratulate the "Gentleman from DeSoto.for withdrawing from the senatorial race, for he undoubtedly showed more wisdom in withdrawing than he Ud in entering the game.
