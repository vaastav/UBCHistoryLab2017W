VIOLATED THE LAWS OF WAR Major in the Filipino Insurgent Army Sentenced to Hang. Washington, Dec. 4.The incoming mail from the Philippines brought to the war department a batch of rec ords of courtmartial trials in that army division Juan M. Guiterrez, a major in the insurgent army, was tried on a charge of "murdering prisoners in violation of the laws of war." He was in command of a number of insurgent companies which were retreating before an ad vancing force of American soldiers and held captive Private John Hus keth of Company H, Twenty-ninth volunteer infantry, and George Sulli van, an American non-combatant. When the American forces pressed so closely as to convince the insurgent major that the recapture of his pris oners was inevitable, he ordered Hil ario Quesada, a second lieutenant of his command (who has been tried and sentenced by an American countmar itial), to kill them "to keep them from disclosing the hidden mountain re treats of the guerrilla bands." The two prisoners were put to death. Guitenez was sentenced to be hanged and General Chaffee approved the sentence. GERMANY'S UNEMPLOYED. Four Per Cent of Her Artisans Are Out of Work.

These investigations have resulted in showing that 20,000 men are em rloyed in the metal trades today, as against 73,100 in these same trades- in the month of October, 1900. The work ing hour has been reduced in naif of the factories The unemployed in the largest towns amount to from 7 to 10 per cent of their populations and the Aggregate of unemployed in Germany reaches 500,000 men, or 4 per cent ol the total number of artisans the country. Snow Storm in New England. Boston, Dec 4 The heaviest snow storm for so early in the winter for years is covering New England. It came out of the northeast with the wind fully 40 miles an hour.

Colon, Colombia, Dec. 4.According to news just received here the interior of the country is almost entirely quiet. Only a few scattered and insignificant insurgent bands are here and there wagirg guerrilla warfare. This causes the gos srnment no anxiety. The triumph of the Colombian Con Bervative government on the Isthmus will doubtless incalculably strengthen the government's hands. A peace commission composed of Florencia Arosemena, representing prominent Liberals of Panama Manual Amador, representing the Colombian govern ment, and General De La Rosa, secre tary to the insurgent general, Domingo Diaz, who will act as guide, has al ready started for the interior to obtain an interview with Generals Diaz and Lugo and induce them to give up the struggle and return to Panama. Senor Amador is empowered to grant reason able terms to General Diaz in the name of the government. It is already rumored, however, that Generals Diaz and Lugo are about to surrender. The guard of American.' marines, which has been stationed in front of the offices of the railroad company here, has been withdrawn. A small detail of marines still accompanies the passenger trains across the Isth mus. Both ends of the Isthmus are ynet and orderly. COME IN DUTY FREE. Orders Issued Regarding Goods Im ported From the Philippines. Washington, Dec. 4.It was stated at the war department that the de cisions of the United States supreme court in the insular cases do not call for any change in the existing tariff arrangements in the Philippines and it was therefore deemed necessary to issue instructions to the civil gov ernor of the islands on the subject as a consequence of the decisions. Sec retary Root has had several confer ences with other officials in regard to the enactment of legislation neces sary to meet existing conditions, but he said during the day that as he had not yet received an official copy of the court's decisions, he was unable to even indicate what steps should be taken. The secretary of the treasury is sued to collectors of customs in the United States a telegraphic order di recting them to admit free of duty goods imported from the Philippine islands.

CHATS THE PBISTCETOST UNION: THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1901. WITH FARMERS- Wm. Gerth, one of the prosperous farmers who comes in from Germany quite frequently to market his produce here, was waiting his Jturn to unload potatoes the other day, and the UNION man stopped long enough to chat with him for a few minutes. Mr. Gerth has been a resident of Princeton township for twenty-nine years, and in fact used to slide down the cellar doors of the old settlers in his younger days. He says that the potato crop in his section was a good one, and that 250 bushels per acre was his yield. Corn, which grows very well in his section, yielded 50 bushels to the acre. He says there is little small grain raised in hi& sec tion now. During the last seven years the farmers have been paying consid erable attention to potatoes. The soil is a sandy loam with clay bottom, which insures such successful results in farming. Wheat went 25 bushels to the acre and was a fair crop. Mr. Gerth is opening up a new farm two and a half miles from where he has been farming. He possesses a practi cal knowledge of farming, and more than this is also interested in the ques tion of good roads. "Four years of continuous potato production will drain the ground of its potato maturing ca pacity," said Mr. Gerth, "and farmers should pay more attention to returning the productive elements to the soil by sowing clover or grass seed of some kind and converting the field into a pasture for two years or more. In this way the ground will preserve its fer tility and wear many years." In the matter of good roads Mr. Gerth thinks that "too many cooks spoil the broth" in road improvement. "The trouble in building country roads is that every time a new road overseer is elected the road is 'improved' to suit his particu lar whims. If his whims are on the practical order the road does not suffer, but if on the other hand he knows very little about building good roads, the farming community suffers. The trouble is that there is no fixed policy in the matter of making good roads." N. G. Orton of Greenbush while in town the other day took time to call at the 

UNION office and visit for a few minutes. He is a Greenbush boy, his folks having located in that section 44 years ago at which time the country was what you might call a "howling wilderness." Mr. Orton's folks were New Yorkers, and a York state man was never known to let tempting opportunities get away from him. They staid with the country and'ii will be a long time before the Orton family dies out in Greenbush. Mr. Orton can remember when ttiere was not much to Princeton, other than Sam Ross' "ho- tel" and few loggers. As the country took on the airs of an advanced civili zation Mr. Orton went to farming and has now 180 acres of good farming land in section 23, being located in the northeast part of the section and on edge of the timber. He is no one-crop farmer and raises besides grain and potatoes a lot of good live stock, win tering sixty head, mostly grade Dur hams. Mr. Orton believes in good stock. He says that the Red Polled with a little of the Cruiksbank blood makes a good milker but thinks that the Polled Angus,*while hardy and a fine animal, is not the animal for dairy purposes. He also thinks that the Red mixed with the Gruikshank strain makes good market color which counts for a good deal where farmers intend to sell their cattle. The potato is making inroads on other crops in his section of the country and is netting farmers ffood profits. He places the yield at about 200 bushels per acre in his sec tion. Wheat yielded 20 to 25 bushels, and oats 40 bushels and upward. In corn production some great improve ments are noted and the land proves to be very productive in the raising of that crop. Mr. Orton says that his own corn will go 45 to 50 bushels (shelled) to the acre. He has found that by mixing the yellow with the white dent that he gets acorn that will mature a little earlier, though at some sacrifice in the firmness of the kernel. The UNION would suggest that it be informed of coming nuptial events by some friends or relatives of the con tracting parties. Remember that any matters of this nature confided to the UNION will be kept inviolate, and par ties need not be afraid of any abuse of confidence. But they should remem ber that the open record at the clerk of court's office is not sufficient to enable the reporter of this or any other paper to find at all times the continued chap ters in this drama of life. In the absence of the desired information, it is quite ofter the case that news papers will "catch at straws," and in doing so are apt to say things that the expectant ones take exceptions to. Remember that attaches of this paper are not mind readers, clairvoyants or hypnotists, nor are they possessed of any occult powers, and the best way to get along with a newspaper is to be communicative and confidential. In other words, don't be a clam and then expect to read a history of the world in each issue of the paper that comes out. 'A*** Church Topics .j. .j. .j. Sunday and Weekday Announcements. t- METHODIST. The Ladies' Aid met with Mrs. E. D. Claggett Wednesday afternoon.-' A short song service will precede the regular evening preaching service.

Presiding Elder Robt. Forbes visited Princeton and adjoining churches last Sunday and Monday, and was warmly welcomed as he always is at quarterly conference time. Dr. Forbes preached at Cambridge Friday night, Isanti Sat urday night, Spencer Brook Sunday morning, Wyanett Sunday afternoon, Princeton Sunday evening and Green bush Monday evening. Rev. Robt. C. Johnson accompanied him from Cam bridge. At the services here Sunday evening Dr. Forbes preached from Isaiah 6-8: "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, here am I send me." It was the prophet's vision of the Lord's glory. Dr. Forbes delivered one of his char acteristic sermons that are rich in plain, practical applications and which all delight to listen to. Following the sermon the business meeting of the conference was held. 

CONGREGATIONAL. The Dorcas society met with Mrs. Tarbox yesterday afternoon. Sunday topic, morning: "The High Calling." Evening: "The Food of the World." Indians and Railroads. D. H. Robbins of Vineland was down Monday, this being his first visit to Princeton since the smallpox outbreak at the lake. Mr. Robbins was present when the Indians were paid off last weeK, and says each Indian received as annuity the sum of $6.25. The reg ular annuity was a little over $7, but the cost of the new blankets and clothes for the Indians was deducted from the money due the Chippewas. He says it was a sight to see the cleansing of the Indians at the time the quarantine was raised. They were all made to take a bath in a strong solution of carbolic acid and water, and every vestige of apparel, blankets, etc., was destroyed, the Indians receiving in return anew outfit of clothing. Mr. Robbins says that there have been parties at the lake from Little Falls, representing the Little Falls electric line the Westinghouse people at Little Falls intend to construct to the lake. They will develop 2,000 horse power at Little Falls and cal culate to run a train of electric cars from that place to the lake in an hour. The route the company will use from Little Falls to the lake will require very little grading and but one small cut will have to be made. The com pany will use seventy-pound rails and make the road standard guage. "In a conversation with Hon. A. F. Ferris of Brainerd, who was at the lake re cently, and who is one of the directors of the Brainerd & Northern railroad," said Mr. Robbins "I was informed that at the time the Brainerd & Northern was absorbed by the Northern Pacific that the latter road agreed to construct a line to the lake, and it may be that some of these days we will get a branch from Brainerd." Referring to the matter of the re moval of the Indians from the Mille Lacs lake country, Mr. Robbins said that there was no question but what the Indians would consent to go, pro vided that a final treaty or compact could be made with them whereby the government would make a final settle ment in cash as a recompense for all the qtleer and mysterious pieces of legislation that have been enacted in relation to the Mille Lacs Indians, and provided that the government would guarantee them a tract of land somewhere in the north where there was woodland and lakes. "The Mille Lacs Indians," said Mr. Robbins, "will never consent to go to White Earth which is a prairie country." During the recent outbreak of small pox Mr. Robbins says that there were seventeen Indians who died with the disease. Of this number thirteen were children. This was what the roll call on pay day revealed. Notice. To whom it may concern: This is to give notice that I have this day given my son, Jess Grant, his time, and will hereafter claim none of the wages of his earning or be responsible for debts contracted by him.
