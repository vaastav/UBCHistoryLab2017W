Washington, Dec 7. Congress is once more In session and ready to do busi ness, or will be by the time this dis patch is read by the public The two houses convened this noon tn the time-honored manner, the hour or so previous to the fall of the presiding officers' ravels, showing the floors of the two chambers scattered over with groups of congressmen greeting each other, talking politics, or speculating on what would be said in the presi dent's message about Cuba or the finances, and what would be done by this session of congress with reference to the tariff, the money question or the pleas of the Cuban rebels for the as sistance of Uncle Sam. Little To Be Done This Week. Vice President Stevenson, with a rap of the gavel, called the senate to order at noon today. The first day of the ses sion will be devoted almost entirely to receiving the president's message, pro vided it is sent in today, as it is gener ally conceded that it will be. Immedi ately after the opening prayer a com mittee was appointed to notify the president and the house of representa tives that the senate was organized end ready to receive communications and proceed with business. The first week of the session is not expected to be productive of any important results In a legislative way. There are many senators who think nothing should be done beyond the passage of the appro priation hills at .this session, and as these measures necessarily originate In the house there will be a disposition to postpone the season of activity until some of these bills can be received from the other end of the Capitol. There Ia Plenty of Work'Ready. The probabilities are that the daily sessions at the beginning will be com paratively brief, and that the senate will contentitself with four days' work each week. The calendar presents a wide range of material for consideration in case the senate shows a disposition to busy Itself. In this Is Included the im migration bill, which is the unfinished business; the Pacific railroad refunding bill, the statehood bills and the Dingley tariff and bond bills, as well as the Cuban and Hawaiian questions. Sen ators Lodge and Chandler have an nounced their determination to press the immigration bill to a vote as speedi ly as they can. It will be the first regu lar business to be taken up, and cannot be displced except by vote or unani mous consent. They hope to get the bill through before the holidays. Tariir WU1 Walt oa a Caacaa. It is also possible that the president's message may suggest subjects for speeches, and there are those who pre dict that the Cuban question will re ceive vigorous attention from the be ginning of the session. It is generally agreed that the Republicans will hold a caucus to determine upon a line of policy, especially with reference to the tariff, and until after the exchange of views which this conference will per mit no step Is likely to be taken which will commit the party to any position on any question of political significance. 

HOCSE LIKELY TO PUSH BUSINESS. Appopriationa Have the RIglit-of-Way, and Two of Them Are Ready. The opening week promises to aee the house put its shoulder to the wheel of the regular appropriation bills. Chair man Cannon and the committee on ap propriations were at work all last week, and it Is their eanest Intention to pass two and possible three of the bills be fore the Christmas holdays. The pen sion and legislative appropriation bills are about ready, and work on one or the other of these will be begun In the house before the week closes. The pen sion bill, although It carries a larger amount of money than any of the oth er supply bills, la very brief, and unless some political discussion Is precipitated Is not likely to consume much time In Its consideration. Beyond these two bills nothing Is in sight at present. It is. of course, not unlikely that the com mittee on rules will provide something for the house to do In case the commit' tee on appropriations is not prepared to go ahead with either of these appro priation bills. The course of the legislation, so far as the important measures on the calen dar Is concerned (like the Pacific rail road funding bill, the Nicaragua canal bill, etc), will be determined entirely by the rules committee. But it Is safe to assume that nothing will be allowed to block the appropriation bills as they are reported for action. They always have the-right-of-way at the short ses sion. Today will probably be devoted entirely to the reading- of the presi dent's message. OX THE ETE OF THE SESSION. Influx of Statenaea at the Hotel BUrk Haaaa the Central Figaro. That last night was the eve of a new session of congress was apparent in the Washington hotels, which are always barometers of political activity under the dome. Senators and members com ing to the city by every train, rein forced by the attaches and lookers-on of congress, were drifting Into the lob bies, greeting one another like school boys after a vacation with much hand shaking, with reminiscences of the campaign and many explanations of how their re-elections or defeats had been brought about. There was com paratively small interest In the work of the coming congress itself apart from the president's message, but clouds of speculation were afloat dealing with, the policies of the new administration to be Inaugurated oa the 4th of March, and with the personnel of the cabinet. It was unanimously conceded that the Republican programme was to Ig nore the Dingley tariff bill and to aum- the 15th cf March, fir the purpose' of pavfuig a new tariff mc-avure. Curios ity vas expressed over what reference If any I iesident Cleveland rr.ir.ht make to the rssu s and the result of the pres idential campaign, and particularly as to Ms policy U,n tbe Cuban question. The central figure of the night was Marcus A. Hanna. who is looked upon here as the advance agent of the Mc Klnley administration, with a commis sion to feel the pulse of congress and to communicate the policy of the president-elect to the leaders. When Han na appeared in the Arlington lobby after his dinner, accompanied by H. C. Payne, of Wisconsin, who is slated as a cabinet probability; C. J. Dawes, of Chicago, a member of the republi can committee, and General Horace Porter, the marshal of the Inauguration parade, the party was urrnund4 by congressmen and other politicians who escorted them to Hanna's rooms. The Republican chairman had been Invisi ble during the day. trying to put aside politics for a Sunday, he explained, but throughout the evening he was beset by visitors. Some of the most conspicuous men about the hotel, most of whom talked with Hanna during the evening. ren Senatms Piatt, of Connecticut, and Aldrk-h. of Rhode Island: Chairman Itabcock end Vice Chairman Mercer. of the coiifTTvsl.inal campaign com mittee; General Grcsvenor. of Ohio; Congressmen I-hci y of Iowa).

The chief purpose of his visit, to make pre liminary arrangements for the Inaugu ration ceremonies, was dropped over Sunday, and -the local politicians inter ested in the matter were not in evi dence. Regarding the position of chair man of the inauguration committee. which has been tendered to S. W. W od- ward, a prominent business man of the city, Payne said: "Mr. Woodward will give a definite answer tomorrow. He fears that the duties of the posi tion would take more time than he could spare from his business. Payne said emphatically that Woodward's hesitation was not inspired by the ob jections made against him by local Re publicans on the ground that he ia a gold Democrat. Interest In the affairs of the Hawaiian republic has been rekindled by the din ner which was given Saturday night by ex-Secretary of State John W. Foster to Hanna. The guests, who numbered a dozen. Included the Hawaiian minis ter of foreign affairs. Cooper. Minister Hatch and Secretary Hastings, of the Hawaiian legation, and Senators Mor gan, liale and Lodge, who are advo cates of annexation. It is believed that the movement for annexation Is to be brought forward again with the ad vent of the next administration. 

GERMAN GOVERNMENT PROTESTS. Doesn't Like the President's Proclamation Impoalng Tonnage Dntire. Washington, Dec. 7. Tho German government has lodged an energetic protest with the state department against the action of the president In Imposing tonnage duties on German ships entering American ports. The re ceipt of this protest will be duly ac knowledged, but there the matter Is likely to reft unless the German gov eminent ttl;es stops to remove the charges on American shli-ping which formed the basis fur the president's proclamation. The contention of the German government Is that it does not tax Amerlenn hlping, and that the ImiMTlal government cannot lo held accountable for the lmKisitlon of local charges by provincial government ofu cials. The contention of our government Is that regardless of the puestlon of who Is responsible for the levying of the port dues their collection from American vessels Is the only fact necessary to be establish d to put In operation at once the Dingley law Imposing tonnage dues on foreign vessels: that the law Is self operative, and once the president Is sat isfied that port charges of any charac ter are Imposed on American ships by a foreign government he must croclalm the fact, thus setting the law in force. 

I'NCTLK SAM'S NATAL PROGRESS. Marked Increase In It Strength Daring the Past Three Year. Washington, Dec. 7. The annual re port of Hilary A. Herbert, secretary of the navy, calls attention to the fact that In his last report he had stated that at that tithe the United States had not a single war vessel that could keep seas against a first-class vessel of any Important power. On June 30, 1S33. there were thirty vessels in commission with a tonnage of (2.820; on June 30. 1836, there were forty with a tonnage of tons, and with the Brooklyn and Puritan now in commission the number Is forty-two with a tonnage of 13.RS. The Increase In the number of those serving in tbe navy was about Z.000 during the same time. Now also we have ships that tan hold the seas with those of any pouer In the world. The secretary takes ground in favor of more battleships rather than more cruisers. Illinois P. M.a Rein to Vacate. Washington. Dec. 7. The postmasters at Waukegan, Illinois and Evanton, Ills., recently removed by the president. have refused to yield their offices to their successors. Their action la based on a determination to continue In charge until their successors can pro duce their commissions. The d-psrt ment was advised of th.-ir refusal and an Inspector was ordered to assume charge of each office. Since then It is learned that the transfer at Waukegan was proca-ding quietly.
