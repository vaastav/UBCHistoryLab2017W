This Ih particularly truo In the railroad shops. On the- other1 hand, plants like the Tredegar Ironl Works, the Hiclimond Cedar Works and; others are working full time, and with a full force. Tho former plant ls> working tho 'largest number of men It ho* employed in a decade. General trado conditions throughout | the country were disturbed by tho eud-| den outbreak .of hostilities In Europe. j In many instances the closing of the, stock exchanges and tho upheaval of business dealings causo,l big conccrna Immediately to curtail their forces, and in sora6 cases to close down. Tho rc ? at big orders from" tho warring natlohti ltau caused factoriesi.ln..;ipawy lines to resume on full time, and some are even working overtlmo.

CEDAK WOI1KS IS iir.wi.vt; rrr.L hIjAST T. Kirkpatriok 1'nrrleh, secretary of t)ie Ilichmond Ci'iar Works, said last night that tho big woodworking plant was running full time, with approxi mately a foil force of employes. There are between 900 and 1,000 operatives on the pay roll, he stated. Several months ago the plant was put on a four-day basJt-, in order - to hold its employes together, hut recent orders have made !i practicable to resume full time. "I do not know how long this will last," said Mr. Parrlah last night, "but at present we are working full blast. Our whole fore- is putting in a six flay week." From a representative of the Trede gar Iron Works was received the in formation that the plant was running day and night in so:v< department?, while other* were running normal, it has developed recently that the com pany was forced to decline orders for shells from European governments on account of big contracts with the United States government, which will keep the plant running for months to come. "We have nearly 1,500 men em ployed," stated an olllenr last night. As far as 1 can remember, this is tho largest forcts of men we have had in the papt ton years. There is no way of. tolling how long this will continue, but tho outlook for the future is bright. Our railroad department lias suffered, but other departments have tnado up tho defioicncy." ii0C0>i(VrivK wohks 1*1,AXS l.AIUiKIt Ol'TlM'T To counteract this cheering piece ofj news was the statement that the Amerl-; can Locomotive Works, which aoinu-, times employs as many as 3,".00 miiij was entirely closed. This condition, however, lias occurred periodically, and { at1 the plant has not been running atj Its normal capacity for several years, probably less than half of that num ber are out of employment on account! of its idleness. The company, on the I other hand, has recently expended $70,-1 000 in the erection of u new forging shop, and when orders arc received, it will bo in a position to rpsumo opera tions speedily, and under better work ing conditions than heretofore. Another plant that has suffered by the war is the Export Leaf Tobacco Company. This factory was luird lilt by the Interruption of commerce with tlie warring nations, and hundreds of operatives, the majority either young girls or negroes, were thrown out of employment, other tobacco factories, if .the figures of the Internal Itcvcnun I Department can lie used as an indica-; lion, are turnings out as much as they did la$t year, and presumably are >vor Ic ing At full capacity. Many of tho op eratives from the one idle plant have beon taken on by the others. Samuel T.

Tho measure that wan paacid was offered by Councilman Gilbert K. I'ol j lock as a substitute for the ordinance Introduced by Councilman Carter C. Jones and reported in an amended form by the Finance Committee. It was accepted by Councilman Jones, and was adopted after a running- debate that lasted more than an hour. In the ordinance reported by the Fi nance Committee tho .<125.000 was par- j ! celed out to the reven departments in I | definite sums, as follows: streets gen- j erally. 530,000: grounds and parks, $20.- ' 000; str set cleaning, $30,000; Water i Workr, $10,000; Oa:i Workt, 510,000; cemeteries, ? 15,000, and electric pl,-?nt, I J 10,000. I I l'Olil,OClt OPPOSES UICT.VI'IOX TO noAllD Councilman Pollock entered vigorous ? objection t-i the ordinance because it j undertook to dictate to the Adminis trative Hoard the amount, that shall be spent In each department. Such a pro eoedlriGr, he held, was, on its fao.j im practicable and would hamper the board in giving early employment to tho turnout number. Tho board, bo ; said, should be left free to spend the money where It was mont needed, and l where It could bo spent to tho best ad vantage. Air. Pollock objected also to the pro vision of tho ordinance limiting- the wage to be paid to $2 a day. It would bo altogether inconsistent, ho held, for tho city to pay one man $2 a day and another man $3 a day for' identically tho earn* work, merely because. one rarce ntuT the oilier to {he provisional or emergency force. It was not a ques tion of charity, he paid, but o:io of I paying the laborer regular wage* for^ | useful work. i It wan idle for the city to promiso to ; employ TOO men when the whole pres I ent army of city employes numbers j little more than 000. said Mr. Pollock. The practicable thing to do, lie urged, was to give the Administrative Bjard frco rein, authorizing It to employ as many men as can advantageously be employed. The board, Knowing tlio ob ject of the appropriation, he thought, would of Its own accord do its utmost ; to employ as many mon as possible. OFFEHS SUBSTITUTE POIl FINANCE HEPOllT Ifoldiivg these views. Mr. Pollock offered a substitute for tho paper re ported by the Kinunco Committee, ap propriating $125,000 In a lump sum without .restrictions as to the manner in which It shall be spent. The money, ; tho substitute provides, shall be placed to the credit of nil account to be known as tho "Special Improvement* Account," to be expended by the Administrative Board In public improvements upon I vouchers Issued by the several depart mcnis. Councilman Jones declined at first' to accept the substitute, asking instead j that the Council pass the original ordi nance introduced . by him, which pro vided for the employment of at least 700 men nt 52 a day. The Pollock sub stltute, he feared, might leave the way open for cheap contract labor and de feat the intention to Rive employment to day laborers at a reasonable wage. In order to meet this objection Mr. J Pollock added a provision to his sub- j stRule, directing that all work under t.he special appropriation be done by^j per diem employee. With this amend- j im-nt Councilman Jones accepted the i substitute, and it was put to a vote and uuanlmously passed. The measure I will come-up for concurrence at tho meeting of the Hoard of Aldermen next j Tuesday night. I WAS JIASKD O.Y IlKl'OHT PROM AOMIMST1IATIVK UOARD ! The Finance Committee's ordinance ! apportioning the appropriation among j the several departments, was baaed on | a report made to the committee yester day afternoon by the Administrative Hoard, ln*wblch a tentative apportion ment was described. Tho division, however, was made by tho board mere ly to indicate tho probablo rnannor in which money would be spent, the re port recommending specifically that the appropriation be made In a lump sum. In its report to the finance Com mittee the board drew attention to the fuel that approximately one-third of the $125,000 appropriation would have to be expended for tools, equipment.arid materials. It was estimated that even with this expenditure for materials and equipment, the bain nee remaining would make possible the employment j of .700 men for two mouths. Tho board reported Its belief that It 1 would bo greatly embarrassed if com- j polled tj/. employ at once as many aa j 70o men, to, be designated as, and u> | du the work of, day laborers, aa it | would have been required to do tindor the original ordinance. It asked leave to be allowed to employ men from time to time, as needed. With large additions to tho laboring army, It was necessary also, It was pointed out, to employ at least a limited number of skilled men as supervisors, and for work demanding skilled service. Under the amended measure that was passed, no definite wage la fixed, and the board will have the power to employ any class of labor at any rate of com pensation that it deems equitable. !

At Sandy Hook, the wind attained a velocity of sixty-eight miles an hour, driving in a record-breaking tide and making it impossible for pilots to board incoming vessels.

Fifteen buildings along Coney Island had been damaged to-night, including j big- bathing pavilions and summer cot ! tages. j At Brighton Beach the boardwalk was demolished, and much of-the stone breakwater was torn away. The waves surged arour.d the Brighton Beach Ho tel and wrecked several small build ings, although the hotel itself escaped serious damage. 1 Waves broke more than twenty-five feet over the high tide line at Hock-| ' away "Bench, causing heavy damages to' bungalows, baths' and boardwalks. At!

At Harrison and at East Newark, scores of houses and factories were flooded. New York bay and harbor were prac tlcally cleared of all craft by the gal''. One tircboat was sunk at her pier. Ok the New Jersey shore the big waitins room of the Lackawanna terminal was flooded, and fioarly all ferries discon tinued. Along the coast o? New England, the gale was especially violent. At Point Judith, U. I., a small schooner was torn from her anchorage and thrown on the breakwater.
