Plans now initiated for prepara tion of national defense "contem plate a more complete state of pre paredness than at any previous pe riod in the peace-time history of our country," Secretary of War Weeks declares in his arfnual re port just published. The plan for comrlete defense provides for an initial mobilization jof 2.000.000 men. organized into six , field armies, he says.

He characterizes the present pe ; riod. marking the transition of the army from a war to a peace basis as "one of the most important in our history."

"For the first time," he declares, , "The American people had ex i pressed, in the form of a definite I sanction, a determination to con 1 stltute a permanent military policy ,ruinnunsurate with their great pe t'-ntial requirements for national J defense, and yet thoroughly con ! sist^nt with their national tradi ; tions."

They are ready to meet thi Briti>h opposition. Admiral Ferdi nand De Hon, rhief of the naval staff, simply says that his figures arc workable*. He has rested bis case in the hands of M. Viviani.

But they ask why. when that is their attitude, they should be kept waiting outside of the general scope of the negotiations. , Land armai*fnts can wait, these delegations say. But they feel that because they have accepted that position there is no real reason why they should be penalized because they believe that I they have the right to protect their coital system President Predicts Success Beyond Fondest Hopes Tells Farmers and Red Cross He Believes Arms Conference Will Aid in Preventing All Wars in Future.
