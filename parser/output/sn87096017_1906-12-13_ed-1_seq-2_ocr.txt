SUBSTAN­ TIALLY RECOGNIZED. SECURES $40,000 OF NOBEL BEQUEST WILL U8E MONEY TO E8TABLI8H INDUSTRIAL PEACE COMMIT­ TEE AT WASHINGTON. Ctarlstlanla, Norway, Dee. 11.—The Norwegian parliament has conferred the Nobel peace prize upon President Roosevelt In recognition of his serv ices In ending the Russo-Japanese war. Candidates for this distinction must be proposed by legislative bodies, peace organizations or universities. It Is understood that the president's sponsors were Professor H. P. Judson, acting president of Chicago univer sity Professor Baldwin of Yale, Pro fessor Harberger of the University of Munich and the faculty of Georgetown university, Washington. The American minister, Mr. Pelrce, In an eloquent speech, thanked parlia ment in the president's name. He said that words were Inadequate to express the deep emotion which he experienced at receiving this distin guished testimonial in behalf of the president, who recently cabled that he regarded this prize as one of the great est honors which any man In any position throughout the world could receive. The award, Mr. Peirce add ed, would deeply appeal to the hearts of the American people. Mr. Pelrce then read a message from President Roosevelt expressing his deep thanks and saying there was no gift he could appreciate more. The president also announced that he had concluded to use the prize to establish at Washing ton a permanent industrial peace com mittee with the view of maintaining righteous peace In the industrial world, which was as important as the maintenance of peace in the world of nations. The following is the text of President Roosevelt's dispatch: Gratified by Honor Shown Him. "I am profoundly gratified and touched by the signal honor shown me through your body in conferring on me the Nobel peace prize. There is no gift I could appreciate more and 1 wish it were in my power to fully ex press my gratitude. I thank you for it and I thank you in behalf of the United States, for what I did I was able to accomplish only as the repre sentative of the nation of which for the time being I am president. After much thought I have concluded that the best and most fitting way to ap ply the amount of the prize is by us ing it as a fund to establish at Wash ington a permanent industrial peace committee. The object will be to strive for better and more equitable relations among my .countrymen who are engaged, whether as capitalists or wageworkers, in Industrial and agri cultural pursuits. This will carry out the purpose of the founder of the prize, for in modern life it Is impor tant to work for the cause of just and righteous peace in the industrial world as in the world of nations." The Nobel peace prize is part of a bequest left by Dr. Alfred Bernhard Nobel, the Swedish scientist, who died in 18!)ti. By his will a large portion of his fortune was devoted to five annual prizes, each valued at about ?40,000. They were awarded for the most im portant discoveries in physics, chem istry, physiology or medicines, for the most distinguished work of an idealis tic tendency in the field of literature and for the best effort toward the fra ternity of nations and the promotion of peace. The last named is awarded by the Norwegian parliament. The others are awarded by Institutions at Stockholm.

FEDERAL GRAND JURY. High Officials of Harriman and Gould Lines Indicted. Salt Lake City, Dec. 8.—The federal grand jury that is Investigating coal land frauds in Utah and charges that railroad corporations have discrim inated against certain shippers made a partial report during the afternoon. Indictments were returned against the Union Pacific Railroad company, the Oregon Short Line railroad, the Union Pacific Coal company, the Utah Fuel company and several of the high est officials representing the Harri man and Gould corporations In Utah. The Indictments charge violation of the Interstate commerce law and at tempts to defraud the government WRIT OF ERROR DENIED. Federal 8upr«me Court Will Not Hear Case of Mrs. Myora. Washington, Dec. 8.—-The supreme court of the United States, through Justice Brewer, has denied the appli cation of Mrs. Aggie Myers of Kansas City, Mo., for a writ of error, which, If It had been allowed, would have had the effect of bringing her case to that court.

Washington, Dec. 8.—Former Sena tor Arthur Brown of Utah was shot and perhaps mortally wounded late this afternoon in his room at the Raleigh hotel by Mrs. Annie Bradley of Salt Lake City. "I was fully justified In doing what I did," was the only statement Mrs. Bradley would make. Senator Brown apparently Is In a dying condition in the Emergency hos pital with a bullet wound though the stomach and another in the hand. Sev eral blocks away from the hospital Mrs. Bradley was pacing the floor of the matron's room in the police sta tion, anxiously inquiring every few minutes as to the condition of her victim. "I loved the ground he walked on," she continually remarked. Her condition at midnight was such as to render a medical examination as to her sanity necessary. As the night wore on she lost her composure and gave every indication that her reason had left her. The cause of the shooting, so far as Mrs. Bradley will say, is that Senator Brown was the father of two of her children, Arthur Brown, Jr., seven years old, and Montgomery Brown, three years old, and that he refused to marry her despite his repeated prom ises to make her his wife.

Herbet, reporter of the Algeciras con ference, and M. Pinchon, the foreign minister, had spoken the chamber passed a vote of confidence in the ministry, 457 ayes to 56 noes.

Y., Dec. 5.—The jury has pronounced Chester E. Gillette guilty of murder in the first degree in killing Grace Brown, his sweetheart. The twelve men deliberated three minutes less than five hours before they reached their verdict. Five bal lots were taken. Four resulted in eleven for conviction and one for ac qqfttal. Two hours elapsed between the fourth and .fifth ballots and during that time the men who felt sure of Gil lette's guilt argued and worked upon the one man standing against them. When the verdict was announced Gillette was the most unconcerned man in the room. He sat motionless as one after another the twelve jurors arose to their feet and declared that they were united in their decision. When the twelfth man had responded the stolid indifference or studied com posure of the boy was exhibited as never before. Leaning oyer a nearby table he wrote this message to his father in Denver: "Father: am convicted." The verdict means death in the elec tric chair.

He was gradually promoted until In 1884 he was made general manager of the Louisville and' Nashville system. In the next few years he held several dif ferent positions, and one of these was that of general manager of the Chesa peake and Ohio railroad. He made a good move in his acceptance of the post of general manager of the Louis ville, New Orleans and Texas railroad, for under his direction the possibilities of the line became so apparent that he was able to negotiate the sale of it to the Illinois Central. The result of this deal was his elevation in 1900 to be second vice president of the latter company.
