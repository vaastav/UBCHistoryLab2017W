THE DAILY EVENING TELEGRAPH PHILADELPHIA, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1870. crxnxT or run rzinsfl. Editorial Opinions of the Leading Journal upon Current Topio Compiled Every x Day for the Evsiing Telegraph CONGIIE43 AT WitlC AGAIN1. From the A. Y. Hernia. On yesterday, under fair aiupeoies for the weather vas ulaud atut lieaiiuful nil iu Sep tember and with a full atteudance of iu em bers, tho third or fMuvt eioa of the Forty, first CoQgreHS of the United State wai opened. J!oth boiwe.i wore called to order precisely at uoon, ia the presence of un usual throngs of apeotator, and with an evi dence of interest on the p.irt of both mem bers and public that a inured well for the work to be done. Thut this work is not likely to be idly deferred Air. Sumner dii tinctly indicated in the Senate by introduo ing a financial bill to promote and facilitate A return to specie payments by gradual and natural processes, consistent with the exi gencies of the Government and the business of the country. The bill itself we ahull have abetter opportunity of disc us ing after the organization of the standing committees, to which it will in due coarse be referred. Hat wo are glad to Bee that the subject before the country which is the most prominent, important, and pressing, is thus insured the earliest consideration. The re peal of the income tax after the 1st of Janu ary next was also put ut once into the fore ground by the bills of Messrs. Cole and Cas herly, of California, who, representing both parties, as they do, are agreed upon the ne cessity of removing a burthen whish cripples the enterprise of their young Commonwealth notwithstanding all its vigor and resouroo.s. A few bills of less import, but all looking like eatnefet business, completed the day's work for the upper chamber. The House of Representatives, also, had a gonial and pleasant meeting, and after hear ing the President's Message read, referring the report of the Secretary of the Treasury and passing a bill the first, therefore, of the session to supply an omission in the latest Indian Appropriation bill, adjourned at. P. AI. Thus the new session is fairly launched, without any sign of collision or unpleasant ness iu any direction, and we sincerely trust that the good humor of the first day may con tinue to its last. The amount of business accumulated and craving performance is heavy, but with a full Oougress few, if any, of those whose seats are now vacant, and the earnest good intent that enould now auimito all parties and the representatives of all sec tions, the task is easy enough for patriotism and statesmanship. The contrast atTordei by the condition of our great country and that of distracted Europe should impress itself upon our legislators, and nerve them to the labor that still remains to be done ere we can consider our prosperity consolidated and our future seouie. The nation begins to feel fresh life in all its veins; its monstrous losses by civil war are being rapidly made good; its wounds are healing; its numbers and wealth in creasiug with fabulous rapidity, while, as the message of our Chief Magistrate reminds us, a bounteous Providence has ever blessed us, "our basket and our store." A moral duty of the highest order devolves upon us, then, not only to profit by these advantages ourselves but to Bet the example of their proper usu iruci 10 omer nations, xnere tmouid be in telligence enough in the American Congress to comprehend its high mission, and we await its performance at this -critical and eventful time with earnest confidence. 

PARISIAN NEW YORK. From tkr X. Y. Tribune. There are always compensations. The world has lost Paris, but fashionable New York asserts itself as quite ready to take the vacant place. The king is dead; it is not worth while to say that, take him for all in all, we shall not look upon his like again; let us make baste to shout "Vive le Roi," and not inquire too closely into either birth or breeding of the bastard claimant. It was only the other day that the world was sur prised by discovering this blood relationship, which it now appears has long existed be tween the ton of Fifth avenue and moribund Paris. When the French Fair was opened, all Japonicadom rushed in a vertigo of en thusiasm to its support; it turned its back upon private views and pnblio concerts; upon art, musio, and pleasure; put on the weeds of grief and stretched out its arms to suffering Franco, refusing to be com forted, tiuch devotion and sorrow for the far-off dead and dying touched and surprised everybody; it was clear, in spite of the old prejudice to the contrary, that fashionable people had hearts to feel and brains that could understand. Hut some kind souls to whom a suffering fellow creature, whether French or German, was only a brother who needed help, had started a fair for the relief of the Prussian wounded. To their astonisU meut, fashionable New York coldly ignored this, shut its eyes, buttoned up its pockets. It had nothing in common with plebeian death or pain; its tears and its dollars, it seems, flow only in remembrance of past glimpses of the Taileries of dear departed Worth. "I kuow nothing of the war," said an ex grocer; "we belong to the class who do not vote. Republics are plebeian." This is the class who mourn for Paris, and assume to represent her. Success to their endeavor. Hut there are few of us who will believe the lion a real lion. W'e all know too well the features of Snug the Joiner. "I care nothing about this war," said, the wife of an ex-grocer, "since that dreadful mistake of declaring a republic. Before that my sympathies were all with the French; but now could tney ue miotic- enougu to try so pUbiau a thing as a republic ? If they had our eipeiience they would have have known better." This is the class who mourn for I'm is and assume to represent her. THE CUBANS CAN FREE CUBA. Pram tk H. T. Sun. The Ttibune, in discussing the temporary appointment of General Yalmaseda to be Captain-General of Cuba, made a sur prising statement. "The insurrection, ' aid the Tribune, "has shown but too plainly its inability to achieve the independence of the inland. " So far from this being a fair de duction from the events 01 the past twenty gii months in uuds, me exact opposite is true. If the ultimate result of any war de pen J upon the relative strength of the forces engaged after two years' fighting, it is clear that the decrease of the strength of Spain and the increase in that of the patriots must at no distant day result in the complete victory of the latter. QTwo years ago Spain attempted, with a force ut' over thirty Ave thousand well drilled aud admirably equipped soldiers, to fsubdii a stuall body of poorly armed Cubans, not ex- ettdiu' thirty five hundred in number. She failed. A year ag by fresh reinforcements received from the Peninsula, and by the mo bilization of some thirty thousand volunteers, fcbe was enabled to employ in active service in the field not less than forty-live thousand men against the p.ttriot forces, which at that dal bad increns-ed to some nine thousand armed men. She ngnin signally failed. To day, including the live tho'isaud iuoti mostly jail-birds and raw recruits with whom she bas of late reinforred her exhausted army, sbo cannot count fifteen thousnud regulars in Cuba, while the patriots possess at the pro sent moment an army of at least thirteen thousand well armed men, so iuured to hard- fillip, fatigue, and lighting, as to be more than a match, in their own countty, for thrice the number of their enemies. Again, it is well known that Spain has offered autonomy to the Cubans, although the 1 ribti u e possibly for the support of its erroneous deduction pretends to ignire the fact. Now, after having strained every nerve and sacrificed every fooling of humanity in the relentless prosecution of a war which she aDd her satellites in Cuba have waged confessedly for the extermination of the Cuban race, Bhe would hardly have offered them autonomy if in her judgment the in surrection had shown "its iuability to achieve the independence of the island. If, in a jonrnalist speaking of our war of independence una indulged ia a strain of prophecy similar to that of the Tribune, he would have been more justified than the Tribune is, both by antecedents and by the then relative strength and positions of tbe American and British forces. And if we recall the duration of the revolutionary wars by which the liberating armies of all the republics of Central and South America achieved their independence, that of Cuba has exceeded them all in the amount of ter ritory occupied, in the losses inflicted on the enemy, and in the generally satisfactory re sults obtained within a comparatively short period of time. PORTER UPON PORTER. From tkeif. Y. World. We really do not know in what words to describe the extraordinary communication from Admiral Porter to the President. To say thut the Admiral has succeeded in per forming the apparently impossible feat of kicking himself down stairs is to put the feat iu the most kindly and considerate terms at all compatible with truth. He states that he considers as a "fabrication" a letter which he admits himself to have writ ten; explains how he was led, by a storm at sea, a light at Fort Fisher, and the general excitement of "a nation which dreaded a defeat that might prolong a contest that was already sapping Us vitals," to utter sonti- ments which were "at variance with all he had uniformly expressed towards General Grant," and "docs not hesitate to disapprove the sentiments of which he supposes he must bear the odium." In other words, he appeaU from Porter fighting before Fort Fisher for a permanent position to Porter enjoying that position at Washington and fondly believing it. permanent. Whether President Grant, who hassoleninly announced himsell to nave "lost his faith in human nature" since he read the letter which bas provoked this unparalleled Palinode, will regain that invaluable possession upon pe rusing it, we cannot pretend to guess. Wo incline, however, with the languid and philo sophical Mr. Toots, in whose spirit Admiral Porter sits in judgment upon himself, his correspondence, his sentiments, and his ties, to believe that, alter all, it "dont much signify." Before this publication there were not a few people in the United States who impiously thought rather Biviall beer of Ad miral Porter. Now that Admiral Porter ad vertises himself as being of the same mind, we may look for a happy unanimity upon at least one great question of the day. THE 

HOUR OF DANGER. Vow tlt London Saturday lleuiew. There can be no doubt that England is now passing through the most dangerous hour which she has been called upon to traverse since the downfall of the 1' irst Napoleon Fortunately there is one ray of light in the midst of the gloom. The danger has come upon us in such a form that there is no Uivi sicn of opinion. England cau act without hesitation, and without contests of parties or balancing of opposing arguments. The spi rited reply of Lord Ganville to Prince Gort schaKon s insolent circular is the reply ot a Cubinet of which Mr. Bright is a member. If Russia wants to know the mind of England, she may know it at once. England, if chal lenged by a direct, deliberate insult, means prompt, earnest, resolute fighting. But although there cannot be the slightest shade of doubt as to the attitude wnicn England ougnt to as sume, there is no use in attempting to conceal from ourselves the extreme gravity of tbe situation. Immediately after the capitulation of Metz, Russia, thinking France finally and irretrievably stricken down, sent off a notice to the ally of France in the Crimean war that the Treaty of Paris was to be wholly set aside, and that the blood and treasure lavished by 1 ranee and England were held to have been lavished in vain. But this is not all; it is only a vero small part of what England has to face. Russia would not venture to provoke England if Russia could count on no allies. She must either have had an understanding with other powers or have calculated that other allies would be in ev it ably drawn to her side if she stepped for ward and gave the signal lor a general war, 1 he allies on whose assistance she counted were of course Germany and the United States. If she gained the aid of both, then, with France prostrate, all the help that the rest cf the civilied world could bring to England would be of comparatively slight avail. Austria, Italy, possibly Spain, possibly the tiny Scandinavian powers. would, with Turkey, do what they could to mace me contest not a hopeless one. But it is a black prospect, the blackness ot which we realize, aitnougu we do not think that there is an Englishman who would heritate, if need be, to encounter it. "Happy England," said the author of the famous article in the Edinburgh. "Happy England; What Happiness: Russia throw ing the gauntlet iu our face; the United States longing to launch the Alabamas of the New World to redress the balance of the Old; Ireland burning to exchange sedition for re bellion; and Count Bismarck goading on his countrymen into quarrelling with Englaud for furnishing France with a twentieth part of tbe arms furnished by America without comment or objection. Happy England! harpy In mx security, and iu the foresight end judgment of her Premier. At the same time, while the very first duty of Englishmen at this moment is to see how great the dan gor is and to resolve to meet it, we need not exaggerate anything, or impute evil to others before we are sure of its existence. We are certain that there is a very large section of the German people who would bitterly de plore seeing themselves opposed to England when England is striving to do nothing but to uphold tbe pnblio law of Europe. In the United States there are many who would fthririk from quarrelling with England, Rim ply to hurt ber, because she was involved in a contet-t where the right was indisputably on her side. In Ireland there are Irishmen, let us hope, who have been won over by the liberal and just policy of England in the last two sessions. Even Russia may hesitate to Make ber fortnne on the practical Assertion of the great doctrine that henceforth the most solemn engagements of nations are to be set aside at tho caprice of any party to a treaty. Justice and common sense may still triumph, although what we fear is that in a moment of passion those who love neither justice nor common sense may get the upper hand. THE PORTER LETTER. I i&n the Wasliinntnn Patriot. When Charles Surface pulls down the screen, and Dr. Cains opens the closet- door, we all laugh, though we know before hand exactly what will he discovered. So there is a universal cacchinatiou in the land on the exposure of Admiral Torter's letter to Secretary Welles, which has leaked or boou delved out of the Navy department. The merriment does harm to nobody. The reve lation does no particular good to anybody. Historically, it is of little value, for what will the grave mnse care when she comes to make up her solemn record, as to the bickerings of the tulkative tar and the sileut soldier t Every one familiar with military story, at home aud abroad, is aware, without Jihis new light, of tbe chronic ill feeling between the two branches of the service. It was car ried to such an extent in the English service that when, in Us the Wasp captured the Frolic, and was in turn recaptured by a line- of-bnttle ship and carried into Bermuda, the ai my officers of the garrison honored aud feasted the American prisoners because, as they frankly said, they had mortified the navy men. Nor was this after-discovered evidence needed to prove that, iu our day and genera tion, this Admiral and this General at one time bad no love for each other, or that Tor ter, with all the intensity of personal aud pro fessional ill-nature, utterly despised the groat Massachusetts militia-man. When the secrets of the War Department, in turn, come to be told, we shall doubtloss find that there was perfect reciprocity. Still leas incredible is it that hatreds, and sneers, and disparagements should melt away in the sunshine of favor and patronage as it manned from the soldier when converted into the President. There seemod to be a thaw of asperity all round. The hos- tile Generals became reconciled, the sneer of the 'bottle' was withdrawn, and why should not this condoning, conciliatory, forgetful feeling extend "beyond the water's edge" and soften the salt sailor s temper.' It did; and in the rosy season of the Borio dawn, Admi ral Porter "felt very kindly to President Grant," and when brave Farragut's death created a vacancy, was of opinion that he who had the power to till it "didwotf want magna nimity and was not avaricious of fame," whatever he may be ol houses, or lands, or watches, or ttotting horses. There is one phrase in Admiral Porter a unlucky letter which is more impressive than all bis slurs. He Bays: "When the Rebels write the history of the war, then, and only then, will the country be made to feel what the navy has done. This is not a new idea, nor is its significance limited to naval matters. It throws a dark shadow on the military re cord in the future. There is at least a ques tion whether, in future ttory, the Confederate soldiers of rank will not faro better than some of ours. They had, we all know, bickerings and jealousies and backbitings. But, acci dentally, and from the sharp necessity which pressed tbem all the time, they were com pelled to wash their dirty linen at home. With us it was very diff erent. There is an Italian proverb which says that "dirty water doesn't wash clean. lhis the Uouiiuittee on mo Conduct of tbe War painfully illustrated. The Chandler-Covode saponaceous com pound, which was bo industriously applied to our heroes, smeared them all over, aud, what makes the matter worse, our military Presi dent, who owes so much of his lucky fame to gallant subordinates, has tried to make the stains which the Congressional washerwomen left indelible. McClellan, Meade, McDowell, and others were all in turn defamed by this committee, and who now are more honored by the Executive than their special slan derers? Any other man would have done justice to Fitz John Porter. No other would have ostentatiously petted and promoted the accusers and secret slanderers ot Meade tne Sickleses, Bntterlields, and such like. If, according to Admiral Porter, the navy is to receive tardy justice only at Rebel hauda, it is not hoping against hope to have other of President Grant's false judgments reversed too. The people of the North are beginning to reverse them pretty rapidly for them selves.
