MINERS ENTOMBED. No In Hope for at Least Twenty-five Pennsylvania Mine. Fayette City, Pa., Dec. 3. -Between 25 and 30 miners, possibly more, are entombed in the Naomi mine of the United Coal company, located three miles west of this city, and there is practically no hope that any of them are alive. The imprisonment is due to an explosion of black damp about 8 o'clock Sunday night, soon after the night force went to work. It is said a miner entering an old working with an open lamp caused the explosion. Had the disaster occurred on any other nigut man sunuay me number of victims would have been twice as large. The mine employed from 275 to 300 regularly, about one fourth of them making entry at night, but on Sunday nights only about one half the night force goes to work. The mine ia of the shaft type and the con crete sides of the entry were broken down so as to close the passage back a considerable distance. About 100 feet from the entrance is located the first air shait and iroiu cms aeaaiy gas is pouring in great volume. he gas found in mines in this territory is so poisounous that no human being can live in it fcr more than a few minutes, and for this reason it is believed not a single one of the entombed men is still alive. NEWS ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST FROM THE STATE OF OREGON GIVE SPECIAL SHORT COURSES GREAT LAKE IS LOWERING. AIMS TO PLEASE ALL. SIBERIAN REBELS ACTIVE. Rumors of Battle in Which 280 Are Killed Many Arrests Made. Victoria, B. C, Dec. 3. The British steamer Port Maria, which arrived at Nagasaki shortly before the Monteagle sailed, with fugitives from v ladivostok, reported severe fighting, in which 280 had been killed or wounded, was in progress when she left and that Decern ber 12, the czar's birthday, had been fixed for the outbreak which revolu tionaries on the Port Maria said would give Vladivostok a place in Russian history. Steamer Mongolia, which also reach ed Nagasaki, brought fugitives who stated that the discovery of large quan titles of arms and explosives had been made, and plans of the fortress and rolls of revolutionists had been unearthed by secret service officers in a Vladivostok shipyard, the finding of the enrollment of the rebels being followed by hun dreds of arrests, quickly succeeded by executions. A girl of 17 was among those shct. Two Russian engineers have arrived at Vladivostok to construct barracks to accommodate twe additional divisions, and substantial increases are to be made to the Baikal forces to cope with the revolutionists. Arrivals from Habwo rovek say large forts and barracks are also being built at the mouth of the Amur. Agriculture, Horticulture, Dairying and Other Subjects at Corvallis.

Weston The stockmen of the Weston country have completed their annua) fall roundup, which has been the most successful in recent years. Cattle have come out of the mountains in fine con dition, and they have left the ranges knee deep in grass because of the favor able rulings of the forest reserve offi cials. It is thought that next year there will be a double amount of cattle on the Wenaha reserve. About 1,000 head have recently come from the mountains to the Weston country. PAPER MONEY HARMFUL.

Colorado land fraud trials will begin in Denver December 16. , Financiers Fear Evil Results Currency Tinkering. New York, Dec. 3. It is significant of the change in financial opinion that most of the discussion among financial men last week dealt with the dreaded effect of a state of inflation of the cur rency, into which it was feared the country might merge with the passage of the effects of the irrational distrust. The bringing forward of this subject into debate while the premium on cur rency was still being paid and measures were being taken to stop the famine was due to plain lessons of experience in paet crises of a similar condition. In all of these the return of confidence and the re-establishment of credit have brought a condition of actual redund ancy of the money market, a heavy ac cumulation of banking reserves and free export movement of gold. While the enormous mass of gold that has flowed into the United States n response to the urgent requirements developed by the crisis is admittedly in excess of the normal requirements of the period, the return flow of gold is bound to have an unfavorable effect on financial sentiment and in the event of its undue stimulation by any inflation by paper note issues, which would tend to force out gold, the danger of a check being administered to the recovery in commercial activity is taken anxious ac count of. Train Leaps Into Bay. San Francisco, Dec. 3. While round ing a sharp curve near Marshall, a train of the Northwestern Pacific railroad was derailed, and after running over the ties for a distance f 200 feet, dash ed down an embankment into Tomales bay, where nothing but the shallowness of the water saved the crew and passen gers from being drowned like rates in a trap. Owing to the fact that the train plunged into the muddy bottom of the bay and failed to overturn, no one was seriously injured in the accident. Sev eral were painfully bruised. Change City Government. New York, Dec. 3.

A. and the railroad officials, and will take the place of the scrip books now in use. Vast Area Will Be Added Reclamation Work In Klamath. Klamath Falls Nature is perform ing one of the most extensive portions of the reclamation work of the Klamath project, and also one of the most expen sive parts Included in the estimate, which is the drainage of Tule lake. . Reports received from J. Frank Ad ams, of Tule lake, brings intelligence that the water of the lake is rapidly lauing, and a tremendous whirlpool nas lormed just off Scorpion point mruugu wuicn me water is passing with a deafening roar that can be beard a great distance. Below is apparently a great cnannei underground through which the waters find outlet beneath the Modoc lava beds and thence through the drainage of Fall river to Pitt, and finally on to the ocean through the Sac ramento and San Francisco bay. It has long been held by geologists that luie lake has an underground out let, and that Fall river, which burets from a gushing spring in Modoc county, Cal., is the vent. Last spring the lake water reached a higher level than has ever been known since the country was settled, and bordering farms were inun dated. For several days the water has been receding and investigation reveal ed the new outlet. Should the vent en tirely drain the body of the lake, it will add 50,000 acres of irrigable land to the project and at a saving of hun dreds of thousands of dollars to the people of Klamath basin, as the in tended diversion" of Lost river will be rendered unnecessary. Fortunes in Walnuts. Ashland The black walnut thrives in the Oregon climate, particularly in Southern Oregon, above almost every other tree and becomes a tree of much commercial value within 20 years. The other day a black walnut was cut on Laurel street in this city that was planted 26 years ago. Its diameter two feet above the ground was two feet. A number of cuts were taken from it to a cabinet f hop. It is of fine grain and rich color, equal to any black walnut grown in the Mississinni vnllnv- Tha was not large cabinet maker in exhibiting this wood, taken in the pointing out the annual growth in the cross-section, said: "The young man who will plant 10 acres of black walnut trees here will find that it will make a fortune for him in 25 years." Forest Supervisor at John Day. John Day Cy J. Brighara deputy surpervisor of the Western division of the Blue mountain forest, has arrived at this place, where his headquarters will be from now on, and is preparing to take up his new duties. The estab lishment of a supervisor's office here is one of the most important concessions made local stockmen by the buerau of forestry, and it is hoped that most of the causes of friction will disappear un der his administration. President's Message is to Be a Con servative Document. Washington, Deo. 2. It is said that President Rooesvelt's annual message to congress will open with a broad and confident expression of belief In the resources of America and an appeal to the citizens to keep thier money in cir culation. It will be patriotic in tone, conserv ative without being reactionary. The message will be regarded by many as a political work of art. It reaches out to reassure and please the business man, the railroad man, the working man, the farmer, the labor agitator. The president is in favor of currency legislation. He would have provision made for the issuance by the banks of an emergency currency, safely secured by good bonds, which should be taxed enough to make it unprofitable to con tinue its use after the emergency had passed. The president is in favor of legiela tion that will give the railroads a chance to live. He would have the Sherman anti-trust law amended. It should be changed so as to permit cer tain very proper combinations, neces sary to industrial progress, and also made to prevent other combinations that are opposed to the public interest Mr. Roosevelt thinks the tariff should be revised at proper periods, but noth ing is to be done in that direction with his consent until the next presidential election. He looks with favor on the proposal to remove the tax on print paper and pulp, but only conditioned on the Canadian government permitting its pulp wood to enter the United States free of an export tax. Though be wants the condition of the women and children who work in factories improved, he wants more in vest igat ion cf the subject. So, too, the president wants technical training ex tended to the farmer. He does not ex pect congress will enact any of his recommendations at this session, ex cept, perhaps, currency reform and rail road relief. If his present plans are carried out, he will not have any fights on his hands with congress. 

CANNON IS CHOSEN. SET ASIDE JOINT RATE Washington Railroad Commission Is Restrained by Court. Jsdge Hanford Finds Board is En croaching on Power of Interstate) Commerce Law May Remova Objectionable Features of Rresent Joint Rate. G Still Threshing in Gilliam. Condon A great amount of threshing is still to be done in this county. One crew in Ferry canyon has 25 Hays' work ahead. The farmers are hampered great deal by the fact that the threshers will take nothing in payment except gold coin, and this is hard to get. The bad weather of the past week has also hindered them in hauling their produce to market, and a lrage amount of the grain will remain to be hauled in the Bpring. PORTLAND MARKETS. bluestem, 84c; Wood Costs State More. Salem The state boards cpened bids last week for supplying wood to state institutions for next year, the wood to be cut this winter and delivered next summer.

Fir is from 30 to 75 cents a cord higher than last year, and oak $1 a cord higher. The quantity offered is only half the amount required. Bids were not acted upon. Electric Line for Wallowa Enterprise There is some talk that a party of Walla Walla capitalists will organize an electric railway to be run between Walla Walla and points in the Wallowa valley, and unless the O. R. & N. company complies with the condi tions in the right of way deeds, to com plete its line of railway within two years from the date of the right of way deed, there is no doubt an electric line will be constructed in the Wallowa valley.

DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. Seattle, Nov. 30. Federal Judge C. II . Hanford yesterday enjoined the Washington State Railway commission, represented by Harry Falrchild, John C. Lawrence ana Jesse J. Jones, from compelling the railroads to obey the joint rate order on wheat shipped from Eastern Washington points to Puget sound points. The decision is based on Judge Han ford's opinion that it is the obvious in tention of the commission to divert the wheat traffic of that part of the state east and south of Spokane from Port land to Puget sound. The action, the court, holds, is an attempt on the part of the commission to encroach upon the power to regulate interstate com merce vested in congress by the consti tution of the United States. The particular portion of the com mission's order to which the railroads took exception was that prescribing- that the freight charges paid by the shippers in gross was to be divided between the several carriers partici pating in the service. The hands of the commission, however, aie" not abso lutely tied, for Judge Hanford says no- injury will be inflicted by the making: of the supplemental order apportioning: the joint rates. From Judge Hanford s opinion it would appear that the commission is entitled to prescribe a joint rate in the future provided that the objectionable features of the present order are obvi ated. The injunction to be issued," says the court, "will not reetrain the rail way commission from making such an order. This court will not set aside a. joint rate by interlocutory decree or provisional injunction, nor at all, un less upon final hearing it shall be pro red to be insufficient and unreason able." The jurisdiction of the United States District court, which was questioned by the railroads, is maintained by Judge Hanford. 

ASHES COVER THE GROUND. John Sharp Williams Chosen Minority Leader of the House. Washington, Dec. 2. By agreeing to place in nomination for speaker John Sharp Williams, of ..Mississippi, the Democratic members of the house Sat urday in efftct decided to continue him in the position of minority leader for the Sixtieth congress.

Clayton, of Ala bama, presided, and Representative Ryan, of the Buffalo, N. Y., district, was chosen secretary. Immediately after the organization of the caucus had been completed, Rep resentative Thomas, of North Carolina, was recognized, and he proceeded at once to place Mr. Williams in nomina- on. There was no opposition, and Mr. Williams was elected .by acclama tion. Nome and Vicinity Buried in Volcanic Eruptive Matter. Seattle, Nov. 30. A special to the Morning Times from Nome says Nome and probably the entire Seward penin sula is shrouded in an ashy haze and the ground for miles is covered several inches deop with a fine gritty powder which is believed to be volcanic ash. The storm began several days ago,. the dust blowing in from the ocean,, but at first little attention was paid to. the freak of nature, as it was expected that it would soon cease. Instead, however, the fall continued, and after a day became so dense as to seriously interfere with outdoor pursuits. Min ers coming into town reported trial lor miles the snow was so impregnated with the ashes that sledding was al most impossible. Further, the air ia- so full of ashes that breathing is diffi cult and the fine powder has sifted into, houses and business places' to each an extent that it is thick on the floors and on everything in the way of goods and household furniture. It is believed that some of the numerous volcanic is lands, either between this roast and Si beria, or more probably those islands in the Alaska peninsula, or the Aleuti an islands, is again eruption, and that the ashy downpour is the result. No- sericus results are anticipated, but much inconvenience is being caused by the peculiar storm. Barred from California. San Francisco, Dec. 2.
