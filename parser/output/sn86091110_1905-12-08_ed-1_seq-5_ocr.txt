HOUSE RECEIVES NEW RATE SILL Etch-Townsend Measure Is Remodeled and Reintroduced. Special Correspondence. Washington, Dec. 7.— The Esch Townsend railroad rate bill, which passed the house at Its last session, has been redrawn and was reintro duced in the house yesterday by Mr Townsend. The bill embraces all of the features of the former measure, but is drawn so as to specify the things which may be done by the Interstate commerce commission. In addition, it has a publicity fea ture, and gives the commission juris diction over refrigeration and terminal charges. It also directly prohibits the carrier from granting any shipper the privilege of colecting his product, and then getting a special rate under the short term provision for changing rates. As explained today by Mr. Townsend the bill "expresses the ideas fft the president in his message and will, if enacted into law, amend the Interstate commerce law so as to make it more effectual in securing exact jus tice between the carriers, shippers, producers and consumers. Affair in Isle of Pines. The Isle of Pines trouble and the resignation of the Cuban minister, Mr. Squires, directly on account of that trouble, has occupied more attention than the matter really is worth. No body denies that Minister Squires was an energetic and valuable public ser vant, but the fact that hb made him self obnoxious to Cuba was enough to warrant that country in asking for his recall. He had clashed with the Cuban administration over a number of things, the sanitation of the island, which was of course his business, and alleged offensive partisanship in poli tics which was none of his business. Then there came up the Anglo-Cuban treaty which was directly opposed to the interests of America. Mr. Squires fought that perhaps not too wisely but too well and strained relations with the Cuban government almost to the breaking point. When he undertook to side with the Americans who wanted to establish a territorial form of gov ernment under the American flag in the Isle of Pines, he did a thing that perhaps had the sympathy of the ma jority of Americans but which was di rectly opposed to the policy of the state department and Mr. Root called him sharply to terms. Mr. Squires sent in his resignation by cable and it was ac cepted the same way. Korea Will Protest in Vain. The next minister to Cuba, Edwin V.

That country is protesting strongly against the powers breaking off diplomatic relations with her be cause the Japanese protectorate has made the presence of special diplomatic representatives there no longer neces sary. Minister Min of Korea is now on his way to Washington to make an appeal to President Roosevelt, but it is believed that the journey will be fruit less. This country was the leader in the peace negotiations between Japan and Russia and it was properly the first to sever diplomatic relations with Korea when that country was taken over by Japan. This action on the part of Japan while it is quite natural under the circumstances, does not quite square with her declaration that the war was not for purposes of territorial aggrandizement. It is one of those International complications that all the powers were obliged to agree to as a lesser evil than allowing the war to run on. Everybody will be sorry for Korea in a -way, but It is likely that Minister Min had just as well save the travel ing expenses that his journey to Wash ington will entail. Tariff War With Germany. The announcement that Germany had formally denounced the trade agreement under which she lias been operating with the United States for the past five years, is no surprise. This country had known Germany's inten tion for about a year and the senate had let the reciprocity treaties pre sented to go by the board rather than stir itself to tariff revision. The Ger man tariff treaty could have been de nounced at any time on the giving of three months notice by either party. But the present crisis has been brought about by new treaties which Germany has negotiated with Austria Hungary, Switzerland, Belgium, Romania. Italy. Russia and Servia. They will all go into effect on the first of next March and under them the American treaty by which we enjoyed the most favored nation treatment with Germany will cease to exist. The prospect Is that there will be an era of disastrous tariff war between this country and Ger many. We will be hurt severely but It is a question with experts whether we will suffer any more than Germany if as much. However, this coutry had ample warning of what was coming and if congress wants to Inaugurate a period of tariff war, it may the more speedily enforce the lesson that both President McKinley and President Roosevelt tried to inculcate, of fair re ciprocal trade agreements. The lesson may be a costly one, but after all it may be worth the price of admission. Newtowns $7 a Box in England. Hood River, Ore., Dec. 7.—A private letter to A. I.
