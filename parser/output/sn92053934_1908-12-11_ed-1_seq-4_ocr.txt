This is a concession Heretofore the orders have been to do the country. will purchase hundreds of dollars' worth of stamps from persons not con nected with the postal service, and without either asking questions or re porting to the authorities. These stamps are necessarily sold through a "fence" and at a liberal discount, and the government secret service men contend, with some show of reason, that merchants who buy their stamps in large quantities from unknown men are making it easy for the postofflce burglars to go on with their work. The loss in such cases falls on the postmaster, who, while he may be re imbursed by an act .of congress," is al ways compelled to wait a long time for the adjustment of his claim. Recent ly congress has authorized the post master general to settle minor losses, where the facts are satisfactory to the inspectors, but in cases of large loss, like that in the Indiana town, the post master must wait for his relief in spe cial legislation. the -oldest towns in Denmark.- and there lie the bones of departed Danish kings and queens. ..

Tariff revision in the minds of those in authority consists in the creation of minimum and maximum schedules with the pre?ent figures used as the mini mum. The real tariff reformers can get no relief from a revision made by the friends of the protective policy.

The fourth and last of the series of commercial end industrial conferences that have helped to make the present week a notable one in the national capital was held in Washington when the National Council of Commerce met to elect officers, adopt by-laws and to perfect a plan to be followed by the council in its futrrre work. The ses sions were I tld in the offices of the department of commerce and labor and were attended by eminent representa tives of commercial' organizations in virtually every state in the union. The National Council of Commerce, which was inaugurated by Secretary Straus a year ago has aroused consid erable interest throughout the country, about CO commercial bodies from the leading cities of the United States hav ing joined the council since its first meeting. Secretary Straus has be come more and more convinced of the practical value of this progressive or ganization, not only to the commer cial activities throughout the country, which can, through the council, be constantly informed of trade oppor tunities abroad, but to the various de partments oi the government con nected with the business world. One of the features of the movement is the establishment of a permanent bureau of the council in Washington it charge of a capable man who can keep in close touch with the govern ment departments that have to do with commercial affairs and advise the various commercial interests of im lortant matters that arise from time to time and, affect their welfare. Sim ilar bureaus have existed for some time in Germany, England, France and other European countries and have been found to lie of incalculable value In promoting their foreign commerce. 

PRESIDENT'S VALEDICTORY. Answers Question "What Shall We Do For Our Ex-Presidents?" rresident ..Roosevelt iu his office at the White House recently gave what may be considered his valedictory, with permission to a correspondent to use it. The president said: "When the people of the country are asking the question, 'What shall we do for our ex-presidents? tell them that they need do nothing for this ex-president. He is going out to work and to do for himself. "I have had a first class" time as president of the United States, and I have enjoyed every minute of the time I have been In the White House. When I have finished the last stroke I am going out contented and to work."

SPOTLESS TOWN. i KRINGLE JINGLES. Champ Clark says the duty of 3 cents a pound on borax was imposed because a senator from Nevada we preseume this was Stewart would not vote for the tariff bill unless his state got a rake-off. This is characteristic of most tariff making. Borax stood in not the least fear of foreign com petition, buif graft were going around Stewart was determined to get some of it for Nevada. The November Fire Ijoss. The fire loss of the United States and Canada for the month of Novem ber, as compiled from carefully kept records of the New York Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin, shows a total of $15.S34,350. It is less by $3,287,850 than for the correspond ing month last year, and $114,000 less than for November, lflOG. The fire loss in the same territory for the 11 mouths of the year is $224,503,100, which is greater by $24,G33,700 than for the cor responding period last year, and $216 205,450 less than for the 11 months in lftOG. which included the San Fran Cisco loss of $202,501,100. If the loss for April, 1906, the month of that dis aster, had been normal, the compari son would be favorable to the 11 months of that year by about $55,50V 000. During November there were S06 fires which caused a loss of $10,000 or over in each instance. There were nine fires during the month which caused a loss in each instance of $200,000 or over. The Journal of Commerce says that it is well known in insurance cir cles that only the heavy increases in security values has saved a number of fire underwriting institutions from go ing to the wall. Robbing the PotstoffW-r. The stealing of $18,000 worth of stamps and currency from an Indiana postofflce serves to call attention to the report of the postal department showing that this kind of thievery has been growing rapidly for a number of years, in spite of the most determined efforts of the secret service to stamp it out. During the lst year there - were 1,802 such robberies, an increase of 251 over the preceding year. The government assumes losses by robbery of postage stamps amounting to $72, - 984: postal funds, $15,627; a total of about $102,000. In the course of the year 372 post office burglars were arrested and all but a half dozen were convicted. The government never ceases its pursuit of these thieves, who are mostly pro fessionals and make a specialty of robbing postofflces.

The housecieaning tools, hung upon the wall in neat lines, were as numer ous, as diverse and as handsome as the tools of a carpenter or a chauffeur. There were floor brushes, wall brush es, picture brushes all sizes and shapes. There were rakes and scrapers for corners. There were polishing in struments of every kind for glass, for metal, for floors, for furniture. There were sponges, chamois skins, soaps and powders of all descriptions. "It is a complete set of cleaning tools, Isn't it?" said the owner. "It should be complete. I brought it from Ilolland with, me from Broek from Spotless Town.
