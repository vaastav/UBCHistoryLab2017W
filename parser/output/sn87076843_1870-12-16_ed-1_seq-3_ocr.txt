A slight change occurred In tbe running time of some of the trains on the I). & M. road, week before last, to which we neglected to call attention in our last Issue. By reference to the last or present issue, the time table In the Joi n nal will be found correct.

It is a rough comment" npon our Lake Shore climate, that a bouse, like a aniline ves sel, is compelled bv tlio severities of Winter, lo 'send d.. n its top" hamper, and lay by till the curing comes rouuu again. Many of our exchanees are dolne their best to tell beforehand what sort of a Winter we ar to have. Severe weather was due from the mi Idle nf November, and will also bo due till the mid llo of Msrch. Now we have hnd a whole month of mild weather, instead of a month of suvere winter weather, which we had reason to expect; contrqucnlly, upon the scien tific and mathem itical principle nf 'average,' we predict a mild' winter and high-priced ice next Summer. The months of winter yet to come would have to average considerably be low i(ro to produce a severe wioter, and thev will hardly bo to the trouble of doing this.see ing that mild weather bas obtained one full month the start.

The occcasion was one of much interestfaand promises to be produc tive of much good to the cause. The brethren were favored by a visit from Mr. Prase of.Toledo who will deliver an address in this place on the 18th of January, which will be open to the pubi ic. Cntliolic Fair. Our Catholic friends are making extensive preparations to hold a. Fair in Huffman's Hall, Commencing on Monday next, nd to continue during the entire week, the pro ceeds to be applied for the benefit of their church. Fairs of this kind, when properly conducted, are a pleasant source of amassment for youug and old, and are usually fruitful in raising revenue for churches and objects of cbsrity.

FINKBEINER'S. I.iternry Entertainment. Miss E. F. Wki.lman gave our citizens a literary entertain ment, in the shapo of select reading, on Wednes day evening last, in the M. E. CLurch. The notice of the meeting was quite short, yet a considerable audience were in attendance, and regarded with much interest the readings 3t this yuulhftilidy elocutionist. In ju-itico to Miss Welluan, we would stale that in point of gesture, distinct and clear pro nunciation, and beautifully modulated emphasis sha snrpassed our highest expectations, and we have no doubt but she w ill, by the attainment of further experience, attain the highest points of excellency as a lady rhetorician.

Datid I'liii.Lirs, who shed the blood of his neighbor, deliberately and intentionally, also re turned on t'oe samo morning from the State pris on, after a short confinement uf abuut eleven months. Ho may thank bis conns jl fir not roal'zing the truth of that decree: "Whosoever aheddcth man's blond, by man shall his bluo I be shed." It is tu bu hoped that his past experience will beja warning to him in the future. Notice of Perrysburg hy an Illinois r.ditor. We have recently received a visit from John W. Bailsv, Esq., who is well known in this county, )as a former proprietor of the Joi'R. kal. Mr. Bailey removed to Princeton, Illi nois, in 18f3, and, as proprietor of the Buresn County ll'pMicmi, bas mot with great success. As sn old resident of Perrysburg he regarded, with much interest, the advance we have made in commercial, and also in manufacturing enter prise, snd expresses himself in bis widely cir colated paper, the li-ullicaH, in tin) following manner: Arter "doing up" Tofede pretty thnrngklr which city bv the way has grown to a popn'a lion of over 32,000, aiid has completely doubled its railroad and commercial enterprises during the past ten years we.were accompanied to the quiet little town of Perrysburg at the head of navigation on the Muumoe liver, anme ten miles south of Toledo, by N. II. Callard, where we bad ths pleasure of renewing many old ac quaintancea and forming new ones. Since the writer left this section ofcuntry iu 1303, f errya burg has assumed Borne importance aa a manu facturing point, which perhaps is a sufficient offset for losing the county seat. They haru here at present two aaw mills, two planing mills, two or three slave factories, paper mills, flour mills, and a nuinberjof shops-giving employment to a large number i f hands, and making local trade lively. The stave factories alone give iin;doynieut to over a honored workmen, an 1 turn out about two and half million ataves, w ith the necessary headings for barrels, per annum. They slso work a considerable quantity of the materials up iuto barreli for the home Irado. Altogether liio townia)enjoyiiig a bealtbyJataUt of preservation. Pcrrpsburg, it will be remem bered, is the bonis of Dr. E, D, Peck, congress, man elect from the 10th Ohio distrct, and it was our privilege to sre the Doctor and to have an intereating confab over old times, politics snd the new order nf aB'iirs during the past few years. The Doctor enjoys his honors with be coming dignity, snd will make a useful member of congress. We also dropped in at the I'eirys burg journal office, where we found our youug friend,. lames Tiuiiuons, " up to his eyes " in his editorial labors. Of course we made our head quarters at lbs JmiihiI oUjco, during our slay iu P, The New Commissioner. We learn that the newly elected County Commissioner, B W. Kst.LiT, Esq , qualified on the 6th Inst., and entered npon the duties bf his office. It Is well ki own to all of nor fellow citiiens thst the duties of ths Commissioners sre more Arduous than those of any other looal office. Tbeeaa of publio improvements, inch as ditches, roads, snd of buildings, depend. Tory much en their good judgement snd btmlntss capacity, while their cost lo the lax-iayort may bs largely dl mintahed by ths adoption of a just system of contracts fur the execution of such works, It is nndeniabls that ths past action of ths Commissioners 'n these, matters has boen, in many instances, indiscriminate and ill Judged, so that public works whioli, In this eounlr,are In general very costly, hare bicemo oppress ively burdonaome Rod uijust to parties Inter ested. Previons to his nomination wc cordially en dorsed Mr. Ksi.Lir, from the faot that his high character and business capacity well fitted hiiri lo discharge the dutios of Commissioner to the satisfaction nf the tax-payers at large. In as turning the duties of his office we heartily trust that, in association with his colleagues, snob ju dicious measures will be adoptei as may ad vance the credit of Wood county, so that its or ders may be no longer nt the disgracsfully ruin ous dsicnunt which has hitherto governed them. By proper management tho credit of Wood county, and Its prosperity may be made to com pare favorably with the beat counties in the State. Mr. Kkllkt has our best wishes, and will re ceive our hearty concurrence iu evory effort to promote. the public good. Report of Internal Itevcnne. We are under obligatiuns to acting Commissioner Uora LA8 fur R copy of Commissioner Dsi.ano's Re port. The statement made by it Is highly creditable to Mr. Drlamo and his subordinate officers. U exhibits, in the clearest manner, the importance of having honest and competent officers in the pub lic service, which is obtained by the following statement : The gross receipts from sll sources of the in ternal revenue fur the first eighteen months of the present administration, compared with those of the last eighteen mnotlis of llw late adminis tration, are increased to the amount of 019,172,- Gfil 09, and taking the same sources uf revenue, the excess dnriag the same period of compari son in favor of the present administration amounts to the very large sum of $101,8,13 077 1.1. Official acts lik.c thesejspeak to the people in buhalf of the Republican party iu tones of pleas ing eloquence. Let ;tho game line of policy be adopted by the other branches of the public ser vice, and the party in puwer will exhibit a ca pacity for progressive reform which bai hut few parallels, and which will place it' in pleasing contrast with its predecessor in out cial power.
