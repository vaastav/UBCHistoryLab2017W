PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Continued from Page 2. ance corporations created under tlie laws of other states and transacting the larg er part of their business elsewhere is also clear. As a remedy for tlfis evil of conflicting. ineffective, and vet bur densome regulations there has been for many years a widespread demand for federal supervision. The congress has already recognized that interstate in surance may be a proper subject for federal legislation, for in creating the bureau of corporations it authorized it to publish and supply useful information < oncerning the interstate corporations, "including corporations engaged In in surance.'" It is obvious that if the com pilation of statistics be the limit of the lederal power, it is wholly ineffective to regulate this form of commercial inter course between the states,, and as the in surance business has outgrown in mag nitude the possibility of adequate state supervision, the congress should care fully consider whether further legisla tion can be had. What is said above ap plies with equal force to fraternal and benevolent organizations which contract for life insurance. * • ♦ The president recommends the aboli tion of several offices, among them those of receivers of public moneys at United States land offices, which he says will save about a quarter of a million dol lars annually. He also calls attention to the waste in the go>'«i'nment printing department. * • * All contributions by corportions to Tiny political committee or for any po litical purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such pur poses and. moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practice acts. Considerable space is devoted to the subject of peace and the attitude or the I'nited States towards the peace of the world. The president hopes much from the Hague conference. Several reforms in the army are recommended. Applying the Llonroe Doctrine. One of the mos! effective instruments for peace is the Monroe Doctrine as it has been and is being gradually develop ed by this notion and accepted by other nations. No other policy could have been as efficient in promoting peace in the Western hemisphere and in giving to each nation thereon the chance to develop along its own lines. !.• we had refused to apply the doctrine to chang ing conditions it would now be complete ly outworn, would not meet any of the needs of the present day, and indeed would probably by this time have sunk into complete oblivion. It is useful at iiome, and is meeting with recognition abroad because we have adapted our aplication of it to meet the growing and changing needs of the hemisphere. * * That our rights and interests are deep ly concerned insthe maintenance of the doctrine is so clear as hardly to need argument. This is especially true in view of the construction of the Panama canal. As a mere mater of self-defense we must exercNe a close watch over the approaches to this canal; and this means that we must be thoroughly alive to our interests in the Carribean sea. There are certain essential points which must never l>e forgotten as re gards tin* Alonroe Doctrine. In the first place we must as a notion make it evi dent that we do not intend to treat it in any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the ex pense of the republics to the south. We must recognize the fact that in some South American countries there has been much suspicion lest we should interpret the Monroe Doctrine as in some way in imical to their interests, and we must try to convince all the other nations of' this continent once and for all that no just and orderly government has any thing to fear from us. There are cer tain republics to the south of us which have already reached such a point of stability, order, and prosperity that they themselves, though as yet hardly con scious. are among the guarantors of this Doctrine. These republics we now meet not only on a basis of entire equal ity. but in a spirit of frank and respect ful friendship, which we hope is mutual. If all of tlie republics to the south of us will only grow as those to which I allude have already grown, all need for us to the especial champions of the Doctrine will disappear, for no stable and growing American republic wishes to see some great non-American military power acquire terirtory in its neighbor hood. All that this country desires is that the other republics on this conti nent shall be happy and prosperous; and they cannot be happy and prosperous un less they maintain order within their boundaires and behave with a just re gard for their obligations toward out siders. It must be understood that under no circumstances will the United States use t lie Monroe Doctrine as a cloak for territorail aggresison. We de sire peace with all the world, but pet haps most of all with the other peoples of the American continent. There are of course limits to the wrongs which any self-respecting nafton can endure. It is always possible that wrong actions toward this nation, or toward citizens of tiiis nation, in some state unable to keep order among its own people, unable to secure justice from outsiders, and un wililng to do justice to those outsiders who treat it well, may result in our hav ing to take action to protect oyr right*; but stub action will not be taken with a view to territorial aggression, and it will be taken at all onl" with extreme reluctance and when it has become evi dent that every other resource has been exhausted. Moreover, we must make it evident that we do not intend to permit the Mon roe Doctrine to be used by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect it from he consequences of its own mis deeds against foreign nations. If a re public to the south of us commits a tort against a foreign nation, such as an outrage against a citizen of that nation, then the Monroe Doctrine does not force us to interfere to prevent punishment of the tort, save to see that the punishment does not assume the form of territorial occupation in any shape. * ♦ * Chinese Immigration. The conditions in China are such that the entire Chinese eoolie class, that is. the class of Chinese laborers, skilled and unskilled, legitimately come under the head of undesirable imigrants to tills country, because of their numbers, tiie low wages for which they work, and their low standard of living. Not only is it to the Interest of this country t«> keep them out. but the Chinese authori ties do not desire that they should be admitted. At present their entrance is prohibited by laws amply adequate to accomplish this purpose. These laws have been, are being, and will be thor oughly enforced. The violation of them are so few in number as to be infinitesi mal ami can be entirely disregarded. There is no serious proposal to alter the immigration law as regards the Chinese laborer, skilled or unskilled, and there is no excuse for any man feeling or affecting to feel the slightest alarm on the subject. Hut in the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chinese laborers, Chinese coolies, grave injustice and wrong have been done by this nation to the people of China, and therefore ulti mately to this nation itself. Chinese students, business and professional men of all kinds —not only merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro fessors, travelers, and the like —should be encouraged to come here and treated •on precisely the same footing that we treat students, business men, travelers, and the like of other nations. Our laws and treaties should be so framed, not so as to put these people in the excepted j classes, but to state that we will admit all Chinese, except Chinese of the coolie class, Chinese skilled or unskilled labor- | ers. Examinations should be completed at the port of departure from China. For this purpose there should be provided a more adquate consular service in China than we now have. As a people we have talked much of the open door in China, and we expect, anil quite rightly intend to insist upon, justice be ing shown us by the Chinese. We can not ask the Chinese to do to us what we are unwilling to do to them if our labor ing men threatened to come into their country in such numbers as to jeopardize the well-being of the Chinese population; and as these were the conditions with which Chinese immigration actually brought this people face to face, we had and have a perfect right, while the Chinese government in no way contests, to act as we have acted in the matter of restricting coolie immigration. That this right exists for each country was ex plicitly acknowledged in the last treaty between the two countries. But we must treat the Chinese student, traveler, and business man in a spirit of the broadest justice and courtesy if we ex pect similar treatment to be accorded to our own people of similar rank who go to China. Much trouble has come during the past summer from the organ ized boycott against American goods which has been started in China. The main factor in producing tills boycott has been the resentment felt by the students and business people of China, by all the Chinese leaders, against the harshness of our law toward educated Chinamen of the professional and busi ness classes. This government has the friendliest feeling for China and desires China's well-being. We cordially sympathize with the announced purpose to stand for the integrity of China. Such an at titude tends to the peace of the world. Alaska. I earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly confer American citizenship on all citizens of, Porto Rico. I earnestly ask that Alaska be given an elective delegate. Some person should be chosen who can speak with authority of the needs of the territory. The gov ernment should aid in the construction of a railroad from the Gulf of Alaska to the Yukon river, in American terri tory. I should prefer that the delegate i was made elective, but if this is not deemed wise, then make him appointive. The natural resources of Alaska are great. Some of the chief needs of the peculiarly energetic, self-reliant, and typically American white population of Alaska were set forth in my last mes sage. 1 also earnestly ask your atten tion to the needs of the Alaskan In dians. All Indians who are competent should receive the full rights or Ameri can citizenship. it is, for instance, a gross and indefensible wrong to deny to such hard-working, decent-living In dians as the Metlakahtlas the right to obtain licenses as captains, pilots and i engineers, the right to enter mining claims, and to profit by the homestead law. These particular Indians ate civil ized. and are competent and entitled to be put on the same basis with the white' men about them. * ♦ * I The income of the Philippine govern-1 ment has necessarily been reduced by reason of the business and agrieulaural depression in the Islands, and the gov ernment lias been obliged to exercise great economy to cut down its expenses, t«» reduce salaries, and in every way to avoid a deficit, it has adopted an inter nal revenue law, imposing taxes on ci gars, cigarettes, and distilled liquors, and abolishing the old Spanish indus trial taxes. The law has not operated as smoothly as was hoped, and although its principle is undoubtedly correct, it may need amendments for the purpose of reconciling the people to its provis ions. The income derived from it has partly made up for the reduction in customs revenue. A year from next April the first legis lative assembly for tlie islands will be held, on the sanity and self-restraint of this body much will depend so far as the future self-government of the is lands is concerned. The most encouraging feature of the whole situation has been the very great interest taken by the common people in education and the great increase In the number of enrolled students in the public schools. The increase was from 300.000 to half a million pupils. The average attendance is about 70 per cent. The only limit upon the number of pu pils seems to be the capacity of the government' to furnish teachers and school houses. The agricultural conditions of the is lands enforce more strongly than ever the argument in favor of reducing the tariff on the products of the Philippine islands entering the I'nited States. I earnestly recommend that the tariff now imposed by the Dlngle.v bill upon the products of the Philippine islands be entirely removed, except the tariff 011 sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be reduced to -"> per cent of the present rates under the lMngley Act; that after July 1. ! 900. the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced in the Philippine is lands be entirely removed, and that free trade between the Islands and the United States in the products of each country then be provided for by law. Merchant Marine. To the spread of our trade in peace and the defense of our flag in war a great and prosperous merchant marine is indispensable. We should have ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets, and in ease of need to reinforce our bat tle line. It ran not but be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that the lines of communication with our sister republics of South America should be chiefly under foreign control, it is not a wood ibin#? that American merchants and manufacturers should have to send their goods and letters to South America vie Kurope if they wish security and dispatch. Even on the Pad tic where our ships have held their own better than on the Atlantic, our merchant flag is now threatened through the liberal air be stowed by other governments on their own steam lines. * * * Panama Canal. The point which remains unsettled is the question of type, whether the canal shall be one of several .locks above sea level, or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay,be fore the congress at an early "day the findings of t lie Advisory Board of American and European Engineers, that at my invitation have been considering the subject, together with tlie report of the commission thereon: and such com ments thereon or recommendations in reference thereto as may seem necessary. What is needed now and without dlay i sail appropriation by the congress to meet the current and accruing expenses of the commission. The first appropria tion of $14,000,000, <>iit of the $135,000,- (>oo authorized by tlie Spooner act. was made thre eyears ago. It is nearly ex hausted. There is garely enough of it remaining to carry tlie commission to tlie end of the year. Unless the con gress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease. Army Officers Will Learn to Look. Washington, Deo 4.—Under a new policy decided by the war department officers of the commissary department are to be taught to bake bread and will be given praotioal instructions in cook ing. Officers of the commissary depart ment vAll accordingly be sent to the school of application for oavalry and field artillery at Fort Riley, Kan., for a coarse in the school for cooks and bakers. It is ezpeoted that with the aoqnirement of praotioal knowledge by the offioers in the baking of bread and cooking food a great reform will be brought abont in the preparation of food in the army. Powers Reject Sultan's Offer. Paris, Deo. 4.—lt is learned by the Associated Press in the highest govern ment quarter that the powers, after oarefully considering the sultan's lat est oounter proposals, have decided to rejeot them and actively resume the naval demonstration in Turkish wa ter, the next move probably being the seizure of the islands of Lemnos and Imbross. 

ABERDEEN HERALD, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1905 CANNON SPEAKER HOUSE ELECTS HIM TO SUCCEED HIMSELF. John Sharp Williams Democratic Nominee, and Therefore Leader of the House—Little Besides Or ganization Will Be Accomplished the first Week. Washington, Deo. 4.—Republican and Democratic members of the house held their respeoti re oauouses Satur day evening. The Demoorats nomi nated John Sharp Williams, of Mis sissippi, for the offloe of speaker, and he thereby becomes leader of the mi nority on the door of the house, a po sition he has held for several years. The Republicans renominated Joseph G. Cannon, of Illinois, to suoceed him self. All the other offioers of the house were also renominated. Both nominees for speaker made brief speeohes to their followers. Mr. Will iams outlined the legislation for whioh his party should work, and Mr. Can non reviewed the history of his party, touohing at the close upon matters of importance likely to oome up at the pres°nt session.. He also pointed out that, the Republicans having a good majority in both houses, business should prooeed without delay, and that an earlv adjournment of congress should be possible without detriment to pub lic business. Washington, Deo. 4.—Congress con vened at noon and the house at once proceeded with the business of organi zation. Joseph G. Cannon of Mlinois, was re-eleoted speaker, reoeiving the full vote of his party, the Demoorats voting for John Sharp Williams, their canons nominee. Very little besides the organization of the house will be accomplished the first week of the session, although it iB possible that an emergenoy appropria tion for the Panama canal may be passed the latter part of the week. Until the committees are appointed snob a bill would have to be consid ered by unanimous oonsent, or under a special order. It will depend upon the needs of the oanal finances wheth er the emergency appropriation will be rushed through this week or go over until the week following. It is already understood that tire rules of the last bouse will be adopted as soon as the members have been sworn in. The biennial lottery of seats was an interesting feature of the first day, and at its conclusion adjournment was taken. The President's Message. Tuesday will be devoted to the pres ident's message, and that pobably will close the real business of the house for the week. Speaker Cannon has not yet completed his committees, bnt it is expected that he will be ready to an nonnoe them early in the session. Nothing bnt preliminary work will, engross the attention of the senate this first week of the sessioa. The senate is already organized, as it is a contin uous body, and besides there was a special session last spring, when new senators were sworn in. To Honor Late Senator Piatt. Monday was a very short session, the senate adjonrning ont of respeot to the memory of Senator Piatt, of Con- as soon as the neoessary for malities for the beginning of a new congress had been conolnded. Tuesday the president's message will be received and read, and Wednesday is likely to be devoted to the introduction of bills. A short session will be held Thursday, and the senate will then adjourn until the following Monday. It is quite likely that a Republican caucus will be held Tuesday or Wed nesday for the purpose of the appoint ment of a committee to fill committee vacancies in the senate and for the se lection. of a steering oommittee for the sesssion. It is expected that oommit tee vacancies will be filled very early in the session. Cue noticeable feature was the ab sence of flowers, which heretofore have been common to both ohambers. On opening days the display has been so great that the exhibition alone would have been sufficient alone to draw great crowds, and the absenoe of floral trib utes, due to a resolution adopted unan imously by the senate and to an order of the speaker of the house, robbed the occasion of opening of muoh of its pio turesqueness. 

ROBERTS orr TOR SEATTLE. Director of Mint Will Take Charge of Assay Office Inquiry. Washington, Deo. 4.—Director Rob erts, of the United States mint, left Washington yesterday afternoon for Seattle, where he will ttake oharge of the assay offioe investigation. Just before leaving he said he bad reoeived no information of new devel opments in the assay offioe affair, but be is going to Seattle in fulfillment of an intentiion formed immediately after he beard of the arrest of Cashier Adams. New York Printers to Strike. New York, Dec. 4.—ln anticipation uf a general strike of printers Jannary 1, following the rejeotion of the de mand of Typographical Union No. 6 for an eight honr day, the New York Typothetae, the organization of em ploying printers, has sent oat a circu lar to railroad agents throughout New York State offering a commission of 5 per cent for every compositor who oan be induoed to oome to New York and aooept employment. The offer in cludes transportation to New York. ALASKA FAIR IN 1909 COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THAT DATE BE CHANGED. Creditable Showing Could Be Made In 1907, but Later Date Would Insure an Exhibit That Would Command International Atten tion. Seattle, Deo. s.—ln the opinion of the committee on permanent organiza tion, chosen from among the direotors of the Alaska-Yukon exposition, it is inadvisable to hold the fair during the year 1907. The committee is a unit in favor of seleoting 1909. This conclusion was reaohed after a thorough canvass of the situation, and Exeoutive Commissioner Chealander will oall the board of direotors together on Thursday afternoiii for the purpose of reoeiving the report. In recommending a postponement of the exposition for two years, Commis sioner Chealander states that the com mittee did so after becoming convinced that, while a creditable showing oould be made if it be held in 1907, a much more comprehensive exhibit, and one which would insure international at tention, could be oolleoted if the man agement had four years instead of two in which to perfect the details and as semble the material. Three veers was considered by a majority of the com mittee to be ample time in whioh to prepare for the exposition, but in view of the faot that this would necessitate holding it during a presidential year, it was deemed best to recommended 1909. "The postponement," said Commis sioner Chealander, "insures the collec tion of exhibits whioh will command the attention of the whole world. It will also allow abundant time in which to exploit the undertaking to the full est extent, so that when the doors are opened its success will be assured. I have maintained from the beginning that the exposition oould be held in 1907, but it is aparent that there are many reasons whioh appeal f»r a post ponement. One is the fact that James town will hold a tercentenary exposi tion in 1907, under government patron age, in commemoration ot the settle ment of this country. Patriotic socie ties urged that the spirit surroundiing the Jamestown undertaking should give it the right of way. "It should not be inferred that if the direotors see fit to postpone the exposi tion, that there will be any cessation, on the part of Seattle, Alaska and the Yukon oountry in their efforts to pro mote it. Everv div of the time inter vening can be profitably used in the way of preparation. The committee will make a detailed report to the di rectorate at the meeting whioh will be cllead foi Thursday afternoon." OREGON SCHOOL UNO CERTIFICATE FORGERIES Portland, Or., Deo. 4.—Only when all persons holding certificates for sohool land in this state have sent their certificates to Salem to have them ex amined will it be possible to make an estimate of the extent of the gigadtio swindles perpetrated on Easterners by unscrupulous land operators. Gov. Chamberlain stated to the As sociated Press that there is no limit to the number of forged certificates whioh could have been made, and it is safe to say, ho added, that where the cer tificates were hypothecated the fnll amounts shown by the certiofiates were obtained, or where sales were made outright that the full value of the land, as shown by oruising, was paid by the victim. Very few of the persons who possess forged certificates are known so far, but from the faot that persons in Min nesota, Wiaoonsln, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and Florida are in possession of them,- the officials fear that when the whole number develops it will inolude people in every state east of the Mississsippi rviver. The heaviest losers known to the officials so far are H. Goddard, of L>a Crosse, Wis.; George H. Baldwin, of Appleton, Wis., and H. M. Delaittre, of Minneapolis, Minn. Gov. Chamberlain said that at the present time he was nnable to say who the fraudulent operators a^e. The certificates whioh were forged were all for land sold by the state prior to 1900. Only two methods by whioh holders may determine the originality of their certificates without sending them to Salem are offered by the state offioiala. The first is that so far all the forgeries discovered are on paper bearing the watermark "Sterling," a brand of pa per that has never been sold in Oregon, and the other is, the forged certificates are printed from zino etobings made from photographs of the original blank form. Tmns bain Another victory. Helsingfora, Finland, Dec. 4.—The constitutionalists have won another great victory in the appointment of a new senate on constitutional lines. It is headed by Prof. Meobilin, who was banished by the late Gen. Bobri koff and includes representatives of all parties, even of the Socialist. Baron Wrede, one of the vioe presidents of the senate, and three of the new sena tors were, like Prof. Meobilin, banish ed by (ien. Bobrikoff. PROrCSSIONAL
