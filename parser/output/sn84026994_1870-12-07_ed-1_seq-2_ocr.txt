They were intended to commemorate the loss of his four sons-ail kil e l in the present war. . -It is rumored in Berlin in operatic circles that Locei has temporarily retired from the stage on account of the illness of her husband, which ia likely to be prolonged for several months, as he recovers but slowly from the effects of his wound. -Sixteen rosy-cheeked maidens of Be:lin, em? ployed in the chocolate manufactory, recently clubbed'together and purchased one-fourth or a ticket lu the Prussian State.

One of them ls the son of thc chler physician tothe Tycoon, and ls fo study law. The two others have chosen medicine. AU three are said to converse fluently in German, having peen ror some time residents or Berlin for the purpos? of making themselves familiar with the language. ' . -Rewards for special acts or courage are ad? vertised in the German papers. One paper has a hst of these prizes which extends through several columns. The rewards comprise recompense in money, amounting in some cases to many thous? ands cr thalers, besides gold medals, rifles, gold watches, carriages, thousands bottles of wine and innumerable other articles. -The latest dramatic sensation In New York is the introduction of a prizefighter In thc splendid Shakespearean comedy, "As You Like lt." Jem Mace, the pugilist, appears as Charles the wrest? ler, and It ls found that more people go to see him than to witness the play. During thc scene in which he figures, the sensation, we are assured, causes "little shrieks from the ladles," and the triumph or the champion was greeted with "a ripple of gloved applause throughout the house." -The New Yoik Tribune pays its respects to Senator Whittemore in the following words: "We ' hear of the Hon. B. P. Wnlttoniore, who was hustled out of the House of Representatives for selling cadetshlps. He ls elected to - the Stalte Senate of South Carolina, and ls made chairman of the' comm itt ee ou engrossed birts-a place tn which he will be. reasonably free from tempts tlon. Of course, the touching confidence which this man's constituents still entertain In his in? tegrity ia at once- gratifying to him'and to our? selves. His neighbors are at full liberty to be? stow upon him. au the merely local trusts of which.they have the disposal, but the seat lu Con? gress was a national matter, in which every ct ti - zen in the. United States hadan interest. Sb long as Mr. Whlttemore's constituents keep him ' severely at home, we promise not to complain a great deal." -Before tho war in Europe there was a large and continually increasing emigration Into this country from the French and Italian ports In the Mediterranean. This emigration, which embraced generally a thrifty and energetic business class of men, has, since the war, almost ceased. The Arcadian, which arrived at New York last week, from the. Mediterranean, had only twenty-six passengers, though, calculated for two hundred and fifty at least. . The fact shows that this class of persons among'the italians and French prefer to stay at home, as It is not probable that the reasons for -uch a remarkable Tallin? off aro alto? gether, if at all, compulsory. The total foreign , immigration- or this year will rall very much , short or that of last year, and of the general ! average. As this Immigration contributes to national wealth as Woll as to the increase of pop-. 1 ulatlon, an Indefinite but large pecuniary loss In" 1 this respect win be attributable directly to the j European war. -WendeU Phillips did not exhaust his vials or wrath against the Radical party during the late Massachusetts campaign, as appears by the text of an article from bis pen in this week's National Standard, entitled "Protests Against the Republi? can Party." He says the "divisions among Re? publicans In various States are no signs of hostili? ty to the party; they are only protests agaiust Its inactivity. Atalanta lost the race by stopping to t?ck np the golden apples. Hannibal's sol? diers lost Rome by walting to enjoy Capua. And these leaders, many of them, once so earn? est, aw now unmanned and demoralized by a taste of the plunder. While they nearie down to cosy enjoyment or squabble about office, the 1 country suffers.*' Elected on one question, they 1 I shut thetv ^eyea to t?pvefy. other. The bald, h-?lvll rights^Se?t^S. will BO longer serve as I'the vital principle .?f a party; there can be no ' tolerable politic0 which dote not stand as a hand' maid to the religious sentiment of the hour. Of this change the leaders o? the Republican party do not seem to be aware. He describes the fit tempt la Massachusetts to secure recognition of temperance and worklngmen's claims, and holds that the effect has been good and only good. Be prophesies that wi'.hln ten yeare this country is to be t led as never before, except by the slave power, by the associated wealth and selfish ?inion of corporations, which will do Its utmott to un? dermine o sTanglc political liberty, and that the self-contro born of temperance and the organiz? ed ranks of labor arc t o be the bulwarks again* t lt -The report of the comptroller of thc currency, about which so much has been sn ld. is at last printed. It ls brief and unimportant, containing but one new positive recommendation, and that is the placing under legislative restrictions of all the deposits which centre in New York from the country banks, and on which luterest ls paid them, ne says these should be placed under such restrictions as would obviate i he necessity fo.- use by thc depository ban v. Ho adds that he does not think a sweeping enactment would have mach effect, as the city banks would find some way to avoid lt, while private bau;:s would be unrestrained. Regarding the new law of last session for giving the West and Sooth increased banking facilities, the comptroller speaks as fol? lows: "The amonnt of capital to the Western ami Southern Staus not permanently invested or ac? tively employed In business of various kinds, but available Tor the purpose of organizing national banks, cannot be lnrge, and the Impression that many millions of cash capital were awaiting the opportunity of investment in national banks has not been fully sustained. The provision made by the late act Is undoubtedly ample for the supply of those States whtoh have less than their propor? tion, and would suffice to snpply all reasonable demands, even ir not restricted in Its distribution. The propriety of providing for the removal of such restrictions after the expiration ot one year rrom the date or the passage or the act Is recom? mended." The report then adds that there are 1731 national banks in operation, and that thirty one have been organized under the new law, tour or which are gold banks. The President's Message. .Time was, in the better days of thc Re? public; when a President's message had something of the signiOcance and impor? tance of a speech from the Throne in the constitutional monarchies which the para? doxical American both envies and derides. Then, the words of the Chief Magistrate were carefully weighed and deliberately ut? tered, and Congress, looking to the good of the country and not to the salvation of party, lent a respectful attention to the matters of pith aud moment which were submitted to them. Nous avons chang? lout cela ! The Radical revolution in the practice of the gov? ernment; the concentration of power in the hands of a factious Congressional majority; the change from mea like Monroe, Jefferson and'Mums to taciturn mediocrities of the i Grant variety-these account for the little respect which ?3 now paid to the vaticina- ] tions and speculations of the Executive head , of the State. No wonder, then, that Presi? dent G nm t's inaugural prattle about "thc ' "strong box locked up in the sterile moan- j ".tains of i he Far West," of which lie was ' symbollicaliy "forgiag the key," should have i caused a titter at both cods of the Atlantic 1 Cable; or that his message of Monday last, poking fun at the Revenue Reformers, should ; cause no other sensation than broad grins j and feeble applause. The public understand, i however, that Congress will do what it ; may choose, and they care very little for the jest or earnest of his Excellency, Pr?sidant Girant. Yet, in some respects, it is a passing good ; message. The country asks for the- aboli- ? tion of the franking privilege, and a reform ? in the civil service. But the reform should . not be restricted to "the mode of appoint- j "ing subordinate officials." The public ser? vice requires reforming all the way down, bc- , ginuing with President Grant. When we have, once more, a President who, by his dignity and ability and the spotless purity of his official character, is a worthy exponent of the thought and vigor of the country,.then, and not before, will the President's message be accepted as something loftier and better than au expression of the whims and fancies , of a knot of scheming politicians. The most pregurtnt portion of the message i is that which refutes to the Alabama claims j and the fisheries. Taken in connection with . the speeches of Geueral Butler in the East and of General Hooker in the West, and j with tho significant circumstance that the . war speech of General Butler has been sent, in pamphlet form, to all the foreign minis? ters under the frank of the State Department, j the recommendations of President Grant in? dicate, with sufficient clearness, a desire to conviuce the people that they have a sub- ' etantiul grievance for which they must ex? act a full reparation. The proposition thal j he be adowed to suspend certain laws, at his own sweet will and pleasure, is what might , be expected from a President who has wit- j ncssed the course'of Radical reconstruction in the South, and has nobly done his part in i violating the law and the constitution. We 1 doubt, however, that Congress will be wil? ling to entrust so much power to a vaiu, ' weak man, and we know that, whatever the temper of the Radical politicians, the masses i of the people oppose war and love peace. The Radicals cannot more surely nail down thc lid of their political coffin than by squiut- . ing at a foreigu war. ?? The President seeui3 to be ignorant of i what tho people desire. They do approve of the abolition of all restrictions upon the ownership of foreign-built vessels. They do ? desire revenue reform But they go farther I than this. They a3k that the expenses of the government be reduced; that the tariff be j arrangeu fer revenue alone, and that this I generation bc not culled upon to pay a war ? debt which \va3 contracted-according to 1 the Northern idea-for the benefit of poster- \ ity, and which was heaped up-according to ! the Southern idea-during the process of . overrunning and subjugating the fairest States of the South. Honesty, Economy, ' Low Taxation-these are what the people f Jemand, and. what they do not hope to ob- j Lain from any administration of which Pre3- ? ident Grant is the leader and responsible \ head. The State Lunatic Asylum. We print an article from tho Columbia Phoenix, to whicli a brief reference has al- ? ready been made, containing a statement of : facts in connection with the terrible abu3es said to exist in the management of the State j Lunatio Asylum-an institution in which \ the people have taken a deep interest, and whose philanthropic purposes commend it c to the care and regard ot the public. It is 8 not doubted that Dr. Ensor is doing the beat.: he can with the material' at his command; brit the brutal tyranny of the neg^Tlarrte; as described-bv*'the Phoenix, is' an outrage upon decency abd propriety.-' Governor Scott seems inclineoTto support such measures as will increase the efficiency of the institution and insure tho comfort and well-being of its inmates, and we trust that the General Assembly will require that the existing condition of affairs be thorough? ly investigated, with the object of protecting the unfortunates who cannot care for them? selves, and are, ns it were, the warde of the State. If the coloredjunatics prefer to have a colored keeper, we have no right to object, bot we must protest against the practice of submitting jvbite men and white women to the capricious insolence and constant ill treatment of a cruel and malignant negro. Harris is, we believe, the secretary and treasurer of the Asylum, a3 well a3 the head attendant, and to keep him in a posilion for which be is, by nature and temper, wholly unfit, i3 only to prove that it is determined to make use of the helpless and the afflicted as a means of rewarding the hangers-on of a political part}-. The man Harris was ap? pointed, we presume, because he is a negro Radical, and for that reason alone can he be retained. _ r _ The Cherubic Kimpton. A resolution has beeu offered by Sena? tor Arnim requiring the Financial Agent of | the State to make a full report of the mone? tary transactions of which he bas bad charge. This was necessary to be done. Governor Scott says not a word of Mr. Kimpton in bis annual message; nor does tbe Treasurer or the Comptroller-General; as far as we know, describe the involutions and evolu? tions of the millions which have been com? mitted to the Financial Agent's caro. The circumstance that Mr. Kimpton i3 out of ] favor at this time is, if true, no reason why his accounts should not be exposed to the public. Wo want to know what has become of the .S2,700,000 in bonds of the State which Kimpton held one year ago, according to the report of the Comptroller-General. And we should like to- be told, without circumlocu? tion, what were the terms upon which Henry Clews & Co., of New York, were willing to take the $4,000,000 of Blue Ridge Railroad guaranteed bonds, and whether the Franco German war is the only reason why the ne? gotiation fell through. Wo hope that Sena? tor Arnim will push his resolution. M (if? nc at io nal. OU NT
