INAUGURATION OF GOV. HAMPTON. The oath of office was administered to Governor Hampton and Lieutenant-Governor Simpson, at 3 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon of last week, in the presence of the presiding officer and of the joint committee of the two houses of the General Assembly. Lieutenant-Governor Simpson, Chief Justice Willard, the President and clerk of the Senate, Speaker and clerk of the House, private secretary Wade Manning and the members of the joint committees severally appointed to witness the ceremony and convey the sympathy of the General Assembly to the distinguished sufferer, left the State-House at 2 o'clock and proceeded in carriages to the Governor's residence in the suburbs, where they were received by Major Wade Hampton, Jr., and conducted to the bedside of the Governor, who extended a kindly welcome to all, and shook hands with each gentleman of the party. The oath of office was then administered, by Chief Justice Willard, to the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor in turn. After taking the oath, the Governor requested the committees to report to the General Assembly that he had received them, aud in accordance with their notice had duly qualified by taking the requisite oath. Col. C. R. Miles, in behalf of the committees of the two houses, expressed, in brief and appropriate terms, the heartfelt sympathy for the Governor of the representatives of the people of his State. In response, the Governor desired Col. Miles to read to the members present an acknowledgment which he had ? - * - .1 - -i / r i. L dictated to mat gentleman a iew minutes uefore, and which was as follows: Gentlemen of the Committees : I beg you to represent to the General Assembly my deep sense of the kindness and honor they have done me in sendjng these committees of condolence, and to assure them that I appreciate this action on their part most gratefully. I beg that you will also say, that a large part of the regret I*experience at the accident which has confined me, arises from the fact that it comes at a time when it* deprives me of the opportunity of taking counsel with the General Assembly on the great issues impending, and in endeavoring to assume my share of the responsibility. I thank you, gentlemen, for the kind and feeling manner in which you have discharged the duty with which you were entrusted. Immediately after the inauguration ceremonies were concluded, Governor Hampton issued his proclamation devolving the duties of Governor upon Lieut. Governor Simpson. JUDGE T. B. FRASER. Hon. T. B. Fraser, elected to the circuit bench last week, by both houses of the Legislature, as successor to the late Judge Shaw, is a gentleman of fine legal attainments, courteous in his bearing, and having always been a close applicant to the duties of his profession, thoroughly understands the law, which it is now made his duty to expound. He is a native of Sumter county, and was born on the 27th of October, 1825. He graduated at the South Carolina College in the class of 1845, and was admitted to the practice of the law in 1847. About this time he married as his first wife, Miss Mary Margaret Mclver, of Yorkville. His first entrance upon public life, was as a member of the Legislature in 1858, and he was re-elected for three successive terms, serving in that body until the Southern Confederacy was dissolved in 1865. In the fall of that year the new Legislature elected Mr. Fraser to the position of District Judge for Sumter, but, in consequence of delays caused by the interference of the military authorities, he resigned without taking the oath of office. In 1861 he was appointed Democratic County Chairman for Sumter, and has filled that position to the present time. Duping the memorable campaign of 1876, he was a member of the State Executive Committee. In December, 1877, he was elected to the Senate to fill an unexpired terra, and was reelected in November last. PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.

Jute resembles hemp in appearance, and is used in manufacturing cotton bagging ? The Abbeville Press and Banner says: "The colored Methodist minister at this place is about the best paid preacher in the county. He ministers to a membership of about three hundred communicants.

They pay five hundred dollars in money and seven dollars a week, in addition, for rations for his family. This seven dollars is raised by weekly collections after religious services. The beauty about this matter is that the congregation is never behind in payment. Think of it. A colored congregation pays $500 sal try and 8364 rations, making 8864 and a nice little parsonage.

Qtofa hnonj r?( onii a Iivaf inn The same I/J1C UiaiC UUUI W V/? VljViMt.liHV.VM, committee reported unfavorably upon Mr. Callison's joint resolution to repeal a joint resolution for the eettlemeut of the bonded debt of the State. The committee were unanimous in arriving at this conclusion. The bill was placed on the calendar. The judiciary committee reported favora-j" bly on the following: A bill to make jury . and witness tickets in State courts receivable j for county taxes; bill to amend an act to re-1? duce and fix the salaries of certain officers;1 i bill to provide for a revision, digest and rear- , rangement of the Statute laws of the State. | j Upon the resolution that the judiciary com- j i mittee be instructed to report upon the power ! of the Legislature to valididate sales for par- j tition made by judges of probate, the same f committee reported that this matter was not | a subject to be corrected by legislation. ' The bill for the relief of the counties of, Spartanburg, Greenville, Union, Pickens, I: York, Chester. Lancaster and Chesterfield,; j which have subscribed bonds in aid of certain | railroads, came up as a special order. This ; ] bill allows the taxes due and payable to the 1 State by the railroads built by the couuties,! j to be used as a sinking fund by the county' < commissioners to retire the bonds issued in aid of the railroads. Mr. Buist moved to strike out the enacting clause of the bill. A debate followed, in which Messrs. Cleveland, J. J. Hemphill, Shand, Murray and Seegers supported the bill, and Messrs.

A bill requiring a special license tax on dogs was killed. The judiciary committee made an unfavorable report on a bill to utilize the labor of prisoners in county jails, under sentence. Thursday, December 5. In the Senate, Gen. Gary's bill to repeal a joint resolution providing a mode for ascertaining the debt of the State, came up as the special order. Gen. Gary obtained the floor and harangued the Senate at some length, a synopsis of which is reported in the Nevoa and Courier, as follows : ' He reviewed the debt question from its first appearance in politics up to the present time. "In the campaign of 1876, Gen. Gary said, "this bond question was not before the people. It was dragged before them during the last month of the campaign. The committee of seven took upon themselves the authority to say to the people of Smith flarnlin.i that. thov should nav all the debts of the State, without stopping to examine which were valid and which were fraudulent. The next appearance of the bond question is when Gov. Hampton, in his first annual message, recommends that a commission should be appointed to thoroughly investigate the indebtedness of the State. When this recommendation of the Governor reached the Senate and took the form of a joint resolution looking to the appointment of such a committee, I moved to strike out that part which said that three outsiders should be upon the committee. I knew that if these persons were put upon the committee, it woulu be converted into a whitewashing committee." Gen. Gary next turned his attention to Governor Hampton, and repeated much that he said on a former occasion. He said he thought it false modesty not to allude to Governor Hampton's record. The News and Courier was next handled very roughly by the speaker, because it bad advocated the payment of the legal debts of the State. The most violent portion of General Gary's effort, however, was when he came to deal with the Judiciary. Chief Justice Willard came in for a large share of his abuse, He thanked God that he had not voted for Willard ;-that he had never voted for a converted Kadical, (looking daggers at Judge Mackev, who was an earnest listener in the lobby;) tbat'he never would cast his vote for one. The charges that Judge Willard had been bribed by Morton & Bliss to renders decision in their favor, were rehearsed and enlarged upon. In 18(51 South Carolina seceded from the United States. Our theory was that we had a right to secede ; those who opposed secession was that we had no right to secede, but that once in the Union always in the Union. The General Government passed an act to reconstruct the Southern States. The theory was that the sovereignty of South Carolina had been destroyed by war. If the sovereignty of South Carolina had been destroyed by war, its debts were blotted out. Every lawyer who understands the law on corporations knows this. A convention of the people of this State met and formed anew constitution, and South Carolina was again admitted. If the sovereignty of South Carolina wasdestroyed, and every one admits this, then the State does not owe a dollar of her ante bell urn debts. South Carolina was an independent State, a part of the Confederate States, and was connuered as a part of the Confederacy. Now, if the Confederate debts were wiped out by the war, were not the ueuis 01 oouiu uarnnua aino wipea ouu n is expecting too much of the people of South Carolina, after suffering all the horrors of war, after being robbed and dragged into the dust, for them now to come forward and pay the fraudulent debts. I have been driven to the position which I now take. Why ? Because I have been persecuted by the bloated bondholders ever since I have been in this House. The tight on this bond question lias been an unequal one. It is a wellknown fact that none of the able arguments which are opposed to paying the fraudulent debts are over published in the newspapers. The papers run 111 the interest of the bloated bondholders studiously avoid publishing any of these speeches. Now, let us go back to the bonds issued before the war. What werothese bonds issued for? Were they issued to make great public improvements, or to build great railroads? No! If the Legislature is to be bought up, if the Judiciary is to be bought up, then it were better that Chamberlain had never left. South Carolina. But I am glad he has gone, and I don't want him to come back. If he does come back, it will be to be tried upon sornecliaige of which he is innocent. Why don't they bring him here and try him upon some charge which will convict him? The hands of the attorney-general are tied so that he can do nothing. Gen. Gary then paid his respects to various State officials, and opened the vials of his wrath upon all persons, Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, State officers, senators, members of the House, judges, newspapers, preachers, and everybody else who favored the payment of the debt of the State. His speech, especially those parts which referred to Governor Hampton, and also his violent denunciations of the Chief Justice, created a decided sensation. Mr. Crittenden, of Greenville, obtained the floor and spoke earnestly in favor of the bill. At the conclusion of bis remarks, a motion was made and carried, that the further consideration of the bill be made the special order for to morrow at 1 o'clock. In the House, Mr. McGowan introduced a bill to provide for the establishment of a State mineralogical bureau and mineralogical survey of the State. Mr. Blue introduced a bill requiring 25 per cent, of all moneys received for liquor licenses throughout the State to be paid into the State treasury. Mr. Anderson introduced a bill to fix the pay of members of the General Assembly. This bill fixes the pay of members at $5 a day for thirty-five days. Mr. Humbert introduced a bill to amend an act to alter aud amend tbe law in relation to elections. The effect of the proposed amendment is to completely separate tbe State and County elections from the Congressional and Presidential elections. It provides two boxes, one for the reception of ballots for State and county officers, and the other for the reception of ballots for Presidential Electors and Congressmen. It also provides that there shall be two separate boards of State canvassers, the one to pass upon the State and county elections, and the other to pass upon the National elections. No candidate for any office will be eligible to membership on either of the said boards of canvassers. The judiciary committee, on a bill to prevent and punish the intermarriage of tbe races, reported a substitute, entitled a bill to prevent and puuish the intermarrying of the races. The comraitttee on railroads reported favorably on a bill to charter the Spartanburg and Augusta Railroad Company. The committee on offices and officers reported favorably on a bill to provide for the payment of the past indebtedness of the school districts in the counties of tbe State. The bill in relation to appeals from trial justices'courts was indefinitely postponed. The House refused to reconsider the vote by which the enacting words of a bill for the relief of the counties of Spartauburg, Greenville, Union, Pickens, York. Chester, Lancaster and Chesterfield, which have subscribed bonds in aid of certain railroads, were stricken out. Friday, December 6. In the Senate, the committee on railroads, reported favorably on a bill to prevent extortion by railroad companies in this State; and unfavorably on a bill to create a railroad commission; but recommended a bill differing from the other, and which provided for the appointment of but one commissioner instead of three. The bill to prevent mad dogs going at large was rejected. The special order for 1 o'clock, Mr. Gary's bill to repeal a joint resolution entitled "A joint resolution providing a mode of ascertaining the debt of the State and liquidating and settling the same," was demanded. A motion was made that the further consideration of the special order be deferred until next Monday. This motion was productive of a short and sharp debate, participated iu by Messrs. Taft, Lipscombe, Wiley, Gary, and others, but was finally lost by a vote of 19 to 10. The Reporter of the News and Courier says: Mr. Taft, in order that the merits of the question might be reached, moved that the enacting clause of the bill be stricken out. Mr. Mcetze obtained the floor and spoke at }ome length. He began by replying to the arguments as to the constitutionality of the Bond r. l ---i-:..I. t?> i ?i .1.. ?i n?... i L/Ouri W 1111*11 IlitU UtJtJU ttUHUWI ijy ajruu* \jraijr. I Mr. Meetzo confessed that the' position which tie bore to the Bond Court, necessarily prevented tiim from speaking as freely as he should like. 3en. Gary here asked Mr. Meetze if, as a lawyer, : ae regarded the Bond Court constitutional? "I, jo not think I am called upon to reply to such ' I questions as those propounded by the senator of ! Edgefield," remarked the speaker, and he proceeded with his remarks. He was interrupted ! by Mr. Taft, who asked some pointed questions, 1 which he likewise declined to answer. Mr. I Meetze did not go into the merits of the debt i question, but confined himself to the bill now ! before the .Senate. Though in favor of the bill, ! Mr. Meetze failed to give any reasons why it ought to pass. When Mr. Meetze finished his address, Mr. Taft made an earnest as well as able argument against the passage of the bill. Among other things he said : There are few Republicans in the General Assembly now, but I now take the same position on this question that I have always taken. When this compromise was first proposed, I then opposed it. The Democratic caucus, from which I was of courso excluded, made the compromise, and the Republicans had uoth ing to do with it. Mr. Taft said he was opposed to again opening the debt question. That If the bill were passed it would virtually bring back the question as it was presented to the Legislature, that it would be no nearer settlement than when Lhemiestion was discussed here at the last . session, "ifrje idea of the gentleman of Edgefield is to reopen this question, and tear open the wound, which is now healing so well. Now, I am opposed to this. The advocates of this bill propose to abolish the Court just before its decision is rendered. Now, my idea is that this whole question will finally reach the Supreme Court. It seems to me that the advocates of this measure are acting like school-boys, and it is not necessarj' for me to enter into a full discussion of the question which has already been so fully discussed at the last session of the Legislature. When Mr. Taft took his seat, Gen. Gary again opened his batteries against those who opposed his bill. Ho reiterated many of the charges of fraud, <Sc., that were contained in his speech yesterday. He said that. Governor Hampton's threat had silenced opposition and had an undne weight with those who were to vote upon the question. Since the Kadical Convent'on has repudiated Governor Hampton and declared that his government is a failure, upheld by the rifle clubs, the . influence of Radicals is gone. I giye notice now, I that as long as I live in this State (and I do not { expect to leave) I will raise my voice against . paying one dollar of these fraudulent bonds. He deriied that South Carolina could be sued, and said that those who told the ignorant people that I she could be sued and made to pay these dishonest debts, were deceiving them. That those who made such statements were demagogues who resorted to this subterfuge to carry their vile ends. di The speaker alluded personally to Col. C. H. Simontonas the draftsman of the resolution and as the paid attorney of the bloated bondholders at the same time. Col. 8Imonton authorizes me to state that he had no connection as attorney or otherwise with any bondholders urtil after the adjournment of the last session of thfi General Assembly. At. the conclusion of General Gary's speech, the question of striking out the enacting clause of the bill was called for. The ayes and nays were demanded, and the vote taken, which resulted, ayes 18; nays 14. . Those who voted in the affirmative are: Messrs. Bird, Bradley, Buck, Cannon, Coker, Collins, Counts, Cravton, Fraser, Jeter, Kinsler, Maxwell, McCall, McQueen, Moore, Siegling, Taft and Walker. Those who voted in the negative are: Messrs. Butler, Crittenden, Duncan, Fisbburne, Gary, Howard, Lipscombe, Livingstone, Meetze, Patterson, Toda, Williams, Witnerspoon and Wiley. The following senators were absent: Messrs.
