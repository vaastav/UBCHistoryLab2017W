Events at Shanghai show that China is cracking under the strain of trying to be a republic. TALK OF THE TOWN Some duy South America will believe the United States means what it says about being friendly. Von Bernstorff has acquired the Yankee habit of asking questions, but he is not liiscriminating' about the time to ask them. ' This is the time when the mail carrier begins to feel like a pack horse. . You can lighten his burden later on by send ing your holiduy presents now. After a short service as business man ager of The Advance, Wellington Smith announces that he has severed all rela tionship with that journal and intimates he is to start a new "state-wide", weekly newspaper. Which may or may not be tantamount to a declaration of war. If the spirit of patriotism flames as strong in the breasts of all French people as bursts forth from some of the leaders of thought in that country, the war will end only when France has regained her lost laurels of 1870 and placed Belgium back where it was before the war. The utterances of those leaders, as permitted to reach the outside world, are extremely patriotic and are, moreover, filled with a new note of confidence as to the out come of the war. The Panama-Pacific exposition was a success and without Vermont partici pating officially. Moreover, Vermont did not lose any prestige by not being repre sented by a $25,000 or $.'10,000 building, to be sold for $087 at the close. The next time a slick, ingratiating advance ngent of some proposed exposed comes before the Vermont legislature and pleads for the squandering of $j.i,000 or $50,iHi() for a Vermont building at his exposi tion we Vermonters would do well to re call our experience with relation to the San Francisco show. We would do well to remind ourselves that we did not de tract from the success of that exponi- tion by not having a state building and that we as a state did not lose any pres tige because of of lack of such represen tation. We should bear in mind, too, that a like amount of money spent in well-selected publicity for the state would do far more for the advance of the Hate.
