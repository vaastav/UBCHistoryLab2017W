The substance of the Presldeut'i message was pretty acutely foreseen but its effect was decidedly miscalcu? lated. The suggestion that loyal pow? er should ho given lo penult "under specified conditions and careful super? vision, rate agreements clearly in the Internst of the public" was fastened upen as pointing in eileet to authoriza? tion of the revival of railroad pooling. The effect was most pronounced in the members of the Vanderbllt group, und this caused conjectures of a revival of the (dan u>r a merger In that group.

The first conference of nations bold nt Tho Hague ia I800. being unable to dispose of all the business before It. recommended the consideration and (settlement of n number of Important questions by nuotber conference lo bo culled subsequently and at an early date. These questions were the follow? ing: .ii The rights and duties of neu? trals; (2) tie' limitation of the armed forces on laud and *?-a and of military hudgi is; (3) the use .if new types and calibers of military and naval guns: ?.be Inviolability of private property nt sett In linns of war; (5J the bombard n ent of pons. cities and villages by na? val force-- in October, 1001, at the in? stance of the interparliamentary union, l issued Invitations to all the powers ilgnatory to The Hague convention to ?en t delegates to such a conference and suggested that It be again held nt The Hague. Prom all the powers acceptance was received, coupled in some eases with the condition tlint we should wall until he end of Ihe war then waging be tweeu iJnssia and Japan. Tho emperor of Itnsshi, immediately after the treaty >f peace which sr. happily terminated this war, in n note presented to the ii . ??! lent .>n Sept. t:; took Ute Initiative in recommending that the conference i be now called. Tho United States gov l eminent in response expressed Its cor? dial acquiescence nnd staled that It I wi ?Iii a.-i a matter of course take part j In the new conference and endeavor to [ further its alms. Wo assume that all I etvi?r.ed governments will support the movement and that tho conference is , uovt ah assured i"act. This government j will do everything in Its power to se cur? the success of the conference to the end that substantial progress may be made nt the cause of international p. ace. Justice ?ml good will. Monroe Doefrtne, There nre certain essential points which must never I?- forgotten as re ??: rds the Monroe doctrine. In the first p .. ?-. we must as a nation make it ev? ident that we do not Intend lo treat it j m my chape or way as au excuse for . if- ;rnndizement on our part at the ex I p.-i, of tie- republics to the south. Hut we must make it evident that we do not intend lu permit the Monroe doc iriue to bo used by any nati.ui on this continent as a shield to protect It from the consequences of Its own misdeeds tgainst foreign natlous. The Monroe ! ? rlne does not force ns to interfere to prevent tho punishmcut of n port i tave tu see that the punishment does '; not assume the form of territorial occu ', pittlon in any shape. Tbe case i: more . diUicnlt when :t refers to a contractual obligation. This country would cor { ti inly decline to go to war to prevent a , foreign government from collecting a I jv i debt. On Uie other hand. it. Is very Inadvisable to permit any foreign power to take possession, even tempo? rarily, of the custom houses of an Au erlcuu republic in order to euforce ihe payment of Its obligations, for sucb temporary occupation might turn into a permauo;.! occupation. The only es euye from these alternatives may ct any time be thai we must ourselves undertake to bring about sonic arrange? ment by which so much ns possible of a .bist obligation shall be paid. To do so Insures the defaulting re? public from having to pay debts of au j Improper character under duress, while j it also insures holiest creditors of the J .?public from being passed by in Uie iulerest of disboucst or grasping ercd ( iiors. Moreover, for the United Stales to take such a Position offers the only (Kisslble way of insuring us against a I '"lash with some foreign power. The ;i sition is therefore in the interest of peace as well as lu the interest of jus Santo Domingo. ! Sun to Domingo has now made an up I ji to us. and not only every principle I of wisdom, but every generous iusUnct j within uu. bids us respond to the op peal. The condiUons In Santo Domingo I have for a number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all lOeletj was on the verge of dissolution. Fortunately just at this lime a ruler : prang up In Santo Domingo who. with I his colleagues, saw the dangers threat ?ping their country nnd appealed to the I friendship of Uie only neighbor who I possessed the power and the will to help them. There was Imminent dam I "er of foreign Intervention The pa j lence of foreign creditors had become ixbausted, und at least two foreign na? tions were on Ihe point of intervention 'and were only prevented by the unoffi? cial assurance of this government that i it Woukl Itself strive to help Santo I Domingo In her hour of need. Accordingly, tho exceuUvo depart ment of our government negotiated a treaty under which wo nre trying to help tin- Dominican people lo straight .?ii but their finances. This treaty Is pending before the senate, lu the meantime n temporar}' arrangement has been made under which the Domin? ican government hns appointed Ainer j ieans to nil die Important positions in '?be customs service, and they are see I ng to the holiest collection of the rev ? iUUCS, turning over 45 per cent to the government for running expenses and putting tho other g? per cent Into n safe depositary for equitable division I'n case the treaty shall be ratified . among the various creditors, whether : European or American, j Under the course taken stability and order nnd oli the benefits of pence tiro at la&t coining to Santo Domingo, dan? ger of foreign Intervention bar. been ?suspended, and there Is nt lust n pros? pect toot all creditors will get Justice rn n^i-t- infl bo looj, ff tl^e arrar.aj Imit Is terminated by tbe failure of lie treaty chaos will follow, ntul sooner ? >r later this government tuny lie in rolvetl In serious difficulties with for? eign governments over the Island or j pise may bo forced Itself to intervene In the island in soute unpleasant fash- j Ion. Amir nnit Nnty. 1 lie not believe that any army lu tin tvorid lias n better average of enlisted ! ,unn or n better typo of Junior officer, | but the army should be trained to act I rffectlvely in a uinss. Provision should I.ade by sulllclent appropriations ! for inniicuvcrs of n practical kind. Provision should be made for the pro motion of exceptionally meritorious i .? :i over the heads of their comrades md for the retirement of all men who have reaehetl a given s-_-o without j;et tins; boyontl a given rank. There should be an Increase In the ?oast artillery force so that our const rortilientious can lie In some degree tdcquntoly manned; There Is special need for nn Increase and reorganization if Hi- medical department of the army. !n both the army and envy there must ho the same thorough training for duty n the Maff corps as in the flgbtitig Hue. The Importance of tills was shown eon-1 ciuslvely In the Spanish-American and :hi' flusso-.lnpttiicse wars. The work if tin- medical departments In the jsp iinpse army and uavj Ii espeelally ; I worthy of study. um- navy must, relatively to the nn- i vies of other nations, always be of iireater si/..- than our army. We have most wisely continued for a number of years to build up our navy, and it '.eis now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency, 'this standard must not ? ?id ? be maintained, hut Increased. It do ? not seem to me necessary, how? ever, that the navy should, at least In tlie immediate future, he increased be? yond the present number of units. What is now clearly necessary i* to substitute efficient for Inefficient units as tlie latter become worn out or as It be.-- me'-! apparent that they arc use? less, 1'robnlily Ihe remit would be at tu hied i,y adding a single battleship to our navy each year* the superseded or outworn vessels being laid up or broken up as they are thus replaced. Xntaraliiatlou. On this subject I recommend; First.?A federal bureau of naturali? zation, t-> 1"- established in the depart? ment ol commerce and labor, to su? pervise ihe administration of the natu? ralization i-iws and to receive returns of naturalizations pending and accom? plished. Si coiid. -Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to be charged, and procedure. Third. More oxnetli.K qualifications for citizenship. Fourth, The preliminary deeiuratlnn of Intention to bo abolished and no alien to bo naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing of his peti? tion. Fifth. ? Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to be confined to United States district courts and to such state courts as have jurisdiction In civil notions In which He- amount in controversy Is un? limited; in cities of over 100.000 inhab? itants the United States district courts to have exclusive Jurisdiction In the { naturalization of the alien residents of such cities. Criminal Law?. In my last message 1 asked the nt tent ion of the congress to the urgent need of action to make our criminal law more effective, and 1 most ear? nestly request that .ton pay heed to the report of tlie attorney general on this subject. There seems to he no statute of tbe United States which provide? for the punishment of u United states attor j ney or other officer of the government I who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain from doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement is other than ono possessing money value. This outfht to be remedied by appropriate legislation, Legislation should also be enacted to j cover explicitly, unequivocally and be? yond question breach of trust in the I shape of prematurely divulging official secrets by an officer or employee of the ! United States and to provide a suitable penalty therefor. Merchant Marine. To tb?. spread of our trade iu peace nud tbe defense of our Dag In war n great and prosperous merchant marine Is Indispensable. Wo should have ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets .nul in ease of need to re-enforce our battle line. Ii cannot bill be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that the lines of communication with our i ?? republics of ?outh Ann rlcn should bo chiefly under foreign control, li la n a good thing that American merchautJ and manufai turers should have to send their k.hmIs :,i>.i letters to South Amer? ica via Europe if they wish security ami dispatch. Even on the Pacific, where our ships have held their own better than on the Atlantic, our mer? chant flag is now threatened through the liberal as! I? -'owed by other k>,v erhments on their own steam lines. 1 I ask your earnest consideration of the : report with which the merchant ma i r!r,e commission has followed its Ions ! and careful inquirj. It Is a inaiter of unmixed satisfac I tion oiico more to call attention to the i excellent work of ihe pension bureau, for the veterans of the elvi! war have a greater claim upon us than any other ciass of our citizens. To them first of .nil nmong our people honor Is due. Iminlffrntion. As l said in my lasl message to the congress, we cannot have too much immigration of the right sort, ami wo should have none whatever of the wrong ?ort.
