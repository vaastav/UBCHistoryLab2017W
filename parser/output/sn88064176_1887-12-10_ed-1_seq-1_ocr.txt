President Cleveland's message to Congress last Monday is a docu ment of unmistakable force, and will exert a powerful influence upon the legislation of that body. His views upon the tariff question are decided, and expressed with the firmness of conviction. His policy is to reduce the tariff upon articles of utility and necessity, while the revenue duties levied on tobacco and whisky should be raised. He proves to the farmer n that a high tariff can have no in- 1 fluence to raise the price of the products he has to sell, while it saddles upon him an unnecessarily high price for his agricultural im plements and all the articles of domestic use. It is about four columns in length in the city pa pers, too long for us to publish it entire, but we will endeavor to give ourreaders a synopsis of it next week* A week or two since Mr. South arlin in a speech st Shreveport < tried to controvert Mr. Blanchard's I argment sgainst a third term, by t stating that 36 governors have held a three sucosesive terms. Mr. B. knocks his flimsy subterfuge all to c 8inders by showing that out of i 1140 governors, from 1776 to the I present time, only 12 have held t office for a longer period than a aeIr years, and the written and f unwritten law of the land is against long tefarms of chief executive I power. The people of Louisian t do not propose to violate all pree- a dent by etending MeEnery's lease i of power to eleven years. E Tens, which has less than 50 - t white voters, sad st best should a only be entitled to ire delegates to the State convention, has ele her 19 traadulent delegats to XcEnery. 8elh - Nicholls Holds the Lead.

The grand jury report that they had 44 emsm presented before them. of which they examined 41, finding 16 tre bill., leaving 28 ases in which no bills were found. The grand jury was in seemion about 8 days aend summomed before their Sbody several hundred witneases, and yet they toll s, in theire tohat crime is deoreasing in the Pari. w are we to judge of the ollot of erime? We think some three or four yeas a, at the fall term of the court, only 12 bills were found, and at the next spring term only 14. It seems to as that this is over sa average And. So, to be candid, and j Judgmg from the "hand riting on the wall," crime is still dominant in this parish. How about the cost to the parish of the last grsamd jury? Is it pretty heavy?-The People's Banner. The grand jury at the May term of '84 sat 7 days, finding 24 true bills. At the November term of the same year it sat 8 days, had 66 cases presented before it, and found 28 true bills. At the high water May term of '85 it sat 7 days, had 28 cases presented, found 8 true bills, and took no action in 9 cses. At the November term '86 it sat 8 days, examined 44 cases, and found 23 true bills. In May '86, (which we suppose is the year referred to by the Banner) the grand jury sat 7 days and found 14 true bills, in addition to which the district at torney filed 2 informations, bring ing the number up to 160 In last May the grand jury sat 9 days, investigated 52 cases and found 26 true bills. Taking into consideration the petty nature of the crimes for which the 16 bills were lately found, it is a remarkably good showing for our parish, which has increased in population fully one thousand within the last few years. As to the query about the cost to the parish, any one can see at a glance that it is about as usual. The grand jury lost the first day of the term on account of no judge being present, and yet their expense to the parish is very little if any in excess of former grand juries. A Handy Pocket Atlas. An attempt to put in pocket size the contents of a large reference Atlas is usually accompanied by rough, inaccurate, and inelegant engraving and printing, but in the New Pocket Atlu of the World, published by Ivison, Blaeman & Co., 753 & 7566 Broadway, New York, this is not the fact Ninety one maps containing nearly every geographical point of interest throughout the world, are given, and eachis a gem of the agraver's art Delicately yet distiratly eel ored, these maps are quisite illnstrations of the best o8or printing to-day obtainabl.

Mc a Enery's "personal" appointments, we this week give them the list of the police jurors elected by the people of Winn parish, and the appointments made by the gov ernor. We do not like to give particulars of this "personal" na ture, but, if is demanded, we have more in reserve that can and will be published to substantiate charges that have appeared in our columns, all of them as comelusive as these, and some of them nearer home : wn . r. r It will be observed that only in Sthe cases of the t and 7th wards were the same men appointed who were elected by the people, and they are said to be McEnery men. In justice to Mr. Perrie,ot the 5th ward, we will state that he returned his commission to the governor, saying that another man had been Selected and he would therefore not accept the position. This had no effect on the governor, and instead of appointing the peoples' choice, he appointed Will A. Strong as police juror of ward 5. N. W. Ayer A Son's Ameriea Newspaper Annual. The one thing needed to place N. W. Ayer & Son's American Newspaper Annual incomparably above any work of its elass was the names of Editors and Publish ers. This want has been supplied in the edition for 1887, now betlre us. The edition under review has several such additions. Besides the names of Editors and Pub lishers noted above, it gives the subscription price of each paper, and street address in cities of 50, 000 inhabitants and upward. The' method of giving the political statistics has been changed from the plan heretofore in use, in that the vote of each political party is given by States and counties in- I stead of simply the majorities or pluralities. In the matter of pope- i latio muh has been done in the effort to bring the reports as nearly as possible abreast with the times. i Owing to the rapid growth of pop. ulation, espeeially in some parts I of the country, the census of 1880 is of little value. The census of 1886 has been used in all those States in which such census was taken. While in the estimated i population some of the fguresasy be open to eriticism, they appear in the main to be approximately  correct. It is set, earriagefree, for $ 00, by the Publishers, Philadelphia, Pa. t fTh ,m.nemmet me, The PlMeth Cmg , obere asem hled vth, corests of his ammtrs aod Zeolmr, et the eAse a nd idghtTerrit·feriald ~s The Soe-d am eontlse tHlO-ala o tso tsirsy.seves Demsrsse, meg theb formr the unaesrl s i Tae lg kiemi0 VIgela These J.e.ielate, oSemsematle, h I aM bee a uas ber et aly di aneeesas heyb are kda.
