SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY EXTRA. WOODSFIELD, OHIO, DECEMBFR 6. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. FtUote tititetu of the Senate and House ef Representative: Throughout the year, since our last meeting, the untry dm been eminently prosperous in all it mite ami in teres Ls, The general health hat been exoelltnt, ar laireste hare been abundant, and plenty smiles throughout the land. Oar commerce and manufacture! have been prosecuted with energy and industry, and lave yielded fair and ample returns. In short, no na tion In the tide of time has ever presented a spectacle of greater material prosperity than we have don until within a very recent period. Way is it, then, that discontent now so extensively prevails, and the Union of the States, which Is the eoaree of all these blessings, is threatened with destruc tion f The long-continued and Intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery in flit Southern Slates has at length produced Its natural effects. The different sections of the Union are now ar rayed against each other, and the time has arrived, so much dreaded by the Father of his Country, when hos tile geographical parties have been formed. I have long foreseen, and often forewarned my countrymen of the aow unpenning aaogcr. -ints does cot proceed solely from the claim on the tiart of Canwrmwu nr fb T. A t Legislatures to exclude slavery from the T-ritories. nor I from the efforts of different States to defeat the execu tion of the fugitive slave law. All or any of these evils might hare been endured by the South without danger to the Union, (as others have been,) in the hope that time and reflection might apply the remedy. The immediate peril arise not so mucta from these causes as from the fact that the Incessant and violent agitation of the sla very question throughout the North for the last quarter of a century, has at length produced it malign Influence n the slaves, and Inspired them with vague Lotions of freedom Hence a sense of security no longer exists round the family altar. This feeling of peace at home has given place to apprehensions of servile insurrection. Many a matron throughout the 8outh retires at night in dread of what may befall herself and her children before (he morning. Should this apprehension of domestic danger, whether real or imaginary, extend and intensify Itself until it shall pervade the masses of the Southern people, then disunion will become inevitable. Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and has been im planted in the heart of man by his Creator for the wisest purpose ; and oo political union, however fraught with blessings and oenents in an otner respects, can long con- ; tinue, if the necessary consequence be to render the homes and the firesides of nearly half the parties to it habitually and hopelessly insecure. Sooner or later the bonds of such a Union must be severed. It is my conviction that this fatal period has not yet arrived ; and my prayer to God is that He would preserve the Consti tution and the Union throughout all generations. Bat let us take warning in time, and remove the cause of danger. It cannot be denied that, for five and twenty years, the agitation at the North against slavery tn the South has been incessant. In 1835 pictorial hand bills, and inflammatory appeals, were circulated extensively throughout the South, of a character to excite the pas sions of the slaves; and in ths language of General Jack M, "to stimulate them to insurrection, and produce all the horrors of a servile war." This agitation has ever ' since been continued by the public press, by the proceed - tags of State and county conventions, and by abolition sermons and lectures. The time of Congress has been occupied in violent speeches on this never-erding sub ject; and appeals in pamphlet and other forms, endorsed tar distinguished names, have been sent forth from this central point, and spread broad oast over the Union. How easy would it be for the American people to settle the slavery question forever, and to restore peace and harmony to this distracted cou try . They, and they alone, can do it. All that Is necessary to accomplish the object, and all for which the slave States have ever contended, is to be let alone, and per Bitted to manage their domestic institutions in their own way As sovereign States, they, and they alone, are responsible before God and the world for the slavery ex lsting among them. For this, the people of the North are not more responsible, snd, have no more right to in terf ere, than withjslmilar institutions in Russia or in Bra 11. Upon their good sense and patriotic forbearance I con - fess I still greatly rely. Without their aid it is beyond the power of any President, no matter what may be his own political proclivities, to restore peace and harmony among the States. Wisely limited and restrained as Is his powor, under onr Constitution and laws, he alone can accomplish lut little, for good or for evil, on such a mo mentous question. And this brings me to observe that the election of any one of our fellow-citizens to the office of President does not of itself afford just cause for dissolving the Union. This is more especially true if his election has been effect ed by a mere plurality, and not a majority, of the peo ple, and has resulted from transient and temporary causes, which may probably never again occur. In or der to justify a resort to revolutionary resistance, the Federal Government must be gnilty of ''adeltberate, pal pable, and dangerous exercise" of powers not granted by the Constitution. The late presidential election, how ever, has been held in strict conform tty with its express provisions. How, then, can the result justify a revolu tion to destroy Ibis very Constitution? Reason, justice, a reirard for the Constitution, all require that we shall wait for some overt and dangerous act on the part of the I Presidentelect before resorting to such a remedy. It Is said, however that the antecedents of the Presi dent elect have been sufficient to justify the fears of the ' South that he will attempt to invade their constitutional j lights. But are such apprehensions of contingent dan- ger in the future sufficient to justify the immediate des traction of the noblest system of government ever de- vised by mortals? From the very nature of his office, and its high responsibilities, he mnst necessarily be con- tervative. The stern duty of admin it tring the vast and j complicated concerns of this Government affords in it elf a guarantee that he will not attempt any violation of clear constitutional right. After all, he is no more j than the chief oxecutive officer of the Government . His province is not to make, but to execute, the laws; and it is a remarkable fact in our history, that not withstanding the repeated efforts of the anti-slavery par ty, no single act has ever passed Congress, unless we may possibly except the Missouri Compromise imparing, in the slightest degree, the lights of the Booth to their property in slaves. And it may also be observed, judg ing from present Indications, that no probability ex ists of the passage of such an act, by a majority of both! Houses, either in the present or the. next congres'. Surely under these circumstances, we ought to be restrained from present action by the precept of Him who spake as j never man spoke, that "sfliciei.t unto the day is the evil thereof." The day of evil may never come, unless we shall rashly bring it upon ounelve . It is alleged ss one cause for immediate secession that the Southern States are denied equal rights with the other States In the common Territories. But by what authority are these denied? Not by Congress, which hae never passed, and I believe never will pass, any act to exclude slavery from these Territories; and certainly net by the Supreme Court, which has solemnly decided that slaves we property, and, like all other property, their owners have a right to take them into the common Territories, and hold them there under the protection of the Consti tution. So far, then, as Congress is concerned, the objection is not to anything they have already done, bat to what they may do hereafter. It will surely be admitted that this apprehension of future danger is no good reason for an immediate dissolution of the Union. It is true that the territorial legislature of Kansas, on the 23d of Febru ary, 18t0. passed in great haste an act, over the veto of the governor, declaring that slavery "is, and shall be, forever prohibited in this Territory. " Such an act, how ever plainly violating the rights of property secured by the Constitution, will surely be declared void by the ju diciary whenever it shall be presented in a legal form. Only three days after my inauguration the Supreme Court of the United States solemnly adjudgtd that this powecdid net exist In a territorial legislature. Yet such has been the factious temper of the times that the correctness of this decision has been extensively impugn ed before the people, and the question has given rise to angry political cocfiicts throughout the country. Those who have appealed from this judgment of our highest const! utional tribunal to popular assemblies would, if they could, invest a territorial legislature with power to annul the sacred rights of property. This power Congress is expressly forbidden by the Federal Constitu tion to exercise. Every State legislature in the Union is forbidden by its own constitution to exercise it. It cannot be exercised in any State except by the people in their highest sovereign capacity when framing or amend tag their State constitution. In like manner, it can only be exercised by the people of a Territory represented in a convention of delegates for the purpose of framing a constitution preparatory to admission as a 8 ate into the Union. Then, and net until then, are they invested with newer to decide the question whether slavery assail or shall not exist within their limits. This is an act ef sovereign authority, axu cot ci su.orainate territorial legislation Where it otherwise, then indeed would the .. . . . . . . . . - equality oi me uosiroyou, ana thel right of prcperty in slaves would depent1, not upon the guarantees of the Constitution, but upon th shifting majorities of an irresponsible territorial Iegila- nr. Kmch a doctrine, irom us intrinsic unsoundness. cannot long influence any considerable portion of our people, much lets can it afford a good reaton for a dis solution of the Union. The moat pa pable violations of (constitutional doty which have yet been committed consist in the act of different State legislatures to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law. It ought to be remembered, however, that for these act, neither Congress nor any President can Justly be held responsible. Having oeen passed in Violation of the Federal Constitution, they are therefore ..iintiYnU. All the courts, both State and national before whom the question has arisen, hare from the te- u nr. Tiff tleCiareu llic iukhhc siaiciaw w DC CPUBtltlM tional. The single exception is that of a State court IdJ Wisconsin; and this has not only been reversed by the proper appellate triounai, out nasmei wnn sucn univer sal reprobation that there can be no danger from it as a precedent. The validity of t his law has been eatablished ever and over again by the Supreme Court of me United Btates with perfect unanimity. It is founded upon an ex press provision of the Conatitutlon, requiring that fugitive lave who escape from service in one State to another shall be "delivered up" to their masters. Without this provision it is a well-known historical fact that the Con stitution Itself could never have been adopted by the Con vention. In one form or other under the acts of 1793 and 1850, both being substantially the same, the fugi tive slave law has been the law cf the land from the dajs of Washington until the present moment. Here, then, a clear case Is presented, in which it will be the duty of the next Presidents as it hat been my own, to act with vigor In executing this supreme law against the conflict- lng enactments of State Legislatures. Should he fail in the performance of this high duty, he will then have manifested a disregard of the Constitution and laws, to the great injury of the people of nearly one half of th States of the Union. But are we to presume In advance that he will thus violate his duty? This would be at war with every principle of justice andVotOhristian char- ity. let us wait for the overt act. The-ftj lUgltl- ;ie slave law has been carried into execntion in every contested case since the commencement of the present administra tion; though oftenit is to be regretted, with great loss and inconveaienenn the master, and with considerable expense to the gosSinment. Let us trust that the State legislatures will repeal their unconstitutional and obnox ious enactments. Unless this shall be dose without un necessary delay, it is impossible for any human power (o save Us Union. lesv The Southern States, s tan diss; on the basis of the Con stitutfon, have a right to demand this actof Justice from the Btates of the North. Should It be refused, then the Constitution, to which all the Btates are partis will have oemwuuuiij vBswwu "r iwi"v . ...vm ,u .ton eseential to the dome.tic eecurlty and happineee of tha remainder. In that event, the injured States, after having first nsed all peaceful and constitutional means to ODiain redress, wonld be jus tinea tn revolutionary resist ance to the Government of the Union, I hare purposely confine 1 my remarks t revolution ary resistance, because . it has been claimed within the last few years that any State, whenever this shall belts sovereign will and pleasure, may secede from the Union, in accordance with the Constitution, snd without any violation of the constitutional rights of the other members of the Confederacy. That as each became parties to the Union by the rote of its own people assembled In Con vention , so any one of them may retire from the Union in a similar manner by the vote of such a convention. In order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy it must be on the' principle that the Federal Government is a mere voluntary association of States, to be dissolved at pleasure by any one of the contracting parties. If this be so, the Confederacy is a rope of sand, to be pene trated and dissolved by the first adverse wave of public opinion in any of the States. In this manner our thirty three Btates may resolve themselves Into as many petty, Jarring, and hostile republics, each one retiring from the Union, without responsibility, whenever any sudden ex citement might impel them to such a course. By this process a Union might be entirely broken into fragments in a few weeks, which cost our forefatheis many years of ton, privation, and blood to establish. Cook a principle is wholly inconsistent with the his tory at well as the character of the Federal Constitution. Alter tt was framed, with the greatest deliberation and care, it was submitted to conventions of the people of the several States for ratification. Its provisions were discussed at length In these bodies, composed of the first men or the country, its opponents contended tnat it conferred powers upon the Federal Government danger ous to the lights of the States, whilst its advocates main tained that under a fair construction of the instrument there was no foundation for such apprehensions. In that mighty straggle between the first intellects of this or any other country, It never occurred to any individual either amoni its opponents or advocatos. to assert, or "en to t",-te. that their efforts were all vain labor, because the moment that any State felt herself aggrieved she might secede from the Union. Wht a crushing ar gument would this have proved against those who dreided that the rights of the States would be endan gered by the Constitution. The truth is, that it was not until manv years after the origin of the Federal Govern ment that such a proposition was first advanced. It was then met and refuted by the conclusive arguments of General Jackson, who in his message of 16th January, 1833, transmitting the nullifying ordinance of South Car olina to Congress, employs the following language : "The right of the people of a single State to absolve themselves at will, and without the consent of the other States, from their most solemn obligations, and hazard the liberty and happiness of the millions composing this Union, cannot be acknowledged. Such authority is b i liered to be utterly repugnant both to the principles upon which the General Government is constituted and to the objects which it was expressly formed to attain." It is not protended that any clause in the Constitution gives countenance to such a theory. It is altogether founded upon inference, not from any language contain ed In the Instrument itself, but from the sovereign char acter of the several States by which it wai ratified. But is it beyond the power of a State, like an Individual, to yield a portion of its sovereign rights to secure the re mainder? In the language of Mr. Malison, who has been called the father of the Constitution: '-It was form ed by the States that is. by the people in each of the Btates, acting in their highest sovereign capacity; and formed consequently by the same authority which formed the State constitutions." "Nor is the Government of the United States, created by the Constitution, less a Government In the strict sense of the term, within the sphere of its powers, than the governments created by the constitutions of the States are, within their several spheres, it is like them, or ganized into legislative, executive, and judiciary depart ment. It operates, like tnem, directly on persons and things; and, like them, it has at command a physical force for executing the powers committed to it." It was intended to be perpetual, and not to be annulled at the pleasure of any one of the contracting parties. The old articles of confederation were entitled "Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the States;" and by the 13th article It is expressly declared that "the articles of tin Confederation shall beinviola bly observed by every State, and the Union shall be per Setual." The preamble to the Constitution of the United fates, having express reference to the articles of Con federation, recites that it was established "in order to form a more perfect union." And yet it is contended that this "more perfect union' does not include the es sential attribute ot perpetuity. But that the Union was designed to be perpetual sp- pears conclusively from the nature and extent of the powers conferred fat the Constitution on the Federal Government. The. e powers embrace the very nignest attributes .f national sovereignty. They place both the sword and the puree under its control. Congress has power to make war, and to make peace; to raise and support armies and navies, and to conclude treaties with foreign governments. It is invested with the power to coin money, and to regulate the value thereof, and regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States. It is not necessary to enumerate the other high powers which have been conferred upon th Federal Government. In order to carry the enumerated powers into effect, Congress possesses the exclusive right to lay and collect duties on Imports, and in common with the States to lay and collect all other taxes. But the Constitution has not only conferred these high powers upon Congress but it has adopted effectual mean to restrain the States from interfering with their exercise For that purpose it has, in strong prohibitory language. expressly declared that "no State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and ."reprisal: coin money; emit bills of credit; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, pasj any bill ot attainder, ex post ratio law, or law impairing the obligation ot contracts. moreover, "without the consent of Congress, no State shall lsy any imposts or dutieB on any imports or exports, except what may be absolutely '.necessary tor executing us in speciion laws;" and, if they exceed this amount, the ex s ahull blnnor to thii United Stales. lay an, duty o tonnage; keep troops, orships of war, And "no state snail, witnout tne consent oi jcngr.iF3 time of peace; enter into any agreemtnt or cou pact with another State, or with a foreign power; or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent can ger as will not admit of delas." In order still further to secure the'uninterrupted exer cise of these high powers against State interpositicn, it i- provided "tint tint Coistituti .n and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance tnereoi; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land ; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding " The solemn sanction of religion has been superadded to tha obligations of official duty, and all senators and rep resentatives of the United Btates, all members of State legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, "bo of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by ca'.B or affirmation to support this Constitu tion." in order to carry into effect these powers, the Constitu tion has established a perfect Government in all Its forms, Legislative, Executive, and Judicial, and this Govern ment, to the extent of its powers, acts directly upon the individtial citizens of every State, and executes its own decrees by the agency of it own officers. In this respect It differs entirely irom the Government under the old Confederation, which was confined to making requisi tions on the States in their sovereign character. This left it in the discretion of each whether to obey or to re fuse, and they often declined to comply with such requi sitions. It thus became necessary, for the purpose of removing this barrier, and ""in order to form a more per fectUnien," to establish 'a Government which could act diiectly upon the people, and execute its own laws with out the Intermediate sgency of the Btates. This ha been accomplished by the Constitution of the United States. In short, the Government created by the Constitution, and deriving itt authority trom the sovereign people of each of the several Btatts, has precisely the same right to exercise its power over the people of an? these States, in the enumerated cases, that each one of them possesses over subjects not delegated to theUnited States, but "re served to the States respectively, or to the people." To the extent of the delegated powers the Constitution of the United Btates is as much a part of the constitution of each State, and is as binding upon its people as though It had been textually inserted therein. This Government, therefore, is a great and powerful Government, invested with all the attributes of sovereign ty over the special subjects to which. its authority extends. Its fiamers never intended to implant in its bosom the seeds of its own destruction, nor were they at its creation guilty of the absurdity of providing for its own dissolu tion. It was not intended by it framer to be the base less fabric of a vision which at the touch of the enchanter would vanish into thin air, but a substantial and mi. hty fabric capable of resisting the slow decay of time and of defying the stoims ot ages, inaeea, wen may tne jealous patriots of .that day have indulged fears that a govern ment of such hizh powers might violate the reserved rights of the State, and wisely did they adopt the rule of a strict construction oi uiese powers to prevent tne danger! But they did not fear, nor had they any reason to imaaine. that the Constitution would ever be so In terpreted as to enable any State, by her own act, and without the consent of her sister States, to diacbarg her people from all or any of their Federal obligations I AklUBJ W It may be asked, men. are me peop'e ot tne states . without redrew against the tyranny and oppression of i the Federal Government? By no means. The right of resistance on the part of me governed against the op- I presslonof their government cannot be denied. It ex j brts independentty of all constitutions, and has been ex erci,ed at all period of the world' history. Under i old governments have been destroyed, ana new ones have taken their place. It is embodied in strong and express language in onr own declaration oi indepen dence. But the distinction must ever be observed, that this is revolution against an established uovernment, an not a voluntary secession from it by virtue of an inhe rent constitutional right. In short, let us look the dan ger fairly in the face : Secession is neither more nor less than revolution It may or may not be a justifiable revolution . but still it is revolution. What, in the meantime, is the responsibility and true nnsition of the Executive 1 He is bound by solemn oath Ore uOu ana me country iu wt.c cure mi wrc raws thfully executed, and irom mis obligation ne can he absolved by any human power.

In fact, the whole machinery of the Federal Government, necessary for the distribution of remedial justice amon i the people, has been demolished and it would be difficult. If not impossible, to replace it The only acts of Congress on the statute-book, bearing noon this subject, are mose oi me xotn reoruary, ix and 3d March, 1807.

The bare enumeration of these provisions proves how inadequate they are without further legislation to over come a united opposition in a single State, not to speak of other States who may place themselves in a similar at titude. Congress alone has power to decide whether the present laws can or cannot be amended to as to carry oat more effectually the objects of the Constitution. The same insuperable obstacles do net lie in the way of exeenfjag the lawa for the collection of the cuatoma.

This has been purchased for a fair equivalent, "by the consent of the Legislsture of the State,' "Tor tne erection or forts, magazines, arsenals, sr.e and over these the authority "to exercise exclusive legislation" has been expressly granted by the Constitu tion to Congress. It is not believed that any attempt will be made to expell the United States from this prop- rty by iorce; nut h in mis l snoaia prove to oe mistaken. the officer in command of the forts has received orders to act strictly on the defensive. In snch a contingency, i he responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants. Apart irom tne execution or tne laws, so rar as this mar be practicable, th Executive has no authority to decide wnat shall be tne relations between tne federal govern ment and South Carolina. He has been invested with no such discretion He possesses no power to change the relations heretofore existing between them- much less to acknowledge the independence of that State. This would be to Invest a mere Executive officer with the power of recognising the dissolution of the Confeder acy among our thirty-three sovereign States. It bears no resemblance to tne recognition of a foreign de facto government, involving no such responsibility. Any at tempt to do this wonld, on his part, be a naked act of usurpation. It Is therefore, my duty to submit to Con grers the whole question in all its bearings. The course ef events is so rapidly hastening forward, that the emer gency may soon arise, when you may be called upon to decide th mementous question whether you posses the power, ny iorce ot arms, to compel a state to remain tn the Union. I should feel myself recreant to my duty were I not to expiess an opinlcn on this important uhject. The questien fairly stated ir lias the Constitution delegated to Congress the power to coerce a State inte submission which is attempting to withdraw or has ac tually withdrawn from the Confederacy? If answered In the offirmattve, it must been the principle that the power has been conferred upon Congress to declare and to make war against a state, a t ter much serious reflec tion I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress or to any other depart ment of the Federal Government. It is manifest, upon an inspection of the Constitution, that this is not among thespeciflc and enumerated powers granted te Congress: and it is equally apparent that its exercise is not "neces sary and proper tor carry leg Into execution' any one of these power. So far from this poser having been dele gated to Congress, it was expressly refused by the con vention which framed the Constitution. It appears, from the proceedings of that body that on the 31st May. 1737, the clause "auihorieina an exer tion of th force of the whole against a delinquent tit ate " came up for consideration. Mr. Madison op posed it in a brief but powerful speech, from which I shillextract but a single sentence. He observed: "The use of force against a State would look more like a dec laration of war than an n ruction of punishment; and would probably te considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which It might be bound." Upon bis motion the clause was unanimous- it uunuuiieu, uiu was uevcr i ueiicve attain presentea. Soon afterwards, on the 8th June, 1787, when inclden- ! tally adverting to the subject, he said: "Any Govem- ment for the United States, formed on the supposed prac- ' ticability of using force against the unconstitutional pro- ! ceedinw of the States, would prove as visiouarv and fal- ! lacioas as the government of Congress," evidently meaning the then existing Congress of the old Confede ration. Without descending to particulars, it may b; safely as serted, that the power to make war against a State is at variance with the whole spirit and intent of th Constitu tion. Suppose such a war should result in the conquest of a state, how are we to govern it afterwards .' Snail we hold it as a province, and govern It by despotic pow- berV.Tr er e V mnX.." 'e"ow,ltlie?

But. If we possessed this power, would it be wise to ex ercise It under existing sircumstances ? The elject would doubtless be to preserve the Union. War would not on ly present the most effectual means ot destroying It; bat wonld banish all hope of its peaceable reconstruction. Betides, in the fiaternal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be expended, rendeting future recon ci tiation between the States Impossible. In the mean time, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence? The fact is, tnat our union rests upon public opinion. and can never be cemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it cannot live in the affections of the people, it must one day perish. Congress possess many means cf preserving it by conciliation; but the sword was not placed in their hand to preserve it by force But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my coun trymen to pause and deliberate, before they determine to destroy this, the grandest terrpie which has ever been dedicated to bnman fieedom since the world began? It has teen consecrated by the blood of our fathers, by ths glories of the past, and by the hopes of the future. The Union has already made us the most prosperous and, ere long, will, if preserved, render us the most powerful na tion on the face of the ea- th. In every foreign region of tte globe, the title of American citizen is held In the ' hiahest respect, and when pronounced in a foreign land it causes the hearts of cur countrymen to swell with honest pride. Surely, when we reach the brink of the yawning abjss. we shall recoil with horror from the last fatal plunge. By such a dread catastrophe, tte hopes of the friends of freedom throughout the world would be destroyed, and a long night of leaden despotism won d i enshroud the cations. Our example for more than eighty years would not only be lost, but it would be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit for self-government. It is not every wrong nay, it is net every grievous wrong which can justify a resort to such a fearful alter native. This ought to be the last desperate remedy of a despairing people, after every other constitutional means of conciliation had been eh usted. We should reflect that under this free Government there is an incessant ebb and flow in public opinion. The slavery question, j like everj thing human, will have its day. I firmly be- j lievo that it has already reached and passed the culmina ting point. But if, in the midst of the existing excite- ! ment. the Union shall perish, the evil may then become irreparable. CoDgress can contribute mu h to aveitit by proposing and recommending to the Legislatures of the several States the remedy tor existing evils, which the Constitution has itself provided for its own preservation This has been tried at different critical periods of oar history, and alwsys with eminent success. It it to be found in the 5th article providing for itso-.tr. amendment. Under this article amendments have been proposed by twn.tVi 1 nla r f In th hnncPH nf Piinfn'. Ann llav h..n " ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the sev- eral States." and have consequently become parts of the Constitution. To this process the country is indebted for the clause prohibiting Congress from passing any law respecting an establishment of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or of the right of peti- tion. To this we are also indebted for the Bill of Rights, which secures the people against any abuaettf power by the Federal Government. Such were the apprehensions justly entertained by the friends of State Bights at that period as to nave renuereu it cAiremeiy uououui wneiner the Constitution could have long survived without these amendments. Again, the Constitution was amended by the same pro cess after the election ot President Jefferson by the House of Representatives, in February, 1803. This amend ment was rendered necessary to prevents recurrence of the dangers which had set iously threatened the existence of the Government during the pendency of that election The article fer us own amendment was intended to; se- cure tne amicahieauiusimentciconuicuni constitutional questions like the present, which might arise between (he governments of the States and that of the United States. This appears from contemporaneous history. In this connection, 1 shall merely can attention to a row sentences in Mr. Madison's justly-celebrated report in 17. 'J, to the legislature of Virginia. In this he ably and conclusively defended the resolutions cf the preceding legislature against the strictures of several other State legis'atures. These were mainly founded upon the pro test of the Virginia legislature againtt the "Alien and edition Acts," as "palpable and alarming Infractions of the Constitution.'' In pointing out the pescefal and constitutional remedies, and he referred to none other, to which the States were authorized to resort, on sneh oc casion, he concludes by .saying, "that the legislature of the States might have made a direct representation to Congress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two j China has produced the most satisfactory results.

The con- tion on their part of the territorial government estab- meieot wouia propose an explanatory Hiuenumeni to me Constitution, or two-thirds of themselves, if inch had been their option, might, by an application to Congreaa, have obtained a convention for Ihe same object." This Is me very course which I earnestly recommend In order to obtain an "explanatory amendment" of the Con stitution on the subject of slavery. This might originate with Congress or the State legislatures, as may be deemed most advisable to obtain the.object The explanatory amendment might be confined to the final settlement of the true construction of the Constitu tion on three special points: 1. An express recognition of the right of property in slaves in the Statet where it now exittt or may hereafter exist. 2. The duty of protecting this right in all the common Territories throughout their territorial existence, and until they shall be admitted as States into the Union, aith or without slavery, at their constitutions may pre scribe. 3. A like iccognition cf the right of the master to have his slave, who has escaped from one State to another, re stored and "delivered up" to him, and of the validity of the fugitive slave law enacted for this purpose, together with a declaration that all State laws imparing or de feating this light are violations of the Constitution, and are consequently null and void. It may be objected that this construction of the Con stitution ha already been settled by the Supreme Court ef the United States, and whatmore ought to be required? The answer is. that a very large proportion of the people of the United States still contest the correctness of this decision, and never will cease from agitation and admit its binding force until clearly established by the people of the several States in their sovereign character. Such an explanatory amendment would, it is believed, forever terminate the existing dissensions and restore peace and harmony among the States. It ought not to be doubted that snch an appeal to the arbitrament established by the Constitution iiself would be received with favor by all the States of the Confeder acy. In any event it ought to be tried in a spirit of con ciliation before any at these States shall separate them selves from the Union. When I entered npon the duties of the Presidential office, the aspect neither jf our foreign nor domestic af fairs was at all satisfactory We were involved in dan gerous complications with several nations, and two of our Territories were in a state of isvoluticn against th Government. A restoration of the African slave trade had. numerous and powerful advocates. Unlawful mill tary expeditions were countansnced by many of our citi zens, and were suffered, in defiance ef the effort of the Uovernment, to escape from ousfpores tor the purpose of making war upon the unoffending people of neighbor ing i epublict with whom we were at peace. In addition to these and other difficulties, we experienced a revulsion in monetary affairs, soon after my advent to power, of unexampled severity, and of ruinous consequences to all the great interests of the country. When we take a re trospect of what was then oar condition and contrast this with its materlMprosperity at the time of ithe late Presidential election, we have abundant reason tojreturn onr ermteful thanks to that merciful Providence which has never forsaken us as a nation in all oar past trials. OUR 

FORE ION RELATIONS. GREAT BRITAIN. Our relations with Great Britain ere of the most friend ly character. Since the commencement cf my admin is- trtlr.n. ihe two dangerous questions, arising from the ninvton and Bulwer treaty and from the right of search claimed by the British government, have been amicably and honorably adjusted. The discordant constructions of the Clayton and Bul wer treaty between the two governments, which, at dif ferent periods of the discussion, bore a threatening as pect, have resulted in a final settlement entirely satis factory to this Government. In my last annual mes sage I Informed Congress that the British government : ,. ir(Qj ,,, n,- asm not "" ... - the understanding between the two government. It 1 neverineiess conndently expected that tbis good work will ere long be accomplished." This confident expecta tion ha since been fulfilled. Her Britannic Majesty concluded a treaty with Honduras on the 38th November, 1859, and with Nicaragua on the 28th August, I860, re linquishing the Mosquito protectorate. Besides, by the former, the Bay Islands are recognised a a part of the republic of Honduras. It may be observed thatjthe stip ulations of these treaties conform tn evenr imnorhuit particular to the amendments adopted by the Senate of the United States to the treaty concluded at London on tne iitn uctoner, iron, between the two governments. Itwill be recollected that this treaty was rejected by the British government because of it objection to th just and important amendment of the Senate to the article re lating to Rnstan and the other islands in ths Bay of Honduras. It must be a source of sincere satisfaction to all slass e of our fellow-citizen, and especially to those engag ed In foreign commerce, that the claim, on the part ef Great Britain, forcibly to visit and search American mer chant vessels on the high sees In time of peace, has been abandoned. This was by far the most dangerous question to the peace of the two countries which ha existed since the war of 1812. Whilst it remained open, they might at any moment have been precipitated into a war. This was rendered manifest by the exasperated state of public feeling throughout our entire country, produced by the forcible search of American merchant vessels by British cruisers on the coast of Cuba, in th Spring of 1858. The American people hailed with general acclaim the or ders of the Secretary of the Navy to our naval force in the Gulf of Mexico, "to protect all vessel ot the United States on the high sea from search or detention by the vessels-of-war of any other nation." These orders might have produced an immediate collision between the naval forces of the two countries. This wa most fortunately prevented by an appeal to theiustice of Great Rritaln and to the law of nations as expounded by her own most eminent jurist. The only question of any importance which still rl- mains open is the disputed title between the two govern ments to the island of San Juan, in the vicinity of Washington Territory. As this question is still under negotiation, it is not deemed advisable at the present mo ment to make any other allusion to the subject. The recent visit of the Prince of Wales, in a private character, to the people of this country, hat proved to be a most auspicious event In its consequences, it can not fail to increase the kindred and kindly feelings which I trust may ever actuate the government and people of both countrie in their political and social intercourse with each other. rs 

ARCS. With France, our ancient and powe 1 ul ally, our rela tions continue to be of the most friendly character. A decision has recently been made by a French judicial tri banal, with the approbation of the Imperial Government, which cannot fail to foster the sentiments of mutual re gard that have so long existed between the two countries. Under the French law no person can serve in the armies or Jfrance unless he be a French citizen. The law of , , - - - v. i??" iouows as a necessary consequence that a Frenchman, by i4" ' hVnVert hi. TllT. .1" ,1 ? . "2 S 2? "" "STE rn, TfiSS h" ,ol,t WV.a,iTe ChT a?'er. "? cannot, therefore, be compslled to serve In the French armies in case he should return tn hi. nntlvo country. These principles were announced in 1852 by the French Minister of War, and in two late cases have been confirmed by the French judiciary In these, two natives of France have been discharged from the r rench army because they had become American citizens. To employ the language of our present minister to France, wno nas rendered good service on. this occasion, "I do r&Jg2ZZi e sTm. wue our Government is bound to protect the rights of our naturalized citizens everywhere to the same extent as though they had drawn their first breath in this country We can recognize no distinction between our native and naturalized citizent. .Hits. I Between the great empire of Russia and the United States the mutual friendship and regard which has so long existed still continues to prevail, and, if possible, to increase. Indeed, our relations with that Empire are all that we could detire. tiara Oar relations with 5 pain are now of a more complica ted, though less dangerous character than they have been for many years Our citizens have long held, and con tinue to bold numerons claims against the Spanish gov ernment. These had been ably urged for a seires of years by our successive diplomatic representatives at Madrid, but without obtaining redress. The Spanish government finally agreed to institute a joint commission for the adjustment of these claims, and on the 5th dsy of March, 1860, concluded a convention for this purpose with our present minister at Madrid. Under this con vention, what have been denominated " the Cuban claims," amounting to 9128,635 and 51 cents, in which more 111811 one hundred of our fellow, citizens are inter esled' were recognized, and the Spanish government agreea iq pay iuti,i.uu oi this amount "within three months following the exchmge of ratifications " The payment ot the remaining d j. 51 was to await the decision of the commissioners for or against "the Amistad ' cliim;" but in any event, ths balance was to be paid to the claimants either by Spain or the United States. There term j. I In e every reason to know, are highly; satisfactory to the holders of the Cuban claims. Indeed tney nave made a formal ofler authorizing the State De partment to settle these claim?. and to deduct the amount of the Amistad claim from the sums which they are en titled to receive from Spain. This offer, of course, can not se accepted. All other claims of citizens of the United States against Spain, or of subjects of the Queen of Spain against the United States, including the ' Amistad claim," were by this convention re'erred to aboard of commissioners in the nsual form. Neither the validity of the Amistad claim, nor of any other claim against either party, with the single exception of the Cuban claims, was recognized by the convention. Indeed, the Spanish government did not insist that the validity of the Amistad claim i be thus recognized notwithstanding its payment had been recommended to Congress by two ofmyprede- ! cesiors as well as by myself, and an appropriation for that purpose had passed the Senate of the United States. They were content that it should be submitted to the I board for examination and decision, like the other claims. isoth uovernments were bound respectively to pay the amount awarded to the several claimants, "at such ' times and places as may be fixed by and according to the i noroisaiu awarus- 1 transmitted this convention to the Senate for their constitutional action on the 3d May, 1860, and on the 27th of the succeeding June they determined that they would " not advise and consent" to its ratification, I These proceedings place our relations with Spain in an awkward and embarrassing pesition. It is more than ' probable that the final adjustment of these claims will . -- . I reiterate the recommendation contained in mv An nual Message, of Decemher, 1858, and repeated in that of December, 1859, In favor of the acquisition of Cuba from Spain by fair purchase. I firmly believe that such an acquisition would contribute essentially to the well being and prosperity of both countries in all future time, as well as prove the certain means of Immediately abol- lsmng tne Airican slave trade throughout the world.

AT 'bTP.IA. &C. With the Bmperor of Austria, and the remaing conti nsStal powers of Europe, including that of the Sultan, our relations continue to be of the most friendly char acter. 

CHINA. The friendly and peaceful policy pursued by the Gov- ernment of the United States towards the the emtdre of! vention oi me em of .November, ltae, supplementary to ' thit treaty, for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claims ai our citizens on inina, rererred to in my last Annual Message, bas been already carried into affect, so lar as mis was practicable. Under tbis convention the sum of 500,000 taelt, equal to about $700,000, was stipulated to be paid in satisfac tion of the claims of American citizens, out of the one fifth of the receipts for tonnsge import, and export duties on American vessels at the port of Canton, Bhanghae, and Fuchau; and it was "agreed that this amount shall be in full liquidation of all claims of American citizens at the various parte to thit date." Debentures for this amount to wit: 300,000 taels for Canton, 100,000 for Bhanghae, and 100,000 for Fuchau were delivered ac cording to the terms of th convention by the respective Chinese collectors of the customs of these ports to the agent selected by our minister to receive the tame. Since that time the claims of our citizent have been ad justed by the board of commissioners appointed for that purpose under the act of March 3, 1859, and their award which proved satisfactory to the claimants, have been approved by our minister. In the aggregate they amount to the aum of $198,001 78. The claimant have already received a large proportion of the auma awarded to them out of the fun l provided, and it is confidently expected that the remainder will ere long be entirely paid. After the awards shall have been satisfied, there will remain a surplus ef more than 9200,000 at the disposition of Con gress. As this will in equity belong to the Chines gov ernment, would not justice require its appropriation to some benevolent object in which he Chinese may be spec ially interested? Our minister to China, in obedience to his instructions, has remained perfectly neutral in the war between Great Britain and France and the Chinese empire; although, in conjunction with the Russian minister, he was ever ready and willing, had the opportunity offered, to employ hi gocd offices in restoring peace between the parties. Itis but an act of timple justice, both to our present minister and his predecessrr, to state, that they have proved fully equal to me uencate, trying, ana responsible positions in wheih they have on different occasions bean placed. 

JAFAH. The ratifications of the treaty with Japan concluded at Tedo on the 29th July, 1858, were exchanged at Washing ton on the 22d May last, and the treaty itself wa pro claimed on the succeeding day. There is good reason to expect that, under itt pre tte tion and influence, our trade and intercourse with that distant and interesting people will rapidly increase. The ratifications of the treaty were exchanged with unusual solemnity. For thit purpose, the Tycoon had accredited three of hit meet distinguished subjects as envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentisry, who were received and treated with marked distinction snd kindness both by the Government and people ot the United States. There is every reason to believe that they have returned to their native land entirely satisfied with their visit, and inspired by the most friendly feel logs for our country. Let us ardently hope, in the lan guage of the treaty Itself, that "there shall henceforward be perpetual peace and friendship between the United States or America and 11 is majesty, me Tycoon or Japan and his succetsori." BRAZIL With the wise, conservative, and liberal Government of the Empire of Brazil our relation continue to be of the most amicable character. KEW ORAJSAOA The exchange of the ratification! of the convention with the Republic of New Granada, tigned at Washing ton, on the 10th September, 1857, bas been long delayed from accidental causes, for which neither party is censur able. These ratification were duly exchanged in this city , on the 5th of November last. Thus hat a contro veray been amicably terminated which had become so serious at the period of my inauguration, as to require me, on the 17th April, 1857, to direct our minister to demand hia passports and return to the United Statet. Under this convention the government nf New Gra nada has specially acknowledged itself to be responsible to our citizens "for damage which were caused try the riot at Panama on the 15th April, 1856." These claims, together with other claims of omr citizens which had been long urged In vain, are referred for adjustment to a board of commissioner!. I submit a copy of the con vention to Congress, and recommend the legislation ne cessary to carry it into effect. COSTA RICA AND KlCARAOrA. Persevering effort have been made for the adjustment of the claims of American citizens against the govern ment of Costa Rica, and I am happy to inform yon that these have finally prevailed. A convention was signed at the city of San Jose, on the 2d of July last, between the minister resident of the United States in Cotta Bica and the plenipotentiaries of that Republic, referring these claims to a board of commissioners, and providing for the payment of their awards. This convention will be submitted Immediately to the Senate for their consti tutional action. The claims of our citizent upon the republic of Nica ragua have not yet been provided for by treaty, although diligent effort for ths purpose have been made by our minister resident to that republic. These are still con tinued, with a fair prospect of success. mxioo. Our relations with Mexico ramain in a most unsatis factory condition. In my last two annual messages I discussed extensively the tubject of these relations, and do not now propose to repeat at length the facts and ar guments then presented . They proved conclusively that onr citizens residing in Mexico and our merchants trading thereto had tuffeied a series of wrongs and outrages snch as we have never patiently borne from any other nation. For these oursueesslve ministers, invoking the faith of trettiet, bad, in the name of their country, persistently demanded redress and indemnification, but without the slightest effsct Indeed, so confident had the Mexican authorities become of our patient endurance, that they universally believed they might commit these outrages upon American citizens with absolute Impunity. Thus wrote our minister In 1856, and expressed the opinion that "nothing but a manifestation ef the power of the Govern ment, and of its purpose to punish these wrongs, will avail." Afterwards, In 1857, came the adoption of a new con stitution for Mexico, the election of a President aad Congress under its provisions, and the inauguration of the President. Within one short month, however, this President was expelled from the capital by a rebellion in the army, and the supreme power of the republic wa as signed to General Zaloaga. This usurper was in his turn toon compelled to retire and give place to General Mira mon. Under the constitution which ha thus been adopted, Senor Jnarez, as chief justice of the Supreme Court, be came the lawful President of the Republic; and It was for tne maintenance or tne constitution and his authority derived from it that the civil war commenced, and still continue to be prosecuted Throughout the year 1858 the constlfationa' party grew stronge r and stronger. In ths previous history of Mex ico a successful military revotution at the capital had almost universally been tte signal for submission through ut the republic. Not so on the present occa sion. A majority of the citizens persistently sustained tne constitutional government, when this was recog nised in April, 1850, by the Government of the United Btates, its authority extended over a large majority of the Mexican States and people, including Vera Cruz anl all the other important sea ports of the republic. From that period our commerce with Mexico began to revive. and the constitutional government has afforded it all the protection in their power. Meanwhile, the government of Mlramon still held sway at the capital and over the surrounding country, and continued its outrages against the few American citizent who still had the courage to remain wlth:n its power To cap the climax: After the battle of Tacubaya, In April, 1859, Gen. Marques ordered three citizens of the United states, two of them pbjsic'ans, to be seised in the hospital at that place, taken out snd shot, without crime and without trial. This was done, notwithstanding our unfortunate countrymen were at the moment engaged in th holy cause of affording relief to the soldiers of both parties who had been wounded in th battle, with out making any distinction between them. The time had arrived. In my opinion, when this Gov ernment was bcund to exert its power to avenge and re dress the wrongs of our citizen and to afford them pro tection in Mexiso. Tha Interposing obstacle was that the portion of the country under the sway or Mlramon could not be reached without passing over territory un der the jurisdiction of the constitutional goveinment. Under these circumstances. I deemed it my duty to re commend to Congress, in my last annual message, the employment of a sufficient military force to penetrate into the interior where the government of Miramon was to be found, with, or, if need be, without the consent of the Juarez government, though it wa not doubted that this consent could be obtained . Never have I had a clearer conviction on any subject than of the justice as well as wisdom of such a policy. No other alternative was left, except the entire abandonment of onr fellow citizens who had gone to Mexico, under the faith of trea ties, to the systematic injustice, cruelty, and oppression of Miramon' govemmeut. Besides, it is almest certain that the simple authority to employ this force would of itself have accomplished all our objects without striking a single blow. The constitutional government would then ere this have been established at the city of Mexico, and would have been ready and willing, to the extent of its ability, to do us justice. . In addition and 1 deem this a most important con sideration European governments would have been de prived of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and domestic concerns of Mexico. We should thus bare been relieved from the obligation of resisting, even by force, should this become necessary, any attempt by these gov ernments to deprive our neighboring republic of portions of her territory; a duty from which we could not shrink without abandoning the traditional and established poliey of the American people. lam happy to observe, thst, firmly relying upon the us'ice and good faith of these governments, there is no present danger that such a con tingency will happen. Wiving discovered that my recomxentlat ors would not be sustained by Congress, the next alternative was to accomplish, in some degree, if possible, the same ob jects by treaty stipulations with the constitutional gov- j ernment. Such treaties were accordingly concluded by , lt Ma nrt pvrellont mlniatpr to Mexico. nrt on TiT" .... t , . o.. t ,. . . , . . .. ... - atownnld T. sentadetailed statementof their provisions. BUU I may be permitted to express the opinion in advance, that they are calculated to promote tne agricultural, manufactur ing and commercial interests of the country and to se cure our just influence with an adjoining republic, as to whose fortunes and fate we can never feel indifferent; whilst at the same time they provide for the payment of a considerable amount towards the satisfaction of the claims of our injured fellow-citizens, 

KANSAS AM) ' TAIL At the period of my inauguration I was confronted in Kansas by a revolutionary government, existing under what is called the Topeka constitution. Its avowed object was to subdue the territorial government by force, and to inaugurate what was called the Topeka govern ment Inits stead. To accomplish this object an extensive military organization was formed and its command en- j trusted to the most violent revolutionary leaders. Un- der these circumstances, it became my imperative duty j to prevent the flames of civil war from again raging in Kansas, which, in the excited state of the publiomind, both North 3ad 8outhi might have extended into ths - hnrimr st tes. nelghborinir St tes The hostile parties in Kansas bail been inflamed a gainst each other by emissaries both from the forth and the South, to a degree of malignity without parallel in our history. To prevent actual collision, and to assist the civil magistrates in enforcing the laws, a strong de tachment cf the army was stationed in the Territory ready to aid the marshal and his deputies, when lawfully called npon as a posse comilatut in the execution of civ il and criminal process. Still, the troubles in Kansas could not have been per manently settled without an election by the people. The ballot box is the sorest arbiter of disputes among free men . Under this conviction, every proper effort was em ployed to induce the hostile parties to vote at the election of delegates to frame a State constitution, and afterwards at tie election to decide whether Kansas should be a t lished by Congress. A better spirit, however, seemed ' soon after to prevail, and the two partiea met face to face at the third election, held on the first Monday of Jan uary. 1858, for members of the legislature and State of ficers under the Lecompton constitution. The result was the triumph of the anti-slavery party at the polls. This decision of the ballot-box proved clearly that this party were in the majority, and removed the danger of civil war. From that time we have heard little or noth ing of the Topeka government; and all serious danger of revolution tion ary troubles in Kansas was then at an end The Lecompton constitution, which had been thus re cognised at this State t lection by the votes of both po litical partiea in Kansas, was transmitted to me with the request that I should present it to Congres. This I could not have refused to do without violating my clear est and ttrongett convic'iont of duty. The constitution, and all the proceedings which preceded and followed its formation, were fairand regular on their face. I then believed, and experience has proved, that the interests of the people of Kansas would have been beat consulted by its admission as a State into the Union, especially as th majority, within a brief period, could have amended the constitution according to their will and pleasure. If fraud existed in all or any of these pioceedings, it wa not for the President, but for Congress, to investigate and determine the question of fraud, and what ought to be its consequences. If, at the two first elections, the majority refused to vote, it cannot be pretended that this refusal to exercise the elective franchise could in validate an election fairly held under lawful authority, even if they had not subsequently voted at the third election. It is true that the whole constitution hid not been submitted to the people, a I always desired; but the precedents are numerous of the admission of States into the Union without such submission. It wonld not comport with my present purpose to re view the proceedings of Congress upon the Lecompton constitution It is sufficient to observe that their final action hss removed the last vestige of serious revolu tionary troubles. The desperate band recently assem bled, under a notorious outlaw, in the southern portion of the Territory, to resist the execution of the laws and to plunder peaceful citizens, will, I doubt not, be speed ily subdued and brought to justice. Had I treated the Lecompton Constitution as a nullity, and refused to transmit it to Congress, it is not difficult to .imagine, whilst recalling the position of the country at that moment, what would have been the disastrous consequences, both in and out of the Territory, from such a dereliction of duty on the part of the XXecuti ve Peace has also been restored within the Territory of Utah, which, at the commencement of my Administra tion, wa in a date of open rebellion. This was the more dangerous, ss the people, animated by a fanatical tpirit, and entrenched within their distant mountain fast nesses . might have made a long and formidable resistance. Cost what it might, it wss necessary to bring them into subjection to the Constitution and the laws. Bound pol icy, therefore, a, well as humanity, required that this object shonld, if possible, be accomplished without the effusion of blood. This conld only be effected by sending a military force into the Territory sufficiently strong to convince the people that resistance would be hopeless, and at the same time to offer them a pardon for past offences on condition of immediate submission to the Government. Tbis policy was pursued with eminent success ; and the only cause for regret la the heavy ex penditure required to march a large detachment of the army to that remote region, and to furnish It subsistence. Utah is now comparatively peaceful and quiet, and the military force hat been withdrawn, except that portion of it necessary to keep the Indians in check, and to pro tect the emigrant train on their way to our Pacific pos sessions. rrNAKCij. In my first annual mossage I promised to employ my bestsxertlors, in co-operation with Congress, to reduce the expenditure of the Government within the limits of a wise and judiciout economy. An overflowing treasury had produced habits of prodigality and extravagance w si.uuajiy corrected, in wort: re quired torn time ana patience. I applied myself diligent ly to tnis tasa irom tne beginning, and was aided by the able snd energetic efforts of the Heads of the different Ex ecutive Department. The result of our labors In this good cause did not appear In the sum total of our expen. ditures for the first two yean, mainly in consequence of the extraordinary expenditure necessarily incurred in the Utah expedition, and the very large amount of the contingent expenses of Congress during thit period These greatly exceeded the pay and mileage of the mem bers. For the year ending 30th June. 1858. whilst tha pay and mileage amounted to 81,490,214, the contingent expenses rose to $2,093,30970, and for the year ending 30th June. 1859, whilst the pay and mileage amounted to saav.tKMoo, tne contingent expenses amounted to 1 1.- 431,565 78. -I ant happy, however, to be able to inform you that during the last fiscal year ending on the 30th June, I860, the total expenditures of th Government In all its branches legislative, executive, snd judicial exclusive of the public sebt, were reduced to the sum or 955,402,46 40. Thit conclusively appears from the books of the Treasury. In th year ending on the 30th June, leas), the total expenditure, exclusive or the pnbuo debt, amounted to ill, 901,128 77. and thtt for the year end ing 30th June, 189, to $66,346,226 13. Whilst the books of the Treasury show an actual expenditure of $59,848,- 471 TX ror tne sear ending on tne ssas June, lattu, ineiu ding $1,040,667 71 for the contingent expenses of Con- g est, there mutt be deducted from this amount the fats of $4,396,009 2$, with the interest npon It of 150,000, appropriated by the set of 15th February. 1860, "for th purpose of supplying the deficiency in the revenues and defraying the expehse of the Peat Office Department for the year ending the thirtieth of Jane, one thousand sight hundred and fifty-nine." This sum, therefore, justly chargeable to the year 1859, must be deducted from the sum of $9,848,474 73, in order to ascertain the expend! ture for the year ending on the 30th Jane, 1860, which leaves a balance for the expenditures of that year of $55, 402,45 46. The interest on the public debt, including a reasury notes lor tne same nscai year ending on tne 30th June, 1860, amounted to $3,177,314 62. which, added to the above turn of $55,402,465 46, makes the aggregate of $58,579,780 08. It ought in justice to be observed that several of the estimates from the departments for the year ending 30th, June, 1860, were reduced by Congress below what was and still is deemed compatible with the public interest Allowing a liberal margin of $2,500,000 for the reduc tion, and for other cause, it may be safely asserted that the sum of $61,000,000; or at the most $62,000,000, is amply sufficient to administer ihe Government and to oav the interest on the public debt, unless contingent events should hereafter render extraordinary expend itu res nec essary. This result hat been attained in a considerable degree by the care exercised by the appropriate departments in entering into public contracts. I have myself never in terfered with the award of any such contract except in a single case with the Colonization Society, deeming it ad visable to cast the whole respcnsibllty In each case on the proper head of the department, with the general Instruc tion that these contracts should always be given to the lowest and best bidder. It has ever been my opinion that publie contracts are not a legitimate source of patro nage to be conferred upon persmal or political favorites; but that in air such cases a public officer Is bound to set for the Government t a prudent individual would act for himself.

It Is with a great satisfaction I communicate the fact, thst, since the date of my last Annual Message, not a single slave has been Imported Into the United State in violation of the laws prohibiting the African slave trade. This statement is founded upon a thorough examination and investigation of the subject. Indeed, the spirit which prevailed some time since among a portion of our fellow citizens in favor of this trade seem to have en tirely subsided. I also congratulate you upon the public sentiment which now exists against the crime of setting on foot military expeditions with in the limits of the United Baxters to proceed irom mence and make war upon the people of unoffending States, with whom we are at peace . In this respect a happy change hat been effected since the commencement of my Administration. It surely ought to be the prayer ot every Christian and patriot, that such expeditions may never again receive countenance in our country or dopart fr jm our shores. It would be useless repetition to do more than refer, with earnest commendation, to my former recestrmenda tion in favor of the Pacific railroad of the grant of power to the President to employ the naval force in the vicinity, for the protection of the lives and property of our fellow-citizens pissing in transit over the different Central American routes, against sudden and lawless outbreaks and depredations; and also to protect Ameri can merchant vesse's, their cress and cargoes, against iolentand unlawful seizure and eonflaaation in the ports of Mexico and the South American republics, when these may be in a disturbed and revolutionary con dition. It is my settled conviction, that without such a power we do not afford that protection to those engaged in the commerce of the country which they hre a right to demand. 

ELECTION OF MEMBERS 07 COKORESS I again recommend to Congress the passage of a law in pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution, appoint ing a day certain, previous to the 4th March, in each year of an odd number, for the election of representatives throughout all the states. A similar power has already been exercised, with general approbation, in the appoint- ment of the same day throughout the Union for holding the election of electors for President and Vice President of Ihe United States. My attention was earnestly direct ed to this subject from the fact, that the 35th Congress terminated on the 3d of March, 1858, without making the necessary appropriation for the service of the Post Office Department. I was then forced to consider the best reme dy for this omission, and an immediate call of the present Congress was me naturat resort. Upon inquiry, however. I ascertained that fifteen out of the 33 States composing the Confederacy were without representatives, and that, consequently, these fifteen States would be disfranchised by such a call. The.-e fifteen States will be in the same condition on the 4th Match next. Ten of them cannot elect representatives, according to existing State lans, un til different periods, extending from the beginning of August next until me months ot uctoher and Novem ber.

TARIFF. It is bow quite evident that the financial necessities of the Uovernment will require a midiflcation of the tariff daring yoar present session, for the purpose of increas ing the revenue. In this aspect, I desire to reiterate the recommendation contained in my last two annual mes sages, in favor of imposing specific instead of ad valorem duties on all imported articles to which these can be properly appaed. From long observation and expen ence I am convinced that specific duties are neceasary. both to protect the revenue and to secure to ourmanu facturing interests that amount of incidental enconge ment which unavoidably results from a revenue tariff. As an abstract proposition, it may be admitted' that ad valorem times would, in theory, be tbe most just and equal, but it the experience of this and all other com zaercial nations has demonstrated tfcat such duties cannot be assessed and collected without great frauds upon the revenue, then it is the part of wisdom to resort to specific duties. Indeed, from the very nature of an ad valorem daty, this mutt be the result. Under it the inevitable oensequence is, that foreign goers will be entered at less than their true value. The treasury will, therefore-, lose the difference between their real and fictitious value, and to this extent we are defrauded. The temptation which ad valorem duties present to a dishonest importer are irresistable. His object is to pass his goods through the customhouse at the very lowest valuation neceasary to save them from confiscation. In this he too often succeeds in spite of the vigilance of the revenue officers. Hence the resort to false invoices, one for the purchaser and another for the custom-house, and to other expedients to defraud the Government. The honest importer produces his invoice to the collector. stating the actual price at which he purchased tbe arti cles abroad. Not so the dishonest importer and the agent of the foreign manufacturer. And here it may he ob served that a very large proportion of the manufactures imported from abroad are consigned for sale to commis sion merchants who are mere agents employed by the manufacturers. In such cases no actual sale ha been made to fix their value. The foreign manufacturer, if he be dishonest, prepares an invoice of the goods, not at their actual value, but at the very loweat rate neceasary to escape detection . in mis manner me dishonest im porter and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decided ad vantage over me honest merchant They are thus en allied to undersell the fair trader, and drive him from the market. In fact, the operation of this system has already driven from me pursuits oi honorable c mmerce many of that class of regular and conscientious merchants. whose character throughout the world, is the pride of oar country. The remedy for these evils is to be found in specific duties, so far aa this may be practicable. They diapenae with any inquiry at the custom-house Into the actual cost or value of the article, and it pays tbe precise a mount of duty previously fixed by law. They present no temptations to the appraisers oi foreign goods, who receive but small salaries, and might, by undervaluation in a lew cases, render themselves independent Besides, specific duties best conform to the requisition in the Constitution that "no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the porta of one State over those of another." Vnderour ad valorem system such preferences are to tome extent inevitable. and complaints have often been made that the spirit of tnis provision nas teen violated by a lower appraisement of the same artioles at one port than at another. An impression strangely enough prevail to some ex tent that specific duties are necessarily protective duties. Nothing can be more fallacious. Great Britain glories in free trade, andyet her whole revenue from imports la at the present moment collected under a system of specific duties. It is a striking fact in this connection that, in the commercial treaty of 23d January, 1860, between France and England, one ofa.be article provides that the ad valorem duties which it imposes shall be converted into specific duties within six months from its date, and these are to be ascertained by making an average of the prices for six months previous to that time. The re verse of the proposition would be nearer to the truth, because a much larger amount of revenue would be col lected by merely converting the ad valorem duties "of a tarifl into equivalent specific duties. To this extent the revenue would be increased, and in the same proportion the specific daty might be diminished. Specific duties would secure to the American manufac turer the incidental protection to which he is fairly enti tled under a revenue tar iff, and to this surely no person wonld object. The framer of the existing tariff have gone further, and in a liberal spirit have discriminated in favor ef large and useful branches of our manufactures. not by raising the rate ef duty upon the importation of similar articles from abroad, but what la the same in ef fect, by admiting articles free of daty which enter into the composition of their fabric. Under the present system it hat been often truly re marked that this incidental protection decreases when the manufacturer needs it most, and increase when he needs it least, and constitutes a sliding scale which always op erates against him. The revenue of the country are sub ject to similar fluctuation. Instead of approaching a ateady standard . as would be the case under a system of specific duties, they sink and rise with the sinking and rising prices of articles in foreign countries It wouldnot be difficult for Congress to arrange a system of specific duties which would afford additional stability both to oar revenue and our manufactures, and without injury or in justice to any interest of the country. This might be ac complished by ascertaining the average value of any given article for a series of years at the place of exportation, and by simply converting the rate of ad valorem duty upon it which might be deemed necessary for revenue purposes, into the form of a specific duty. Such an arragement cooia not injure me consumer, if ne shonld pay a greater amount of duty one year, this would be counter balanced by a lesser amount the next, and in the end the aggregate would be the asms.
