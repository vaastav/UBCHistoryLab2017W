The Controller's tables of Police Department : expenditure furnish food for solemn thought. ! For lUOI the total outlay for that Department In a!! the boroughs will be more than $11,000, 000, Including the amounts to be spent for new station houses, Kites and supplies. The number ' of njen to v.-hoin salaries will be paid is 7,500, and the average Hilary will be $1,377 2L This city pays its policemen more generously than •ny other of the big cities of dm world, and treats them in every way with more indulgence than anything seen elsewhere. And yet there •re certain greedy intriguer* in the Department who intend to apply to the Legislature again to cot down the regular hours for patrolmen on j duty to eight out of the twenty-four. Any scheme of that sort wblch may be brought up at Albany should be kicked out of the State j Capitol with scant ceremony. If It were adopt. ! «-d it would Inevitably increase the appropria tions for The Department and would make still ' heavier the grievous burdens under which out ! taxpayers are now groaning. When extensive strikes occur, when possibil- : itles of mob violence are in the air. when huge ; parades or celebrations take place, the wearers ' of the uniform are sometimes kept so busy that ! their usual allowance of rest may b» curtailed. ! But see how ruddy and rugged they are! now I many guardians of the peace In this town have | been hurried to untimely graves by overwork? How many of them have become chronic in valids or have been shattered in health for any considerable time because of excessive teal in ' the performance of duty? In the height of a ! political campaign and during the crush of a ! Dewey jiror-ession, policemen may become ; weary, and may even be upset for a space. But I what an unrivalled capacity they have for mak- j ing up arrears of rest when the temporary press- j ure is withdrawn! And what a host of them there is! Al- j most eight thousand in the Department, at ! average salaries of 51J57721 each! Average ' salaries of that sort would make the average clergymen in any church body exultant over ¦ their pecuniary portion. This .tv has all the : policemen it net-in, and Ik now spending too much money on the Department. When the biggest mass meeting* and parades of the recent campaign were !a fmgmm. the police array was highly impressive. &m it should be admitted nngradgingly. that a* a rul* rt,+ mm did their work well. It is certain, bowser, that the De partment cost* the taxpayers several millions too much. An estimate hat been prc;*r*-4 by th eda cttlonal authorities that more than $14,000,000 will be wanted ere long for r *w sin-« and new buildings for schools. New-York should never be stingy to the schools, and. no matter how ¦may millions may he poured out. as many new edioola •• are really needed and can be made Ceoclnelj useful to the largest benefit of the immunity should be got ready with all prac •¦¦*• Epecfl. Bat suspicions are abroad that in . the eelection of sites and In the construc tion of buildings the municipal Interests are not always wen guarded. Is It not true that favored politicians hare succeeded In some in stances in selling- land for sites at prices far above their market value? Is It not true that con tractors now and then have amassed excessive profits out of the construction of new houses? More schools we must have soon. Let us have all that are required, but the taxpayers are anxious. They know that most of the municipal departments are wasteful and profuse. They know also that some of those departments are honeycombed with leaks, and that some of them have at their heads Commissioners who cannot be trusted. When can the taxpayers expect that their money will be prudently applied for the wisest objects? Sat under the present sys tem of local government. MR. 

ODELL AND THE CAXALB. Mr. Odell's announcement that Colonel John X Partridpre will continue in office under his administration as Superintendent of Public Works will be received with pleasure and ap proval by everybody but the spoilsmen, who regret the good old days of fat contracts and unbalanced bid*. This is the first indication Mr. Odell has given since his election of the policy he will pursue as Governor, and it is gratifying to find that confidence has not been misplaced in his promises to give a businesslike administration and in his realization of the possibilities of power and reputation which lie in the Independent exercise of the Governor's office with a single eye to the proper conduct of State affairs. It Is understood that Colonel Partridge was not a candidate for reappointment. Doubtless the Governor-elect could have superseded him with some respectable person, who would have helped the politicians once more to make the canals a source of patronage, without exciting any remark or having to give any explanation. Hi* positive move to retain the present Super intendent beopenks a positive intention to keep the canal administration up to the standard set in the last two years. From it ire may fairly argue a disposition to hold other branches of the public work up to the same standard. The canal problem is one that New- York must soon face in its large aspects and reach a decision as to the future development or practical aban donment of the State's waterways. If the pros pect of another revel In wasteful contracts faced the people It is impossible to believe that they would not veto Improvements altogether. With a man like Colonel Partridge In charge the question of enlargement has a fair chance of judgment on its own merits. Governor Roosevelt found great difficulty In placing men like Colonel Partridge In office. The pressure of the politicians for a man a little less austere than the one he had selected often called for the exercise of bis most strenu ous qualities of resistance, and the process of accommodation was frequently a long and troublesome one, not always bringing satisfac tory results. If Mr. Odell has any such friction to overcome the public has not secured evidence of it. Perhaps his intimate connection with the organization enables him to accomplish his pur poses without announcement of his struggles. Perhaps his bold on the organization is such that his wishes, even of a nature which would have been antagonized If held by Governor Roosevelt find unquestioned, if not willing, acceptance. Whatever the source of his power, we are glad to see the initial exercise of It so well directed. 

FILTRATION OF CITY WATER. That portion of the Grand Jury's presentment which deals with the question of nitration of the tUf ¦ water supply is worthy of most careful attention, and on receiving such attention will be found also worthy of cordial commend** tion and practical execution. It is Indisputably true that "other cities have already recognized the importance of filtration." The half dozen large cities named in the presentment are only a few of those in this country which have prac tically undertaken the task. Ju other countries numerous cities have for years been most sue cessfully filtering their water. Some of them, such as Hamburg, far less favorably situated than New-York, are compelled to use polluted and poisonous harbor water, but by filtration they make it as pure and clear and sparkling as that of an Alpine spring. And yet the quaint congeries of incapacity and neglect which con trols the water supply of this second city of the world smugly assures us that filtration of the water supply of a large city does not yet ap pear to be practicable, and thinks- that if we will only persevere in the use of unclean water we will in time get so accustomed to it that we will not mind, but will rather like its im purity. Just like the horse whose owner trained him to eat sawdust instead of oats, only. Just as he got so accustomed to the sawdust as to prefer it to oats, the perverse brute spoiled the whole experiment by dying! Now it is all twaddle to talk about the Croton water beinp nothing hut the drainage of barn yards and cesspools, anyway, and so unfit for use. aud it therefore l»eing necessary to aban don it and to go to Lake George or the North Woods or to the virtuous and impeccable pur lieus of Ramapo for a supply. This city has spent vast sums of money in removing whole villages from proximity to the Croton and its afHuents, so that to-day that water system is singularly free from danger of pollution. No one can inspect the courses of the Croton, Cross and Museoot without being strongly impressed by that fact. The actual amount of or danger of contamination of those streams by the prox imity of man and his works is probably less than that of the o*her sources of supply which have been mentioned. There are. however, other kinds of contamination to which practi cally all streams and lakes are subject, and those, indeed, are most subject which are' most solitary and remote from the abodes of men. There are fishes and turtles and other creatures in the water, which in time die and decompose. There are otters and musk-rats and wild fowl! which contribute their share to defilement of the water. There are fallen leaves and dc« ay ing trees and shrubs and other vegetation which greatly swell the aggregate of impurity The Croton system is more free from such -bings than the more remote streams and lakes of the mountains, yet it suffers from them and mill of necessity always do so. Thi- natural and obvious remedy Is to be found in filtration. That is a course prescribed by common cleanliness. People of decent ,-»*- MtJM do not eat food without first cleansin- it of the Impurities that may have lodged upon it They wash or pare fruits and vegetables and remove all dust and dirt from grain beforo it is ground into flour. The same principle of deanli ness requires that water fihall similarly be pui i- Cd by filtration, especially the water of rlv^-s and lakes, which is peculiarly exposed t o pollu tion The entire practir-ability of doing it has long been well established. The only ohstn.-l< in the way is the obstinacy, the stupidity or the dishonesty of officialdom. With a proper filtra tion system New York would have a supply o f water more pure than that which Glasgow gets from Loch Katrine or Munich from the slop, ¦ of the Alps. With a system of mains H nd Plumbing that would prevent leakage, and of meters that would deter wa«te, the present sup ply would be ample not only for tho nriwwt city, but for the future dty that shall be double the sixe of this. The one great question in the 

XEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. MONDAY. DECEMBER^ 1900, case is that which is asked by the Grand Jury: "Shall New-York be behind other cities in ade quate care for the health of its citizens?" If It is not to be behind them It must save Its water supply from waste and redeem it from pollution. MONEY AND BUSINESS. Conservatism prevails, showing that the American people have learned a lesson and are profiting by recent disastrous experiences. The present situation, both as to dealings In com modities and operations In securities, reflects the stable conditions that follow wise leader ship. Instead of forcing prices far above a rea sonable level, now that all uncertainties are re moved, the markets move slowly but steadily ferward. while actual consumptive demand im proves in a wholesome manner that promises permanent prosperity. The country is in a much stronger position than at any previous time in its history, and no small factor cf strength is the disinclination to inflate prices, while moderation In the matter of production Is also encouraging. Manufacturers are not ac cumulating excessive supplies, and dealers do not make contracts for more goods than they can sell. Stocks are not being heaped on the shelves or stored in warehouses. Yet labor is well employed, and the demand for transporting facilities often exceeds the available supply of freight cars. New foreign markets are success fully entered by enterprising exporters. Com petition is keen, which helps to prevent sharp advances in prices, but even where goods are controlled by a few strong hands there is no tendency to demand extortionate figures, for abundant capital is ready to enter any branch o! business that offers a good profit. Discrimination is shown to a marked degree by investors In securities. Solid railway shares are taken freely, and. while there Is no longer rampant speculation, prlce% move toward a higher level. The sixty most active railroads averaged $70 16 on Saturday, the top point for eighteen years, and 28 cents above the highest record of the recent movement, made on No vember 22. Meanwhile the Industrials have de clined about $3 a share, and gas and traction stocks lost about $2. This tendency to confine operations to properties of known value Is the best feature of the market, and minimizes the chances of a severe collapse. Railroad earn ings In the third week of November showed a better gain than In the first half of the month, raising the total to 1 per cent over last year's figures, despite a loss of 13 per cent In the grangers. Full returns for October Indicate a heavy decrease In the earnings of coal roads, owing to the strike, but activity has been re sumed In recent weeks, and at some mines lack of cars seems to be the only restricting in fluence, notwithstanding the remarkably mild season. Temperature had noticeable Influence on the textile industry in all its branches, especially In respect to drygoods trading, of which failures during November amounted to $2,308,375. This amount exceeded liabilities in any sin gle month of the last four years, but was smaller than four months of 1896, when business was generally depressed. Sales of wool at tbe Eastern markets increased to 5,836.300 pounds, against 5,354,331 pounds in the preceding week, and manufacturers were showing more Interest at Boston, although Phila delphia dealers named somewhat easier quota tions on cheaper grades without securing much business. Cotton goods were taken more freely than at any recent period, and bleached goods advanced about one-quarter of a cent. For the first time in months the weekly statement of ex ports from this city included a good movement of cottons, and even brown sheetings were held more firmly. The hi^h price of raw cotton makes it difficult for mills to undertake future deliv eries, and most recent spinning was of cotton purchased before the advance. Disparity be tween quotations of finished goods and raw ma terial makes the situation unsatisfactory, but consumers are loath to buy at even moderate gains over previous quotations. Roughly speak ing, the raw material is 20 per cent above the price of January 1, while cotton goods have not averaged a grain of 1 per cent. Footwear exhibited the most general advance during the week, although the alteration was slight. After two months and a half of un changed quotations there was an advance all along the line, and manufacturers had no diffi culty In securing purchasers. In fact, the orders placed were so large that shops are assured of activity for some months, and there was some reluctance about accepting business for distant delivery where stocks of raw material were lim ited. Jobbers appeared confident that there would come a demand for heavy boots and rhoes ; notwithstanding mild weather, and orders were received from all sections. Shipments from Boston were 85,233 cases, against 75,773 in the preceding week. Leather has remained steady, and for the first time in months there appeared a general decline in the Chicago hide market. Iron and steel markets are quiet at Pittsburg. mills having good orders as a rule, while at Western and Southern points the demand for pig is vigorous and new furnaces are blown in. Stocks do not accumulate, however, for rolling mill 3 and makers of finished forms have need of much raw material. Railroads are urgent for cars and supplies of all kinds, and structural shapes are ordered freely. Prices are firm at recent advances, without any further gain for the week. Coke follows the movement of Iron, both production and shipments increasing. Bank exchanges continue heavy, indicating the general activity of business at all points. The fourteen principal cities reported an in crease of 252 per cent ovor the corresponding five days of 1800, while there was a gain of 18 per cent over the full week in 1898. which was the banner year up to that time. Minneapolis alone reported a loss of over 10 per cent com pared with last year, while a small decrease of 1.3 per cent occurred at San Francisco. A small loss appeared In the surplus of the associated banks, but there is still an excess of $2,328,950 over last year's figures. The decrease was due to a heavy gain In the loan item, probably caused by borrowings in connection with sales of securities by London. Money markets are easy and specie holdings increase by receipts from the interior and the Pacific Coast. Another large consignment of gold reached San Francisco from Australia, making $15,643,000 since the movement began. Tnere is no difficulty in se curing \odns on good securities of all kinds, and the proportion of commercial paper held by the banks showfe an increase. Imports of mer chandise foruhe week w»re large, exceeding last year's figure} by ever 50 per cent, while exports were etill larger, but compared with a better movement a year ago For the month the bal ance of trade was slightly against this country at this port, but as about two-thirds of the total Imports are received here and only about one third of the exports go out from New- York, there is assured a good increase <n foreign In debtedness, although probably much less than the record breaking figures of October. The City Fathers seem to have no friends Whatever any critic has to say about other proposed charter changes, he Is disposed to Join In giving them a kick. President York talks about the police again as If they were an abused body of men. a few days ago he frankly admitted that vice was largely protected, and that it paid for protec tion. It eeems hard for him to keep his back bone up to the standard of his flashes of virtuous aspiration. One of Richard Croker*s bulldogs has taken a Prise in Philadelphia. The Sage of Wantage may derive a bit of consolation from that news when it reaches him In his sylvan retreat on the other side of the sea. But his rejoicing will be clouded by the thought that while a Croker bull dog may snatch a blue ribbon, the Tammany tiger will soon be thrust outside the gate. He Is not even highly commended. Whenever a bank clerk is round to have stolen a lot of money, it is pretty safe to look to the dives of the Tenderloin to see what has brccme of it. The Harlem Hospital is much too small for the requirements of the territory which It tries to serve, and the delay in opening the new Gouverneur Hospital is causing trouble and dis tress. New-York's quality of mercy should com pel prompt action for the relief of both the up town and downtown districts.

PROTESTS AGAINST THE REMOVAL OF THE INSTRUMENTS. Tien-Tsin, Dec. 2. — Protests and requests have been forwarded to Field Marshal Count yon Waldersee by the representatives of the Powers urging the prevention of the removal of as tronomical Instruments from the observatory »i Peking. Most of the principal instruments have been prepared for shipment, and labelled for Berlin or for Paris. The Chinese themselves do not protest, because, as members of LI Hung Chang's staff put it. their objections would be useless, as whatever they say or do in the way of protest only elicits uncivil treatment. The observatory is universally recognized as one of the most interesting sights in Peking. Most of the instruments now out of place are over 150 years old. Many of them are magni ficent bronzes, and. although not ct modern type, can still be used for the purposes of as tronomical observation. The number of Chinese returning baa been considerably augmented during the last few days. Apparently they are friendly. The provost marshals of the various nations are being daily informed as to the movements of returning Boxers, but only those are arrested against whom there is conclusive evidence of having killed native Christians. The first locomotive to make the trip since the siege of the legations ran yesterday from Tien- Tsin to Peking. The line will not be opened, however, for general use until about Decem ber 15. London, Dec. 3.— Dr. Morrison, telegraphing to "The Times" from Peking, says: In pursuance of their regrettable policy of ap propriation, the French and German generals, with Count yon Waldersee's approval, have re moved from the wall of Peking the superb as tronomical instruments erected two centuries ago by the Jesuit Fathers. Half of them will go to Berlin and the rest to Paris. The explanation of this act of vandalism Is that, inasmuch as the return of the Court Is so Improbable, such beautiful instruments should not be exposed to the possibilities of injury when Peking is no longer the capital. "Count yen Waldersee expresses some solici tude," says the Peking correspondent of "The Morning Post," "concerning expeditions Into the surrounding country, but he believes that they are necessary and salutary. Most of the British officers approve them. "Sir Robert Hart, in the course ef conversa tion, said he considered the resentment against foreigners to be partly Just and the outgrowth of the la3t sixty years of treaty relations. He seemed to think the settlement would be a diffi cult problem. "Chinese militia forces are being formed everywhere, and even if the Importation of for eign arms is prohibited a supply will be easily obtainable from Chinese arsenals. A body of one hundred American cavalrymen is escorting some Chinese officials to Tien-Tsin." "Chang Chin Tung has received a dispatch from Si Ngan Fu," says the Shanghai cor respondent of "The Standard." "directing him to stop the forwarding of further supplies to the Province of Shen-Sl. It Is rumored that Em peror Kwari Su will return to Peking Im mediately-, and that the Empress Dowager will follow if the reception given him is satisfac tory." The Shanghai correspondent of "The Times" also reports that it is believed, in well informed circles that the Chinese Court is anxious to re turn to Peking, but he says that such a course would not be agreeable to LI Hung Chang, who hopes to gain an advantage from dissensions among the Powers.

Though the nrst week's receipts fell far below expectations, the suc cess of the other two weeks was so great that the total receipts reached $150,000, which encourages Mr. Grau to bring out a company to San Francisco next year. With the performances that he will give on the way East, he will arrive in New-York about even. He admits he miscalculated expenses and that he brought too many people. Next year he will bring Calve and any new singers that he se cures.

VIEWS FOR AND AGAINST THE PRO. POSED CHANGES. The several changes in the city charter which have been suggested by the Charter Revision Commission provoked a great deal of discussion yesterday. Of course, opinions differed widely as to the value of the proposed alteration*, but on the whole they seem to have met more favor than disapprobation. The attack upon the un necessarily heavy salary lUt of municipal cm i ployes, the single-headed Police Commission th« Mayor's power to remove his appointees throughout his term, increased home rule for the boroughs, and the supplanting of the dual Mu | nicipal Assembly by an enlarged Board of Al dermen, were the suggestions which received most attention. Here are some of the comments that have been made upon the Charter Coir.- \ missioners' report: WILLIAM C. DE WITT, one of the framers of the original charter— l have been so Intimately connected with the construction of the charter from the beginning that I cannot speak of it frag. mentartly with any satisfaction to myself. I .-nay. hereafter, give my views upon It, which would re quire a very long publication, in fact. won:.: talcs a page of The Tribune, but for the present 1 must leave the subject with the committee. ASH BEL P. 

FITCH, also one of the framera of the original charter— l have always favored a single beaded Police Commission. JOHN J. SCANNEL.L. Fire Commissioner— l ant, in favor of single headed commissions. I would recommend one for the Fire Department, as well as the Police Department. I also approve the plan of giving the Mayor the power of removal during his entire term. ANDREW H. GREEN, one of the framers of ta« original charter)— The Mayor's term of oOce might better have been reduced to two years, wUh elSgt. blllty to re-election. RANDOLPH GUGGENHEIMER, president of the Municipal Council— Some of the changes recom mended are good and some are Impracticable. That is all I wish to say at present. 

JOHN DE WITT WARNER— like the suggestion for a local legislature consisting of one house, in- . stead of two; also those for Increasing the power of the Mayor and of each borough President, for a single headed Police Commission, for putting a check upon city salaries, for the repeal of Ramapo privileges; but I regret that the Commission dltl not recommend a wider extension of the principle of municipal ownership. 

FREDERICK BOWLET. President of the Bor. ough of Queens— The adoption of the suggestion relating to Increased powers for borough presi dents would be a vast improvement over present conditions. SMITH ELY. former Mayor of New- York— I think it would be wiser to give our new charter another year's test before adopting any of these sugges tions for revision. 

EDWARD M. GROUT. President of the Borough of Brooklyn— l heartily approve the single cham bered local legislature, the single headed police Commission and the Increase of the Mayer's power of removal to cover the entire duration of his term. The Rev. Dr. RAINSFORD. rector of St. George's Protestant Episcopal Church— There should be only one head to the Police Department. 

FRANK MOSS, counsel to the Mazet Committee— The report is an admirable one. on the whole, bat the Mayor's term of office should be reduced to two years. » CONSTANT A. ANDREWS, banker— The re modelling of the local municipal legislature and the placing of the police under the control of a single Commissioner seem to be warranted by our «x perience. THEODORE W. MYERS, former Controller of the city— lf all these changes are adopted I think that before long we will need a rerevision of the charter, but I approve the suggestion for a single head for the Police Department, increased power of removal for the Mayor and the reorganization of the Board of Education. HENRY D. PURROY. former County Clerk of New- York— The change to a single headed. Police Commission, the separation of the Board el Elec tions from the Police Department and the lopping off of superfluous departments and official* are $ much to be desired. WILLIAM BRENNAN, Deputy Commissioner ot Sewers— The charter revisers. I see. have recom mended Che abolition of the Department of Sewers, but there is certainly enough work in this depart ment to entitle it to a place by ltselt In the city government. CLARK BELL— The recommendation to Increase the Mayor's power of removal is a good one. So are the recommendations concerning the. reorganiz ation of the municipal legislature, enlarging the authority of the borough presidents and reforming the Board of Education; but I regret that the Com mission did not submit an entirely new charter for the Legislature to adopt. 

JOSEPH J. LITTLE, ex-president of the Board of Education— The Eoard of Education Is large enough now. • It should rather be decreased than Increased, as the charter revisers suggest. The borough boards should be abolished and full power to manage the schools be given to the central beard. Under the new scheme now proposed each Commissioner will be four.d to be practically su preme in his own district and will model tha schools of that district on his own ideas of what schools ought to be. T. R. FARRELL. Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Highways— l cannot agree with the suggestion that this Department should be abol ished It would virtually be a return to the old Department of City Works, which had outlived its usefulness. HENRY CLEWS, banker— One man power In taa Police Department will be an improvement, 1 feel sure. A. AUGUSTUS HEAL The concentration of re sponsibility will be a practical Improvement, espe cially in ti*e Police Department. JOHN GUILFOYLE. Commissioner of the De partment of Buildings for Brooklyn— suggestion is made that this Department be abolished and its duties divided among borough bureaus. Ido not like that. This Department should be let alone. LOUIS F. HAFFEN. President of the Borough of The Bronx— l am In favor of all ihos» sugges tions in the report which give Increased home rule to the separate boroughs. THOMAS F. BRENNAN, Deputy Commissioner of Charities -A siirgle Commissioner would. I be lieve, find It impossible to perform ail the work of this Department. I think this Department would be better let alone by the charter revisers. It »'»» never more honestly or efficiently conducted .*»» at present. THE 

ITALIAN BUDGET. OWING LARGELY TO THE CHINA EXPEDITION, IT SHOWS A DEFICIT. Rome. Dec. 2.— ln the Chamber of Deputies to day Signer Rubinl. Minister of the Treasury, an nounced that the budget of 1900-01 at present showed a deficit of 19.000.000 lire, of which 13.000.000 lire must be charged up to the expenses of the China expedition. The Minister said, however, that in view of the continuing increase of the reve nue over the estimates this deficit would certainly be greatly reduced before the end of the financial year. He pointed out. also, that while the esti mates for 1901-'O2 showed a deficit of 15.000.000 lire. here again no allowance had been made for In creasing revenues, which would probably reduce the deficit Signer Rubir.l explained that these small deficits arose from the paying off of the debt and from out lay for railroad construction. The budget situation he characterized as essentially good, but he in sisted that It was "absolutely Imperative to ab stain from all Increase of taxation and fresh loans in order to secure a budget which, by raising credit and confidence in the country, will enable the Gov ernment to proceed with much desired, extensive and useful reforms."
