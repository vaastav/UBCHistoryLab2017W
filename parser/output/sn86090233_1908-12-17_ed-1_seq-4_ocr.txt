CAPTURES VENEZUELAN SHIP The Dutch Cruiser's Act of Reprisal. * „„„ .. u nn biTUAfföfl LONG BEEN STRAINED -* Incidents That Have Caused the Rup ing the Venezulan coast guard ship Alix, with the Dutch flag flying and a Dutch crew on board. The Gelder land captured the Alix off Puerto Ca bello. At that time the Alix was lying close in shore, and notwith standing the threat which the Vene zuelan government .had made to fire upon any of the Dutch warships com mitting a hostile act, the vjelderland steamed at fun speed towards the A guardship and sent an officer and guard in a launch to seize her. No shots came from the forts on land. The seizure of the Alix was in ac cordance with the "plans of the Hol land government when instructions were issued to the three Dutch war ships now in these waters to make a demonstration off the coast of Ven ezuela and to capture any Venezue lan ships of war or guard vessels that they might find. A decree, issued by Acting Presi dent Gomez, places the republic in a state of defense. A crowd of citizens including a larger number of stu dents, went to the onicer or El Constitutional, the organ of Presi dent Castro, and indulged in a coun ter' demonstration. The feelings of this crowd were plainly hostile to Castro and to the steps taken by x uomez. The situation between Venezuela and the Netherlands has been strain ed for some months. The trouble arose indirectly in the expulsion from Caracas of M. De Reus, the diplomat ic representative of Holland, but it by the course of Venzuela in issuing a decree on May 14, last, which prac tically killed the commerce of Cu racao. President Castro refused to withdraw this decree, notwithstand ing the fact that Hollan.1 issued an ultimatum that she would take re taliatory methods unless he took prompt cognizance of her demands. Castro suggested that Holland send a representative to Caracas to confer with him on .this subject, but this the Netherlands government declined to do. Without waiting, however, to ascertain whether or not this sugges tion would be adopted, Castro sailed for Europe. Other incidents that have added to the ill feeling have been the stop page of Dutch sailing vessels at sea by the authorities of Venezuela and the storming of the Venezulan con sulate at Willemstad by a mob. Venezuela has made preparations , to resist any act of hostility. The forts at La Guayra, Puerto Cabollo and Maracaibo have been reniforced with men and munitions, but until Saturday no untoward act occurred which would give Venezuela an op portunity to answer force with lOrce. More than a week ago the three war ships, the Jacob Van Heemskerk, the Friesland and the Gelderland, steam ed along the Venezuelan coast from Puerto Cabello to La Guayra, at a distance of three thousand yards from the shore. Later the two crui sers went to Maracaibo, where they made a similar démonstration. It is understood that tne de Ruijten, a battleship, is now on its way to Wil lemstad, where it will join the others in continuing the demonstrations against Venezuela. The naval force of Venezuela con sists of ten vessels. Of these three the Bolivar, I -ida and V* rgarita, are gunboats. The others, wit.'i the , exception of the Restau rador are hardly worthy of mention. They are nothing mere than armed tugs'. There .s one 12-pound gun on the Restaurador, but outside of this, there is not a gun in the fleet bigger than a six-pounder. The Venezuelan forts, howover, mount some more * six-inch Krupp guns. lured Relations.

TAFTPLANSTSIPTOPANAMA TO STIMULATE A GREAT FROJECT l . , President Roosevelt and Secretary H1 ot AnnrovP pi„ n An itiot Appiove I l-.n lias An other Conference at White House. Contemplates a Visit Before Inauguration. Washington.—Wm. H. iaft, pres ident-elect contemplates a visit to Panama before lixs inauguration. This visit is approved by President Roosevelt and Secretary Root. While it has not been finally determined upon Mr. Taft announced -uat it was his intention to go. Should this be his final decision, he will leave the port of Charleston, S. Ç., prob ably the last week in January for a trip which will cover approximately twenty days. There are many reasons, in Mr. Taft's view, why the trip of the president-elect to the isthmus would be of decided advantage to the ad vancement of the project and con sequently to the United States. President Roosevelt's visit proved a decided stimulus to the work; the three visits which Mr. Taft made as secretary of war were a.l of advant age; there are constantly arising and accumulating many minor tan gles of administration and conflict of authority, which the presence of the president or the president-elect might make possible of eliminating with little difficulty. Mr. Taft feels that this is practi cally "his only opportunity to visit the isthmus during his forthcoming term as president. The journey, if made, would un doubtedly be'on one of the navy's best ships. The only objection to the expedi tion which has been pointed out \)y careful students of the laws and con stitution is that, pending the official declaration of Mr. Taft as president elect by the action of the electoral ollege and his inauguration as pres idsnt there is no constitutional or legal provision for the substitution of any one else in case anything hap pens to him in Panama. This objec tion is not regarded as of sufficient weight to detain Mr. Tatt from a journey which is regarded as essen tial to the success of one oL the big enterprises of .his administration. The news of this trip followed a conference with President Roosevelt and again at the the white house at luncheon and later with Secretary Root. Further details of the Roose velt-Root conference were not made known beyond the statement by Mr. Taft that the selection of his cabinet was thoroughly discussed. BY

MORE VICTIMS DIE. . j Aftermath of Battle Between Po lice and Fanatics. Kansas City, Mo.—Two more names were added to the list of dead as a result of the battle here be tween religious fanatics and the po lice, the total number now being four. Louis Pratt, the foremost disciple of James Sharp, died and an hour later Michael Mullane, a policeman, succumbed to his wounds. Mullane suffered himself to be mortally wounded because he would not shoot a woman. According to witnesses he dodged behind a wagon when Mrs. Sharp attacked him with a revolver, and though she continued firing, he made no resistance. It developed that both Pratt and James Sharp, who is still at large, assumed the ti tie of "Adam God" when preaching in separate localities, but Sharp, as founder of the sect, held the prior claim to the title. Pratt pppfessed to have the same divine fire, but in a lesser degree. : --- j DUTCH SEIZE MERCHANT SHIPS Two War Vessels, Cleared for Action, Sent to Stop Venezuelan Trade.

The plan is to prepare a bill on such evidence as they have and will have in the course of the hearing, and then to call for additional evidence as to the items whenever it should seem necessary, Not only from conversations with the members together, but with the mem- bers separately, I am convipced that they are in good faith, going to pre- pare a bill which is going to be a thorough revision on the basis of the platform of the Republican party.
