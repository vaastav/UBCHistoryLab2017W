Nothing pats a bigger leather la the cap of a society btfetess/says the London Saturday Journil, or atthei satne time causes her more anxioui cares and thought rather than mere expenditure than the presence at one of her dinners or dances in the huge Mayfair mansion of a member of tbe royal family—most of all tbe king and queen. The entertaining of royalty is one of tbe most delicate triumphs the society woman, whether she be a duchess or merely a millionairess, can achieve. It has a code of etiquette all to itself—a code which must be rigidly observed or no .hope is tfeere of ever securing anotber visit from a royal guest of tbe reigning house. The number of titled and untitled guests bidden to meet the sovereign at, say, a dinner party is strictly limited and of course highly select, On one oc casion .$20,000 was spent by a hostess in entertaining a crowned head for a week end, while another example is that of a certain baronet who bad a marble staircase put In bis house sole ly because of an approaching visit from the late king. A Remarkable Escape. During the reign of terror in Paris one of the most remarkable escapes was that of M. de Cbateaubrun. He was sent to execution with twenty other prisoners, but after the fifteenth head had fallen tbe guillotine got out of order and a workman was sent for to repair it. The six remaining vic tims were left standing in front of the machines with their hands tied behind them. A French crowd is very cu rious, nnd the people kept pressing forward to see tbe man arranging the guillotine. By degrees M. tie Cbateau brun, who was to the rear of his com panions, found himself in the front line of the spectators, then in the sec ond and finally well behind those who had come to see his bead cut off. Be fore the men could get tbe guillotine in working order night began to fall, and M. de Cbateaubrun slipped away. When in the Champs Elysees he told a man that a wag bad tied his hands and robbed him of -his hat, and this simple individual set him free. A few days later M. de Cbateaubrun escaped from France. Due Precautions. In a town In Georgia there was an old preacher whose knowledge of the world was not wide nor deep, but who conceived it to be a place where, if one should trust bis fellow men, he should at the same time keep an eye on bis own interests. One hot day be pulled off bis coat and preached a vigorous sermon under tbe pines in bis sbirt sleeves. At the close of the open air service one of his admirers approached bim and said regretfully: "I don't suppose you knew, that tbe editor of one of the big New York Sunday papers was here when you pullcl off your coat." "I reckon I knew it well for I'd been told of it," said the preacher calmly. "I don't believe he's as bad as be might be. and anyway I put my coat on tbe ch:tlr close by and bad it rigbt under my eye all the time."—Youth's Companion. Moro Story of tho Flood. The legend of the flood as told by the Moras is as follows: •When the forty days and nights of rain came No and his family got into a box. One pair of each sort of bird and beast also came in. Men who were busy with their ordinary occupa tions and did not enter the box were overtaken by tbe flood. Those who ran to the mountains became mon keys those who ran to tbe water, fish. The Chinaman changed to a hornbill. A woman who was eating the fruit of a seaweed nnd would not stop was changed into a fish called a dugong, and her limbs can still be seen under its skin."

The international aviation meet at Belmont park closed with the record breaking feat of Jobnstone, who as cended more than one and three fourth miles. He wanted to make It an even 10,000 feet, for he believed that no aviator In tbe world would beat that for a long time to come. Men in balloons have ascended as blgh as five to seven miles and come back to tell of it, so tbe aviators have noth ing new in human experience at high altitudes. As a test of tbe power of tbe ma chine these''high ascents have value. High ascents are necessary at times in order to work an aeroplane above dangerous air currents. But tbe feats of control accomplished at Belmont park show true progress. For a man to drive his craft over tbe air currents of a great city, circle the statue of Liberty and return to tbe starting point nearly twenty miles away was remarkable, and for three men to do the very same thing within tbe space of an hour and with less than eight minutes' difference in time for tbe round trip was still more remarkable. This is the aviator's true goal—to nav igate tbe air at will. He does that well when the wind favors him. When he can laugh at the wind the conquest of the air will have arrived.

LITTLE HOPE OF ENACTMENT Measures Recommended to Congress by the President. Washington, Dec. 7.—Congress gave respectful attention to President Taft's message, but there were comparative ly few members who were willing to concede the probability of favorable action at the present session on many of the recommendations, contained therein. The general opinion was that time would not permit of action in view of the fact that the session will close March 4. Prior to the cabinet meeting Presi dent Taft devoted an hour to seeing, congressional callers. Probably, his most interesting vis itor was Representative-elect Caleb Powers of Kentucky, who was con victed three times of complicity in the. Goebel murder case. Mr. Powers was introduced to the president by Senator Bradley, who declared that the new member of congress had been vindicated by the heaviest vote ever, given a congressman in his district. President Taft will devote most of the remainder of this week to con ferences with senators, representa tives and men of prominence regard ing the judicial appointments which he is expected to send to the senate next week.
