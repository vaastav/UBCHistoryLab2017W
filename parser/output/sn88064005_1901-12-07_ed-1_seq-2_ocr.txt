Congressman Moody, of Massa chusetts,bhas introduced a resolution in Congress calling for an examina tion into the abridgment of the right of j suffrage in this State. Of course thereZisyconsiderable speculation to the final outcome of the matter. Inasmuch.as it appears tobe an in dividual rather than a party move, we do not attach much importance to it. Congress has its full share of cranks and fools as Mark Hanna says, and we opine Moody is one of the freaks. Be this as it may, the day is not far distant when the peculiar suffrage laws of Louisiana, Mississippi,South and NorthCarolina will be subjected to Congressional action and we believe when that time'comes the:opinion of Senators Caffery and McFnery will be affirmed, that section five is un constitutional As between the two evils, uareduction of our present rep resentation ainCongress or the her, rors of universal and unretricted negro snffrageeweifeel p 'hesitancy in saying that the good people] of Louisiana would"gladly 'part with five itxths;of their Congressmen rather than return to theoldjorderj of thmigs. We may as well be candid among ourselves and admit thatjthe famous Section 6]whichlso effectually elimi nates the negro as Can e'ector is a barefacedjfratid, purposely designed to circumvent another partisan fraud the 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution. If the departedispirits of Thad Stevens andOliver P: Morton can return abd sway the feelings of the Republicans now;in Congress we wil be punished for thus undoing their efforts to, set black.heels on white necks. 

TBYING AN OLD DODGE. The Sugar Trust evidently has started a literary bureau and its screeds remind us very forcibly of the old lottery gang.

I his THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. President Roosevelt has sent his first message to Congress. It is an able paper and contains much that we can heartily commend, especially is this so with regard to upholding the Monroe doctrine, restricting for eign immigration and aid in develop ing the and districts of the West. When it comes to the discussion of our relations with Cuba he takes a stand which means the destruction of our sugar interests. He says: "Elsewhere I have discussed the question of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of national interest why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly ask your atten tion to the wisdom, indeed, to the vital need, of providing for a sub stantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban imports into the United States. Cuba has in her Constitu tion affirmed what we desired, that she should stand, in international matters, in closer and more friendly relations with us than with any other power; and we are bound by every consideration of honor and expedi ency to pass commercial measures to the interest of her material well being."

The mat which is now almost ready to be sunk is eight hundred feet long and two hundred feet wide. Five large barges of rocks arrived Tues day. The mat is made of willows of about two inches in diameter which are packed and bound in bundles of about twenty, and which bundles are subsequently firmly fastened together by an interlacing cable. The rocks are distributed as equally as possible upon the thus composed mat just be fore it is sunk. A Woman's Awfthl Peril.

It is an old saying, "You can't keep a good man down," and we see it well exemplified in the case of our friend H. P. Lane of that splendid paper, the Ruston Leader. A short time ago he undertook to publish a live daily in that slow town. It was a paper that would do credit to, a place twice the size of Ruston, but he got no advertising patronage. Realizing that he was publishing a nonpareil paper m a great primer town, he quit-but not for long. He has come back with a . little three column folio, -'Lane's Daily Light-, full of life and news, and still a lit tle heavier f calibre thtan the town. Saw Deatlh iear.
