) THE TOPEKA DAILY STATE JOURNAL TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 5, 1916 3 II. C. L. TAKES LEADING ROLE AT WASHINGTON Embargo Against Foreign Ship ments Can't Win. President Reads Message Today Before Congress. SPECIAL MESSAGE LATER To Peal With Plans to Meet National Food Crisis. Eleven Kills Introduced May lie Condensed to One. Washington. D. C, Dec. 5. Con press today awaits only President Wil son's personal recommendations for legislative action on matters he deems pressing, before plunging into the work of solving the high food ques tion. The president appears before a Joint session at 1 o'clock this afternoon to read his annual message. While he will today urge the rail road legislation to supplement the Adamson act as one of the most im mediate problems to be considered at this session, he is said to believe the hiph cost of living and what steps the federal government can take to con trol the situation has entirely over shadowed even the railroad issue. No Recommendations Yet. While the president has assured many of the hundreds protesting asainst the annual food prices tnat tne government would certainly take steps to meet the situation, it seemed un Jikely he would recommend a course of procedure in his message today. The president is receiving regular reports from the different depart ments investigating food prices and problems. He is understood to have determined that the departments of commerce, agriculture and justice should be given an opportunity to look into the. situation sufficiently to determine what action would be most advisable by congress. This has led to the belief held by many, that the president will communicate later a recommendation in a special message. Klcven Bills Introduced. Chairman Henry of the house rules committee, will confer with the presi dent tomorrow evening to devise the befit plan of expediting congressional solution of the food price problem, Henry spent considerable time today with Judge A damson, of the house Interstate and foreign commerce com mittee, going over the eleven bills al ready presented and aimed at halting soaring prices by food embargoes, con trol of cold storage sales, reduction of parcel post rates, etc. An effort ia expected to be made at once to co ordinate all these measures into one that will hnve complete support of the president and be backed by the findings of the various departments investigating the problem. While laws designed as food price panaceas are expected to be proposed in great number, it now seems doubt ful any will pass. Attempts to bring about a food em bargo are certain to get no further than a lot of talk. The administration will never get behind such measures and leaders say the administration holds power to carry out its ideas on this line.

Experts here were inclined to doubt that the Germans had yet brought up heavy artillery of sufficient ranee to shell Bucharest from their positions less than a dozen miles to the south. It was still noted here with satisfac tion that even the German official statements with their claims of sweep ing victory, do not carry news of cap ture of any considerable portion of the Rumanian army. The number of pris oners has been large, of course, but not so big as to suggest anything more than an orderly retreat by the Ruman ians. Count 6(10 Dead on Field. Sofia. Dec. 5. Sanguinary repulse of attacks in Dobrudja and capture of Satisseui was asserted in today's of ficial Bulgarian statement. "After complete defeat of attacks against our left wing between Satis keui and the Danube," the statement asserted, "the enemy retreated to its former positions and we occupied Sat iskeui. The enemy's losses were ex tremely heavy. On Hill 234 we counted six hundred dead and cap tured four machine guns. "Two enemy warships shelled Con stanza but without success or dam age." Concerning the fighting in Ru mania, the statement said: "In Wallachia the enemy's attack on our right front was repulsed. Along the Danube there was artillery firing." Serbs Driving Northward.

"We have shown It was the outcry of a cat or the scream of a woman swinging." Strop declared. "Either would account for the noises heard by state's witnesses." Judge Thomas F. Ryan, the trial judge, overruled his former motion that a night session would be held so that the case could be given to the jury at once and court was ordered to convene this morning at 9 o'clock. Judge Strop was making a lengthy analysis of the testimony presented by both sides. This, he said last night, would be continued today. At what length, he declared he did not know. Mr. Barker said he expected to speak probably an hour. His argument will be for the state, in addition to that made by Bart M. Lockwoo'd, special prosecutor, yesterday morning. L. C. Gabbert spoke prior to Judge Strop for the defense. Judge Strop resumed his argument in behalf McDaniel shortly after 9 o'clock continuing his analysis of the testimony. He declared that "scandal mongers," and "people who assassi nate character," had started the prose cution against McDaniel. "They started out to prove McDaniel tried to prevent an inquest but they failed." Strop said. "When they en deavored to prove evidence was burned and likewise they failed in that." The court room setting was the same today that it was yesterday. The accused man was accompanied into court by his three children and numer ous relatives. Judge Strop said a robbery motive for the crime was sup plied by the testimony of a state's witness that two of Mrs. McDaniel's rings were missing. Talked to Jury 5 Honrs. The attitude of M Sarah Moss and Miss Aileene Moss, mother and sister of the slain woman, against the accused man was caused by "lies" which had been told them. Judge Strop said. In speaking of the testi-t-ony of Miss Moss, who was a state's witness, he said she bailed to tell of any disagreement between McDaniel and his wife. "The Moss family came to live at McDaniel's home, to take care of the children," Strop declared. "If they had thought him guilty, would they have desired to live with the slayer of Mrs. McDaniel?" Judge Strop closed with an appeal to the jury to favor McDaniel because he now "must be the father and mother of these three little children." Judge Strop's entire argument con sumed five hours and fifteen minutes, Attorney General Barker will speak this afternoon. JUMPS COOPER AGAIN Man of Matrimonial Woes Can Tear Down His House. Xot J. H. Cooper, the man of many matrimonial troubles, was restrained by the district court today from tear ing down the old stone house at- the corner of Ninth and Quincy streets.

A vear or more ago Mrs. Cooper was granted separate maintenance and judgment was rendered in her favor against Cooper for a large amount of money. The property at Ninth and Quincy was mentioned in the judgment and there is a lien upon it in Mrs. Cooper's judgment. Not withstanding the lien, she told the court.

Lawyer Insists Lottie Sirens Dreamed She Was Attacked. The fate of Archie Porter is in the hands of the jury. The attorneys for the state and for the defense conclud ed their arguments just before noon and the jury retired after listening to Judge A. W. Dana's instructions. It is up to the twelve men to deter mine whether Lottie Bivens, 14-year-old white girl, was dreaming when she charged that Porter crawled thru a window and into her bed last Octo ber or whether she really had that experience. In his closing argument Elisha Scott, negro attorney for Porter, bore down hard upon the dream theory. He launched into an oratorical effort that lasted for forty mintes. He declared the state knew it had no case, other wise W. E. Atchison would have been handling the prosecution. Up to Rad Lee. "Whenever a case comes into the county attorney's office without real merit," said Scott, "Mr. Atchison backs out of it and Rad Lee handles it just as he is in this instance." Then he proceeded to cite several such alleged instances. Mr. Atchison was in the room and objected to that statement. "I object,"said Scott, "to Mr. Atch ison saying anything now. He is not in this case. He had his chance to talk when the case was tried but he didn't sit in it a minute and now that we are completing it I object to giving him any time." Judge Dana ruled that Mr. Atchison should have a chance to make an ex planation. "All right," said Scott, "but if he does I want the stenographer to take down my objection, my serious objec tion, and his explanation also." Atchison Explained. That's the way the matter was set tled. Mr. Atchison explained to the court and the jury that he knew noth ing whatever about the case; that Rad Lee handled it at the preliminary hearing and knew all about it, hence he turned it over to Lee. Robert Garver, assistant county at torney, sat in the case with Lee. Scott was assisted by Jay Jensen, who made the opening statement for the defense. NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE County Attorney Refuses Warrant to Woman Whose Chickens Were Stolen. Mrs. Gust Fink who lives at 532 Swygert avenue complained to the county attorney that some one wrung the necks of half a dozen of her Rhode Island Red chickens and left her the heads then poured kerosene in her well.

NATIONAL BANK ASK ABOUT SUFFRAGE Women In Gallery Unfurl Yellow Ban ner Before President. Washington, Dec. 5. The first dem onstration by suffragists such as "heckled" the British house of com mons in the past, occurred in congress here today while President Wilson was reading his annual message to a joint session of the house and senate. Soon after the president had start ed speaking, a big yellow silk banner was unfurled from the house gallery, by a group of suffrage sympathizers. It bore the inscription: "Mr. President, what will you do for woman's suffrage?" The banner was about four feet square and of yellow silk with the let tering in v. hite. A page was dispatched to the gal lery hurriedly and tore down the ban ner. The president went on with the reading of his speech, apparently giv ing the banner no attention, tho it was unfurled directly in front of him.

Y., filed petition in the district court today asking for the appointment of a re ceiver for the Queen City Oil & Gas company, the Laconia Oil & Gas com pany and J. r . W. KenKer, a director in both companies. The petition states that Hunt is a stockholder in both companies. He asks for an accounting in order that the stockholders may learn where they stand.

Rumor Asquith to Quit Denied. There was no confirmation of a widespread rumor that Asquith had determined to resign, but it was be lieved that he would do so rather than become a mere figurehead with Cloyd George in practically full charge of the conduct of war. Asquith Winner. London, Dec. 5. The Evening Star says: "The political crisis is over, so far as it is a trial of strength between Asquith and Lloyd George. Asquith has won. There will be no resigna tions and a reconstruction of the gov ernment will not take place. The failure of the cabal was due to the re fusal of the labor party to support it. They would not support George's plan on any terms and the plan, therefore, failed." LOCAL MENTION Economy Auto Baggage Co. Phone 1060. Adv.

It was "Anton day" at the Co-operative club luncheon at the Elks club. The members heard all about the tent and awning business from F. A. An ton of the Tdpeka Tent and Awning company. It was a turkey dinner with all the "fixin's" and some addi tional touches. Anton said, in part: "The tent and awning business is old and dates back as far as history, and in the profes sion have been found some of the greatest men the world has ever known, such as Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles. For forty years at least there has been in existence a tent and awning establishment of some kind in the city of Topeka. "We not only make tents and awnings but manufacture anything made of canvas or cotton duck, such as paulins, horse clothing, school bags, coin sacks, paper bags, canvas cots, and many other things made of can vas for the comfort and convenience of the people well behaved. To those ill behaved, we occasionally accommo date by making straight jackets, in our canvas department we cut up an nually about 150,000 yards of cloth of various kinds and grades. "We manufacture an awning arm the invention of myself and protected by a patent. This article is known as 'Anton's Lateral Arm and is used thruout the world." Besides the speech of Mr. Anton, a short talk was made by A. K.. Springer, the latest new member. Dr. C. B. Reed also made a report for the com mittee which carried the club's invi tation to the Kansas City Co-operative club to be present at a dinner dance to be held December 12 in Elk's hall in honor of the Co-operative clubs of St. Joseph, Wichita and Kansas City. No program is scheduled for the luncheon next Tuesday, but final ar rangements for the dance will be dis cussed.

DELAY IN GAS CASE Final Settlement of Receivership Is Matter of Doubt. Final settlement of the Kansas Nat ural Gas company receivership is matter of doubt and uncertainty. The case was to have been presented this week to Judge Flanneily of Mont gomery county, but has been delayed. Notices sent to . m. i re water, at torney general, announce that final settlement of the case will be delayed. He does not know how long a delay may be required.

HAS NO PEACE PLANS Gerard Declares He Is Carrying None uacK to bcrmany. New Tork, Dec 5. James W. Gerard, United States ambassador to Germany, returns to his post today bearing the views of President Wilson regarding submarine warfare and the deportation of Belgians for presenta tion to the imperial goverment. Be fore boarding his steamer, the Freder ick 

VIII, - Ambassador Gerard de clared he carried no peace plan back to Germany. JOHN COX KILLED (Contlppert from Page Ong.1 the entire side of the face was blown off, I saw afterwards. "I began running toward a farmer by the name of Woods, who was working in the field. I looked around and it seemed that Haskell and Biggers were running after me but later Biggers swerved to the right and that's the last I saw of him. Cox was dead when I got Woods and returned to his body. The shots entered on the right side of the face and the gun mustn't have been many inches from the deputy's face when it was fired." Biggers lives with his mother and two sisters. One sister, Melvina Big gers, shot and killed a man on Van Buren street about fifteen years ago during the progress of a lover's quar rel. She served two years in the state prison at Lansing. Biggers is about 20 years old. - Death Instantaneous. Cox had Just arrested the negro for hunting without a license, when, ac cording to the broken story told by the other colored men, the murderer threw his shotgun to his hip and fired point blank. The charge tore away the entire right side of the deputy s face, and some of it entered the brain. Death, according to Coroner O. F. Marcotte, was instantaneous. Immediately the negro who fired the shot turned and ran east on the road along which they had been hunt ing, while his two companions, terror ized by the act, ran towards C. E. Wood, who was plowing only a short distance away, crying to him that a colored man had shot a white man. They returned with him to the body, which was lying in the road. It is believed that the murderer ran east until he reached the bottom of a small valley 200 yards away, and then ran thru the hedge fence and down the valley. Wood, himself a deputy game war den, found Cox's body in the last quivers' of death, and instantly went to the telephone to notify the officers. In a short time several men had gath ered around. The two colored men remained with Wood all the time after running to him in the field, and were evidently in terror of what would happen to them. Their guns were taken from them and brought back to town by Coroner Marcotte, after he had - viewed the body and ordered it brought to To peka for an inquest. Cox Was Well Liked. Cox was sworn in as a deputy game warden only about a. : lonth ago, and was very well liked in his commun ity. He was the owner of a 28-acre farm adjoining the Forest Hill farm, owned by C. B. Wood, and some stock. His wife, who recently underwent a- operation at a Topeka hospital. was visiting at the home of a neigh bor some distance awav when the shooting; occurred. Their 12-year-old daughter. Jose phine, attends the Seabrook school. and was at school when her father met his death. Note of Tragedy. A sharp note of tragedy rang across the school grounds when the little girl, who alone knew where her moth er was to be found, was gently told that her father "had been hurt." With childish intuition, she guessed from the serious aspect of the doctor and the pitying countenance of the teacher that something terrible had happened. She had Just been called from play with her schoolmates dur ing the noon recess. Mrs. Lena Mc- Corbett, a friend of Mrs. Cox, took the little girl in the car with her as she went to find and notify Mrs. Cox of tne death of her husband. Following an examination of Lester Watts and Oscar Haskell who were the companions"of Claude Biggers at the time the shot was fired killing jonn jox, - county officers issued warrant this afternoon formallv charging Biggers with the murder. He is in the county jail. Biggers Writes Confession. Biggers was writing a confession to the murder of John Cox at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon. In this con fession', Biggers tells a different story than that told Joe Holman at the time of his arrest. He says he and Haskell were hunting together and that Cox approached them and demanded their license. Biggers demanded that Cox show his star and finally Cox to back up his demand leveled his rifle at Biggers. "I gave him the gun," said Biggers, "and we started off, walked about a block. I guess, when I stopped to roll a cigaret. Then I grabbed for Has. kell's gun and said to Cox: " 'Give me that gun.' "Cox leveled his gun at me and I fired." - Biggers told officers where he hid his coat and gun and the officers found them. They also discovered Cox's official paper showing that he had been appointed a deputy game warden. It had been torn to pieces and leads the officers to believe that Biggers went back to the body and searched it after the shooting. Shot at Billard? Biggers is also the man who shot at Billard during one of his flights Sun day, according to Buford, the negro arrested Sunday on the charge of shooting at the Topeka aviator. Bu ford was arrested by Officer George Jackson shortly after the shot was fired, and a gun was found in his pos session. Buford asserted according to Jackson that the gun belonged to Biggers and that Biggers had given the gun to him to conceal shortly after he had fired at the aeroplane. Aer-Duct Heaters at Forties's.

ARTHUR CAPPER. Governor 3. T. BOTKIN, Secretary of State. By . A. CORNELL. Asst. Secretary of State, PONT WANT HIM OUT Stafford County Citizens Object to Granting Bank Robber a Parole. Walter Berger, convicted in October, 1911, for participation in the robbery of the Hudson State bank, wants a parole. Protests were today filed with Governor Capper and it is probable that a hard fight will be made to keep Berger in prison. The case will be heard by the state board of corrections at a session in Hutchinson, Decem ber 23, With three other men, Berger Js alleged to have tried to rob the bank in the little Stafford county town. The night watchman gave the alarm and the men were driven from the bank before the safe was opened. In a run ning fight, the night watchman was shot. All of the men connected with the attempted robbery were caught. Berger drew a sentence of ten . to twenty years. "Heinie" Bauer, of Hutchinson, was among the men arrested. He was prosecuted .for the killing of a Hutch inson man and is now serving a life sentence at Lansing. All of the men implicated in the Hudson robbery were Hutchinson men. Since going to prison, Berger has been transferred to the state reforma tory at Hutchinson. Notices of his ap plication for a parole have been pub lished and many Stafford county peo ple have protested.
