PRESIDENT'S AMU. 1 MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Urges Placing Budget Under Uni fied System and Questions Utility of Further Income and Profits Taxation. WILSON WARNS OF UNREST. The President’s Recommendations. A budget system with one single au thority responsible for all appropria tions and expenditures and without the approval of which Congress cannot make appropriations. Legislation to protect new indus tries, especially the dyestuff industry. Legislation to remove the cause of political restlessness in the body poli tic and curb radicalism. Advancement of the program to pro vide farm lands for soldiers. Further legislation to bring down the cost of living. Fair play for labor and the estab lishment of the principles regarding labor laid down in the covenant in the League of Nations, in the realization “tnat the seed of revolution is repres sion.” in his remarks on labor President Wilson said: “The establishment of the principles regarding labor laid down in the cove nant of tho League of Nations offers U 8 the way to industrial peace and con ciliation. No other road lies open to us. * * * Governments must rec ognize the right of men to bargain col lectively for humane objects. * * * Labor must no longer be treated as a commodity." “The only way to keep men from agitating against grievances is to re move the grievances.” Washington.—General reoommenda tions on legislation to combat tlie high cost of living, labor unrest, radicalism and a readjustment of the nation to peace-time basis were the features of President Wilson’s annual message. The peace treaty, the President told Congress, will be discussed in a separate message later, as will the railroad question. For the second time only, since the President established tlie practice of addressing Con. ress in person, his message was rend by the clerks. The President’s principal recom mendations were: Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of tlie taxation sys tem with simplification of the income and excess profits. Readjustment of the tariff system, if necessary, to meet changed world conditions and make tlie system con form with the fact that the United States is “the greatest capitalist iu the world.” Relief for Soldiers. Recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world war, particularly In tbe way of government farms as proposed by Se< retary Lane. Proper measures to foster the dye stuffs industry built up during the war to keep tlie United States inde pendent of foreigu supply. An enlarged program for rural de velopment, in recognition of the farmers' part in rile war. Measures which “will remove the causes” of “political restlessness in our body politic.” At this point the President made his most extensive reference to the peace treaty by saying that tlie causes for the unrest “are superficial rather than deep seated” and that they “arise from or are connected with tlie failure ou tlie part of our government to ar rive speedily at a “just and perma nent peace permitting return to nor mal conditions, from tlie transfusion of radical theories from seething Eu ropean centers pending such delay, from heartless profiteering resulting from tlie increase of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear.” On the Cost of Living. The President renewed his recom mendations for legislation to deal ef fectively with “those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time tested institutions.” Several recommendations, some re newals of previous ones, went made by tli - President to bring down tlie cost of living. Among them were exten sion of tlie food control Saw to peace times for the emergency; regulations for transportation of foods in inter state comrae.ee; a cold storage law modeled after the law in New Jersey; a law requiring marks to show the length of time foods are kept In stor age, and a law to secure “competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits” by federal license of corpora tions selling food in interstate com merce. A long portion of tlie message was devoted to a discussion of the condi tion and rights of labor. “A definite program to bring about an improve ment in the conditions of labor and bring about a genuine democratization of Industry” was recommended. "Remove Grievances.” “Tlie only way to keep men from agitating against grievances is to re move tlie grievances,” said tlie Presi dent's message. At another point It declared “the seed of revolution is re pression.” “The establishment of the princi ples regarding labor, laid down in tlie covenant of the League uf Nations,' I said the message, “offers hs the wa. —. ■ 1 " " j*"ry ;. m*. 1 ** •" d- -p d- 4- •?•■!* •!• 4> 4 1 -F -I- *!• -r *!• -!• .;. d* + 

PRESIDENT'S PLEA FOR * + LOWERING OF TAXES * d* d* d* “Congress might well consider d* d- whether tlie higher rates of in- d d* come and profits taxes can in d? d* peace times he efficiently produc- d* d* live of revenue, and whether d* d* they may not, on the contrary, be d* d* destructive of business activity d d* and productive of waste and d* d* inefficiency.” v d- d* d* “There is a point at which in d* d* peace times taxes discourage d d- energy, remove incentive to new d* d- enterprise, encourage extrava- d* d* sauce and produce stagnation and d* Inefficiency.” d* + * d* “The world war has ended our d d* isolation and throws upon us a * d- great duty and responsibility." d* + * d- “No policy of isolation will d d- satisfy the growing needs and op- •5* v portmiities of Americn. The d* d* provincial standards and policies d* d* of the past, which have held d* d* American business in a straight- d* d- jacket, must yield and give way d* d- to the needs and exigencies of d* d- the new day in which we live.” d d- * d* d* d* d* d* d* d* d* d* d* d* d- d- d- d* d* to industrial peace and conciliation. No other road lies open to ns. * * * Governments must recognize the right of men to bargain collectively for hu mane objects. * * * Labor must no longer be treated as a commodity." “The right of individuals to strike is Inviolate,” continued the message, “and ought not to be interfered with by any process of government, but there is*n predominant r.gbt, and Hint is the right of government to protect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the chal lenge of any class.” The President was referring to tlie government’s recent injunction against the coal strike. Warns of Radicalism. The message closed with a pointed reference to radicalism and Red doc trines and referred to “Russia today with its blood and terror” as a “pain ful object lesson on the power of minorities.” “There are those In this country." said the message, “who threaten di rect action to force their will upon a majority. * * * It makes little dif ference what minority It is, whether capital or labor or any other class; no sort of privilege will ever be per mitted to dominate this country.” Orderly processes, the message de clared, were the only, ones by which relief and reform could lie obtained. “Those who would propose any oth er method of reform are enemies of this country,” the message said. * * Let those beware who take the shorter road of disorder and revo lution.'” I.nbor not only is entitled to an ade quate wage, the message states, but capital should receive a reasonable re turn upon Its investment and Is en titled to protection at the hands of tlie government in every emergency. When Strike Must Give Way. The right of individuals to strike is inviolate and ought not to be inter fered with by any process of govern ment, declares tlie President, but there is a predominate right and that is the right of the government to protect all of its people and to assert its pow er and majesty against the challenge of any class. The government, when it asserts that right, seeks not to an tagonize a class, but simply to defend the right of tlie whole people as against the irreparable harm and in jury that might be done by the at tempt by any class to usurp a powei that only government itself has a right to exercise as a protection to all. In conclusion the message says: “This Is the hour of test and trial for America. By her prowess and strength and the Indomitable courage of her soldiers she demonstrated hei power to vindicate on foreign battle fields her conception of liberty and justice. Let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weakened and her own failure to set tle matters of purely domestic con cern be proclaimed to the world. Fears Not Direct Action. “There are those in this country who threaten direct action to force their will upon a majority. Russia today, with its blood and terror, is a painful object lesson of the power ol minorities. It makes little difference what minority it is, whether capital or labor or any other class. No sort of privilege will ever be permitted to dominate this country. We are a partnership or nothing that is worth while. We are a democracy where the majority are the masters, or all the hopes and purposes of tlie men who founded this government have been defeated and forgotten. “In America there is but one way by which great reforms can be ac complished and the relief sought by classes obtained, and that is througli the orderly processes of representative government. Those who would pro pose auy other method of reform are enemies of this country. “America will not be daunted by threats nor lose her composure or calmness In these distressing times. We can afford, in tlie midst of ,tidis day of passion and unrest, to self contained and sure. The iij*trument of all reform In Amerlcia is the straight road of Justice to/all classes and conditions of men. Mfcn have but to follow this road to rw/lizc the full fruition of their ohjects aihd purposes. Let tbose beware who wAuld! take the shortly road of disordeMuid revolu tion.
