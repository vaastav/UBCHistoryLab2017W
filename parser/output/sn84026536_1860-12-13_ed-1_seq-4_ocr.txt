THE WILMINGTON" JOURNAL. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1860. The postage on this paper within the State, is cts. per quarter, out of the State 6J cts. per quarter. The Message. The really important portion of this document has already been laid before our readers, having been re ceived by telegraph. The President proceeds at once to the consideration Of the secession question, showing that the present con dition of the country is just what might have been ex pected to result from the constant agitation of the slavery question at the North. He refers to the action of South Carolina, affirms that secession is revolution i3 opposed to the use of force to coerce a State, but goes for collecting the duties and holding on to the forts in the harbors of any beced- incr States, the commanders of these forts acting on the defensive. The President goes into an elaborate argument against the doctrine ot the right of secession, and yet does not see that Congress is vested by the Constitution with any power to make war upon or subdue a State. lie recommends the adoption of certain amendments to the Constitution of the United States, said amend ments to be proposed by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States. . He proposes a certain explanatory amendment on three points relating to slavery. An express consti tutional recognition of the right of property in slaves the duty of protecting the right in the common Terri toriesan express declaration in reference to the deliv ering up of fugitive Blaves, The President refers at length to our foreign relations, which are generally peaceful and satisfactory. The President renews his recommendation for the ap pointment by Congress of some certain day previous to the 4th of March on each year of odd number for the election of representatives throughout the United States. The state of the Government finances requires a mod ification of the Tariff for the purpose of increasing the revenue. The President goes for specific duties in pre ference to ad valorem duties. "VVe publish to-day all that part of the Message bear ing on secession. It is ably written, and will be care fully weighed in this grave conjuncture of affairs. How They TalU. We have before us sundry papers from the North- leading papers of the opposition party we mean the triumphant Lincoln party, and they have pretty much all resumed the bullying tone which distinguished them duriDg the Presidential canvass, That moderate Republican paper, the Philadelphia TSTnrth American of Thursday the 5th inst., talks thus about coercion, treason, and so forth : The danger of permitting men to be drawn on in crime Ktj n nnrmrent relaxation of law. and a seeming release from the penalties incurred by such acts as have marked the recent course ot outn uaronna, is now very grcai. This growing belief in the possibility of seizing forts, of closing rivers and harbors and of putting up the framework of a southern confederacy is, in part, due to the fact that the great majority of the people feared false representation so much as to be unwilling to step forward and declare what the inevitable consequences would be. A partisan Executive is in power, who will not do his duty, and partisan presses at the north prefer to incite revolution, if they possibly can. Restrained by delicacy, the leaders of the victorious party in the elections are not willing to assume to speak for the gen eral public at once, and so the state of affairs has an as pect of relaxation and license of which the extremists at the south are determined to make the most. It is new our duty to arrest this easy sliding into trouble, even at the risk ot beincr falsely represented. It is our duty to There are times in the history of mankind when the boldest holds his breath for a time, when the national breathing may be said to stop in listening axten tion, and the ' national pulse to throb with such solemn emotion that its very beatiDgs may be counted. This is one of those times, if ever there was one. It is a time for solemn thought, for resolute action. It is not a time for wrangling or recriminations. Least of all should such recriminations be indulged by members of the same community men engaged in one cause identiGed in interest, who must sink or swim together. How do we stand? How do the North and the South stand towards each other in Congress ? How do Northern and Southern men meet each other in the common Territories ? What is the tone of the press ot the diSerent sections ? What of the churches3 ? What of theTtract societies ? What of anything? Can we disguise the dangers of the position ? The fight is openly begun already in Congress. Hule, of New Hampshire, has opened tho ball in the Senate, and IvcrsoQ, of Georgia, Urown of Mississippi, and others have responded defiantly. Divine Providence can avert disunion, and no less 1 T f 1 J il. ,f " 1 .. I. .Ul.Anf ft power can ao so. i-Ciuni u tin u jiaiuu, wiuiuui a miracle interposes to prevent it, this Union will inevita bly be dissolved. The amendments to the Constitution suggested by the President will never be made, nor would they be in time to do anything, even if made. We fear that the die is cast. Dissolution is inevitable. The President's Message is mxlerate enough in its way, but if its policy be carried out or attempted to be carried out, it must result in collision. The collection of the Revenue cf the- United States from States no longer membt rs of the confederacy, will be resented as an attempt to levy tribute. In dt-precating coercion, yet proposing to collect tribute, the President makes rather inconsistent recommendations. So in regard to the federal property, the title to it as pioperty is cer tainly in the federal go .rnment, and this will not be denied, but tie holding of foits by the General Govern ment, within the territories of seceded States will cer tainly be resisted. With the present spirit abroad in Congress among the people the churches the presses the territories everywhere, there can be slight hope of a peaceable ad justment. Is North Carolina to cry peace, peace, when she sees there is no peace ? Shall she not get ready for any emergency ? Shall she not see not only how she stands at home, but how she stands towards her sister States ? Shall she not call her people together in Con vention ? Shall she not prepare to risist aggression, if aggression should come ? Surely, we thir k that she should adopt all reasonable precautions, for the lime has come, or will soon have come.

That we do hereby raise our voices in solemn protestation against the sentiment which has produced the crisis in which our beloved country and its institu tions are involved by the recent election. That in view ot the toregoing considerations, it is in a State as in a territory ; the same jurisdiction in this respect over South Carolina as over Utah. The New York Tribune is, as usual, half rational and more than half insulting. It says, let the Southern States go, but let them take care how they go. The Tribune, as the flunkey of the new administration is really more arrogant and insulting than the most open advocates of coercion. A gentlemen who ha3 just been North tells us that there is no realizing sense there among the people, of the actual state of feeling at the South. All is looked upon as mere bravado.
