Our object is, of course, to win the war; and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to be diverted until it is won. But it is worth while asking and answering the question: Wheu shall we consider the war won f Nation Is Loyal. -From one point of view it is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the Amer ican people know what the war is about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose on it. As a nation we are united in spirit and intention. I pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dissent who does notf I hear the critieism and the clamor of the noisy thoughtless and troublesome. I arso see men here and there fliiig themselves in impotent disloyalty against the calm, in domitable power of the nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neith er its nature nor the way in which we may attain it with uplifted ryes and un broken spirits. But I know that Bone of these speaks for the nation.
