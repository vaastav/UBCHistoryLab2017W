PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. inton, Dec. 6. — Fellow Citizen* of !e and House of Representatives: D ratulate you on the continued and ing prosperity of our country. By the ' itivine Providence we have been during the past year with health,witli * harvests, witli profitable employ _ all our people, with contentment at ,nd with peace and friendship with jtions. occurrence of the twenty-fourth elec the chief magistrate has afforded an r iportunity to the people ot tlie United to exhibit to the world a significant I of the peaceful aud safe trausmis power and authority of government public servants whose terms of about to expire to their newly successors. This example cannot Impress profoundly the thoughtful peo her countries with the advantages publican institutions oiler. The gen cheerful acquiescence of all good cit the results of tlie election gives grati issurances to our country and to its throughout the world that ! a govern ed on tlie free consent of an i nielli d patriotic people possesses elements lgtli, stability and permanency not n any other form of government. TUE SOUTHERN QUESTION, nued opposition to the full and free [eut of the rights ot citizenship con ipon colored people by the recent ents to the constitution still prevails .I of the late slave states. It lias per il been manifested in tlie recent elec any large extent in acts of violence or lation. It has, however, by fraudulent in connection with ballots,with reg as to the places and maimer of vot id with counting, returning and can the votes cast, been successful in ig the exercise of the right preserva all rights—the right of suffrage,which Istilution expressly confers on our en d cttizeus. It is the desire of the sople of the whole country that sec ira as a factor in our polities should They prefer that no section of tlie should be united in solid opposition itlier section. The disposition to re irompt and hearty obedience to the ghts amendments to the constitution it now stands in the way of a com ibliteratiou of sectional lines in our contests. As long as these ameud tfaghiutly violated or disregarded,it assume that the people who placed the constitution as embodying the results of the war for the union, believe them to be wise and neces II continue to act together and to in it they shall be obeyed. The para [questiou still is as to tlie enjoyment of jvilege by every American citizen who requisite qualifications, to freely tust and to have it honestly counted, is question rightly settled the country relieved of the contentions of the ygones will indeed be bygones, and 1 and party issues with respect to tlie y aud efficiency of the administration, 1 improvements, the tariff, domestic , education, finance and oilier import jects will then receive their full share lition. But resistance to aud nullifi if the results of the war w ill unite to ll resolute purpose for their support maintain tlie authority of tlie govern 'd tlie perpetuity of tlie union, and equately appreciate tlie value of the [achieved. termination proceeds from no hostile it or feeling to atjy part of the people country or to any of their interests, »lability of tlie amendments rests fundamental principle of our gov They are the solemn expression of of the people of the United States, dînent that the constitutional rights r citizens must be maintained, does I weaker ; and it will continue to eon government of tlie couutry. Happily try of the late election shows that in rts of the country where opposition |15tU amendment lias heretofore pre cis diminishing and is likely to cease ; r if linn and well considered action is congress. the house of representatives and the 'Well have tlie right to judge of tlie Murni UI1( j qualifications of their hern, will see to it that every case of of tlie letter or spirit of tlie 15tli ®t>t is thoroughly investigated and unlit from such violation shall ae in y person or party, it will be the the executive, with sufficient uppro for the purpose, to prosecute unspar who have been engaged in depriv ■cus of the rights guaranteed to them bustitution. It is not, however, io lie |n that tlie best and surest guarantee 'binary rights of citizenship is to be " that capacity for self protection ,n belong only to a people whose right !rs »l suffrage is supported by universal '[>• The means at the command of i and state authorities are in many holly inadequate to furnish free in " to all who need it. This is especi where, before the emancipation, tlie 1,1 of the people was neglected or pre " the interest of slavery. POPULAR EDUCATION, convinced tliat tlie subject of popu iRation deserves tlie earnest attention ople of the whole country and witli wise and comprehensive action by turnout of the United States, I re [ y recommend that congress, by suit IrflB'slation aud with proper safeguards, tlie local educational fund in the 'tates wliere tlie grave duties and re lities of citizenship liave been devol »educated iieople, by devoting to that the proceeds of grants of tlie public 1 lll *> necessary, by appropriations treasury of tlie Uluted States, ** r tlie government can fairly do to free, popular education ought to be Vherever general education is found, [tue and social order prevail aud civ ligious liberty are secured. CIV H.

Abuses so Thev ' k " a,Ure cannot be tolerated, eul™™« » a,armin 8 *•«« the the I enlargement of the administration service, as the growth of the couutry in population im creases the required number of office« and policemen employed. The reasons are im perative for the adopliou of fixed rules for the regulation of appointments, promotion, pay bäviü^? 0V t 3, eS ? abllsllinB a Ulli,0rm method having exclusively in view in every instance the attainment of the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights ot all citizen* and the most economical and elTi cient administration of the public business. COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS In aid ot impartial appointments and promo tion have been conducted for several years past in several of the executive departments, and by nay direction this system has been adopted in the custom houses and post offices of the larger cities of the country. In the ity of New Y ork over two thousandlpersous n the civil service liave been subjected on their appointments aud tenure of place to the operation of published rules for this purpose during the past two years. The re sults oi these practical trials have been very satisfactory, and have confirmed my opinion in favor of this system of selection. All are subjected to the same test and the result is free from prejudice by personal favor or par tisan influence. It secures for the position applied for tlie best qualifications attainable among the competing applicants. It is an effectual protection from tlie pressure of im portunity which under any other course pur sued, largely exacts the time and attention of the appointing officers to their great detri ment in the discharge of other official duties. It prevents tlie abuse of the service for the mere furtherance of private or party pur poses, aud frees the employes of the govern ment from the obligations imposed by pat ronage, and allows them to depend solely upon merit for retention and advancement. With this constant incentive to exertion and improvement, tlie most valuable results have been attained in a high degree in the offices where the rules for appointment by competi tive examination have been applied. A method which lias so approved itself by ex perimental tests at points where such tests may be fairly considered conclusive, should be extended to all subordinate positions un der the government. I believe that a strong and growing public sentiment i emands immediate measures for securing and enforcing the highest possible efficiency in 'he civil service and its protec tion from recognized abuses, and that the ex perience referred to has demonstrated the feasibility of such measures. The examinations in the custom houses and postoffices have been held under many embarrassments and without provision for compensation for the extra labor therefor by the officers who have conducted them, and whose commendable interest in the public service has induced Lhis devotion of time and labor. Without a pecuniary reward, a continuance of these labors gratuitously ought no' to be expected, and, without an appropriation by congress for compensation, it is ifot practicable to extend the system of ex aminations generally throughout the civil service. It is also highly important that all such examinations shall be conducted upon a uniform system and under a general super vision. Section 1753 of the revised statutes authorizes the President tc prescribe for the regulation for admission to the civil service of the United States, and for this purpose to employ suitable persons to conduct the requi site inquiries with reference to "the fitness of each candidate in respect to llie age, health, character, knowledge and ability for tlie branch of service into which lie seeks to enter," but the law is practically inoperative for the want of the requisite appropriations. I therefore recommend an APPROPRIATION OF $'25,000 PEU YEAR to meet tlie expenses of a commission to be appointed by the President in accordance with tlie terms of this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform and efficient system of competitive examination and to supervise the application of the same through out the entire civil service of the government. I am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission will afford for the testing of the fitness of those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief to members ot congress as it will bo to the President and heads of departments, but that it will also greatly tend to remove the causes of embar iassment which now inevitably and constant ly attend the conflicting claims of patronage between tlie legislative and executive depart ments. The most effectual check upon tl alone. I also recommend such legislation as while leaving every officer as free as any other citi zen to express his political opinion and to use his means for their advancement, shall also enable them to feel as safe as any private cit izen in the refusal of a demand upon his sal ary for political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who are engaged in tlie public service, and likewise contain stringent provisions against the use of OFFICIAL AUTIIOHITY TO COERCE the political action of private citizens or of official subordinates is greatly to lie desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil service, and especial ly to reform in the method of appointment and removal, lias been found to be the prac tice under what is known as the spoils sys tem, by which the appointing power has been so largely encroached upon by members of congress. The first step in the REFOIÎM OK THIS VICE must ho a complete divorce between con gress and the executive in 'the matter of appointments. The corrupting doctrine that "to the victor belongs the spoils" is inseparable from congressional patronage as the established rule and practice of parties in power. II seems to he under to ate is of jnniivn in h u» umiir stood by applicants lor office and by the people generally,that representatives and senators are entitled to disburse the pai ° f their respective districts aud state, it is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting from this id vasiou of the executive functions. The tone, principles of the government on the subject of appointments to office as stated in the national conventions of the I ^ » . v *-''ii v X— 11 iiiV/ilo U 1 tUE leading parties of the country, have again and again been approved by the American people, and have net been called in question in any quarter. These of an of of is j gre ... ----- of i tion of measures which seemed to mr i" | l ie proper to he taken ley this government authentic expressions of public opinion upon this all important project, are the statement of principles that belong to the constitutional structure of the gov ernment. Under the constitution the president and heads of departments are to make nominations for office; the sen ate is to advise and consent to appoint ments, and the house of representatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless offi cers. The best interest of the public ser vice demands that these distinctions be respected; that senators and representa tives who may be judges and accusers should not dictate appointments to office, ro this end the co-operation of the legis lative departments of the government is requested. Members of congress will not be relieved from the demands made upon them with reference to appoint ments to office until by legislative enact ment the pernicious practice is con demned ami forbidden. It is therefore recommended that an act be passed de nning the relations of members of con gress with respect to appointment to office by tlie president, and I also recom mend that the provisions of sections 17(i(i and of sections following of the re vised statutes comprising the tenure of office act of March 2d, 1867, be repealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our country is one of the highest and most important duties of statesmanship, and that it can be permanently done only by the co-operation of tlie legislative 'and executive departments of the govern ment. I again recommend the whole sub ject to your consideration and attention. THE MOBMOX QUESTION. It is the recognized duty and purpose of tlie people of the United States to suppress polygamy, where it now exists in our territories, and to prevent its ex tension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made by the United States au thorities in Utah to enforce tlie laws against it. Experience lias shown tliat legislation upon this subject, to he effec tive, requires execution, modification and amendment. The longer action is delayed, the more difficult it will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polygamy has the whole power of making and executing tlie local legis lation of the territory. By its control of the grand and petit juries it possesses large influence over the administration of justice. Exercising, as the heads of this sect do, the local political power of the territory, they are able to make effec tive their hostility to the law of con gress on the subject of polygamy, and in fact to prevent its enforcement. Polyg amy will not lie abolished if the enforce ment of law depends on those who prac tice it and uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political power of the sectwhich encour ages and sustains it. The power of con gress to enact suitable laws to protect the territories is ample. It is not safe for half-way measures. The political power of the Mormon sect is increasing. It controls now one of our wealthiest and most populous territories. Wherever it goes it establishes polygamy and sectarian political power. The sanc tity of marriage and the family relations are the corner stone of our Amer ican society and civilization. Religious liberty aud tlie separation of church and state are among the elemen tary ideas of free institutions. Tlie re establishment or the interests and prin ciples which polygamy and Mormonism liave imperilled', fully reopens to the intelligent and virtuous immigrants of nil creeds that part of our domain which has been in a great degree closed to gen eral immigration by intolerant and im moral institutions.

FDREIliN 

RELATIONS. Our relations witli all foreign countries have been the.se of undisturbed peace, and liave presented no occasion tor coer bay in January, 1878, which I expressed in'my last annual message, was disaj» pointed. This answer was received only in the latter part of April in the present year, and when received exhibited a lau ure of accord between the two gov ernments. As to the measure of inshore fishing, the privilege- secured toour ti-h ermeii by the treaty of Washington are of so serious a character that 1 mam n the subject of a communication to eon l I recommended mead qe |hmrt y ■ v • . , the in the maintenance ot the rights ..■ i< id j ed our fishermen under the treaty ami pai- towards securing indemnity ;or the i i i" of of Jury these interests had suffered. A bill to carry out these recommendations was under consideration by the house of representatives at the time of the ad journment of congress in June last. Within a few weeks I have received a communication from Her Majesty'sgov ernment renewing a consideration of the subject—both of indemnity for in juries at Fortune Bay, and of the inter pretation of the treaty in which the pre vious correspondence had shown the two governments to be at variance. Upon Jotli these topics a disposition towards a friendly agreement is manifested by the recognition of our right to indemni ty for the transactions at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure of such indemnity to further conference, and by an assent to the views of this government as pre sented in previous correspondence, that the regulation of conflicting interests of the shore fisheries of the provincial sea coasts and the vessel fishery of our fish ermen should be made tlie subject of conference and concurrent arrangement between the two governments. I sin cerely hope a basis may lie found for a speedy adjustment of the very serious divergence of views on the interpreta tion of the fishery clauses of tlie treaty of Washington, which, as the corres pondence between the two governments stood at the close of the last session of congress, seemed irreconcilable. ART 

EXHIBITION. In the important exhibition of arts and industries which was held last year at Sydney, New South Wales, as well as that now in progress at Melbourne, the United States liave been efficiently and honorably represented. Exhibitors from this country at tlie former place received a large number of awards in some of the most considerable depart ments, and the participation of tlie United States was recognized to be a special mark of distinction. In the ex hibition at Melbourne, tlie share taken by our country is no less notable, and an equal degree of success is confidently ex pected. £ DIPLOMATIC AND COMMERCIAL. O'he state of peace aud tranquility now ei{Joyed by all tlie nations of tlie contin ent of Europe, has its favorable influ ence upon our diplomatic and commer cial relations with them. We have concluded and ratified a convention with tlie French republic for the settlement of jplaims of tlie citizens of each country against the other. Under this conven tion, a commission, presided over by a distinguished public man, appointed in pursuance of the requestof both nations, by his majesty tiie emperor of Brazil, has been organized anti has begun its session-in this city. A congress for the protection of industrial property has been in session in Paris, to which Ï have appointed the ministers of the United States in France and Belgium as dele gates. The international commission upon weights and measures also contin ues its work in Paris. I invite your attention to tlie necessity of an appro priation to be made to enable this gov ernment to comply with its obligations under tlie metrical system. Our friendly relations with the German em pire continue without interruption. At the recent international exhibition of fish and fisheries at Berlin, the partici pation of the United States, notwith standing the haste with which the com mission was forced to make its prepara tions, was extremely successful and meritorious, gaining for private exhibi tors numerous awards of a high class and for the country at large the principal prize of honor offered by his majesty tlie Emperor. The results of this great success cannot but be advantageous to this important and growing industry. There have been some questions raised between the two governments as to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties of civilization, but recent dis patches from our minister at Berlin show favorable progress is making toward the understanding in accordance with tlie views of this government which makes and admits of no distinction what ever between the rights of natives and naturalized citizens of tlie United States. The complaints of molestation suffered by naturalized citizens aboad, were never fewer than at the present time. There is nothing to note in our unbroken friendly relations witli the governments of Austria, Hungary, Russia. Portugal, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Greece. Dur ing last summer several vessels belonging to the merchant marine of this country sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were fired at, boarded mid search ed by an armed cruiser of the Spanish government. Circumstances us reported, involve not only private injury to per sons concerned, but all seemed too little observant of the friendly relations exist ing for a century between this country and,Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish government liy serious protest-anil remonstrance and the matter is undergoing an investiga tion by the royal authorities with a view to sueit explanation or reparation as may be called for by the facts. Tlie commis sioners sittiiig'in tliis city for the adju dication of the claims of our citizens against the government of Spain, is, I hope, approaching the termination of its ; j.,|[ ors *pi u > claims against the United ! States under the Florida treaty with Spain were submitted to Congr inVîie your attention to this long stan.l lire question, with a view to a final dis a of to to is for its session and I again only lau gov ti-h are n eon qe itkui of the matter. At an invitation of the Spanish government, a conference has recently been held at the city of Madrid, to consider the subject of pro tection hv foreign powers of native moors in the empire ot Morocco. Hie minister of tlie United States in Spain was directed to take part in the deliher to a The in An ing last ial the at to a of mtoivnci m ention signed on behalf powers represented. Hie niions of tlii which is a of all tit- . ... , , in-i ruinent will be laid betöre the Sen ate for its consideration. The govern ment of the United States also lias lost urge upon tluit ot tlie the result of , no Ol)lH»rtUlUtV to urge Upon UKU ui me id ,11. Yl'orooco the necessity, in ae ami e. 1 [ tlu . humane and enlight i i- >>■ fciiod spirit of the age, of putting an end to the persecutions which have been so prevalent in that country of persons of a faith other than Manommedan, and especially Hebrew residents of Morocco. The consular treaty concluded with Bel gium has not yet been officially promul gated owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the senate of the United States, which occasioned a delay during which the time allowed for its ratification expired. The senate will be asked to extend the period for its ratification. An attempt to negotiate a treaty of ex tradition with Denmark failed on ac count of the objection of the Danish government to the usual course, provid ing that each nation should pay the expense of the arrest of prisoners, for whm extradition is asked. CHINESE TREATY. Tlie provision made by congress at its last session for the expenses of the com mission which has been appointed to enter upon negotiations witli the imper ial government of China on subjects of great interest to the relations of the two countries, enabled the'eommissioners to proceed at once upon their mission. The imperial government was prepared to give prompt and respectful attention to the matter brought under negotiation, and the conference-proceeded with such rapidity and progress that on the 17th of November last two treaties were signed at Pekin, one relating to the introduc tion of Chinese into this country, and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot, one of the commissioners, is now on his way home with the treaties, and it is ex pected they will be received in season to be laid before the senate early in Jan uary. JAPANESE TREATY. Our minister in Japan has negotiated a convention for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked seamen. I take occasion to urge once more upon congress the propri ety of making provision for the erection of suitable fire-proof buildings at the Japanese capital for the use of the Amer ican legation, and a court-house and jail connected with it. The Japanese gov ernment, with great generosity and courtesy, has offered for this purpose an eligible piece of land. In my annual message I culled the attention of con gress to tlie subject of the indemnity funds received some years ago from Chi na and Japan. I renew the recommen dation then made, that whatever por tions of these funds are due to Ameri can citizens should be promptly paid and the residue returned to tlie nations respectively to which they justly and equitably belong. 

OTHER TREATIES. Tlie extradition treaty with tlie King dom of the Netherlands,which has been for some time in course of negotiation, lias, during tlie past year,been concluded and duly ratified. Relations of friendship and amity have been established between tlie gov ernment of the United States and that of Iloumania. We have sent diplomatic representatives to Bucharest, and liave received at this capital a special envoy who lias been charged by His Royal Highness Prince Charles' to announce the independent sovereignty of Rou mania. We hope for a speedy develop ment of commercial relations between tlie two countries. RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of quiet on tlie borders between this country and Mexico would soon become so assured ns to justify the modification of orders then in force to our military commanders in regard to crossing tire frontier, without encouraging such disturbances as would endanger tlie peace of the two countries. Events moved in accordance with these expectations, and the orders were ac cordingly withdrawn to the entire satis faction of our own citizens and of the Mexican government.Subsequedntly the peace of the border was again disturbed by a savage foray under the command of Chief Victoria, but by the continued and harmonious action of the military forces of the two countries bis band has been broken up and substantially destroyed. There is reason to believe that the ob stacles which have so long prevented the rapid and convenient communica tion between the United States and Mex ico by railways are on the point of dis appearing, and that several important enterprises of this character will soon I set on foot, which cannot fail to contrib ute largely to the prosperity of this country.
