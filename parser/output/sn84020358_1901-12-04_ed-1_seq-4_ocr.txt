President Roosevelt's message is six or eight thousand words ehorter than it was expected to be, but it Is still long enough. Long a It Is, it will be more read than Presidents' messages usually are, for there was much curios ity to know how the new President would deal with some of the important matters which were before him for consideration. It will not be denied that he has dealt with them In an inter esting and forcible way, whatever may be thought of the soundness of eorae of his views. He is apparently not afraid to eay what he thinks and the message is not a "trimming" one. He epeaks strongly against anarchy and anarchists. He is for continued protection, with such reciprocity as wont hurt protection. He wants to see the Chinese exclusion law re-enacted. He would have the light of publicity thrown on the trusts, but he would not have business interfered with in a spirit of rashness or ignorance. He wants an Isthmian canal, a big navy, a new cabinet officer to be known as Secretary of Commerce and Industries, irrigation of arid lands, intelligent for estry, strict adherence to the Monroe doctrine, a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines, merit in office, and the In dian as an individual and not aa a member of a tribe. Those who read the message will feel sure that the President wrote it him self, and they will also feel sure that he means to be a leader rather than a follower. The document will, we think, make a good Impression both in this country and in Europe. It is more con servative than some expected it would be, but it Is strong and forcible enough to show that its author hae a very de cided mind of his own, and a very definite conception of his duty. tions were collected from Polish stu dents. It assumed for the benefit of the accused that they were ignorant of the ultimate alms of the league, and ac cepted their explanation that they con sidered its object to be the promotion of a Polish national sentiment. The plea that it was merely Jn order to avoid attracting the attention of the Russian authorities that secrecy had been observed in the conduct of the league and of the societies dependent on it was not considered valid. Secret societies are forbidden by Prussian law if their object relates in any way to public affairs, and it was clear from the evidence that the societies to which the accused belonged came under this prohibition. If the Poles at Posen want to con tinue to conspire they will have to be more secret about it than they have been. They are not going to be allowed to carry on with impunity any move ment in the direction of separation. If any one bids 25 cents more the watch is immediately sold.

It gives us pleasure to be able to help such people to realize their ambition. A Chicago publishing firm sends out a circular an nouncing the proposed publication of a biographical encyclopedia which shall Include the names of all people worth knowing, or, to be precise, of "all peo ple who have attained any prominence whatever." It is hoped, says the circu lar, that all will be sufficiently alive to the Importance of such a work and the lasting benefit to be derived from plac ing their names, side by side with those of our most honored ones, in a volume that will be found In public libraries and reading rooms throughout the world, and which is ultimately destined to go down to posterity as an enduring record of the most eminent people of the nineteenth century. All are ad monished not to withhold, through mo tives of false modesty or pride, the in- formation required, and those persons entitled to representation should, through themselves or their friends, see that their names are sent In and all facta correctly reported, bearing In mind 4hat without such a record the most illustrious names would be lost In oblivion and their posterity deprived of the gratification and advantage of ref erence to an honorable ancestry. Here's your chance. Those who don't want their posterity deprived of the gratification and advantage of refer ence to an honorable ancestry should communicate immediately with the Chi cago publishers. "All people who have attained any prominence whatever" is comprehensive and generous. "Oh, this time his death proved fa tal," declared the Croas-Eyed Boarder. Pittsburg Chronicle-Telegraph. 'H'm!

Chicago Tribune, It May Mean All Sorts of Trouble to Half a Dozen California Villages. While drilling for oil in the great de sert of , southern California known aa the Colorado Desert an Indio oil com pany tapped what appeared at first sight to be the infernal regions, but which proved to be a Blumbering vslU cano. The sleeping giant immediately awoke when the drill dropped into bis fiery nest and the result was Indeed startling to the drillers. . The drill had reached a depth of but 500 feet, and as It was expected that It would be necessary to go at least twice that depth to find oil, the workmen were not looking for a strike of any kind. It required extreme activity on their part to escape from the derrick when there came rushing up from the well a hiss ing, roaring stream of steam, gas, hot mud, rocks and brackish water. The volcanic substance shot several hun dred feet into the Jr and fell in a de structive shower about the derrick. The drilling tools were thrown from the hole and the aperture made by the drill was rapidly enlarged as the roaring torrent continued to rush skyward. Within the confines of the desert, though several miles from the location of the volcanic wejl, is a region known as "The Volcanoes." This tract Is more the.n a mile in extent and con- I tains hundreds of cones and peaks varying In height from afew feet to more than a hundred feet, from which flow East. German lines are steadily push ing the English to one side, and for very good reasons. Subsidy does not make good Bteamship lines. On the con , trary, it is apt to majce tbem indifferent to wholesome competition. The trouble with English lines to-day is that they are managed in the spirit which pre vailed fifty years ago. The British steamers going to the Cape give such bad food that no. one who has tried them once we,nts to do so again. Out to China no one cares to go on a British steamer who has ever travelled by a German, French or Japanese one. The German studies the needs of his passen gers; the Briton is indifferent., The Peninsular and Oriental, a heavily sub sidized British line to the Far East, charges sixpence (12 cents) for a drink of lemonade. The German steamers pass lemonade around as we do Ice wa ter. The British ships afford no laun dry facilities on a Journey lasting five or six weeks; the German line has an excellent Chinese laundry on each ship, so that in the tropics all can wear suit able garments. There are dozens of minor items in which the Briton fia,Us to meet the reuirements of modern times.

In a little house in South .Washington is located a federal Institution without which the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum could not exist.

A fOLISll COMSPIRACX. It is interesting to notice that in the recent trial of Polish studenis at Posen, which ended ln the sentencing of several of the accused to long terms of imprisonment, the court held that it had been established that a league was In existence to re-establish the kingdom of Poland. As the attainment of this object would Involve the detach ment of districts that were formerly Polish from their present allegiance to Prussia and to the German empire, the operations of the league, of course, were, treasonable. The court based its conclusion on the fact that a so-called "Polish national treasure" existed in RapperBWjr""'' wh Iph. contribu- One of the Ways in Which the Unwary Are Trjcked Out of Money. Recently there have been added to the city's, heterogeneous commerce several little shops which offer for sale, mostly at auction to the highest bidder and to the only bidder, too, if his bid be high enough, jewelry and other articles that go under the name of unredeemed pledges. There are tricks In all trades and this particular trade is the subli mation of all tricks. In the first place there Is something alluring in the term "unredeemed pledges." i All Buch stores employ them with phe nomenal lungs, who cry their wares in basso profundo. In one of them there Is a fellow with a voice that would be conspicuous ln a den of roaring lions. He is always coherent and the volume of breathy sound that comes from bis I mouth seems to be reverberated from I every surface in the establishment. Generally he is telling the mprlts of a certain watch, or the price he has Just been offered for the timekeeper, and as a passing pedestrian reaches the door ways he raises his voice a little, which secures an involuntary turn of the head. Often curiosity Is aroused and the passerby goeB ln to Investigate. When one enters the Bhop the "auc tioneer" is probably announcing he has Just been offered a ridiculously low price for a fine pair of earrings. Gentlemen, are you going to let this elegant pair of earrings go at that price?" he asks, and there seems to be a genuine distress in his voice. Perhaps the next article offered is a watch. "Ah! What have we here? A watch? Well, so It la, and a beauty, too." And then he goes on to tell how the owner uL liio waicn was rnrrpn in purr with It. It is always a pathetic tale. Young man; health failing for a long time; no money saved; mother dies suddenly; the watch Is pawned to pay for the funeral of the dear old lady. He sighs deeply, but stifles his emo tion and proceeds with the sale. Look at this watch and tell me what you think of it," he says to a tall Indi vidual standing near the showcase. "I have no need of a watch," replies the man. "But look at it. You don't need to buy it." A critical examination of the watch follows and then the man who "had no need of it" offers perhaps $5. The bid Is at firet scorned, but after much talk la reluctantly accepted. ' , sulphurous vapors. Over the whole re gion bangs a dense cloud of steam and noxious gases which taint the air. This tract lies from 200 to 300 feet below the level of the sea, as also the land upon which the Indio Oil company's well Is located. A few miles away rises the towering peak of od Mount San Jacinto, which, though having an elevation above the level of the sea of but 10,997 feet, Is the highest mountain above the level of the surrounding country in the United States, for its bass lies below the sea. The region about th!s moun tain has long been the field of frequent earthquakes, light shocks being felt ev ery fe wdays and as recently as last February one paroxysm was of so se vere a nature as to cause the loss of six lives. The general opinion has long prevail ed that old San Jacinto is preparing to develop Into a volcano. It would now appear that the earth for some distance about Is but a thin crust over a menac ing danger. The well of the India com pany continues to cough and spout Its volcanic matter and the earth for many rods around shakes and trembles vio lently. What the developments will be is hard to conjecture. Not many miles from this strange well is the locality known as the "Salt Desert." This Is a tract of land of a thousand or more acres which lies 300 feet below the level of the sea and has the appearance of a vast field of snow. Over the' entire tract lies a bed of salt varying in depth from six to sixteen Inches. Seventeen years ago the Liver pool Salt company took possession of the land and began to harvest the salt from this exposed mine. ' There have been, since the establishment of the works there, 2,000 tons of salt per year taken from the field, and yet but ten acres have been worked. As fast as the salt is removed a new crust is formed from the water of salt springs there. The water Is rapidly evaporated by the rays of the sun, which Is seldom ob scured by clouds and which Induce a temperature often reaching 120 to 110 degrees. Should a volcano of consider able size and activity develop, this val uable plant, together with the villages ! of Salton, Indio, Walters, Drumld, Frink, Volcano Springs, Flowing Wells and Tortugo, all of which lie below the eve of the sea woud be in danger of ex termination. The outcome of the vol canic well will be watched with a deal of interest and anxiety by the residents of these towns. From the Louisville Courier-Journal. ' V i 

GOOD FORM IN THE BRITISH ARMY. . In the army the form of regiments differs immensely, and who shall say whether the ante-room which resounds with the clatter of spurs, the many laughs, the occasional anathema, the constant pop of soda water corks, Is a temple of better form or worse than other ante-rooms where the tone is as quiet as that of an Oxford common room? There are many stories told against regiments, generally cavalry ones, which do not show them quite at their best in the matter of form. There is no more distinguished, more hospita ble, more charming reg'ment than the 10th Hussars, but "the 10th don't dance" is always a tiny black mark against them. There is the tale of how Soth ern, unwarrantably importuned to re rite something after mess, played the drunken scene from "David Garrlek," and swept the dining table of glass and crockery. There Is the anecdote of the shred of cotton which accompanied a refusal on the part of a regiment of an Invitation from a north country mag nate. There Is also the story of the postman and the cards, which is not so well known. A regiment arrived at a country town, and the local gentry call ed on the mess. The officers who were "told off" to leave the regimental card as a return compliment fuuud the duty wearying and intrusted the pasteboard squares to the local postman, who agreed to give them to the servants when he knew that the people to be called on were "out." A butler or par lormaid did not appreciate the Gilhert ian humor of the arrangement, and the gentry of the town are even now given to sharp words if asked whether the postman has left a reg'mental card on them lately.
