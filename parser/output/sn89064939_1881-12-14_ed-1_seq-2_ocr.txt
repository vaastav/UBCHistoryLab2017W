9*H "1UHP' *$fc*mvm^ .TW asrs"w "crXiS^, a^xarar Wednesday, December the]14,1881 The wife of the late President Garfield has been given the frank ing privelegea bill to that effect passing the Senate last week. The President last Monday nom inated Frederick L. Frelirghuysen as Secretary oi State. The nomina. tion was promptly confirmed hy the Senate. There are thirteen contested seats in the present House of Representa tives-all from the south except two, Iowa and Maine, from which two States Greenbackers contest the seats now held by Republicans. Hon T. P. O'Connor, M. P., ad dressed a large and enthusiastic au dience in the St. Paul Opera House last Sunday evening. The saintly city did itself proud in honoring Erin's chosen envoy. An international skating contest is something new under the sun. The Vienna skating club is arrang ing for such a contest, to take place on the 14th, 15th and 16th of Janu ary. All skaters of northern Europe and America are invited. Valuable prizes will be given. The Celtic World is the name of a new Irish-Catholic paper just started in Minneapolis, McCann, Wood & Co., publishers. The initial number of the Celtic World gives token that it will be a strong rival of the Northwestern Chronicle. The St. James Journal thinks that the easiest and quickest way to try, convict and execute Guiteau is for Judge Cox to dismiss the case and set the assassin tree. He would be ready for the undertaker in less than 24 hours. As it now is the qh^nces are good that he will die of ojd age before the trial closes. The annual report of the Secreta ry of State for the fiscal year ending November 30,1881, will show that there were filed 174 instruments cre ating corporations and modifying former articles and sixty-eight affi davits of publication of incorpora tion. Of the articles filed 142 were of new corporations, and of these sixteen were of new railroads. Dakota is pushing for a division and admission as two separate States as well as for measures to secure de velopement. One of its proposed measures provides that "any citizen who shall sink an artesian well in such manner as to obtain a perma nent flow of water upon any of theobjections unoccupied public lands where there is no stream or spring of living wa ter, shall be entitled to 640 acres of land." Some very damaging testimony was given in the Guiteau case last week, and the criminal begins to re alize that his case is getting desper ate. Scoville, Guiteau's counsel, still keeps up a brave fight, but the evidence of some of the witnesses produced by the prosecution last week was even too much for him, and he lost his temper on several oc casions. As the trial progresses the prospects that the assassin will swing grows better and better. The St. Paul and Sioux City rail road company's land department has equipped one agent for Scotland another for England and Wales and a third for Norway, all to start on their missions some time next week. And by New Years the company will have 20 to 25 agents at work in various parts of Europe, organizing emigration to colonize its lands in the southwestern counties of Min nesota. The-postal savings bank system, of which so much has been said and written, is likely to become an es tablished fact in the near future. The plan proposed by P. M. GenBaden James is, for a 2 per cent, rate of interest, the credit of the U. S. pledged for the payment to the de positor of every sum deposited, no one person to deposit more than $500 in one year, nor have on depos it at any time more than $1500, and the system to be self-sustaining. The system will be a good thing for everybody, a it will be perfectly safe, and furnish a convenient de pository for small savings. The American Book Exchange of New York has failed, after stagger ing under a heavy load for several months The company made a brave fight to give the people cheap books and succeeded in placing in-their hands at half-price the best litera ture of the world. The failure is al most a calamity to the country, but John Alden, the manager, informs the public that anew company, the Universal Knowledge Publishing Company, has been organized and that the great "Library of Univer sal Knowledge" and other equally useful books will continue to be sent out promptly on receipt of order ac companied with the cash. A recent number of Puck con tains a cartoon that, shorn of the usual absurdities in the line of cari. catures, tells a story that is worth repeating here. Uncle. Sam stands upon a rock on this side of the ocean holding in his hand a rod under which the waters are divided. Two by two between the walls of water, come along line of men, women and children who have been driven from the Old World because they are the children of Abraham, and their faith is that of Jacob and of Moses. The modern Egypt has driven them forth, and they are seeking a land of peace and refuge in this newer and freer portion of God's earth. Some of them are rich and bear treasures in their hands, while wme are poor, but side by side thev march through, the Red Sea to the land of their' deliverance. tm -*j A series of frightful calamities oc curred last week. On Thursday eve ning a theater was burned in Vienna, Austria, and over nine hundred pers ons perished in the flames On Friday sixty-six persons were killed by an explosion in a Belgian coal mine, and forty were drowned in a shipwreck in the Bay of Biscay. A terrible holo caust occurred at Rock Cut, seven miles from Pittsburg, Saturday morn ing about three o'clock, by which 16 men were burned to death and a large number fatally burned. Thefireoc curred in a boarding shanty, and of the forty persons known to have been sleeping in the building, only 24 esin caped alive, and evenjthey were more or less burned. Several lives were al so lost earlier in the week by a Mis souri railroad bridge disaster. The President's message was sent to Congress last week Tuesday. We intended to publish the message in full this week, but the document is too lenehty and we publish only a bouthalf of it in this issue. Themes sage commences with a tribute to our assassinated President Garfield, and is an able business-like docu ment from beginning to end, and is highly commented on by the Metro politan journals of every shade. The New York Times comments upon the message as follows: The first message of President Arthur is a very careful and well matured docu ment. Its tone is more frank and direct than is customary in such pa pers and its recommendations show that the president has patiently reviewed the field of labor so recent ly and so unexpectedly opened before him, and that he is not inclined to shirk the constitutional duty of aid ing congress by his suggestions and advice. On most points which Mr. Arthur touches he expresses himself with clearness and good judgement. The Impeached Judge.

The demands. fense takes a line not* anticipated. Judge Cox does not take the trouble to deny the charges made in the arin ticle, but rests upon the cool assump tion that the acts charged do not con stitute crimes and misdemeanors sub jecting him to impeachment. He claims that crimes and misdemeanors are indictable offenses that drunk eness and lewdness are not indictable offenses hence that drunkeness and lewdness are neither crimes nor mis demeanors. The whole case will probobly hinge on this point, though it is suggested that perhaps the Sen ate may take the ground that they are the judges of what crimes and misdemeanors are. The defendant's attorneys confidently expect that the will be sustained, but others whose opinions have weight think differently. The Senate met yesterday to hear the objections offer ed by the defense, but it is hardly probable that the requests of the res pondent's attorneys that he be dis missed and discharged will be grant ed.
