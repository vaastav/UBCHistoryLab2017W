It tho President of the United States r - w.is limited to one term in office all fa trim presidents would bo ns independent an I tairlcss ns the president incumbent F.-fHident Roosevelt dechred that he would not accept arenomination, and by this declaration he placed himself in a position of independence that has en abled him to fearlessly carry forward the reforms in which the people are so vi . tally interested . and in all ways to ad minister the duties of his office in ac s. cordauce with his ideas of justice and a ' square deal for all men. No man whose '. thoughts wero centered upon his own " ' succession would have dared to antagon ize so ninny conflicting intereft. In . spite of his popularity among the masses . it is very doubtful if Roosevelt could be j ciciu-i, uiuuii ue woum prooauiy se cure a majority, or at least a plurality, of thi popular vote. The solid South is ' still solid, and its votes in the electoral college can conn" lently be relied upon for the democratic nominee. Then the battle will rage in New York, Indiana, Connecticut and Illinois. New York is 4 more than doubtful, atid in the other States the Democracy may have a fight ing chance. Why should any Democrat 1 vote tor Roosevelt in preference to Brv- ant In the matter of controlling the corporations they are as one, with the exception that Bryan goes much farther than the President, while on the tariff the President is a Republican of the itraitest sect. In the close States cor- .. pore t ion influence and wealth might torn the scale in favor of a Democrat, as the corporations are shrewd enough to know that a Democratic president with - a Republican congress would not be able . to enact any very radical legislation. Doubtless President Roosevelt foresaw this and his declaration fora siugle term i was a declaration of individual inde pendence for which the common people 01 this country may be truly thankful. It has enabled him to demonstrate that no corporation or individual is so - wealthy or powerful as to be above the law, and no individual so humble as to be beneath its protection. He has brought about the beginning of a peace , ful revolution which it may well be has averted a bloody one. He has taken away the excuse for anarchy and shown the American people that they have within themselves the power to abolish by peaceful methods existing evils and prevent their recurrence.

Ii KMl'LOYKIW LI.VItLK, following is an extract from tin President's message to Congress that is of interest to people of a county, which like Columbia, have so manv men in jured or killed in developing its resources: Compensation for accidents or death U ne In any line of industry to the actual conditions under which that industry is carried on, should be paid by that por tion 01 me community (or the benefit of! which the industry Is carried on that I is, by those who profit by the industry. i me enure traoe nsK is placed upon Clemtnens Mailer to Lewis mo rmpiutrr no win promptly ami properly add it to the legitimate cost of production and assess it proportionately upon the consumers of his commodity. It is therefore clear to my mind that the law should place this entire "risk of a trade" upon the employer. Neithet the Federal law nor, as far as I am in formed, the state laws dealimr with the question of em plovers' liability are suf ficiently thoroughgoing. The Federal law should of course include employes in Navy-yards, arsenals and the like. Doubtless there could be arguments put forth on the other side of this ques tion. Upon rending what President Roosevelt says, one naturally thinks of the many accidents that are of almost daily occurrence in the logging camps of Oregon and Washington. The men employed in the camps receive good wages, but the risks in some parts of the business are considerable. The President says that if the entire responsibility for accidents was Dittoed upjii the employer he would consider it one of the necessary expenses of his businesi and put it iuto the price of his commodity. Anyhow, it seems that those dependent upon the men injured while laboring for the advancement of an industry and to enrich his employer should be aided by said industry and emplover.
