THE GREENVILLE JOURNAL PRESIDEIiT IELL5 WORLD ABA'S US Ifl THE 11 Declares Prussian Autocracy and Oppression Must Be Done Away With. CEMANBS FULL REPARATION No Diaire to Interfere With Internal Affair of Central Nations, but Peace Cannot Be Made With Germany's Present Rulers Declaration of War on Austria-Hungary. Washington, Dec. 4. President Wil ton In his message to congress today declared emphatically for a peace bns d on generosity and justice after Ger man autocracy "shall first be shown the utter futility of Its claims to power or leadership In the modern world." The message follows: "Gentlemen of the Congress Eight months have elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of Immense and grave significance for us. I shall undertake te detail or even to summarize these events. The prac tical particulars of the part we have played In them will be laid before you in the reports of the executive depart ments. I shall discuss only our pres ent outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties, and the Immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always in view. "I shall not go back to debate the causes of the war. The intolerable wrongs done and planned against us by the sinister musters of Germany bave long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true Amer ican to need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny our objec tives and the measures by which we mean to attain them ; for the purpose of discussion here in this place Is ac tion, and our action must move trnlght towards definite ends. Must Win the War. "Our object Is, of course, to win the war; and we shall not slacken or suf fer ourselves to be diverted until It Is won. But It is worth while asking and answering the question: When shall we consider the war won? "From one point of view It Is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the Amer ican people know what the war Is about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose in it As a nation we are united in spirit and intention. pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dis sent who does not? I hear the criti clsra and the clamour of the noisy, thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there fling them selves in Impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the tw tion. I hear men debate peace who understand neither Its nature nor the way in which we obtain it with uplift ed eyes and unbroken spirits. But I known that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten. No Peace by Compromise. "But from another point of view I believe that It is necessary to say plainly what we here at the seat of ac tion consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play In the set tlement of Its searching Issues'. "We are the spokesmen of the Amer ican people, and they have a right to know whether their purpose is two. They desire peace by the overcoming of evil, by the defeat once for all of the sinister forces that Interrupt peace and render It impossible, and they wish to know how closely our thought rnns with theirs, and what ac tion we propose. They are impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of compromise deeply and indig nantly Impatient but they will tie equally Impatient with us 1$ we do not make It plain to them what our ob jectives are and what we are planning (or In seeking to make conquest of peace by arms. Menace Must Be Crushed. "I believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this Intolerable thing of which the masters of Germany have shown us the ugly face, this menace of com bined Intrigue and force which we now see so clearly as the German power, a Thing without conscience or honor or capacity for covenanted peace, must be crushed and, If It Is not utterly brought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly intercourse of the nations; and, second, when this Thing and its power are Indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss peace when the Geman people have spokesmen whose words we can be lieve and when those spokesmen are ready In the name of their people to accept the common Judgment of the nations as to what shall hence forth be the bases of law and of cov enant for the life of the world we shall be willing and glad to pay the fan price for peace, and pay It un grudgingly. We know what that price

The Walllngfords of the Orient who stuck their fingers In the golden pie of world trade at the beginning of the war are toppling from their speculating thrones.

It win be ruil, impartial jus tice Justice done at every point and to every nation that the finii scttle ir.nt must afreet, our enemies as well as our friends. Final and Convincing Lesson. "Tou catch with me, the voices of humanity that are in &.e air. They grow dally more audible, more articu late, more persuasive, and they come from the hearts of men everywhere. They Insist that the war shall not end In vindictive action of any kind; that no nation or people shall he robbed or punished because the Irresponsible rulers of a single country have them selves done deep and damnable wrong. It Is this thought that has been ex pressed In the formula 'No annexa tions, no contributions, no punitive In demnities.' Just because this crude formula expresses the Instinctive Judg ment as to right of plain men every where, It has been made diligent use of by the masters of German Intrigue to lead the people of Russia astray and the people of every country their agents could reach, in order that n premature pence might be brought about before autocracy has been tnught Its final and convincing lesson, and the people of the world put In control of their own destinies." Right as the Arbiter. "But the fact that a wrong use has been made of a Just Idea Is no reason why a right use should not be made of it. It ought to be brought titular the patronage of Its real friends. I,rr It he said again that autocracy must first be shown the utter futility of Its claims to power or leadership In the modern world. It Is Impossible to apply any standard of Justice so long ns such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the present masters of Germany command. Ti)t until this has been done 'can Right be set up as arbiter and peacemaker among the nations. But when that has been done as, God willing, it assuredly will be we shall at last be free to do an unprecedented thing, and this the time to avow our purpose to do it. We shall be free to base peace on generosity and Justice, to the exclusion of all selfish claims to advantage even on the part of the victors. To Win War Our Present Task. "Let there be no misunderstanding. Our present and Immediate task Is to win the war, and nothing shall turn us aside from It until It Is accomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of money, or of ma terials, Is being devoted nnd will con tinue to be devoted to that purpose until It Is achieved. Those who de sire to bring peace about before that purpose Is achieved I counsel to carry their advice elsewhere. We will not entertain it. We shall regard the war as won only when the German people say to us, through properly accredited representatives, that they are ready to agree to a settlement based upon Jus tice and the reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done. They have done a wrong to Belgium which must be repaired. They have established a power over other lands and people than their own over the great empire of Austria-Hungary, other hitherto free Balkan states, over Turkey, and within Asia which must be relinquished. Must End German Autocracy. "Germnny's success by skill, by In dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise, we did not grudge or oppose, but ad mired, rather. She had built up for herself a real empire of trade and In fluence, secured by the peace of the world. We were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture, science and commerce that were Involved for us in her success and stand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and the Initiative to surpass her. But at the moment when she had conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them away, to establish in their stead what the world will no longer permit to be established, military and political domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated. The peace we make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of Belgium and north ern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but It must also deliver the peoples of Austria Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans, and the peoples of Turkey, alike In Europe and in Asia, from the Impudent and alien dominion of the Prussian military and commercial autocracy. To Manage Their Own Affairs. "We owe It, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish In any way to Impair or to re-arrange the Austro Hungaiian empire. It Is no affair of ours what they do with their own life, either Industrially or politically. We do not purpose or desire to dictate to them In any way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left In their own hands, in all matters, great or small. We shall hope to secure for the peoples of the Balkan peninsula and for the people of the Turkish empire the right and opportunity to make their own lives safe; their own for tunes secure against oppression or In justice and free from the dictation of foreign courts or parties. 'And our attitude and purpose with regard to Germany herself are of a like kind. We Intend no wrong against the German empire; no Interference with her Internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other ab solutely unjustifiable, absolutely con trary to the principles we have pro fessed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a na tion. German People Deceived. "The people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now per mit to deceive them and to act as their masters that they are fighting for the very life and existence of their em pire; a war of desperate self-defense against deliberate aggression. Nothing could ' be more grossly or wantonly nered the cotton market. Until recent ly the Osaka operator held the em pire's cotton market In his hand. An other Osaka narlkln committed suicide when his war bubble burst, with the war boom of Japan past Its height Japan's trade returns for the open ing ten days of October were T52, 218,000, a decrease of 10 per tent over the previous ten-day period. The Im ports totaled Y28.513.000, a decrease of one-half of 1 per cent over the pre vious ten-day period, but an Increase over the tame period of last year. aise, and we must oj the of- ntoft openness and r.-ndor us to our real alms to convince them of its false ness. We arc In fact fighting for their emancipation from fear, along with our own from the fear as well as from the fact of unjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers after world empire. No one Is threaten ing the existence of or the indepeu dence or the peaceful entcrprse of th German empire. Not Again to Be Trusted.' "The worst that can happen to the German people la this, that If they should still, after the war is over, continue to be obligated to live under ambitious and Intriguing masters In terested to disturb the peace of the world, men or classes of men whom the other peoples of the world could not trust, It might be impossible to admit them to the partnership of nations which must henceforth guarantee the world's peace. That partnership must be a partnership of peoples, not a mere partnership of governments. It might be imposs'ble, also, in such untoward circumstances, to admit Germany to the free economic Intercourse which must Inevitably spring out of the other partnerships of a real peace. But there would be no aggression In that; and such a situation. Inevitable be cause of distrust, would In the very nature of things sooner or later cure Itself, by processes which would as suredly set in. Wrongs Must Be Righted. "The wrongs, the very deep wrongs, committed In this war will have to be righted. That of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the commission of similar wrongs against Germany and her allies. "The world will not permit the com mission of similar wrongs as a means of reparation and settlement. States men must by this time have learned that the opinion of the world Is every where wide awake and fully compre hends the Issues Involved. No repre sentative of any self-governed nation will dnre disregard It by attempting any such covenants of selfishness and compromise as were entered into at the congress of Vienna. The thought, of the plain people here and everywhere throughout the world, the people wh enjoy no privilege and have very sim ple and unsophisticated standards of right and wrong, Is the air all govern ments must henceforth breathe if they would live. It is in the full disclos ing light of that thought that all poli cies must be conceived and executed in this mid-day hour of the world's life. People Have No Say. "German rulers have been able to up set the peace of the world only because the German people were not suffered under their tutelage to share the com radeship of the other peoples of the world either in thought or in purpose. They were allowed to have no opinion of their own which might be set up as a rule of conduct for those who exer cised authority over them. But the congress that concludes this war will feel the full strength of the tides that run now In the hearts and consciences of freedom everywhere. Its conclu sions will run with these tides. "All these things have been true from the very beginning of this stu pendous war; and I cannot help think ing that if they had been made plain at the very outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Russian people might have been once for all enlisted on the side of the allies, suspicion and distrust swept away, and a real and lasting union of purpose effected. Had they believed these things at the very moment of their revolution and had they been confirmed In that belief since, the sad reverses which have re cently marked the progress of their affairs towards an ordered and stable government of freemen might have been avoided. "The Russian people have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people In the dark, and the poison has been ad ministered by the very same hands. The only possible antidote is the truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly or too often. Freedom of the Seas. "From every point of view, there fore, it has seemed to be my duty to speak these declarations of purpose, to add these specific Interpretations to what I took the liberty of saying to the sennte in January. Our entrance Into the war has not altered our attitude towards the settlement that must come when It Is over.' When I said In Janu ary that the nations of thw world were entitled not only to free pathways up on the sea but also to assured and un molested access to those' pathways I was thinking, and I am thinking now, not of the smaller and weaker nations alone, which need our countenance and support, but also of the great and pow erful nations, and of our present ene mies as well as our present associates In the war. I was thinking, and am thinking now, of Austria herself, among the rest, as well as of Serbia and of Holand. Justice and equality of rights can be had only at a great price. We are seeking permanent, not temporary, foundations for the peace of the world and must seek this can didly and fearlessly. As always, the right will prove to be expedient. Declare War on Austria. "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and just to Its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all Impediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unit "One very embarrassing obstacle that stands In our way is that we are at war with Germany but not with her allies. I, therefore, very earnestly rec ommend that the congress immediately declare the United States in a state of 

GIRL RAISES CORN She Gets 1,500 Bushels From a Tract of Fifty Acres. Kansas women can till the soil the same as those of France, If necessity re quires. This is proved In the case of Miss Lucy McGinty of Belpre, who has raised fifty acres of corn that will make thirty bushels to the acre, and has sown 120 acres of wheat for 1918. Mrs. Mary A. McGinty is a widow with four children. Miss Lucy Is twen ty, tlwre Is one older sister, a younger war witn AnsrrtvHnngarj. Does it !eeni Minnie to you that this should be the conclusion of the argument 1 have Just addressed to you? It Is not. It Is in fact the InevltuMr logic of what I have said. Austria-Hungary U for tli time being not her ov i mis tress, but simply the vassal of the German government. We must face the facts as they are ana act upon them without sentiment in this stern business. The government of Austria Hungary Is not acting upon Its own Initiative or In response to the 1shes and feelings of its own people, but as the Instrument of nnother nation. We must meet Its force with our own and regard the central powers as but one. The war can be successfully conducted In no other way. As to Turkey and Bulgaria. "The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They also are the tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand In the direct path of our necessary action. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but It seems to me that we should go only where Immediate and practical considerations land us and not heed any others. "The financial and military meas ures which must be adopted will sug gest themselves as the war and Its un dertakings develop, but I will take the liberty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seem to me to be needed for the support of the war and for the release of our whole force and energy. "It will be necessary to extend in certain particulars the legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemies; nnd also necessary, I be lieve, to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and departure of all persons Into and from the United States. "Legislation should be enacted de fining as a criminal offense every willful violation of the presidential proclama tions relating to alien enemies promul gated under section 4067 of the Re vised Statutes nnd providing appropri ate punishments; and women as well as men, should be Included under the terms of the acts placing restraints upon nllen enemies. It is likely that :is time goes on many alien enemies will be willing to be fed and housed at the expense of the government In the detention camps, and It would be the purpose of legislation I have sug gested to confine offenders among them In penitentiaries and other sim ilar Institutions where they could be mnde to work as other criminals do. Go Further In Fixing Prices. "Recent experience has convinced me that the congress must go further In authorizing the government to set limits to prices. The law of supply and demand, I am sorry t say, has been replaced by the law of unrestrain ed selfishness. While we have elim inated profiteering In several branches of industry, it still runs impudently rampant In others. The farmers, for example, complain with a great deal of Justice, that while the regulation of food prices restricts their incomes, no restraints are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must them selves purchase, and similar iniquities obtain on all sides. "It Is Imperatively necessary that the consideration of the full use of the water power of the country and also the consideration of the systematic and yet economical development of such of the natural resources of the country as are still under the control of the federal government should be Immediately resumed and affirmatively and constructively dealt with at the earliest possible moment. The press ing need of such legislation Is daily be coming more obvious. A Word to the Lawmakers. "The legislation proposed at the last session with regard to regulated com binations among our exporters, In or der to provide for our foreign trade a more effective organization and meth od of co-operation, ought by all means to be completed at this session. "And I beg that the members of the house of representatives will permit me to express the opinion that It will be impossible to deal in any but a very wasteful and extravagant fashion with the enormous appropriations of the public moneys which must continue to be made, if the wnr is to be properly sustained, unless the house will con sent to return to Its former practice of initiating and preparing all appro priation bills through a single commit tee, In order that responsibility may be centered, expenditures standardized and made uniform and waste and du plication as much as possible avoided. "Additional legislation may also be come necessary before the present con gress again adjourns In order to effect the most efficient co-ordination and op eration of the railway nnd other trans portation systems of the country; but to that I shall. If circumstances should demand, call the attention of the con gress upon another occasion. Concentrate on Winning War. "If I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for the more effective conduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the omission. What I am perfectly clear about is that in the present session of the congress our whole attention and energy should be concentrated on the vigorous, rapid and successful prosecution of the great task of winning the war. "We can do this with all the greater zeal and enthusiasm because we know that for us this as a war of high prin ciple, debased by no selfish ambition of conquest or spoliation; because we know, and all the world knows, that we have been forced into It to save the very Institutions we live under from corruption and destruction. The pur poses of the central powers strike straight at the very heart of every thing we believe In; their methods of warfare outrage every principle of hu- slster and a young brother. The big crops of the farm were managed by Miss McGinty, who had only the as sistance of her brother and sisters and a nephew, who helped on the listing, and an uncle, who adjusted her ma chinery at odd times. To ruise the big corn crop Miss Mc Ginty had to work night and day. Dur ing the summer months flies were so bad she could not work during the duy tlme, so she worked nights, had her sisters bring her midnight meals and got her crops cultivated. She plowed mnniry and of irtghriy Honor; thett Intrigue has corrupted the very thought nnd spirit of many of our people; Ihei.- sinister and secret diplo macy bus sought to take our very ter ritory away from us and disrupt the union of the states. Our safe'' would be at an end. our honor forever sullied and brought lnt contempt were we to permit their triumph. They are strik ing at the very existence of democracy and liberty. Cause Is Just and Holy. "It Is because It Is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose, in which all the free peoples of the world are banded together for the vindication of right, a war for the preservation of our nation, nnd of all that It has held dear of principle and of purpose, that we felt ourselves doubly constrained to purpose for Its outcome only that which Is righteous and of Irreproach able Intention, for our foes as we" as for our friends. The cause being just and holy, the settlement must be of like motive nnd quality. For this we can fight, but for nothing less noble or less worthy of our traditions. For this cause we entered the war and for this cause will we battle until the last gun Is fired. "I have spoken plainly, because this seems to me the time when it Ir most necessary to speak plainly. In order that all the world may know that even In the heat and ardor of the struggle and when our whole thought Is o' carrying the war through to its cmi we have not forgotten any Ideal o; principle for which the name of Amei lea has been held in honor among the nations and for which It has been our glory to contend In the great genera tions that went before ns. A supreme moment, of history has come. The eyes of the people have been opened, and they see. The hand of God Is laid upon the nations. He will show them favor, I devoutly believe, only if they rise to the clear heights of his own justice and mercy." 

PARSIMONY IS NOT ECONOMY Many People Able to Buy What They Want Use Situation as Excuse for Going Without. It Is a curious and mortifying con dition of the prevailing "economy" that many people abundantly able to buy what they want use the situation as an excuse for going without. What does this profit them? It merely makes them richer at a time when the talk Is of being poorer, says the Hartford Conrant. Food Is one thing and clothes and other articles that shoppers buy are In i distinctly other class. When Smith cut down the sugar, there Is more sugar for Jones, and the supply of sugar Is limited. But when Mrs. Smith goes without a clonk for which she can easily pay and which she expected to buy this season, she Is not helping Mrs. Jones to get It; she Is simply misering along In her own way, and to her small ability driv ing poor people out of work nnd dis couraging merchants whose capital Is Invested. This Isn't economy. It is par simony. If everybody should quit making purchases, what would become of manufacturers or dealers and of the larger number of workers? It Is a good time to keep a level head. Many who watch the tendency of business say frankly that people of limited means are less saving than' those who can well afford to get what thej want The Mystery Explained. Clifton Hess, an employee of tht Pennsylvania railroad at Shelbyville, Ind., relates the Indianapolis News, looked out the window of the freight depot the other day and noticed a womnn. A half hour Inter he looked again and still saw the woman. She had changed her position only slightly, moving down the railroad track a few feet. She seemed to be strolling leis urely along, covering about a foot a minute. Curious to determine the reason for her actions, Hess walked outside to get a better view. Then It was all explained. The woman had a big Rhode Island Red rooster with a string tied to his leg. There had evidently been a leaky car of wheat along the railroad, nnd the rooster, ob livious to all else, was calmly filling his crnw while the woman kept up with the procession. Later on during the day the good news must have spread, for there ap peared on the scene several other chickens with owners attached to them by strings. As the ground be came clean the procession slowly moved from view. Cantonment It Is said that the reason why svr eral high officials of the United States government continue to pronounce It "cantone-ment" Is because they got started that way and ore now unable to stop. The president, however, says "can-t'n-m'nt," with the accent on the first syllable. It is worthy of men tion that Professor Hunt of Princeton puts it "con-tonn-ment," with the ac cent on the second syllable, thus dis agreeing with a former head of that Institution, and that while the presi dent has the latest revisions of the Century, Webster's, Worcester's, and the Standard dictionaries on his side. Doctor Hunt is hacked by Sir James A. M. Murray's new English and Stor month's dictionaries. It is estimated that 50 per cent of the United States army and government officials Insist on "can-tone-mcnt." The other 50 per cent.

Burrell of Cleveland, and put him in one of the major posts in the vast war machine that has been constructed to crush Prussian militarism. Burrell has been made director of gas warfare for the army and navy, and his particular task is that of matching his skill against the in genuity of German chemists. In manu facturing death dealing devices. Burrell was born and reared In Cleveland. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Burrell. reside at 10010 Somer set avenue N. E. lie attended Broadway school and was graduated from South High school and Ohio State university. Most of his years since completing his education have been spent In chem ical laboratories. Many of his experi ments proved useful to the Newburg steel mills. Burrell made a study of mine gases during his emplpyment with the bu reau of mines at Pittsburg. Under his guidance, federal employes fitted out a mine rescue car that has been adopted by several governments. He participated in thrilling rescues of entombed miners, and his name Is a familiar one in coal mining circles It was at his suggestion that theL canary bird was first used to ascer tain whether men could work in the gas found in certain mines. With a bird cage strapped to the shoulder of the leader of a party of explorers, eyes were kept fastened on the little singer during the under ground voyage, and if the bird col lapsed or showed signs of weakening, a hasty ascent was made and the mine gas labeled poisonous. Increases Coal Valuation. Ohio's tax commission announced addition of more than $8,000,000 to the tax values of separately owned coal (that is, coal owned separately from the surface), in 14 counties of the state. The commi.ishvn declared co nparl- sons made with the tax valuations of other property showed the coal to be listed at much less than its true value in money, and that the value was In creased 33 per cent to 100 per cent per values of this class of property, as would be nearer uniform in value with other property. The increase in the tax value of the separately owned coal lands." says a statement issued by the com mission, "was ordered after the com mission had carefully considered the values of this class of property, as shown by the abstracts filed by the county auditors. 'The abstracts filed with the com mission show the separate values of the lands, buildings, separately owned coal, oil and mineral lands. In addi tion, the abstracts show that the values of coal lands were practically the same as in 1910, although a few of the counties had readjusted the values in 1914." Warns of Food Enemies.

PEOPLE BACK HOME 10 Chillicothe. The people of Ohio have had brought home to them an other example of the real personal service Maj. Gen. Edwin F. Glenn has been rendering the soldiers of the Eighty-third division and all other Ohio military units and their families. Industrial Commission Reports. Ohio's industrial commission, in its annual report Just submitted, pro poses to carry further the work of censoring moving pictures, asking that the general assembly in its next session provide for inspectors to visit theaters to watch for violations of the law. At present the law provides for a board of three censors to pass on films to be exhibited. The industrial commission urges that a need exists for inspectors to see that the law. as interpreted by the censors, is carried out. The commission report has other outstanding features, among them the following: In connection with the child labor laws, the commission Mates it la ex periencing "considerable difficulty in securing the proper co-operation from the school authorities, especially in the matter of issuing age and school ing certificates." The report declares some school officials seem not to be in sympathy with the law, and actu ally "encourage disrespect" for the law by "lax and careless methods" in making out certificates. The commission holds that the courts have been remitting too many lines in cases of violation of the child and female labor laws, declaring more than 50 per cent of the fines imposed in the fiscal year ended June 30. 1917, which is the period covered by the re port, were remitted. The commission lays stress on the present particular importance of the work of the division of mediation and arbitration, pledging that in this time of national emergency, the division feels it a special duty to avert indus trial difficulties and industrial loss in Ohio. The statistics of the report show abnormal industrial activities in the state because of the war. Premiums paid into the state insur ance fund exceeded the amount paid . in the fiscal year of 1916 by 74.8 per cent. Disbursements for workmen's compensation and medical, nursing and hospital services, increased 57.8 per cent.
