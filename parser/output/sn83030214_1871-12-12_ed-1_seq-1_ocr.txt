Tho Prince of Wale?, according I?) an official dis? patch just received from Sandringham, passed a very restless night. There are no signs of improvement in his condi? tion, and death ia imminent al any time daring to? day from suffocating attacks. His strength ia diminishing, and what sleep ho has is followed by restlessness and inquiotnde. The chest symptoms are bad. The Princess Alexandra is greatly exhausted. Hie Princess Royal, Victoria, wife of the Crown Trinco of Germany, is liourly expected at Sandringham. The groom of the Prince is somewhat worse, and is threatened with inflammation of the lunga. Hie excitement in London and in the Provinces is greater than during the Crimean war. WASHINGTON. THE EXPECTED CAB?NET CHANGES. MR. AKLHMAN'rt REMOVAL TO TAU PLACE IM MI-'.DIATELY ? UONTEMI'L TED RETIKEMENT OF SECRETARY ROBKSON. IUT TKLBORAPH TO TUB TRIBL'Nh-l Washington. Dec. 11.?Mattera have reached tho point, now, where lhere can no longer bo a shadow of doubt that Mr. Akerman will at once retire from the Attorney-Generalship, and be succeeded by ex Senator Williams of Oregon. This chango was sub? stantially decided upon several days ago, but has been withheld for certain reasons, which make a longer delay unnecessary. The retiring Attorney-General will be transferred to other fields, if bo prefers te remain in an official station: if not, it is thought that he will settle here as an attorney before tho higher courts. It was re? ported that Mr. Akerman could have received any foreign appointment that was vacant, or likely to be so. but bis friends concluded that such a position would not be to his taste. It therefore seems prob? able that be will bo nilen d a legal position for life in one of the I'd i ted States Courte for one of tbe Southern States. Tam report that Reerctnrv Ifobesnn will soon retire fruin tho Navy Department (inda many believers. It seems certain that lie will be married to the brilliant and accomplished Mrs. Aulick, before the holidays, and many well-informed persons declare that it is his in tent inn to go abroad iu sonio ministerial capacity fut soon as that event occurs. AN ILL-ADVISED COMPLIMENT. Fran 77. r Aiming Mall If our nriviciw from Washington are correct ?and we feel certain that they are?many or the karn. ulm n who signed ? request to Sir. Pish to remain li ofllce aie already aware of the fact that they corn? il tt?td a mlitnlte. Their action was unprece? dented, and calculated to embarrass both the Presi? d? nt mid the Secretary, neither of whom can now he us free to follow his own Inclinations as before. In many casca the signatures of Senators were given under a misapprehension. We do not mean to say thev were deceived, hut they did' not understand fully the state of affairs which they good-naturedly sought to settle by outside und well-meant Interference. Of course it Is evident that the denatures of Senators to a virtual vote of conlMence in the Secretary has no nu. li st eil! flounce as though the same result had been ac? complished in executive session or in party raueus, and stier full dhteusslon. Rut no Senator would think of b ringing so delicate a suhjoct oefure the Keimte or a cau? cas. Yet one Senator after another Individually has committed himself to a paper that has the same purpose lu view. Ah almost all the Republican and niauy of the Democratic Seuatoi s ivre friendly to Secretary Pish, few would care to refuse to sign such a paper, and thus ap? pear to be in any degree hostile. Business men of prominence are thus every day committed to men and measures whose unqualified support they would not Jointly have given after full discussion. We believe that the Pr?sidant Is entitled to the most ample freedom of choice as to his coufldeutlsl Cabinet counselors. Of two men who arc equally hi/nest, capable, and patriotic, he ma^ prefer ono to the other for a Cal met officer because he uses nil rather than black pepper, if he so chooses. 80 long as ho selects a niau who is mu xc??ptiunable and fully qualified he is en? titled to a huge discretion ?uni the B,mite is bound to respect It. If the President should at this Juncture pre f r to Mr. Fish a ?secretary more lu accordance with his own views on certain growing International questions, it would bo unwise for the Senate to put any obstacles in the way of a chungo. It is. also, though undoubtedly with ii? such intention?unbind to both the President nnd Mr. Pish to prevent such a change from taking placo with the utmost good feeling und highest regard on both ltira. The former has the greatest esteem for and confi? dence lu the latter, if testimony from all woll-luformcd quarter* eau lie depended upon. Rut it is universally acknowledged that Mr. Fish has subordinated ull other questions to those growing out of the Alabama claims. That chapter lu our diplomacy is now virtually ulosoil. and the Secretary of Htatc must meut such issues as are now presented by Bnalu In a far ililli m nt manner from that In which Mr. Fish has treated them. To ask him to mar his brilliant record by 1 1 1 tinning in nilli e when he must subordinate his own Mews or come Into collision with nubile sentiment and With UM Pi'isitleut, Is to compliment bim lu a UlOet iiou.i'ful manner, so far as results are conceruod. 

CVRRENT TOPICS AT THE CAPITAL. OFFICIAL ADVICES CONCERNING THE HAVANA MURDERS?THE PROPOSED ABOLITION OP THE REVENUE BUREAU?DOINGS OF THE COM? MITTEE.?. I HI TELEUHATH TO TI1K TRiniNE.I Wasuixotox, Monday, Dee. 11,1871. Tlie Secretary of State baa received advices from Havana which place the action of the Spanish Govern? ment lu executing the students at Havana recently in a still more offensive, and Inexcusable light Gen. fiauks, Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, has been advised respecting these particulars. His Com? mittee, however, will not take any action In reference to Cuban affairs until after tho holidays. In the mean time the President will have In readiness for transmission to the Committee a report setting forth all the facts la con? nection with these matters which bare como Into th? possession of our Government. The proposition of Mr. Sumner to abolish the Internal He venue. Bureau calls to mind tho great efforts that were made only two years ago to Induce Congress to convert the Bureau Into a permanent department of the Gov? ernment, with a chief who shonld be a Cabinet oillcer. At that timo the .President favored the plan, and It wai pushed In tbe House with all the power offGeti. Hchenck and the Committee of Ways and Means to back It It was finally beaten by a bare majority of three. Now it is seriously believed by many that the time Is close at hand when the Burean can be entirely done away with, as afhnneceasary por? tion of the governmental machine -, and It la doubtful if a Ml) to make k1 a {Department, or even give It perma? nency as a Bureau, could get three votes In either House. None of the Senate Committee? have |yet held meet? ings, ami senators generally manifest a disposition to allow .the business referred to them to lie upon tbrlr table* until after the holidays. About the only Com? mittees, which form exceptions to this rule, are the Finance and Kn-Klux Committees. The latter hold? Its tlrst meeting, since tho reorganization of the Senate, to? morrow. The Military' Committee has had referred to It very little business of importance this session. Mr. W11 sou, luaVhairiuau, li preparing a bill, In which ho pro? pon h to curry out the recommendatlona made hythe President lu his message, but will not complete ItforsevenUday*.

In any way affecting our f?Ma*?M|rn ?crviee and ?tending. Tho Committee will meet on Thursday to consider Um bill ?lo oarry out the Treaty of Washington and other business before it The bill presented by lieu. Bank?, to-day, call? for an appropriation of fJM.OOO to ray the ?hare cf our Government In ilefraj I ng the ex? penses of the General -Conference, and tjw.ooo for the Mixed Commission now sitting here. The two Texas contested election cases were dl.-cusscil In the House Committee of Elections today, bat no con* closiou wu reached. 'These eases present some feature? entirely new in the history of contested elections. Ia the ?*a*e of Whitmore, Republican, against Hcrndon, Democrat, the latter holds the certificate, bul a question arise? as to whether the document Is valid. It is In reg? alar form, but appended to It is a tabular statement of the vote in the different counties in the district, and a remark by the Governor that Whitmore was legally elected, by reason of violence and Intimidation practiced In certain counties In the lntere?t of Horndon. The counties named, however, if excluded, would ?till leave Hcrndon a majority. The actual vote ?how? a majority for Horndon of 4,300, while Whitmore claims a lawful majority of al-out 5,000. The ease of Chiding?, Dcin<T crat. against C lar*. Republican, Is quite dur?rent. Clark hold? the certificate, to which i? attached a tabular state? ment, a? in the other case, by which it appe ira that Old din?**? had about 1,100 majority. Tb? Govi r mr deduct? from Gld lings'? vote tho vote of counties where he says there was sufficient violence to invalidate the i?oll, and flirures np a majority for Clark of 1,325. Thus it appears that in one case the Governor gave the certificate to the man who got the most votos, but who, he say?, was not lawfully elected, and In the other ease he gave the ecr titk-ato to the candidate who got the lead votes, but who be claims is nevertheless legally elected. Tho President said today that he hoped Congress would ai?oll?h the income tax before adjourning for the holiday recess. Ho soems to think that If nothing is done until Congress reassembles in January, a bill to abolish the tax may not be got through both Houses in time ?to stop the collection for tho present year, which will be ma?le In March, If the law is left unchanged. The Ways and Means Committee have taken no action yet upon the subject. The Committe? is divided In opinion as to tho wisdom of the repeal. Borne of the members favor the further oxteuslon of the law, and its continu? ance a? long as any internal tax?? are collected, but a majority will, it Is believed, favor immediate re peni. Mr. ?Christian Piper of St. Iaouis, Mo., a member of the National Tobacco Association, remains here, and will have a hearing before the Committee of Ways and Means in a day or two. He goes before this Committee with tho proposition to piare euch separate plug of tobacco in a wrapper and stamp it. His idea seems to have official favor In the Internal Revenue Burean, and it ts con? tended that very much of the tobacco sold out of stamped lMixes was not in the boxes when ?tamped, and that the consumer thereby pays the dealer a tax which should be paid to the Government. ft: FX

He pro re, ded to detail his analysts and test* for ?menle lu the material which had been left after the ?eau ch for strych? nia. The result WiVi a brownish precipitate, a portion of ?* hlcii he tenti-d with aqua ammonia, which satisfied him that no urseule was present. He then proceeded to ex? amine the imrtlnn of the material which had not been used in the test for arsenic ; the result led him to suspct the presence of antimony ; the test tor antimony pro? duced suth results that be could not entertain a doubt of its presenco ; he made no test* to ascertain what particu? lar compound antimony was present ; the only certainty wa? the atetan*? of un antimonial element, containing that parn? ular oidiuary article of commerce known u? tartar emetic. on the witness being a*>ked what quantity of tartar emetic was coutalned in this sulphide of antimony, he said, that to bis miud, tho quauttty v. as not so Impor? tant n* the character ; he never attached Importance a? to how much ??olson was found lu the stomach, ex? cept lu cases where It was found lu very small quanti? ties, which might accidentally get into the stomach, when its minuteness would explain its accidental pres euca* ; he took no pains to determine the quantity pres? ent, regarding it unimportant, and was proceeding to give his reason why he so regarded It, when tho witness wa? ?topped bv the Court. Ile then said the quantity could not have been less than 70 grains: If you call the article " tartar emetic," there were fully 'JO grain? or mo?' ; the ten grains of sul? phide of antimony prissent would make 20 grains of tar tax emetic ; tartar emetic, as such In substance, wa? never found in the stomach; the only evidence ..f the presence of tartar emetic was the evidence of some anti? monial clement ; this is not peculiar to antimonv, but common to all potions taken in the stomach; he bawd his idea of the quantity or wel-'ht of the tartar emetic found on observation, and his knowledge of the quantity contained in a ?riven weight of sulphide of antimony. WitiifN* was next examined concerning the sediment found tn the tumbler at Mrs. Wharton'?. A tumbler cou* tabling a sediment waa placed in his hands bv Dr. Chew. ?\ iiirh lie tested for tartar emetic; verified his tests, and found not less than 10 grains of tartar emetic In the ne ai? ment; he thinks the quantity was IJ grains; it was found not less than lo-, the proc?s? of testing wa* explained.

HOW THEY ARE 8WIJSDLHD IN PORT. A SY8TKM OF ROBBERY BY SHIPPINO AGENTS AND BOARDINO-IIOC6E KEP.I'KrS?EMIGRANT ROB? BERS OUTDONE ?THE MERCHANT MARINE DEMORALIZED?8TATE LAWS DISREGAHDED? A OENERAL SHIPPING AiT DEMANDED?A CHAPTER FOR CONGRESSMEN. There is pending before the Committee on Commerce, in Congress, having been earned over from last session, an act entitled the " Shipping Commission sloners' bill," to which It Is emineatly desirable, In the Interest? of commerce, that attention should at one? be directed. It was unantuoiuly approved by the former Committee en Commerce, and would have been favor? ohlv reported had It been reached. It win he brought' up before the Bouse at sn early day, and Immediate action upon it asked by the merchants who suffer in consequence of the failure to pass it. It Is intended and la calculated to benefit our merchant marine service by raising the standard of its ptrtonnel. It will take out of the bauds of the lowest class of keepers of sailor's boarding-houses and shipping agent? the power to detain vessels in port forwent of tho crews which ouly they now furnish, and place the duty of supplying crews and licensing sailors under the direc? tion of Government Commissioners. It will no longer leave the venue is of merchants at the mercy of the muti? nous crews which tites? ?hipping agent? place upon them at their pleasure ; and it will relievo seamen of the ear ruptlng Influences ashore which demoralise and niako ninny of them worthless on shipboard. While tho wrongs inflicted upon the gTeat shipping interesta of New-York by the Health Ofllcer, th? Pur? Wardens, and tbe Harbor Masters have engaged tbe attention of The Tbii.ixe for some time past, these outrages upon sailor? have not been forgotten. The Injuries inflicted upon t.ipltal bv public officials are not more heinous than the robbery of a frloudles? sailor, and tho blame in both coses rest? with the Government ami the ship-owners. A concerted action of the latter, with the support of projier leclslatlon at Washington, would correct niauy of the evils which to-day harrass our mercantile marine. The present State statute for thrs protection of seamen is practically a dead letter, as all find who have recourse to It for Justice. The bet-1 legal ability in the city, sustained by the Keameu's Friend Society, has utterly failed to obtain, under this law, the conviction of the most flagrant o (lenders. The sailor is generally deprived of the choice el a hoardlng-bonse by the runner? who, In gangs, board tho vessels In tho bay, and, with that rivalry which Is supposed to characterise the Industrious agents " who knock their men down and engage them before they como to their senses," secure every man, with or with? out his consent. Almost invariably tho sailor loses all toe money received for the voyage through the robbery of tho low boarding-house hirelings; he then loses hil advance mouey, which is swallowed up in the charges for services never rendered, and Anally he loses the righi to select hi? next voyage, for the boarding-house-keep?, acting no a shipping-agent, sends him wherever he I pleases. sailor noARDrxo-norsFs. The low and boarding-houses to be found along the streets in the vicinity of the North ami Host Rivers, unin? viting as t hey are, present many attractions tor the sailor after a long cruise and the dreary life ou shlpbo ird. His tlrst feeling of freedom from the confinement of lils floating pi ??on makes him rash In tbe selection of lodgings, so that the glittering sign-board and the red-curt lined win? dows of tho combined tap-room and parlor, eeelly entl? o lilio. There Is a show of hospitality, a surfa-v* uppear ance of comfort, an air of freedom about the place, which promise present gratification. Although the houses on which notices are displayed that sailors are entertained therein are generally not the cleanest or the most pieas uiitlv located, this fact appear? of small mo? ment to one who has just finished a loas voyage. If the Bailor endured the damp and smoke ni the forecastle tor six months, surely ho .Is not likely to lind fault with what ia to lie his abode for as many days. If twenty meu and boys could ooard and lodge In the contlned plate he has Just quitted, be will not gruiubhi upon being put into the room containing six double -lied,-, winch at night is pointed out to hyi. For Ki to X) pet week he will have three regular meals each dav, ami ut : iiy hour he may "rouse hi? spirits up by pouring ?pirita down," an inducement which has very great ?neitht. The appearance of all the low sailor boarding houses, externally and Internally, is much the same, and a gen? eral picture will serve for each Individual case. The ex? terior of the building Is generally painted a dull leal color, or a dlrt.1%green?lu one iustsuce blue - -and It mut? ter? little how high tbe house may he. there are aJwuye found the same small windows with tlie usual flimsy enr tiiin? flapping within.
