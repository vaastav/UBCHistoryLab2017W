OF THE Now that it is admitted that the Re publicans are determined to pass the Force bill, the question arises: Why ? On the day after the election, the Chron icle pointed out the dilemma which con fronted the Republican party. On the oue hand they saw that the Force bill had been repudiated throughout the whole country, and J hat it wr.s danger ous to further irriKto ihu ptoplo by the kind cf leglslati :i ugaiass which they had protested. On the other hand, could they hope to control the govern ment without help from the South? Many of the Northern States are lost. If the Republicans, we argued, believe thatlllinois.New York, Indiana and other States are lost beyond remedy they will pass the Force bill; if they believe that it is a temporary repulse, they will not feel it necessary to pass the Force bill. The action of the Senate shows that the Republicans re gard their losses in the North as either permanent or almost so, and they are seeking to get additional strength in the South. If so, tbe:r plans will fail. The Force bill is loaded, and those who fire it will have cause to say : "Some gnns there are that so contrive it, To miss their game whate'er they aim at, -And whether ctiargtfd for duck or plover, Fly back and kick their owner over," But it is seriously argued by the able and astute National Democrat that the Republicans do n t desire to pass the Forco bill in order to gain strength in the South, or secure to the negroes in the far South the "fair ballot" they prate about so Icudly. The Republican leaders know perfectly well, says the Democrat, that if such a law could be passed it c mid not bo enforced. The Democrat's posi tion is striking, and is worthy of con sideration. Its position is: But it could be used to keep up sectional bitterness and and to fool the negro voters of the Northern States into the belief that ultimately in some States of the Union South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana the spectacle might b9 again presented of negroes ruling white men. To keep the negro vote solid for the Republican party in the Northern States is the real problem of Lodge, to be used in pv ing pensions snail dq derived from a tax levied upon all in come which exceed $10,000. He has not yet peifected the details of his bill which, if passed, would have two good effects: 1. It would compel the very rich to contribute their just share to the bur dens of government. Many of them grow rich out of the jobs and trades in cident to the war, and because their in comes ara largely derived from non taxable bonds they escape taxation. An iucome of tax would make them pay in proportion to their wealth the only just system of taxation. 2. It would cause a more careful ex amination into the transactions of the pension bureau and the wealthy thinkers of the country would soon expose the schemes which are now allowed to b3 carried to completion through the greed of pension agents who are not exposed by timid Congressmen. Ia the last session of the House, Hon. Alfred Rowland, of North Carolina, in traduced a bill to pat a tax on incomes. He was on the right line. Year by year men of lame fortune have found new ways of escaping taxation, and if legis 1-Uors compel them them to pay their .hare of the burdens, there will have to ba newT methods adopted. The income tax is the best yet presented. Person- Maj. X T. Yaneey, jollier. Polk-A. B. Thompson, T.ilnn I IT. rv. a. " 1U .f ri. TTAama. Farmers, deme. Richmond- Jos.SPPfiiHr T Robeson--. J S.

It is very gratifying to us that the New York Herald took the same view of the President's Message that the State Chronicle tooK. we mate a lew ex tracts: From N. Y. Herald:! From State Chroni cle: Mr. Harrison's mes- The message is sage does not risej neither able, judic above the dull mo-iial nor statesman- notonvof platitude, like, but is a corn- It lacks the merit of either rhetoric or logic, will be read from courtesy, but without interest. As an exhibit of states manship it is a seri ous disappointment, tor it conveys an im pression tnat tne writer has no con victions or thioks it impolitic to express them. But Mr. Harrison in the latter part of his message shows himself to be the head of a party rath er than the Presi dent of a people. He reminda Congress that this is their short session and calls upon them to push certain purely partisan bills with vigor and celerity. The Reapportion ment and Force bills must receive imme diate attention. These are in the in terest of the party and should not be neglected. monplace, clear and plain presentation of matters or impor tance and a partisan plea for the acta or the Republican par ty. As we read every line from the begin ning, we hoped to see a cintillation of greatness s o m e where in the ponder ous document, and hoped that in some particular he would rise above the nar rowness and section alism of his party and show himself worthy to be Presi dent of the whole people. But we were not to be rewarded by our Bearch. Ihe further we read, the greater was our dis appointment. His climax is a specious, unfair, sectional and partisan argument for the passage of the Force bill. Of this number there are five lawyers in the Senate and eleven in the House. We shall make corrections from time to time, and will thank otlf friends to help us perfect this list.
