We fail to observe the least connection in the President's message to Congress with tho declarations in the Democratic lattorm of 1912.

The Presi dent has chosen "preparedness" for his key note, but deeper than this, in significance, is the great problem of national taxation. Thjs problem cannot be lost sight of through ttie ciruamioction with which it has hern sor rounded. The President's view of pre pa redness is merely a reiteration of the views and opinions ex pressed by bini months ago. Tlie ro affrtnation of the Monroe Doc trine is masutrf ul lu its way, but nothing short of what would Its expected of any President, Dem ocratic or Kepubllcta.
