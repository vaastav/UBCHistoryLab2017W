THE MEMPHIS DAILY APPEAL THTJR8DAY, DECEMBER 7, 1871. MEMPHIS APPEAL OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE CITY. THURSDAY MORNING, : : DEC. 7, 1871. JOHN JOHNSON. RESPONSE OF MAYOR JQKNiON. HE ASSENTS TO THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE, AND ANNOUNCES HIM SELF A CANDIOATE FOR Rk-ELECTION. Editor Appeal In response to call which I find In the public press of the oily, signed by several thousand of my fellow cltizena, I hereby announoe myself a osn dldate lor re-election to the office of mayor. For the flattering terms in which the municipal government, ae adminis tered by me, have been commended, I feel indeed grateful. I have not been an aspirant 'for re-election; but feeling a deep interest in all that concerns the welfare of the city of Memphis, I can not assign any good reason for declining to accept an office in which it Is thought by so many of my fellow-citizens I may be o service to the public I hare tried to do the beet I oould 'for the city during the past two years, and should my admin istration be indorsed by my re-election, I can only promise to continue my efforts to place the city in a sound and healthy condition; to discharge the duties of the office, with an eye to the honest administration of every trust con fided to me, and with no Interest to serve which I shall not be ready to avow to this whole community. Hoping the peo ple of Memphis will for the future take an Intelligent and oontinous Interest in their municipal affaire, I subscribe my self, very respectfully, JOHN JOHNSON. THE ( OTTOS TAX. The New York (JomtnerdcU BulUtUL, referring to the suit before the United State supreme court, by which it is sought to recover from the government the sum of the unconstitutional cotton tax, says "that the planters, or the specu lators who have bought up these planters' receipts for the tax, have no more right to such restitution than have the holders of Confederate cotton bonds, payable "six months after the ratification of a treaty of peace with the United States." A tax upon production invariably falls upon consumption, and, whether it be just and legal or not, no restitution Is possible when the articles on which such taxes are levied and collected have passed into con sumption. Those who paid the tax in ques tion were those who bought for use or wear the fabrics made from the cotton on which the tax was collected, and to re fund to the planters the millions thus confiscated, would be to pay them a bounty to which they are in no respect entitled. We hope this silly business ot memorializing congress on this subject will be abandoned at onoe, and that the New Orleans chamber of oommeroe will devote lte attention to matters which promise more of benefit to the people ot the South. Whether just or not, the claim is one which cannot be allowed without greater injustice to tax -payers than that fat which it is proposed to make amends by the restitution oi the cotton tax to the planters." TOOF I BELIGIBI.E. Mr. John 8. Toof if a sbsreWder In the waterworks eompiny which leaped from the Pierian spring at which Sena tor Cttbbins quaffed deeply. The very moment that the waterworks company executes a contract with the city, Mr, Tool must retire from the field or aban don the waterworks. Section 17, page 8, of the city charter, provides that no one j shall be eligible to the mayor's office who, at the time of his election, or thereafter, becomes interested In any contract with the city. The Tammany convention must meet again, Mr. Tov Pa Interest In the waterworks la worth infinitely more than non-existent chanoes of suooeas as a candidate for the mayoralty. Menken Bros. 229 "AIN STREET- 229 W I8X1IN O TO CLOSE OUT 15X1 THE LAST DODGE OF PUBLIC PLTX- Retail Stock BY JANUARY 1st, It la ahown that after an appropriation bill passes the New York legislature the swindlers about Albany Insert in it para- sxaDha disposing of nice little sums. Forty thousand dollars were thus tam- manyized out of New York taxpayers at the last session of the legislature. The same dodge is probably practiced at Washington, and to prevent it in future, photographs of the appropriation bills will be taken before they are delivered to the public printers. A BIG JOB DEHOUKCED. The great scheme devised by a certain Eastern ring for the construction of a ship-canal from Lake Erie to Lake Cham plain, and so on to the Hudson river, has been scotched. A dispatch received from Buffalo yesterday says that at a full meet ing of the board of trade held Tuesday morning, the special committee to whom had been referred the surject of the pro posed commercial convention to be held The Knoxville Chronicle thinks that the new Issue of the Bank of Tennessee, kit which the courts may force the State to provide, will amount to five or ten mil lions. How much of forged paper of this bank, filled up from the genuine plates, Is in existence, no one can tell. The holders ot this bogus paper of the State are not interested in showing their hands. The less the supposed outstanding amount the greater the probability of the assumption of the debt by the State. Who can tell how much of this money was diffused over the South by Colonel Crawford, of Phila delphia? Great Bargains SILKS!

CANDIDATE FOB AT OK. It will be seen from the letter published in the Al'PXAL this morning that Mayor Johnson has yielded to the clamors of the people, and consents to the use of his name as a candidate for re-election to the office of mayor. This announcement should be the signal-gun for his friends to rally to his support. The movement which has placed Mayor Johnson before the public Is founded on principle, and not on clap-trap. Born ot a deep-seated determination to assert and maintain the true easenae of democracy the right of the people to govern themselves It has progressed thus far with a strong, swift, and steady current, resistless in its power, but without noise or bluster. Having quietly annouaoed their candidate and principles, the originators of the movement left thoughtful citi zens to quietly consider the is sues presented, and to discuss among themselves the merits of their cause, feeling assured that impartial reflection oould only impel honest taxpayers to loin In the movement to crush the foul band of harpies who would prey upon the people's substanoe. These agencies have been noiselessly at work, Influencing candid men to determine to take sides with the people against the ring; and any Intelligent observer must per ceive that the wave has steadily been gaining strength and momentum, ana must eventually engulf and sweep away all opposition, as a resistless tide car ried ofl the cities on the South American coast. Our candidate has been tried and found competent, honest and efficient. He la a man of known character for lodg ment, determination and impartiality, sod his dynasty cannot fall to prove a blessing to those over whom his authority la exercised. denounces the proposed Niagara ship canal as useless and unnecessary and if completed would not tend to lessen the coat of transportation or cheapen the price of Western products to Eastern consumers. It protests against a con gressional appropriation for the proposed object in the present State national finan ces and because it would add greatly to the commercial interest of a foreign na tion at the expense of our own. It de clares the Erie canal capable of filling all the present requirements of commerce, and that it is the cheapest, shortest, saf est and most direct outlet for Western commerce to the eastern States or Europe. It recommends the improving and cheap ening of transportation on the Erie canal so as to make it as near a free channel as the superintendence and repairs will ad mit. Viewing the purpose proposed fb antagonistic to the national and State Interests and savoring strongly of foreign influence, the board of trade respect sully decline sending delegates to the Detroit convention. -AND- the session must be brief, to have a wran gle between the two houses, a committee of conference, much juggling, and then octree the adjournment and sixty cents I

Grant's message, when read in the Senate and House, excited not the slight est applause. His sdherents were not well pleased, and Democrats oould hardly be expected to approve purposes emanat ing from one whose present "convictions and opinions" owe origin simply to a quarrel with Andrew Johnson. Bctlkr Is furious. Speaker Blaine, In organizing committees of the House, gave him the cut direct.

The convention held yesterday for the purpose of nominating a candidate for mayor was as sad and mournful as a cori ner's inquest. Colonel A. H. Douglass darted at those who signed the call upon Mayor Johnson with ail the venom of a pointer snapping at a blue botlle-fiy. He was the lightning orator of the show snd thought that we copied names to fill the call on Mayor Johnson from tombstones. This may be true, but it is certainly true that the voluble gentleman has dug his own political grave. Our friend J. H. U Tavior, cape red about the room like young goats over stable roofs. Van Anderson's voice waa for war, while he seemed inclined to do a distres sing amount oi latigue duty. H. 0 Young looked aa grave as a fat turkey on Chriat mas eve, and across his heavy brow was written, defeat. Altogether the con vention had the appearance c' men doomed to death, but ready to show an unappreclating world they could die game After some skirmishing John S. Toot waa elected sexton or In other words nomi nated as a candidate for mayor. The eclat with which his nomination was re ceive by a dosen boot-heels, reminded one of the wild, half pagan revel held by Byron and his friends over the funeral pyre of Shelley. Seriously we regret the nomination ot Mr. Toof, and hope for his own sake he will decline to accept it. John S. Toof is an hon ored citizen, highly respected for his personal virtues, and we trust he will not jeopardize his future promise, snd destroy his present usefulness aa a good citizen, by becoming the forlorn hope of a faction which has not the ghost of a chance lor success. Mr. Toof would make a worthy successor to Msyor Johnson, but there is nothing In his character which demands that he should supplant his equal in efficiency and in the affections of the people. Mr. Toof has all the elements of popularity; Is perhaps the atrongest man that oould have been brcught for ward ; but be and his friends will learn that personal popularity will not be suffi cient to move the people from their stern resolve to re-elect John Johnson mayor.

BOAD. Whatever others may have to say about 8 Anton, Chattanooga has no just ground of complaint. When he went there and began the construction of his road, two years ago, that place had only f 1,600,000 worth of property. The town had been in existence more than twenty years, and had only reached that point. It then had only one thousand voters. He has finished his r jad, incurring an enormous floating debt. But see what baa been done for Chatta nooga? It is now a city, having (3,600,000 worth of taxable property, and this year there were one thousand eight hundred and twenty voters! The Nashville and Chattanooga, the East Tennessee and Virginia, and Western and Atlantic roads did less for Chattanooga in fifteen years than Stanton's rosd in two years. Chat tanooga has reason to rejoice that Stanton discovered the spot. The indictment against Stanton at Montgomery was quashed a lew days ago, and he proposes to sell his road on condition that the floitlng debt sums due the people along the line shall be paid. He opposes any sale which will alone protect the State of Alabama as mortgagee. There is a ring, it is rumored, seeking to buy the State's mortgage with the purpose of providing oily for a few fortunate Individuals e. compassed by the circumference of this ring. J. H.

Jackson and Bolivar both wish a direct road to Memphis, because it would con nect them with the Mississippi river at the nearest and best point, and with the greet western railroads which will con verge at Memphis. The mode of adjust ing differences between Jackson snd Bol ivar la for one or both places to begin at once the construction of a road to Bomer villa. Whichever road reaches Fsjette county will be extended through that county to the Shelby line, and then It will be extended to Memphis. The extension of the road beyond Bolivar, or beyond Jackson, will be a matter for future con sideration. If Jackson and Madison coun ty will build the road to Hardeman, that county will build it to Fayette, and then there will be no difficulty la bringing it on to Memphis. Action la now needed. There has been discussion enourh. All mnst know that a road of this description, costing only twelve thousand dollars per mile, will pay dividends. It can easily be built if the people will take hold of It in earnest. We are satisfied that in less than two years it will be completed, and the task might as easily and more cheaply be accomplished within a twelvemonth. There has been talk enough. Action is needed. S.

Moreover, it will be shewn by the minori ty of the committee that since the close ot the war, the debta ol the (southern Siatee, loeal and Htate, have been lnoreaaed the enormous sum of two hundred and fifty uullkona ot dollars. This in eludes the lawa which authorise the loaning of the credit of the cUatea to various railroad soheuiea which were never carried out, except lor purposes of personal plunder, while the increased debta of the States have neoss.ll. led increased taxation. The rapid increase of the county expenditures have everywhere created the moat op pressive taxation, amounting In some in stances almost to practical repudiation. The committee might add that the ablest exponents of Radicalism in Mississippi have declared their purpose to render property valueless by taxation, that land owners, who cannot of course sell on any terms under such a system of govern ment, may be expelled. The State must first be made a desert, and then redeemed by Radical processes of regeneration.
