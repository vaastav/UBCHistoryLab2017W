All tho world is deeply concerned in the condition of John Hri^ht. which fluotnatos Kliphtlv from dav to day. but shows no sipn di permanent improvement. Il is not a had sipn, though, that his interest in the affairs ul the day is undiminished, and that he has his newspaper read to him every morning, includ? ing the Parnell Commission's proceedings and the Prime Minister's speeches nt Edinburgh, If Dr. Croshj has his way it is altogether probable, to judge from his remarks jggterdaj, that tho bill reported bj the Bm iso Revision CommisMun will romain siifliciently emphatic High License provisions to satisfy the earnest friends of that method of dealing with the liquor question. Dr. Crosby favors a fee of $1,000 for a license permitting the sale of spirituous liquors and a iee of si 00 for beer ? and wine HoeMM.

According to General Gieely, a member of tho (.eol<,gii..il Survey recently expressed the hope that the time w.,u!d soon rome when the Beaky Mountains would ho stripped of every tree. This statement was a part of the. Con aral*, paget read yaatardaj at the foie-lij Congress in Atlanta. His ptpei Wai followed by one by Colette! Edgar T. Ensign, who made a pioa im the preservation of the Rocky Moun? tain forests. There would seem te be bttiu loom f(,r choice between the two extremes. That a member of aa offloial Government bod} should favor thc destruction of our forests is astonishing. The effects of forests on streams are so well known that the preservation of them ought bo bo an important duty of tbe Government. ? The character of the outrages perpetrated In connection wilh the business of oystfr-dn-dg ing on the Chesapeake is n.,i altered by the fan that some ot the boats bail from K m York and Philadelphia, li ls said that politfa si influence operates to shield tho offenders in Maryland, and that tto brutality and poaching so. lushly, oomplained of will novar bo brohea. ! up by tho State authorities. Henoe it looks as if the Navy Department) would have to he called upon for the purpose of restoring order and punishing the criminals. The lawlessness on the CktaapW-H ll barbarous, and ought not to bo tolerated in a civilized Nation. There was considerable, difference of opinion at tho Ohambar of Commerce meeting yester? day regarding tbo silo of the new public stores. The question appears to have boon canvassed mainly in reference to this point, sinco the re? port of the committee had little to say about the Custom House and tho Assay Office. A site for tho public stores near the North River and between Tenth aad Twentieth sts. wis favored by a decisive vote. Of course, the recommendation of so influential a body as the Chamber of Commerce will have great weight whon tho final derision comes to be mado. It was a good thing to invite the co-operation of tho dry-goods and grocery trades in consid? ering the matter. The solution of the ques? tion ought to bo doiormined. to a largo extent at loavt, by the preference of tho business in- j terests most concerned A NEW POLICY. The sudden desire of Mr. Springer and the Democrats of the House to force the passago of the Omnibus bill admitting four new States has a triple purpose behind it. The first is to force Dakota into tbo Union as ono State, became they know that once admitted it is almost iinposv.il.le to divide I State; the jecond is to put New-MC-dCO as a rider on the backs of the strong new Territories of the Northwest, and get her carried into the Union in this way ; the third is undoubtedly tho hope of doing something to allay the bitterness shown in the Northwest toward the Democratic party. "Tho St. Paul Piooeer-Pressw is probably bettor in? formed uiion the sentiment of this section than any other prominent paper, and it. declares that tho Democracy made a stupendous blunder in refusing to admit these Territories a year or two ago when they might have done so. "At that time,'" says "The Pioneer-Press," "Mon? tana was stanohly Democratic, and Washing? ton the lame way bj a close voto. The people ..f a Territory are naturally and properly grate? ful to tho political party which elevates thom by its act to the dignity of a State, lt. is rea? sonably certain that if a Democratic Congress had admitted Dakota, Montana and Wash? ington, and a Democratic President bad pro? claimed them States, they would have been divided evenly politically. Parties would have neither gained nor lost. Now the course of the Democracy has made all of them Re publkan, and with that ttrong bias they will como in." Tho figures seem to support this view. Mon? tana and Washington both elected Democratic Delegates two years ago. If tho Democrats had admitted those States In tune to voto at the Presidential election just past, it is possiblo that they would have received thc electoral votes of both States, which would have al? most, if not- quito, counterbalanced the vote of the two Dakotas. But the former were shut out because tho Democratic leaders knew that Dakota must como in first, and the result is now that Montana and Washington seem about as surely Republican a_ the great Territory. Both elected Republican Delegates host month by large majorities. The Democratic leaders now tliink, apparently, that the best they can do wiih the situation from a party point of view is to keep the Dakotas down lo one State, force in New-Mexico, which they seem to count upon, and, by claiming the credit of the admis? sion of Montana and Washington, to try to win back one or both of those Territories. Thc Republican party has never made lt a practice to help the Democracy out of their blunders. It is not the time to adopt it now, i especially when this could only he done at the expense of tho rights of the intelligent and patriotic people of the Northwest. The re? fusal to divide Dakota would be even a greater outrage than ber long exclusion has been. Tho size of her population makes division proper. Tho vast extent of tho Territory renders it al? most indispensable, for Dakota i-< three-fourths ;is large aa France. Finally, division is the , wish of the people, and it should be obeyed. i ?ur Washington dispatches say that some of j the Southern lire-eaters are declaring that they will filibuster through the whole of the next ('.ingress before they will allow Dakota to ' rome in as two Slates. If these men. many of whom hold their seats by fraud, want to make this issue before the people of tho coun? try?the Solid South against Dakota, tissue I ballots against honest elections, ignorance, j fraud and violence against intelligence, peace and prosperity?the Republicans will be ready j for it. Ono result would bo that in the next I'residential election the Republican party would not need the votes of any new North? western States. bel hoe i; er f i; Urn ts. No fault is to be found with the State De? partment's action in thc case of tho Haytien Republic. The seizure of the vessel was inde? fensible, since the blockade was a fictitious uno and due notice had not been given either to tho captain or to tho United States Govern? ment Tho Slate Department _ias thc plainest warrants of international law for demanding and enforcing the surrender of tho condemned vessel. It has acted perhaps with greater de liberation than the ciicumstanoes inquired, but in the en-.! has adopted proper measure* for protecting American rights. The diplomatic correspondence in this case viii be awaited wiih some misgivings, although be Secretary*, conclusions are unmistakably ?ight. Hospitality and sympathy for insur ectioaary forces are invariably uaolosed by lim whenever a state of civil war exists afc ioma or abroad, and it is not unlikely that ho las displayed the same tendencies in this case us on former occasions. The President nn loubtedlj is prompted by Secretary Bayard, when, in bis Message, he describes Hayti as n a state of " insurrection," and discredits tho Government of Legitime, which is now ropre ented at Washington. As a matter of feel ; mag be true, si ia stated in the Message, that ire warring factions in the island, and that no Government representing the will of be Haytien people is now in wirtenofi there; mt IO long SI Legitime retains possession of be capital and has a diplomatic representative it Washington it is impolitic for the State Di ?rtment to place bim on a level with his rival, [yppolite. Legitime'? downfall may be ap trenching; Hyppolite's movement may be a ?tri i Dprising; bul anti] the Issui is de? ni' d in -ii" island the State Department n " be circumsp c in ms relations with the ? i sting Government, lt cannot havo any deal ngs with Hyppolite until Legitime is driven "rom the capital and overthrown. Secretary Bayard's earliest experience in tho ?State Dapa 11 amit ought to have warned him .gainst premature declarations in favor of in .urrectionary forces. After tho burning of Mea by the rebel forces the Colombian Min? ter, ii.ubi dal ? of April 9, 1886, infolined the [ iii" d States Government tba) oertaia ports iad bean Closed t0 foreign commerce, and that ?ertain vessels manned by insurrectionary [wees and operating against Cartagena wera lying tho Colombian Ha* without au thorny and should be dealt with as piratical craft Secretary Bayard, replying to this letter ot April 24, declined to acquiesce in these de? crees, and by implication recognfred the right' of tho insurgents as a de facto Govern iii'-n having the oountei^privlleges of belligerents This reply not only revealed tho Becsetaiy'l ignorance of international law, but rIso his se cret sympathies with (.hose in rebellion against an established Government. He virtualh recognized the belligerent rights of tho rebels and insulted a friendly Republic which wa> striving to suppress a baseless and disrep l.ablr insurrection. If tho rebellion had not been promptly ?mp preaoed Hdl unfortunate blunder would havr led to Important consecpiencas in relation tr any claims on tho Colombian Government foi damages to American property. As it was, Secretary Bayird sought an early opportunity for disclaiming any intention of recognizing the belligerent rights nf tho rebels. This did Hot prevent a review of the correspondence by the United States courts in the case of the Am brose Light, an Insurgent brigantine captured by the Pnited States Navy on April 2-i in the Caribbean Sea and sent to New-York as a prize. When the forfeiture of tho ship wan claimed sn a piratical craft soiling without au? thority from any recognized Power, the owners contended that she was entitled to a release by virtue of Secretary Bayard's letter of the same dato. Judge Addison Brown decided against the Government on the ground that while tbo seizure of the vessel wa.s warranted by tho lnw of nations, Secretary Bayard's implied recog? nition of an existing state of war and of belligerent rights operated to prevent con? demnation of tho vessel. This crushing re? buke from tho United States Court ought to have put him on his guard against incautious manifestations of sympathy with insurrection? ary forces. Wo trust that the President's reference in his Message to tho warring factions in Hayti does not conceal similar indis-crctions in the Secretary's diplomatic correspondence with the recognized Government of Hayti. Tho Got ern ment at Washington bas nothing to flo with political factions in tho island. Its dealings should bo exclusively confined to tho author? ities in possession of thc capital and to tho Haytlan Minister. THF. 

PARTY AND ITS MASTER, A President of the Pnited State* who de? liberately accuses manufacturers and corporate managers generally of Communism, which is defined by dictionaries as " a state of things in which no separate right of property exists," who charges in a State paper that manufact? urers as a class aro guilty of "selfish greed and grasping avarice," who gravely affirms that money "left in the hands of the people would havo been worth in their business at least tf pec cent pei annum," and who tells tbe poor and ignorant that laws which he is sworn to administer " make tlie boast of free institu? tions a glittering delusion and the pretended boon of American citizenship a shameless im? position," is obviously not in a state of mind to deserve much of the respect which a self governing Nation prefers to show to lt* Chief Magistrate. So "Tho Sun" mildly hints that in his Message " there is almost a touch of that indefinable quality which distinguishes the ut? terances of cranks from those of philosophers." Kven "The Times" admits the President's "errors of statement or illustration," observes that "the communism of capital" ls "not an accurato or happy expression," and that the manufacturers who are supposed to obtain im? proper favors are but few, and " do not taelndc aJl or even the greater number of our man? ufacturers," and finds his remarks " obscured by overstatement." Of such a Message and such a President patriotic feeling would prefer to say as little as possible, but for the attitude of tho great party which he represents. Ile is beaton, angry and sore; in three months the country will havo done with him. But the party which so fully expected success November <! that it has not yet recovered from its amnsement at defeat, the party whoso passions and whose ignorance Mr. Cleveland expresses, and which now glori? fies his wild words?that party still remains to do mischief, to preach the gospel of Anarchy. to inflame the ignorant against the cnterprisitier. to make itself the tool of corporations and trusts which it denounces, and to rob millions of citizens of their rights whilo pretending zeal fer tho rights of citizens. What, a grand thing it is that such a party, charged to overflowing with such a venomous, despicable and dangerous spirit, failed to get control of the Government for the next four years, lt may be dombted whether many in? telligent and order-loving people quite realize even yet what the country has escaped. But they may get some glimpse of the truth if they soberly consider tho President's Message and tho fierce expressions of Democratic approval. Democratic lovers of law and of true freedom, Democratic organizers of industry and em? ployers of labor, may learn what thc party is which they uphold by reading with care and reflection the passionate outbreak of its official head and master. As the President leaped into the saddle by his Message a year ago, distanced all possible competitors for nomination by his appeal to Democratic Ignorance and passion, and thenceforward had the party under bit and Spur, so he now teaches the world what the party actually means and is by his last annual Message. _ MR. 

GRADY'S ROARING 1LOOD. For a prophet to bo without honor in his own country is common ; but for his own coun? try to conspire to make his prophecies untiue is hard on him, indeed. In an elaborate and carefully prepared oration at Dallas, Tex., shortly before the recent Pre-j letitia! election, Mr. Henry W. Grady nsed all the force of his fervid eloquence to persuade his bearers that upon Mr. cleveland's re-election depended the safety and tho salvation of the South. "If President Cleveland is defeated," he cried, in his passionate peroration, "if President C land is defeated, which God forbid! I believe these States will bc led through sorrows com? pared to which tho woes of Reconstruction will I '? as tho fading dews of ni.lining t,, the r I lng flood!" Well, Mr. Cleveland has been defeated, What lathe present and prospective effect of his defeat upon the Booth?

STILL IS'f'ONQUERED. The result of Dr. Frithiof Nansen's Greenland fxplorinj,' expedition ls distinctly disappointing nnil discouraging. That he nnd his brave com rndes accomplished their journey In safety is of course cause for rejoicing. But lt ls evident that their toil hus fielded SOaroely anything to the world's knowledge of Greenland, while the diffi? culties they eneountcred will probably deter oth? ers from seeking further to penetrate the mys? teries of that frozen continent.. We must wait until their return to Bergen, next summer, for a detailed account of their observations, hut, the brief report already received from Dr. Nansen nt Godthaab, wlier<' they Pre spending the winter, shows 1/, what a small and unimportant rli.trict thfir explorations were limited. As hus already been related, the adventurers were " put ashore" by tbe Norwegian sealer the Jason on July 17 Inst. In fact, they were put into boats several miles from the shore, as close in, however, os the ship could go on account of the lea They expected to reach the shore the next day, probably near Rioge Ray, below Cape lian. Hut, in this they were sorely disappointed. Screwing iee and maelstroms and impassable les kept them ott, while a resistless current boro them seaward aad southward. Often they wars in the greatest p?ril of heine? wrecked in thc breakers or crushed in 1he Ice. After twelve days of drifting they made a landing at Aneretok j {.ord, near the southern extremity of (Jreenlnnd, I in about e,i degrees north latitude. They made [ their way alon.; lbs coast a little further north, to I'miiiik, and from flint, point struck inland on thdr Snowshoes, abandoning their boats alto- | gether. Skirting the northeast slopes of Mount j Ni. i.i:-, they at Brat directed their eour-e toward Christinnshaab, on tho western coast. Such vere tin- diffieulties of travel, however, ami sn slow was thi-ir progress, that they ?aw it would i be Impoaaiblo to reach that, port before the do- j partnie of the hat ship of the season for Europe, j I'lhry consequently turned toward Godthaab, a j point much further south. After altering their course, they tramped over ; miles of ice-fields hitherto untrodden by man. Hut fh"y were exactly like the ice-fields nearer , the const, which have often been explored. The ; highest altitude attained was 10,ooo feet, at I which point, the temperature was 58 degrees be- I i low zero, Fahrenheit. For several weeks they 1 straggled across a plateau more than 9,000 feet | ! high, over loose snow and amid terrible storms, i In the latter part of September they reached the WSSt coast, a little above Godthaab, and on Octo? ber _ they reached that port, just too late to get ] aboard the last ship of the year for home. In all this journey they appear to hnrve discovered nothing new, and to ha\'e gained no dat* on which to base a more substantial theory as to the character of the Greenland Continent, or ar? chipelago, or whatever it may bo. They endured great hardships, oraved great perils nnd put. forth great, exertions; for What? Merely to cross the narrow southern point of Greenland from Kin^ Frederick VTs Land through the Southern Inspectorate to the shore of Davis Strait, On tlie map they flo not appear to have trai riled more than ISO miles, nor at any point j to have ?onc more than a hundred miles from the j ernst. That, ls not exploring Greenland, any more I ! than a tramp across (Jape Colony would be rx ' plorlng Africa. Their highest latitude was be- , ' low the ?iJih parallel ami far south of the Arctic i<'ir<le.

That, may ; : iit-.cr be done. The difficulties met with by Dr. Nansen are sufficient to discourage tho boldest ' irom attempting it.

The best that can be said ls that he has not abandoned hope of bring? ing ono or more members of tho " boodle" gang to the bar of jii-it-io*, but his notions concerning the matter appeal to be exceedingly vague. "I intend to try another ease when time in which to try one can be obtained in any of the courts. The nalrnitan are now full." The Colonel at? tempts no explanation of his failure to have one of these cases put on the calendar in time tn be taken iib- In fact he seems to have no fixed determination In the matter, and it ls becoming more and more evident that the " boodle"' prose? cutions have been abandoned. There will probably be some more vague talk, from time to time, about taking up a case when the calendars are not full; but that will bc all. -? Philip Daly, author of the new romance, ? One Afternoon." aught not to lose his temper because his first effort is subjected, to honeet criticism. All our best story-tellers have undergone the same experitneo and profited by it. Having been delivered of the burden of saving the country, " The Evening Post" resumes itu pretty, kittenish ways. Nothing could be more j cute and frolicsome than Its treatment oi the linly ..hooting case this week. Having digested all the details in tho morning papers of Tuesday, it earns out with half a column in l:irge type on one of ita outride pages, and since then has supple? mented Its first report and subsequent discoveries by just the cunningest little editorial grimaces at its wicked contemporaries that, anybody ever saw. ? We learn from an editorial in " The Congreci* tionalist," presumably written by Dr Dexter him? self, that another phantom university has gone Into the business of conferring degrees upon dis? tant candidates for cheap renown, its maternal solieitii'le having lately been exercised in behalf of an Englishman whose merits had been over? looked at home, but who now rejoices, or at last accounts rejoiced, in the undisputed po^ses-don of an LL. I)., bestowed by the " Collegium Medicum Bellevue Rostonan." " The Congregationalist" finds a charter and a name, but no local habitation ; an ex-president, but no president. Th" Boston directory maintain.* an eloquent, s,lenee on the sub? ject, and even the ex-president himself was un? able to throw any light upon it. There are traces of an English agent In thc person of one Ethering ton, M. A., who recently told " The Christian World," of London, what a magnificent institution the " Collegium Modicum Bellevue Bostonati" wa*, but up to the present moment nothing has actually materialized except the charter and the ex-presi? dent ? Henry George's " educational" campaign work had some fruit, after all. There is a good deal of " Progress and Poverty" in the President's Message. "The Independent" this week completes forty years of its life, and it ls therefore an old institu? tion os such things go in this country. But ln i leasing age has brought to it none of the weak? nesses that usually appear with advancing years. Under the intelligent and far-sighted management of Mr. Henry C. Bowen, one of its original pro? prietors, and st present its sole proprietor and editor, it has kept pace with the times, and from being an organ simply of the Congregational churches, lins become one of the recognized mouth? pieces of the best thought of the day on both secular and religious topics. It has been on the right side of nearly every great question that has come up since its birth, and it has been an es? pecially strong and sturdy defender of thc Re? publican party as the party of moral ideas and true progress. It has made for itself a constitu? ency that any journal might envy, and it.s in? fluence for good has been great and far-reaching. Our congratulations and good wishe.s go with lt on thia occasion, The change from four narrow col? umns to three broad columns, which is made in the anniversary Issue, is s n>form in the right direc? tion, and will doubtless be gladly welcomed by its readers. Copies of tho Senate Tariff bill together with the Mills bill and the present tariff in full, can be obtained In Tho Tribune publication oilice for twelve cents for thc three The pamphlet con? tains tot.il quantity of imports of each class of artick-s and a good many other facts of inter e.st, which will aid the reader, a li" muses upon the debates in Congress this winter, to a clear understanding of the tariff problem. -? When al woman ls appointed to a post oflice, ..light she to be called postmaster or postmistress'.' The question is important because the records of th" IV-St Oflice Department show now that there are 3,000 women in the United States holding such commissions. Ihe tendency of the bettor usage uow is to ignore distinctions of sex in such desig? nations. There seems to be a growing preference for " author" rather than " authoress," " sculptor" is easier and more natural than " sculptress," and loone go even so far as to prefer " actor," even when applied to women. It is of interest to know that the complaints against the women postmasters are comparatively few, nnd that in the fourth class otlices their records are better than those of the men, because they
