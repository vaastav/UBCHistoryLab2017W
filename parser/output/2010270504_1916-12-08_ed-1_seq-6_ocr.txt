THE SEMI-WEEKLY TRIBUNE. NORTH PLATTE, NEBRASKA. GONGRES HEARS WILSON'S MESSAGE President's Address to Both Houses Is Quite Short. RAIL TROUBLES COME FIRST Further Legislation on That Line Is Strongly Recommended Bill Glv. Ing Foreign Commerce Promo ters Free Hand Necessary. Washington, Dec. 5. President Wil son today delivered his message to both houses of congress In Joint ses sion. Tho nddrcBB wns ns follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon mo by the Constitution of com municating to you from time to tlmo Information of the stnte of tho Union and recommending to your considera tion such legislative measures as may bo judged necessary and expedient I shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to tho reports of the several heads of tho executive departments tho elaboration of tho detailed needs, of tho public service and confine myself to Uioso matters of more general pub lic policy with which It seems neces sary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of tho congress. I rcallzo tho limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall innko my sug gestions as few as posslblo; but tlicro were somo things left tindono nt tho last session which there will now bo time to complete and which It seems necessary In tho Interest of tho1 public to do at onco. In tho first place, It seems to mo Im peratively necessary that tho earliest posslblo consideration and action should bo accorded tho remaining measures of tho program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you at the close of your last session In. view of tho pub lic dangers disclosed by tho unaccom modated difficulties which then existed, and which still unhappily contlnuo to exist, between tho railroads of tho country and their locomotlvo engineers, conductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended: First, Imtnedlato provision for tho enlargement and administrative reor ganization of tho Interstate commerce commission along tho lines embodied In tho bill recently passed by tho house of representatives and now awaiting action by tho senate; In order that tho commission may bo enabled to deal with tho many great and various duties now devolving upon It with n prompt ness and thoroughness which are, with Its present constitution and menns of action, practically Impossible. Second, tho establishment of nn eight-hour day as tho legal basis alllto of work nnd of wngos In tho employ ment of all rallwny employees who nro actually engaged In tho work of oper ating trains In Interstnto transporta tion. Third, tho authorization of tho ap pointment by tho president of a small body of men to observe tho actual re sults In experlenco of tho adoption of tho eight-hour day In. railway trans portation nlllco for tho men and for tho railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by tho con gress of tho consideration by tho In terstate commcrco commission of nn Increase of freight rotes to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may havo been rendered nec essary by tho adoption of tho eight hour day and which havo not been off sot by ndmlnlstrntlvo readjustments and economics, should tho facts dis closed Justify tho Increase. Fifth, nn amendment of tho existing fcdernl statuto which provides for tho mediation, conciliation, nnd arbitration of such controversies oh tho present by adding to It n provision that, in case tho methods of accommodation now provldod for should fnll, a full public Investigation of the mcrltH of overy such dl8puto shall bo Instituted and completed beforo a strlko or lockout may lawfully bo attempted. And, sixth, tho lodgment tu tho hands of tho executive of tho power, in enso of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of tho railroads of tho coun try ns may bo required for military use nnd to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft Into tho military service of tho United States such tralu crows and udmlnls tratlvo officials ns tho circumstances rcqulra for their safe and efficient use. Renews His Recommendations. Tho second and third of theso rec ommendations tho congress Immediate ly acted on: It established the eight hour day ih tho legal basis of work nnd wages In train service nnd It au thorized tho appointment of a com mission to observe nnd report upon the practical results, deemlm? them ii measures most Immediately needed; out it postponed action upon tho other nuggestlons until an opportunity should be offered for n more deliberate eon- tdemtlnn of them. Tho fourth rec ommendation I do not deem It neces sary to renew. Tho power of tho In tersvnte commerce cnmnitsslou to grant an Increnso of rates on tho erniiml n- ferrcd to Is Indisputably clear and n recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to oraw in question me scope or tno com mission's authority or Its Inclination to do Justice when there Is no renson to doubt cither. Tho other suggestions the Increnso In tho Interstate commerce commis sion's membership and In Its facilities for performing its mnnifold duties, rho provision for full public investigation and assessment of Industrial disputes, nnd the grant to tho executive of tho power to control nnd opernto the rail ways when necessnry In time of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. Tho necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Those who have Intrusted us with tho responsibility nnd duty of serving nnd safeguarding them In such matters woihl find it hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only docs tho Interstate com merce commission now find It practi cally impossible, with Its present mem bnrshlii nnd nrcnnlzutlrm. tn nerform its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but it Is not unlikely that It him v presently tin found ndvlsiilile tn add to Its duties still others equally heavv and exnctlnir. It must first bo perfected ns nn ndmlnlstratlvo instru ment. Tho country cannot nnd should not consent to remain any longer exposed to nrofound Industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion nnd conciliation which tho con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that thero must be no doubt as to the power of tho execu tive to make Immedlnto nnd uninter rupted use of tho railroads for tho con centration of tho military forces of tho nntlon wherever the.v nro needed nnd wheuover they nro needed. This Is a nrnirrnm of regulation, nro- vontlon and ndmlnlstratlvo efficiency which argues Its own enso In tho mere statement of It With record to ono of Its Items, the lncrcaso In tho effi ciency of the Interstnto commerce com mission, tho house of representatives has already acted: Its action needs only tho concurrence of tho senate. For Control and Operation. I would hcsltato to recommend, and dare say tho concress would hnslhitA to net upon tho suggestion should I mako-lt, that any man In any occupa tion should bo obliged bv law to con- tlnue In nn employment which ho de sired to leuvc. To pass a law which forbade or prevented tho Individual workmnn to leave bis work before re ceiving tho approval of society In do ing so would bo to ndopt a now prin ciple Into our Jurisprudence which I tnko It for granted wo aro not prepared to introduce. But tho proposal that tho operation of the rullwnvs of the country shall not be stopped or Inter rupted ny the concerted action of or-v gnnlzcd bodies of men until n public nvcstlgntlou shall havo been Instituted which shnll mnko tho wholo question at Issue plain for tho Judgment of the opinion of tho nntlon Is not to nrnnnsn any such principle. It is based upon tho very different prlnclplo that tho con certed action of powerful bodies of men snail not bo permitted to ton tho in dustrial processes of tho nation, nt any rnto neroro tlio nutlon shnll havo had an opportunity to ncmmlnt iWlf with tho merits of tho case as between em ployee and employer, tlmo to form Its opinion upon an Impnrtlnl statement of tho merits, nnd otmortunltv sldor all practicable means of concilia- tlon or arbitration. I can see uothlnir In thnt nmnnm,,n but the Justifiable safeguarding by so ciety or mo necessury processes of uh very mo. Ttioro Is nothing arbi trary or unjust in It unless it he nrhi. trnrily and unjustly done. It can and should bo done with n full and scrupu- iuuh regum mr tno intorcsts and liber ties of all concerned as well as for the permanent Interests of society ltsolf. other Legislation Urged. Threo mutters of cunltul llillinrtii ,, await the action of tho senate which nnvo already been acted upon by tho house of representatives; tim i.in which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged In pro moting tho foreign commerco of tho country tiian Is now thought by somo to bo legal under tho tonus of tho laws against monopoly ; tho bill amending tho present organic luw of Porto Hlco; and the bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of tho expenditure of money In elections, com monly culled the Corrupt Practices Act. I need not labor my ndvlco that these measures bo enacted Into law. Their urgency lies In tho manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces sury. Uven delay would seriously Jeopard the interests or the country and of the government. Immediate passage of tho bill to reg ulate the expenditure of money In elec tions may seem to bo less necessary than the Immediate enactment of tho other measures to which I refer: be cause at least two years will elapse before another election In which fed eral offices are to be tilled; but It would greatly relievo tho public mind If this Important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and tho dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining nnd spending campaign funds stand clenr under re cent observation nnd the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied In the light or present experience; and a delay would have tho further very se rious dlMidvnntngo of postponing ac tion until another election wns at hand aud some special object connected with It might be thought to bo In tho mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion or pnrtlsnn purpose. I Khali not argue at length the desir ability of giving n freur hand In the matter of combined mid fort to those who shall undertake theJ esxeuiini enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will Immediately ansnme, has Indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented In our experience. Wc have not tho necessnry instrumen talities for its prosecution; it Is deemed to bo doubtful whether they could bo crcntcd upon an adequate scale under our present laws. Wo should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must bo dono now, because tho opportunity Is here and may escape us If we hcsltato or delay. Porto Rico's Needs. Tho argument for the proposed amendments of tho organic law of Por to Hlco Is brief and conclusive. Tho present laws governing the Island and regulating the rights and privileges of Its people are not just We havo cre ated expectations of extended prlvl Iego which wo have not sntisflcd. There is uneasiness nmong tlio pcoplo of tho island and oven a suspicious doubt with regard to our Intentions concerning them which the adoption of tho pending measure would happily ro move. We do not doubt what wo wish to do In any essential particular. Wo ought to do it at once. Thero nro other matters already ad vanced to tho stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it is not necessary that I should spenk. Somo practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be fothid and nctlon taken upon them. Inasmuch as this Is, gentlemen, prob ably tho last occasion I shall havo to address tlio Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit mo to say with what genuine plcnsuro and satis faction I havo co-operated with you In the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you havo enriched tho legislative annals of tlio country. It has been a privilege to labor in such company. I tnko tho liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare scrvlcenblcness and distinction. Bound to Make Good. Tho well-dressed stranger stepped Into tho drug storo nnd, passing by the boy who usually attended to casual customers, approached tho proprietor, who was arranging some goods in tho show case. "Mr. C , I presume?" ho re marked, pleasantly, nnd tho druggist turned nnd bowed gravely. "I havo heard my friend, Mr. Quorn, speak of you often," said tho brisk man. "Ho told mo If over I needed anything In Uds line to como to you. lie spoke of you as a man on whom ono could relv with perfect confidence, who had only tho best of ovrythttig and with 'whom It was always a pleasure to deal." "Mr. Quorn Is very kind," answered tho other, beaming with gratification. "Ho is ono of by best customers. What can I do for you this morning?" "Well or this morning, ns It hap pens," said tho stranger, with Just n little briskness, "this morning I should like,-1 you will allow me, to consult your directory." "Certainly," wns the calm reply. "Wo also have a good selection of ono and two-cent stamps as well ns rallwuy tlmo tables, If you need anything of that kind." Franklin Objects Seriously. She Isn't very large, that's true, but being a county sent, and boasting of a college, several factories, flour mills, railways, intcrurbnns and her lately acquired Masonic home, Franklin feels that slio Is not a town to be passed lightly by, In fact, sho knows her Im portance, nnd thought thnt everyone In the stnto realized It until she wns taken down a bit lately. During tho big conferenco of tho Methodist churches held recently In tho town a meeting of the Indlannpolls presbytery was In session at tho same tlmo at Hopewell, a country church In a pros perous farming community a few miles out. Ono of tho Presbyterlnn delegates, on leaving tho train Joined In tho throng headed for tho Method ist church. When it camo to regis tering, somo of his Inquiries caused someone to suggest that probably he was In tho wrong place, aud ho asked Innocently: "Isn't this Hopewell?" "No, this Is Friinklln," was the proud reply. Indlnnapolis News. Rather Embarrassing. Irvln Cobb, the war correspondent, home from Europo long enough recent ly to get his breath and look over the proof sheets of a new book, attended nn uuthnrs' banquet In Now York. A deaf man sat next to Cobb. Far ther down tho table another man tolu a funny story, and when ho finished, tho deaf man laughed and uppluudcd louder . and longer than any of the rest. "Good old boy I" shouted tho deaf man. "That reminds mu of a story," ho added to thoso near by. "Got up and tell It, ChnrUe," ,crled sovetal. Tho toastmaster sanctioned tho suggestion. Then the deaf man got up nnd told the sumo story tho other man had told. He Was on the Job. The undertaker arose and said to tho mourners assembled: "If anyone present wishes to say a few words of trlhuto to tho deceased, now Is tho time, when tho family will bo glad to hear such," A stillness prevailed, and after n few moments of silence it wns broken by a young mtin, who arose and asked : "Do I understand that no ono wishes to mnko any rcmarkB?" "It would appear so," replied tho undertaker. "Then," asked tho young man, ns a light camo Into his eyes, "may I bo permitted to make -a few remarks about southern California and Its won derful climate?"

RECONVENES FOR COMPLETION OF SIXTY-FOURTH SESSION. PROGRAM 18 EXTENSIVE ONE Immigration and Corrupt Practice Measures Will Be Acted On First; Railroad Legislation Up Early. Washington. Tho Sixty-fourth con gross reconvened at noon last Moa day for its Bccond session which will end with the life of tho present con gress on March 4. Tho administration, although assured of control for four years moro in all branches, excepting possibly the House of Representa tives, has an ambitious legislative program all of which cannot bo crowded into the noxt three months. Where tho administration is to draw the lino on general legislation has not been determined. Party con ferences will outline tho program to be attempted In addition to tho appro priation bills which must bo passed to meet expenditures of government for the flscnl year 1917-1918. When congress adjourned last Sep tember, tho democratic senate caucus agreed that the immigration bill, with its oft-vetoed literacy test, would be taken up and passed before consider ation of any other legislation. It also, had agreed to act on the Owen cor rupt practices bill, a measure to limit expenditures in national political campaigns and to provide now penal ties for election frauds. Besides those two measures tho memorable railroad eight-hour day fight which marked tho last dayB of tho last session had ended with legis lation suggested by President "Wilson unconsidered. It will be urged upon the congress by the administration abovo all other subjects. In view of tho probability that the administration is to face a divldod Sixty-fifth congress, or at best a non dependablo plurality in the lower house, It is the hope of democratic leaders to complete before the March adjournment what remains of a con structive program of reform legisla tion long ago conceived. They include the public lands water power bill and tho measure to provide for develop ment or water power sites in nav igable streams by private capital. There also is pending the Newlands $60,000,000 bill for general develop ment and co-ordinated control of the country's waterways. Measures are pending also for conservation of min eral resources and improved control of the flood waters. Measures left over for which attention will be asked aro the Shafroth bill to provide civil government for Porto Rico and tho Hoke Smith bill to creato a sys tem of vocational education with fed eral aid throughout the states.
