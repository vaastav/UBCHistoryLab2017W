THE RETURNING BOARD CONTRO VERTS V. Acgumcnt of Hon. Handel! Hunt and ot Mr. K. C. Billinas. The fifth day of the argument for the de fense in the chancery suit of W. P. Kellogg against H. C. Warmoth ot als., was taken up in the Circuit Court of the United States and continued. From the argument of Hon. Randell Hunt, gorged with redun dance, an abstract has been uiade: Mr. Hunt said: May it please the court, the defense has certainly been argued with, great ability and eloquence, and whether i c insider the argument upon jurisdiction upon the one hand or upon the unconstitu tionally upon the other, I have nothing to' add: they have reaped the harvest and have left nothing for me even to glean. They have said aright that this is a most <&ovel and extraordinary case, and that nothing similar to.it has ever occurred in the history of the United States. The pro clamation of election was about to be is sued. proclaiming the result of the late elec tion. when it was stopped by this pro cedure, and your honor was called upon to enjoin the Governor from opening the re turns unless in the presence of a board which he did not recognize, and to prevent ^ay general return of State officers, so as fo leave Louisiana in a state of anarchy, jf not at the moment to generally ensue, ■ nd the grounds were an allegation made ;n the bill of fraud and corruption. I propose to say a word or two upon the jioint of jurisdiction as laid down in the constitution and the laws thereunder, upon which the jurisdiction of the courts depend. (1 Peters, 511; 8 Howard re,ports.) The act of Congress can not invest the courts with any authority not provided for in the con stitutiob. Perhaps the act of Congress im poses additional duties upon the courts under the appointment of supervisors, with which I have nothing to do at present. That the court was one of limited jurisdic tion. and that it could not extend its juris diction even to all the cases provided by Congress without a special act, except in Certain specific cases, the counselor read from "Chancellor Kent upon the Constitu tion." and concluded the point by reading from "United States vs. Hudson, 1 Crunch, 42." The counsel declared that jurisdiction was given to the court uuder the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments and %yy the act of Congress of May 30, 1810. The fifteenth provides that Congress shall liave the power to enforce this article by •'appropriate legislation" and under this constitutional provision the act in question was passed, and the counsel (Mr. Beck with) declared that the court derived its Authority from section eight, which pro vides that "whenever any person shall be defeated or deprived of any office by reason »f the denial of the right to vote 'on ac count of race, color or, previous condition, tiis right shall not be injured by such de trial, and such person may bring suit to re cover possession of said office, and in ease *t appear that the right to hoid the office i3 denied proceedings may be instituted in the circuit court, which shall have jurisdiction concurrently with the State courts." .May • t please your honor, is this a special law! What are tbo grouuds of the suit? Does it appear that the complainant is deprived of fi'is right to hold office by reason of the de nial of any citizen to vote on account of lace, color or previous condition! Who is Kellogg ? 1 hold he is not eligi ble to the the office of Governor, because he is a Senator of the Uuited States. Now. sir, I hold he is not eligible to the office of Governor, and if not eligible, he could not iiave been defeated, for no man can be de feated in a race for office where he is not eligible as a candidate, and if he could not have been defoated he has no right to bring the suit under the law ot May 31), 1870, af fording to the terms of the law, and there never was a law more carefully drawn. By the constitution of the State of Louisiana no man can hold two such offices as Gov ernor and Senator, as there is a manifest in eompatibility between these offices, and hence he is not eligible, not capable of be ing chosen. And that such is the meaning ef eligible, sour honor will recollect a case involving no question of eligibility to the the position of Senator in the United States—the case of Shields, where the question came up whether the newly elected Senator had been nine years a citi sen of the Uuited States, and the committee reported that General Shields had not been nine years a citizen at the commencement of the congressional term, but according to the argument of Stephen A. Douglas, this should be passed by because the term would he over in a few days, and it should be passed by, for then the Senator would have become olegible. "Pass it by," ex claimed Daniel Webster, "why not pass by n few months and years a3 well as days! " And the result was that General Shields was not admitted to his seat. Why was it, that in those days they put into the consti tution the article that Senators should not be elegiblo as Governors! Was it not on account of jealousy of the interference of the federal government with the affairs of the States! For he wfio is dependent upon the power in Washington, will, in all liltli hood, support that power. "Outspeeding the wind." comes down the Senator to he a candidate for Governor of Louisiana. Who is at the other end of this building 1 The collector with his depu ties. officers, tide waiters and subordinates look beiow you, the Postoffice, with its force of clerks and agents; look at the treasury officers, revenue officers, all dependent on the government at Washington. I do not say they are bribed, but they are there dependent. Now, I ask you. Judge, with voar knowledge of human nature, to de termine that such men are ineligible. I ask you as one who loves the country and desires to keep the elective franchise pure, not to inliict your poople with such corrup tion. The government of the United States is one of the people, who limit the exercise of the franchise by fSjfcmsclves by written laws, uuder a written constitution, and laws thereunder, and I would not urge this point of our peculiar system ot constitutional liberty were it not that as a constitutional jurist and patriot I believe and feel in my heart that it is correct. [A recess of ten minutes was now had.] * Kandell Hunt, resuming—I need not say to one so veraod in studies of that kind as I know you formerly were, that the lovers of human liberty have been engaged in solving the problem of extending liberty over a iarge extent of territory and render ing it free from a centralized power. Free popular governments were formerly ex tended over a small territory, and were al ways subject to gusts of passion, seditions ana strife, and too often the members of the State wore left without protection to life and property, without which govern ments fail. Men's minds were cramped, and it often happened that the leaders led the people out on expeditions of con quest, as Moses led the children of Isarel and Themistocles led the entire people of Athens out. Where these petty republics were contiguous they were divided and be set by wars, and it is impossible to read their history without feelings of disgust at their distractions. If now and then glimpses of felicity shine out from the gloom, we are admonished to lament that the vices of government would soon begin again. In the middle ages the Han seatic towns numbered uo less than one hundred separate republics, and are now reduced to three. On the other hand, I need not remind you of the danger of despotisms that extend over large surfaces of country. It was just the problem how to preserve popular institutions that prevailed in small States and then extend them over large territories, that beset the fathers of our constitution and country. In the hearts ot the heterogenous mass in the early days of the republic there was one thing in common: there burned the fire of liberty. When, sir, our fathers met and framed the constitu tion, a noble framework of government was then made, State governments lor State purposes, national government for national purpose. The general government was given certain and specific powers, the State governments reserving to themselves all the powers not conferred on the national government. Never until that day had such a government been seen. K pluribus unum —one out of many. " I challenge," said Daniel Webster, "any one of any country to show a spectacle of greatness like this." To show a country that has prospered like this. It was not an idle boast. During all this time there was one great question that beset the people: on what basis shall this structure rest ? Upon the governments national and State the right to vote is to he determined by the people in their primary capacity—the House of Representatives to be chosen by the peo ple of the several States (Const., sec. 2) but who are the electors?—those qualified to vote for the most numerous branch of the Legislature, that being determined that the (Story on Constitution) voters are for the body which should be fresh from ttiepeople. Therefore, this right of suffrage—this qual ification of an elector—were all left to each State to determine. Now, our State has reserved to-herself the right to regulate suffrage within her borders, and I think the district attorney is not correct in his statement that these lights were ever taken away. There is not one word in the thirteenth amendment that does not beat responsive to my own heart, sir. I owned slaves, and 1 thanked God that I lost them. I approve of the thirteenth amendment. I stand here and say that my voice, as his, is raised in favor of freedom to all men. I deny that there is anything in the thirteenth amendment taking away the right to regulate suffrage. Now, in the fourteenth amendment there is put a pen alty upon the State that shall discriminate in regulating suffrage in favor of white. Still, the power of the State to regulate suf frage is not taken away. Nor is there aught in the fifteenth amendment. They intended CoDgress should pass some law enforcing the last amendment, and the law of the thir tieth of 'May, 1870, was passed two months after the adoption of the amendment itself. Now. I ask your honor's attention to this point: Your honor i3 well aware there are many points to be urged in a contested election, such as intimidation, menaces and frauds; but for none of these causes can a party bring a suit under this law— there is but one state of circumstances giv ing under the law above a right to bring suit in this court, and if there are any other reasons of his defeat he must go to the State courts. And, saving these amend ments and the laws, there is not one line in the written laws impairing the rights of any State to regulate the suffrage of her' citizens. Sir, 1 heard with horror the state ments of the opposing counsel, that the citizenship of a State was a mere local dis tinction. Sir, it is a State distinction, and citizenship of the United States is our na tional distinction. Even in the law the ju risdiction is not given exclusively to you as a judge of the United States, but is ex pressly given "concurrently with the State courts." The right of bringing suit is by the law only given to the one defeated, not to the one who appears defeated, and here lies the jurisdiction which can not be ex tended by presumption. Sir, it js a matter of this jurisdiction to examine into the question of who is the proper returning board, Wharton and others or Hawkins and others, and were this question brought be fore you collaterally, you would say "Away with this; your duty is to bring a direct ac tion." I ask where is the authority to in vestigate this question collaterally: and further, it the action was brought direct, you would not examine into it. The only two parties that could , bring the action were Kellogg on the one hand and MeEaery on the other. Can they change the nature of the case by bringingaa injunction J "What do you want ?'•' we say. "We want evidence to carry on out direct case." "But if the direct v:.** ww there, you couldn't use it." See. if you support thi* ease, thateach* officer in the State will come before you for his own preferment. Sir. if it is said that John McEnery gained in tb' election by fraud. I am sorry for those wh<* say it. He i*elected Governor by the vote of the neo p'e, to uphold liberty. But what sort of liberty is it if parties who could not bring a direct action are entitled t.» bring by in junction rhecutire State, executive, judicial and legislative, within the seoye ot thi* ju dicial arm. Mr. Hunt closed in » rhetorical burst in the entreaty to the judge to soy with the old Roman consul, "Procul, O procti: astute Away, away with men learned in villainy. Mr. E. €. Billings—Slay if please the court. I propose to say something first upon the question of eligibility. The State constitutional provision was in the consti tution of 1812, and at that time a different class of people were here. The constitution of Texas has a similar but more extended provision. Now, what is the meaning of the word eligible, upon which the whole question turns ? You will find it signifies "capable of being elected," or capable of holding an office. Now, what was the in tent of the framers of the constitution that there should not be a person placed in office where the duties ot one office held at tbo same time should conflict ' And, there fore, the vision with which my friend Semmes was troubled of the interference of the government did not pass before the mind's eye of those who provided in this article. Its aim was to provide against any divided allegiance, for it was made at a time when the distinction between States rights upon the one hand and tne rights under the United States were sharply drawn. By the Court—I cite the instance whence this article originated. It was i:i the elec tion ot Governor Claiborne, who was a United States officer—Territorial Governor of Louisiana. Now it was provided, sard the counsel resuming, in article fourteen of the consti tution of the United States, that no person shall be eligible to the seat of Senator in Congress who shall not at the time have been nine years a citizen of the United States. I pass by the California case cited, and will adduce other authorities, that the whole weight of these are to the support ot the theory that the oandidate shall be capa ble of holding the office when he is in stalled. The whole power of the amendments cited is directly brought into play, that the right of suffrage shall not be denied to this class of our citizens newly enfranchised. Now I hold that it i3 within the power of this court, under the law, to interfere in the scope of its jurisdiction at any time. The jurisdiction is as full and complete over all parties in the State who attempt to deny the right of suffrage on a distinction of race or color, as it is on the'subject of patents. When the framers of this law first pro nounced that the right of suffrage should not be interfered with, they follow it up to the very last in the law. They have said universally that, as matter of law, that wherever any person having been denied registry shall after offer to vote and be refused, it is taken imperateiy in the statute that the vote so offered shall be deemed as good as cast. The right ot any individual to hold office they have said shall not be impaired by any denial of per sons of the right to vote. Then we see these great principles declared by Congress extend to all election*. And tne jurisdic tion of this court shall extend, by express terms in the law, to ail cases of contest "arising under this act," and wherever there is an infraction done or an infraction at tempted, then the party aggrieved can claim all the redress the law can give in this court. (Whitlock—an English case.) (Cases were read showing that wherever a statute laid down a principle, the aggrieved party would bring his action. Therefore under the principle laid down in this law the party aggrieved can bring his action; whether voters have bean denied or an attempt has been made to deny them, the party aggrieved can bring his action here, even to prevent the denial of the right of suffrage. This law is not only an entry, but a complete subversion of State rights. The whole subject of suffrage which is the beginning and the end of a Republican form of government, for by admissions of Demo cratic members, both of the House and Sen ate, every .office could be brought in here and canvassed as well go* back to the deluge, as to any period before the adoption of tills amend ment. Under this there' is nothing that Congress can not do (which shall be appro priate legislation) to enforce the right of the colored man to vote, and to go further, to hold that every vote denied should be taken as if it was cast (for it was cast under the law). 1 have offered to prove that from twelve to fffieen thousand men were denied the privilege of voting. This vexed ques tion of suff rage was at last pronounced upon finally and forever in the amendments. What a mockery was the Dred Scott de cision, that no descendant of a slave could ever come into a circuit court of the United States to claim his rights ! When the ques tion vexed Congress again it vexed Lin coln, and the pitiful project came up to pay for the emancipated of slaves of the South. Then came the emancipation pro clamation, a military necessity, and the master stroke of the war, which flung upon us 4,000,000 of enfranchised slaves. Then came the amendments and the laws under them, which direct that the colored man shall be tree and his freedom shall be for ever maintained. (Law3 and statutes in Mississippi and Louisiana providing lor the arrest and management of vagrants and apprentices, negroes, freed men and mulattoes. and inflicting penalties upon them.) It was to prevent emancipa tion being disregarded and trifled with, the counsel held, by such iaws, which virtually reduced h:m to slavery again, that these amendments were passed. Laws were further read providing tor corporeal punishment being inflicted tor disobedience of orders of his employer, among them laws ot Florida and Virginia. Sueh "vagrants" weie to be punished in these laws with ball and ehain, with the whipping post._ Inade quate wages were provided for making the whole condition one of servitude of the colored man in all but its name. This pic ture of the colored man again failing into slavery by enactments was presented to Congress, and the question arose of how to prevent it. What would the world have said were such a condition ofthings allowed to remain as in the year 18(55? And hence it was that suffrage was placed^ on an en during basis, and it was made the interest of candidates to see that this right was respected. What a labor would it be were the parties aggrieved by denial of the right of suffrage to bring in a writ of quo war ranto; what a labor like that of the mountain which brings forth the mouse. I: was there fore provided that the votes cast through a demise of suffrage of-the colored man should go for nothing. Had Mr. Kellogg come into the court and simply said, 'I am about to be defeated by refusal of colored men of the opportunity to vote" teat would have been sufficient. 'I be case ot Freeman vs. Hood (24 Howe), was where the plain tiff, having his property seized, had gone into the United States Circuit Court and replevined it, and it was decided that the principle was that if the court had juris diction over tire main it had over the aux iliary suit. The jurisdiction of the court comes simply from this matter; the whole question regarding the right of voting is made subject to the juriadicHon of this court. Suppose in a case of struggle for a patent it were said that the plaintiff was not the assignee of the pytent .would The court not have jurisdiction over the main case ot patents: that the court bail not ju risdiction over the incidents as well as the original case! So it is in this ease; the court has jurisdiction over Jhe canvassers, an incident, a collat eral issue as well a* over the main question. The law gives the court jurisdiction over all cases arising under the provisions of the law which has settled that the wrongs which may arise under a denial of the right to vote to the colored man. f do not believe that Congress so carefully considered the law that it is to be baffled in its purpose. I see nothing in this but the tremendous ingenuity ot counsel. The fra mers of this law sought to bury the question out of sight,.to settle it. _M establish a bul wark which would venae;* ai: effort* di rected to the object of denying the right to vote futile, and to afford u remedy in this tour?. All that your honor has 'to <to is to ask are these averments true ! have there been so many thousands denied the oppor tunity of voting by & refusal of registra tion?' [A ease arising m G.do where "the soldie? vote" Was refused and a mandamus ■wm applied for and obtained.j It was a case arising precisely similar to the case in point, where the propriety of nay mode by which redress may he had of wrong fiicted under the disobedience ot the law, the propriety of any proceeding was recog nized and affirmed. Here the counsel closed, to continue at session of the court to-day, to which the court adjourned. THE EIGHTH COURT INJUNCTION. A Writ of Certiorari for It—The Whole Case Returnable to the tailed State* Circuit Court. It will be recollected that the fact that a prayer for an injunction had been filed by Governor Warmoth against James Long street et als was published Sunday, the lat , ter being called on to desist from all inter ference with the returning officers of the election, and that they bo forbidden from compiling or pretending to compile* the votes cast at the late election, and be pro hibited from making any return or pro clamation of the result of said election. United States District Attorney Beckwith yesterday filed a petition expressing the above circumstances, and winding up with a prayer that the whole ease, consisting in a oetitioa and a rule nisi, be brought up fo the United States Circuit Court. The pe tition to this court is prayed for by the Her ron returning board. The whole doctrine of certiorari in the laws of the Lnited States was laid down as far back as 1832, at which time suits having been brought in South Carolina against collectors oi reve nue. where it was refused to bring them to the Uuited States courts, when the laws were made establishing the right as it now exists. But it is the first time in the history of the country that a writ of this character has been served in a case among State offi cers, and hence it is all the more interest ing in bringing directly before the people the true relation of the federal tribunal act ing under the law known as the enforce ment act, toward the State courts and the condition of election affairs. The petition to the judge of the Circuit Court for the district oi Louisiana discloses the following facts: That Francis J. Herron, John Lynch and Jacob Hawkins are the duly qualified returning board, duly charged by law with the duty of making returns of ballots deposited at the late election, at which Representatives for Congress were voted for; that, among their.duties, is to ascertain what persons voted for are re turned Representatives ia Congress, and the law3 demand penalties for aon-per formance of said duty and against all per sons who ghali hinder them; that, in order to hinder them in the performance'of their duties, Henry C. Warmoth, claiming to act as Governor,' with the intention to suspend all official action by your petitioners, has brought in the Eighth District Court a suit, the intention of which is to enjoin the petitioner from obeying the mandates of the laws of the United States in regard to said election, lour pe titioners have been served with an order commanding them to desist trom any fur ther obedience to the laws of the Lnited States relating to the election ugtd the pleasure of the Eighth District Court. That the nature of the suit is intended to Obstruct the petitioners ia the discharge of duties imposed upon them by the enforcement act ot Congress. Wherefore, your petitioners pray for a writ of certiorari, directing the j udge of the Eighth District Court to send, without de lay. to the Circuit Court of the United States the record and proceedings in cause No. 18,579.'entitled State on the relation of Henry C. Warmoth vs. James Longstreet et als". „ . . . . By the court-—Let a writ of oertonan is sue as prayed for, returnable torthwith at the present term of coart. BY

WASHINGTON . Debt Statement—Decrease Lass Mouth-* The Treasury Report, Washington, December k.— The debt statement shows a decrease of #1,525,000. Coin in the treasury $69,500,009. Currency $10,125,030. The treasury report say# that the neces sity exist3 for a new issue of national bunks notes. The Secretary exonerates assistant treas urer Hillhouse from neglect o' duty in the stamp division of assistant treasury at New York. The Secretary again recommends the passage of a hill to amend and consolidate navigation and customs law# ot the United States, as the leading pursuits of the coun try are now stronger than ever before. In the possession ot adequate capital and a supply of intelligent laborer#, there may be a moderate deduction from time So time in the rate of duties, as the diminishing ex penses o! the government sha.i permit, with out either alarming capita; or injuring labor. * . . ....... He tays tne circulation e; tne banks should lie fixed and limited, and that the isower to change the volume of paper in circulation within the limits established by law should remain in the Treasury Depart ment. A degree of flexibility in the volume of currency is essential for two reasons. First, the business of the department can not be transacted properly it' a limit is fixed and the power to raise the circulation i'vove ix'..v r ...•••.( Secondly, there is a necessity eveiy autumn for moving the crops without delay from the South and West to the seaboard that they may be ea hand for export and con rumption as wanted. Tile problem is to find a way of increas ing the currency, for moving the crops and diminishing it at once when that work is done. This is necessary w much as it can not be conihL the power should bo repose urv Department, believing no* prepared to sustain the traction The Secretary considers which the value of our eu: improved. The basis of oi: provement# must be found fusal to add to the paper in circulation until it 13 of the same value, essentially, as coin. This being accepted as^the settled purpose ot the country, there can be no permanent increase of the difference between paper and cum. and an opportunity will be given for the influence of natural causes, tending upon the whole to a better financial condi tion. All legislation limited in its operation the paper issues ot the government,whether bearing interest or not. and which in its •effects shall tend to diminish the market value of coin, will be found upon an analy sis to contain a plan tor contracting the volume of paper currency, and all legisla tion so limited which does not contain such apian will prove ineffectual. The Secretary, without proceeding to the discussion of the general subject of resum ing specie payments, thinks all will have been gained that is of value when the treas ury shall be prepared to pay the demand notes of the government in coin, and the banks shall bo prepared to pay their notes either in coin or legal fender notes, and then our good fortune will clearly appear in this, that our paper currency is not ex clusively of national bank notes nor exclu sively of United States notes. •rk. and, inas to the oanks. l ia ' the Treas -he < eountry is foil .cy of con ' means by IV: nc y may be r poi .icy of im in* a aturdy re NEW VOltlf.

The Funeral To-morrow—Resolutions of Respect—The Greeley Electoral Vote Elaborate Preparations for the Fu neral—Resolution of Congress—National Democratic Committee — President Grant nud the Fuuerul. New York, December 1.—The trustees of the Tribune, at a meeting held Saturday, appointed a committee to take entire charge ot the arrangements for Mr. Greeley's fun eral. They have fixed it for Wednesday, at eleven o'clock, from the Church of the Di vine Paternity (Rev. Dr. Chapins), on f ifth avenue. No special invitations will be sent out, but organizations of various kinds are taking formal steps to attend in a body. The Liberal Club of this city, of which Mr. Greeley was president, met this evening and passed resolutions expressive of their regret at his death, which characterize it as a loss not oniy to the country, but to the whole world. The Herald Club and Tygographical So ciety also passed resolutions of condolence. The remains of Mr. Greeley will be taken to the residence of Samuel Sinclair, in this city. The Herald mentions that the Union League have hopes that President Grant will take part in the obsequies. New York, December 2. —The Tribune editorially says the electoral colleges of States voting tor Mr. Greoley should cast their votes for Grant. Mr. Beecher, in a sermon, attributed Mr. Greeley's death to a broken heart. The World says that Air. Greeley's eleeto r d votes should be cast blank. The belief that the President will attend the funeral of Mr. Greeley gives general satisfaction. Washington, December 2. —The chap lains in Congress mentioned Mr. Greeley in their prayers. The Senate passed the House resolution regarding Mr. Greeley. New York, December 2.—Elaborate preparations are being made for Mr. Gree ley's funeral on Wednesday next. Miss Kellogg and other leading singers have vol unteered for the choir at Dr. Chapin's church, wilch is draped in mourning. All ve 8els' flags are at half mast.

We print the message of the President this morning as it was transmitted to us by the Associated Press. Doubt less there are unimportant errors in the report furnished by telegraph, and in our efforts to make sense of some para graphs which the telegraph operators badly confused, we do not claim a success. But we have the substance of the message, if not the actual text, and know what the President means, especially about the vig orous execution of the enforcement acta. The St. Louis City Council being in ses sion Friday when tho announcement of Mr. Greeley's death was received, adopted the following resolutions: Resolved, That the City Council of the city of St. Louis receive with deep regret the intelligence of the death of Horace Greeley; and deeming this a fitting time to express their appreciation of the patriotism of the man and the sterling integrity and unrivaled industry which has marked his career in life, and which enabled him as a private citizen to exercise an influence greater than that accorded to men who had achieved the highest public honor. Resolved, That the Mayor he requested to convey to the family of the honored and eminent journalist the deep sympathy of the citizens of St. Louis for them in their great affliction. A man at Keoknk has started an office furnished with a pair of blacksmith's bel lows, for the inflating of rubber bustles, and the fashionable ladies go there once a day to get blown up. Inflated rebber bustles are the latest popular whim of fashion. It takes a young husband with weak lungs half an hoar to blow his wife up to a fashionable rotundity THE

BOSTON FIRE. , eX u e -Pf ion of the recent devaa Vt " U ', swept from the earth witu a breath, as it were, millions of accu mulated wealth in the city of Boston, there has been no overshadowing calamity with in the year to record. It is gratifying to note how like their fellow citizens of the city ot Chicago, under similar circum stances a year earlier, the citizens of Bos ton are rallying under their misfortunes, and the prospect.is that their energy and perseverance will overcome all obstacles, and show the same prosperity soon that they would had no disaster befallen them. Otherwise we have been free from pesti lence, war and calamities which often over take nations, and as far as human judg ment can penetrate the future, no cause seems to exist to threaten our present peace. r THE 

GENEVA ARBITRATION. W hen Congress adjourned in June last a question had been raised by Great Britain, and was then pending, which, for a time, seriously imperiled the settlement by° friendly arbitration of the grave differences between this government and that of In r Kptanmc majesty, which, by the treaty of \\ ashington, had been referred to the tri bunal ot arbitration which had met at Geneva, in Switzerland. The arbitrators, however, disposed of the question whioh had jeopardized the whole of the treaty and threatened to involve the two nations in. post unhappy relations toward each osber, in a manner entirely satisfactory to this government, and ia accordance with the views and the policy which it had main tained. Ihe tribunal which had convened at Geneva ia December, concluded its la borious session on the fifth of September last, on which day, having availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by tho treaty to award a sain in gross, it made its decision, whereby it awarded the sum of $15,500,000 iu gold as indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the United States for the satisfaction ot all the claims referred to its consideration. This decision happily disposed of a long standing difference between the two gov ernments. and in connection with another award made by the German Emperor, under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves these two governments without a shadow upon the friendly relations which, it is my sincere hope, may forever remain equally unclouded. The report of the agent of the United States, appointed to the amended Geneva tribunal, accompanied by the protocols of the proceedings of the arbitrators, the ar guments ot the counsel of both govern ments, the award of the tribunal and the opinion given by the several arbitrators,' is transmitted herewith. THE THREE FRIENDLY POWERS. I have caused to he communicated to the heads of the three friendly powers who complied with the joint request made them under the treaty, the thanks of this govern inent for the appointment of arbitrators made by them; and also my thanks to the eminent personages named by them, and my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality and great ability with whioh they discharged their arduous and high functions. Her Majeatj's government has commun' cated to me the appreciation by her Majesty of the ability and indefatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named on the part of this government, (lur ing the protracted inquiries and discussions ol the tribunal. I cordially unite with her Majesty in this appreciation. It is due to the agent of the United States before the tribunal to record my high appreciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience, and the prudence aud discretion with which he has conducted the very responsible and delicate duties committed to him. as it ia also due to the learned and eminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this government, to express my souse of the talents and wisdom which thev brought to bear on the attainment-of the result so happily reached. PAYING THE INDEMNITY. It will be the province of Congress to provide for the distribution among those who may be entitled to it of their respective shares of the money to be paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable until a year from the date of the award, it is deem ed advisable that no time bo lost in making a proper examination of the several cases in which indemnification may be due. t consequently recommend the creation of a board of commissioners for the purpose. THE SAN JUAN BOUNDARY. By the thirty-fourth article of the treaty of Washington the respective claims of the United States and of Great Britain in their construction of the treaty of the fifteenth of June, 1846. declaring the boundary line between their respective territories, were submitted to the arbitration and award of his Majesty the Emperor of Germany to decide which of those claims is most in ac cordance with the due interpretation of the treaty of 1840. THANKS TO THE EMPEROR OF GERMANY. Hisj Majesty the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to undertake the arbi tration, has the earnest thanks of this gov ernment and of the people of the United States, for the labor, pains and care which he has devoted to the consideration of this long pending aifference. 1 have caused an expression of my thanks to be communi cated to his Majesty. ms. Bancroft's services. Mr. Bancroft, the representative of this government at Berlin, conducted the case and prepared the statement on the part of the United States with the ability that hia past services justified the public in expect ing at his hands. As a member of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given rise to the discussion between the two governments, as the minister to Great Britain when the construction now pro nounced unfounded was first advanced, and as the agent and representative of this government to present the case and to re ceive the award, he has been associated with the question in all of its phases, and in every stage has manifested a patriotic zeal and earnestness in the maintenance of the claim of the United States. He is entitled to much credit for the success which has attended the submission, after a patient in vestigation of the case and of the state ments of each party. His majesty the Emperor, on the twenty first (lay of October last, signed his award in writing, decreeing that the claim of tho government of the United States that tho boundary line between the territories of her Britannic majesty and the United States should be drawn through the Haro channel, as most in accordance with the true inter pretation of .the treaty concluded on the fifteenth of .June. 1846, between the gov ernments of her Britannic majesty and°tha United States. Copies of the case presented! on behalf of each government, and of the statement in reply of each, and a translation of the award, are transmitted herewith. This award confirms the United States in their claim to the important archipelago of islands lying between the continent and Vancouver's island, which, for more than twenty-six years—ever since the ratification of the treaty—Great Britain has contested, and leaves us, for the first time in the his tory of the United States as a nation, with out a question of disputed boundary be tween our territory and the possessions of Great Britain on this continent.
