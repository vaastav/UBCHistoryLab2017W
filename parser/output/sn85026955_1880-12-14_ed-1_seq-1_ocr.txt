Ihe message la the longest Slate paper, eit to Congress by President Hayes. It starts out with a review of the present condition of the country and dwells a eon.e length Usn the rapid growth n our national prosperity, our boiintiru rope and sound flnaiiclil system, ami predicts -Hit greater proHjiei lty for the future. The President Incidentally me n llons the growth of education through out the country and the necessity of los. terlng It by proper legislation, and nir ther, when reviewing the report of the Co.n.nlMlonrrs on Kilnc..!!..... fl"" details of a plan approved by b in the further development of educational fa cilities. ,

He also expressea the be lief that the era of bloodshed on account Of political difference has passed, ami pofnta to the fact that there Is now less Intimidation and violence In the South than was practiced a few years ago.

BRISTOL, VIRGINIA St TENNESSEE, TUESDAY, lights nrc begliuiing to ho almost uni versally respected. The next stage In Southern development will soon come. This will arrive thiotigh divisions in the white ruling element and when the divisions come the negro will be an object ol protection and In terest to all political parties. Through tills division something like an honest ballot will be secured and the rights of all respected. The President thinks that education In the South Mill ultimately restore the harmony between the sec tions and raise the negro tOf a plane of development where he will ' be able to protect himself. It is iu this portion of the Message that tho President may be said to review his administration, i ii u Moiimon ji;i:sriON. Upon the Mormon Question the Pres ident uses plain language mid urges Con gress to adopt such measures as will se cure the speedy abolishment of Dial evil. I'he President says that the fact that so largo a community has been permitted to live in Open evil in defiance of the laws of the United States and of morali ty, Is a national disgrace, and one that should be remedied without delay. Con gress Is called upon to give early anil earnest attention to this subject, that the people of I' tah may be required to con form to the same laws and regulations that govern the restol the country. The President suggests, to Congress that if there, is no way of reaching polygamists under the present organization of the Territory that its entire system of local government should lie reorganized with a view of providing a swift and speedy method of prosecuting and properly punishing all who persist Iu practising Polygamy. Those who have credited Ilie'Presi'dent with having become con verted In a measure to looking with len iency upon Mormon practices ihrough his recent visit west will have their mind thoroughly disabused by reading this energetic appeal to a retiring Demo cratic Congress. CIVIL RlillVlCX ISEKOHM. The next subjocf discussed Is one that will not attract great public attention. J t is devoted to what the President is pleased te call civil service, and Is one of the longest chapters In the Message. Tho financial chapter Is the only ether one that, approaches It hi length. In theory Mr. Hayes believes Iu appointing good men to ot'llce and continuing them (luring good behavior. He believes, al so, in the theory of separating govern ment services from politics, elaborates his well known theories upon this sub ject, mid points In Illustration to the Im provement made In I In? administration of the New York Custom House and In the New York Tost Otllce. l-OKKIOX IllM.ATlOSS. He then takes up the subject of our foreign relations, as presented by the Slate Department, and reviews the con dition of affairs between the government and leading foreign jiovernmentg There ure three subjects that are outside of the routine report of pleasant relations with oilier countries. The part relating to England gives the current history of the North American llsbeiies question, and repeats the views or the President in it special message that lie sent to Con gress last spring, which In effect, recom mended the rosinralion of duly on Caii Hiliaii ttsh and llsli oil. The recommen dation of the Secretary of State iu re gard to Inipioving our commercial rela tions by the co-operation of the entire consular scu Ice as agents in promoting the Interest of American eeinmeree, are eaiiieslly commended to the attention ol Congress. The full reports of the ln vestlgstlona of our consul.! and the bet ter channels Indicated by them for a profitable commerce are used by the President, to recommend legislation for the development of oiu merchant ma- f'ue. ... . , The President does not believe In sub sidles, but be docs approve of giving lib eral mall contracts to pioneer merchant marine enterprises as one means of en coiirsglng an Industry which he thinks through an unwise policy Is now lan guishing. TUB KKW f lll.ST.Si: TKKATIKH. The next subject of special Interest In our foreign relations consists of a recital of the appointment of the Chinese Com mission mid Its work. The President promises to send a special message on the subject when the rull text of the treaties Is received at the Stale Depart ment. The point of these treaties Is giv en so far s it Is proper l divulge them at llic present time, lie says that the first treat V Is a modification of the Ilur llngame Treaty, and solves satisfactorily the Chinese question In politics III lb s country. The Chinese government s not at iill anxious In have Its subjects emigrate, and was willing to meet, our Commission more than half way In all restrictions upon Chinese Immigration lo lids country suggested by Ino Com mission. The point of the second treaty relates entirely to commerce; bill as the Slate Department lias not got the lest or the document tho Message briefly sum marizes the fids us gaining to the coun try Increased commercial facilities.

At the present time all of tho great commercial ports of the United States nro absolutely in a defenseless condition, mid In the event of foreign trouble Incalculable damage could be done to our commercial, interests beforo the first steps of u real defence could be made. The President calls upon Con gress to take this subject into considera tion and to provide for a system of lib eral appropriations to remedy this great weakness. TIIK NAVY DKPARTMEXT. The Navy Department gets but a short chanter, and this tor tlie reason mat hec rctary Thompson asked for but, little to lie inserted iu the message. He speaks in Eulogistic terms of Secretary 1 liomp son's nHiiageinent and approves of the Secretary's plan for the encouragement of our merchant murine, already alluded to under Ihe head of the State Depart ment. The same suggestion by the Postmaster General is also approved. lie docs not endorse Mr. Maynard's sug gestions. Ho recommends only tlie adoption of a post olllce savings bank scheme, but says nothing about the pos tal telegraph. UKI'ARTMKXT OF Jt'STlCE. Under the head of Department "or Justice the President speaks ot the At torney General's recommendation that a siiftlcieut amount be appropriated by Congress for the payment of the deputy marshals. He also rcjommends that Congress pass some bill authorizing the establishment of an Intermediary court between the United States Circuit courts and the Supreme Court, for the purpose or relieving the extraordinary pressure of business under which tlie latter is struggling. The most pronon need fea ture of Attorney General Doyens' report the President does not even diseusi; and does not mention It in the message. At torney General Devon, in an elaborate m iniier, urges upon Congress the pro priety of national supervision ,of the ballot In all national elections, and re commends that Congress take the posi tion that in national elections Slate lines are not to be considered and that na tional authority be directed lo protect tlie ballot box from fraud and Intimida tion in all sections of tlie country. The President, while agreeing with tho Ideas of General Devens on Ibis subject, did not think It best to incorporate this re commendation in the message. tiik iNTi:i!iDii mtahi.mi:nt. The Interior Department is given quite a long chapter. The President re views Secretary Schurz's policy toward Ihe Indians with great approval, and thinks that bis plan for educating the Indian, so that lie can lake care of him self, the only true solution of tlie Indian question. lie calls upon Congress lo give aid In tlie way of appropriation!- lo encourage this plan, which looks to lh establishment of the Indian iimiii lands of his own, breaking up of all tribal re lations and the gradual withdrawal of financial support, upon (lie part of the government. Following this review of the departments Mr. Haves has a special ly good word to sav for the work of the ('oimulssloner of Agriculture, mid speaks of the success of Mr. Ee Due In his experiments for the growth of tea In Ibis country and (lie manulacture of su g.ir from cornstalks. The President next alludes lo the re port of the Commissioner of. Education. The chief point of this paragraph of the message Is tho President's recommenda tion that the remainder of the public lauds of the country be s-l aside for ihe education of Illiterate persons of nil sec liens. This would result, the President sav, In giving nm.l of it to the South wiietc Ihe greatest Illiteracy prevails. The education of this class, both while and black, would have a tendency lo place the two seel loin upon a closer In tellectual level, and consequently In a closer bond of union. tiii: Disinter of t oi t muia. Then follows the eloslii'; chapter of Mr. Haves' last annual message. This relates entirely to affairs of the DlstrlW of Columbia. No President has evet taken more Interest In the District than Mr. Haves.

Whenever a non-taxable, railroad is sold out under a deed or trust it becomes liable to taxation, if we understand aright a decision rendered last Monday by tho Supremo Court of tlie United Slates iu the case of the E. T. V. & G. . K. Co. r. Hainhliii county, Tenn., on appeal from Supreme Court of Ten nessee. Tho Supreme Cnurt of the United States held that that case was governed by that of Morgan rs. Louisi ana (113 U. S. 21 7), in which it was de cided that immunity from taxation is not such a franchise of a railroad corpo ration as would pass by sale under mort gage on "the property and franchises of a company." The "franchise" of ex empt ion froin taxation thus disappears in a cloud. Tlie original company lias it. As long as they own the railroad It remains a valuable privilege. I!ut, pres to, change ! theo give a deed of trust, the road is sold, and Ihe right of exemp tion vanishes. The ow ners lose it. The new ones do not gain It. Anyhow, it is an important decision. llkhmond Pis-patch. Fort;etniiiiofcn rivopio.
