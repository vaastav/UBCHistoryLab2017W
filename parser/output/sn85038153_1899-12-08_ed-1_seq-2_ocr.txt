Speaking in his message to Congress on the question ot Trusts, fresiaent McKinley says: ' 'Combinations of capital organized in to trusts to control the conditions of trade among our citizens, to stifle com petition, limit production, and deter mine the prices of products used and consumed by the people, are justly provoking public discussion, and should early claim the attention of Congress. "The industrial commission, created by the act of Congress of June 18, 1898, has been engaged in extended hear ings upon the disputed questions in volved in the subject of combinations in restraint of trade and competition. They have not yet completed their in vestigation of this subject, and the conclusions and recommendations at which they may arrive are undeter mined. "The subject is one elving rise to many divergent views as to the nature and variety or cause and extent of the injuries to the public which may result

THE SICKNESS OF MOODY. The physician of Mr. D. L. Moody has issued a bulletin in reference to th' recent alarming illness of the dis tinguished evangelist and his present condition, in which he says : "Mr. Moody is suffering from a weak ened heart, the weakness causing dila tion, and that his condition is due to overwork. nis ailment has caused physical depression, but the patient is- able to be dressed aud walk from hin bed to a chair. He suffers at times from difficult breathing. "Mr. Moody will eventually recover. He sees no one except the family. He receives many letters of sympathy from friends in all parts of the country, and expresses gratitude for the thoughtful remembrances which they indicate." There has been a dearth of news from the I5oer war for a few days, but there is daily expectation of news of decisive battles. Gen. Methuen's army has baited, six miles north of Modder riv er, to bring up ammunition, supplies and reenforcements. The Hoers have fallen back to a range of hills, half way to Kimberly. November 2o, a reconnoUance was made in force from Kimberly by a mounted force under Scott Turner. The sortie was made at dawn, in the di rection of a ridge near Carter's .farm, where the Boers were strongly en trenched. Finding the Boer pickets asleep, Col.. Scott-Turner proceeded along the ridge under cover, and rushed the Boer redoubts, at 5:25 a. m., in the face ot a storm of bullets. The Boers hoisted a white flag rnd fired at the British, under its protection before, surrendering. As Boer renforcements were approaching, the British could not follow up their advantage but had to fall buck. During the sortie, an ar mored train was run north and south from Kimberly, while a considerable force of British, with field guns and Maxims, advanced toward Spytzfontein, holding the Boers in check In that di rection. The British captured twenty eight of the Boers. A Boer force is reported threatening Stomberg, 200 miles sobtheast of Kim berly, where General Gotacrehas gath ered a British force. The morning of December 2, there was a hot artillery duel at Mafeking, Friday, the Boers opened fire on La dysmith with a large gun that threw shells into the British camps, and disa bled several of the British guns. Heliograph communication wilh La dytmith, shows that all was quiet there Sunday. Geu. Buller in disptches to London snys the Boers greatly underestimate their losses. So far, there has been hard fighting on both sides, with but little display of strategical abijity on either side. whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not only to the common law, but also to the public welfare. There must be a remedy for the evils involved in such organizations. If the present law can be extended more certainly to control or check these monopolies or trusts, it should be done without delay.
