The opening of congerss this year v as n0 t unlike that of previous years although it was enlivened by some ecial features. For instance, there was the return of Uncle Joe Cannon who. despite his eighty years, did the comeback act and was received with the acclaim due one who has served thirty-eight years in one position, a record for service never attained by any other man in the history of our government. The newest member there appeared not one whit happier than did the grizzled veteran from Danville and his personal popularity even among his bitterest political ad versaries was attested by the steady stream of friends, old and new, to his seat to greet and congratulate him. All day long he smiled and joked and smoked and otherwise manifested the joy that was in him at being once more on his old stamping grounds. While the senate proceeded with a semblance of dignity and decorum, the house was as tumultous as usual and transacted its initial business in such confusion as doubtless to lead any person witnessing for the first time the activities of that branch of the national congress to wonder how anything could be accomplished in such a bedlam. But despite the turmoil caused by more than four hundred members greeting each other after their nine months' vacation, the formalities were disposed of within two or three hours and the usual committee comprising the majority and minority leaders and the chairman of the appropriation committee was dispatched to the White House to inform the president to of of tut ttvv i i ♦ f* X)j •jjjj Now Is The Time To Provide Yourself with your Year's Supply of Papers and Magazines At the Usual Holiday Price Reduction—Pick out your Fav orite Offer and Send your Remittance to The Monitor NO. 1 I NO. 3 New York Thrice-a- Î week World .....................$1.00 f Farm, Stock & Home $ .50 Tlie Monitor........................... 2.00 | The Monitor........................... 2.00 _ - Total ...........................$3.00 Î Total..............................$2.50 All for $2.00 I All for $2.00 NO. 2 I NO. 4 ^outh 's Companion $2.00 % Pearson's Magazine $1.50 Tlie Monitor........................... 2.00 | The Monitor.......................... 2.00 ❖ - Total ..............................$4.00 î Total..............................$3.50 AU for $3.00 I All for $2.00 ****•—*—*—9*i**9****!**.**i—«—:*-^-:—*—*—*—*—*—*—:***— î**î—î* Most—if not all—of these Offers Expire on Jan. 1,1916—So, Send in Your Order at Once

MONT. *************** ************* ****** ********** I} 111 i i 11 mu mmm or to in ^ that congress was duly organized and ready to receive such communications as he desired to deliver to it More than ordinary interest attend ed the visit of the president to the capitol to deliver his annual message With more than half the world all top^ sy-turvy as a result of the war and our own country entangled to a cer tain extent in the violent upheaval which may yet draw us into the mael strom of that terrific conflict, the men who have to deal with the questions growing out of such an unprecedented conflict awaited with expectancy the recommendations of the nation's chief as to the course he would have them pursue. The setting was fully befitting the impressiveness of the occasion. With but very few exceptions, the members of the two houses, 533 of them, were in their seats in the great hall of the house. Members of the president's cabinet were also on the floor of the house. Representatives of many of the great nations of the world were seated in the diplomatic gallery and all of the other galleries were crowd ed to their capacity by those fortunate enough to secure the coveted tickets. Thousands of the less fortunate crowded the corridors and even the approaches to the capitol. As the president entered, escorted by a joint committee from the two houses, the members rose and gave him a most enthusiastic reception. Republicans joined the democrats in thus greeting the chief executive of the country. When the cheering had subsided somewhat, Speaker Clark brought down his heavy gavel and said: "Gentlemen of the senate and house of representatives, I present to you the president of the United States." It was the longest message that President Wilson has ever delivered to congress, consuming nearly an hour of time. Delivered without the slightest oratorical effort, every word of the message was easily heard in the most remote corners of the visit ors' galleries. Here and there the speaker was interrupted by outbursts of applause. Just once did the presi dent display an intensity of feeling and punctuate his words with vigor ous gestures and that was when he reached that portion of his address dealing with the conspiracies among certain individuals to humiliate and discredit the country of their adop M. 8, M. tion lish 1916. F. dive, tion. He clinched his fist and fairly snapped out the words as he urged that laws be enacted which will pro vide for the crushing out of such con spiracies. That his words fell upon sy mpathetic ears was demonstrated when a rumble of applause from the floor and gallery followed his incisive vehement excoriation of Americans whom he termed untrue to the vows of their citizenship. It was the one dramatic episode of an occasion which may become historic. The stage is now all set for the work of congress which is confronted with questions of greater moment than have been faced by any previous congress in half a century. There will be a few days of respite during which the machinery will be thor oughly perfected for a session which must almost inevitably run far into the summer. That it will be product ive of much illuminating discussion and not a little bitterness seems now assured. Knowing how vitally the people of our state must be interest ed in national affairs at this critical period of our history, I shall, as time and public duties permit, give through the medium of these letters, my own interpretation of events as they occur here at the seat of our national gov ernment.
