Friday last General William Lilly, Congressman -at-Ijtrj;e from this state, lied suddenly at his home in Mauch Chunk. The announcement of his death created great isurprise to all his neighbors and friends.

Jons 1'ai.mkk, the inventor of the rail way check system, died recently in a little town in Michigan. Many years ago he was a tiddler, and took charge of the hats and wraps of those who came to dancing parties. He gave numbered checks for them; and some railroad men who attended one of his dances appro priated the idea, and in a little while the system was adopted all over the country. William Lkwis. aged 17, of Youngs town, Ohio, while in the employ of the A merican tube and iron company, had his right arm caught in the machinery and cut off. He sued the company and secured a judgment for $G,(HK damages. The company carried Ithe case through the United states supreme court, which has dismissed its petition and affirmed the judgment. The lad will use the money in securing a college education. The great strike on the Lehigh Valley road was declared off at : o'clock on Wednesday morning, both sides making concessions. This action was the re sult of a conference between a joint com mittee, composed of members of the board of arbitration of New York and Mew Jersey, on one side, and I 'resident Wilbur, of the I high Valley road, on the other. The conference lasted three days, which was participated in by the i chiefs of the local and national labor : organizations who took purt in the i strike.

Claims to the amount of j raised the wagee of his employes be $ I,14 for salaries, te., are in sight, cause of an increase of duties' and it is more than likely that a consid erable additional amount will have to be paid, leaving but a small dividend for the stockholders. Tiik Democrats of the ways and means committee have acted wisely in deciding to take up the tariff bill on Monday next. It should have the first place on the calender and be pressed to a passage w ith no unnecessary delay. There is no occasion for a long debate. The whole subject has been discussed, in general and in detail, for the past six years. Talk in congress will change no member's vote. The country has had talk enough. There is no sense in ar guing after the verdict has been ren dered, iepeated and sustained by the tribunal of last resort. The reople have demanded a reform of the tariff. Their mandate should be obeyed. Business has a right to know as soon as Kissible what the changes are to be, says the Xew York V.'urLl. The Senate Finance committee has rec ognized the imjiortauce of despatch and will proceed with the consideration of the bill without waiting for its passing by the House. The time gained by the Organization of congress in August, which resulted in a carefully prepared bill before the ! meeting in regular session, ought to be j utilized now by a vigorous ouhinn- of i iLe measure to a final vote. J The message of the President to con gress, says the rhiludclphin i:rnl, is disappointing. It is a budget of inter esting recapitulations of mailers mainly within the public kaowlede; but it is extremely barren of original recommen dations. The 1'rcsidei.t ati.-t. s hiinsilf with statements of fad, leaving the in itiative of lcgi.-lutiou to cong:ss. For the reasons in support uf sti'h recom mendations as he d.KS make the reader of the me.-age will have to co isult the department reports. Full faith is given to the Il.'ount re port as otalilishing the forcible inter vention of the United States in ov r throwing the Hawaiian monarchy. The obligation of the 1'nited States to undo the wrong and restore as far as practica ble the status before existing is distinct ly asserted. The instructions given to Minister Willis are undisclosed. It is reassuring to he informed, however, that they do not go beyond the constitutional limits of executive power. This will re lieve apprehension lest the provisional government at Honolulu may have lccn toppled over by the direct pu.-h of Uni ted States marines. It is altogether pro-, liable that congress will lift the blanket covering the administration's Hawaiian policy, which the I'resident at present leaves undisturlied, awaiting additional advices for data for a special message on the subject. . On the financial tjuestion no positive recommendation is made, except that the President le empowered to iuvite other nations to a conference ou the subject of coinage when he shall deem the time rie for it; and that tiie author ity of the secretary of the treasury to issue bonds shall be made clear, un hampered by present disadvantageous regulations as to the rate of interest ami time of maturity. As to tariff reform, the President con tents himself with strong generalizations, descending no further to particulars than the indorsement of the bill prepared by the committee of ways and means. He gives the hint that in recasting internal revenue taxes a tax may be laid upon incomes derived from certain certiorate investments. In the House of Representatives on Monday the Hon. William II. Hines, a Democrat who represents the Twelfth Pennsylvania district, says the New York Sun, asked unanimous consent for the consideration of a resolution for the appointment of a committee of live members to investigate the strike on the Ix'high Valley Railroad. One of the duties of the proposed investigating commitee is to recommend legislation for the prevention of strikes, a com mission about as practical as an inquiry into the feasibility of perpetual motion. The Hon. Cutis tan tine Ruckloy Kilgore of Texas put his firm objecting foot upon Mr. Hines's resolution, and it was referred under the rules. Its projter destination would be the Committee on Ventilation and Acoustics. The interference of Congress in dis putes between railroads and their em ployees is usually inipi rtinent and al ways fruitless. Sin h interference gives an opportunity for demagogue cranks and agitators to air their buncombe. in the name of lhejowerto regulate com merce between the states. Ry consulting Mr. Cleveland's mes sage Mr. Hines will see that there will In' a deficiency of $:, 100,000 fl)r tj.

The monotony of this thing has grown tedious. The nation has repudiated it already, and members of congress must have even less than the average share of sense if they can be Stampeded by any such nonsense. This is a favorable opportunity to re duce wages, no doubt. There are a great many unemployed men and labor generally rates low in the market. As business revives it will be harder to get the right kind of help and employers may have to pay more. Put they will pay just as little as they can, whether the tariff I high or low, and' they might as well acknowledge the truth. Where the new taiiff is going to help labor is by allowing more constant em ployment and an enlarged demand. That will send wages up. Put the pre tense that wages are ever directly regu lated by the rate of duties is a trans parent mockery. Attorney Ciexkrai.

The R pub. leans w ho in ! disparagement of the bill saul it was j built upon the lines of the Walker tariff j of lS4i, could liardiy have given the bill greater praise, as the Waiker tariff was one of the IksI the country ever had, and the people of all classes were never more prosperous than while it was in existence-. President Cleveland has congratulated the I'enitM rals of the 'nu iti.m;; . conuiKltee upon the statesmanlike man- ner in w hich they prepared the tariff bill, in several instance nii iiiUis voting to put articles on the free list, such as iron ore, coal and silver lead or-, that their constituents would have preferred i having kept on the dutiable list and in his message to congress he will officially commend their work and urge that the bill le speedily passed. The Democrats of the committee 011 ways and means are now at work upon the internal revenue bill which is to fur nish the revenue that will be lost by re forming the tariff. It is estimated that this loss will le somewhere letwccn S.'JU, 000, OOO ami .."O.OiM 1,000 a year. The Democrats of the committee have but one thought in preparing, this bill, uid that is, to impose tin-taxes in such a manner that they will U ar the lightest upon those who have to work for their living, and as they are all men of w ide experience ami great ability they will 1 doubtless rejiort a satisfactorv bill. ... , -.1 Postmaster (ieneral Jlissel has not an nounced whether he considers it projier ami advisable to accept the bid submit ted by the Rureau of engraving ami printing for printing the postage stamps that will l; required next year, but the other fellows are getting frightened ami are tilling such of the local papers as are open to such subsidized matter with so-called arguments against the the gov ernment printing its own postage stamps. These arguments, which are but a repetition of those brought forward (when the people begun to discuss the question of the government printing its own money) by the agents of the various bank note companies which had grown rich by printing government currency. They ate siminy absurd, and if there are no legal obstacle.-it is probable that Jen. j Ri-sell will accept the hid of the Ruivail , of printing aud engraving, which is !
