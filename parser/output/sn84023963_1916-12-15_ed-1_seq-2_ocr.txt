LIBERTY'S NEW LIGHT Famous Statue in New York Harbor Shines Anew. President Wilson Touches Wireless Key for the Big Illumination Battleships Fire Salute. New York, Dec, 4. The statue of liberty was illuminated from torch to base at the dedication of a permanent lighting system. President Wilson gave the signal for turning on the lights. Jules Jusserand, the French ambassador; Secretary Daniels of the navy, Secretary Redfield of the depart ment of commerce and many other prominent men attended the ceremony. The illumination, which will be a nightly feature of the historic goddess of welcome, was paid for by popular subscription. President Wilson, accompanied by Mrs. Wilson, secretary Tumulty and Dr. Cary T Grayson, was met by Mayor MItcLel and a committee of 200 citizens and escorted to a landing stage on the North river, where the presi dent boarded the presidential yacht Mayflower. The French ambassador, Mme. Jusserand and James W. Gerard, ambassador to Germany, were guests on the Mayflower. Secretary Daniels, Secretary Itedfield and the members of the mayor's committee were aboard the warships San Francisco and Yank ton. Headed by the Mayflower, the official craft steamed downstream and anchored off Bedloe's island at 5:45, surrounded by several battleships of the Atlantic fleet. Then President Wilson touched a wireless key and began a message or dering the statue illuminated. A rocket was fired from the Mayflower at the eame time.

CONGRESS HEARS WILSON'S MESSAGE President's Address to Both Houses Is Quite Short. RAIL TROUBLES COME FIRST Further Legislation on That Line Is Strongly Recommended Bill Giv ing Foreign Commerce Promo ters Free Hand Necessary. "Washington, Dec. 5. President Wil son today delivered his message to both houses of congress in joint ses sion. The address was as follows : Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the Constitution of com municating to you from time to time information of the state of the Union and recommending to your considera tion such legislative measures as may be judged necessary and expedient I shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general pub lic policy with which it seems neces sary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug gestions as few as possible; but there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public to do at once. In the first place, it seems to me im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated difficulties which then existed, and which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended : First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the bill recently passed by the house of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate ; in order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon it with a prompt ness and thoroughness which are, with its present constitution and means of action, practically impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the employ ment of all railway employees who are actually engaged in the work of oper ating trains in interstate transporta tion. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re sults in experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day in railway trans portation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the in terstate commerce commission of an increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed justify the increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, in case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment In the hands of the executive of the power, in case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use. Renews His Recommendations. The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress immediate ly acted on: it established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wages in train service and it au thorized the appointment of a com mission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most Immediately needed; but it postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate con sideration of them. The fourth rec ommendation I do not deem it neces sary to renew. The power of the In terstate commerce commission to grant an increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the com mission's authority or its Inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions the increase in the Interstate commerce commis sion's membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing. Those who have intrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them in such matters would find it hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does the interstate com merce commission now find it practi cally impossible, with its present mem bership and organization, to perform its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrativ instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make Immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the increase in the effi ciency of the Interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives has already acted ; its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue In an employment which he de Sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in do ing so would be to adopt a new prin ciple into our jurisprudence which I take it for granted we are not prepared to introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the in dustrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between em ployee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider all practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbi trary or unjust in it unless it be arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupu lous regard for the interests and liber ties of all concerned as well as for the pernurhent interests of society itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in pro moting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bill amending the present organic law of Porto Rico ; and the bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, com monly called the Corrupt Practices Act I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies in the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time. not only opportune but neces sary. Even delnv would sArimKiv jeopard the interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg ulate the expenditure of money in elec tions may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer; be cause at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral offices are to be filled ; but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience; and a delay would have the further very se rious disadvantage of postponing ac tion until another election was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. I shall not argue at length the desir ability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enteroHs nf hnflrif nr nn mir export trad. That enterprise rill presently, will immediately assume, has Indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary Instrumen talities for its prosecution; it is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Needs, The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it Is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this is. gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you in the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country It has been a privilege to labor in such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare serviceableness and distinction. Bound to Make Good. The well-dressed stranger stepped into the drug store and, passing by the boy who usually attended to casual customers, approached the proprietor, who was arranging some goods in the show case. "Mr. C , I presume?" he re marked, pleasantly, and the druggist turned and bowed gravely. "I have heard my friend, Mr. Quorn, speak of you often," said the brisk man. "He told me If ever I needed anything in this line to come to you. He spoke of you as a man on whom one could rely with perfect confidence, who had only the best of evrything and with whom It was always a pleasure to deal." "Mr. Quorn is very kind;" answered the other, beaming with gratification. "He is one of by best customers. What can I do for you this morning?" "Well er this morning, as it hap pens," said the stranger, with just a little briskness, "this morning I should like, if you will allow me, to consult your directory." "Certainly," was the calm reply. "We also have a good selection of one and two-cent stamps as well as railway time tables, if you need anything of that kind." Franklin Objects Seriously. She isn't very large, that's true, but being a county seat, and boasting of a college, several factories, flour mills, railways, interurhans and her lately acquired Masonic home, Franklin feels that she is not a town to be passed lightly by, in fact, she knows her im portance, and thought that everyone in the state realized it until she was taken down a bit lately. During the big conference of the Methodist churches held recently in the town a meeting of the Indianapolis presbytery was in session at the same time at Hopewell, a country church in a pros perous farming community a few miles out. One of the Presbyterian delegates, on leaving the train joined in the throng headed for the Method ist church. When it came to regis tering, some of his inquiries caused someone to suggest that probably he was in the wrong place, and he asked innocently: "Isn't this Hopewell?" "No, this is Franklin," was the proud reply. Indianapolis News. Rather Embarrassing. Irvin Cobb, the war correspondent, home from Europe long enough recent ly to get his breath and look over the proof sheets of a new book, attended an authors' banquet in New York. A deaf man sat next to Cobb. Far ther down the table another man told a funny story, and when he finished, the deaf man laughed and applauded louder and longer than any of the rest. "Good old boy!" shouted the deaf man. "That reminds me of a story," he added to those near by. "Get up and tell it, Charlie," cried several. The toastmaster sanctioned the suggestion. Then the deaf man got up and told the same story the other man had told. He Was on the Job. The undertaker arose and said to the mourners assembled: "If anyone present wishes to say a few words of tribute to the deceased, now is the time, when the family will be glad to hear such." A stillness prevailed, and after a few moments of silence it was broken by a young man, who arose and asked : "Do I understand that no one wishes to make any remarks?" "It would appear so," replied the undertaker. "Then," asked the young man, as a light came into his eyes, "may I be permitted to make a few remarks about southern California and ita woa- dexful climate?" I Indiana les Bicknell. John E.
