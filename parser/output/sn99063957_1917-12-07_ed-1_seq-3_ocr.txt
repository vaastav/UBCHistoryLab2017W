B. Bouquet, chief of vege , ' table gardening at O. A. C. gave a very interesting and instructive address on the subject of growing vegetables for canneries and exaporatbrs. Prof. Bouquet stated that with present con .. ditious existing in the world for pros- pects for good markets for this line ' of produce were very promising. Bar ' lein, with its several canneries and evap orators and the soil on which, to grow the produce, is one of the best if not the best section of the state for this branch of industrial activity and the extent to which "it might be developed is practically unlimited. Brown Beads Paper. County Agriculturist 1 E. Brown read an interesting paper on "Orchard . Heredity and fertilizers ". Mr.' Brown stated that in addition to soil fertility we must .also consider more carefully the question of soil management, be cause any attempt to increase product ' ivity thru the use of fertilizers must fall short of its greatest attainment if the physical condition of the soil is not made the best possible. "There are two important factors in plant growth," said Mr. Crown. "These factors are the plants 'home' ' and its 'food', both of which are large ly under the control of the orchardist. President Paulus referred yesterday to the fact that many orchards were be ing pulled out because of unsuitable lo cations. Every orchardist knows that h host home for a fruit tree is in a deep, well drained soil, into which air I fruit pit of the apple, is apparently not caused by any disease organism and offers very little chance of control. ' ' Memorial Services for Williamson . Memorial services were held yester day afternoon for H. N. Williamson, who died recently and who was one of the pioneers in the horticultural work of the state. H. B. Miller, of Eugene, presided over the service and paid a glowing tribute to the departed member of the society. Eulogies were pronounc ed by Governor Withycombe and Col onel Henry E. Dosch. The memorial was read by Charles A. Parks, of Salom, president of the state board of horti culture. Governor's Address. Governor Withycombe in addressing the members of the society, said: "I am glad to be here and to wel come you. It is a great moment for men to do things. It is the men who have vision and courage, that survive difficulties when dark clouds hang above. "I remember the first meetings this association held in this city some years ago. There are but a few of those at tending that meeting who are here tq; day. I believe Mr. Park and Senator LaPollotte are the only ones here to day, "To my mind this is the time of all times when we should stand with the horticultural industry. The main reason is that the fruit of the soil are very important "and it is a patriotic duty to come forth with a supreme effort to produce all we can from the soil. "There is at this Mime a tremen dous opportunity for the loganberry prowers. Approximately $180,000 has been spent in furthering that industry, and if we. are goings to Teap tne nar- THE

"A few years ago the apple men of the northwest were appalled at the ravages of a new disease. For a time it seriously threatened the fruit indus try of Hood Eiver and was the cause of a heavy annual loss in many other sections. This disease for a time seemed to defy all methods of control and since no defiuite organisms could be found that would account Sor its action, there seemed to be no way of combating it. For many years the common practice of those orehardists was. clean cultiva tion. Little or no attention was paid to replacing the plant food which was annually-taken out of the soil by the crops. Since then cover crops and shade crops have generally been substituted for clean cultivation and the disease has passed, at least to the extent that it is no longer a serious problem, "At the present time the prune men are facing the fact that the older or chards have almost ceased to be profit able. Most of these orchards are now past 15 years of age and have suddenly ceased bearing profitable crops. In ad dition to this fact a thing which is more serious, if possible, than the de creasing production, is the steady in creasing amount of certain physiological troubles which are now found in many of the. orchards. I refer particularly to the browning of the prune at the pit, a thing which seriously injures the qual ity of the dried product. It, like the By morning, most if not all, of your dandruff will be gone, .and three or four more applications will completely 'dissolve and entirely destroy every singlo sign and trace of it, no matter how much dandruff you may have. You will find, too, that all itching and digging of the scalp will stop in stantly, and your hair will be fluffy, lustrous, glossy, silky and soft, -and look and feel a hundred times better. You can get liquid arvon at any drug store. It is inexpensive, and four ounc es is all you wiE need.

There are ten to 15 millions of acres in the central-western counties of Oregon and some localities in Washington adapted to the growth of loganberries.

In those days it was feared that the palace might be bombed at any time. On the floor below KerenBky's quarters a fire broke out that, for a time, threatened to destroy the left wing of the palace. But still Kerensky, who had every reason to fear for his life, to fear of being murdered in his rooms, stood pat and refused to surrender to Kor- niloff. Each day as the Jornilof f - troops eamenearer to Petrograd, Kerensky grew bolder and bolder. He sent out de fies, by wireless; he issued statements to the press; he ordered Korniloff 's ar rest. He sent out troops, in whom he could have had little confidence to meet the Korniloff forces and he sent out three miles of freight cars and loco motives to block the railway near Tszarsky Selo. He closed down the big gest newspapers in Kussia. w nen rne troops oi me ih-ih-i u BIG RAILWAY LOAN OR FEDERAL DICTATOR FOR NAWS ROADS Decision Up To President Who Is Wcighfag Situation Carefully Today . Washington, Dec. 7. Government! operation of railroadsMiung in-the bal ance today. On President Wilson de- ponded whether the government should loan the railways one billion dollars Or put them under a federal dictator to end the war freight jam. Some congressmen looked for the president to seize control of the rail roads before Christmas. They predict ed that legislation for unification of the lines would mean a long delay. The president desires immediate relief from raAlroacV (Congestion. Under authority ne already possesses, he could place every mile of track under federal con trol by a pen's stroke. lhe four railroad brotherhoods are united with the railway executives against government control. President Wilson is understood to have been told this when the labor leaders saw him recently regarding their wage demands The brotherhoods favor financial and legislative aid to the carriers to enable them to unify their operations a sug gested by the interstate commerce commission under direction of a war board. The railroad executives today were preparing estimates of the amount needed for 1918 to place the lines on a war efficiency basis. These estimates are to be submitted to Senator New lands for presentation by him to the president on Monday. The president is shortly afterward expected to make; known his views, possibly in a special message to congress. Legislators said they would follow the president's recommendations. One senator, a labor sponsor, even said ho would vote for an anti-strjke bill if the president wished it, although, in the senator's opinion, such legislation "might precipitate a labor revolu tion." Acting Chairman Sims of the house interstate commerce committee, favors immediate action by the president to seize the railroads. ' "Then he could come to congress for supplemental legislation to guarantee railroad securities or whatever meas ures were advisable," said Sims. "It would take six months to take cheers for every victor in civil war. The Kronstadt sailors, who had caus ed the bloody massacre in July, au who had guarded Kerensky and the winter Palace during Korniloff advance seemed to worship him. Kerensky had Korniloff arrested. And yet, though he had been willing to risk his own life in the venture, he declin ed to take the life of Korniloff. Today it is dear that twice he made this mis take of refusing to punish traitors. He; had permitted the bloodsheduing radi cals, Lenine and Trotsky to go free. And now he permitted the would-be blood letting Korniloff to escape punishment. In Petrograd, the Leniuites, whom he had not punished, and the aristocratic officers of the Korniloff regime, whom he "also had not punished, joined hands and forced Kerensky to bis downfall. the interstate commerce commission 's recommendations for unification under the railroads' own control."
