Renewed Interest was attached to the Khjf?1) reopening of the Lexow Committee's H7u7 esslon to-day, by the fact that Father I ft Pucey was among the auditors. police protection, but he wanted to hear something for himself, and In this way get a belter Idea of American Instltu lions. He told an "Evening World" reporter that he thought New York a fine city and admired Us big buildings. Senator Cantor arrived Just before the Committee was called to order at 11.30. Mr. Burns was Introduced to the Sen ators by Mr. Gompers. They greeted him very cordially and Invited him to a seat upon the bench, which he accepted. Mr. Jerome, who has been so much en gaged with the affairs ofthe, L.XX. that he could not attend the hearings before election, was In his old place again. The conference of Mr. doff with Chair man Lexow lasted until nearly noon. Many guesses were hazarded as to the cause of the delay, and Mr. Qoft finally said he was walling for an Important witness whom he had expected to be present. . .

Then Chairman Lexow rapped for order and announced that he had re ceived a letter from Street - Cleaning Commissioner W. S. Andrews requesting a copy of the testimony given at the last sessions regarding his actions while In the Excise Board, lie had referred this letter to Mr. doff. Mr. Goff stated that he had been In communication with Commissioner An drews and had Informed htm that while he did not think It proper to furnish him with a copy of the testimony taken, he had offered to give him the first op portunity this morning to present the vindication he desired. "I understand that Commissioner An drews Is before the Board of Estimate and Apportionment this morning and cannot attend, so I have extended the invitation till to-morrow." Answered for Evelyn Hell. Mr. Qoff then said he proposed to take up some unfinished business and cases that had been left over from the last cession of the Committee. He asked that the name of Evelyn Bell be called. A woman In the crowd stood up. v "That's not Evelyn Bell," said Mr. Qoff. "Call her again." The call was repeated, but no response was given, and at Mr. Goff's request the counsel was Instructed to bring the case of the Bell woman to the attention of the Grand Jury.

"Well he ought to know," said Chair man Lexow. " Don't you know Mr. Wit ness that this Is a pretty serious matter for you?" he asked, turning to Lewis, who shook his head. " Well, you can be sent to State prison .for fifteen years for the offense you say you committed." " 1 didn't think I waa doing anything wrong.

Lewis said he never saw a bar at the Malson Fortunl. His affidavit stated that the hotel had twenty-nine rooms, had been licensed for ten years, and that Mme. Chande had retired. Lewis said he never knew anything about the rooms or how long the place had been licensed. Certainly Mme.

The next witness called was Michael Ryan, a searedlooklng man, with a pointed gray beard. " Why did you disobey the subpoena of this Committee last Summer?" asked Mr. Qoff. " I never did," protested the witness. " I was never served. A man came to my house one morning and threw a pa per In the door. I was in my night Shirt. " He came to my door and asked me If I was Michael Ryan, and I said Mr. Ryan sometimes came there and shut the door. He threw the paper In and it fell on the floor' Q Didn't he tell you that It was a aubpoena for you, Mtkt Ryan, and put It In your hands? A. No, air.

The Differential Tax on Re- fine! Sugar Should Be Bepealedt CHANGES IN BANKING LAWS. More Liberal Legislati.n fir Banks Would Solve the Currency Quostl.n. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-The Presi dent's message was laid before the two houses of Congress soon after assem bling. It is as follows: To the Congress of the United States: The assemblage within the nation's leg islative halls of those charged with the duty of making laws for the benefit of a generous and free people impressively suggests the exacting obligation and In exorable responsibility involved In their tark. At the threshold cf such labor now to bo undertaken by the Congress of tho United States, and In the dis charge of an executive duty enjoined by tho Constitution, I submit this communi cation, containing a brief statement of tho condition ot our National affairs, and recommending such legislation as stems to mo necessary and expedient. The history of our recent dealli.gs with other nations, and our peaceful relations with them at this time, additionally dem onstrate the advantage ot consistently adhering to a firm but Just foreign pol icy, free from envious or ambitious Na tional schemes and characterized by en tire honesty and .sincerity. f v During- the past-ycar. pursuant io a law of Congress, commissioners were appointed to the Antwerp. Industrial Exposition. '"Though the ' participation of American exhibitors fell far short of completely Illustrating, our National In genuity and Industrial achievements, yet It was quite creditable In view of the brief time allowed for preparation. I have endeavored to Impress upon the Belgian Government the needless ncss and positive harmfulness of Its restrictions upon tho Importation of cer tain of our food products, and have strongly urged that the rigid supervision and Inspection under our laws are amply sufficient to prevent the exportation from this country of diseased cattle and unwholesome meat. The termination of the civil war In Brazil has been followed by tbe general ..revalence of peace and order. Jt ap pearing at an early stage of the insur rection that Its course would call for un usual watchfulness on the part of this Government, our naval force In the har bor of Rio de Janeiro was strengthened. This precaution, I am satisfied, tended to restrict the Issue to a simple trial of strength between the Brazilian Govern ment and the Insurgents, and to avert complications which at times seemed Im minent. Our firm attitude of neutrality was maintained to the end. The Insur gents received no encouragement of eventual asylum from our commanders, and such opposition as they encoun tered was for the protection of our com merce and was clearly Justified by public law. A serious tension ot relations having arisen at the close of the war between Brazil and Portugal, by reason of the escape of i!.e Insurgent Admiral da Gama and his followers, the friendly offices of our representatives to those countries were exerted for the protec tion of the subjects ot either within the territory of the other. Although the Government of Brazil was duly notified that the commercial arrangement existing between the United States and that country, based on the third section of the Tariff act of 1S90, was abrogated on Aug. 28, 1891, by the taking effect of the Tariff law now in force, that Government subse quently notified us of Its Intention to terminate such arrangement on the first day of January, 1895, In the exercise ot the right reserved In the agreement between the two countries. I Invite attention to the correspondence between the Secretary ot State and the Brazilian Minister on this subject. The Commission organized under the convention which we had entered Into with Chile for the settlement of the oustandlng claims of each Government against the other, Adjourned at the end of the, period stipulated for Its continu ance, leaving undetermined a number of American cases which had been duly presented. These claims are not barred and negotiations are In progress for their submission to-a new tribunal. 

THEITY WITH CHINA. On the 17th of March last, a new tteaty with China In further regulation of emigration was signed at Washing ton, and on Aug. 13, It received the sanction of the Senate. Ratification on. the part ot China and formal' exchange are awaited to give effect to this mu tually beneficial convention. A' gratifying recognition ot the uni form Impartiality of this country towards all foreign States was mani fested by the coincident request ot the Chinese and Japanese Governments, that the agents of the United States should, within proper limits, afford protection to the subjects pf the other during the suspension of- dlptematlo relation due to a state ot war. This deHeate office DR. CLEVELAND The other medicine didn't work as well as I expected, but I'm sure this will fetch you1 around all right. was accepted, and a misapprehension which gave rise to the belief that In affording thlsklndly unofficial protection our agents would exercse tho same au thority which the withdrawn agents of the belllgorents had exercised, was promptly corrected. Although the war between China and Japan endangers no policy of the United States, It deserves our gravest consideration, by reason ot Its disturbance of our growing commer cial Interests in the two countries and the Increased dangers which may re sult to1 our citizens domiciled or so journing In the Interior ot China. Acting under a stipulation In our treaty, with Corea (the first concluded with a Western power) I felt constrained At the beginning of the controversy to tender our . good offices to Induce an amicable arrangement of" the Initial dif ficulty growing out of ths Japanese de mands for administrative reforms In Corea; but the unhappy precipitation of actual hostilities defeated this kindly purpose. Deploring the destructive war between the two most powerful of the Eastern I nations and anxious that our commer cial Interests In those countries may bo preserved and that the safety of our citizens there shall not be Jeopardized, I 'would not hesitate to heed any Intima tion that our friendly aid for the honor able termination of hostilities would bo acceptable to both belligerents. A convention has been finally concluded for the settlement by arbitration of the prolonged dispute with Ecuador growing out of the proceedings against Emlllo Santos, a naturalized citizen of the United States. Our relations with the .Republic of France continue to be such as should exist between nations so long bound to gether by friendly sympathy and simi larity In their form of government. The recent cruel assassination of the President ot this sitter Republic called forth such universal expressions of sor row and condolence from our people and Government as to leave no doubt of'the depth and sincerity of our attachment. The resolutions passed by the Senate and House of Representatives on the oc casion have been communicated to the widow of President Carnot, Acting upon the reported discovery of Texas fever in cargoes of American cat tle, the German prohibition against Im portations of live stock and freih meats from this country has been revived. It Is hoped that Germany will soon become convinced that the inhibition Is as need less as It Is harmful to mutual Interests. 

REPEALING nlSCIUJII.VATlNG DU TIES. The German Government has protested against that provision of the customs tariff act which Imposes a discriminating duty ot one-tenth of one cent a pound on sugars coming from countries paying an export bounty thereon, claiming that the exaction of such duty is In contra vention of articles five and nine of tho treaty of 1828 wth Prusala. In the Interests of the commerce of both countries and to avoid even the accusation ot treaty violation, I recom mend the repeal of so much of the statute as Imposes that duty, and I In vite attention ' to the accompanying report of the Secretary of State contain ing a discussion of the questions raised by the German protests. F.nriv in th nresent vear an agree ment was reached with Great Britain concerning Instructions to be given to the naval commanders of the two gov ernments in Uehring Sea and the con tiguous North Pacific Ocean, for their guidance In the execution ot the award of the Paris Tribunal of Arbitration and the enforcement of the regulations therein prescribed, for tbe protection of seal life in the waters mentioned. An understanding has also been reached for the. payment by the United States of Jta.Mo. In full satisfaction of a, I claims which may be made by Oreat Britain for damages growing out of the controversy as to fur seals In Uehring Sea, or tbe seizure of British vessels engaged in taking seal In those waters. The award and findings of the Paris Tribunal to a great extent determined the facts and principles upon which these clslms should be adjusted, and they have been subjected by both gov ernments to a thorough examination upon the principles as well as the facts which they Involve. I am convinced that a settlement upon the terras jnen. tloned would be an equitable and ad vantageous one and I recommend that provision be made for the prompt pay ment of the statedsum. Thus far, only France and Portugal have signified their willingness to ad here to the regulations established under the award ot the Parts Tribunal of Arbitration. ... ,, , Preliminary survey of the Alaskan boundary and a .preparatory examina tion ot the qfmUm- QtprotectloB ot 9" ' t 2 - food-fish In the contiguous waters of the United States and the Dominion or Canada are In progress.

Prominent among the questions of the year vbs the UluefleldVi Incident, tn what Is known as the Mosquito Indian Strip, bordering on the Atlantic Ocean and within the Jurisdiction of Nicaragua Hy the treaty of 1880 between Great Britain and Nicaragua th former Government expressly recog.ilzed the sovereignty of the latter over the Strip, and a limited form of self-government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians, to be exercised according to tnelr customs, for them selves and other dwellers within its Units. The so-called native Government, which grew to Le largely made up ot aliens, for many years disputed the sov ereignty of Nicaragua over the Strip and claimed the right to maintain there in a practically Independent municipal government. Early In the past year ef forts of Nicaragua to maintain sov ereignty over the Mosquito territory led to serious disturbances culminating In the suppression of the native Govern ment and h attempted substitution ot an Impracticable composite admlnstra- .. . .......

Although the alien Interests arrayed against Nicaragua in these transactions have been largely American, and the commerce of that region for some time has been and still is chiefly controlled by our citizens, we cannot for that reason challenge the rightful sover eignty of Nicaragua over this Important part of her domain. ... For some months one, and during part of the time two, of our naval ships have been station at Ulueflelds for the protection ot all legitimate Interests of our citizens. In September last tho Government at Managua expelled from Its territory twelve or more foreigners. Including two Americans, for alleged participation In the seditious or revo lutionary movements against the re Eubllc at Blueflelds already mentioned: ut through the earnest remonstrance of this Government the two Americans have been permitted to return to the Beaceful management of their business. iur naval commanders at the scene of these disturbances, by their constant exhibition of firmness and good Judg ment, contributed largely to the pre vention of more serious consequences and. to the restoration of quiet and (Continued on Third Page-) HIS SLAP AT FELLOWS. s Ingraham Would Not Oonveno the Extraordinary Graad Jnry.

In the Court of Oyer' and Terminer, threw a bombshell Into the District Attorney's office. He very curtly told the Grand Jury that he would not have any use for the members at all until he could get a special Deputy Attorney-General ft) pre sent to their notice such matters as were In his mind for them to Investigate. t aeemaw. ffes9BBSBvaBaVtavejeriSsJC Jl'DGE 1NQIUIIAU. He said, more by Inference than di rectly, that he could not trust the District-Attorney to Investigate the matters he had In mind, and which. It was quite plain to Infer, meant the Investigation of the District-Attorney's office. Forty-four gentlemen had answered to their names as thsse from whom the Grand Jury was to be chosen. As soon as they hod answered they were called to the lnclosure In front of the bench, and Judge Ingraham began by saying: "I un requested to state to you, gentle mer,, tint this Grand Jury may have to sit long r than December." Then there was a pause, during which Judge Ii.graham talked privately to one or two of the talesmen. Col. Fellowr and Assistant District-Attorneys Mclntyre, Townsend, Battle, Lindsay and Hennessey sat Inside the rail. Turning to the talesmen, who had not yet been sworn In, Justice Ingraham said: "Gov. Flower was requested by the Committee of Seventy to appoint a Depu ty Attorney-General to attend upon this Grand Jury, especially convened this month to Inquire Into certain matters which are to be laid before them. "The District-Attorney concurred In that request, and I mselt wrote to Al bany to have the appointment made. I am convinced that, without a Deputy Attorney-General to prosecute these cases, the Investigation and matters I have tn mind to lay before you cannot be successful. "I shall not lay the matters before you at this time, therefore, but shall ask iou to come here on the first Monday In Jan uary, when we will have with us, to assist us tn the the Investigation you shall be called upon to make, a Deputy Attorney-Genetaf. "I shall leave the responsibility for the delay with those who are in power and are in a position to put this matter "Come, then, on the first Monday In January to this Court, and I shall lay the matters I have In mind before yThe talesmen filed out and Col. Fellows followed them with a puzzled expression on his face. It was certain that he bad not expected anything of the kind, for he had already designated his assist ants to attend to the Extraordinary a rand Jury, and those assistants be lieved, up to the time that Judge In graham dismissed the a rand Jury for a month, that they would begin their WMkwa?1aaid afterwards at the DIs-trict-Attorney' office that tho action of Judge Ingraham certainly means that (Continued on Second Pag.) e , -.kiir.
