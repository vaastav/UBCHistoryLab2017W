Congress assembled in regular ses sion Inst Monday and the President's message was read before both Houses on that day. The message is lengthy and common place with a few exceptions. As usual wttn modern executives considerable space is tak en up iu exploiting the beauties of the civil service humbug. Consider- aple space is devoted to deploring the enormous amount of seed sent out through the agricultural bureau. The two points of general interests is the Hawaiian matter and the tariff. About the former, after recounting the fact of a treaty made under the Harrison administration, the Presi dent says : ' This treaty I withdrew for exami nation and sent James II. Blount of Georgia to Honolulu as a special commissioner to make an impartial investigation of the circumstances at tending the change of government and of all the conditions bearing up on the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination Mr. Blount submitted to me his re port, showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representatives to thnt govern men tj and through the intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the Unit ed States, which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our minis ter. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us aud to restore as far as practicable the stat us existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accom plishing-this result within the consti tutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities growing out of any changed conditions brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has re ceived appropriate instructions to that end. As to the tariff he approves the Wilson bill and says : It is the result of much patriotic and unselfish work, and I believe it deals with its subject consistently and as thoroughly as existing conditions per mit. I am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed legislation, added to existing internal revenue taxation, will, in the near fu ture, though perhaps not immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government 5 President Cleveland's message, like the Wilson tariff bill, receives much praise from Canadian and English sources. Van Alen, Cleveland's 60,0C0 Ambassador to Italy, declines the honor on account of the stench it has raised. The country can stand it. It begins to look as if "Paramount" Blount and Grover Cleveland would go into history as two of a kind par mobile fratrum. However Blount has a little the advantage this is the second time he has tried to pull down the American flag. - Uncle Sam has a big stock of slight ly shop-worn Columbian stamps on baud, but the present Postmaster General not being a believer in bargain-counters they will not be sold at a reduction ; but they will be sold all the same, as an order has been issued to furnish no others to postmasters until they are all sold. There's more than one way to make the public buy an undesirable thing. The Manchester (England) Courier says that the Willson bill is "much more thorough than the most sanguine people on this side ventured to an ticipate." As a result of the proposed n&w tariff bill mills are shutting down aud wages are being reduced all over the country. How many times, have we been told that the tariff had nothing to lo with wages ? Facts are stub born things, aren't they ? A bright metropolitan editor says, speaking of a double suicide : "From all indications the tragedy was prompted chiefly by a morbid mental condition." If given an opportunity that editor would discover that water runs down bill when it rains real hard. Bub lugersoll is said to be think ing of bringing out a Dew lecture on the "Blunders of Blount," to take the place of the "Mistakes of Moses," which he has worn somewhat threadbare. A

" The Philadelphia Ledger contaius an interesting interview on the new tariff bill with Colonel Charles II. Banes, a prominent Democratic bus inees man of the Quaker City, and a former Democratic candidate for Congress. In this interview Colonel Baues, who stigmatizes the Cleveland Wilson bill as a "hybrid" which "sud denly disturbs with ruthless hands the economic conditions of a genera tion," also describes a conversation which he had with Chairman Wilson of the Ways and Means Committee when the bill was in course of prepa ration. "I affirmed," Colonel Banes declares, "that the reduction contem plated would fall most heavily upon the laboring classes. Mr. Wilson's reply was to the effect that, as 'our American workmen are better housed, clothed and fed, they could do more work for the same wages than foreign ers.'" This is the whole case in a nutshell ! The fundamental and controlling prin ciple of the new tariff scheme is that American workingmen shall "work for the same wages" as the foreign pauper labor that lives in a hovel aud dies in an almshouse. The theory that the wage earners of the United States are mere beasts of burden, who can be forced to do much more work under the spur of impending starva tion than they do now, or than the labor of Europe performs; is a pet doctrine of the free traders. What do the workingmen of America, whose wages, homes and manhood are threat ened, by the overthrow of protection, think of this proposition ? Are they willing to staud idly by and allow American wages to be cut down one half without reibtance ? New York Press. Canada is delighted with the Wilson tariff bill. The Toronto' Globe . de clares that "the free list Is most com prehensive" and is "advantageous to Canadians." The Montreal Herald asserts that "our trade with the Uni ted States) which has been rapidly falling off for the last teu years, will pick up wonderfully if the Wilson bill becomes a law." Tbe'Montreal Gazelle acknowledges that "Canada's interest in the measure is somewhat extensive," and publicly boasts that "it is evident that the fact was not forgotten by the framers of the bill Ilia Text.

Sun saysxf the pres ident's nessage : Mr. Cleveland de votes more space to what he regards as an excessive purchase of seeds of the department of agriculture than the momentous enterprise of throne building which he has undertake!) iu Hawaii. He devotes almost as inanv words to the condition of the North American Indian tribes as to the tariff, which occupied all of his thoughts in 1887 and has become in 1893 an affair not merely of promises but of performance. For these rea sons it may be fairly criticised as un satisfactory in its range, if not act ually evasive iu its intention. The personal note sounds at usual throughout the message.

Cutts, of Orwell, the su perintendent of the State Morgan ex hibit, aud with the officials of the Vermont Merino Sheep-Breeders' As sociation, uuder the auspices of which exhibits of fine wool sheep were sent. Mr. Mclntire said after he had finish ed his business that the Morgan ex hibitors would receive about 30 per ceut. of the premiums taken by their horses, and the exhibitors of sheep about 60 per cent. The entire cost of the Vermont Morgan horse exhibit at the fair was about $2350, of which the State paid $1800. It was under btood that the remaiuiug expenses would be paid out of premiums, and if this was insufficient, the balance would be paid by the horse-breeders. The baluuee of the expense, after the payment of the State's $1800, is $550, and as the premiums received amount ed to $825, there remaius about $275 to be distributed to such exhibitors as draw premiums. The sheep exhibit cost $1100, of which the Stale paid $1000. The winnings of Vermont sheep were about $410. The Ayr shire and Jersey cattle exhibits each cost the State about $'J00. Compe tition in these classes was heavy, be tween 200 and 300 cattle being exhi bited in each class. The amount of premiums to any State or locality was therefore correspondingly small.
