II J i II Twenty-Second Year. Hock Island, Illinois, Tuesday December 3, 1872. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Washington, Deo. 2. CONGRATULATORY. To the Senate and Boom of Representative: In transmitting- to' you my fourth an nual message, it u with thankfulness to the Giver of all good that as a nation we have been blessed for the last year with peace at home and abroad, and a general prosperity vouchsafed to but few people. With the exception of the recent devas tating tire which swept from the earth with a breath as it were millions of accu mulated wealth in the city of Hop ton there have beenno over shadowing calum nies within the year to record .It ii grat ifying to note how like their fellow oitneni ot the oity of Chicago under similar cir cumstances a year earlier, the citiaens of Hoston are rallying under their misfor tune and the prospect is that their energy and perseverance will overcome all obsta cles and aliow the same prosperity soon that they would had no disaster befallen theui. Otherwise we have been free from pestilence, war and calamities which often overtake nation, and as far as human judgment can penetrate the fu ture, no cause seems to exist to threaten our present peace. 

TREATY OF WASHINGTON. When Congress adjourned in June last a question had been raised by Great Brit am and was then pending which for a time seriously imperilled the settlement bv friendly arbiitration of the differences existing between this government and that of her Brittanio Majesty, but the treaty of Washington had been referred to the tribunal ot arbitration which had met at Geneva, in Switierland. The arbitrators, however, disposed of the question which had jeopardised the whole of the treaty and threatened to in volve the two nations in most unhappy relations toward each other in a manner entirely satisfactory to this government sod in accordance with the views and the policy which it had maintained. The tribunal which had convened in Geneva in Ieoeinber concluded its laborious ses sion on the 14th duyot September last, on which bodv having availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to awaid a sum in gross, made its decision whereby it awarded the sum of $15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the United States for the satisfaction of all the claims referred to its consideration. This decision happily disposes of a long stand ing difference between the governments and in connection with another award made by the German Emperor under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves the two coverments without a shadow upon the friendly relations which it is uiy sincere hope may forever remain equally un clouded. The report of the atrent of the United States appointed to attend the Geneva tribunal accompanied by the proetocol ot the proceedings of the arbitration, the arguments of the council ot both Gov ernments, the award of the tribunal and the opinions given by the several arbitra tor, "is transmitted herewith. 1 have caused to be communieated to the heads of the three friendly powers who compli ed with the joint request made to them under the treaty, the thanks of this Gov ernment tortbe appointment oi theaibitra tors made by them respectively and also my thanks to the eminent personages Darned by them and my appreciation ot' the dignity, patience, impartiality and great ability with which they discharged t heir arduous and high functions. Her Majesty 'sgovernment communicated tome the recognition by her Majesty of the ability and indefatigable industry display ed by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named on. the part of this Government,duhnic the protracted inquiries and discussions of the tribunal. 1 cordially unite with ber Maj esty in this appreciation. It is due to the aifent of the United States before the tribunal to record my appreciation of the marked ability, the patience, the prudence and discretion with which lie has conducted the very responsible and delicate duties committed to him, as it is also due to the learned and eminent coun sel who attended the tribunal on the part of this government to express myself of the taients and wisdom which they brought to bear in argument and of the result so happily reached. it will be the province of Congress to provide (or the distribution among those who may be entitled to it of their respec tive shares of the mony to be paid. Al though the sum awarded is not payable until a year from the date of tho award it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making a proper examination of the several cases in which indemnification may be due. 1 consequently recommend the creation of a board ot commissioners for the purpose. Established Oct. 18, 1851 stationed there and for the aassarinn nf all exercise or claim of jurisdiction, so as to .... . L. . rr r. 1 . THE SANJUAM DECISION. By the thirty-fourth article of the treaty of Washington, the respective claims of the United States and Great Britain in their construction of the treaty of the 15th of Jane, l4t, defining the boundary line between their respective lomtoneo were submitted to the arbitra tion and award of his Majesty the titnpe ror of Germany, to decide whiih of these claims is most in accordance with the true interpretation cl tbe treaty of IS 40. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to undertake tbe ar bitration has the earnest thanks of the people of the United States tor the labor, pains and care which he has devoted to the consideration of this long pending difference. 1 have caused an expression of my thanks to be communicated to his .Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the Representa tive of this government at Berlin, con ducted the case and made the statement on the part ot the United Sutes with tbe ability that his past services justified the public in expecting at his hands. As a member ot the cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given use to the discus sion between the two governments, as the Minister to Great Britan when the construction now pronounced unfoun ded was first advanced, and as tho agent and representative of tho government to present the case and to receive the award, he has been associated with the question in all its phases and in every stage has manifested a patnotio leal and earnestness in maintenance of the claim of Uni ted States, lie is entitled to much credit for the success which has attended the submission. After a patient investi gation of the case and of tbe statements ot each party his Majosty, the Emperor of Germany, on the 21st day of -October last signed his award decreeing that the 1 claim of the government of the United States, that the boundary hne between the territories of her Brtunnio Majesty and the United States should be drawn through the ilaro Channel is most in ac cordance with the true interpretation of the treaty concluded on the J 5th of Juno 1848, between agents of her Britannia Majesty aad the United Sutes. Copies of the case presented on behalf of both governments and of the statement in the reply of each and a translation of the award, are transmitted herewith. This ' award oouhrms the United Slates in their claim to the important Archipelago ot islands lying between the continent and Vancouver's island, which for 26 years, snce the ratification ot the treaty, Great Biitain has contested, and leaves ns for . tbe first time in the history of tbe United Sutes as a nation without a question of disputed boundary between our territory and tbe possessions of Great Britain on this continent. It is my gmeful.duty to ac knowledge the prompt, pen taneo us action . of her Msjdty's Government in giving : effect to th award. in anticipation of any request from this government and before the ?eoeption in to United Sutes ot the award signed by the Emperor, her Majesty had given instructions for the removal of her troops which had boon conclusive possession of the lately dispu te", territory, i am grateful to be able to announce that the order for the re moval of the troops has been executed and the militarv ioint nnnnnsrion of Kn Juan has ceased. The islands are now m the exolusive possession of the United States. It now becomes necessary to complete the survey and determination of that portion of the boundary line through tne iiaro cnannei upon which the com mission which determined the remaining pan disagree, a recommend the aDDoiat- munt of a commission to act jointly with one which may be named by Her Majesty tor that purpose. 

ALASKA. Experience of the difficulties attending the determination of onr admitted line of boundary alter the occupation ot the ter ritory and its settlement by those owing allegiance to the respective governments, points to tne importance ot ostablishine by natural objects or other monuments the actual line between tha territnrv an. quired by purchase from Russia and the adjoining possessions ot Her Britaonio Majesty. 1 he occupied that no conflicting interests of individuals or of jurisdiction are likely to interfere to the del av or Amhiirniwmflnt of the actual location ot the line. If de terred until poDulation shall enter and occupy the territory some trivial contest of neighbors may again array the two governments in antagonism. 1 therefore recommend the appointment of a com mission to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part of Great Brit ain to determine the line between onr territory of Alaska and the co-terminus possessions ot Great Britain. VISHERIE3. In my laBt annual message 1 recom mended the legislation necessary on the part ot the United States to bring into operation the articles ot the treaty of VV ashiugton of May lbTl, relating to fisheries and to other matters tonohing the relations of the United States toward the British North American possessions, to become operative so Boon as the proper legislation should be had on tbe part of Great Britain and the possessions. That legislation on the part of Great Britain and its possessions had not then been had and during the session of Congress a question was raised which for the time raised a doubt whether soy action by Congress in tbe direction indicated would become impotant a question which has since been disposed of and I have received notice that the Imperial Parliament and the legislatures of the provincial govern ments have passed laws to carry the pro visions of the treaty on the matters re lerred to into operation. 1 therefore recommend our early adoption of tbe legislation in the same direction necessary on the part of this government. NORTHERN BOUNDARY. The joint commission for determining the boundary line between the United States and the British Provinces between the Lake of the Woods and the Rocky Mountains has organized aud entered upon its work. It is desirable that the force be inoeased in order that the com pletion of the survey and determination of the boundary line may be sooner at tended to. lo this end 1 racouiuiend that a sufficient appropriation be made. FOB 81 ON RELATIONS IN GENERAL. With France, our earliest ally, Russia, the constant and steady friend of the United States, Germany, with whose government and people we have so many causes of friendship and common sympa thies. and the other powers of Europe our relations arc maintained on the most friendly terms since my last annual mes sage. Tbe exchange has been made of the ratification of a treaty with the Aus-tro-HuHgary empire relating to naturali zation ; also of a treaty with the German empire respecting consuls and trade marks; also of a treaty with Sweden and Norway relating to naturalisation, all of which treaties have been duly proclaimed. STATISTICAL CONGRESS. Congress, at its last session, having made an appropriation to defray tie ex pense ot commissioners on the part of the United Sutes to the International ! Statistical Congress at Si. Petersburg, j the persons appointed in that character proceeded to their destination and at- tended the sessions of the Congress. ! Their report will in due season be laid before you. Ihis Congress meets at intervals of about three years and has held its sessions in several ot tbe countries of Europe. I submit to your considera tion the propriety of extending an invita tion to the CoBgress to hold its next meeting in the United States. The centennial celebration to be held in 1876 would afford an appropriate occasion for the meeting. VIENNA EXPOSITION. Preparations are making for the Inter national Exposition to be held during the next year in Vienna on a scale of very great magnitude. The tendency of these expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization and the elevation of industry, oi labor and the increase of human hap piness as well as of greater intercourse and good will between nations. -As this exposition v to be the first which will have been held in Eastern Europe it is believed that American inventors and manufacturers will be ready to avail themselves of the opportunity for the presentation of their productions if en couraged by proper aid and protection. At the last session ofUougress authority was given for the appointment of one or more agents to represent this government at the exposition. The authority thus given Las been exercised but in the ab sence of any appropriation there is tear that the important benefits which tbe exposition offers will in a large degree be lost to the citizens of the United Sutes. I commend the subject strongly to your consideration and recommend that an adequate appropriation be made for the purpose. To further aid American ex hibitors at the Vienna exposition I would recommend, in addition, an appropriation ot money, that the Secretary of the Navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport between our Atlantic cities and Trieste or the most convenient port to Vienna and back, their articles for exhibition. MEXICO. Sinco your last session the President of the Mexican Republic, distinguished by his hteh character and by bis services to his country, his died. His temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity by the people a proof of con fidence on (heir part in his patriotism and wisdom which it is believed will be con firmed by the resullsof li s administration. It is particularly desirable that nothing should be left undone by the government of either Republic to strengthen their re lations as neighbors aud mends, it is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to distract the quiet of the settk-uientson the border between onr land and that ot Mexico and that complaints of wrong to American citizens in various parts of the country are made. The rev olutionary condition in which the neigh boring Republic has so long been involved has in some degree contribted to this dis turbance. It is to be hoped that with a more settled rule of order through the Republic which may be expected from tbe present government the acta of which just complaint is made will oeaao. The proceedings of the commission under tha . convention with Mexico ot the 4th of Ju ly 1868 on the subject ot claims have un fortunately been checked by an obstacle for the removal cj which measures have been taken by tbe two governments, which it is be-' lieved will prove successful. The com missioners appointed pursuant to the joint resolution ot Congress of the 7th of VI ay last, to inquire into depredations on the Texas frontier have diligently made investigations in that quarter. Their report upon the subject will be communi cated to you. Their researches were necessarily incomplete, partly on aosount of the limited appropriation made by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that government, has appointed a similar commission to investigate these outrages. It is not announced officially but the press of that country states that the fullest investigation is desired, and that the co-operation of all parties concerned is invited t J secure that end. I there fore recommend that a special appropria tion be made at the earliest day practica ble to enable the commission on the part of the United States to return to their labors without delay. 

CUBA. It is with regret that I have again to announce a continuance ot the disturbed condition of the Island of Cuba. No ad vance toward the pacification of the dis contented portion of the population has been made while the insurrection has gained no advantages and exhibits no moie ot the elements of power or of the prospect of ultimate success that were exhibited a year ago. Spain on the other haud has not succeeded in its repression and the panics stand apparently in the same relative attitude which they occu pied for a long time past. This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were it seen at a distance from our neighborhood we might be indifferent to its result, although humanity could not be unmoved by many ot its incidents ; whenever they might occur. It is how ever at our door. I cannot doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is among the strongest inducements to the continuance of this strife. A ter rible wrong is the natural cause of a ter rible evil. The abolition of Slavery and the introduction ot other reforms in the administration of government in Cuba could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It is especially to be hoped that the present liberal government of Spain will voluntarily adopt this view. The law of eoianotpation which was passed more than two years since has remained unex ecuted in the absence ot regulation for its inforcemenL It was but a feeble step toward emancipation, but it was the rec ognition of right and was hailed as such and exhibited Spain in harmony with the sentiments of humanity and justice, and in sympathy with the other powers of the Christian and civilized world. Within the past tew weeks the regulations for car rying out the law of emancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity ot intention the present gov ernment to carry into effect the law of 1870. I have not failed to urge the con sideration of the wisdom, the policy and the jasticeof a more effective system for the abolition ot the great evil which op pressed a race and continues a bloody and destructive contest close to our border, as well as the expediency and the justice of re forms of which the propriety is not ques tioned. Deeply impressed with the con viction that the continuance of slavery is one of the most active causes of the con tinuance of the unhappy condition of affairs in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or those claiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed as proper ty, but which is forbidden and denounced by the laws of the United Sutes. They are there, in defiance of the spirit of our own laws, contributing to the continu ance of this distressing aod sickening contest. In my last annual message 1 referred to this subject and I again rec ommend such legislation as may be pro per to denounce and if not prevent at least to discourage American citizens from holding or dealing in slaves. 

SPAIN AND SOUTH AMERICA. It is gratifying to announce that the ratification ot the convention concluded under the auspices of this government between Spain on the one part and the allied republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for an armistice have been exchanged. A copy of the instru ment is herewith submitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent peace between tbe same parties. brazil and Venezuela. The -differences which at one time threatened the maintainance of peace be tween Brazil and the Argentine Repub lic it is hoped are in the way of satisfac tory adjustment. With these, sutes as with the Republics of Central and South America, wc continue to maintain the : most friendly relations. It is with re ! gret, however, I announce that tbe Gov i ernor of Venezuela has made no further ; payments on account of the awards under j he convention of the 5th of April, 1806. I That Republic is understood to be now almost it not quite tranquilizer. It is hoped therefore that it will lose no time in providing tor the unpaid balance ot its debt to the United States, which, having originated in injuries to iu ciii sens by the Venezuela authorities, and having been acknowledged pursuant to a treaty in the most solemn form known among nations, would seem to deserve a preference over debts of a different origin and contracted in a different manner. This subject is again recommended to the attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed proper. japan. "Our treaty relations with Japan re main unchanged. An imposing embassy from that interesting and progressive na tion visited this country during tbe year that is passing, but being unprovidad with powers tor the signing of a conven tion in this country no conclusion in that direction was reached. It is hoped how ever that the interchange of opinion which took place during their stay in this coun try has led to a mutual appreciation ot the interests which may be promoted when the revision of tbe existing treaty shall be undertaken In this connection I icnew my recommendation of one year ago that to give importance and to add to the efficiency ot our diplomatic rela tions with Japan and China and to fur ther aid in maintaining tbe good opinion of these people and to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between these nations and the balance of the commercial world, an appropriation be made to support at least four American youths in each of these countries to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers there. Our representatives would not eve:: then be placed upon an equality with tbe rep resentatives of Great Britain or soma other powers. As now situated our rep resentatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and translations upon natives ot those countries wbo know our language imperfectly, or pro cure for the occasion tbe services of em ployes in foreign business houses or interpreters to other foreign ministers." TERRITORIAL. I renew the recommendation made on a previous occasion of the transfer to the Department of the Interior to which they seem to appropriately belong, ot all the powers and duties in relation to the terri tories with which the Department of State is now charged by law or by cus tom. RELIEF TO AMERICANS ABROAD. Congress from the beginning of the government has wisely made provisions for tbe relief of distressed seamen in for eign countries; no similar provision, how ever, has hitherto been made for the re lief of oitisens in distress abroad other than seamen. It is understood to be cus tomary with other governments to au thorize consuls to extend such relict to their citizens or subjects iu certain eases. A similar authority and aa appropriat ion to oarry it into effoct are commended in ease of oitisens of the United States destitute or sick under such cir cumstances. It is well known that such citizens resort to foreign countries in great numbers, and though most of them are able to bear tho expense incident to locomotion, there are some who through accident or otherwise became penniless and have no friends at home able to se cure them. Persons in this situatian must either perish, cast themselves upon the charity of of foreigners, or be releived as the private charge of onr own officers who usually, even with the most benevo lent dispositions, have nothing to spare for such purposes. Should the authority and appropriation asked for be given, care will be taken to carry the benifieerica of congress into effect so that it shall not be unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed.

From the foregoing statement it ap pears that the net reduction of the prin cipal ot the debt during tbe fiscal year ending June 30th, 1872, was $99,960, 253.54. The source of the reduction is as follows: Net ordinary receipts dur ing the year, $364,6y4,229,91 ; net ordin ary expenditures, including interest on the public debt, $270,559,695.91 , total, $94,134,534.00.

The able and extensive re port made by the commission appointed to investigate the Sutro tunnel has been transmitted to Congress. The observa lions and report of the signal office have been continued. Stations have been maintained at each of the principal lake, seaport and river cities. Ten additional stations have been established iu tho United Sutes and arrangements have been made for the exchange of reports with Canada, and a similar exchange of observations is contemplated with the West India Islands. A RMY EEQOIREMENTS. ' The favorable attention of Congress is invited to the fol owing recommendations of the Secretary of W an A discoutinu ance of the appointment of extra Lieuten ants to serve as Adjutants aud Quarter master; the adoption of a code providing a specific penalty for well defined offenses so that the inequality of sentences ad iu Ig ed by court martial may be adjusted; the consolidation of accounts under which ex penditures are made as a measure of economy; a re-appropriatioi of the mon ey for the construction of a depot at San Antonio, the title to the site being now perfected; a special act placing the cemetery at the city of Mexico on the same basis as other national cemsteries; authority to purchase sites for military posts in Texas; the appointment of com missary serrgeants from non-commissioned officers as a measure for securing the better care and protection of supplies ; an appropriation of the catalogue and tables of the anatomical section of the army medical maseuon; are-appropriation of the amoaul for the manufacture of breech loading arms should the selection be so delayed by the b oard of officers as to leave the former appropriation unex pended at the close of the fiscal year; the sale ol man arsenals east of the Missis sippi as can be spared and the proceeds applied to the establishment of one large arsenal of construction and repair up in the Atlantic coast, and tbe purchase of a suitable sit: for approving and experi mental ground for heavy ordnance ; the abrogation of laws which deprive inven tors in the United Slates service from i deriving any benefit from their invention; the repeal ot the law prohibiting promo tions in the staff corps ; a continuance of the work upon the coast defences ; the repeal of the 7th section of the act of July 13th, 1866 taking from engineer soldiers the per diem granted to other troops ; a limitation of time for the pres entation of suhsistance supplies claims I under the act ot July 4ih, 1804 and a modification in the mode of the selection of cadets fjr the military aead amy m or der to enhance the usefulness of the acad emy which is impaired by rea on of ill ! large amount of time uecessaiiiy expeul ed in giving new cadets a th irough knowledge of the mere elementary branches of learning which they should acquire before entering the academy ; ance at the close of the year accompanied j also an appropriation tor philosophical with sale at tbe commencement of the year, $337,348.65. Total, $99,960,252. 54 This sutemeut treats solely of the principal of the public debt by the month ly statement of the public debt whieh adds together the principal and interest due and unpaid and interest accrued to date due, and deducts the cosh in tho treasury, as according on the day of publi cation the reduction was $10,054 449, 128. I be source of this reduction is as f ollows: Reduction in principal account $-.19,960,-003.54 ; reduction in unpaid interest account $3,330,952.96 ; toul $103,290, 956 50 Reduction in cah on haud $2,746,465.22 ; total $100,544,491.28. On the basis of the last table the state ments show a reduction of the public debt from the 1st of March, 1869, to the present time as follows : From March 1st, 1869, to Ma-ch 1st, 1870, $37,134, 782.S4 ; from March 1st, 1870, to March 1st, 1871, $117,619 630.25 ; from March 1st. 1S71. to March 1st, 172, $94,895, 348 94; from March 1st, 1872, to No vember lt, 1872, eight months, $64, 047,237.84; total. $363.696,999 87. With the great reduction of taxation by the acts ol Congress at the last ses sion the expenditure of the government in collecting the rvveuue will tie much reduced for the next fiscal year. It is very doubtful, however, whether any fur; her reduction of so vexatious a bur then npon any people will be practicable for the present. At all events as a measure ei justice to the holders of the national certificates of indebtedness I would recommend that no more legisla tion be had npon this subject unless it be to correct errors of omission or commis sion in tbe present laws until sufficient time has elapsed to prove that it can be doue and suit have i-uthcient revenue to meet the current expenses of tho govern ment, paying interest on the public debt and provide tor the sinking funds e-tau-lisbed by law. The preservation of our national credit is of the highest import ance. icxt in importance to mis comes a solemn duty to provide a national cur rency of fixed and unvarying value as compared with gold, as soon as practica- Mc having due regard for tbe interests I of the debtor class and the vicissitudes of trade, and convertible into gold at par. apparatus and an increase in the nu ubers and tbe pty ot the military academy. 

INTER-TRANSPORTATION. WAR DEPARTMENT. " The report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War De partment for the fiscal year ending June 30lh, 1871, to be $33,799,991.82, and for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1872, to be $35,372,157.20, showing a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year of $427,834.62. The estimates for military appropriations for ths next fiscal year ending June 30th, 1872. are $33.8i1.37i 78. The estimates ot the chief of engi neers are submitted separately for fortifi cation and harbor improvements and for public buildings and grounds and the Washington aqueduct. The affairs of tho Freedman's Bureau have all been transferred to the War Department and reguiatious have been put into execution for the speedy pay ment ol bounty, pay, Ac, due colored soldiers properly coming uuder that bureau. ' All war asc unt s for money and pro perty prior to 1871 have been examined and transmitted lo the treasury tor final settlement. During tbe fiscal year there has been paid fr transportation on , railroads $130,000, of which $80,837 was over the Pacific railroads ; lor transportat ion by water $626,372 52, and by stage $48,975, 84, and for the purchase of transpona tioe animals, wagons, hire of teamsters, Ac, $924,650 74 Abaut $270 0X) bave been ooilevted f rom southern railroads during the year, leaving about $4,000, 000 still due. The Quartermaster hat fiiniined and transmitted to the accounting otlioers tor settlement $36,617 of claims by loyal citizens for quartermaster's store taken during the war. Suheistsinoe supplies to tbe amount of $8. 904,812 have been is sued to lodum. -t - , . Theannaal average mean strength? of ihe army was 24,210 white, and 2,44 colored soldiers. The to'al deaths for the year reported were 36T white and 54 colored. ; . The distribotioo of the medical and surgical history ot the war is yet to be ordered by Congress. There exists an ab solute oectivSaity tor a medical corps ot the full number establish td by an ' act of Congress of July 28th, I860, there being now 59 vacancies and the uumber of suc cessful eaudidates rarely exceed eight or ten in aor one year. - The river and har bor improvements have been carried on with energy and economy. Though many are only partially completed the result have saved to eutnmerea many times the amount expended. The increase of com merce with greater depth of channels, greater- security ia . navigation, aad tae saving of time adds mum to tbe wealth of the government. Tbe bridge across the Mississippi river at Rook Island has The attention of Congress will be Cilled during its present session to various en terprises for the more certain and cheaper trauporttion of the con.-tanily increas ing surplus of the western an 1 southern products to the Atlantic seaboard. The su' jcct is one that will force itstlf npon the legislative branch ot the government I sooner or later, and 1 sugne.-t therefore ' that immediate steps be taken to gain all I available uiiorma ion, and insure equit ; able and j it legislation.

Second and third nrw routes will be proposed tor the consideration ot Con?res. namely: by an extension of the tv inawrii and James river caaal 'o the Ohio anl by the extension of the CheiApeake and Ohio : canal. 1 am not preiwred to recommend ; government aid to these or other enter prises untd it is clearly shown that they 1 are not only of national interest bu-. that when completed they will be of a value commensurate with their cost. Tt.at production increases more rapidly than the means of transportation in our coun try has been demonstrated by past ex perience ; that the unprecedented growth in pnpalat'on and the projects of the who e country will require additional fa cilities and cheaper means fir the nvr; bulky articles ot commerce to reach tide water and a market will be demand ed in ihc near future is equally demonstrable. 1 would therefore u gest either a committee or commission to be anthoritd to consider this whole question and to report to Congress at some future day for its better guidance m legislating on the important subject. The railroads of the country have toeen rapidly extended during the la-t few years to meet the growing demand of producers and reflect much credit upon the capitalists and managers engjsed in their construction. In addition to these a project to faciliate commerce hy the building of a 'bin cmal arousd Niagara Falis on the United Slates side which has been agitated fjr many years will no doubt be called to your attention this session. Looking lo the great future of the country and the increasing demands of commerce it might be will while on this subj ict not only to have examined and report upon the various practicable routes for connecting the Mississippi with tide water oa the Atlantic but the feasi bility of an almost oon'muius land locked navigation from M ime to the Gult ot Mexico. Such a route along our joast would be of great value at all times and ot inestimable value in case of a for- I eign war. i autre na provided tne greater part of this route and the obsta cles to be overcome are eaily within the skill el th engineer. I have nrit alluled to this subject with the view of having any further expenditure of 'public money at this time than may be nscessiry to procure anl place all the neces-ary information before Congress in an authen tic form to enable it hereafter if deemed practicable a id worthy to legislate on the subject without delay. 

NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of the navy herewith aceo npatiymj exponas fully the coudition of this branch of the public service, its wants and deficiencies. expense lucurred daring the pait year and appropriation lor the same. It also gives a complete hi-tory of thu sur vives of the navy for tbe psst year in addition t its regular services. It is evident that unless srp ire taken to preserve our uavy that iu very few years the United States will be the weakest nation upon the ocean of all the great, powers. With an energetic, progressive lusioess people like ours penetrating an i forming business rciatioos with every part of the known world, a navy strong euough to command the respect of our arms abroad is neoessary for the full pro tection of their rights. I recomsenl careful consideration by Congress of tha recommeudatious made by the Sccreury ot the 'avy. ; ..'"" " :' POST OPKICE DEPARTMENT. The accompanying report of the Post master General furnishes a full and satis factory exhibit of '.he operations - of the Post Oifise Department during th? year. The ordinary reveuues of the Depart ment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, amounted to $21,915,426.37, anl the expenditures $26,658,192.20. ; Com pared with the previous fiscal year tho increase of revenue was $1,878,380.95, or 9.37 per eoot, and the iiKirease of expen ditures $2,268,088.23, or 9 29 percent. Adding to the ordinary revenues ' h annual appropriation of $700,000 for frto matter aod the amounts paid to the sub sidies on mail steamship lines from special appropriations the deficiency paid out of tbe general treasury was $3,317, 765 94, an excess of $389 707.28 over the deficiency for ths year 1871. Other in teresting statistical information relating to our rapidly extending postal service is torm-'nea in tnis report, ine total length of railroad mail routes on ths thirtieth ot Jane, 1872, was 57,911 miles; 8,077 additional milei of service have been put into oporation during the year ; 8 new lines of railway post othjes have been esUbtishea with an aggregrate length of 2.909 miles; the number of letters exchanged in the mails with foreign countries was 24,362,500, an increase ot 4,066,502, or twenty per cent, over the number in 1871, and the postage thereon amounts to $1,871,257.25. lhe total weight of the mails exchanged with European countries exceeds 820 tons; the cost of transatlantic mail steamship service was $220,301 70; the total cost of the United States ocean steamship service including the annuo ts pi id to the subsi dised lines of mail steamers, was $1,027, 020.97. The followiug are the only steamship lines now receiving subsidies for mail service unler special act ot Congress : The Pacific Mail Co. recitve $500,000 per annum tor czrrying a monthly mail between San Francisco, Japan and China which will be increased to $1,000,000 per annum and a semi mouthly mail on and after the first of Oct 1873; the United Sutes and Brazil Mail Steamship Co., receive $ 1 50,000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail be tween New Y ork and Rio da Janeiro, and Brazil ; and tbe California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Co., receive $750,000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between San Ftancisco and Honolulu anl Hawaiian I-lan Is, making the total amount of mail steamship subsi dies at prestut $7,250,000 per annum. Our postal communications with all parts of the civilized world have been placed upon a most advantageous fooling by the improved postal connections and arrange ments reoeutly concluded with the leading commercial countries of Europe and America, and the gratifying statement is made that with the conclusion of a satisfactory convetion with France,the de tails of which have been detiuitly agreed to by the hea l of the Frt iuh postal de partment, subject to the approval of tbe minister of finance, little remains to be accomplished by treaty for some time to come in respect to the reduction of rates or improved facilities of postal intercourse. i our favorable consideration is resect fully invited to the recommendation at tho close made by the Post Master Gsn eral for an increase of service from monthly to semi monthly trips on the mail steamship route to Urazil ; for a subsidy to provide for the establishment ot au American line ot mail steamers between fian Francisco, New Zealand and Australia ; for the es tablishment of post office savings banks and for the increase of the salaries of the heads of bureaus. I have heretofore commended the abolition of the franking privilege and see no reason now for changing my views on that subject. It not having been favorably regarded by Congress, however, I now suggest a mod location of that privilege to correct its glariu and costly abuses. POSTAL TELEGRAPHY. I would rejommend also the appoint ment of a comm'ttee or commissim to take into consideration the best method, equi'able to private corporation who have luvested their time and capital in the es tablishment of telegraph liaes,of acquiring the title Mall telegraph tines nw in operation ani ol couoecting their service with the po-tt service of the nation. It is not pro-iab! j that this subject could receive the proper consideration during the limits ot a short session of Congress bat it in ly be initiated so that further action may be fair to tbe government and to private parties concerned. STEAMSHIP SUBSIDIES. There are bat three lines of ocean stesmers, namely : The Pacific Mail Steamshi a Co. , between San Francisco, China and Japan with provision made lor -emi-momh!y service after October lit, 173 ; the United St-ites and Brazil line, monthly, aud the Ca iforuia. New Zealand and Australion line, monthly. plying between the United States and therein named disturb the peace of the country. It is much to be regretted, and is by no one more than myself, that necessity has ever existed to execute the the enforcement act. No one can desire more than 1 that the necessity of apply ing it may never again be demanded. DEPARTMENT OP THE INTERIOR. The Secretary of the Interior reports satisfactory improvement and progression in each of he several bureaus under tha oontrol ot the interior department They are all in excellent condition. The work which in some ot them lor some years has been in arrears has been brought down to a recent date aud in all the cur rent business has been promptly dis patched. INDIANS. The policy which was a lop ted at the be ginning of tbe administration with regard to the management of tbe Indians has been as successful as its most ardent friends anticipated within so shorts time. It has reduced the expense of.their main tenance, decreased their forages upon ths white settlements, tended to give the largest opportunity to the exteusion oil the great railway through the public do minion snd the pushing of settlements into more remote districts of the country and at the same time improve tbe condi tion of the Indians, and the policy will be maintained without any change except ing such as further experience may show to be necessary to render it more efficient The subject of converting the so called Indian territory south ot Kansas into a home fur the Indiau and erecting there on a territorial form of government is one of great importance as a complement of tbe existing Indian policy. The question of removal to tbe territory has within the past year been presented to many of the tribes resident upon other and less desirable portions of the public domains and has generally been received by them with favor. As a preliminary step to tbe organization cf such a territory it wiil be to tontine the Indians now resident there into farms ot proper Bize which should be secured to them in fee, the residue to be used for tbe settlement ot other friendly Indians. Efforts will b made in tbe immediate future to induce the removal of as many peaceably disposed Indians only to the Indian territory as can be set tled properly without disturbing tbe harmony of those already there. There is no other location now available where a people who are endeavoring to acquire a knowledge of pastoral and agricultural pursuits can be as well accommodated as upon the unoccupied lands in the Indian territory. A territorial government should however protect the Indians ttom the inroad of whites for a term of years unt'd they become eutlhiently advanced in the aru and civilization to guard their own rights an 1 from the disposal of lands held by them from the same period. 

PUBLIC LANDS. During tbe last fi-cal year there were disposed of out of the publio lands 11, 864.975 acres, a quantity greater by 1,099,270 acres than was disposed of the previous year. Of this amount 1,370,320 acres were sold for cash ; 389,460 acres located with military warrants ; 4,671, 332 acres taken for homesteads ; 693,613 acres located with college scrip ; 3,554. 837 acres granted to railroads; 465,347 acres granted to wagon roads ; 714.255 acres given to states as swamp land ; 5,760 acre9 located by Indian scrip. The cash receipts froin ail wouroes iu the land office amounted to $3 218.100. During the same period 22.016,608 acres- ot the public lands were surveyed which added to the quantity before surveyed amounts to 5s3.364.780 acres, 'leaving 1,257,633.628 acres of the public lands still unsurveyed. The reports from .be subordinates of the land office con tain Interesting information in regard to their respective districts. They uniform ly mention the fruitfulnessof the soil dur ing the pi t season, and the increased yield of ail kinds ot produce, and evince that those states and territories, where min inii is the principal business, agricultural j products have exceeded the local demand ' and liberal shipments have been made to J distant points. PATENTS. i During the year ending Sept 30, 1872, ': they were issued from the patent office ' 13,616 patents, 233 extensions and 536 certificates and registers of trade marks. foreign ports and owned and operated un- 'j During the same time 19,587 applications der our flag. I earnestly recommend that such liberal contracts for carrying the mails be authorized w;th these lines as will insure their con'inuance. If tha expediency of extending the ai l of the government to hues ot steamers wnicn hitherto have not reesived it should be deemed worthy of the consideration of Congress, political anl commercial objects make it advisable to bestow such aid on a line under our flig between Panna-na and the Western South American ports. By this means much trade imw diverted to other coun tries might be brought to the United States to the mutu i! advantage of this country and those being in that quarter of lhe continent of Amrrioa. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will show an alarm. ng falling off in our carrying trade for the last ten or twelve years and even for the paet year. 1 do not believe that public treasure tan be better expend ed in the interest of the whole people than in trying to recover this trade. An expenditure of $5.0iHJ,00O per annum for the next live years, if it would resiore to us our prop-onion of the carrying trade ot the world would be profitably expended. The prize of labot in Europe has been so much enhance! wi hio tbe iast few years tha' the cost of building and operating ocean steamets in l.ie United States is is no: so much greater than in Europe, that 1 believe the time has come for Con i gress to taki this sui ject into serious consideration DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. Detailed statemetiU of the disburs ments through the Department of Justice will be f iruisned by the report of the t oraey General, and though these have been somewhat in :reiscd by the recent acts f Cougress to tuforcs the rights of citizens ot the United States to vote ia ihc several s'.a'es of th Union and to en force th? provisions of the fourwenth amendment t the constitution of the United States aad the amendment there to.

The commissioner shows that the office has outgrown the original plan and that a new organization has become necessary. This subject was preser.ted to Congress in a special oommunicatiou in February last with my approval and the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and tbe suggestions contained in said communication were embraced in a bill that was reported to the House by the coniuiittee on patents of la-t session. Tbe subject of tbe reorganization oi the patent oifiee as contemplated by the bill referred to is of such importance to the industrial interests of the country that I commen i it to the attention of Congress, fhe commissioner also treats the subject of thc separation of the patent office from tHe departmffnt of the interior This subject is also embraced iu the bill hereto fore referred to. The commissioner com- ; plains of the want of room for the model ! gallery and for the working force and 1 necessary files of the office. It is i aipossilie ' to transact the business u tne o'Jice prop i erlv without mora roooj in which to ar range tiles and drawiogs that must be consulted hourly iu tbe transiiction of !msiaes. Tbe whole of the pateut oriice building will soon be needed if it is not already for the aceommoiation of the business ot the patent oihoe.
