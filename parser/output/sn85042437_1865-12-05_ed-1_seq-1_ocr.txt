A London Jenkins, who saw the Eng lish Princesses Helena and Louise recent ly unveil a statue of Prince Albert, in forms us that "they are much taller and finer figure every way than tbe married Princesses, and resemble the Queen in a certain manner of doing tl.eir work with dignity, yet without hauteur," and com municates the - important fact that they wore no crinoline. , A nurse girl at Preston, who squinted badly, was about to be discharged by her master, who feared his child might get a in his eye, when she happened to go with some frionds to the Preston Exhibi tion.

A stage was got and a rope fixed and put round the Deck of MttAnulty by McAulay, who let drop fall in a masterly style, and left McAnulty hanging by the neck. Some of neighbors, on hearing of the affair, ran the rescue, and succeeded in cutting down in time to save his life. The London Morning Pott says: "Mr. William Hughes, the French translator, applied, to the Paris Board of Index, the official censors are called, for the stamp to authorize the sale of a transla tion into French of Thackeray's 'Memoirs an English Valet' (1 'Jeemes' Diary.')

This indicates that he intends to leav Cabinet toon. . true as how Causes of the Jamaica Outbreak. "Whilst all are familiar with the sicken ing details of the bloody scenes recently transpiring iu;Jamaiua, feW haVe much knowledge of tbe causes which led to the outbreak. The island of Jamaica, smaller geographically than the State of Massa chusetts, contains an aggregate of 441,000 persons. Of this population, the elective franchise is exercised by only 2,500, about one in 1 76. Here is sufficient cause for the gravest apprehension, for no such dis regard of the rights of the masses can be practiced through a succession of years without breeding dissensions in the State1 But this is not all. Under British rule, Church and State are united. The Church 'of England is the established church of : tbe island, although a very small minority are members of that or ganization. The majority are attached to vnrious other denominations, including the Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian and Ivoman Cathie. Here is another potent element of discord a people heavily taxed for tbe support of a religion for which they have no regard. The dominant Church, backed by a government ready to enforce its claims at the point of the bayonet, became arrogant and dicta torial, its clergv indulging in the bitterest invective against dissenting clergymen, whom they are now denouncing as guilty duping the Kegrbes into rebellion. Tbe Governor, the highewt executive authority, holds his office under the Brit ish -crowni He appoints ft privy council, . alto a legislative - council composed of seventeen members. There an elective assembly, comprising forty- seven members, two from each of the twenty-two parishes into which the island divided. The laws are framed by the legislative council and the assembly, but ay be vetoed by the Governor. The planters control tlie government, and have framed the legislation of the country as perpetuate their power, as is shown by very limited franchisegranted. Since emancipation of the blacks, in 1838, freedmen have been vainly seeking to obtain their rights under the law ; whilst ex-slaveholders, true to the instincts slaveholders everywhere, have persist ently denied all tbe privileges it was pos sible to withhold. The negroes have no rights in ' the courts, and it impossible for them even to collect the wages for which they have toiled. The local magistrates are chiefly clergymen tbe established church, and the councils : and the assembly are in hands of the clergy and - the planters. Negro cannot enforce a contract cannot have a single right protected yet is taxed for the support not only of tho Government but tbe Church. In addition these disadvantages, and the additional of largely exceeding the dominant in numbers, the Negroes are brought competition with tho Cooly system of labor, which is slavery in its worst form. Everything is done to oppress and degrade bratalin th Negro, ho being prac- "tically a slave, while enjoying a nominal freedom. Is it strange that such a monstrous sys of tyranny such total disregard of rights of humanity such wanton violation of the laws of God such pros titution of the religion of Christ such mockery of . legislation such exhibitions cruelty, cupidity and faithle&nessjshould produce strife? Does not revolt against villainies and such barbarities even though they be perpetrated in the name under the guise of religion and law to the dignity of a revolution ? and not the three thousand victims of British cruelty patriots worthy of the martyr's crown ? '"We would not encour causeless rebellion ; we hold treason to the highest offense in the black cata of crime ; but tho right of revolu in case of oppression is inherent and inalienable; and if British statesmen remove the causes of revolution! must look to it that persons classed freemen are protected in the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," enjoyment of their religious opinions, the exercise of a suffrage based upon something more rational than tbe color of skin or the amount of property he chance to own. . to of for for son the dus-kee, The catalogue of officers and students of Harvard University for 1855-66 has been published, a copy of which we have re from Mr. Libby, the Librarian. total number of student is 927.

The remarkably fine November weather has enabled the vine growers to secure their large grape crop in good condition Tbe last shipment of some ninety tons was made the present week. AVithout going into particulars as to ownership of vine yards, etc, we present the following infor mation and statistics in regard to the grape interest on the main land in the vicinity of Sandusky. Included within a range of five miles on the shore and one and a half in the in terior, embracing aeven and a half square miles, or forty-eight hundred acres of land, is the legitimately recognized main land grape region. It extends two miles to the east or south-cast, and three miles to the west from the centre of the city of San dusky. There are now planted to grapes within this region about one-fourth of the land, or, nearer to exactness, eleven hun dred and fifty acres, of which there were about three hundred and fifty acres in bearing this season, yielding probably not loss than six hundred tons first yea bearing vineyards yielding about one ton to the acre, older ones from two to five tons. Of this six hundred tons of grape about one hundred tons were shipped the remaining five hundred made into wine and brandy. Estimating twelve pounds of grapes to the gallon of wine, gives about eighty-three thousand gallons of wine made here. The quantity of brandy made from pomace is more difficult to esti mate. There will be not far from nine hundred acres of vineyards in bearing on the main land in the vicinity of Sandusky next season. It is estimatod that there are one thousand acres more of land included in the range stated, equally as well adiiptod to the cultivation of the grape as that al ready planted. These lands are valued at from two hundred to five hundred eollars per acre. V ineyards in bearing are val ued and sell at from one thousand to fif teen hundred dollars per acre, according location and condition. Iho Catawba is the principal grape grown here, though the Isabella is culti vated to some extcnt and has thus far proved quite as profitable as the Catawba. The Delaware, Diana, Concord, Norton's Virginia, Ives' Madeira, and a few other varieties have been planted to some ex tent, though not to" exceed fifty acres of all varieties, other than Catawba and Isa bolla. Farther to the westward from Sandusky than the boundary given, near the Bay shore, there may be from fifty to oac hun dred acres of grapes planted. The adapta bility of the soil is under trial, and by some is still thought questionable. To the eastward of tbe city, on jthe slate forma tion between ripe Creek and the village Huron, many are experimenting in grape culture, and the clay portions of the land may prove satisfactory and profitable vineyards. Land in that locality" sells about one hundred dollars per acre. .There are perhaps from one to two hun dred acres set to grapes on the Lake shore east of Huron, and in the vicinity of Ver million are quite extensive vineyards, some of them in bearing. On Johnson's Island, in Sandusky Bay, a vineyard of about a dozen acres, put out by Mr. John son, proprietor of the Island, and w hich would have borne the first crop this sea; has been destroyed by the Govern ment use of the property for the confine ment of rebel prisoners. There are ever two hundred acres of fine grape land on Island. Sandusky and vicinity have an inter esting local history running way back into Indian and f rencn traditions, bah-un- a Wyandot word, means "still clear water" a name at once descriptive the beautiful Bay so richly tinted and mellowed by Indian rummer haze and sunset. According to Wyandot tradition, century or so before the whites first vis ited Sandusky, a great lamine among tne natives of tho North compelled the Wyan dots to cross the Lako by way of tbe Islands in pursuit of subsistence. This they found plentiful in the luxuriant San dusky valley. They established their chief town at Upper Sandusky, and small er ones in various parts of their territory. When the French began to trade at San dusky in 1708, the Wyandot was the most powerful tribe on the southern shore of Erie. The French enjoyed a monop oly of the trade at Sindusky until 1744, which time they had formed a small settlement there. That year the Wyan dots found that better bargains could be made with the English traders on the Up per Ohio, feuds with the French followed, of the latter were killed and the rest of eottlnnt ucupud to Detroit. " In 1 7 4'J peace was restored between the French Wyandots, and French traders again visited Sandusky. By U 755 tho English traders had become somewhat numerous Sandusky, and in the year of the "French War" waged between France England for dominion in North Amer ica the Wyandots massacred the English please the French traders; and from 1735 to 1765 the French were the only white people at Sandusky. The French War closed by the complete triumph ot British arms in 1761, yet the Indian allies the French kept up hostilities against western English colonists until Pont s defeat in 165. Soon after the Revolutionary War some twenty families from the French settle ments on the Detroit Biver and Lake St. Clair immigrated to the Peninsula, under protection of the Indian chief Ogontz. 1809, Mr. W'olcott and Mr. Bull, of Danbury, Connecticut, also settled with their families on toe feninsula. in tne War of 1812 hey, witb the other settlers, to flee from their homes. The French went to Canada. The Wolcott's and Bull's found safety at Newburgh, Cuyahoga county. There Mr. Bull died, and Mrs. and her children went back to Connec ticut. When Gen. Harrison had driven British and their savage allies into Can ada, Mr. Wolcott returned to his Penin home. In 1805 the agents of the Fire Lands Company made a treaty with tho tribes of Ottawas living on and near present site of the city of Sandusky, Ogontz did not lead his people back to where the greater portion of the Ottawa nation dwelt, until 1811. The lo cality of his cabin is still pointed out, near centre ot tne pleasant nay uity. Sandusky developed great energy end enterprise in the early struggle with Cleveland for the first position in Ohio on Lake, and took tbe lead in becoming connected with the Ohio Biver by rail way. The city has continued to grow steadily in population, business and im portance, And was never more prosperous than now. Ileal estate is advancing and demand, manufactories are busy and increasing, and new homossome of them, a Cor-rse. m:r all for sett f Can to also. most est n to at like Mr. McKelvey's, quit palatial are springing up in all the wards. Merchants and manufacturers speak of their business as never so good before, and extensive preparations for building next season are being made. Among other improvements on loot, Messrs. Gregg & Stead have bought the Buy City Mills and Townsend pr.perty, to be converted into an ex tensive carriage, wagon and spoke manufactory, the establishment to cive employment to one hundred men. The workers in wood find Sandusky a very eligible locality for operations, the timber of the Peninsula, Islands, the Bay shores and Sandusky River, being of antf nualitv and readily oDtainea. : it may surprise some to hear that Mr. James oolworth in tho manuiaeiure oi ax handles and wood saws employs seventy- live men in tho shop and twenty-live outside, a.nd turns out $120,000 worth of tue manuiactured articles a year, ne keens his steamer and a scow emnloved in bringing timber from the Islands, Penin sula, etc Messrs. JBaimy, OccoDoc ana Torrev employ from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five men in their manufactory of hubs, spokes, bent work, kc pri ll ibly usine a capital ot jizu.uuu. They have sail boats for gathering the raw material. Messrs. fierce, woolsey & Co, in the manufacture of spokes alone employ from nlty tr st-venty -trvenren ana have a stcamor for timber freighting. Messrs. L. Luce ot Co, and Messrs Robin son & Son, are extensively engaged in the manufacture of staves and barrets; and the making of boxes for packing grapes is also quite an item in Sandusky industry. The foregoing are but specimens ot wood working, mat, witn numerous other manufactories, are Civ in 5 healtbv bone and sinew to this prosperous coinmunitv. Clevelanders should know and appre ciate their western liake neighbors better. The advantages would bo mutual. To this end reirular and direct steam com mu mention is very desirable. A boat to Sandusky and tbe Islands would pay well as a business investment, and better still in relief from summer heats and citv dust, aud by affording frequent and cheap relaxations of the money-making strain by delightful trips with wife and children to the healthful waters ana grateful shades of Grape Land.

While ths roll was being called Mr. May nard, of Tennessee, whose name had not been placed on the roll by Mr. Mcl'herson, wanted to suggest something, but the Clerk refused to be interrupted. After the call waa completed, Mr. Mavnard acraia arose to speak, but the Clerk again ruled him out of order. One hundred and seventy-five members answered to tneir namss. Mr. James Brooks, of Xew York, made a speech characterising the omission of the names of the member, from Tennessee from the roll as unprecedented, unjust aud totally uncalled for. If, he said. Mr. MaynArd was not a loyal man from a Union and loyal State, then the President of the United States was not a loral man but an alien and a stranger. He charged that the adoption of the resolution excluding the Southern members from this House by the Republican caucus was designed as antag onistic to tne r residents lortneoming mes sage. The House took no action on the subject but under the operation of the pre vious question proceeded to the election of bpeaker.. lion, benuvier Lolhix of Indiana, and Hon. James Brooks, of Sew York, were put nomination. The House then proceeeded to vote with llie lol lowing result: rot Mr. Joi'ax i,fy ; Mr. Brooks .J5.

"Inferring that from Bhore to shore in our land there is peace, its duties are as obvious as the sun's pathway in the heavens. Representing in two branches the States and people, its first and highest obligation is to guarantee every btate a republican form of gov ernment.

It is for you, Repre sentatives, to do your work as faithfully and well as did tne tearless saviors ot the Union on their more dangerous arenas of duty. Then we may hope to see the va cant and once abandoned scats around gradually tilling up until this shall contain representatives from every State and district, their hearts devo to the Union for which theyare to legis late, jealous ol its honor, and ot its glory, watchful of its rights and hostile to enemies, and the stars on our banner, that pa'ed when the States they represented arrayed themselves in arms against the na tion, will shine with a more brilliant light of loyalty than ever be lore- I Appiause.j inviting me guidance oi Jtiun wuo noms destinies of nations in the hollow of His hand, I enter again Upon the duties of this trying position with a heart filled with gratitude for the unusually flattering man ner in which it has been bestowed, and cheered by the hope that it betokens your cordial support and assistance in all its grave responsibilities. 1 am now ready to take the oath of office prescribed by law.

Nsw York, December 4. The World's Washington special says: The conservative Senators pronounce the President's message sound to the core. He argues at considera ble lenirth in favor of his policy of recon struction. He says our relations with Eng land and France were never more satisfac tory. He calls special attention to the re commendation of Secretary MeCulloeh to convert the seven-thirty bonds, at any time before their maturity, at the option of tbe Secretary, into six per cent, interest bonds, in gold. Mutilated Currency. The Herald's Washington special says that durinir the last week $275,400 in mu tilated currency were passed into the Treas ury, and $ail,08 in certificates of indebt edness were redeemed. Smuggling. The collectors on the frontier say that the smugglers who have been so active, are be coming alarmed at the preparations made to apprehend them, and the business is fall ing oil. me merchant along tne line, own. in the States and Canada, are shutting np their shops and suspending operations aince the revenue officers have inaugurated the system of closely examining the clothing of females who cross. That class of travellers is falling off. Not one woman crosses the St Lawrence where twenty did before. Claims. During the month of November the Comptroller of the Treasury revised 2,773 Srise claims, and 6,406 claims of friends of eceased soldiers. The Second Comptroller has decided th&t, in the case of soldiers de tailed in the War DeDartment the payment of bounties maturing while on such service cannot be made, as extra pay is received lor duty of thiB kind. It is also decided, nnder the same author ity, that soldier a who enlists in the Veteran Reserve Corps, under the provisions of gen eral order No. 191. of June 25, 1864,is noten titled to any installment of bounty maturing when serving as a clerk in any department, but if discharged with all the men of this corps because the government no longer re quired the service of their entire term of enlistment, he maintains the same footing and rights in regard to bounty claims as pertains to tbe balance of the members of the same Congress. The Tribune's Washington special says the Senate will convene at 12 o'clock and await the organization of the House and adjourn. A senatorial caucus will be held to pre pare a list of committees. With what temper the resolve of the House caucus raising a joint standing committee upon the admission of Southern members will be received is not yet entirely under stood. Some of the Senators, approving the spirit and intent of the resolution, are jeal ous of any infringement of the rights of the two bodies under the constitution to regulate the admission of their respective organiza tions. There is no doubt of concurrent ac tion, but the passage of a resolution by the House sffixing the conditions of member ship in the Senate and rice versa is so suggest ive of irregularity, if not inconsistency, that it is thought possible, by influential persons both branches of the National Legisla ture, that similar, though separate commit tees, will be raised in lieu of the joint com mittee. The House will meet and go through with the form of organization without delay. The several caucus nominees, and espe cially the door-keeper, have had little time tor their devotions to day, so unnecessarily importunate have been the place seek ers. These candidates are Irom the heroes of many battles, down to the widow's son who want to be a page, and their name is legion. After organizing, the Hnuse will adjourn till Tuesday when the Message and accom panying report will be read. General Howard. Gen.
