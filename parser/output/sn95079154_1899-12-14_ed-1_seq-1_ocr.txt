TI A VOL. VIII. BOER STRENGTH WAS 6RAYELY UNDERESTIMATED. London War Office's Explanation of The Reverse of General Gatacre at Stormberg. CHECK CONSIDERED MOMENTARY. However, It is Admitted That the Effect Upon The Wavering Dutch Farmers Will Undoubtedly Render the Task of The British More Difficult. ?Ladysniith News Is Cheering. ndon, Dec. 11.?While the reverse sustained by Loid Gatacre in bis first en? gagement with the Boers is considered here to be only a momentary check, still the effect upon the morale of the Boers and the minds of the wavering Dutch farmers in Cape Colony will undoubtedly render the tusk of the British much more difficult. General Gatacre, moving out Saturday with 4,000 men, including two batteries of artillery from Putter's Kraal, in hope of surprising the Boers at Storm berc, was misled by his guides, and found himself in an untenable position, with the result that he was obliged to retire with seveie losses upon Molteno. He reports that more than 600 officers and men are missing, in addi? tion to a list of killed and wounded. This newB has been received with the greatest apprehension here, and is espe? cially deplored because of the effect it is likely to have on the Dutch in the north of the Cape Colony. KeTiforcements will be sent up with all speed to make General Gatacre's position Becdrfi*feut the fact that he ha3 gravely underestimated the strength of the Boers opposed to him is responsible for a feeling of considerable uneasiness as to the im? mediate future of the campaign in that section. The news from Ladysmith, however, has created great enthusiasm in London. General White evidently has not forgotten the art of delivering a smashing blow, nor have his troops lose their wonted dash through the harrassments of a prolonged seige. The destruction of two big guns and capture of a Maxim on Friday was the severest blow the Boers have received in the operations of Ladysmith. News of a beginning of a general advance from Frere is momentarily expected. The trestle bridge over the river has been finished. The only anxiety of the troops is to hear the word of command to go for? ward. There is likely to be hard, stub? born fighting. A Ladysmith resident who has escaped to Estcourt reports that he believes large forces of Boers to be on the Upper Tugela and at Coleneo. All indications point to the fact that there baa been a weakening -eXihe^Boer forces around Ladysmith. Prom the western border there is no news that General Methuen has foupht a fourth engagement there. London had repot ts from Pretoria last night that fight? ing began Saturday nearSpyfontein, where the Boers are intrenched on a range of small hills which line each side of the railway. It is probable that the fight was part of the British reconnoi?ance, when a naval 4-7 gun was taken out beyond the outposts and fired a few rounds of lyddite shells. 

MOVEMENTS IN LUZON. Navy Disappointed to Find Olango Al? ready Occupied. Manila, December 11.?6:45 p. m.?The advance guard of General Grant's com? mand, under Major Spence, arrived at Olangapo, during the night of Saturday, December the 9th, which place was occu? pied with litt!3 resistance, the enemy flee? ing. Major Spence had an arduous march oyer the mountain trails from Dinalupi hian. Yesterday morn'ng the Baltimore and Oregon and a chartered transport arrived at Olangapo from Manila. The navy was disappointed to find the army in posses? sion of the piace, which they had hoped to capture. A detachment of marines under Captain Myere occupied the navy yard at Olangapo and will hold and oc? cupy it as a naval station. The yard con? sists of seven new large buildings and nome repairing and machinery shope, all dam? aged by the bombardment of September 23. During the morning of December 10, the navy transported Major Spence's com? mand from Olangapo to the town of Subig' five miles distant. The enemy was seen deserting Subig as the troops landed, and the latter occupied it without resistance. They found the place abandoned by the retreating enemy, who fired a few shots. The Americans deployed to the right and left of the town and killed one of the enemy. General Grant and the remainder of his command arrived at Olangapo yesterday afternoon. He will proceed today to Su? big and join Major Spence. General Grant will move north along the coast and will effect a juncture with the Twenty-fifth In? fantry under Colonel Andrew S. Burt, who was reported eight miles from Iba, Decem? ber 7. The enemy encountered in General Grant's advance fled to the mountains and scattered. General Grant is now garrison? ing the town he occupies. No casualties ore reported in his command. Washington, December 11.?The follow? ing otblegram has been received at the Navy Department from Admiral Watson telling of the part played by the navy in the occupation of Subig Bay : "Main*, December 11.?On the ntorn inz of the 9th about 11 o'clock I receive.! a telegram from Schwan, asking for Mac Arthur, our co-operation with Grant's forces scattered towards Olangapo, Subig Bxy. I subtended the Charleston court o inquiry, and plaited tlie same evening foi Sobig with the Baltimore, Oregou und s company of marines from ;lie barrack?. We arrived at daylight on the lOih, with landing parties organized. Found Major Stevens in pot-session of Olangapo, having arrived at dark on the 9th. Relieved the army forces by 100 marines, Myers com? manding. Transported the army detach? ment to Snblg. The town was abandoned on our arrival. Grant arrived in the af? ternoon. We left the Oregon, (he Gardaijui and the Mindoro and returned to Cavite on the 11th. The Olangapo navy ma? chinery is in fair condition, the shops lamaged only by previous attack." GERMANY AND EXPANSION. Count Von Buelow Explains the Aspira? tions of the Empire. Berlin, December 11.?During the de jate on the estimates of the Reichstag to lay, Prince Hohenlohe, the Imperial Jhaneelior, announced that the federal ?overnments bad come to the conclusion ;hat the present nnvy was insufficient for ;he country's needs and that estimates for loubling the present number of warships ivould be submitted. He added that the period within which :he increase of the navy would be effected Aas not to be fixed by law, the number of lew ships to be provided annually in the estimates being decided in accordance with the budgetary requnetrents. Count Von Buelow, in supporting the proposed increase in the navy, said : "The President of the United States in iis message expressed himself concerning ;he good relations between the United Stales and ourselves with a warmth that ills us with sincere satisfaction, and as fai? ls Great Britain is concerned we are wili? ng and ready to live in peace and concord ivith her on the basin of full reciprocity ind reciprocal consideration." Alluding to the warlike changes and evelations of the past few years, he said : 'I cannot yet believe that a new partition )f the earth is imminent. We wisii to in lerfere with no foreign power, but we do lot wish to let our face be troddden upon [>y any foreign power, nor let ourselves be pushed aside either politically or economi? cally. The powerful vitality of the Ger I /an people has involved us in the world's Administration and drawn us into the world's policy. In the presence of a gi elit? ?r Britain ami a new Fiance, we have claims to a greater Germany, not in the |' ;ense of conquest, but in the peaceful ex? tension of our trade and points of support ".lust because the external position is oow favorable we must use it to insure our-11 selves for the future. 1 wish, we all wish, that our future may be peaceful; whether it will be so, no one can say. We must be ?ecured against surprise, not only on land but at sea. We must create and possess a fleet strong enough to exclude attack by iny power, and 1 emphasize attack, for in ;he absolute peacefulness of our policy, it Ban never be other than a question of de? fense. We must not forget that our center is Europe. We do not neglect our duty in providing security for our possessions, which rests on the Dreibund." 

TAYLOR IS INAUGURATED. Claims Victory Was over a "Remorseless Partisan Machine." Frankfort, Ky., December 12.?William S. Taylor was inaugurated as Governor at noon. The crowd was much smaller than in past years, due to the weather, which up till last night was rainy, followed today by a December blizzard. The inaugural cere? monies were simple. Retiring Governor Bradley in the course of his speech said that lie hoped the Goe bel election law, which had brought so much turmoil to the State, would be wiped from the. statute books. Governor-elect Taylor in bis inaugural address said : "The verdict rendered by the people last November was the mandate of the people in favor of civil liberty. It was the triumph of the people over a merci? less, remroseleSS partisan machine, erect? ed to enslave them." He said one of the chief aims of his ad? ministration would be to secure the repeal of the election law. The oath of office was administered to Governor Taylor at noon by Chief Justice Haxelrigg. The lately defeated Democratic candi? date for St.tte ofhees began serving no? tices of contests today against the Uepub lican candidates who were awarded certifi? cates of election last week.

He was immediately put to bed and physicians sent for, but nothing could be done for his relief, and he died Satin day morning at 0 o'clock. The cause of his death was kidney tronble. The deceased was a member of the Methodist Church, having united with that branch of the Church some seven or eight years ago. Funeral services were held in the Methodist church at 2 o'clock Sunday afternoon. At the conclusion of these services the remains were taken to the new cemetery for interment.

The revival meetings which were com? menced in the Baptist church on the 4th inst. have been continued up to the pres? ent time, but will close with tomorrow's 11 o'clock service. Dr. P. T. Hale, of Boanoke, Va., who has Leen conducting the meetings has proved a very attractive und successful preacher. Each morning and night the church building has been crowded or filled with a deeply interested congregation, and a number of persons,, of both sexes, have professed conversion. On Wednesday morning at 11 o'clock a special service was held for the children and young persons of the town, and ali the schools were dismissed to attend the meet? ing?the pupils of the High School and also of the College, attended in a body.

Tomorrow nicht Dr. Hale will deliver a lecture in the Baptist church, in which he will tell of what he saw on a recent visit to tiie Holy Land.

The December Urin of the circuit court .of Tazewell county is not yet ended, though tlie jury was discharged several days ago. On last Saturday the case of Hylton va Norfolk and Western Railroad was finally determined by the jury bringing in a ver? dict for the defendant company. The case had been tried three times before, and three times there had been a hung jury. Miss Rosa Ilyltcn, the plaintiff, had sued the defendant compauy for live thousand dollars damages, for an alleged injury re? ceived on one of its trains at Pocabontas. At this last trial the counsel for the Nor? folk & Western asked that a physical ex? amination of the plaintilf be made by four physicians, and selected Drs. Gillespie, Crockett, Gilde:sleeve and Pierce. The court granted the motion, the plaintiff submitted to the examination, and it was upon the testimony of these physician that the defendant won the case.

EDITORIAL PARAGRAPHS. it is a close race now between Bryanit-m and Aguinaldoism as to which shall play out first. That was a terrible blow the Boers in? flicted upon i he British at Stormberg, and will prolong the war. Carl Schurz is threatening to go on the stump next year for the Democratic candi? dates. From such a calamity that party should pray to be delivered. The increase in wages of mill operatives still continues in all sections of the Union, though the gold standard has been prac? tically adopted. Prophet Bryan has been again discounted. Senator Daniel is again engaged in trying to rake up that old chestnut claim of Virginia against the United States Govern? ment for money expended by the State during the war of 1812. The estimated production of cotton in the Southern States this year is 9,000,000 bales. With the good prices now being paid for that staple, there ought to be plenty of money in the South. What is pronounced a very rigid anti? trust bill has been introduced in both Houses of the Virginia Legislature. It is safe to say that it contains no provision which will reach the "officeholders trust." Some of our Democratic contemporaries speak of President McKinley as a timid man. Some persons are unable to dis? tinguish caution from timidity. Democ? racy is in the habit of doing foolish, reck? less things, and considers those who do not follow its example as timid persons. Senator Mason, of Illinois, is making himself ridiculous by urging the United Slates Senate to pass a resolution expressing sympathy for the Boers in their war with Great Britain. He is the same gentleman who has been so ashamed of our Govern? ment because of its treatment of Aguinaldo. During the debate on the new currency bill in the House of Representatives on the 11th inst., Mr. Dolliver, of Iowa, recalled Mr. Bryan's prophecy that the gold stan? dard could not be enacted without a uni? versal fall of prices. He then asked : "Is there a man in this chamber who will rise in his place and say that Mr. Bryan knew what he was talking about." Not a Demo? crat rose, Mr. Dolliver paused, reiterated bis question, and then said : "It is then confessed that in a question which goes to the hesrt of the controversy, Mr. Bryan lacked wisdom." Mr. Roberts, the director of the mint, in his annual report to Congress, states that the mints and assay offices operated upon more bullion in the aggregate, and a great? er coinage was executed during the fiscal year than in any previous year. The coin? age of gold was the greatest in our history, amounting to $108,177,180. He also re* ports that the stock of gold bullion is ac? cumulating, and that the pressure for sub? sidiary coinage cannot be reduced. The stock of silver bullion for subsidiary coin? age, he says, has been exhausted. He calls for legislative authority for new coin* 'age of subsidiary coins.
