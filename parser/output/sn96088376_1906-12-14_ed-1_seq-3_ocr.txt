Canral CoiBuur Bootlon 3433 of the coda of Ore gon provide! as follows: Tlie county eoart, l ant general aloe tioo to be held In any county alter the passsga ol this act, npon the presents tlon ol a petition tlg-ntd by one hondrvd or more qualified elentori, Ui payers ol ad county, must inbuilt the question ol establishing and maintaining a eoun t high school to the qnallfled electors thereol. The county court, If they deem It eipedlent, uiay order a epeclal election lor such purpose. 8uch else tlon (hall be conducted In the manner provided by law lor conducting election. The ballots lor such election eliall con tain the word: "For County High School Ym;" "For County High School No," and the volar shall Indi cate his choice ai provided In the Aus tralian ballot law. 8134. If a majority of all votee cast on the proposition to establish a county high echool are In the affirmative, it hall be the duty of the county court, within thirty naye attar canvaanlng (aid vote, to locate said echool In some suit able and convenient place In eaid scanty, e e e a n pursuance ot this section thp establishment of a County High School in Gilliam County was submitted to the voters at the gen eral election last June and was voted upon afllrmativly by, the majority of the electors in the county. The County Court was triable to agree as to the location of the instiluation, eaoh of the three members voting for its loca tion at his particular place of res idence As a result Gilliam County is without a high school, with no prospects for securing one until the next election and in all proba bility at that time the court will again be unable to agree as to the question of its looation. We under stand that the same conditions ex ists in Jaokson and Union counties. If this be the case the State Legi slature could surely have no ob jection to atniuending the above mentioned sections and proving that the question of the location of the school be submitted to the voters of the oounty. It occurs to us that the State Senator frdtu this sensorial district resides in Condon and that an amendment to the sections refered to above would re sult in much good to his home town and to the county at large. We have no reoolleotion of his doing anything in the past for Con don, Gilliam County orchis sentor ial district except in his vain at tempt to square himself with the liquor interests by securing the passage of the city charter for Condon at the laet session of the legislature. There was no opposi tion to his city charter bill and the proposed amendment would also in all probability pass both houses without a disenting vote. It would be good politioa for him to do some thing; at the' next session of the legislature. His oonstituants de mand it. If he hasn't - nerve enough to introduoe the bill him self, perhaps be could prevail upon one of bit colleague to do it in his behalf. L ...-JJ In bis recent message to Congress President Roosevelt struck a popu lar chord when he recommended the enactment of a law providing for a graduated inheritance tax. Practically the only source of rev enue for the maintenance of the federal government, said the Presi dent, ia the tariff on imports and internal revenue.' Therefore be proposes that a tax be levied by the federal government on every gift, bequest and deviae in propor tion o the amount of the inheri tance. By this means the govern ment would obtain a source of rev enue which would help consider ably to defray government expen ses. Id spite of the opposition of the stand patters in the in the re publican party the tariff on many articles imported into the United States will ultimately be reduced. If the republican party does not see fit to make the change the democratic will do so and such a reduction will also materially re duce our source of revenue.. The proposed tax upon inheritances would more than cover the loss of revenue ocasioned by the reduction of the tariff and it can hardly be said that it would work a greater hardship upon the recepient of the inheritance than the present tariff schedule which in many cases has undoubtedly sheltered monopoly, at the expense of the individual consumer. fret esslonal Directory llll AM
