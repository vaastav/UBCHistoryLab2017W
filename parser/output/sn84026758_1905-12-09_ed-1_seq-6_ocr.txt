Governor Warfield and ex-Govemor Jackson have declared for Sen. Moore for President of the Senate, anil it is generally conceded that with this in fluence and the following of ex-Gover nor Smith combined, all doubt of Mr. Moore's election has been swept away. Governor Warfield said: “1 am not going into jxvlitioal com binations or playing politics, but I will say that 1 would like to see Colonel Moore made President of the Senate, lb- is a good man and well qualified to fill the place. Furthermore, I believe he will be elected.” Mr. Jackson has gone South on busi ness. but before leaving on Tuesday he said: "I shall use all the influence I possess to secure the honor for Senator Moore.” Knowing politicians say that Jackson and Smith have buried the hatchet and will, in the future, be found pulling together. THE 

MESSAGE. The President's message is a very readable document. There is so much of the President’s personality in it. and there is so little of time-honored forms of official expression, that it has rather the effect of a speech or a letter than a State paper. Among the evils to be corrected he mentions over-capitaliza tion. He urged more perfect regula tion of railroads, beacuse he is opposed to public ownership, and believes that this can be averted only by preventing what are now common wrongs. That private car lines, refrigeration, terminal roads, elevators and all other adjuncts of the transportation business should be under the same control as same the railroads is insisted upon, and excessive as well as discriminating rates must be prevented. The requirement of block signals is advised. In the interest of labor there are sug gestions regarding the protection of railway employees and employers lia bility and the investigation of the con dition of women in industrial establish ments; but there are no specific recom mendations. In regard to “government by injunction,” the President is positive that the right of the Courts to issue injunctions in labor disputes should not be prohibited, but suggests hearing Imth parties before an injunction shall lie issued. Whether insurance companies can he brought under Federal control without an amendment to the Constitution he refers to the consideration of Congress. The tariff being a subject on whicn the Republican party is divided, his refer ence to it is brief and colorless; he in vites Congress to consider whether the maximum and minimum tariff may not be a good thing. He favors economy except in the navy and the Panama Canal. Yet as to the navy he is sur prisingly moderate, in view of his pre vious expressions and the recommenda tions of Secretary Bonaparte. For the present he thinks the navy large enough, and would only add a battleship a year, maintaining practically the present num ber of units, but replacing obsolete ves sels with modern ones. He points out the lack of elasticity in the currency and advises remedial legis lation, and one of the most important of his recommendations is the public ac counting of campaign funds. The pro tection of neutral rights and property at sea is urged. He has a very poor opinion of the extension of the coast wise laws to Philippine shipping, and advises the postponement of the appli cation of the law till litOA, if it is to he applied at all. In regard to subsidies he merely commends the report of the Merchant Marine Commission to the at tention of Congress. He asks that citizenship be conferred on the Porto Iticians and in the interest of the de velopment of our islands he advises that the granting of franchise !m* per mitted. I‘hiladrlf‘liiu lire.ml.
