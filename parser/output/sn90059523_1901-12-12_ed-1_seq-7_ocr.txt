MINNEAPOLIS NEWS PICKETT IS GUILTY ■•'• JURY, AFTER £ BEING OUT FOUR TEEN HOURS, RETURNS 7 VERDICT DEFENDANT IS UNMOVED Motion May Be Made for a New Trial — Verdict Is a "Surprise to 'Many. "We the jury find the defendant guilty J f manslaughter in the first degree." These were the words that were slowly and clearly :read by Clerk Ryberg - in 'Judge Elliott's court yesterday morning in the presence of " a large. crowd that had assembled in anticipation of a return of a verdict in the case of the state against Reuben C. Pickett, tried for mur der in the first degree. . ~ .. ' The "jury had been out just fourteen hours, and their appearances- indicated that they had spent the greater part of the time -while in., the, jury room wrest ling with the solemn problem. When the jury slowly filed into the court room it could be plainly seen by their countenances that a verdict of ac quittal had not been reached. They all looked straight ahead,. and their manner was serious. The defendant, Pickett, was present, as -were also his wife, sister, father and mother-in-law. The words, as they fell from Clerk Ryberg's lips, apparently had no effect on the defendant, as he no doubt had pro-pared himself for the worst. He heard the verdict read, and not a muscle of his face moved, and when it was over he arose and followed the jailer out to his cell, and was ap parently the least disturbed of any in the room. . .7. His wife was ten^fporarily . shocked when she heard the reading of the ver dict, but outside of a somewhat dazed . look for a few moments she took the ; matter calmly. - His mother-in-law, who no doubt believed that he would be ac quitted, was probably the most over come" by. the announcement, and as she sank back in her seat half fainted away, but was soon resuscitated and able to leave the ' room. His father and sister had prepared themselves for. the worst, and -beyond a slight nervousness - took everything in a matter-of-fact manner. His attorney, ' Mr. Chamberlain, was not present at the reading of the verdict. .It is expected : that he will make a /mo tion for a new trial. Trie prisoner was remanded to jail, and now waits sen tence. .■.■■■'■ - The verdict was somewhat of a sur prise, as many had made up.their minds that it would be. an impossibility to ' prove him guilty, arguing that after a lapse -of fourteen months it would be impossible to produce testimony that could in any way connect the defendant with the murder of his wife. "" Pickett expects that a new trial wiil be granted him, and is anxious to have the judge fix the amount of bail necessary to procure his' release while the matter of new trial is pending. It is j not likely that Judge Elliott will consider the charge a bailable one, so there is very little hope of Pickett getting his liberty even temporarily. 

DEMOCRATS LAY PLANS. County Committee 7in the Future Will Conduct Entire Campaign.' A meeting of theHennepin county Demo cratic committee was held last evening. The committee that was appointed about a month ago to confer with the county committee was present, and the matter of reorganization that was talked of some time ago, was taken up and thoro oughly discussed. The trouble in the past has been that the county committee seemed- to think that it should take no part in the prim* v ary campaign, claiming that it was no part of its duties, and that Its work was "" feimply to carry oiTthe campaign of elec tion after the candidates had been noml lated. This was regarded as a great mistake, as many candidates in seeking to get the nomination at the primaries tvorked to the detriment of the party as a whole, and in the interest of some particular candidate. " ~ ■ v ' \ The contention has been that the coun ty committee should assume control of the entire campaign, beginning with the primaries and continuing through until -after the election and by doing this the best interests of the party would be con served. •-•■ : ■;- > __ In order to do this it will be necessary to have a general meeting of the entire lommittee sometime in April so that all "plans can be made for a well formulated \nd aggressive campaign. The meeting ast night was executive and all reporters Vere barred, but harmony and good feei ng prevailed. The idea was to get to gether and work enthusiastically in the Interest of the party as a whole, and not for any particular office or candidate. The Democrats of Hennepin county are beginning to realize fully that they have the opportunity of their . lives to mal'.-j a showing in the county next fall. ' Campaign material is being made for them every day by Republican office holders, that certainly will do them much good, provided they are prepared and organized thoroughly to take advantage of It, and they are early commencing to lay their plans. -;>-7i HAD 'NARROW ESCAPE.

'7 '•*,"-; Sugar Decision n Mistake. "In my judgment our decision on the Russian sugar- bounty question was "a great mistake. On the steamer In which I ! made the trip from Nagasaki to 7 Via -. clivostok there were 700. tons of American farming machinery, orders "for which had been', given prior! to the raising of the sugar question, and all of this was des tined to Eastern, Siberia and Manchuria. It was the opinion of every consul in that part of the world whom I met and of every American merchant, from the Pa cific coast to St." Petersburg, that the or ders for American - machinery ' had prac tically stopped, arid that hereafter" they would be taken by German manufactur ers; indeed, this was being done when _ was there. 7, :■"'.-.-' -- .:'..•>.; 7: .. 7*.>r "The country, from Vladivostok north through Manchuria and down the valley of the Amur, is wonderful in* its fertility, and In a few years, owing to Its rapid colonization, will become a great source of the wheat supply of the world! It seemed for 6.C00 miles of the journey as if we were traveling through Minnesota or Nebraska.. This would be an "almost illimitable market for the agricultural and mining machinery which we are ca pable of supplying. .. -7. - - Kind Feeling lor Americans. "The people are kindly disposed toward the Americans, and we ought to sell them what they want, and up to that decision the advantages were all in our favor. Russia has a peculiar;way, by executive Order, of making her - tariffs vary accord ing to the circumstances of the situation. For example/the duty on tea is much less at Vladivostok than at Odessa, -the object being to have tea come ,in at an eastern port and furnish freight for the Trans-Siberian railroad,! rather v than go by water around: by India,. through | the Suez canal into the Black sea, to be landed at Odessa. As with tea, so- prac tically with everything else;; this 7 rule has acted as a preferential tariff' In fa vor of American products by way of San Francisco and the Pacific ocean. - "This, sugar bounty decision was the result of a divided opinion by the three appraisers, Mr. Tichenor holding that the rebate of tax was not a bounty, Mr. Someiville . and Mr. Fischer disagreeing with him. - I did not find a man :in Rus sia, either an American or a native, who did riot agree with" Mr. Tichenor. The case is almost exactly parallel V with, our treatment of the alcohol question, and I do not believe 7 that .anyone would : claim that the United States government, be cause it rebated the \ tax on S alcohol■" for export thereby paid a bounty -on 7 export trade. The interests involved indirectly are infinitely; mere .important than the sugar question Is 01 ever can be.
