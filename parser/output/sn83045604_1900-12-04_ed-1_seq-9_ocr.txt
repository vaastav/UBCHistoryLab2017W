The United States, while* not participating In the Joint ?2. l ? 5? n " i tr m » P rnn, Ptly sent from the Philippines all that could e spared for service on the Chinese coast. A small force of marines was landed at Taku and sent to poking for the protection of 'ne American legation. Other powers took similar action, until some men were assembled In the capital as legation guards. ©Hi the peril increased The legations reported the development of the seditious movement In Peking and the need of in- SKSfed provision for defense against it. \> hlle preparations were in progress for a larger expedition to strengthen the le gation guards and keep the railway open, an attempt of the foreign ships to make a landing at Taku was met by fire from the Chinese forts. Tie forts wen there upon shelled by the foreign vessels the American admiral taking no part in the attack, on the ground that we were not at war with China and that a hostile demonstration might consolidate the anti-foreign elements and strengthen the Boxers to oppose the relieving column. Two days later the Taku forts were cap tured after a sanguinary conflict. Sev erance of communication with Peking followed, and a combined force of addi tional guards which was advancing to Peking by the Peiho was checked at Kangfang The isolation of the legations was complete. The MPRP nnd Belief. Tho shfgc and the relief of the lega tions have passed into undying history In all the stirring chapters which record the heroism of the devoted band, cling ing to hope in the face of despair, and the undaunted spirit that led their re llevers through battle and suffering to the goal. It is a memory of which mv countrymen may be justly proud, that the honor of our flag was maintained alike in the siege ann the rescue, ami that stout American hearts have again set high In fervent emulation with true men of other race and language th»- in domitable courage that ever strives for the cause of right and Justice By June h the legations were cut off An identical note* from tho yamen or dered each minister to leave Peking, un der a promised escort, within twenty four hours.

Rein rorcements sent by all the co-operating gmernments were constantly arriving. 1 net nited States contingent, hastily as sembled from the Philippine* or dispatrh -n«f rom th ' w country, amounted to some a,two men, under the able command of the lamented Col. Liscum and afterward of Gen. Chaffee. Tlie Fornnrd >lo% eraent. Toward the end of July the movement began. A severe conflict followed at Tien tsin, in which Col. Llacum was killed. The city was stormed and partly de stroyed. its capture afforded the base of operations from whlcM to make the final advance, which began In the first days of August, the expedition being made up of Japanese, Russian, British and American troops at the outset. Another battle was fought and won at langtsun. Thereafter the. disheartened < hlnese troops offered little show of re sistance A few days later the Important position of llosiwoo was taken. A rapid march brought the unit»*d forces to the populous city of Tungchow, which capitu lated without a contest. On August 14 the capital was reached. After a brief conflict beneath the wall, the relief column entered and the lega tions were saved. The United States sol diers. sailors and marines, officers and men alike. In those distant climes and un usual surroundings, showed the same valor, discipline and good conduct and gave proof of the same high degree of In telligence and efficiency which have dis tinguished them in every emergency. The imperial family and the govern ment had fled a few days before The city was without visible control. The re maining imperial soldiery had made on the night of the I.lth a last attempt to ex terminate' the besieged. which was gal lantly repelled. It tell to the occupying forces to restore order and organize* provisional administration. Happily the ucute disturbances were confined to the northern provinces. It is a relief to recall and a pleasure to record the loyal con duct of the viceroys and local authorities of the southern and eastern provinces Their efforts were continuously directed to the pacific control of the*vast popula tions under their rule and to the scrupu lous observance of foreign treaty rights. At critical moments they did not hesitate to memorialize the throne, urging the protection of the legations, the restora tion of communication and the assertion '»f the Imperial authority against the. sub versive elements They maintained excel lent relations with the official representa tives of foreign powers. To their kindly disposition is largely due the success of the consuls In removing many of the mis sionaries from the Interior to places of safety Tn this relation the action of the consuls should be highly commended. In Shangtung and Eastern <*h!U the task was difficult, but. thanks to their energy and the co-operation of the American and foreign naval commanders, hundreds of foreigners, Including those of either na tionalities than ours, were rescued from imminent peril. Policy off I nlted State*. The policy Of the United States through al| this trying period was clearly an nounced and scrupulously carried out. A circular note to the powers, dated July 13, proclaimed our "attitude, treating the condition In the north as one of virtual anarchy, In which the great provinces of the south and southeast had no share. We regarded the local authorities in the latter quarters as representing the Chi nese people, with whom we sought to re main in peace and friendship. Our de clared «ln»s involved no war against tho Chinese nation. We adhered to the legit imate office of rescuing the imp'riled legation, obtaining redress for wrongs al ready suffered, securing wherever possi ble the safety of American life and prop erty In China, ami preventing a spread of the disorders or their recurrence. An was then said. "The policy of the government off the United States is to i-eek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial administra tive entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and interna tional law. and safeguard for the world the principle of th« >«tual and Impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese em pire." Faithful to th»s, professions, which, as It proved reflected the vires and pur poses off the other co-operating govern ments. all «*ur efforts have been directed toward ending the anomalous situation In China bv negotiations ffor a settlement at the earliest possible moment. As so.ui as ths sacred duty of relieving our legation and It-* dependents was accomplished we Withdrew from active hostilities, leaving our legation under an adequaie guard tn Peking as a channel of negotiations and settlement a course adopter| by others of the Interested powers Overtures off the empowered representatives of the Chines* tmpr.tr have been considerately enter i Tie Russian proposition looting to the restoration of the Imperial power In IV kin# I|»» *'• «» ««• 'i>;-\ *?£ mony with our own desires. «or we »»%• held and h.ld thai effective reparation for wrongs suffered and an enduring tiemcnt that will make their recurrence imp* slble can best be bnmghi < about un der AM authority which the < bines- na tion reverences and obeys I: g we forego no lot >f our undoubted Tl«»« .W,"'- 1 ' r .m!«M»wn!

Measured In money alone, a suffi cient reparation may prove to be t»eyond the ability of China to meet. All the powers concur in emphatic disclaimers "f any purpose of aggrandisement through the dismemberment of the em pire. I am disposed to think that due compensation may be made in part by Increased guarantees of security for for eign rights and immunities, and most tm portant •{ .ill by uho opening of Chin* to the equal commerce of all the worla. Then View* have been and Will he earn estly advocated by our representatives. The government of Russia has put for ward a suggestion that in the event of protracted divergence of views In regard to the indemnities, the matter may be relegated to the court of irbltration at The Hague. T favorably incline to this, believing that high tribunal could not fall to reach a solution no less con ducive to tho stability and enlarged pros perity of China itself than immediately beneficial to the powers. OUR 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. Treaties Hxclinitited mal Difference* Adjusted Are Keclted 111 Detail. Ratifications of a treaty of extradition with the Argentine Republic were ex changed on June 2 last. While the Austro-Hungarian govern ment has in the many oases that have been reported of the arrest of our natu ralized citizens for alleged evasion of mil itary service faithfully observed the pro visions of the treaty and released such person* from military oMUntftoas. ,■lt has In some instances expelled thoss whose presence In* the community of their origin was asserted to have pernicious Influence. Representations have been made against this course whenever Its adoption has ap peared unduly onerous. We have been urgently solicited by Bel glum to ratify the international conven tion of June, amendatory of the pre vious convention of 1 M«» in reaped to the regulation of the liquor trade in Africa. Compliance was necessarily withheld, in the absence of the advice and consent of the senate thereto. The principle involved has the cordial svmpsYhy of this govern ment, which, in the revlslonary negotia tions. advocated more drastic measures, and I would gladly see its extension, by International agreement, to the restric tion of the liquoy traffic with all uncivil ized peoples, especially in the Western Pacific. A conference will be held at Brussels December 11, 11<00» under the convention for the protection of industrial property, concluded at Paris, March 3D, 18K3. to which delegates from this country have been appointed.

One manufacturer after another had to he visited and importuned and at time*, after a promise to exhibit In a particular section having heen obtained, it would be withdrawn, owing to pressure of trade orders, and a new quest would have to be made. The installation of exhibits, too, en countered many obstacles and involved unexpected cost The exposition was far from ready at the date fixed for its open ing. The French transportation lines were congested with offered freight. Be lated goods had 50 be hastily installed unfinished quarters, with whatever labor could bo obtained in the prevailing eon fusion. Nor was the task of the commis sion lightened by the fact that owing to the scheme of class!ft atlon adopted it was impossible to have th** entire exhibit of any one country in the same build ing. or more than one group «>f exhibits in the same part of any building. Our installations were scattered on both sides of the Seine and in widely remote sub urbs of Paris so that additional assist ants were needed for the work of super vision and arrangement. Creditable Dlafilay. Despite all these drawbacks the contri bution of the United States was not only the largest foreign display, hut was among the earliest in place and the most orderly in arrangement. Our exhibits were shown in 101 out of 121 classes, and more com pletely covered the entire classification than those of any other nation, in to tal number they ranked next after those of France, and the attractive form In which they were presented secured gen eral attention. A criterion of the extent and success of our participation and of the thorough ness with which our exhibits were or ganized is seen in the awards mantel to American exhibitors by the interna tional jury, viz : Grand prizes. 24<v gold medals. W7; silver medals. 776. bronze mi-dals, ,>ll. and honorable mentions, 322 2.476 in all. being the greatest total num ber given to the exhibit of any exhibit ing nation, as well as the largest num ber In each grade. This significant recognition of merit In competition with the chosen exhibits of all other nations, and at the hands of juries almost wholly made up of repre sentatives of France and other compet ing countries, i* not only most gratify ing, but Is especially valuable since It sets us to the front in International ques tions of supoly and demand while tha large proportion of awards in the classes of art and artistic manufactures afforded unexpected proof of the stimulation of national culture bv the prosperity that flows from natural productiveness join ed to industrial excellence. Aside from the exposition, several op portunities for showing international good will occurred. The Inauguration at Paris of the monument presented by the school children of the United States and the designing of a commemorative medal at our mint and the presentation of the first piece struck to the president of the republic were marked by appro priate ceremonies, and the Pourth of Julv was especially observed In the French capital. llelntloiiM Willi ((frmany.

Tnllulnli Lynching 1 * In my last message I referred at con siderable length to the lynching of five Italians at Tallulah Notwithstanding the efforts of the federal government, th«- production of evidence tending to in cuipate the authors of ihls grievous of fense against our civilisation; and the repeated inquests set on foot by the au thorities of the state of Louisiana, no punishments have followed. Successive grand juries have failed to indict The representations of the Italian government In tho face of this miscarriage have been most temiterate and just. Setting the principle at issue high above all considerations of met, ly pecuniary in demnification. such as this government made in the three previous cases. Italy has solemnly invoked the pledges of ex isting treaties, and asked that the Jus tice to which she is entitled shall be meted in regard to her unfortunate countrymen In our territory, with the same full meas ure >he herself would Kive to any Ameri can were his reciprocal treaty rights con temned. „ 1 renew the urgent recommendations I made last year that congress appro priately confer upon the federal courts jurisdiction' In this class of International cases, where the ultimate responsibility of the federal government may IK- in volved, and I invite action upon the bills to accomplish this which were introduced in the senate and house Incumbent upon this to retK'W th»- statutory omissions which has led. and may again lead, to such untoward results. I have pointed out the necessity and the precedent for legislation of this character. Its enact ment is a simple measure of previsoty Justice toward the nations with which we, as a sovereign equal, make treaties re quiring reciprocal observance. While the Italian government naturally regards such action as the primary, and, Indeed, the most essential element in the poi ii of tii' Tallulah Incident.*i advise that, in accordance with precedent, and in view of the improbability of that par ticular case being reached by the bill now pending, congress make gracious pro visions for indemnity to the Italian suf ferers in the same form and proportion as heretofore. in ni> Inaugural I referred to the gen eral subject of lynching in these words: "Lynching must not be t' leratcd In -1 great and civilized country like the Unit ed States; courts, not mobs, must execute the penalties of the law Ihe preserva tion of public order, the right of dis cussion, the Integrity of courts, and tho orderly administration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety on which our government security rests " This I most urgently reiterate and again Invite the attention of my countrymen to this reproach upon our civilization. •In|inn'n \d % a iieemr lit.
