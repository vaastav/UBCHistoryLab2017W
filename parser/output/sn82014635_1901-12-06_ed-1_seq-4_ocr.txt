The balance of political power now lies -west of the Mississippi, and the time is about passed when the At lantic coast can rob the frontier in the name of equity and liberty. Hides and hay of the west are as much entitled to protection as the products of New England, but the robbers and muslin-makers of the Atlantic coast would never concede 1L Those fellos want free South Amer ican hides and then to charge us westerners a high protec tive price for their boots, the raw material of which they were made costing only the shipping price. They want our hides at the like price,, -with the tail and horns thrown in. That combine of eastern congressmen demand annual appropriations for dredging creeks, for scooping harbors out of unfrequented sloughs and bayous, and millions for port improvements. Any appropriation asked by the west or evenly any portion of the interior has been held to be a presumption. But the old line-up of the Atlantic coast has opened its eyes to the fact that it can no longer indulge in its ancient annual gobble without the consent of that portion of the interior west which has no ship yards' to maintain, and no creeks to dredge. Hereafter there is going to be a quiet pro quo. The west has got a ranchman for President, who having been a cowboy knows hides to be a suitable article for the protective tariff tariif schedule not only, but who believes in making tvro blades of grass grow where but one grew before, even if it has to be done by Irrigation, provided for by, and in the same bill, which appropriates public monies to make a southern bayou a navigable river and the mouth of an Atlantic coast creek a L arbor. Tn-pired. no doubt, or warranted, by the practical words of the President's message, touching the claims and ad vantages of irrigation, the member of the Sixth congres sional district of Kansas has introduced a bill appropriat ing a quarter of a million of dollars for digging wells and making ponds in his district This nervy action should be tiii plicated by all the congressmen of all the districts of wi-strn Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona. Western Kansas, Northern Texas, Oklahoma ar.i Southern California, to the end that the Atlantic and Gu!f roast congressman may bo brought to realize that th-re "is a God in Israel" when next they seek to break iro th" national treasury with their river and harbor crowbar. they cannot do under existing relations. Highly protect ed industries should no longer be permitted to sell more cheaply to foreigners than to their own countrymen. Fit &nd thorough relief can be had only by amendment of the present tariff act But we shall favor such reciprocity treaties as will reduce, even if they do not altogether re move the unfair and oppressive burden of the present sys tem." This is prcisely in line with the policy laid down by the lamented McKinley in the city of Buffalo, and just what the rank and file of the Republican party throughout the land have endorsed, and what a large proportion of the party's representatives in congress are believed to stand for. Republicans are also agreed in favor of "just and generous treatment of Porto Rico and Cuba," and to be lieve that "American obligations to Cuba should be sac redly performed." Had Republicans been drawing the resolutions they might have changed the wording in them in some minor particulars, but as a whole they seem to be pretty good Republican doctrine. No doubt there are still some differences between the Democratic and Republican parties, but so far as the res olutions introduced In the Democratic caucus are con cerned, they do not show any very marked divergences in policy. THE 

STATE'S BINDING TWINE PLANT. Warden Jewett of the state penitentiary, has gone to Yucatan, in South America, to buy sissal to make binding twin" njxt year. Tb Eagle hap from the first doubted the wisdom of tho &tate binding twine plant Not that it conflicted with any labor interest of the state, but from the fact that, in th- f rst place, such an enterprise offered too many open ings for leakages and in the second place that the invest ment of money necessary is wholly out of proportion to tho number of mpn required to run it The first Te qtiihifv of satisfactory penal servitude and state imprison m rt is abundant and healthful employement The cheaper the raw material and the simpler the avocation tho loss is the expense to the state, and the greater the cLanco of profit. Judge Jewett dreaded the acceptance of the warden si, of the state penitentiary more from a fear that he Wwull be unable to make a favorable showing for that twine plant investment than from any dread of innTii.ity to straighten out the long existing crooked things running in the under current of the industrial and flnan-ci.-i! affairs of that institution. He did some decapitations and made a number of changes which enabled him to get on to expected, and to unearth the unexpected. But the greatest perplexity, a responsibility which could not be dodged was the operation of that costly binding twine plant, and the train load of left-over-twine upon his hands which must be disposed of in addition to the-product of the your, then being turned out Having figured out the lowest possible cost at which by strict economy and faith ful labor binding twine could be produced he cut the pi! e. established agencies throughout the state and suc c '-:!iy laid it over the twine trust with the result that lb' nine on hand, together with the product of the plant fc; t'i' season was all disposed of, leaving a large margin o saving to the Kansas wheat growers and a very satis fo' fory proflt for the state. v. I::'. all this is as satisfactory as true, the Eagle is luliiK d to doubt the wisdom of the legislature in I ::g M..-h an investment To say nothing of the large i t t of capital invested in the machinery, and the nec- ! es-ar.iy large amount additional for the purchase of the ra material, the responsibility to the warden and the I -han . s of leakagt s are too great and numerous. Warden I Jtw:. it is true, proved equal to such responsibility for! th- j ear last past, but being unable to buy the necessary j areount of sissal in the open market he has gone to seek it at :irt hands in Central America. He may and no doubt w ' Mueeed in procuring a satisfactory supply at the re- iar market price. But in the event of a failing mar k r n squeeze or corner by the twine trust, loss might l ;red. Such loss, however, faithful and wise the a the warden would bo laid at the door of the state an organization as one arising, either from a lack i c nary foresight or from dishonesty or from both.! - n .a fact and in truth it would be neither. j -C I NO CHANCE FOR QUARRELING. j '.':.

AMBITION OF KAUFMAN FAMILY. "Speaking of pc-Uce stupidity and queer crimes," said th captain musingly, "re minds me of my tirst bis case, how cutely I worked it and what a failure it turned out to be from the public point of view. "Old Man Kaufman was cashier of the Dexter National "Bank, and lived in Ce dar Grove, a suburb chiefly noted for exclusive society.' Half the population kept poor trying: to cut a wide social swath, and the other half lived in plsery from envying their neighbors. "Old man Kaufman overlooked that, and was the best, perhaps-the only friend I had amongst the swells. "He had a big family, about seven children all grown young women of the high-society' kind and they didn't do a thing to the told man's finances. What with sumraei tours and winter gayeties, pink teas, soirees, theater parties and ail that sort of doings, they kept the old fellow's nose to the grindstone for true. He didn't have a thing in the world but his. home and his salary, and I don't think that was over three or four thou sand. I used to sit with him in the train pretty often, and as he was stuck on talking and I wasn't, I came to know a good deal about his affairs. "The 'black sheep' of Cedar Grove owned the house next door to Kaufman's, and the chief ambition of the cashier was to buy out his objectionable neighbor. His name was Hockburg; he was a pro fessional gambler, and his wife was what the suburbanites call 'vulgar.' Once about every -month fhe Heckburgs would have what they called a 'house party, but nobody ever came to it except a lot of flash-looking guys from town. They used to raise merry h at them parties, and you could hear the poker chips rattle AS FOR U. S. KANSAS SENATORS. A Kansas man in booming a man for the United States senate said that he possesses "in an exceptional degree all those qualities which in the past Kansas has demanded of her United States senators," and Frank Montgomery takes xeception to the gentleman's alleged qualifications as follows: "In her day Kansas has had senators who were poets and senators who were thieves. She has had fat i all night long. That made the Kaufman senators, lean senators, whiskered senators, shaven sena-1 ladies wild, and as Heckburgs' was a . . , ., , , , , , . dinky sort of .a cottage, built right up tors, and senators with bald heads. She has had swearing against Kaufman's I'M:, the old fellow, senators, psalm-singing senators, silent senators, noisy his wife and his high-toned daughters senators and senators of noble mein. Some of her sena-1 l. Kauf tors were convicted, some acquitted and some were nevers man explained to me one night, 'and I found out In her admirable galaxy there have been sen ators who never were elected and senators who, elected, could never get their seats. She has had senators who committed suicide, who committed homicide, who were married three or four times. She has had Democratic Senators, Populist senators. Republican senators and E. G. Ross. Therefore it would seem a hard standard which our Kansas contemporary has set for the new senator to come." : THE SUB-MARINE MACHINE. The submarine boat may prove of immense advantage to small powers, such as cannot build and support navies. Changes not yet hinted at in mechanical devices and sciences would be necessary to make submarine vessels available for carrying a nation's line of battle to an ene my's coast. Nor is there any reason whatever for fancy ing that boats built to run under the surface of the sea, in time of need, can be made effective for the police duty which devolves upon great powers in the wide oceans. But wrhat has been done is enough to make it very probable that a comparatively small outlay upon submarine boats will suffice to render the vicinity of any small state's coast extremely unsafe and disagreeable for the fleets of the greatest naval power which may send its ships there with hostile intent If it can be accomplished the effects will be great and far-reaching. MUST DANISH WEST INDIES BE OURS?

I'm ready for him now, though.' "And Kaufman tapped his breast and whispered, got $3,000 in my Inside pocket. Carry it there all the time, ready for Heckburg to go broke.' I told the old man that he was foolish to carry so much cash around with him, but he said Heckburg w&s one of those men that couldn't be induced to let go for anything but ready money. 'I carry it in my in side vest pocket, and nobody knows it but you and me,' he said. I was a little surprised to lenow that he bad so much cash of his own. "Of course, I didn't live in the swell part of Cedar Grove, but at that time my room wasn't more than six or seven blocks from Kaufman's. It was about 3 o'clock one winter morning, just before Christmas, when I was routed out of bed by Kaufman's coachman. . I lit the gas and let him in, and while I was dressing he told me that the old man had just been murdered. 'Taint moren't three days ago he told me if anytldng ever happened to ca!l you, and so I came here first' From the coachman's tails I learned that the first indication of trouble had come about a half-hour before, when he and the family were awakened by the report of a shotgun, followta almost im mediately by a pistol shot. "He slept in a room over the barn, but had run over to tbe house and reached the side porch before anyone in the house had appeared. He found old Kaufman lying face down, dying, on the porch floor. Ills shotgun lay beside him, and, further away, a pistol, which he sup posed must have been dropped by the burglar. When I got to the house it was ail lighted up, the' women were upstairs screaming ana going on, ana two or three neighbors, attracted by the shots, ' ALONG THE KANSAS NILE.
