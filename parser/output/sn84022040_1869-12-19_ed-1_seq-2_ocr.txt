They had at lemu'ed to do so. but were warned hv the in-urnure officers tbat a continunnre f ,ucti a course rendered it necessary to aAtertallT increase their rales of insur ance, because of tbe threats made by the K'KUt Hour class. As a result, the ten hiur men were discharged and Eigh Hour Leiguers put iu their places, while tbe contemplated factories baverome in a drad bait, as the eziortioaate lerms eitftit hour laborers will not permit capi tal to embark in snci entetpri.-es witt any chance of success. Tbe unparal It-led dem-mds of labor, coupled with the ahorrned period of daily operations have so aJvanced the prue of all ma e rils tbat enterprise has been euVc'uxlly chrvked, and if mechanics and laborers hud themselves reaping tue reward t?ieir inexcusnble fully, tuey must expe-t to bear the odium. At their doors, and theirs only, is chargeable tue perairiniis exodus which attracted the New York editor's attention The Call assumes I be the workiogman's organ, and ins'ead of having independence euough to man fully point out triors and adise them Io a better course, it pats iheni on tbe back and attacks a people which it knows to be innocent of its accusation, because it believes such conduct popular among ts subscribers. Either ibe Kigb Hour Leagues most recede from their preposterous demands, or this city will nerome aoibtng but a sonurb to Chi rago, while every interest in tbe State must languish and gradually wane out of existence.

Tbe product of oar mines will co to pay fur articles of consumption Agriculture must either be able to em ptor labor on easier terms, or i: must dwindle down to a mere cypher Rates of wages must come to ibe level of those current at tbe East. Tbe Pacific Railroads have brought oar operatives face to face with those of the Atlantic and interior States. Tbe struggle is now virtually between ibem. Those who find no employment because iney are not allowed to accept it by ibe fi ght Honr Leagues, nnder lerms that cannot be entertained, will go where thee can act freely, independently, and ant be bound band and fool, even if Ihey work for less iban ibey could ob tain co the Pacific Coast. The beg'ra of merhanics and laborers which has commenced will go on increasing in volume nnttl oor labor market is de serted But tbe scarcity will not com pel any yield' og to the ei'onionate demands of those that remain. Those who leave will be careful to spread far and wide lb reasons wbicb urged them back to Eastern Gelds, and tbe almost exertions of thousand Immigrant Union would fail to erasa or mitigate tbo malign influence of bald, staring facts n ttered by thousands or disgusted returned mechanics and laborers.

The vaults in theUui'.ed States Sub-treas ury, in New York City, two in number, are described as follows: The sides and roof are composed of eight-feet granite masonry and two feet of iron plates. Between the layers of plates are musket balls laid in loose. The flm.r is composed of thirty feet of masonry and two feet of iron plates, also with a layer of musket balls. Each vault is closed by four iron doors weighing two tons each, and fastened by two combination lucks to each door. Tbe three inner dours are locked without a key, while the locks on the outer ones are operated by means of an in strument about an inch lung by half an inch wide. Each vault is about twelve feet square. On the sides of each apartment are built 120 chests of iron, each of a capacity of a quarter of million of dollars in gold coin. Each chest, when full, is closed by an iron door and fastened with a lock which is sealed, so tliat the door cannot be tampered with without breaking the seal. CorL. It is said that coal of a fair quality has been fiund ahont 12 miles northeast of the luwersmk uftbeCarstn There are 2 stratums, about 6 teet thick, and separated hv about ti'.nt feel of slaty sands on. Not fir from ihe-e coal veins is an immense deposit of petrified wood In places along a ravine which passes through the locality, this petrified wood is to be seen piled up tu the height of six or eight feel. This wood looks as natural as though only deposited one week ago, yet it is now all sione, solid stone, roots, trunk, branches, and all kinds of curiosities are Io be found mixed in with ibis petrified wood ; as the bones of various animals and fowls, pine outs, etc. Enterprite.
