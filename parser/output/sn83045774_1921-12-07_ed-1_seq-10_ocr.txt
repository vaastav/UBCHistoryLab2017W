On June 22, when the controversy! wafc most bitter over the Irish ques-' Hon, King Georoe made a remark-1 rble speech at the opening of the1 Northern Parliament in Belfast. He< was speaking not merely to the l lstermen within the sound of his oice but to all Ireland when ho said: "T appeal to all Irishmen to pause, I to etretoh out the hand of forbearing and conciliation, to forgive and 1 to forget, and to Join in making for ! the land which they love a new era of peace, contentment and good will." And when the King said that it was his earnest desire "that in Soutli rn Ireland, too, there may ere long akc place a parallel to what is now passing in this hall," there was left no doubt of the Crown's belief that he situation, desperate as it then appeared. was not beyond hope. We may well accept the King's peech as the very beginning oS the hapter which has closed so happily. He had struck a note higher, clearer nd more human than any of his 'rime Minister's utterances, for he was speantng not as me leaaer 01 a omporary Government hut as the end of a vast empire. Irishmen remembered that speech months aftercard when hope of a settlement remed to be drowning in a sea of 'echnicalities. They remembered it gain on Monday night when, as the last glimmer of peace seemed to fade, be King again summoned Mr. Lloyd 'Ikoroe for a conference which was oon followed by an agreement beween the Government and the Sinn "'eln representatives. So. assuming that this is the end if seven centuries of her bitterness. Ireland has much to thank King horct: for. He saw. with an. 1m ifrial vision reminiscent of his ather. the chance that had come, the hance that was slipping, the chance hat might never come again or come nly after more and futile years of rebellion and bloodshed: and he anH tnnl. if This as lie saw it, was the great opportunity? not merely for England or for either ~nd of Ireland but for all of the British Empire and all of the world. An for Lloyd George, none will minimize the task he undertook, the -tubhornness with which he perseuted it or the wonderful patience h? displayed at trying moments. There were times, such as his speech t Carnarvon, when he seemed almost willing to throw the whole problem hack into chaos; but there were other times when his temperate 'reatnient of exasperating situations -aved what ground had been gained. His exchange of notes with Mr. Dr Valera in August and September is one of the most remarkable exhibits of dialectic fencing in diplomatic history. Had the rremicr been less patient the whole structure of peace negotiation would have fallen. Mr. De Valf.ra and his associates most of them more Irish in blood and characteristics than himself, must be congratulated upon obtaining for Ireland the status of a "free state." There could he, at least In this generation. no Irish republic. De Va11.ra Knew that. He tacitly admitted li when, at the close of his long and dexterous correspondence with Llotp OnoRTiK. he accepted the Prime Minister's invitation to a coftfereace 'with a view to ascertaining how me association of Ireland with the community of nations known as the British Empire may hest he reconciled with Irish national aspirations." That quoted phrase was Limn ?ifXJHOt.'s, Ingeniously designed to ; moofh over the delicate situation. And that phrase very well describes ihe outcome of the negotiations. Ire land's national aspirations are reeog nisod. She is not a republic, but she ip a free state with powers practically like those of the existing Dominions She is winning more than O'Cowr.u r Or vita* dreamed of achieving f<c. her. She Is to have liberty In greater than Pvknui or Rkdmouc ever hoped for. She does not become a separate Power, but she attains the dignity of association with the Brit ieh Empire. As the agreement stands there is a trtnlted Ireland. It lies with tHste> i to say w hether it shall remain uuitec j or he divided. The Ulster problem which seemed as baffling as that ol ! the South, finds a solution which can uot offend Ulster's dignity. She h I not to be coerced. If she chooses sh< may go her own way and content herself with such pqwers as she hai now; powers with which she has pro leased to be satisfied. It is up to th< South of Ireland, In its desire for s united Ireland, to persuade theNortl not to sever the bond. Here, then, is a victory in whict none is vanquished. Here is the first real peace in a war which has ragec for centuries and spread far beyonc the islands of the principals. It ought to be encouraging to the whoh world, which seeks peace every where, to see the seemingly lmpos sible come true. President Harding's Message. President Hahdi^o delivered t.c v wiiRicoa vcoiciuajr a inconaf>rr nunu, of remarkable interest throughout has four high peaks of Importance These are his recommendations as tc national control of strikes and other forms of industrial war, establishment of organized and cooperative selling and distributing agencies foi the farmers, support of American [shipping without discriminating du ties against foreign bottoms, and a provision for an elastic tariff system capable of meeting special emergen t ies or abnormal conditions without the uncertainties, disadvantages and dangers of the so-called American valuation scheme. The President's stand as to the control of both parties to Industrial warfare is so Just in its conception and so clear in its logic that the American public can be counted for it whether the present Congress shall be or not. "When he says there should be no question as to the right oi labor to organize, to bargain collec tively and to act together in other ways, he says no more of it than he says of organized capital and no more than is a legal fact as to organized capital. When he says organized la aa anoh should not be nermit ted to conduct itself to the injury ol the general public again he says nc more of it than he says of organized I capital and also no more than is s ! legal fact as to organized capital. And there is nobody that will fai to recognize the simplicity and forc? I of his parallel between the world now | seeking for its self-protection suit able procedure to adjust difference; ! among nations without recourse t< | war and the country also seeking for its self-protection to adjust dif ferences between organized labor ant ; organized capital "without resort t< | those forms of warfare which w< recognize under the name of strikes j lockouts, boycotts and the like." In the matter of the agricultura problem it is plain to see that th< President's heart is fervently witl ! the nation's tillers of the soil, wh labor through the year to feed th nation, only to find after the harves that it is worth little or nothing ti those who produced it by the swea j of their brow. When Mr. Harping bespeaks for th i farmers of the United States a nn tionally encouraged cooperative ma; i keting programme he suggest something which Tun Nkw Yori Herald feels is as sure to come a the rising suns of the days afte this. The sooner it comes the bette for the farms, the cities and the couri try. because the whole hangs upon th : existence and welfare of the agrlcul i tural Industry and the sturdy sot: j of America who must continue li that industry If the nation is to ccr , tinue in the path which thus far ha been its destiny. As frankly outspoken as he is t Congress about agriculture and laboi President Harding is still mor open, even hold, with his declara tion as to the Jones act, directin the Executive to give notice for th termination of existing cominereia treaties, so as to enable this countr to set up differential import charge against any goods brought to us i other than American bottoms. H tells Congress that he has not corr plied with the legislative cotnman of Congress, as President Wilson als did not comply with it. because to >1 so would "involve us in a chaos o trade relationships" and make ou Industrial and commercial trouble worse than they already are. j But the Harding Administrate Is working out 8 plan which, "thoug yet too crude to offer it," promises t save the American merchant marim Whether this is to he a subsidy, an If so in what form, the Presiden does not Intimate. Rut he doe? pron ise to submit it at an early date an does Rive assurance that its fundi mental principles are so sound thu it will commend itself to Congress b its own economic merits. Rut amotiR all these noteworth recommendations and suggestions th most striking note is the President treatment of the tariff prohlen American industry and America employment need protection froi devastation by a flood of Import that may be irresistible whether bi cause of pauper labor costs in som foreign exporting countries or hi cause of debased currency values 1 ethers. But nobody In Congress has vi i succeeded in working out a const tuttonal tariff scheme which wl reasonably equalize the cheapei labor cost article abroad with tti high Inhor cost article here at homi and yet not exclude entirely tli ' articles of other countries whose rosl of production are lower than our but very much higher than those t the very cheapest labor countr agnlnat which our tartfT rate woul he distinctly directed. I President rTunnnva suggests thi I THE NEW I Congress grant executive authority j wi . to make special tariff, duties for spe- sol r ' cial articles in special cases, his ap- "w parent desire being to approach as;to i| nearly as possible to the principle of ito J varying duties against different coun- sw t tries to put them all on the same ml i footing with our products when they j da - come here to compete with them. I J * PrflQi^Ant T-T a pntva nffAr? hla nla n m< i "the only promising alternative (to Inl i the American valuation), namely, a Qh provision authorizing proclaimed -m i American valuation under prescribed t conditions on any given list of ar- cel 1 tides Imported." 1 This would seem to answer the erf t serious objection of American Importi ers and merchants to the uncertain ties of duties to be paid under the ab' - American valuation plan. The "pro- cai claimed" duty of the President undoubtedlv would be payable only after the giving of due notice as to i ( when it would take effect. Tn this way the Importer could know when he did his buying what duty he would ^ need to pay as he scarcely ever could , know under the Fordney American . valuation plan. The President suggests, also, an ^ . amendment to the Constitution that we would prevent the future issuance of . .. trc ! all tax exempt bonds. But as such of - an amendment would have to be . i adopted by three-quarters of the wg i , States the chances of Its adoption pr look slim to The New York Herat,n. si(, in view of the fact that It would #n 1 mean dear money to the States on J>u i all borrowings. of j The President, too, made It plain tic that the tax bill recently passed by j,,j I | Congress was not satisfactory to him. jje, i and served notice on Congress that lio nVinnl/l annn nsTr fnr a hoffor ViTJl i. ?.... - ~ln, Altogether It Is an unusual message on \ ?clear, fine, strong. ta< epi Education Week. rl! ml This Is American Education Week. a(j The National Education Association tie and the American Legion, under c0' whose Joint auspices the week was Ac planned, urge the people, whether fr( as parents or as taxpayers, to in-; form themselves regarding the ac-hgl compllshments and needs of the pub- i Wc ' 11c schools. i a0i 1 The Legion and the Association have formulated a general pro- i Er 1 gramme for the improvement or i tr?

Among the original setxs were many freed or escaped nvicts from the penal colonies of istralla or New Caledonia. Almost jm the first there was a strong :alrv between the French and Briti settlers in recruiting natives for >rk on the plantations and in the tjulsltion of land.

'J14 m ? the To Thi New York Herald : Though G[ known by repute to all except the very tlei youngest, probably few erf the habitues ere of the Metropolitan Opera House had an ever heard Christine Nilsson, whose death was announced tihe other day and j?*' whose name had headed the roster of artists engaged for the Initial season. tio I remember her in Europe in the late mu '70s, but even then she had abandoned coi most of her youthful rOles, suoh ns or? Luoia, Violetta and Ophelia, for more P'a dramatic parts. Her voice at that time, though it had undoubtedly lost some thj very high notes which enabled her In the '60s to sing the music of the Queen ? of Night in "The Magic Flute," had gained in power and easily filled the auditorium. It was not at all of the Italian type, like Pattl's, but of a dis- , tlnctly northern timbre, as Jenny Lund's undoubtedly was, being heard at Its best In the Jewel Song in "Faust," wtiich has never been so brilliantly rendered save perhaps by Melba In her prime. On her last visit to America during the season of 1883-4 Nilsson appeared as Marguerite in "Faust," Margherita and Helen of Troy in "Meflstofele," Elan j , in "Lohengrin," Mignon, La Gioconda. Donna Elvira in "Don Giovanni" and ' Valentine in "Lea Huguenots." I heard j . her in all. Her impersonation of; Goethe's heroine, both in Gounod's opera | and in that of Boito, seemed to please ] the public most. As Helen of Troy she I was Incomparable, and (her queenly pres- : ence will never be forgotten by those 1 who saw her. One night at the Metro- | , politan the brief duet "La Luna Immo- ] bile," In the second part of "Meflstofele" ' ( had to be given five times, so exquisite was the art of the singers (Nilsson and j Trebelli). The duet for T.a Gioconda and Laura (Mme. Fursch-Madl) in the i < second act of Ponehlelli's opera was a! most equally tine in a omerem way. Rattl was pre-eminently a singer of Rossini's music. Xilsson was not. ' though occasionally in London she ap pcared as Desdcniona in that composer's "Otello." which has not been heard here for over half a century and should not bo confounded with Verdi's opera of the same name. She was, however, a Mozart ? specialist, having sung the rfiles of Che- 1 rubino and the Countess in "The Mar- . . riage of Figaro," the Queen of Nii/lit in "The Magic Flute," Donna Elvira In ' "Don Giovanni" and, I believe, on a i < few occasions Donna Anna In the same j flr opera. But the rftlo of Elvira, the neglected wife, aho made peculiarly her own. a Tt In usually assigned to one of the sec- foi ond sopranos, or even to a contralto, sic though Mines. Albani, Nordlca, Karnes a and Gadskl have taken It on special oc- en' casions. Nilsson's Elvira was a figure of Jo mucfli distinction and her superb ren- ca dering of the long and difficult air "Mi m? tradi quell' alma Ingrata" lingers In the wt memory as an example of great singing fry never quite equalled by the best of her thl successors. In London in 1S69 she sang ' 1hls rf>la to tne Anna or ine tarnous or! dramntle soprano Tietjens and the 7,er- au linn of Adellna Pattl. What a. cast1 foi Finally.

But if music eis giv? due consideration to the tes of the presiding officer, Harold uer, they are likely to suspect him exercising a potent influence over the king of tBe lists. In last evening's icert given in Aeolian Hall Sehunn's piano quintet and the Brahms ntet for clarinet and strings were the ge numbers and Mr. Bauer lias long ?n known as an apostle of both com icrs. L'hc Schumann quintet makes its apiranee not infrequently In the cliam music entertainments of this town, t the Brahms clarinet qu'ntet had n permitted to rest in silence since it s given on November 11, 1913, at a icert of the Kneisel Quartet. On that :asion the clarinet player was Henri an Be Roy, then first clarinetist of : Philharmonic Society. Bast evening i clarinetist was George Grises. .Vithout doubt the programme maker J in mind ihe artistic relation 'hesen Schumann and Brahms, a relation ich historians mention spontaneously, which to the casual music lover Is haps not clear. But since both were nanticists, since both composed piano 1 chamber music, as well as aymrnies in the classic forms. Into which , >y poured the fresh feeling of the : er school, one readily accepts the j icrtion that they belonged to the same ritual brotherhood, albeit their 1 thods of expression differed in strik- ; : manners. It has been noted that Brahms wrote clarinet trio and quintet with the ying of Richard Muehlfeld in view. 1 it is also certain that in the second the two works his inspiration reached level of independence which asked no rgestions from the distinguished vir>so's art. The trio paved the way for i quintet. The composer's assimilation the technic and expressive pessibilin of the clarinet made the quintet a iRtion in which the specialisation of Instrument was incidental. It is one the supreme masterpieces in the dertment of chamber music.

'Aren't I?" and "An't 1?" urtit of the Dictionary Shod on an Imported Phrase. To Tub New York Herald: Has the t of consulting the dictionary become lost art that we are asked, "Why seek r authority for the use of the expresin 'Aren't I?' other than the force of more or less general use?" While I tirely agree with your correspondent hnson S. Field when he says "There n bo no authority derived from gramit ical construction." I do not agree th him when he concludes with "or >nt the correct derivation of words in Is Instance." The usage of the most careful speaki nnd writers of an age Is standard thorlty. There Is no such authority the use of the expression "Are IV" or are." "Am TV" Is the only correct rm. "Aren't" Is used for "Are not" leu the subject follows, as "Aren't ii'"' "Aren't tliey?" The best convertional usage contracts the verb when e subject precedes "We're not" . 'ou're not." The recent Importation im England of the phrase "Aren't IV" an erroneous Anglicism for "Am I tV" which Is due to thoughtlessness d arises out of a confusion of the is?s. No educated person says "Arc " or "T are " By consulting the dictionary one irns that "An't TV" Is the correct conictlon for "Am not. IV" and that iron't" Is correct only when used with pronoun of the plural number. Sir nies A. H. Murray cites Southey'.Vat Tyler" (canto ill): "Toil ar'n't to a so easily."
