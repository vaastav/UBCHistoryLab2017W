Terms SI. 00 yciir, ulniiys In ndviuico Senator Edmunds lias introduced his postal telegraph bill, ami intends, ns it is understood, to press it to a vote during tbe present session. An organized effort is being made by the army of fourth-class postmasters to secure an increase in their compensation Bills for that purpose are to be urged in both houses of Congress, and as a preliml nary move petitions for more pay are be ing sent to Congress from all over the country. It is reasserted that Eugene Higgins is to retire from his place as appointment clerk at Washington, to take a better pay ing place in a bucket Bhop, or something else, in Baltimore. This, it is to be under stood, is a purely voluntary retirement on the part of Higgins. Mr. Cleveland would not disturb him till doomsday. Senator Karwell's scheme for the issue of national bank circulation based upon railroad and municipal bonds is not likely to meet with general approval. While the bonds issued by some corporations are no doubt as good as those issued by the government others are of altogether too unsafe a chf.racter for a foundation of this sort. It is said that another nttempt will be made in Congress this winter to put through an amendment to the constitu tion changing inaugural day from the 4th of March to the last Tuesday of April. Should the effort be successful the president-elect will be Inaugurated on the auth in 1SS9, the centennial of Washington's inauguration.

DOLLAR a year. The reply of the wool growers to the president's free trade sophistries is an effective one. Against his theories they set hard facts. Mr. Cleveland, in effect asks Congress to destroy the great wool interest and industry of this country, and to add other thriving industries to tbe ruin. We Bhall see how far the demo cratic House dare go in this direction. Mr. Edmunds declined to be interview ed on the subject of the president's mes sage further than to say that it would be likely to please the English. That it does please the English is quite plain from the comments of the English papers, cabled across the ocean. They accept the mess sage as an earnesc that the United States is about to adopt free trade, and do not pretend to conceal their gratification at the prospect. M. Jules Ferry, the French politician, seems to have had a very "close call." Three of the shots fned at him by the young crank who took this method of forming ''an intelligent and patriotic min istry" struck him, and one of them grazed his temple. Aubertinu is but 20 years old, and seems to be a sort of young French Guitenu, though he did not select the head of the natiou for his game. A Cincluuati court is at present en gaged in trying the case of Samuel C. Young, who wishes to be relieved of the liabilities following a mock wedding, which took place in a balloon, it having transpired that the make-believe parson who married the cuuplo was an actual justice of the peace. Every little while we hear of such a case as this. A mock marriage is a travesty of what in all cases ought to be a solemn rite and it might be a good plan to make it punishable as a mis demeanor. People who are in the habit of sleeping in a room which contains a kerosene lamp turned half down, and the practice is followed by a good many during the winter, si mild heed the words of the New York l)o,. rd of health. In the opinion of this body lamps in this condition in a close and uuventilated bedroom will pro duce an atmosphere that is almost deadly. The best plan is to do away witii the limp in the sleeping room, but if the lamp is a necessity let it burn with a f u'l flame. The annual report of the secretary of war c itH'iin" b it little of public interest. Mr. Kiidh - ys that of the Hi rllle guns that m r u ,v to bo found at various points aloiiu our 3000 miles of sea coast and our 25UU miles of frontier, lbi are of obsolete pattern, ami ef the remaining twenty-six there are only a lew that are mounted In a manner to perform effec tive service.

But they will get no more than they have got before that l iaruon and promises. Mr. Keely is evi dently keeping his motor until It can be utilized in moving ships througti Lie J.es sep's Panama canal. A howl comes up from the Wool Grow ers' association in session in w asningion. This is another case of great cry and little wool. A". 1'. ll'orld. The president's organ, for such it has become, will llnd that no votes w 111 be made for Mr. Cleveland by snubbing the wool growers. They are a remarkably in telligent class of men, and know when they are hit, every time. Two remarkable suicides of young men, both students at Harvard college, oc curred on Sunday. A boy of ID, named Powell, freshman in Harvard college, took poison and turned the gas on in his room, and was found dead. He Is spoken of as a bright, interesting young man, but notably depressed in mind. Ills family lives in New Yolk. In the latter city George Gorham Bond, 24 years old, a member of a well known and wealthy Boston family, committed suicide at the Gilsey House at 3o'clock Sunday morning, blowing his brains out with a pistol. There are stories of an unfortunate love affair in his case ; but his friends attribute the act to hypochondria. He was a stu dent in the Harvard veterinary college, and was quite a favorite among his class mates. Washington letters say that a canvass of the House shows that 165 members tavor unconditionally the repeal ot the internal revenue tax on tobacco, sixty-live favor repeal with some other reductions, forty five are non-committal and only fifty are opposed. It is regarded as settled that the tax of i30,000,000 on tobacco will be abolished as soon as the House can reach it. As a large majority of tbe Senate favor it, it is thought that a bill to abolish the tobacco tax would pass by nearly n two-thirds vote. The difficulty will be to get the bill before the House, as Speaker Carlisle will make up a ways and means commltteo who will endeavor to prevent a bill from reaching the House with out having a tariff bill linked to it. The veterans of the Eighth Vermont regiment will feel the death of Gen. WIS- Ham H. Emory, which took place in Wash ington on the 1st inst. They served uuder him, as commander of the nineteenth corps, in the Shenandoah valley, and he thought much of the regiment and its commander, Gen. Thomas. Gen. Emory was a graduate of West Point in the class of 1831. He was major of the Second cavalry in 1855, and was lieutenant colonel of the First cavalry when the war of the rebellion broke out. He was appointed brigadier-general of volunteers May 17, 1802, and major-general September 15, 1805. He was promoted to colonel of Fifth cavalry October 27, 1803 ; also receiving the brevets for gallant war service of colonel, brigadier-general and major-gen eral, United States army. He was retired with the rank ot brigadier-general July 1, 1S70. Gen. Emory was a noble gentle man, and a soldier possessed of the highest sense of honor and duty and true in eveiy respect to the best standards of his profession. In these days of absconding cashiers and defaulting treasurers perhaps it is not surprising that a good many people should prefer to keep their money in their own hands. But such persons occasion ally find that they are not the safest keep ers. The Maine miser who kept $32,000 in casli in his own house because he had no faith in bank officials, made this discov ery to Ills sorrow. While he slept burg lars came by night and carried away his treasure. A large amount of money is annually lost or destroyed because of the proclivity which some people have to hide it in odd receptacles, uuder the lloor, in a secret recess, in a wall or under sume tree. A destructive fire breaks out or the owner of the money suddenly fall dead of heart disease, leaving no one who knows the hiding place of his money, and the earnings of a lifetime, which would keep his family from want, are lost beyond re covery. The dishonest banker is still the exception, and the man who trusts no one but himself is very likely to sooner or later receive proof of his folly. The democratic and mugwump papers affect to see Mr. Blaine's hand In the se lection of Chicago as the next place for the republican national convention. This is ab surd. There are reasons enough for going o Chicago in its convenient location, im mense accommodations, experience in taking care of crowds aud in the enter prise and hospitality of its citizens, with out seeking for others. If we look for political considerations that might affect the choice, it will occur to mauy that Chicago is the home of Robert hlncoln ; that Senator Farwcll of Illinois, whose home is also there, is openly opposed to Mr. Blaine's caudldacy ; Mind that the Chicago Tribune is tinctured with free trade, and lias openly declared that the republican party cannot win on the issue of protection, with Mr, Blaine as a lead er. If Mr. Blaine's friends were looking for a city .where his personal! following was strongest, they would have gone to Portland, Me. We wonder that Mr. Maine's bitter opponents who are also tho opponents of tho republican party, do not see that they are doing more than any others to secure his renoniinatiou. They Hie doing what they can to conwncethe people that the democratic party has more to fear from Mr. Hlalne's candld.icy than from thai of any other man. If they suc ceed in tills the nomination of Mr. Blaine will follow as a matter of course. Tho AVoolcly Froo Press from this date is reduced one hall it is now only ON 13

He took It llrst on the -1th of March, Will, when he held the olllcu by the appointment of Gov. Dilling ham. He took it next on the -1th ot March, 1M!7. having been elected by tho Legislature to fill out the unexpired tei m of Senator Foot. He took it again after eacli of his four successive elections to the full term. Hy the way, tho remark printed in the New York Tribune, the other day that Mr. Edmunds was not a United .States senator because he had not been sworn in since Ills last election, was not quite correct. A man begins to be a United States senator from the day of the ,,,,,, ,.,,w.ni nf bis term aud is en titled to draw his pay as such.

Don M. Dickinson, the new postma ter general, Is a native ot Ontario, N. Y , but a descendant of a Massachusetts family. He lias been for a number of years a leading lawyer, in Detioit; lias been chairman of the Michigan dem ocratic State committee and a member of tho national democratic committee, Ho has been the democratic boss of Michigan, under Mr. Cleveland, and had absolute control of all the federal up pointments in Unit State. He ij about 50 years old, ot a small and spare build, with a nervous manner, his eyes never seem at rest, and raiely look you in the face, side whlskcis and a white necktie give him an air of a rural waiter. But a few moments' conversation with him will convince one that there is no rusticitr about him. He is activo, shrewd and energetic, nnd will run the postmaster general's department with absolute and unscrupulous reference to teeming ttie permanent domination of the democratic party. The republican Call. The republican national committee are first in the field with their call. The re publican party being a party of positive principles, and in the habit ot shaping its own course, does not need to wait to see the programme of its opponents before announcing its own. The call is a broad one. The man, whatever ills past affilia tions or action may have been, who now believes in protection of American indus try aud In a reduction of the surplus and of taxation from the stand-point of protec tion ; who is in favor of a free and fair ballot and an honest count In every State ; of coast defences which shall enable us to conduct negotiations with other na tions with due national self-respect; of a foreign policy which shall extend our commerce with other nations ; of free schools and the universal education which is the main hope for the elevation ot the negro and for the fitting of the immigrant for citizenship, as well as the mainstay of our free institutions; is to join the party aud participate with the republican voters in the formation of the national republi can ticket. The committee might well, we think, have included a specific invitation to those in favor of an honest aud genuine reform of the civil service; but as the republican party is emphatically the party of civil ser vice reform, aud it has become plain to the dullest intelligence that all the reform that the democratic party wants or will tolerate is one which will "reform" re publicans out of office and replace them with democrats no matter how ignorant or unfit and as it is reasonably certain that the next republican national plat form, like those before them, will include a square declaration on tins point, tne omission need not exclude any voter who agrees to the principles expressed in the call. The convention is called a little later than has been customary. The conven tion of 1872 met at Philadelphia June 5th ; Unit of '70, at Cincinnati, June Hth ; that of '80, at Chicago, June 2i ; that of '84, at Chicago, June 3d. The call is the first formal republican response to .Mr. Cleveland s challenge to make protection or free trade the main issue of the coining canvass. On that issue, as on the other principles enunci ated, the great mass of voters in Vermont hold no uncertain position, and they will speak upon it when the time comes with their old emphasis. One Dollar a year for the Weekly Free J'retsn. The Silvor Dollar. There has been a considerable inereaso ot the number ot standard silver dollais in circulation during the past year. The silver certificates in circulation on No vember 1 were jlC0,713,'.i57, as against jss, 116,225 the yearbetore. This is an in crease ot .s72,5!7,532. There is an Increase also in tho amount of silver in the vaults of the treasury, hut, after deducting the silver coin held lor tho certificates m cir culation, tho government has in its vaults 39,075,700 less btaudard silver dollars than it owned July 1, 1SS0, and this, not withstanding the fact that 43,3S0,S71 standard bilver dollars were coined during that period. Secretary Falrchild's re commendation Unit future purchases of silver by the treasury, under tho act of 1S78, shall not be actually coined Into dol lars, but laid away in the form of bars is a very sensible one. Silver men ought not to object t It because the government would buy just as much metal as now, and tills method would diminish tho ex pense to the country or tho mauufacturo and storage ot the dollars. Mr. Fair child supports his recommendation with the statement Unit there tire more than 200,000,000 of tho cartwheel dollars now lying in tho treasury vaults as security for certificates to the amouutot only f 150,000, 000, There can certainly be no need of any more coinage of dollars until tlio issue of certificates reachos tho amount of tho dollars in tho treasury. Few who have given any consideration to the subject outside of the men who have silver to sell will deny that under the present Jaw tills coinage of 2,000,000 worth ot silver every month is likely In time to make tho silver dollar so plentiful that It will bo at a discount. Congress, however, moves slowly in tills matter and the presont per nicious law is not likely to he repealed until the silver dollar la actually discred ited by the people.

Professor Sumner ot Ynle, wlio Is tho great apostle of free trade, Is, of course, delighted with President Cleveland's mes sage. It will be no easy matter for the revenue reformers to pull the wool over the eyes of the sheep misers, and in this connection it should be noted that Texas, of the "solid south," has become one of the heaviest wool producing States in the Union. Robert T. Lincoln says that Cleveland's tree trade theories, if put in practice, would ruin the manufacturing Interests of tills country in a year. In case General Banks of Massachusetts is not reappointed as United Stntes mar shal, it is said his friends will run him for Congress next fall. Senator Palmer ot Michigan says that "whenever the republican party has been radical it has triumphed." It will Imvn an excellent opportunity to be radically right on the tariff question in 1S88. Reducing tho (Pity In 1S83 on six articles of wool, woollens and worsteds stimulated imports, and three years increased the revenue ill, 405,503 27, and yet the free traders want to reduce duties to decrease the surplus. Mr. Terence V. Powderly thinks that Mr. Henry George is an impracticable doctrinaire, nnd Mr. Henry George thinks that Mr. Terence V. Powderly has no ade qitate uuderstHiidlug of tho industrial problem. The general public will cor dially agree with both. Providence Jour nU. A republican Senate still stands between the British manufacturers and that abso lute joy which they anticipated when they read ttie president's message. The Mew York llcruld prints interviews with manufacturers of various commodi ties in all parts of the country, giving their views on the president's message. The opinions are almost unanimously op posed to the president's free trade recom mendations. The sultan of Turkey has conferred the decoration ot Commander of the Medjidle on I)r Morris II. Henry of New York for distinguished contiibutions to medical and surgical science, some of which are of especial service in the Ottoman Empire. The New York Sun, converted to Cleve land by his famous letter in favor ot Col. Fellows, finds it hard to swallow his mes sage, and says "tho most striking and in teresting part of the message is devoted to precisely that sort of an argument with which any tree trade representative in Congress, or any free trade professor In a college class room, or the author of any free trade text book of political economy, would begin au attack upon the theory of protection." The manufacturers and workingmen who voted for Mr. Cleveland in ISSt. cred iting Mr. Smith Weed's assertion that the candidate was a sound protectionist, and those who in the same belief declined to help Mr. Blaine's election, at a time when a trifling effort by them would have made it certain, can compare the two candidates for themselves.

Miss Eviirts is nnxious to retire from active social life, but her father will not permit her to go into seclusion. He takes great interest in her toilets, and complains that she does not purcbaso enough evening dresses to please him. Mr. Proctor, the manager of the Singer Sewing Machine company, says he pays workmen in Scotland $7 a week for ex aetly the same grade of work that he pays his men here $21 per week for. There is a whole campaign speech in this single fact, which proves the value of the American tariff to American workmen. When Mr. Daniel, the new democratic senator from Virginia, was sworn in he was escorted to the bar of the Senate by Mr. Vance ot North Carolina. This created considerable comment, for it is an unwritten law of the Senate that on such occasions the new member is invariably accompanied by the senator from his own State.
