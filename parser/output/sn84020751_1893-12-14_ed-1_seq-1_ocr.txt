But why it must, we can not know. Hays, Ky. Lula Edwards Cole. THE CALAMITY HOWLERS- As the Philadelphia Times says, while it may suit the purposes of partisans to keep up the calamity howl, the manufacturers who are threating to close thur mills in an ticipation of the Wilson tariff will get tired of the same just as soon as the condition of their own business makes it more profitable for them to go to work. A business man will do a great deal for politics, but he will not sacrifice his nr.siness. Thissoitof childish threat has been tried too often not to be under stood. A firm in Troy, New York, employing six hundred hands in making cotton goods, decided to shut down the day following the publi cation of the Wilson bi'l. They gave as a reason that it vva3 impossi ble to continue with such a menace to their business and they preferred to wait until Congress decided whether protection should allow a resumption or whether the stop should be permanent. Strangely enough, two other cote ton mills, oue in Troy and one at Fall River, employing together 1,300 hands, started their looms and shuttles the same dap the Troy Mills shut down for effect. But the tariff really had nothing to do with either case. The Troy con cern had an accumulation of stock oa banc'; the Fall iliver Mills were sold out aud started up to meet the actual demands of the market. That was the whole? story. Why should carpet weavers, for example, worry about the Wilson bili ? It will make their wool cheaper, tueir dye-stuffs cheaper, aud give them more protection than that had before the McKiuley act, when they were more flourishing that they are no. The Wilson bill can ouly help them. They may be disposed to wait for its passage in order to get its advantages, but they must not expect anybody to be ieve that they are waiting for fear of it. Whatever delay there may be in the resumption of industry will be due to a recognition that under, the new tariff most manufacturers can be carried on more advantageously than now. Even this will not pre veut resumption when there is an existing demand for the goods, and sinca the tariff revision on the lines of the Wilson bill is practically as sured, every manufacturer can make his calculations accordingly. This will be belter occupation than whimpering over imaginary ills, Pikeville Letter. Pikeville, Dec. 4th 1893. Dear Argus; Rev. J. T.

C. 2 l. 1 .il! v E3E0SS THAT ECHO- Chunks of Consolation from the Presi dent's Message. President Cleveland's message fur nishes the slogan for this congres sional session, and ii; is "tariff re form." In these hard times, the President's earnest advice to Congress to be esonom cal is far from perfunctory, It is good advice and it ought to be heeded. President Cleveland's strong state ment of the tariff question in his bast message, sounds somithing like the clarion tones of tie famous tariff reform message with which he sfarthd the country in 1887. The people who were disappointed by Mr. Cleveland's nomination and disappointed by his election were disappointed by his last message, as a matter of course. This is one evi deuce that it is a safe and sound docs ument. Th.? soreheads are hard to please. They complain in one breath that President Cleveland is too dictator ial, aud in the next they grumble be cause he didn't dictate enough in his last message. The masses of the party and of the people, however, nre satisfied both with the President and his message. The President urgis a thorough purging or the pension lists. He alludes to the fact that many pen sion frauds have already beeu den tcteJ and exposed and decltuvs that the good work must be continu.-d. Like all his public utterances this message is strong aud bold. It shows that the President has clear convictions of duty and is both hon est ?,nd fearless in his efforts to carry them out. The Pres:dent advises Congress in con.-idering financial legislation to '"turn away from all alluring and temporary expedients, determined to bG content with nothing less than a lasti .g and comprehensive financial plan." He believes that in due time the efi'rct of the repeal of the Sherman law will be to re store business confidence and to call forth into active ue the great vol ume of money which was "fright ened into hoarding places" by the operation of that law. The President's counsel that financial leg:s'ation should not be rashly undertaken, is sound, but it was very generally expected that he won'd advite the repeal of the ten per cent, tax on state bank cir culatioit. That he did not do so does not convince us that he is op posed to the repeal of this tux. The Democratic platform distinctly and untquiyocally demands that this tax be abolished and we trust con grens will repeal it at an early day. President Cleveland, we are sure, wou'd not withhold his sign ture from such an act, and under proper lestrietions it would b3 the means of great financial re-lie'.

There is a class of women one meets with every day whose dress ing ie above reproach. They go out to walk, not to show their clothes bat to add to their fine stock of health. They look as if they could sit a horse well, and as if they used often the luxury tf a bath. They wear thicksoled shoes with low, broad heels, shapely and well fitting. Their walking and church suits are of cloth, plainly made but of equisite fit. Their gloves and bonnet strings are above reproach. The hair, well cared for, is prettily waved or curled above the forehead, and worn low, to show the shape of the head a style that arthts love.

Women and the Labor Question The femalesuffragista aud various other persons who epell woman with acapi'al initial have recently attacked Mr. Walter Besant, who says in answer; 'I have maintained, and shall continue to maintain, that for wu men to take men's work from them is the most disastrous thinj that can pessibly happen, especially in a small country. For it ha'ves the wages, and lowers the position of the worker.5, and it drives the men out of the country, or forces them to compete with women at lower pay; it deprives men of their wives, and women of their husbands. That is my contention. I eay that when a cry of rejoing is raised becauee another field of man's labor is in vaded by women, we ought to eit down and weep for the lowering ol labor's independence and the loss of men. "As for the theory that the vote would enp.ble women to combine men, remember, combined long be fore they had a vote; that they ought to have a vote because they out number the men it is no rea son at all. The separation of in. terests as that women must re present women; that every trade t-hould have its representatives, and so forth is destructive ot the very foundation on which stands the theorj- of representatives. But how c.mid women legislate for women? By acts to regulate the hours of labot? They exist already, and they are generally a dead letter because when a dcz n dre:smakera have been made to work tor foursand twenty hours on end, the magis trate fines the employer twopence instead of sending him to prison for a month. Such a law is a mock ery. One cannot do a sillier thing than to make a law which cannot be enforced. But it is the constant cry of the veaker brethren to make laws to make more laws as if the existence of a law was any protec tion at aH; as if by the making of laws one could ch?.nge the eelfi-bn ness aad greed of mankind; as if the pissing ot a law without com manding the support of public opinion could do the least good Suppose, however, that, leaving the 6tatntebook alone, we were all to endeavor men and women to gether, without worrying about votes to educate the world and to create public opinion in favor of humane employment, just wages, and consideration for all who work, whether men or women. "The physical force argument underlies everything. Science can never put woman on the same level with man for phyical strength and for fijhting.
