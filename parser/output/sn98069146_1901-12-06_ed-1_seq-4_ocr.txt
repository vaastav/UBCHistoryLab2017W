ENTERED AT BATTLf BORO POST QEHCE A3 9PCOHP CLASS MAIL TiTilindlumountij Reformer BEATTLEBORO, VT FRIDAY, DEC. 6, 1901. THE MESSAGE. President Koosevelt is always a virile and interesting fellow, and though in one of the longest messages with which the country has ever been af flicted we find his characteristic stren uosit) somewhat sobered by a sense of responsibility, and eprigams sub stituted to a largo extent for definite recommendations, it is still an unus ually readable document, in parts most admirable in tone, and in purely lit erary quality unequalled by presiden tial productions, save perhaps Lin coln's, John Quincy Adams' and Jef ferson's. It is only what the Reformer read ers expected that his much-heralded fulmination against the trusts should prove a rlash-in-the-pnn. Roosevelt does not lack pluck, but he is also too much of a politician to pro: ose party suicide by any real attack on trusts. So after writing brilliantly about their evils and at the same time about the great service the "captain's of industry" are doing the country, lie sees nothing to recommend for the pres ent but publicity, enforced by federal law, regarding their organization and operations. It is a curious if not wil ful blindness that sees no responsi biltv in the tariif or any other govern mental' action for the existence of i trflsts, when the truth is that it is i there exactly that all that is evil in j them, their monopoly power, gets its , footing, and there precisely that the , dividing line is to be found for that j care and deliberation he invokes not to strike at legitimate enterprise and progress while fighting what in now law-guarded extortion. And it is one of those half-truths as evil in effect as lies when he points to trusts in other countries as proof of his posi tion. It is hard to believe that a man of his intelligence does not know that trusts in the sense of monopolizing production or unjustly controlling prices, or as anything more than large firms or companies, are everywhere the product of tariffs or governmental favor, and their evil power everywhere exactly measured by the extent of their "protection. " Of course, arguing this way, he ob jects to any revision of tho tariff, echoing the old Carey argument, as often disproved as seemingly supported by dates, that such revisions cause business panic. Of course also he is decidedly un-Rooseveltian in the gin gerly way he handles reciprocity, which he wants to be only the "hand maiden of tirotection." He omits to sav what The news from the Columbian revo lution is rather exciting this week. The chief issue underlying it all, as the Reformer has so often pointed out with regard to South American troubles, is that of union of church and state. It is as a matter of course that pro fuse charges come of fraud in the late election in Alabama ratifying tho con stitutional amendment disfranchising the negroes. Ex-Gov. Johnston of that state formulates them in a way that admits of neither denial nor doubt. Most of the counties where the whites are a majority went against the amendment, but in those in which the negroes are a majority by 13,877 the mathematicians figured out a majority of 21,199 for the amend ment, or in effect that 35,538 negroes voted to disfranchise themselves. Quite naturally these majorities were announced before the election. Though no official forecast or even a hint of it can be obtained, Washing ton opinion is now pretty well set tled that tho verdict of the late Court of Inquiry is to be a complete vindi cation of Schley, or tit least that Dewey and Ramsey can be depended on for such a judgment. Tho reason for this opinion is of course that as A 

LONG, BEAUTIFUL LIFE. Peacefully Closed-Elizabeth Gladden Esta brook the Last of a Leading Family Gone. The next to the oldest resident ami the last representative hero of a lead ing family of the last century, passes from among us in tho death, from old age, of iUrs.

The fun eral was held Wednesday from tho house, Rev. E. Q. S. Osgood olliciat ing, with burial in Prospect Hill cem etery, Mrs. Esterbrook, tin) daughter of Rovnll and Martha (Roberts) Glad den, was born May 19, 18(10, on what was tlien known as the Gladden farm on the linnnyvalo road, but from which the buildings are now all gone, as are all of that name in town, she being the hist of seven children of her family. She wedded Daniel b. Ester brook in 1S32 and they lived in West Ilrattleboro until 1S49, when they moved to this village where he died in lSOil. Their only son, the late O. I).

Harrows and Miss Edith Esterhook, and two great grandchildren, Elizabeth and Oscar Marshall. Their father and her grandson, the late Cashier O. A. Marshall, died in 1HM. Mrs. Ester brook was for many years a member of the Unitarian church, and of a rare sunniness and cheeriness of disposi tion that made the most of good in life, kept her heart ever young, and her interest warm in young people and in current affairs, and her health re markably good until her last illness. She filled indeed beautifully the beau tiful place of "grandmother." men come to think over the matter!
