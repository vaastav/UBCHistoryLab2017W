The Starkville News PUBLISHED WEEKLY. fITARKVILLE. : : MISSISSIPPI. I Demoralizing Sport. The game of football has become se riously injurious to rational academic life in American schools and colleges, says President Eliot, of Harvard, in Suc cess Magazine. Some of the lesser ob jections to the game are its extreme publicity, the large proportion of in juries among the players, the absorp tion of the undergraduate mind in the subject for two months, and the dispro portionate exaltation of the football hero in the college world. The carry ing into elaborate and highly artificial practice the enfeebling theory that no team can do its beat except in the pres ence of hosts of applauding friends is still another of the lesser evils of foot ball. Worse preparation for the real struggles and contests of life can hard ly be imagined. The orator, advocate, preacher, surgeon, engineer, banker, tradesman, craftsman, admiral, general, or statesman who cannot do his best ex cept in the presence of a sympathetic crowd is distinctly a second-class man. None of these things, however, enten into the main objection to the game, for the main objection lies against its moral quality. As developed in this country under fierce intercollegiate competi tion. it has become a game in which the actions of the individual players can often be entirely concealed, not only from the mass of spectators on the benches, but from nearer observers on the side lines, and even from the um pire, who gets as near as possible to the combatants. The game is played under established and recognized rules, but the uniform enforcement of these rules is impossible, and violations of the rules are in many respects highly profit able toward victory. These rules ol action are all justifiable, and even nec essary, in the consummate savagery called war. in which the immediate ob ject is to kill and disable as many ol the enemy as possible. To surprise, am buscade and deceive the enemy and in variably to overwhelm a smaller force by a greater one are the expected meth ods of war. But there is no justifica tion for such methods in a manly game or sport between friends. They are es sentially' ungenerous; and no sport is wholesome in which ungenerous and mean acts, which easily escape detec tion. contribute to victory, whether such acts be occasional and incidental, or habitual. National Prosperity. The horn of plenty Is overflowing in Uncle Sam’s country, and this year’s phenomenal harvests, which will yield a much larger money return than any other in his history, promise the firm foundation for a national pros perity such as the world never has seen. Railroad lines face a congestion of cars and clogging of terminals, rail makers and car builders are crowded with orders, ocean freights are in de mand, manufacturers are running night and day, arable lands have ad vanced from 25 to 100 per cent, in value, more building is being done than ever before, labor is fully employed at high wages; to Japan and Korea enlarged exportations will flow. These nations contemplate spending some thing like $30,000,000 for railway ma terials and equipment, of which a large part will be allotted to the Unit ed States. Japan has already pur chased in this country within the last six months over 200 locomotives, 5,000 railway cars, 400 iron and steel bridges, and much electrical machin ery. It is said that the nation has never held a more advantageous posi tion agriculturally, commercially, financially and politically than In 1905. Public Health Science. There are Interesting and suggestive symptoms of a wholesome reaction against the evils of the sedentary life. Parks and open spaces are being lib erally provided; public and private gymnasiums are rapidly coming into being; public playgrounds are thrown open in many of our cities, free of expense to the laboring, but, never theless, often sedentary, population; vacations are more than ever the fash ion; sports and games are everywhere receiving increasing attention; while public baths and other devices for the promotion of personal hygiene are xnore coming into being. All this is as It should be, but all Is as yet only a beginning. Here the science of edu cation is sadly at fault, and in the direction of educational reform as re gards personal hygiene lies immense opportunity for a contribution to pub lic health science. THE

MISSISSIPPI MATTERS| The State Indebted to Uncle Sarr, The great State of Mississippi is in debted to the national government in the sum of $60,000. The debt is of long standing and represents lost and wornout supplies issued over a period of twenty or thirty years to the Missis sippi national guard. To adjust the claim in some way and to keep the records committed to his care as adjutant-general of the State, Gen. Arthur Fridge of Jaekson is in Washington to coaler with the war de partment on the subject. It seems that for a number of years it has been customarv with former adjutant-generals of Mississippi in making their aunual reports to the war department to report military sup plies without first taking an invoice to ascertain exactly what property fur nished by the government was on hand. Adjutant-General Fridge, however, de parted from the beaten path of his pre decessors by making a sort of merchants’ invoice, and the result discloses the rather startling fact that the State of Mississippi is in debt to Uncle Sam in the neighborhood of $50,000. Under the luw the government can collect this sum, but whether the war department will enforce the statute or not is the question Adjutant-General Fridge would like to find out. One way to collect the debt would be for the government to hold the annual appropriation of $20,000 which Missis sippi receives for the national guard un der a provision of the Dick bill. But will this recourse be either necessary or advisable? -G<*ii. Fridge is desirous of having the matter cleared up. Bfiissiasippi Weather. The following data, covering a period of seventeen years, have been compiled from the weather bureau records at fifty-five observation stations in Missis sippi. They are issued to show the con ditions that have prevailed in the State, during December, for the above period of years, but must not be construed as a forecast of the weather conditions for the present month: Mean or normal temperature, 48. The warmest month was that of 1889, with an average of BQ. The coldest month was that of 1903, with an average of 43. Some of the highest teraperatebes re corded were as follows: 83 at Port Gibson in 1892 and 85 at Crystal Springs in 1904. Some of the. low'esl temperatures re corded were as follows: Zero at Ripley and Holly Springs in 1901. Average rain for the month 4.81 inches. Average number of days with 0.01 inch or more 6. The greatest average monthly pre cipitation was 8.54 inches in 1897. The least average monthly precipita tion was 0.94 inch in 1889. Some of the greatest monthly amounts of precipitation recorded were as fol lows: 14.78 inches at Edwards in 1897 and 13.70 inches at Ripley in 1904. Some of the least monthly amounts of precipitation recorded were as follows: 0.30 inch at Batesville in 1889 and 0,29 inch at Greenville and 0.31 inch at Water Valley in 1898. The average snowfall ranges from about two Inches In the extreme north ern counties to a trace in the gulf counties. In December, 1894, snow fell to a depth of 0 inches in Clay county. Average number of clear days, 13; partly cloudy days, 5, and cloudy days, 13. The prevailing winds have been from the north. Should Encourage Cattle Raising. Two years ago the State of Mississippi changed its system of buying fresh meat for the Mississippi Hospital for the In sane at Jackson, and since that time there has been considerable “kicking” on the part of farmers, butchers, hide-buy ers and others interested in the old plan. The fact that the insane hospital pur chased about 1,000 head of cattle per year gave quite an impetus to the cat tle-raising and the cattle-feeding indus try in the vicinity of Jackson, and made business for a considerable number of the citizens of the State. Now’, how ever, the insane hospital is feeding more than 1,000 patients on beef that is pur chased from a Chicago packer, who is considered one of the chief spirits in the “beef trust.” The amount of fresh meat purchased per day from the Chicago concern is said to be 550 pounds. That means 200,750 pounds for one year, and which, at $5.40 per pound, amounts to $10,840.50. The price of native cattle on foot is 2 1-2 cents per pound, so that a steer weighing 1,000 pounds would cost the State $25. The value of the hide, tal low", etc., is placed at $7.40, so that the cost of a 1,000-pound steer would be only $17.60 net. The 1,000-pound steer will dress, net meat, 450 pounds, making the average cost per pound, 3.90. 200.750 pounds of Chicago meat at 5.40 means $10,840.50 200.750 pounds of Mississippi meat at 3.90 is 7,829.25 The exeess of cost of the Chicago meat over the native meat in one year is, therefore, in the neighborhood of $3,011.25, at present prices of 5.40 for the foreign trust meat. Last year the State paid 6.50 for its Chicago meat. It is argued, on the other hand, that the hospital gets out of and avoids a great deal of trouble and worry by pur chasing the meat already dressed, and also that it gets better meat. That is perhaps true, but the cattle industry in the vicinity of Jackson, and for fifty miles around about, is not flourishing as it did when the hospital purchased the cattle on foot and did its own slaughtering.

GOOD WATCH-DOG. He Barked a Whole. Lot and Kept the Sheep Within the Fold. During the late Rev. Klijah Kellogg's pastorate in Maine he was persistently opposed by the citizens, of no religious convictions, who took malicious satisfac tion in discovering and publishing in consistencies in the lives of the mem bers of Mr. Kellogg’s church. For rea sons ol his own, which the Boston iter ate! does not give in printing the story, the citizen decided to remove to another part of the state. Meeting Dr. Kellogg one day, ahortlj before his departure, he said: ‘’Well, I suppose you nave heard that 1 am going to leave town, and I dare eay yon will beg) id of it."' “Glad of it? Why, no,’’ replied Mr. Kellogg. “I shall he very sorry to lose you. You are so useful to me in my work I hardly know how 1 can spare you.” “Spare me?” repeated the citizen, greaily puzzled. “How is that?” “Why,” said the old minister, witht a gentle smile, “every time a sheep gets ita loot out of my fold you hark from one end* of the town to the other. Yoa are the best watch dog 1 ever knew.” Mr. W. C. Schutz, Vice President and General Manager of the F. R. Rice Mer cantile Cigar Cos., of St. Louis, has re turned with his family from an extended trip to Europe, and finds a decided in crease in the sale of the Commercial Cigar, which, because of its uniform ex cellence, has taken first rank as a choice Havana Cigar. It is handled by all prominent dealers throughout the I. nited States, and the business of the F. R. Rice Mercantile Cigar Cos. now amounts to hun dreds of thousands of dollars annually.
