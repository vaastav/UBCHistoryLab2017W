We don't think he did it, be cause is he kept too busy writing checks. * ■ * The esteemed Washington Post asks, "What Will Congress Do?" We confess our inability to answer, but it would not surprise us to see Congress do a great many things that it ought not to do and leave undone many things that it should do. Sec. We had about concluded that as Nash will be governor of Ohio it was an unnecessary waste of time to tam per with tbe figures of the election re sult in that State in an endeavor to console ourselves with his being in the minority, but since a brainy Republi can like ex Speaker Reed can see de feat for his party in the Ohio election it is time for the Democrats to be hopeful. The busy holiday trade is now on and the business men are wearing happy smiles. When the season closes it would not be out of place to put on foot numerous plans for the purpose of creating a greater trade in 1900 than that which prevailed iv 1899. There are several ways to accomplish this and Staunton is full of men with both the money and the brains to bring it about. The game of football played in Rich mond last Thursday by the Uniyer sity of Virginia team and that of Lehigh University resulted in a score of 10 to 0 in favor of the Virginia boys. According to newspaper reports it was the inspiring strains of Dixie played by the Stonewall Band that gave vic tory to the home team. If such be the case then thehonorof victory must be transferred from Charlottesville to Staunton. . I—-* » ■ The Hon. Randolph Gugeenheimer, a native of Lynchburg, but now a lead ing citizen of Greater New York and prominent in financial and political cir cles, is being put forward as the logical candidate for vice president on the Democratic ticket with Wm. J. Bryan. It is said that Mr. Guggenheimer can hold New York in line for the Demo cratic ticket if he is given second place, it matters not who the Repub lican may name. a i# —♦ Congressman James D. Richardson, of Tennessee, was chosen leader of the Democratic forces in Congress by the Democratic congressmen in caucus last Saturday. Mr. Richardson was opposed by Mr. Sulzer, of New York, Mr. De Armond. of Missouri, and Mr. Bankhead. of Alabama, aud the fact that he defeated such eminent gentle men furnishes evidence that he is the right man in the right place. Now, let the Democrats show to the world the kind of material they are made of. Much depends on their acts in the present Congress. ■ — m~ * The Spectator acknowledges the receipt of the biennial report of Su perintendent W. A. Bowles, of the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind, aud the annual report of Dr- Benj. Blackford, superintendent of the Western State Hospital. These re ports are full of interesting informa tion, and among other things the fact is made plain that an additional sum of money is needed to sustain these two valuable institutions. The Legis lature would practice economy by ap propriating a proper amount for the purpose indicated, and not require the unfortunates to be cared for in a style unbecoming the dignity of the State. It must be comforting to the rank and file of the Republican party to see President McKinley giving prefer ence to gold Democrats in his appoint ments to office. During the past month he appointed W. D. Bynum, of Indi anapolie, to a position that pays §7,500 and right on the heels of this Josiah Patterson was landed in a position that pays equally as well, while hun dreds of Republicans, who have ren dered yeoman service to their party, are left out in the cold. Mr. McKin ley ought to remember the fate of his predecessor, who became Kreater than his party and in a like manner entered a disrupting wedge, which played havoc with it. Men who are faithful in little things should be made riders over things greater, but no man should be rewarded who has been unfaithful. By giving gold Democrats positions Mr. McKinley is thus putting his utarnp of approval on bolters and bolt ing and while he may, by these acts, secure the rotes of Bynum and Pat- j tersou in 1900, the chances are that 1 faithful Republicans will desert him.' Then he will learn of his folly, put It will be too late, too late. l . 

DANIEL CANNOT DEFEAT BRYAN The Fredericksburg Free Lance does not take kindly to the Daniel boom for president, since the collapse of its own boom to land Admiral Dewey in the White House. The announce- Rin a Kansas Republican uewspa-1 hat the name of Dtniel was tak- Lansas by storm somewhat alarm ur Fredericksburg contemporary and while not particularly struck with Mr. Bryan the Free Lauce could not believe the report and at once made an investigation. What it was able to learn is best told iv the following let ter from one of the Kansas Senators Barlrir eS8 e(i to the Free Lance. Hear >ur letter of 29th ultimo duly re ceived, inclosing a clipping which states that "fusion leaders in Kansas, from John Breidenthal down, with the exception of J. G. Johnson aud J. Mack Love, privately admit that Col. W. J. Bryan has no show Of election to the Presidency next year." 1 heg to say that I have been nearly all over the State this summer and fall, have met almost all the representative men. both Democrats and Populists, who are in favor of fusion, and that I have never yet beard such an opinion ex pressed. lam absolutely certain that the unanimous desire of all those who wish to see successful co-operation of all the different elements in Kansas opposed to the Republican party is heartily for the renomination of the Hon. W. J. Bryan. We do not believe that any one else has the absolute con fidence of all of these people to such an extent as he has. I know that the feeling in '90 was one of general regret that Senator Daniel was not nominat ed for the second place on the ticket, and there was a strong feeling that II he been given second place that would have won. We iv Kausas ertain the highest regard and es m for Senator Daniel, and would be delighted to have an opportunity to vote for him for Vice-President, but I I absolutely sure that the sentiment he Western country is for Bryan President in 1900. Very truly, W. A. Hakkis. A 

BOLTER HORRIFIED. In closing a long editorial on Rich ard Croker the Norfolk Landmark ex claims: "What is the country coming to when a man like Richard Croker calm ly announces, long before the choice of delegates to the National .Democratic Convention, that no vice presidential candidate'has been selected yet'? It is time for the people of this country to be paying some attention to their own case. Between boss on one side Bboss on the other, what do the pie amount to anyhow? They ought to thrust out their elbows and mr.ke room for themselves." Our contemporary forgets that it was the people and not the political bosses who framed the Chicago plat form and nominated Wm. J. Bryan in 1890. That was a time when the peo pie ruled and the Landmark proceeded with a quick step to the ranks of the trust bosses, political bosses, money Ises and bosses of every other make I kind and there it has remained, want no better evidence of the t that the people made the Chicago form and nominated Mr. Bryau n was manifested in those days by bobsss. many of whom were un pared fpr and embarrassed over the ■ising. The appeal of the Landmark jehalf of the people is disgusting to the least in view of its attitude cc the Democratic party became nocratic. TICKET FOR 1900. 'or President: Wm. Jennings Bryan, on a platform for true Democracy, ) coinage of silver and opposition to sts and imperialism, with a modest vest that Mr. R. L. Cordon shall re g as chairman of the Democratic ty of Louisa. —Louisa News. To those who understand politics the above paragraph sounds ridicu lous. Of course the News is right in tag for Bryan, but in being for him i necessary to have votes to elect i. Last month the Democratic didate iv Louisa had three oppo nents iv addition to the powerful (?) influence of tbe News, but notwith standing, Mr. Gordon, as chairman, led the fight and gave the Democratic nominee 1,000 majority. If a man can do this, with odds against him, he should be called to a higher position and not be called in a "modest" way to resign a position he fills so ably. We'l* wager a treat that State Chairman Ellyson was surprised as well as grati fied at the excellent management of party affairs in old Louisa. Three cheers for Chairman Gordon. The Rockbridge Couuty News is of the opinion that the Republican nomi nation for Congress in this, the Tenth district, will not be much sought after next year. Our contemporary, we fear, is not well posted on Republican politics (though it should be) if it be lieves what it says, as the woods are full of timber of tlrs kind. The friends of Heber Ker, of this city, are already pressing that gentleman's claims, while there are quite a number who would accept it, notwithstanding the rank aud file of the party are in the midst of plenty and prosperity. If the News thinks that prospective positions with $5,000 salary attachments are going a begging it is simply ignorant of human nature. Married in Illinois. Miss Dora Grove, daughter of Air. and Mrs. A. J. Grove, of Danfortb, 111., was married in that, city on the 22ud of last month, to George Brower, of Waynesboro, Va.

STAUNTON SPECTATOR AND VINDICATOR. Synopsis of President's Message. "I urgently recommend that to aup >ort the existing gold standard, and to maintain 'the parity in value of the :o!ns of the two metals (gold acd sil ver) and the equal power of every dol ar at all times in the market and in ;he payment of debts,' the Secretary Rsasury be given additional 1 charged with the duty to d States bonds aud to employ r effective means as may be to these ends." atblied the judgment of the avors the policy of aid to our marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets aud up build our sea carrying cup-nelly for ihe products cf agriculture aud manufac ture, whijb, with the increase of our navy, means inor» work aud wages to oar countrymen, as well as asafeguaid to American interests iv every part of tbe world." Mbiuations of capital organized sts to control the conditions of trace among our citizens, to stifle com petition, limit production, and deter mine the prices of products used and conßurned by the people, are justly provoking public discussion, and should early claim the attention of the Congress. It is universally conceded that combinations which engross or control the market of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary to the general community, by suppressing natural and ordinary competition, whereby prices are un duly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not only to the common law, but also to the public welfare. There must be a remedy for the evils involved in such organizations." "This government has maintained an attitude of neutrality in the unfor tunate contest between Great Britain and the Boer states of Africa. We have remained faithful to the precept of avoiding entangling alliances as to affairs not of our direct concern. Had circumstances suggested that the par ties to the quarrel would have welcom ed any kindly expression of the hope of the Ainericen people that war might be averted, good offices would have baen gladly tendered." "This nation has assumed before the world a grave responsibility for the future good government of Cuba. We have accepted a trust, the fulfillment of which calls for the sternest integrity of purpose and the exercise of the highest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of the past must needs be bound to us by ties of sing ular intimacy and strenglh if its en during welfare is to be assured. Wheth er those ties shall be organic or con ventional, the destinies of Cuba are in I'itf ul form aud mauuer irrevo jked with our own, but how ■ far is lor the futureto.de in the ripeuesss of events, ir be the outcome, we must see t free Cuba be a reality, not | i perfect entity, not a. hasty j at bearing withiu itself the of failure." lain duty is to abolish all cus-| ills between United States and [ co, and give her products free j access to our markets." ■ie future government of the j pines tests with the government! United States. Few graver re bilities have ever been confided to us. If we accept them iv a spirit worthy of our race and our traditions, I a great opportunity comes with them. The islands lie under the shelter of our flag. They are ours by every title o£ law and equity. They cannot be aban doned. If we desert them, we leave them at once to anarchy and finally to barbarism. We fling them, a golden apple of discord, among the rival pow ers, no one of which could permit an other to seize them unquestioned" Their rich plains aud valleys would be the scene of endless strife and blood shed. The advent of Dewey's fleet iv Manila bay, instead of being, as we hope, the dawn of a new day of free dom and progress, will have been the beginning of au era of misery and vio lence worse than any which has dark ened their unhappy past. Until Con gress shall have made known the for mal expression of its will I shall use tbe authority vested in me by the Con stitution and the statutes to uphold the sovereignty of the United States in those distant islands as in all other places where our flag rightfully floats. I shall put at the disposal of the urmy and navy all ineanß which the libarali ty of Congress aud the people have provided to cause this unprovoked and wasteful insurrection to cease." ¥rhen Did the People Decide? The administration will not succeed in getting the people to believe that the provisions of the currency bill em body the verdict of the people express ed at the polls. When did the people vote for the single gold standard ? Where has that question ever been brought face to face with the people in any election? The Republican party in 1890, the last time the people have been called upon to pass upon the qnea tion of National financial measures and policies', declared for bimetallism in stead of the gold standard. They de clared that bimetallism is a commend able thing to have, and pledged them Belves to use all possible means to se cure it. Now instead of giving them I bimetallism, aud without making any ] sincere or earnest effort to secure it, they seek to redeem the pledge they made to the gold monopoly and pat the gold standard in the statutes. They do not stop at this. They then say that this is in accordance'with the voice and wish of the pnople ex pressed at the polls. After they pass the proposed law creating the bank ing trust they will hear a verdict of the ' people at the polls that they will not (soon forget.—Charleston (VV.

Patrick appeared before the council and addressed said body in behalf of the petition of the Staunton Mutual Telephone Co . tor privilege to string wires on electric light poles as heretofore, and in case of refusal to give reasonable time to make necessa- K;es. The matter was referred Attorney Gordon and the ordi ommittee. c being no further business lent to the Grand Jury. J.

The ease was tried before Magistrates W. W. Hamilton, S. A. D. McKee and Wm. Taliaferro. Sev eral witnesses were examined, which consumed the better part of the day, I and at the close of the hearing the magistrates decided to send the accus ed to the grand jury, which meets in February next. In default of $1,000 I bail the prisoner was remanded to jail. j During the progress of the trial At- ' toruey Curry had some warm words with James Rowe, a friend of Mrs. Grim, the injured person, and a wit ness in the case. A personal difficulty was avoided, but there was consider able talk indulged in by these parties a well as others present. * —♦ —• Donald Wins and Gooch Loses At the caucus of the Democratic members of the Legislature held Tues day night Senator Morris, ot Albe marle, was made president of the sen ate caucus, and Senator Barksdale, secretary.
