à DAILY GAZETTE. C. P. Johxmw, Kurroa an PaorBiaron. Xai Daily Oaiitti is published ctoit afternoon, (except Sunday) at 416 Market street, and served by carriers to subscribers in all parts of Wilmington sod the surrounding towns and villages, for six cents a weak, payable weekly. Vearly subscribers The DELAWARE GAZETTE, established >784, the largest and most flourishing weekly in the täte, and has a larger circulation than any other the Peninsular. Published every Friday mom ma at V a year, in advance. The President's Message. Tha refusal of l'rmident Grant to hava hit Message to Congress printed and forwarded to the press of the various large cities, as has heretofore been the custom, delayed the publication uf that, once considered .important document several hours and it was not circulated in 'Wilmington until a late hour. As a consequence, the interest which is usually attached to its reception passed awqy when it was found that it could not be got and perused in the club rooms and social circles during the leisure hours of the evening on which it usually makes its appearance. The Message is long and covers a whole page of some of the city deities; but is devoid of that com pleteness and finish which a fine writer and man ot learning and ability gives to literary work and is dry and irksome. Aside from this tbe fact that the Presidential office is filled by a man who it the mere instrument of a party and incompetent to propose a wise policy and inforce its adoption on Congress by cogent reasons, and arguments be coming a statesman, destroys tbe anxiety that once existed to learn the course of legislation which Presidents Messages once foreshadowed.— This is no longer the case, and those who would learn must wart until the caucus of a political par ty has determined a policy. A synopsis of the Messsge will therefore be as much as our readers will care to wade through, and this we have tried to furnish them in such a manner as will give them a fair idea of the con tents of the document. The Message opens with s reference to the Bos ton fire and remarks that otherwise we have been free from pestilence, war, and calamities which often overtake nations, and, ax tar as human judg ment can penetrate the future, no "cause seems to exist to threaten onr present peace." A reference is then made to the Geneva arbitra tion and the award of 115,500,000 in gold by the government of Great Britian in tbe settlement oi the Alabama Claims. Tbe decision of the Empe ror William by which the United States is left in undisputed possession of Sun Juan is detailed.— The appointment of a "commission to act jointly with one that may be appoiuted on the part of Great Britain to determine the line between our territory of Alaska and the exterminu, possessions of Great Britain." The joint commission for determining the boun dary line between the United States aud British Possessions, between the Lake of the Woods aud the Hucky Mountains, has organized and entered uj-on its work. With France, our earliest all constant and steady fnend of the Germany, with whose Government aud people we have so many causes oi friendship, aud so many common sympathies, and the other powers ot Europe our relations are maintained on the moat friendly terms. To further aid American exhibitors at the Vi euna Exposition, it is recommended in addition to an appropriation of money that the Secretary of the Navy be authorized to" lit up two naval ves sels to transport between our Atlantic cities and Triest or the most convenient ]>ort to Yienua aud bxck their articlea for exhibition. Our relations with Mexico next claims the at tention of the President. He regrets the acts of lawieeiness on the border, and recommends a fur ther appropriation to enable the Commission to continue their investigation of the outrages made upon Americans. He refers to Cuba anil says Deeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is one of the most active causes of the continuance of tbe unhappy condi tion m Cuba, 1 regret to believe that citizens of the United Btates, or those claiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed as property, but which is forbidden and denounced by the laws of the United States. They are thus * in defiance of the spirit ot our own Jaws, con tributing to the continuance ot this distressing and sickening contest. Brax 1 and tbe Argentiae Republic and other States in Central and South America are referred to, but nothing of special note is said. "Uur treaty relations with Japan remain unchanged. " Tbe embassy fiom that country is flattered. Our representetives in Japan and China have to de. psnd upon interprétera who kuow our language imperfectly and therefore it is recommended that "an appropriation be made to support at least f iur American youths in each of these countries to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers there. Uur representatives would not even then he place upon an equality with tbe representation of Great Britain or .f some other piwen." We presume tbe President means that these youths shall be educated in the languages oi Japan or China, but the message does not dis tinctly say so. The Message neat refers to the Treasury, tbe reduction of the public debt and the expenditure, of tbe various departments, and recommends the v ; Russia, the United States; reporta of th. rarioua Secretariat to th. attention of Congnaa. Th. route to connect the Miaaiasippi Valley with the Atlantic Ocean, at Obarleaton, 3. C., and Sarannah, Ua., by water, by the way of th.
