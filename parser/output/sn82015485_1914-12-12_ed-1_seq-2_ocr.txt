WESTERN KAIT3A3 WOSLD PORTUGAL GOES TO THE AID OF GREAT BRITI AN Lisbon Dispatches Say the Army Will Mobilize Soon Treaty of 1703 Calls for this Action. COAST BATTLE HOT Germans Renew Heavy Assaults on Allies Near Channel Russians Win Again in the West of Poland. (Summary of Events. : A brief dispatch from Lisbon says the Portuguese congress has decided that Portugal should co operate with the Allies. The minister of war has called for a partial mobilization of. the army. The treaty by whicli Portugal be lieves it is bound to aid the Allies was made in 1703 with England, and it provides that "each shall mutually aid and help the other" in case of attack. The only neutral countries left in Europe now are Norway, Sweden, Den mark, Holland, Switzerland, Spain, Italy and the Balkan states, exclusive of Servia and Montenegro. Portugal is the tenth nation to enter the xvar. Portuguese troops have already fought side by side with the British in put ting down the Boer revolt in South Africa. The peace footing of the Por tuguese army is about 35,000. A war footing doubles the size. The navy is composed of a dozen second and third rate vessels. Heavy Attack on Allies. The Allies have been attacked in force from Ypres to La Bassee. A terrific battle has commenced. The Germans have heavy reinforcements and fresh guns for this renewal of the effort to cut through the Allies' line. The English artillery, however, thus far has thwarted all the German at tempts. It is now said the plan is to reach the French coast by December 10. The Germans show few signs of being staggered by their enormous losses and dispatches from Berlin set forth that the German troops are far better able to stand, exposure to the cold than are the allies. The forces of Emperor William are trained and clothed for just such an emergency, while the troops of the Allies, from the south of France, from Morocco and from India must necessarily suffer greatly. Cold and Fatigue. The extreme cold weather and the exhaustion -of the troops engaged have vitually brought the battle in Flanders to a standstill. A desultory artillery duel continues at some . points along the wide front- and there has been an occasional in fantry attack, but for the last five days the fighting has been mild com pared with the fierceness of that which for more than a month pre ceded it. Both Sides Rest. The Germans, it is evident, have sent their best troops to the eastern front and even in big guns the allies appear to have the advantage over them. There are no signs, however, of an offensive on a large scale on the part of the allies, who doubtless are as badly in need of rest as their oppo nents. In fact, it is stated that the officers and men who have borne the brunt of the fighting in the trenches are being given a short leave. Losing Guns in Mud. Many heavy guns have been lost by the Germans in the floods in Flan ders. The official French com munique in stating this declares that the artillery fire from the coast to the Lys has slackened somewhat. Sua- GRAND DUKE NICOLAS Commander-in-chief, cf the Russian army In the field... Snow 1s again falling in Flanders and the bad weather prevented any in fantry attacks being made by the Germans. The Germans fo'lowed up their advantage at Chauvancourt in the region of St. Mihiel and have re occupied the village. Freezing in Belgium. Freezing weather has set in through out the length of the battle zone in Belgium, the temperature varying be tween 25 and 28 degrees above zero Fahrenheit. Snow is falling in the Vosges mountains and also at Mar seilles. French Silence German Guns. French forces have captured the heights of Ornes near Verdun and silenced two German batteries, ac cording to official dispatches to the French embassy. Victory for Russians. The Russians have won an import ant battle with the Germans between the Vistula and Warta rivers in Po land. ' Danger of the capture of War saw, capital of the vast territory. Is once more dissipated by this victory. About a week ago the Russians had driven the Austro-German army about 150 miles southwest of Warsaw. Then the Teutonic allies turned on their pursuers. " So sudden and fierce was the at tack that the Russians retreated. They were followed by the Germans who pushed the center of the long Slav fighting line, to a point within fifty miles of Warsaw. There an other battle has been staged this one between the rivers. A Second Battle Probable. The same dispatches that tell of Von Hindenburg's reverses, however, say that the German reinforcements were being brought up so that another great battle is likely to develop on a line nearer to the frontier of Posen, where the Germans will have the same chances of renewing a vigorous offensive as had the Russians in the present instance. General Von Hindenburg has about 400,000 men, but if the Petrograd re port can be accepted, they have been separated, badly cut up and thousands taken prisoner, so these German forces will require reformation and rest. Another Russian army Is operating along the border of East Prussia, and a third one is pursuing a vigorous campaign In northern Austria. It was said by military experts that the purpose of the Austro-German attack and pursuit of the Russian center was to draw off the second and third armies from East Prussia and Galicia. What these lesser Slav forces are do ing has not been revealed. Veil of Secrecy. The veil of secrecy has been drawn over the battles between the Russians and the Austro-German forces. The headquarters of both armies now are confining themselves to the briefest statements concerning the hostilities, saying merely that fighting is in progress. Przemysl About to Fall. A dispatch from Petrograd says that it is announced there that the siege of Przemysl appears to be rapid ly approaching its end. 'The trenches surrounding the fortifications are in the possession of the Russian troops. Many of the trenches are .filled with lime, confirming statements of pris oners that cholera is raging in the gar rison of Przemysl. Russians In Galicia. In Galicia, before Cracow and in East Prussia, the Russians are pushing their advantage, apparently disregarding the fact that their cen ter has been compelled to fall back. They also are showing much activity in the Carpathians, their object being to prevent the Austrians from retiring into Hungary in fact, it is stated that they already have cut off eight hun dred thousand Austrians, who will now be compelled, if defeated, to re treat westward. Turks Are Winning Fast. Official reports given out . in Con stantinople relate the continued suc cessful Turkish advance upon Batum, the Russian port on the Black Sea. All the territory between the Turko Russian border and the River Chursk is in Turkish hands, while a Turkish force in the southern part of this ter ritory has taken Artwin. The Turks declare that the English losses at Shatt-el-Arab amounted to 750 dead and several thousand wounded. Russian Port Bombarded. The Turkish cruiser Hamidieh, fol lowed by a flotilla of torpedo boats, appeared off Tauhse, Russia, and opened fire, hurling 125 projectiles into the neighborhood. The Russian artillery immediately replied with a very effective fire. Turks Reach Suez Canal. An official Turkish statement says that the Turkish troops have reached the Suez Canal. In fighting near El ivantara the English suffered heavy losses and took flight. Turks Far Into Egypt. Turkish troops have occupied Kala tulnahl, seventy-five miles beyond the Egyptian frontier, an official Turkish statement declares. Riot in Constantinople. The British embassy in Constanti nople has been sacked and the Rus sian hospital pillaged and all foreign ers have been more or less seriously abused. May Attack Italy. The Italian government is aware thst Austria Is doing its utmost to induce Turkey to attack Italy, but none the less hesitates to believe the report that has just come In from one of its most reliable agents that com mon action of the combined Austro Turkish squadron Is to be expected against Italy at a very early date. 

RUSSIANS REPORT GERMANS IN ROUT Petrograd Claims Complete Victory Over Teutons and Austrians in Poland. FRENCH GUNS ARE NEAR METZ Artillery Bombarding Arnaville, Only Ten Miles Away Allies Retake Dixmude Another British Battleship Blown Up. Latest Dispatches.) London. Official news received In London declares that the rout of the German and Austrian forces in Po land has been complete. The general staff, however, is not yet able to .give any details of this fighting. t is now clear that the Russian victory in Po land is decisive. The number of pris oners taken by the Russians is esti mated at fifty thousand. Abandon Guns and Transport. The Germans have begun a retreat along the entire front, and in many places the flight is a disorderly rout, marked by the abandonment of artil lery, maxims and transports. Berlin meanwhile is beginning to talk about repulsing Russian attacks, which is a subtle method of announcing that the German troops are on the defensive. Germans in Bad Way. ' One group of the Russian forces tetters the Austro-German army on the Czenstochowa-Cracow front, in flicting heavy blows and capturing guns and prisoners. Apparently an other group of Russians are holding at Wielun a German column which is endeavoring to go to the rescue of the Plock group. The main Russian force is exclu sively engaged against the Plock group, whose front Is cut in halves. Its right half Is surrounded on all sides and is vainly struggling as in an iron vise and striving to break through to the left wing at Lowicz, which in turn is battling unsuccessfully. French Guns Near Metz. French artillery continue to bom bard ArnavJlle, only ten miles from Metz. The development of an offen sive in Lorraine has long been expect ed, but to what extent It may be car ried was not indicated at the war of fice. From north of Verdun and south of. Metz the German line extends in a wedge into the Verdun-Toul defenses of the French. The two sides of the wedge are joined in the region of Chauvoncourt and St. Mihiel, where desperate fighting has occurred the last week. It was at Chauvoncourt that the French suffered heavy losses through the explosion of German mines. The French have been unable to drive the Germans from the posi tions that now hold In this district and the movement upon Arnaville is evidently a tightening of the circle which the French are endeavoring to drive about St. Mihiel; Allies Retake . Dixmude. The correspondent of the Daily Mail at Dunkirk, France, telegraphs that Dixmude has been retaken by the Al lies. He says the French marines at tacked the town strongly Tuesday night and drove the Germans out of three lines of advanced trenches. Wed nesday they followed this up by en tering the town in an irresistible charge. The enemy did not halt in their retreat until they were seven miles out of the town. The marines lost three hundred men. Another British Warship Sinks. The British warship Bulwark was blown up in the Medway .river off Sheerness by an explosion in her ma? azines. Announcement of the disas ter was made by Winston Churchill, first lord of the admiralty, in the House -of Commons. Churchill sail only twelve had been saved out of the crew of 700 or 800 aboard the Bulwark The explosion, he said, was believed to have been in an internal magazine. Russian Troops in Servia. ' a The correspondent at Sofia, Bul garia, reports that Russian troops have arrived in Servia to assist the Servians in fighting the Austrians. Fifteen regiments of Russian troops with seventy barge loads of ammuni tion and supplies have arrived at the Servian town of Raduievatz," the Times correspondent says. "They made the 300-mile trip up the Danube from Russian territory. They will be rushed to the front to assist the Serv ians." Fleeing From- Breslau. Several thousand refugees, mostly members of wealthy German families in Breslau, have arrived in Munich during the last forty-eight hours. They declare that the city is in a state of consternation owing to the reported approach of the Russians and all bus iness is at a standstill. Congress Spent $1,116,118,138. Washington. Nov. 27.

THE WHEAT FIELDS OF WESTERN CANADA AN ATTRACTION THE EUROPEAN WAR MAKES THE GROWING OF WHEAT EX CEPTIONALLY REMU NERATIVE. One result of the European War has been to reduce the volume of busi ness done by many of the manufac turing institutions of the United States, commercial enterprises have been affected, business of many kinds have been hampered, and a financial stringency has been forced on almost every commurflty. It is not only be cause it has brought these things about, and created a lot of hardship, but there is the outstanding fact of the terrible loss of life, the great de struction of property, and the" disrup tion of everything near and dear to those whose countries are involved in the war that makes the whole affair highly regrettable. The heart of the entire world goes out in sympathy to those within the area of the trouble. Arrangements have been made to re lieve the distress by money and other means. But there is one great thing wheat and flour that the European countries will need. The wheat-producing countries are no longer pro ducing, and there is the gravest rea son to fear that they will not be for some years. In this case, it would be fully as beneficial and charitable to make provision to meet the loss of Europe's grain crop by- encouraging a greatly increased growth on this con tinent. The wheat-growing sections of the United States have about reached their limit of production, and this source cannot be depended upon to meet a great deal of the demand that there will be for some years. The only country that is in a position to meet it is Canada that portion known as Western Canada. Here there are millions of acres of land, capable of producing from 20 to 40 bushels per acre. All this land is ex cellent for wheat, and very much is still in the hands of the Dominion Government, and 160 acres of it can be had by the payment of a ten dollar entry fee. Another vast area is that held by railway and reliable land companies, held at from $10 to $25 per acre. Im proved farms are slightly higher in price. Information regarding these lands may be had of any Canadian Government Agent. The fact that Canada offers such a splendid opportunity should be ac cepted with a wide-spread apprecia tion, and not met with attempts on the part of some to spread misleading statements. The Dominion Govern ment has not taken steps to deny many cf the false statements circu lated by these who evidently are more interested in injuring Canada than benefiting those who would be bene fited by taking up farms in Canada, but in order to correct a highly er roneous impression that conscription is carried on in Canada, that compul sory military service is employed, and that there is restraint as to the move ment of those not Canadians, the ne cessity is felt of giving as much pub licity as possible to a denial of these statements. An item to which special exception is taken is one which says: "They are sending them away as rapidly as possible; but the young men are not permitted to leave Can ada. All the citizens, and those who have taken out homesteads are subject to military duty." In direct refutation of this we beg to quote from a recent editorial in the Rochester, N. Y Herald: "There is no legal process by which Great Britain can command a single Canadian soldier to enter the field in her aid or even in her most needful defense. Great Britain cannot legally take a dollar of Canada's money for this or any other war without Can ada's consent. All must be given vol untarily, if it be given at all. Yet men and dollars are given to the limit of Canada's power to give, just as if Great Britain had both physical and legal power to exact them. Indeed, it is possible that they are giving more freely in this way, for what a man gives because he wants to give is likely to be greater than what be gives under force. - "All in all it is a noble picture of devotion to her motherland which Canada offers to the gaze of her ad miring and envious neighbors." Canada's invitation for immigration extends to all who are willing to go cn to the farms. Superintendent of Immigration, Ottawa, Canada. Ad rertisement. Safe Either Way.

"Well, let her," said the farmer. "She'll be a foot higher if she does." Minneapolis Journal. Pluck. Lawson Bjones has been married for a year now, and he still looks happy.

NEED MORE CO-OPERATION Legislative and Executive Branches of Government May Cut Out Yards of Red Tape. Washington, Nov. 24. Two plans de signed to bring the executive and legis lative branches of the government in closer touch are being tentatively con sidered by the President and members cf bis Cabinet and by some of the more important leaders in Congress. One is the personal attendance of the President at executive sessions of the Senate in the consideration of nominations and treaties. The other is the participation by members- of the Cabinet in the proceedings of the House of Representatives. Right to Attend Certain Sessions. The President already has the right to attend legislative sessions f the Senate though no President since George Washington ever availed him self of the privilege. T confer upon the members of the Cabinet the right to participate in Congressional de bates, but without voting power, will require an amendment of the rules. Voting privilege can be granted only by an amendment of the constitution at least that is the opinion of authorities on such subjects. The discussion 'of the two projects has so far been purely informal, pre liminary to the preparation of the an nual message which President Wilson will send to Congress when it con venes two weeks from tomorrow. It is not definitely certain that the Presi dent will make reference or recom mendation concerning them in his of ficial communication. None is neces sary to give him the right to attend legislative sessions of the Senate and it is probable that he would not make known his decision to take a hand in the secret deliberations of the Senate in advance of his determination to do so. Regarding the proposition to have his Cabinet attend the sessions of Con gress to clearly define the attitude of the administration itself toward legis lative undertakings In which the exec utive department was more than or dinarily interested there may or may not be made reference in the annual message of the President. Senate Has Favored Plan. Bills conferring such right on mem bers of the Cabinet have been intro duced in Congress from time to time during the last twenty years. On three occasions bills amending the House rules to accomplish the project have been favorably reported to the Senate. The House itself, which is more di rectly affected, has not taken so kindly to the proposed change, which would provide almost as great an innovation as the decision of the President to read his message in Congress in per son Instead of sending them by mes senger to be read by the clerks of the Senate and the House of Representa tives. The President has generally availed himself of this privilege with few exceptions since he has been in office. 

SOLDIERS LEAVE VERA CRUZ American Troops Withdraw but Five Warships Remain to Guard the Interests of Foreigners. Washington, Nov. 23. Brigadier General Funston's infantry and ma rines, numbering about six thousand men, today hauled down the Stars and Stripes which have been flying over Vera Cruz since last April and evacu ated the Mexican port in accordance with instruction from President Wil son. The five battleships at Vera Cruz and Tampico and the string of vessels on the West coast will remain indefi nitely. They will continue to afford by their presence protection to Ameri cans and be in readiness to meet emer gencies. President Wilson Is hopeful that the evacuation of Vera Cruz will be an en during demonstration to Central and South American countries of the pol icy or the United States enunciated in his Mobile speech a year ago to seek no territorial aggrandizement south of the Rio Grande. The original purpose of the occupation of the port to gain satisfaction for an affront to the flag having been accomplished, he believes continued presence of American troops on Mexican soil would be misinterpre ted through Latin-America. In withdrawing from Mexican soil, the United States government ha3 taken pains that no faction shall be recognized. Kaiser's Son in a Wreck. Copenhagen. Nov. 23.

"Fire!" hoarsely shouted the artil lery captain, and the roar of the guns responded, but without checking the steady advance of the enemy. One piece remained undischarged. "Why don't you fire?" demanded the captain. v- "I I don't know if is loaded," re sponded the gunner. . A gleam of joy lit up the -stern fea- "Then victory is ours!" he shouted.

A young spark, notorious'for his con ceit, was boasting in the presence of several gentlemen about the conquests which he had gained over the female heart. ' "Look," said he, "here's a handsome present I had from my last inamo rata," at the same time handing round a beautiful cigar-case. All admired the article, which had an indorsement of its quality stamped upon it; "Very nice gift," remarked one of the company. ."I perceive your lady love even had your name put on the case." "Well, that's queer," answered the boaster. "I never noticed it." "Look again," rejoined the candid one. - "The case is distinctly marked 'Real calf." " By Wire." Louise Randolph smilingly confirms this tale told of her the other day: She was in her dressing room pre paring to go "on" when the- call boy announced that she was wanted at the telephone. "I can't go now," she replied; ."take the message." The boy returned shortly, slightly embarrassed. "You had better come. Miss Ran dolph," he said. "It's your daughter, and she wants to give you a kiss over the phone.'' Green Book. . Starting the Day Wrong. There was a gloom on the face of the New England farmer.
