Tho house of representatives has voted to close the canteen with tho expecta tion that the senate will vote to open It again. Tho ottlelul canteen In tlio na tional capital that supplies tho senators and representatives Is lu the meanwhile carefully overlooked. Kaug Yu Wei, tho Chinese reformer, writes to tho foreign ministers and points out that affairs In the Flowery Kingdom will never bo truly reformed unless he Is given tho Job.

New York Is experimenting with a few millionaires In Jury service, but n verdict by a Jury composed of million aires will not be any moro conclusive thun ono composed of day laborers, in tills republic every man counts alike at tho ballot box and lu tho Jury room. Tho news which Is gradually filtering out of the Chlneso capital goes to t'how that the action of the foreigners in tlio matter of loot Is ono of the most dis graceful affairs of the century. The latest charge implicates tho lato Hrltlsh minister to China, Such actions are not calculated to advance Christian, civiliza tion In tho Orteut, THE II A HT LEY PAIlDnS. Under this caption the Nebraska In dependent, the otllclal oman of the pop tilists of this shite, makes the specific? charge that ?.';.,000 has been offered t Induce Coventor Poyntor to grant pardon to the Into embezzling state treasurer, .loseph S. Hartley. This charge is coupled with the followln comment, which demands prompt and positive disclaimer Insofar as It con corns The Ueo and Its editor: Those- who have been opposed to Oovcrno I'oyntcr have been lu the habit of bringing tho accusation that ho "was a weak man.' Somo distinguished Kontlcmcu met with a surpriso lately when they ihoufiht to bank on Ills reported weakness. A very larpo sum or money was raised to sccuro Hart ley s pardon. It was largo enough to get an agreement for silence from tho three great dallies of the state Tho Ilee, tho World-Herald and tho Stato Journal bo sides J35.000 to bo paid cash down. Thcro were a lot moro who havo pre tended to bo populists or demo crats (for revenuo only) whose In flucnce was obtained. They wrote letters to theso dallies demanding Hartley's par don. When populists and democrats (who were not so for revenue) asked tho Dermis slon to reply, they were refused. Thcro wero other editors who signed tho Hartley petition. H was also presented to the In dependent, but tho prcicnter got no slgna turcs la this ofllcc. Tho action of tho World-Herald In this matter will call to mind the tlmo when It sold the uso of Us columns to tho renub llcans In the mtdst of a campaign. Hotter things were expected of Tho Hee. whose editor sometimes has opinions different from tho other republican bosses and dares to express them. Hut this tlmo there seems lo havo been enough In It to stop Ilosowater's mouth. Ho has been as dumb as an oyster. To this Indictment Tho Ueo pleads not guilty. During a career covering period of more than a ipiarter of a cen tury nobody has yet been able to muzzle The lice, either for money or any other valuable consideration. It will hardly be necessary for The Ree to prove an alibi to refute the report that It has been caught sleeping In the same bed with the World-Herald and Lincoln Journal If the "distinguished gentlemen" who are said to havo npproached Governor Poyntor with a $a,000 purse pretended that they had bought the silence of The Hee they simply Indulged In pure llctlon In order to persuade the governor to swallow the bait. If, as Is asserted by the otllclal organ of Nebraska populism theso missionaries exhibited 00,000 names attached to tho Hartley petition, tho name of tho editor of The Ilee was certainly not on the list. One other thing Is also curtain the "distinguished gentlemen" who had taken this benev olent task upon themselves wero dis creet enough not to tako tho editor of Tho Hoc into their confidence. While It was currently rumored that an attempt wus to be made to secure a pardon for Hartley, no action has been taken under tho law requiring notice by publication that would call for comment or discussion on tho part of tho press. No letters for or against the proposed pardon have been presented for Inser tion in The Hee and hence none have been either published or rejected. Whether other papers havo been sub Bldized In Hartley's interests we have no means of knowing, but wc do know that the Intimation that tho silence of fhe Hee has beeu bought is absolutely baseless. CO-OVEliA T1VK HOME lWlLDUa. If additional evidence Is needed to show the substantial foundation of prosperity In Nebraska and the marvel ous recovery lu all lines of trade and industrv from this disasters of seven years ago, It Is supplied by tho report of the condition of building and loan asso ciations, complied by tho secretary of the Stato Banking board. Tho report. a summary of which has been published n The Hee, shows the condition of these associations at the close of the ilscai year, Juno 30, 1900, and presents many facts of uncommon Interest. For tho tlrst tlmo lu llvo years the report shows a substantial Increase in the busiuess of home building asso ciation. They did uotf feel the full ef fect of business depression until ISltt, when their assets approximated $-1,000,-000. During tho four years following they showed a steady decline, nnd not until the last fiscal year did they feel to an appreciable extent tho widespread improvement In business. While tho aggregate assets of the sixty associa tions Is yet $La'J.r22 below the high water mark of 1S05, the report shows they have made a uet gain of ?:i01,r7r In one year, lu receipts tho Increase was if.'OD.im and in mortgage loans $.'1:1,557. Equally favorable Is the re duced amount of cash on hand, Indicat ing steady demand for money, and a decreaso of $02,000 lu the real estate ac count. Although tho number of asso ciations lu the stato has fallen from eighty-six lu 1801 to sixty at present, the number of" shares lu force has stead ily grown from 71,231 lu 18!H to 105,025 In 1000, ludlcatlug a membership of 10,000, tho largest In tho history of the state. Tho present number of associa tions have, therefore, a fur greater con stituency, over 30,000 more shares lu force, are rearing moro homes nnd have resources almost equaling the high record of 1S05. A very flattering exhibit, surely fluttering nllke to the associa tions and to the fostering euro of the stato In preventing nn influx of wildcat concerns from other states, and In hold ing In check speculative tendencies at home. Secretary Hall's recommendation ac companying tho report deserves the earnest consideration of tho Incoming legislature. Tho law governlug build ing and loan associations places them under tho supervision of tlio Stnto Hunk Ing iKiard. The secretary and tho ex aminers appointed by tlio board, who have to deal with theso associations, uro required by the banking law to have had, respectively, two and three years' practical experience In banks or in the Stato Hanking board. This dis crimination works a hardship on build ing and loan associations, Inasmuch as It subjects them to the supervision of men without exiwrleneo In their busi ness and Ignorant of tho principles on which they are grounded. Secretary Hall urges that tho legislature remedy tho Injustice by providing for a sop- THE

No serious hardship hus yet been worked by the discriminating quallllea Hon required for examiner. This 1 not tlio fault of the law. It due to tho men heretofore appointed. Ueed the associations of Nebraska have bee peculiarly fortunate, both in tho law enacted for their government and lu th oftlcers delegated to give them effect The present otllcers hnvo shown thorough comprehension of the principles o building and loan associations and hav always been lu full sympathy with their aims, otllclal sympathy did not however, relax efforts to hold them within tho bounds of safety or sauctioi ppeciilatlve Innovations. This Is shown In tho rules prohibiting separate expense funds and discrediting auxlllnry board operated by state-wide associations. The marked Improvement lu the coudl t ion of associations at tho present tlim Is largely traceable to tho fostering care of tho suite, and a fair measure o credit Is due to the energy and common seuso methods of Secretary Hall. milTlHll VOLWr is south afuica A few days ago Mr. Balfour said In the House of Commons that no member of tho cabinet had ever said that he had even dreamed the Hoer republics would remain permanently under the crown colony form of government. "That re strlcted phase of liberty," said tho gov eminent leader In the House, "will only bo necessary as a temporary expedl out." The speech of Mr. Chamberlain secretary for the colonies, on Friday made still more plain the purpose of the government to give the people of the lute republics n civil administration, In which they may participate, as soon as possible. Mr. Chamberlain said It was hoped this might be done beforo the house met ugulu, which will be in Feb ruary next. The colonial secretary declared that the government Is not animated by vln dlctlvencss against tho men in arms and that It had laid down three objects These are to end tho guerrilla warfare, to Institute a crown government when the conflict Is ended, and ultimately to give the people self-governnieut. In re gard to the charges of barbarism made against the Hrltlsh. Mr. Chambcrlnln offered n general denlnl, declaring that 'never In history had a war been waged with so much humanity." As to this, however, there Is so much trustworthy testimony lu support of the chnrges that the coloulal secretary's denlnl will not bo generally accepted. It may be true that there has been exaggeration as to the burning of farms nnd unquestiona bly tho Boers arc not In this mutter guiltless, but It Is not to bo doubted that there has been needless devasta tlon for which the Hrltlsh are chiefly responsible. That, however, much as It may, bo de plored, Is Irremediable. Tho Important thing Is the treatment to bo given the Boers when they shall abandon tho struggle. Tho promise held out by Mr, Bult'our and Mr. Chamberlulu is cer tainly reassuring. It Is better than was to havo been expected from the previous announcements or intimations of Brit ish iMjllcy. It appears evident that the nttltudo of tho Dutch In Capo Colony igalnst extreme measures In tho treat ment oi mo iioers, supported ny n strong sentiment In Kuglnnd, has had an Influence upon the cabinet The statement of Mr. Balfour, that ho real lzed deeply the terrible danger of em bittering tho Dutch lu South Africa, is manifestly shnrcd by his colleagues in the government. What effect, if any, theso declarations will have upon tho Boers remains to be seen. They uro being relentlessly( pressed by tho Hrltlsh, there is no hope of nny outsido help, oven Holland hav ing no Intention to Intervene, nnd their numbers uro dwlndllug. Probnbhy not to exceed 10,000 nro now lu arms. Un der such hopeless conditions It would not bo surprising If the Boers accepted tho promlso given by Balfour ami Chamberlain and gave up the struggle, which they could do without any sac- like of honor. 

SIIOHTUX Tin: viwsiutws message. Tho growing length of tho president's niessuge. making those documents In re- ent years such ponderous und formid able dissertations, may well nrouso ap prehension as to where it will loud, un less something Is done to check tlio tend- ncy. Tho constitution requires the president simply to give congress from line to time Information ns to the state of tho union and recommend to their onsideration such measures as ho shall Judge necessary and expedient. In the earlier stages of the repub lic tho annual message of the presldeut could bo mado to cover all the branches of government activity in detail, without becoming tedious or unwieldy. The gradual evolution of cnblnet depart ments with tho reports of their heads c viewing the work under their partic ular supervision left tho president free o refer only in a general way to their contents nnd to cniphnslzo such recom mendations as demanded special atten tion. For ono reason or another, how ever, the Department of Stnto has never ollowed tho practice of tlio other de partments lu transmitting to congress a separate report of tlio work under Its urlsdlction. Instead, tho foreign rela tions of tho government, in comprehensive- review, havo been Incorporated bodily Into the president's niessuge, as prepared by tho State department, and this accounts largely for tho ever grow- ug volume of the presidential docu ment. I'ho foreign relations of tho United States during the last few years havo covered more territory and embraced moro subjects than ever before. Not only this, but tho Inevitable consequence of American possessions In the Orient will bo to Involve tho country moro in world-power nctlvlty than was even dreamed of by the founders of the gov ernment. If tho president's niessago Is to be kept at all wlthlu bounds the State dc- 3 partinent will havo to make Its report on tho same basis us the other depart ments, relieving the president of minor details lu the formulation of his com niunlcatlon, which could then take th form of a critical commentary on all the work In administrative circles. Our for olgn relations would doubtless continue to furnish the principal topics for ills cusslon, but the niessago would appeal much moro strongly to the popular lu tclllgenee and command better attention from congress.

The statement of the senate commit tee on Cuban relations In regard to the postal frauds shows that Hathbono, the director of the department of posts for Cuba, well Improved the opportunity which his position affotded for reckless expenditure on personal account. 11 drew lavishly upon the public funds for supplying himself with luxuries, tho ills allowances by (ho auditing of tho Wa department amounting for sixteen months to over $72,000. Neely, who was chief of the financial bureau of the department, did not Indulge in such per sonal extravagance as Hathbone, but ho spent tho public money very freely Iho statement of tho committee simply a compilation of figures and makes no remarks or recommendations, It was probably deemed unnecessary to do so, since the case of these culprit is in tho hands of the proper authorities and undoubtedly will bo dealt with as tho law requires. Public sentiment calls for the punishment of the men guilty of the postal frauds in Cuba to tho full extent of the law and there Is no doubt that this Is the Intention of the administration. It would bo a re proach to tho government If Hathbono and Neely should escape the punishment they so richly deserve. iiEanioaTi' commissions iroKr. ltcferrlng to what has been done by tho reciprocity commission, tho presl dent snld lu his nunuul niessago that the failure of action by the senate upon tho commercial conventions submltlei to It at tho last session has caused much disappointment to tho ugrlcul tural and Industrial interests of the country, which hoped to protlt by their provisions. "The policy of reciprocity,' said tho president, "so manifestly rests upon tho principle of International equality and has been so rendlly ap proved by tlio people of tho United States, that there ought to bo no hesita tion lu either branch of congress In glv Ing to It full effect." It Is to bo hoped this suggestion will lnduco tlio senate to act upon the reciprocity ugreenieuts at tho present session. Moro has been accomplished In this matter than is generally understood Tho Joint secretary of the commission suites in un article lu the December Forum that four agreements havo been made under the third section of the tariff uet, which havo become operative by proclamation of tho president, no action by the, senate being necessary Under tho fourth section of the tariff twelve treaties have been made, seven of which are pending In the senate and tho others will bo ubiulttod to that body during the present session. This Is tho largest number of commercial trentles ever negotiated by ono ofllcer on the part of tho United States. A dozen reciprocal agreements wero effected under the McICInley tariff act, but Sec retary Osborne says that not ono of those agreements Involved so much dllll culty lu negotiation as each and every ono of tlio sixteen conventions nego tiated by Commissioner Knsson. Tho commercial arrangements con eluded in 1891-02 wero very satisfactory, but tho task was made easy by auspl clous circumstances. Mr. Osborne says that the plan of a Pan-American zo'll vereln, to bo bused on a system of re ciprocal treaties of commerce, wus en thusiastically received by tho govern ments of the various countries of South and Central America, and they fairly tumbled over each other In their zeal to take advantage of the reciprocity fea tures of the McKlnloy law. "In theh negotiations to this end they displayed, as a rule, u generous spirit Tlio con- cessions they could obtain from tlio United States were deilned In tho tariff net and wero tho same to all. They gnvo whatever was asked, usually with out haggling or hesitancy. Tho com merce of tho United States grow by leaps and bounds und both contracting parties to tho respective conventions were pleased with their bargnln." Theso arrangements were repudiated ami repealed by tho democratic tariff act of 1804, whllo tho present tariff law aroused reseutmcut In tho commercial world which was manifested In hostile tariffs and unjust discriminations against American products. When tho reciprocity commission was created it found everywhere a notleeablo In. Imposition to negotiate, tho situ- atlou In IJurono belntr even worse than lu this hemisphere. Under theso circumstances it is easy to seo that tho commission has had a dlfli cult tutfk and the fact of ho largo n number of commercial treaties having been negotiated attests the Industry and zeal with which Commissioner Knsson has performed his Important duties. Mr. Osboruo says that tho ratltlcation of theso treaties would go a long way toward the removal of existing causes of complaint and the expansion of the foreign commerce of tho United States, while on tho other baud their rejection would practically mean tho abandon ment of tho principle of reciprocity. .'he republican party being fully com mitted to that principle, it Is hardly oucelvablo that a republican congress will full to sustain it. Tho intimation lias como that, tho prince of Wales will attend the Interna tional yacht races for tho America's cup in this country next August, oil that Is wonted being a suggestion from resident McKinley that his visit would not be unacceptable.

Bomo months ago tho managors of tho Chicago, Hock Island & Taclflo railroad gnvo notlco that clgarctto smoking among Its omployos must cease. It was announced officially that nftor careful Investigation among the trainmen, tobacco had been found to bo physically, and to mentally, det rimental. Opinions of emlnout physicians wore quoted to that effect. Tho president of tho road averred that from porsonai Investigation ho was satisfied that tho ueo t cigarettes tended to "befog tho mind and make ono listless nnd careless In the dlschorgo of duty." Among all cmploy moutB, said tho prcstdont, with reason, a tear brain is especially needed In that of tralumen. Many of the Rock Island train men didn't tako tho now rulo seriously at first, but It was soon dlscovorod that It was meant to bo obeyed, Now tho Chi cago, Hurltngton & Qulncy system baa pub lished this regulation: "Tho uso of tobacco by employes In or bout station buildings or on passenger cara is prohibited." This clearly is not, In tho first place, to bettor tho health of tho Durllngton men. but to bettor their manners. Cigarettes nro forbidden only about station buildings r on cars frcquentod by the public: ana tho public will need no professional cer tificates to convince them that tho Dur llngton anti-clgarotto scheme Is well un- ortaken. Smoking on duty of any sort Is a sign of divided attention, nnd If them Is an emblem of lndlfferenco to tho world la general and, in particular to tho com pany presont, It 13 tho clgarctto left hang ing from tho lips a condition In which it Is so frequently found. Tho medical men may dobato tho sound- ess of tho Hock Islnnd theory that ciga rettes aro positively Injurious to tho mind, but tho public knows that the Durllngton theory that cigarette smoking is 111 man- ers lu Itself whon trainmen bring It in contact with travelers Is sound beyond dis pute'; Other roads will do well to follow tho example set by tho Uurllngtoa. iii.Asts I'aiiM
