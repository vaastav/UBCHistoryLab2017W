The United States Sur geon General's report says that the four colored regiments in our nrmy were the healthiest, and hud the least percentage of sickness and of deaths from disease, Of (lie whites 38 in each 1,000 on the avcage were constantly under treatment in tiie hospitals; of tiie blacks only 30 in each 1,000. Six colored men died from disease to seven whites. But this is reversed iu the case of wounds, for five colored soldiers died, on an average1, to every three whites. Mk. Cakmslk will be the fourth Kentuckian to be elected Speaker. Henry Clay was Speaker hi the Twelfth, Sixteenth and Eighteenth Congresses; John White in the Twenty-seventh, find Linn Boyd in the Thirty-second and Thirty-third. From Boyd to Car lisle there has been a lapse of twenty eight years, the States meantime hav ing the honor being Massachusetts, Mouth Carolina, New Jersey, Penn sylvania, Indiana, Maine and Ohio. Keifer has been the only Speaker from Ohio, not counting, of course, speakers ro tempore. The enterprise of James Gordon Ben nott and Mr. Mackcy in putting an end to'the Atlantic cablo monopoly by their contract to have a cable laid from Ire land to Nova Scotia, and thence to the United States, is generally applauded in Europe. It is charged that the pres ent Anglo American cable company has lived entirely by a career of finan ciering. It has bought up one cable en terprise after another, and its career lias been a continuous struggle to create an artificial monopoly. The Bennett- Maekey cable, when laid, will take half of the business, and even at a reduced rate a good percentage will be paid on the cost. If the choice Of Mr. Carlisle for Speaker in the Democratic caucus Sat urday night, bus any eigulfiance beyond the personal ambition which entered into the rivalry, it means that there is a determination among members of the dominant party iu Congress, to do something towards lifting the burden of taxation laid upon the shoulders of every consumer in the country. While the issue was tariff re form, it is not likely that radical measures will be adopted, but that, in stead, the policy indicated by t" i Ohio Democratic platform and since endorsed by other States, will bo made the basis of reforms which will prove, beneficial to the country at large Toledo Font. One of the grossest stupidities of all the legislation on our postal affairs is that which requires the post office in which a letter is deposited with insufficient post age, to open correspondence with the person to whom such letter is addressed, informing him that a letter awaits his attention, on which there is due post age to the amount general of one cent. The Government forwards this missile to the same destination that the letter with insufficient postage could have just as well been carried, and the delin quent amount collected there, but tho stupid law compels the payment of a three cent postage rate by an innocent party as a penalty for the delinquency of his correspondent. And yet our pos tal system is pronounced perfect! ... . Sufferers from nervousness, early de cay, etc., if you value life," avoid adver tising doctor and medicines that act on kidneys and liver.

'zt Three colored horse thieves, who stole a horse near Perrysburg, recently and were confined in Bowling Green jail, made a desperate attempt to escape, Saturday night. They sawed open the door that leads into the hall, and were about to bid adieu to their quarters when the sheriif's wiib discovered them and gave the alarm, they had a two foot bar of iron which they intended to murder the person who came to lock them in their cells. The sawing was lone with two case knives they had concealed about them, the sheriff took them to their cells and chained them to staples in the wall, and kept them standing on their feet until 10 o'clock Sunday morning, before they would tell where they hud concealed the tools with which they had attempted to effect their escape.

The following timely suggestions are taken from the Sewt Journal, one of the soundest and ablest Democratic pa' pers in the union: Signs multiply daily that the democ racy of Ohio intend to rebuke, so that it will never be vepeatcd, the effort to divide the Democratic party, to weaken its forces, and to split it into angry fac tional differences, and wholesale defa mation. Democrats recognise the right of every Democrat to aspire. . This is a free country, and democracy .exists to throw the doors wide open and to keep thewav to preferment open. It does not recognize the right of any paper, of auv man, or any faction to nulla up here by tearing down there. It is wil ing to sec any man pile up his own merits and virtues mountain high, and on these to mount as high as he can; but it will not allow that lie may make of another's defamcment way aloft for himself or others. There it is in a nutshell. Democracy needs all its strength, the power of ev ery Democrat, won by service and pa tient endeavor. It will have unity and perfect harmony. To this end it will allow of no such policy as pulling one down that another may rise. It allows that any men or the friends of any man may build him as high as may be possi ble, upon Ills own merits. The business of building up a Demo cratic faction and an official brokerage association for the control of federal of ficial patronage is not progressing rapidly-. Ohio Democrats nave had several words to say on this subject. Among other things it has dawned upon some minds which are not at all particular, that nothing could be done that would more surely prevent Ohio Democracy from ever having any official patronage to distribute. The defeat of bossism in Massachusetts on one Bide, iu Virginia on the other, ana the rebuke to the New York governor who undertook to tell the people who to nominate, have had a very wholesome effect upon the scheme for the creation of a Democratic bossism, a Democratic machine, and a Democratic omce uroKerage association. .Democracy means an end ot ma chines, of bossirm, of distributing offi ces only to such Democrats as may be designated by rings, politicians, and bosses as a means of rewarding bum mers for political services. The Demo cratic party will not destroy one ma chine to allow bosses and rings to set up another. It will not allow a reign of faction when Ohio Democracy needs all its strength for the great work before it. It has not strengthened the boss and ring movement that it is guided by those who have always given Ohio De mocracy a back seat in national politics and in the national councils of Democ racy. Purge out the lurking distemper that undermines health, and the constitu tional vigor will return. Those who suffer from an enfeebled and disordered state of the system, should take Ayer's sareapaniia to cleanse the blood, ana restore vitality. MR. TILDEN'S FREE GIFT. His Gramercy Park Property Intend ed for tho City. The Magnificent Property, With His Books, to go to New York as a Public Iiibrary. New York, December 1. There has been much speculation of late concern ing the purpose of Mr. Samuel J. Til- den in metamorphosing his comfortable old house m Gramercy Park and build ing an elaborate addition to it. To-day agentleman.well known for his position in the Democratic party, and as one of Mr. Tilden's oldest and most intimate friends, said to a World reporter: Some time ago Mr. Tilden's library began to reach such proportions that serious encroachments were made on the living rooms of his old house. He had always intended to leave his books to the city for a public library. After much consideration he concluded that no better site for a library could be found than his old house, if it was only i i -wr , . large cnougn. xie securea tne adjoin ing building, took Vaux, the architect. into his confidence, and the result is that Mr. Tilden has a handsome struc ture, so designed that he can continue to enjoy his old comforts and the loved society of his books the remainder of life. When lie goes it will be found that the house is admirably adapted for a library and literary institute. "But does not Mr. Tilden expect to live many years yet?" "Mr. Tilden is not a fool. None knows better than he that a man of seventy can't last very long. It is quite true, as Watterson says, that he would not accept the presidency it he were called upon to do so by every man, woman, and child in the country." "He lias not lost all interest in poll tics, then?" "No, he continues to take the deepest interest in tne weiiare ot the country and in the success of the Democracy. Samuel J. Tilden is now. and hence forth will be content to.be, an interested spectator." "Has he completed any arrangements tor the transfer ot rus House and Horary?" He has perfected all arrangements. Under his will the Gramercy Park house and his splendid library will be left in trust to the city for a public li brary. In this, to some degree, ho fol lows the example of John Jacob Astor. in founding the Astor Library, and of reter cooper, in erecting the Cooper Union. The Tilden institution will dif fer, however, from others of its kind in many particulars. This is known, how ever, only to tho trustees, and I do not think the time has yet come to divulge the contents of the trust deed." "Who are the trustees?" "Three of Mr. Tilden's old and valued friends Mr. Henry Watterson, of Kentucky: Mr. Manton Marble, and Mr. John Bigclow, of this city." "Can you give mo some idea of the value of Mr. Tilden's proposed gift?" "He has spent about $500,000 on the buildings, his books are worth nearly $100,000, comprising as they do the most extensive private library in the country. The property as it stands is worth i?l ,000,000. The amount of the endowment will be ample, I assure you." 

EIGHT Y-XIXK LIVES IOST. The French Plkhrrtiiau IVhoae Ilrig Sank Af,r CvlliiOon With an American Ship, i. Irt ails Bought to Port hjr the t'ollld. In Vernel Thorn an Dana. (N. Y. RmU, le. 1.1 Just off Bedloe's Island yesterday a big ship swung at anchor. She bore traces of a long voyage, and sticking from the timU-rs of her starboard bow was the ioint of a bowsprit. The paint about it was a trine scrntchea anil tarnished hut there was no fracture In the planking, and only tho name Thomas Dana, of Boston (recalling narrative of disaster that lias already been noted in the Herald cable des patches.) disclosed that the vessel was fresh from a collision in which eightv- nine human lives nan Iteen lost. The Thomas Dana sails under the American flag, and her master. Captain Sisson. is a 01 un American sailor, who deplores an occurrence so tragical, even though no title of its responsibility rests uion liliu Standing on the deck yesterday, he told the story of this sinister happening of the sea, of which he could only detail the scene he witnessed. Of the person nel of the unhappy beings who went down before his eves he knows little or nothing. They were all Frenchmen poor fisherman of St. Malo for the most part, who, after cruising about off the Newfoundland cost for a season trimmed their sails forborne when thev met their fate. According to the cap tain, the catastrophe was as sudden as it was uniookea tor. t here was no hus tle, little struggling in the water, hardly any work for the boats. Such as had not sprung for the ship's side at the first crash were carried under the water by the shattered craft which the one blow had crushed. . THE FATAL COLLISION. It was on October 22 that the Thomas Dana left Liverpool consigned to Snow & Burgress, with a lightcargo of chenu cals to Thayer & Lincoln. Tho trip was quiet and uneventful until October 30. On the morning of that day the ship was in longitude 15 deg. west, latitude 48 deer, north. It was pleasant weath er. The stars were shining up in the sky still, but it was becoming gray over head, and down by the horizon there was a whitish band where day was breaking. It was near six o'clock, and though it would not be clear for some time, there was light enough to see a (rood distance on every side. Frederick Tfaff, the second officer, was on deck. and Capt ian Sisson had just come up to him and was speaking about tho fine ness of the weather when the lookout hailed. The Captoin looked up. "A green light to starboard!" came down from the man. "All right, green to green's the rule," said the captain and he took out his pipe to smoke. He was looking for his match when a sudden cry rang out for ward and then came a bump. It was very slight. The captain first thought some one had thrown something upon the deck, but as he raised his eyes he saw a tangle ot spars ana rigging over the starboard bow and heard a clatter of tongues and a creaking of timbers. He ran forward, and suddenly a fearful spectacle was revealed. Low in the wa ter, just under the ship's bow, was a small brig close up to the side with her bowsprit piercing the planking and her (leek sloping downward to the sea. Her rigging was iu a snarl, and all hands had slunk down from their posts and were swarming forward. They were a poor, weather beaten set, with., dark faces almost blue with terror and big, straining eyes. Many of them were in the water, and those who came strug gling up went over the side. There was no mistaking what that meant. The brig was going down. Fearfully fast, too; for, as the captain looked over, she began to settle, and the poor wretches splashing about struggled away from her. No molasses and water mixture, but a concentrated extract ot the active medicinal properties of roots, barks, &e. is Hood's Sarsaparilla. The President's message, so-called, but which is evidently almost wholly made up in this instance by cabinet offi cers and department clerks, is about as barren of original ideas as a bill for mer chandise, and such parts of it as contain original recommendations of any im portance, to the citizens of the United States generally, are in the-wrong. He recommends the constitution of coast defenses as a means of distributing a portion of the surplus revenues. The United States has no more need of coast defenses than John L. Sullivan has for a cannon in his dooryard. He recom mends buying up the trade dollars at snch a price that the speculators who engineered tne raid upon the dishon ored coin will make a profit of 15 to 20 per cent, which is certainly unjust. He recommends the organization of militia in the States to be under the control of the federal authorities, a sort of nation al guard, contrary to the spirit and theory of Democratic institutions, and menacing thereto. He indirectly con demns tne idea ot a postal telegraph, wherein he again runs counter to the demands of the people. These subjects concern and interest the whole people anu are auoui tne oniy ones in tne mes sage in which the recommendations made are of any account and they are wholly wrong. Mr. Arthur is evident ly better acquainted with piscatorial affairs than the wishes of the American people. Penny Press.

New York Herald (Ind.): If the De mocratic leaders have energy and intel ligence the caucus action of last evening means a sweeping Democratic victory next year. For tho first timo in many years there is before the party a fair prospect of such popular favor as they have long been seeking by many devi ous and false roads. At last they are on the right track. The caucus vote will surprise a great many people. The re sult is a severe disappointment to the Republican politicians, who exclaim illogically, but loudly, that it gives them the next presidency. But the Republicans have one comfort -thev gave a complimentary indorsement to Mr. Keifer yesterday. They can never be lonely while they have Mr. Keifer.

Omaha Herald: The election of Mr. Carlisle is the most important and the most favorable event in the history of tne present year. Atlanta Constitution: Editor Romeo Reed, of Cincinnati, calls for "a consti tutional tonic." In Ohio this means two schooners of beer. incennes Sun: Deacon Smith calls the chanilcr of commerce, of Cincin nati, a collection of d fools. The dea con is a prominent member. Memphis Appeal: The tidal wave on which the present congress rode into power meaut something, and woe to those who prove recreant to their trust. Pittsburg Post: It hardly consorts with the dignity or intelligence of man hood to go into hysterics over' Imagin ary evus, or suggests the Aortli may be as easily frightened from its propriety iu irvvj as it was in ihuu. Philadelphia Inouirer fRen.): Ex. President Grant lies, almost forgotten now, as a mere politician in the crave in which the third term conspirators ruueiy miu mm. tie is not at all the same person as General Grant, the hero f oi our wars. Steubenville Gazette: The Cincinna ti Commercial says that Carlisle is from the center of population of the United States. This being true, the Commer cial should stop its childish remarks about the gentleman being a sectional speaker. Indianapolis News: Will some phil osopher, or physiologist, or statician ex plain why it is that but 4,831 men of the war 1812 survive, while there are 21.3,10 widows of soldiers of that war surviv ing? more than four times as many women as men. St. Louis Post-Disnatch: Tho Inlnrv done to the business interests of the country by the election of Carlisle is spreading.
