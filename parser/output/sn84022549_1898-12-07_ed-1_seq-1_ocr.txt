Miss Winona L. Brigham of Burlington, daughter of Rev. S. S. Biigham, has been appointed clerk ot the board of railroad commissioners and is the first young lady to hold that position. For the past year she has been clerk of the commissioner of state taxes, and was strongly recommended to the railroad - commission by many prom inent men of northern Vermont. Opening of Congress. Promptly at noon Monday the laBt ses sion of the 55th congress was opened ' at Washington with due formality. Probably not since the civil war has there been such a general interest in the deliberations . of this body. This country has made history and lots of it during the past eight months and the eyes of the world are upon us and our congress. Precedents ot a century have been set aside; our national, policy has been radically changed ; we are no longer to confine our national life to a sin gle continent or even a hemisphere ; if the policy of the administration is sustained we are to vie with the world in gaining and retaining the wealth ot the tropics. Not has and the since the dark days of civil rebellion there been such need ot patriotism statesmanship. That congress and president may make no false step is prayer of all the people. the The Death of Trade. The following propositions are self- evident. In a country village like Bellows Falls trade can be drawn from only a very limited territory; speaking generally the volume of trade which towns similarly situ ated can command is determined by the height of the land. This volume, this sum total, will be divided among the merchants in business. The strife, the competition, so-called, is to determine who shall control the largest share of the trade. It there are more merchants in any one line of business than could make a living if all the possible busi ness in their line was divided equally, or i one or two succeeded in practically supply ing the demands of the community, then some one or more must go to the wall, or at the most be content with an uncertain and unsatisfactory income. Every energetic business man is desirous of not only holding all the business he now has but also of adding to his list of patrons His new customers, unless new arrivals, must come from the list of some competi tor. The outcome of the whole matter is that whether in country or in city it is continual struggle year in and year out. Tbe Question is often asked. Isn't the fight too sharp P Aren't our keen, aggres sive business men in a measure killing themselves and their trade by being too aggressive. A merchant, whether doing business in Bellows Falls or elsewhere, has legitimate business expenses such as rent, heat, light, "clerk hire, etc., all of which must be paid out of his profit on the sale of goods before he can make a living even, to say nothing of securing a competency. He cannot sell his goods at cost and then throw off five per cent or give a premium and continne to float Ion;;. To one on the outside and unacquainted with tbe working of schemes, it appears that the mervhants of Bellows Falls are too philanthropic, Stamps, coupons, prem- : . 1 11 . .1 ntra na ram nir twnnnm mnm bt. iu , r. , B than cost, the multiplicity of devices is really confusing. When a tew merchants began giving out stamps, these few thought I they bad the drop on the others ; but later when the rest began giving out coupons, the matter stood just as it did in the first place, with this difference, merchants were petting five per cent less on their cash ' 8 sales. Tha customers made a little, but stamp companies more. o town U thrift which cannot boast of thrM mutant-, and a merchant who will give away all bis profits can 1 hardly be called thrifty. A business that - cannot by close attention, faaid work, vertising and courteous attention to the wants of the communi'y, be run with a reasonable margin of profit is worse than no business, worse for the business man and worse ior the community. Another Blizzard. The blizz ird of last Sunday, unlike the one of the previous Sunday, did not seri ously effect the New England coait. It did thousands of dollars of damage out at sea and raged with unabated violence in New York. It passed to the north visit ing weetern Ma-sachusetts, New York state and parts tf Vermont. In the vicin ity of Rutland the storm was especially severe. Buildings were unroor'ed and blown down, trees uj rooted, v'iadows, doers and blinds smashed andcatt'e killed. Here are a few instances reported from Rutland : "The most serious damage dene by the wind was the wrecking of a barn on George C. Thrall's place on North Main street, in which 20 head of cattle were crushed to death. Mr. Thrall estimates the loss on the building at $600 and the lots on the stock at about $300. The barn was a frame structure with a floor SO by 60 feet. There was a cellar under it and it was lighted by electricity. There were about 40 tons of hay in the barn. The cattle, numbering 61, were in the cellar and there were 77 head of sheep on the barn floor, all but one of which were saved. The ca'.tle, mainly Hob'teins, were mostly cows under three years old. The wind ap parently moved the barn several feet to ward the west acd the whole structure thf n collapsed. A part of the cows were buried under an immense weight of hay and were probably killed instantly. Others were so. badly irjured that they had to be killed as soon as they were taken out. A section ot the roof of the barn, about 20 feet square, was blown clear over another small barn and landed near Mr. Thrall's house. He heard this strike the ground, but did not think anything serious had happened till one of his neighbors rapped on his window and told him his barn had been blown down. This was shortly after 12 o'clock Monday morning. With the help of some more neighbors Mr. Thrall at once set to work to rescue the imprisoned stock. The party worked all night, but some of the animals were buried so deep under the hay and timbers that it was not until 4 o'clock Monday . afternoon that the last carcass was taken out." Several thousand panes of . gleW-Vere sold by hardware dealers and Glaziers Monday. The Bellows Falls wire was the only long-distance telephone connection that Rutland had Monday. Tbe Benning ton, Fair Haven and northern connections were all broken. The local excharge suf fered severely. There were about 80 wires broken in the city limits by falling trees. v The President's Message. President McKinley's message to con gress Monday was a record breaker for length. It filled 14 newspaper columns and set in minion at that. It is a complete history of the Spanish-American war, and touches upon many other matters of na tional importance. As liberal extracts from the message will be given in the Times Saturday, we quote only a few of the best things today. 

BUSINESS ACTIVITY. Notwithstanding the added burdens ren dered necessary by the war, our people re joice in a very satisfactory and steadily in creasing degree of prosperity evidenced by the largest volume of business ever re corded. Manufacture has been productive, agriculture pursuits have yielded abundant returns, labor in all fields of industry is better rewarded, revenue legislation passed by the present congress has increased the treasury's receipts to the amount estimated by its authors ; the finances of the govern ment have been successfully administered and its credit advanced to the first rank, while its currency has been maintained at the world's highest standard. Military service under a common flag and tor a righteous cause has strengthened the na tional spirit and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds be tween every section of tbe country. 

PENSION BOLLS. There were on the pension rolls on June SO, 1898, 993,714 names, an increase ot nearly 18,000 over the number on the rolls on the same day of the preceding year. The amount appropriated by the act of December 22. 1896, for payment of pen sions for the fiscal year of 1898 was $110. 000,000. Eight million, seventy thousand, eight hundred and seventy-two dollars and forty-six cents was appropriated by the act of March 81, 1898, to cover deficien cies in army pensions, and repayments in the sum ot $12,020 33, making a total of $148,082,892 79 available for the pay ment of pensions during the fiscal year 1898. Tbe amount disbursed from that sum was $144,651,879 80, leaving a bal ance of $3,431,012.99 unexpended on the 30th of June. 1898. which was covered in- i t0 he Mury. There were 389 names added to the rolls during the year by I special acts parsed at the second session of 1 . . .. . . f . , ... ths ootn congress, making a total 01 ooo pensioners by congressional enactments 1H. , - i since 1861.

The importance of legislation for the permanent increase of the army is therefore manifest, ana toe recommendation ot the secretary of war for that purpose has my unqualified approval. -There can be no Question that at this time and probably for some time in ine ruture, iuu.uuu men will be none too many to m3et the necessities of the situa tion. At all events, whether that number Bhall be required permanently or not, the power should be given to the president to enlist that torce if in his discretion it should be necessary, and the further dis cretion should be given him to recruit for the army within the above limit from the inhabitants of the islands, with the govern ment of which we are charged. It is my purpose to muster out the en tire volunteer army as soon as congress shall provide for the increase of the regular establishment. This will be only an act of justice and will be much appreciated by the Drave men who left their homes and em ployments to help the country in its emer gency. A Card.
