•I £v :l.y' 7V SUPPLEMENT- TO TWICE-A-WEEK PLAIN DEALER FRIDAY, DEC. 13, 1907 BY MEAD PUBLISHING CO OFFICIAL PAPER OF COUNTY ON III WORLD The Sixtieth Congress Under the Cannon-Aldrich Leadership De cides to Make Haste Slowly In CONGRESSIONAL Opening of Sixtieth Congress. The first day of the Sixtieth con gress was taken up largely with the routine business of Its organization. Pacific railroads former speaker had refused to re for any purpose for the next four or five years. lie declared further that the speaker had become the sole judge of what legislation shall be consid ered, whereas', in his opinion, the leadership of: the party should be upon the floor«of the house and not in the chair. Representative De Armond. Six-. Cooper's pro­ tect was seconded by De Anuotfd of Missouri and by Reader Williams. In reply Dajzcll of Pennsylvania said the rules had been proved effective in legis lation. aud the speaker said that the majority could change a rule when ever-it wan so disposed. He cited the faqt that the speaker is also a member and as such is entitled to refuse unani mous consent. This incident showed how completely the organization of the bouse was In the hands of Speaker Cannon and the men who liuve hereto fore surrounded him. Two big demon strations marked the house opening, one being the cheer given to the speak er «.wlieu he ascended the rostrum and the other for W. J. Bryan when he came on the floor, exercising his right as a former ineniber. Similar to coudltions in the house, the direction of the senate majority wan seen to center round AUlrlch of Rhode Island, chairman of the finance committee, to whom it was decided to give the privilege of initiating a new currency reform bill. He, with Crane and Lodge of Massachusetts, had been summoned to tire White House to con fer with the president on the financial situation. It was understood that Knox of Pennsylvania was to be ap pointed chairman of the committee on rules to sftcceed Senator Spooner, re tired, a position of great power In the senate. A striking figure among the new Senators was Jefferson Davis of {Arkansas, a round' --faced, physical giant who had announced his luten ti6n*of^jtlrrnrg-nT»-th» itiwuUiail sejjutCj. His maiden speech, however, was put off to a later day. The President's Message. In both house and senate the annual message of President Roosevelt was presented, the formal notice of the as sembling of congress having been made by a jotut, committee. The message fc (]££mii£nt of considerable length and c7vem^TOff^tWI"*i» various phases of federal activity .XUere were few new or striking fea 

PIPP hires, most of (ho ideas anil sugges tions presented being such as had he roine familiar to the public through the president's speeches during the past year, and on several subjects lie quoted freely from former messages, renewing previous recommendations. Perhaps the most novel nnd radical suggestion was that-, the government nhould pay the campaign expenses of the two great parties, thus avoiding the collection of large corruption funds. 1 Dealing With the Currency Problem—President Roosevelt In Message Stands Pat on Past Utterances—Government Payment of Campaign Ex penses Urged—Financial Situ ation Slowly Improving, Except For Weak Spots In the West. Central Bank Idea Gains-—A New Japanese Ambassador. Taft Talks With Czar. He referred to the energy and ln Just^ial ability of the American people and the fundamental soundness of our business conditions and deplored the practice of money hoarding. lie re Iterated the necessity of government control of interstate commerce and In sisted that the federal constitution lhe senate \4bs in session only half an tary Cortelvou for what he termed hour and did nothing but swear in new Johnston of Alabama could be sworn until the deaths of their predecessors, Morgan and Pettus, had been announc ed, as the senate adjourned In honor of the dead. In tlie house the only variation from the cut aud dried routine outlined by the leaders of the majority was the protest made by Cooper of Wisconsin against the rules of the last congress: Spenker Cannon had been duly elected In accordance with the unanimous choice of the Republican caucus on the preceding Saturday niglit and had been escorted to the chair by Williams, the Democratic leader, when the adoption of the former rules was moved. Mr. makes ample provision for such con trol, and iu this connection he would provide a federal charter for large cor porations doiug interstate business. A revision of the currency laws to pro vide for greater elasticity In the vol ume of the circulating medium is strongly urged. He renewed his rec ommendations for the Imposition of nn Income and inheritance tax, Indorses the postmaster general's plan for post al savings banks and the extension of the parcels post and would provide for abetter ocean mail service. The pres-^j ont system of protective tariff, he' thinks, should be preserved, but ad-! mlts that a revision of the schedule may be desirable. He strongly urges an inland waterway system both through the Mississippi valley and along the Atlantic coast, declares for a larger army, with better pay, and a material Increase in naval construction the coming year. A recommendation Is also made for representation at the Tokyo exposition in 1012. Chairman Fowlor Reappointed. ,. As an indication of a desire on the part of congress to deal promptly with tlie currency question Speaker Cannon departed from precedent In naming the house committee on banking and currency in the opening hours of the session instead of waiting until after 1 I the Christmas recess. Fowler of New Jersey, who recently criticised Secre- hls "inefficient members and call the roil. There was I financjai situation." The committee is a slight clash of opinions as to the or der of these two matters, Senator Lodge objecting to the course of Vice President Fairbanks iu having the sen ators sworn before the roll call and saving It was contrary to custom. The vice president insisted, however, that this had been the practice of the sen ate for more than a hundred years. The new Oklahoma senators, Owen nnd Gore, were not recognized, and their credentials will not be accepted until after their formal election by the new state's legislature Dec. 10. Nei ther Senator Bankhead nor Senator efforts to relieve the expected to organize at once. Culberson Leads Minority. The caucus of Democratic senators chose Culberson of Texas as chairman, a position which by custom carries with it the authority of minority lead ership in the' senate and which was held by his colleague. Senator Bailey. The tact that Culberson was elected without opposition showed that the revelations of Bailey's service for Standard Oil interests had deprived him of his former support. 

LEGAL CRIMINAL Railroad Obeys Alabama Law. Governor Coiner of Alabama announc ed that President Jimcrsou and Gen eral Counsel Alexander Hamilton of the Atlautic Coast Line had agreed to put into effect tlie freight rate named in the railroad rate bills and also the 254 cent passenger rate.

Cooper said that experience had con- ,, x.. a i. Z., Bitterman aud others. The action was vinced him that the rules gave too much power to the speaker and too lit tle opportunity for the members to rep resent their constituents. For instance, when he had refused to vote tor the to eujoiu llltterman ana-other-scalpers from dealing in uou-negotlable reduced fare Louisville and Nashville tickets. In the cases- of the Webster Coal company and the Pennsylvania Coal .. .... and Coke company against the Peun sylvauia Railroad company, the action have been sustained by reason of the road's discrimination in favor of other companies in the transportation, of coal, the court decided that the officers of the railroad cpuid be required to ex hibit its books for Inspection by the coal companies in advance of the trial to assist the plaintiffs In the prepara ,. .. 1 1 tion of their case. In the case of Thomas Polk and oth ers of Tennessee against the Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association of New York the court decided that the re Incorporation of the company had not violated any of the rights of the policy holders and that therefore the state law under which the company acted was noi in contravention of the federal constitution.

Only one juror had held out against the verdict for hours, aud he was for manslaughter. The crowd in the courtroom r#plauded the verdict, the technical ground of which was insanity induced by the ill treat ment of the defendant by Brown. fflW-7" Powder Trust Denies It All. Thirty-eight" of the forty-three de fendants named by the government in its charges of conspiracy and trade restraint on the part of the powder tj-ijstJimve filed answers in the federal court at*~WnmInstoir ail denying the harges. 'l he chief contention is that llie business is not uniavful because large and that the company had a right .lit iHH-ehase ptber companies or properties, when considered good in vestments. The -answers show how the smaller concerns were absorbed by the voluntary consent of both parties.

Postmaster General Meyer In his an nual report makes several recommen dations for Increasing the efficiency and extending the scope of the work of the postoffice department.

(Fowler 1 Prosperous Year For Farmers. The report of Secretary of Agricul ture Wilson for the year ending Juno 30 last indicates a period of great pros .perity for the farmers of the country although in some respects they were compelled to contend, with adverse con dltions which cut down the crop yield below the output of former years. In spite of this the high prices which pre vail have made the total value of the fafm products of the couutry far above anything heretofore known, rcacliln the stupendous sum of $7,412,000,000, or $657,000,000 In excess of the previous year. The value of the corn crop iilone Predicts Disaster. Upon the eve of the opening of con gress Representative Fowler of New Jersey, head of the house banking and currency committee, issued a predic tion of coming financial tragedy of far greater proportions than the present panic unless we stop issuing a fixed bond secured currency. I-Ie says that the banks of the country today have about if 12,000,000,000 in deposits and about the same amount of loans out standing, against which they hold re serves of only $900,000,000, of which $200,000,000 is in bank note promises. This he calls "the worst and wildest form of inflation." Ho defines it as "basing oue credit upon another cred it hence he deems the credit curren cy the safest because it would always be' sent to banks of issue promptly nnd necessitate proper reserves. 7 The Man Without a Party. The refusal of the house Republican caucus to admit Representative Peter A. Porter after he had expressed bis desire to bo counted among the Re publicans left that new member iu the role of tlje rpon without a party, for already he had objected to being listed as a Democrat. Torter was elected as an independent Republican in the Twenty-fourth New York district by a large -.majority over James W. Wads worth on the regular Republican tick et at the time Wadsworth was suffer ing for his stand against the presi dent's meat inspection bill i$ congress. That is why they say that Tarter "rodei into congress on a cow." Bryan Likes the Message." W. J. Bryan is quoted as being In accord with much of the president's message to congress. In particular he likes tho recommendation that the gov ernment pay the expenses of clectitons, only he would add a provision against private contributions. He also strong ly approves of the postal and guaran teed banks. Naming Fowler, Snub3 Pir.tt. The nomination of Edward S. Fowler as collector of the port of New York without the knowledge or approval of the New Yprk senators was regarded as a direct -snub of Piatt, who has al ways had much to say about this im portant political plum.
