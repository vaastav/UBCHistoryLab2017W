President Boos -volt's message to congress is said to be the long est document of its kind ever presented to that distinguished law-making body. It contains manv rood things; many sugges tions which, if heeded, would be of great advantage to the masses of our population. Mr. Bryan who, it seems be yond a shadow of a doubt, w ill be the nominee of the Democrat ic party for President next year, endorses nearly everything of importance contained in the mes sage: even the Government Pos tal Savings Banks. . "lotheiel W lin a tree" it seems that Mr Rrvan and President Roosevtlt are running on exactly the same ticket: the only difference being that one is named Democrat and the other "Republican." They believe alike, they look alike, thev think alike, they act alike and they talk alike. The fact of the business is if Mr. Bryan is the nominee of the Republican party there are thou sands of good Southern Demo crats would not give a cent which one was elected, for the whole - country has come to believe that both of the 11 are pure at heart and want to do and see done that which will be best for the Union. decided to ask Congress to ai- j moucv of tho country, wherever hoarded, , e-;-i 000 OPf rmnu-u - ; L l iU vs- i t.,.,w.ia-o t- tut.1 piopnatc- "ov,-- , , KIT Li- ILL lift iU.Ntnuao for the i rproyernent ot tne wa- QF
