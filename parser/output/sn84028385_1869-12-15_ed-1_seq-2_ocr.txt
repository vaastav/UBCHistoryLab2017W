The chronicle. TILLLiM IITEZEL. Editor ui Propristor WARREN. OHIO. WUKESD1T, DECEMBER 13, lSea. TERMS: $2,00 per Year In Adve.no. Renew Your Subscription.--Advance Payment. The end of the year is near, and as a number of the subscriptions to the Chronicle will expire with the year, we would call the attention of subscribers to the subject of renewing with the new year, as by so doin; they can better keep the run cf their newspaper account and always know when their subscription expires. It is hardly necessary for us to say that the terms of subscription are advance payment, and that we feel more than ever the necessity of making this role inflexible. We shall adhere to it here after, and although it may not be sat isfactory in some individual cases, we believe it will meet the approbation of our subscribers generally. Trumbull County Infirmary. On Friday last, in company with the County Commissioners, and the Infirm ary Directors, and several qther persons, we visited the above named Institution. During the put year a number of im portant and needed improvements have been added to the building, enlarging its accommodating capacity, increasing the conveniences, rendering a number of the rooms, that were formerly mere dens, lighter, more roomy, airy and pleasant er. Portions of the old building have been changed, much for the better, by adding to some places and taking from others. A large brick addition, 22x32, has been built to the north-east corner of the building. In the matter of outbuild ings there is a manifest improvement. Several large cisterns have been provid ed, and a considerable amount of sewer age, so indispensable to such an institu tion, has been constructed. The interior of the building looked clean and neatt and was comfortably heated throughout. A frame building, 18x30 feet, one room for an office, and the other' for a store room, is nearly completed. We are dis posed to believe that the Trumbull Coun ty Infirmary is now considerably above the average of similar institutions in the State. The Directors seem quite ready to do all they can with the mean sat their disposal to render the institution in every respect what it should be. In so doing they will have the support and good will of the liberal and humane people of the county. And here it is proper to state the fact that within a few years great changes in the management of the farm and Institution generally have been ef fected, and all these changes have been in the right direction. Prudent manage ment, industry, and economy have dis tinguished the stewardship of Mr. Lod wick, sinae he took charge of affairs. In other days the flour, meat, feed, Ac, needed to support the Infirmary, were purchased at a heavy annual expense. Xow the farm is made to produce these things, and instead of the Infirmary be ing a resort for a horde of pauper loafers, the dependents of the Institution, as far as possible, are provided with employ ment, and their labor utilized to the re lief of tax -payers. It is not doing injus tice to any of his predecessors to say that the present Steward of the Infirmary is the most successfnl manager who has yet had it in charge.

WHY NOT ! fcoiTon Chronicle : Is there any rea sonable objection why woman should not be allowed to represent herself? This verv oncnm is just whet has crushed woman. It may bo all well enough for a husband and wife to be called one, and the term oftimes has no deeper signifi cance we recrret to say. Oneness means the man always; he is the "head" and represents his wife in all legal enact ments, as well as many of minor import ance. Quite too long has woman known no individuality and sung the song that has been taught her from infancv, no cling and twine," and this verv educa tion has helped to make her the weak, imbecile being we too often lind her. Although there are noble exceptions, too many of the gentler sex still think it an accomplishment to lie called weak and helpless; a dependant doll and plaything, placed here to minister to the passions and appetites of men, and while away their leisure in idle nonsense and vain. frivolous amusements; never once dreaming they have a mind to develop, and an intellect to cultivate, which would help to improve and advance the nation. This class of women who bow to fash ion's shrine at the expense of health and life, are among those who are first to op pose Woman's Suffrage, being too indo lent to care for a change themselves, and too selfish to care to elevate their more unfortunate sisters who live by their daily toil. The extent of their ambition is too ofteii a French Corset and a Gre cian Bend ! What wonder that the world is peopled with beings physically and intellectually weak and deficient in so much that goes to make true manhood and true woman hood. Nature has created woman with a large healthy pair of lungs, with ample room lor tnetr expansion ; how sadly is nature perverted and hew deplorable the consequences. First, we must have strong, healthy, physical structures, (of course this depends on woman herself,) and then with proper culture and educa tional advantages, equal privileges and equal rights, woman will be fitted to be the mother of the race and an honor to the nation. Thanks to a wise Providence, proirress is the watchword, and when wo take a retrospect of the past and see the many avenues of employment open to women that have heretofore been closed against her, we have no reason to be discouraged, but feel and know that the commtr vears will place the ballot in our right hand, therebv making everv woman an in dividual and doing awav with nonenti ties. If there are any who do not want the rieht to vote thev need have no fears that it will be forced upon them. This is no anrument against us. Give it to those who are not willing to be taxed without the power Co represent themselves. Make woman an equal, place her beside her brother and give to both an equal chance to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happi ness;" teach her to know she was created with a high purpose; give her the en couragement her nature requires, and the husband and brother will find her a willing helpmeet, a wise counsellor and a woman every time !

Strange Story the Murder of Two Trumbull County Men, 30 Years ago, In Indiana. ' A correspondent of the St. Paul Press, of Nov. I, writes to that paper as follows: About a year ago, while stopping for a few weeks at a Dlace called Portland, the county seat of Jay county, -Indiana, the tacts ot the loliowmg strange story, con neetpd with the eariv settlement of that country, were related to me by a pioneer resident, Mr. Wm. Uaines, a venerable old man, whose veracity and integrity, as well as intelligence, commend him to the fullest confidence of all who know him. As the old man took his scat be side me, his eye twinkled with anima tion, lor he loved to recite the incidents of his early life, and live over again, in his vivid imagination, those trials and privations that he was once compelled to UDdenro. His story ran thus : About thirty vears airo, said he, I kept a small but comfortable tavern for the accommodation of travelers visiting this Dlace. many of whom were wealthy speculators others, perhaps, iu search of land, upon which to locate. Many times the tide of travel would be so great, that it would tax the ingenuity of the landlord to its utmost to render them comfortable, at times being compelled to roll themselves up in a blanket, and lie for the night upon the noor, or in tne Tiarn perchance. A liyle distance off, and in wnat was then considered an oui of the way place, was another public house, whose accommodations were considered scarcely equal to the first, and whose home-made nimi, hanging over the door, told the passer-by iu landlord's name was Thomas Wheat. Besides beinir the landlord of this un pretentious tavern, this Mr. Wheat had another occupation, one perhaps of more dignity, but less remunerative, that of minister, lie was oi me Aieinwust per suasion, and did all the odd jobs of his calling throughout the neighborhood and vicinity, and enjoyed the confidence of the public generally for integrity and honesty. - One cold, rainy evening in the spring of 1839, a man, accompanied by his son, a lad of some 15 years, driving a line spaa of horses, attached to a lumber wagon, whose only load was a large square chest, stopped in front of the tav ern kept by Haines, and inquired for ac commodations for the night. Mr. Wheat, of whom I have spoken, was near the door at the time, and as Mr. Haines stepped out to meet his guest, Mr. Wheat followed him. In answer to his ex pressed desire to "put up" for the night, Mr. Haines replied that his "conveni ences were limited, and his house full, but if you can 'bunk' on the floor I can keep vou." The stranger readily con sented", and they removed the oh est from the wagon and placed it in the house. Mr. Haines being an inveterate talker, and withal anxious to know where the stranger hailed from, and such particulars relating to his business as he could gather, continued : "Where are you from, stranger?" "From Trum bull county, Ohio," was the reply. "My name is Miller, and this is my son. I've come out here to buy land. Know of any for sale ? I don't "want many acres, I've only a thousand dollars with me, and must save some for other expenses!" "Oh, yes" replied Haines, who by this time had got the team unhitched from the wagon, "right smart of land about here," and so saying he drove to the barn, while the stranger with his son, walked into the house. But Mr. Wheat, who had been an attentive listener, em bracing the opportunity, informed the stranger that he also kept a hotel, and not being very full of travelers for the night, would 'be pleased to have the stranger stop with him, and receive bet ter accommodations than had been otter ed by Mr. Haines. The stranger, and his son, consented to go, and ordered his team returned from the barn, but lcayinR the chest, drove over to the house of Wheat. Sometime durinz the following morn ing, Haines met wheat, and inquired of linn as to the wellare ol the stranger and lire son. Wheat's reply was, that "the stranger had manifested a good deal of uneasi ness and solicitude lor his family during the night, and that he and his son had risen from bed before daylight, and start ed off on horseback for Ohio, promising to return in a few daysr" Haines thought this a strange pro ceeding, and that Miller must certainly be insane if this story was true, but he doubted it, and so expressed himself to Yt heat at the time, who seemed to mani fest a good deal of virtuous indignation upon his veracity being questioned. A few days subsequently, however, a neighbor of old Wheat, by Uie name of rteuDen uewm, wuus cuaracwrisiig uau was to find out everything going on iu the neighborhood, and solve the myste ries or other people s business, reponea that Wheat had murdered that man and his son, and sent off his (Wheat's) own sou with the two horses during the nicht. "and. furthermore." says he. went to tne Darn wnere x louna uie eartu had been recently disturbed, and ran a stick down till it touched something that felt like a man's body." A day or so after this a few citizens, headed"by one Joe Nixon, waited upon Wheat, and informed him of their suspi cions, and expressed their intention to examine his premises. Wheat's reply was, that he would "shoot down the first man that attempted it," when after a short parley they dispersed. Upon two occasions after this, did the heroic citizens of Portland attempt to search the premises of old Wheat for some trace of the mystery, and both times were they by him renulsed. and the subject was allowed to rest entirely quiet. The femily of Wheat consisted of his wife, lour sons, three daughters, one daughter-in-law all of whom were at home during the night of the supposed murder, except two daughters one married and one single A few miles Out from town Wheat held a tract of land, which had been mortgaged to the State School Fund, default having been made in the pay ment of which, he was alxuit to lose it, when to the utter surprise of everybody, he paid its incumbrances in gold. This renewed the suspicions of the public, for no one ever heard of his hav ing any gold, but still none had the moral courage to move for an investiga tion, and the subject gradually dropped. Wheat continued his ministrationsin the pulpit, for many of his congregation, be lieving him innocent, considered him tlie subject of the vilest persecution. Hut that "eye that never slumbers" had witnessed the deed of blood, and as "vengeance is mine, saith the Iorl," it was speedily visited upon the Wheat family, all of whom, except the two aliscn't daughters above mentioned, were witnesses to the deed ; even the son, who took the horses to Cincinnati, was cogni ant of his lather's intentions. In loss than one year from the committal of the deed the entire Wheat family (except the daughters already referred too, who are still living) were swept from the earth some by accidents the most hor rid and frightful, and some by sickness the most intense and agonizing. The old man died suddenly in church from a nt or apoplexy. Some ten vears subsequent to those events we find the old Wheat tavern passed into the hands oi one Mr. Black, who is presuming to do the honors of landlord, and about tins time tne to: low ing circumstance occurred: A Mr. B. W. Heller, a banker from Leesburgh, Highland county, Ohio, having business in Portland, stopped for the night with this Mr. Black. Upon being show to his lodging room, Mr. Heller closed the door and turned to walk away, when it instantly llew open, lie stepped up and again closed it- Again it flew open, in spite of ius fastenings, which were rent asunder like glass. Again ne closed it, and again it flew open with such violence as to jar the house, when he hastily re treated from the room, and declared he would not stay in tho house, and it was only when he had taken quarters else where that the recital of his adventure with the "door," reminded the bystand ers of the supposed murder in that bouse some years previous. But what that had to do with forcibly opening the door, and wrenching it from its fastenings by some invisible power, remains to be un ravelled. The occurrence of this ad venture of Mr. Heller spreading rapidly upon the streets in the morning, and with no fear of old Wheat, with his rifle to confront them, and refuse them ad mission to his grounds, the citizens, after a lapse or ten years, proceeded to revict for the remains of the missing, and set to work rnmaging the premises. Their efforts were rewarded by finding a box, back of the old house, and some three feet under ground, containing the bones of two human beings, some of which had been sawed once and twice in two in order to pack them. Thus was the mystery solved long after the Wheats had gone to their long homes, and after the affair had rested for ten years in comparative silence. I should have mentioned before that Wheat, the day before he died, had sold at auction the wagon and harness of his unsuspecting guests, as he alleged to defray expenses. The chest is still in the possession of Mr. Haines, though he had been repeatedly requested by Wheat to deliver it up to him, and upon opening it, some cloth ing, and a few carpenter's tools was all it contained. It is now but a few months since a gentleman residing in Trumbull county, Ohio, accidentally made the acquaintance in Cincinnati, of a citizen of Jay county, Indiana, and made some enquiries of him, as to whether he had ever heard of, or known a man by the name of Miller, who with his son, emigrated to that county (Jay) some thirty years ago. "That man," continued the enquirer, "teas ni brother." But the "Hoosier," having but recently settled there, was unable to give the required information, and should this meet the eye of that brother, sad though the intelligence it conveys, it may afford him some relief from 'those feelings of suspense and anxiety, experienced so many, many years, for the whereabouts of his brother. 

FIRES AT GREENVILLE. FIRES AT GREENVILLE. Two Bodies Burned Up--Suspiclon of Robbery and Murder. From the Greenville Argus, Dec. 20th. One of the most shocking, and at the same time most inysUjrious atiairs that has ever come within the experience of our citizens, occurred in this place about three o'clock on Monday morning, by which an aged couple were burned alniubt to ashes, if they did not first meet, if not a more severe, at least, a more horrible fate. The victims of this sad occurrence were Mr. Van Deusen and his wife, an aged couple who came to this place some few years since from the oil regions, purchasing a dwelling house In the suburbs, and, up to the fatal hour above named, lived among us quietly and unostentatiously. To a few only It was known that the old gentleman had brought with him a considerable amount of money, but how or where he kept it does not seem bo have been known to any outsider, further than the fact that, on the previous week, he had offered to sell gold In the place, which would naturally have led to the conclusion that it was available. The other antecedesui In the case would have rendered the event in question as a matter of course, while on the other hand, the fact of his having had mon ey, taken In connection with the circum stances of the fire, as developed In the In quest, leaves a horrid suspicion of foul play irom some quarter. The story of the fire is best told by the wit nesses at the inquest, which was called and conducted in due form on the day of the oc currence. Mis. Kramer, an immediate neigh bor, who seems to have been the first person on the scene of the disaster, testifies that about three o'clock In the morning she dis covered tire breaking through the roof of Mr. Van Deusen's house. She ran to the bouse, some 140 feet distant, and found the west kitchen door open; heard a door slam in the house ; she was the first to give the alarm ; Mr. Van Deusen and wife 6lept in the east room up stairs ; some time ago he told her they did not sleep together; had been on good terms, nowever, ior past no weeas; iney had a stove In the room below, and the pipe went up through the ceiling into the room above, and then into a flue: the fire broke out on that side of the house no person be ing with them or about the house ; saw no person when she went over. Isaac Kramer, husband of the above wit ness, testifies that his wife went ovr to the burning house in her night clothes, then re turned and aroused him ; he went Into the kitchen, and saw several persons there; the north-west corner of the house was not on fire at the time ; entered the house at the west window." From the main points in the testimony thus tar taken (the verdict in the ease will not be given until Saturday), we cannot but realize the presence of a painful mystery In the matter. The couple were not so old as to be decrepit; that tbey should both be burned to death as found, one still In bed and the other In the stairway, is passing strange. The fire originated In their bedroom ; If one could have got out of the room why not both; or, in case they were not together on this night, why should not the old lady at least have been out of bed The position of the old man, the knife, the open door, and win dow, the cries for help, and apparent previ ous lifelessness of the old lady, and various other circumstances, easily suggest robbery murder the worst. And yet it may all be an accident, Let ua hope so at least, until we know to the contrary, though, abating nothing- of effort in the meantime to reach a satisfactory conclusion. ANOTHER FIRE. On Monday evening, at about ten o'clock. while our citizens were still in a state of in tense excitement over the horrors of the morning, fire broke out In the second story of the building occupied by B. Grim a. Son, Main street. The engine was brought intoa good position near the canal, and the lire was soon checked, and in about one hour and a half entirely extinguished.
