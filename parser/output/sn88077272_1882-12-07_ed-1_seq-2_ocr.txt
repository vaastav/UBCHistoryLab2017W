Hon. E. B. Eshelman announces through the Wayne couuty Demo crat lhat he does not desire any clerk ship within the gift of the new Dem ocratic Secretary ol State. We make the same announcement to Mr. New man. Next. Old Simon Cameron, the brain3 stalwart of Pennsylvania, says the two factions of the-Republican party will never unite, and that the stal warts will vote with the Democrats in 1884, rather than have the Half Breeds elect a President. It will be conceded that old Mmon Knows a thing or two about politics. It is now stated that the loss by the overflow of the sugar plantations in Louisiana last spring was greatly over-estimated. The crop in Iberia parish will be nearly double tbat of last year say 225,000 hogsheads of sugar to.123,000, last year's crop. This year's crop may reach 250,000 hogsheads. J.N. Collins, sentenced to one year in the Ohio penitentiary for voting illegally in Van Wert Co., at the October term of court, was pardon ed out by Gov. Foster after being in but a couple cf hours. It is need less to say Mr. Collins voted the Re publican ticket. The purity of the ballot must and shall be maintained. The Bellfontaine Examiner sensi bly remarks that the Democratic newspaper or politician, that ..pre sumes to discuss the Ohio Senatorial succession until it becomes a prac tical question, or until after another Legislature is elected, is either, uu wittingly or otherwise, an enemy to the Democratic party. In regard to the systematic rob bing of mails in Colorado, a Denver dispatch says there is no doubt that drafts and postal crders aggregating $600,000 have been taken from the pouches within the last year, while the le ss of currency can not be esti mated. The more recent thefts oc curred October 2, 17 and 31 and November 7. In the sixteen Southern States and the District of Columbus the white school population is 3,899,961, and the colored 1,803,267. There are 16,669 colored public schools, 44 normal schools, 30 colored institu tions of secondary instruction, 12 colored universities and colleges, 22 colored schools of theology, 3 color ed law schools, 2 colored medical schools, and 2 colored deaf and dumb and blind institutions. There is talk at Washington that the Republican Congressmen intend to get even with the Democrats for beating them in the late elections hy cutting down appropriations so low that the next Democratic Congress can economize no further. When party is forced into economy and honesty by the stern rebuke of au outraged people, it deserves, and will receive but little credit. "The Cincinnati News." At last the Democrats of Cincin nati and Hamilton county have paper they can rely on, and we hepe they will "rally around its flag" and make it a "fixed institution." We have received the first four numbers of the News, and pronounce it equal in every respect to any other daily in the Queen city. The daily Neicx will be furnished at 15 cents per week, or $7 per annum, and we be speak for it a good round list in Ea ton. It is well printed, full of the latest news and has the true Demo cratic ring to its able editorials. Try it. The fatal accident at Cincinnati, on Thanksgiving day, during Frank Frayne's performance of "Si Slo cum," will probably prove the end of foolhardy sliootin.j on the stage. Frayne shot and killed Miss Von Behren, who, as "Slocum's" wife, was in the act of having an apple shot from her head by her husband, personated by Frayne owing some alleged defect in the gun the bullet passing through the poor girl's head instead of the apple. Every person engaged in such foolhardy business ought to be caged in an in sane asylum. The hard money of the country has now reached the enormous vol ume of $718,800,000, of which $512, 000.000 is of cold. On this solid basis, and other elements of nation al credit, about 825,000,000 in paper money is sustained at par, and $119, 000,000 of silver dollars intrinsically worth fifteen per cent. less. This is a happy change from the time when our coin was invisible, when our pa per was worth less than half its face, and our only "chancre" was sum- plasters. Foreigners should take out their first paper (delaring of intention to become citizens) from Probate Court as soon as they arrive here, or at least within the first three years, if they have not already done so at some other place iu the United States. This gives them a degree of protec tion from the government. Then, after they have bteu in America five years, the second or final papers can be obtained from the Court where they may happen to be, and that gives full citizenship, protection, vote and right to hold offie (except President and V ice President.; But it should be remembered that two years at least must elapse after tak ing out the first papers before the second can be taken, no matter bow long they may have been here before making the declaration of intention Says the American Register: Hon estly and justly should the laws be executed. No present good or nec essity of partisan policy can justify wrong doing by a party in power fhere will be no need, because of the decisive Democratic majority, for the substitution of the non-elect for the elect, and, whatever the vices of Republicau majorities when ejecting and seating members, the Democrats will not follow their unworthy ex ample. It was the loss of moral character that lost Republicanism its protracted mastery of the country Reformation in official morals is as indispensable as in practical political and partisan action. Republicans only ridiculed and despised Andrew Johnson because he coustantly ap pealed to the Constitution and the laws. These have been violated shamelessly and set at naught until the people absolutely proposed, in condemning the Republican party, to condemn perjury. Hubbell was only the impersonation of vices which the country abhorred. There fore the Democratic Congress, aside from its addictedness to the philoso phy of "strict construction," will obey the laws and interpret them with judicial and non-partisan fair ness. Men will be given seats, in cases of contested elections, as the law and right and decision of courts direct and not as partisan selfishness dictates. No such gross outrages will be practiced upon successful Re publicans claiming seats in the House as Democrats have been forc ed to tolerate, and law and right, in obedience to partisan necessities, will not be violated. Democracy means the government of the people, and the people in recent action at the ballot-box have shown thatthey condemn knavery and will approve honesty. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. [From Our Regular Correspondent.] WASHINGTON, D, C., Dec. 4, 1882. a a The Garfield Monument Fair has not been without disappointing fea tures, more especially with regard to its results. The extensive prepara tions made, and the large amount of labor and money expended thereon, entitled the affair to a liberal pat ronage, but evidently it has for some ren3-n failed to elicit the anticipated response. During the first few days there was serious doubt whether it would pay expenses, but later the attendance has -been better, though whether there will be anything real ized for the object in view is not yet generally known. It is not that there is any less regard for the name of Garfield now than heietofore, but in my opinion there would have been more public sympathy, at least here in Washington, if the Garfield Mem orial Hospital had been the enter prise to be advanced. There is a general feeling that the hospital would be a more appropriate and en during monumeut one which Gar field h imsc If, were he to choose, would better approve. Then, too, the time seems to have been unjudiciously chosen. Ihe Army of the Cumber land, so brave and successful in war, do not seem endowed with good prac tical sense in matters of this kind. Three years ago their society held its annual reunion in connection with the unveiling of the Thomas statue here, in bleak, snowy November weather, and Gen. Jeff. C. Davis, the vice-president, who hnd charge of the exercises, caught his death cold at the park on the day of the unveil aing, and his valuable life was termi nated but a few weeks afterwards. Unwarned by this severe lesson, the society again chooses the same sea son, and Thanksgiving week at that, a week when the American people travel less than usual, for holding a fair whose success depends mainly on people at a distance. How could the average citizen comply with the luscious Thanksgiving proclamation of President Arthur iu its true in wardness on the cold charities and perfunctory turkey of a Washington hotel? It is perhaps a minor con sideration that our beloved but chas toned Congress on its reassembling will find the Capitol as "cluttered up" as a dollar store. The office holders have not yet re covered from their consternation caused by President Arthur's recent bomb-shell, supposed to be aimed at the Star-route camp. It was un doubtedly a sudden and unexpected stroke, the meaning of which lies much deeper than the indication of a simple purpose to "purify the at mosphere surrounding the prosecu tion of these cases." me prime cause, so far as Mr. Attorney Bliss s concerned, was the desire to pun ish officials who have not paid that profound respect to himself which he thinks is due to the intimate friend of the President. It was up on the report of this smart prosecu tor, who draws $100 per day. and whose bills for the last year to tne amount of $34,000 have been approv ed by the Attorney General, that the action ol tlie President was tan.- en. let isnss is a very msigum cant person, nothing of a lawyer, and not so much above suspicion himself as to be a proper person for employment in such capacity. It was due to his manipulations in the iurv room that the late grand J i. . - T7--11 jury reiused to muici ivenug, ik United States Senator. 5ui on tne part of the President the late bold stand a complete change of front was the result of the recent elec tions. Mr. Arthur heard something drop Nov. 7th, and he is makingdes perate efforts to recover himself. There are circumstances almost with out number to sustain the view that up to the present time Mr. Arthur has had no desire to secure convic tions in these Star route cases. And now in the face of this sudden spasm ofvirtne the fact remains lhat the net in which the conspirators were to be co light was so woven or so cast as to hold the little iishes and let the big fishes slip through, and it is too late for the public prosecutors to disavow any responsibility for the failure of justice in the case. Ihe dismissal of these five officials is a good thing in itself. Whether it is a good thing or not for the interests of justice in the Star route cases will appear hereafter. When Brady and Do-sey are actually in prison, and not until then, peoj le will be prepared to score a point for the Administration. The orders issued in some Gov ernment departments recently, re quiring the clerks to do six and half hours work every working day and to desist from receiving visitors during office hours are the direct re sult of the late elections. Pension Commissioner Dudley is given to posing as a reformer. Some of his "orders" are famous for their bom bastic style, and excite a good deal of merriment about town. Ihe Com missioner of the Land Office, how ever, is not open to any such charge, but probably it occured to him that this is a very good time to turn over a couple of new leaves. It is a move by no means superfluous. The way in which time is squandered in the Government offices is wonderful The half-hour's intermission for lunch is generally spent on the street and the lunch time taken out of the Government's time. It is against this abuse that the Land Office cir cular is directed, as well as the prac tice of virtually stopping work half an hour before the office is closed The result of the late elections has been to cause a sudden spasm ofvir tue among the officials and an lm ( mediate cutting ott' of calces and ales. but it won't last. Now that the is sick he wants to be a saint, but his illness will not continue longer than a month or two. A darky of ficial is one cf the most amusing sights in the world the airs he gives himself, his immense importance. the grandiloquent manner in which he spreads himself in his office chair and surveys his omce desk are deli cious to the lover of a joke. Phono. Ex Senator Chaffee, Chairman the Republican State Committee Colorado, has published a highly in teresting review of the recent elec tion in that State. Mr. Chaffee makes serious charges against Senator N. Hill. He accuses Senator Hill of hav ing deliberately defeated the regula Republican candidate for Governor who represented the Teller Chaffee faction. This Republican quarrel in Colorado is only another illustra tion of the apparently irreconcilable feud affecting the party everywhere at the present time. B'ormerly policy was to silence personal quar rels and to restrain individual ambi tions, at least until the harmony the party was so far secured that success at the polls was out of jcop ardy. That day has gone by. Re publican factions now fight each oth er like Kilkennj' cats. Common Sense About Garfield. From the Philadelphia Record. It is about time that common sens was exercised a little in considering the life, manners, and morals of the late President GarfiYid. He did not have a monopoly of all the virtues, and he sometimes skated perilously near the edge of improper practices; at the very least he offended against that very wise and to a public man important canon which recom mends us to "avoid the appearance if evil." Since his unfortunate death hi3 friends and political associates have mistakenly tried to pface him on a pedestal as a paragon of perfec tion. This he was not, and their ef forts are probably as much due to their sorcliel self-seeking as to their hero worship. The Garfield Fair, which opens to day in the national Capitol, has been made possible only by the persistent pushing of these cronies, and b' a natural reluctance on the part of people of more sensi tive Susceptibilities to oppose any tribute to Garfield's memory. It is time now, however, to call a halt and to announce clearly that the reflect ed light from his life will not here after so dazzle the eyes of the peo pie as to prevent them from seeing the schemes of those formerly near to him. The successor of Dr. Updegraff in Congress, for his unexpired term, at least, will have to be chosen at a special election, antl at the same time, probably, his successor for the long term will have to be elected, as the term of a Congressman begins on the 4th of March. The President's Message will be found on our outside. School Examiners' Questions.

Twelve years ago Joseph Morgan was a poor ranch man in Ford county, Kansas. The other day he sold a herd of 4,000 head for $100,000 in cash. Six thousand petitions, bearing 679,000 signatures, in favor of a Sun day (J108ing Dill lor England, have al- eady been presented to Parliament.

Ten year hence the country can cel ebrate the 400th anniversary of its iscovery by Columbus. New York is already talking of a fair in that year. An eccentric Boston man, astonish ed by getting a pair of boots made just as he had ordered them, gave the maker a commission torbd pairs an he expected to need for the rest of his life. On the day that a divorce was grant ed to Mrs. Perkins, a Kansas woman, she was lying dead in the house and the body of her husband was hanging to the limb of a tree one dying ot heart disease and tho other commit ting suicide... Mrs. Wilson got a divorce from her husband, in Oregon, on the ground of cruelty. He reformed, and wanted to marry her again, to which she con sented; but he afterward changed his mind, and now she is suing him for breach ot promise. The Supreme Court of Iowa decides that a promissory note, properly fill ed out from a printed blank, except that the amount was not written out though put in figures iu the margin is worthless. The marginal figures are a memorandum only, and no part of the note. The Cincinnati Lancet and Clinic draws a gloomy picture of the uu wholesome condition of that city which.it thinks, "has not in the memo ry of man been worse." Certain local nuisances, it adds, "coupled with th vile sanitary condition iu which w live, present a broad invitation to th cholera germ to come and hold high carnival in Cincinnati. A long and active agitation of the question of tho Bible in the public schools, in Canada, has culminated in a formal demand upon the Dominion Government by those who favo Christian exercises for the pupils They state their ultimatum as follows "That tho Bible be used, not as a read ing book, but devotionally, in cornice tion with tho prescribed prayer, at the opening of the school each morn ing, and that both teachers and pupils read together the selection prescribed foreach particular school day through out tho year. W e do not ask that th Bible bo used as a text book in the public schools. We do not ask that tho teachers be required to give expo sitions or explanations of tiie mean ing of passages of Scripture." Two or three interesting cases o prayer cures have been published i tho uewppapers lately", and if they arc not hallucinations on the part of tl patients, as ofteu happens in like re ported cures, the age of miracles not passed.

Anna Dickinson has withdrawn from the stage, and is living with her sister and aged mother at Uonesdalc, Pa. "She and her family," says friendly writer in the Philadelphia Press, "are poor, but proud as ever. Anna has been importuned by her friends to return to the rostrum, but she will not listen to anything of the kind. The temperance people are es pecially anxious to enlist her services. Her disastrous theatrical venture took her last dollar. She looks careworn and somewhat sad.
