The military appropriations by the Insit Congress amounted to the sum of five hundred aud si.* toeu millions two hundr. d ami forty thousand uno hun dred uud thirty-one dollars (616,240,131).

At the commencement of the last session e.f ?\r>cre<!n? much had been accomplished towards suppressing tlio rebellion aud restoring federal authority over the insur gent States. But the rebels still held Richmond as the' capital of their so-called Confederaio government, and! the semlilan e of Slate (.overnment exisvx-i n H.lr ginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama;. Florida, Mississippi, and Texan, while a strong military force occupied a considerable pnrtiou of Arkansas aricU I^tuisiana. Their principal army, under** favorite com mander, (ioneral J,ee, defended with undaunted In nil impregnable positions around Petersburg und Richmond. Another army, under General Hood, was moving nortl:r with purpose to invade Tennessee aud Kentucky. Wont, of the Mississippi, a large force, under (Jen?-r?i Kirliy Smith, threatened Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri. The chief seaports o'" the rebel States ? Wilmington, < 'iiailea ton, -avannah and Mobile ? were strongly garrison' damn fortil.rd, and our blockading squadrons were unable to prevent trade and supplies reaching the enemy. Pirate steamers, built in foreign ports for rebol cruisers, armed, manned, equipped and supplied by foreign capita?, roamed', the high seas, burning our ships and destroying our commerce. Marauders, hired by the re l ie I government and harbored 011 our northern frontier, were setting on> foot piratical expeditions against our commcrce on the lakes, planning to burn und pluuder our towns and cities,, and were plotting murder against the President and Vice; President of the I'nilcd Slues, in hopes of overthrowing our government by anarchy. Kuith in their final suo cess and hope of open recognition by foreign govero mcnts still animated leading traitors. Til It KIT I'

But now the approaching session of Congress "/ill find! the authority of the federal government effectually i.nilt peacefully exerc sed over the whole territory of the United .-fates. All the armies heretofore arrayed against* the national government have laid down their oras am)', surrendered as prisoners of war. Every hostile banner has been hauled down, the so called Confederate govern ment Is overthrown, its President is a prisoner, In close custody, awaiting trial, while I's Vice President and threo of its chief executive officers have recently been en larged from prisou by yo.ir clemency. All the ordinances,, lrws and organizations created or existing under or by virtue of the so-called Con fed Mate government* have been swept away, and, by your sanc tion, the people or the insurgent states have or ganized or are busily engaged in organising Plate* governments, in subordination to the federal authority. In hurmon? with this new condition of affairs, the mili tary force of the federal government has been reduced, large armlos disbanded, and nearly a m Dion of biave^ m. n, lately soldiers in arms, paid and honorably mus tered out of S'.-rv.ce, have gone from camps, gerrh*uie> and posts to their homes, and most of them are engaged* already in the peaceful pursuits of civil life.

OPMIATIOV. Among the causes which, under Divine Providence., have brought about theso wonderful results, suoceasfnl* military operations stand first in order. A clear comprehension of those operations requires a> brief glance at the military position just before the Hiring campaigns of 1864. Tns SAvma or t:ik cimhkkiand a rait it iraxt at" Cff ATTAX'M UA.
