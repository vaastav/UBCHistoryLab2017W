Tlie United States has' sent to the Austro-Hun-garlan government a note of peremp tory character in regard to the sluic ing ol the Italian liner Ancona by an Austrian submarine and the loss o! American life. The nolo to Austria demands: A disavowal of the submarine attack on the ItaH;r'i liner; full reparation to the relatives of the Americans who lost their lives; assurance that such an attack will not be repeated, and punishment of the commander of the submarine aud others responsible for the act. In all respects, except Cor the stipu lation concerning the punishment of those responsible for the sinking of the Aiicotja. the -demands made 'Upon Austria are similar to thoso made upon Germany in connection with ithe sinking of the Lusitania and the Arabic. It is understood this action was tak en by Secretary of State Lansing as a result of the sudden renewal of sub marine activities by Austria against vaarmed ships and neutral freighters In, the Mediterranean, and may be taken to reflect an apprehension on the part of this government that Aus tria means to pursue the same course as that followed by Germany before the latter country was called to ac count by the American government. Case of the Ancona. At the time the Ancona was sunk it was alleged In statements obtained from BurYlvors that the ship was at tacked without warning and that the submarine opened fire with her guns en the Ubefoats in which the passen gers were trying to escape. Within a few days after the attack the Aus trian admiralty gave out a contrary version of the copy which was sent to Washington by Ambassador Pen field. According to this version Aus tria did not hesitate to admit that the attack was made by an Austrian sub marine, hut it was added that the liner had tried to escape after being warned, it was also intimated that the casualties were due to a panic on board the vessel. In view of this statement of the ad miralty, which, it was stated, was based on information obtained from the submarine commander, the state department was at a loss a week later to understand a dispatch from Ambas sador Pentleld stating that his formal inquiries had not been replied to be cause the Austrian government, find ing it difficult to communicate with the commander ot the submarine, de sired more time. While the state department has only the vaguest reports on the sub marine attacks on the American oil tankers Petrolite and Communlpaw in the Mediterranean, and while these ill oOC SUCCESS OF PARTY PREDICTED BY WILSON Washington, Dec. 9.

For th!3 reason it is believed the United States has decided not. to wait for another Lusi tania affair before filing a vigorous protest and demanding of Austria the same assurances exacted from Ger many. Many here are skeptical ot the way in which. Austria will receive this communication. It "is pointed out that that government would havo little to lose through a rupture in diplomatic relations, especially since Austria al ready has been obliged to recall her ambassador at Washington through objections raised by this government. The note will be made public within a few days.

The peace ship is threatening to con tradict its name. Internal strife has broken out and bids fair to become serious. Rev. Charles F. Aked of San Francisco, formerly pastor ot John D. Rockefeller's church in New York, has taken the leadership of those who are beginning to entertain doubts for the success of the trip. These mal contents demand to be shown, in plain terms, what the peace party ex pects to accomplish and what grounds lr has for so thinking. They insist on seeing the documents which Mme. Ro sika Schwimmer asserts she has with her to show that belligerents on both sides are willing to hear peace pro posals. Mme. Schwimmer, for her part, is defying the malcontents. She claims that the documents which she has are of a confidential nature, and refuses to allow them to be read. Henry Ford sent to the United States by wireless a lengthy attack on President Wilson's .message and Its call for national preparedness made by Kills O. Jones, qne of the delegates, in a speech before the as sembled argonauts. Mr. Jones holds tho president's national defeuse plan to be reactionary.

SOLONS FAVOR RESOLUTION Extends Life of the War Revenue Emergency Act. TO BEPASSEDBEFOHE HOLIDAYS Democratic House Leader Informed by Secretary McAdoo That It Is Highly Desirable to Adopt Exten sion Resolution Before New Year's In Order That Revenue Might Con tinue Vlthout Interruption. Washington, Dec. 9. Following a conference between Secretary Mc Adoo and Representative Kltchin, Democratic leader of the house, an nouncement was made by Mr. Kltchin that nn effort would bo made to -pass before tie holidays a re3olutlotf,ex tendlng tho, life of the war revenue emergency act, which under present authority will expire by limitation on Dec. 31. The secretary of the treasury In formed Mr. Kitchin that It was highly desirable that an extension resolution should be passed before Jan. 1, in or der that revenues from this source might continue wlthont interruption Democratic loaders appear to be con fident that the Republicans will in terpose np objection. The proposal to extend the HJte of the war revenue act will be consid ered at a mcotinsr of the committee on ways and means, to be held early next week. Consideration also will be given recommendation of the ad ministration that the present rate of a cent a pound on sugar be continued indefinitely. Under tho existing law cugar will go on the free list on May 1. It is the desire of the president that the sugar duty shall be main tajned at the present rate as a means of bolstering up the federal treasury. The sugar duty yields approximately fSO.000.000 a year. Later In the ses sion the way.s and means committee will draft a new taxing bill to raise funds - for the enlarged program of national defense. The president's plan of taxation, embodied In his message, has aroused opposition in some quarters. Most of the Democratic leaders. It is said, are opposed to a tax on gasoline, automo biles and bank checks, and there is a disposition to criticise the recom mendation to place taxes on pig Iron and fabricated iron and steel prod nets There is one feature of the pres ident's taxing plan that Is generally approved by the Democrats. This Is the recommendation that the exemp tions of the Income tax law should be teduced and the surtaxes Increased. Owing to the delay of Minority Leader Mann In preparing the Repub lican committee lists the house prob ably will be unable to do much busi ness before the holidays. Unless there Is a change of proeram congress will adjourn on Dec. 20 for the holiday period. The emergency act is expected to raise more than JSO.000,000. 

NATIONAL DEFENSE PLAN Senate Republicans Will Offer No Partisan Opposition to It. Washington, Dec. 9. President Wil son was assured by Senator Galliner, Republican leader of the senate, that the minority party in the upper house will offer no partisan opposition to the national defense program. The only condition placed on this assur ance by Mr. Gallinger was that the president himself should refrain from submitting the program to a party caucus, and thus giving It a partisan aspect. The president assured Mr. Gallinger that he had no thought ot seeking caucus action on the. meas ures. The president will see Minority Leader Mann of the house with a view to ascertaining the purposes of the house Republicans in regard to the national defense program. After leaving the president Mr. Gal linger declared that, while the Repn1 licans would not oppose the national defense program they would reserve the right to fight the ship purchase plan, which was put forward by the president as part of the national pre paredness program.
