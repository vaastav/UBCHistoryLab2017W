Boyood the paaaage of the regular appropriation bills, it seema probable that Titlit la the way of iegialation will be accomplished attbe ahortseseion,although lateral important propoaitions will doabtleM be pressed to the front. Among the memberi of the dominant party in the house, over half of whom wsrs defeated for re-election, there is a great deal of bitter feeling against the idmloiatration for real or fancied grievances. It will be the purpose of the Democratic leaders to curb, aa far aa possible, the display of reaentment. It the Freaideat outlines a financial icbeme in Ills message to-morrow, as anticipated, it will probably furnish Ibe opponente of his banking and financial views their desired opportunity.

IUI,aB lilt) IHUIUUD nuwnou ?? UUUM.V Vu appropriation billa will throw the doors open to remarks on any subject. Before the adjournment for the holidays it will be necessary to pass an appropriation to carry out the taritt bill provision levying a tax on incomes, tho collection of which begins January 1, and while it will no doubt meet with much opposition and lead to a general review of the arguments against such a tax, the general impression is that it will pais by a large majority. The impeachment of Judge Ricks, of the Northern District of Ohio, will also furnish a diversion before the holidays, if the judiciary committee which investigated the charges should present a resolution of impeachment and it should carry. The trial would occur in the senate, tho chiof justice presiding. Impeachment proceedings aro rare and novel, and this one, the first since the trial of President Johnson, would attract national attention. To-morrow, if a quorum is prosont in the bouse, as seems almost certain, after the calling of the roll nothing will be done probably beyond the reading of the President's message. No definite programme has been arranged for the remainder of the week. The committee on appropriations, however, has two bills aimost prepared, tho pensions and fortification bills, and they will be re ported on Tuesday, ao that work upon tbemcan bo entored upon Wednesday. THE 

SENATE. The senate will be callcd to ordor Monday at 12 o'clock noon when the last session of the Fifty-third Congress will begin. Tho vice president is in the city aud will preside. The session will begin with a lull calendar, the rosult of committee action during the long sea* (ion, and it contains at least two hundred items, covering a wide range of matters. Nothing has transpired to indicate which of these two hundrod questions will receive first attention, whether they will be taken in their order, or whether tho calendar will be followed at all. | Much interest is felt among senators of all political beliefs in the President's mesingo and in tho recommendations which the secretary of the treasury will make on financial questions. These will have much to do in directing the courso of the senate. If thuro aro recommendations for radical departures in financial method*, they nro sure to lead to much speech-making early in the session, and later to form tho basis of comn.ittoe actions. Significance is also attached to Senator Vooriiees' declaration that he will uk the finance committee to sit on Tuesday. Tuesday is the day for tho regular weokly meeting of this committee. but it il nu nnfc nr/iitinrilv mnnt an 1 promptly nftor the assembling of the senate. Chairman Voorhooa decliuoa to itate tho object of the mooting farther than to say that it ia to be held for tho purpose of permitting nn exchange of viewa among members. If tha President's message ia received Monday, tho executive recommendations could, of courao, bo taken up, but as there had been no positivo assurance to when the message would come in I the mooting wae docided upon, it would appear that tho chairman had other objects in view. ?. 

THOSE POP-OCN BILLS. H is possible that his purpose may bo to arrango a policy upon the aupplojnantal tariff bills. These bills hove oil been roported by the committee, but it toay be considered necossary to discuaa them further before deciding upon a plan of action. The Domocratic majority-of the finance committoo ia on 'ecord in favor of tho passago of tho hull, and it is not improbable that tho 7 action of the committoo is sought to'frustrateany attempt to provent con 'deration. This ia not altogether sur? *n?se, for it is known that somo of the o-called conservative senators have adJ'?ed that a general party conferonco bo ?aiu soon aftor the senato convenes lor the consideration of this question. The experience of last aeuion shows l&at whenever caucuses wero held tho conservatives carried thoir point. Jienco, there iaroason for tho prompt J^oool thefriondsof the supplementThere appears to be nothing out of flnincial or tar III questions likely to excite a ripple daring (be week and it it not certain ttoat, whatever may bappen later in the union, there will be much in theie linai to disturb the general serenity of the senate daring tbe next few dayi. After the receipt of the President's message, and when it gets to business, the senate may take up the calendar in regular order, orit may proceed to consider oat of order some of the more important bills which have beon reported, such as those for the admission of Arizona and New Mexico, or the bankruptcy, anti-option or Nicaragua bill. In any event the daily sessions of the week will bo short, with the probability strongly in favor of an adjournment from Thursday until Monday of the week following. A 

QUORUM PRESENT. So few members of either house of Congress wero to be found In Washington last week that there ill a Beamingly well founded apprehension that both tbe senate and the house might find themselves without quorums and he unablo to accomplish any business in the first week of tbe session. The hotel registers to-day show that there will probably be a quorum of members of both houses in their seats to listen to the President's inessago to-morrow. Senators and representatives have been brought to the city on every train arriving Saturday and Sunday. 

CAPTUHE OF SMUGGLERS. A Gnnc That Has Keen dwindling Uncle Sam for a Year It Caught. Dstroit, Mich., Dec. 2,?The police uid custom officer! have just run down a gang of smugglers who bave for over a year past been smuggling thousands of dollara worth of Turkish (embroideries and fancy goods from Windsor to Detroit. Four members of the gang have been arrested, two of the being women. .Most of the gooda were shipped to New York. Certain Armenian and Syrian merchants in New York hare been selling these goods at less than theircoattoimportera, butalthongb they were closely watched, the discovery of the smugglers was brought about by the Detroit police. The latter recently noticed that empty trunks were being carried into a room at 270 Jefferson avenue and taken out again filled and shipped to New York. The police detectives shadowed this ooeration Saturday, and tben entered the room and captured Asaph Ghobreen and Mrs. Selma Ghobreen, Syrians; Mrs. Kate Moore, of Windsor, and a young Italian from Now York named George Micalam. A trunk which had jnst been filled for shipment contained quantities of | costly embroideries and Turkish fancy goods valued at $1,300. Around the bodies of the two women were found $500 worth of the same kind of goods, which had just been brought across tho river, The duties on the articles would amonnt to about 60 per cont. Another thousand dollars worth billed for shipment was also captured. Government Inspectors Carter, Jennary and Downs are due to arrive in New York this evening whither they had gone to arrost John Abdelnor, a Syrian merchant, who is believed to be Selrna Ghobreon's husband and an accomplice of the gang. It was at first intendod to wire the New York officers to arrest Abdelnoor, but Inspector Carter preferrod to attend to the capture personally. Selma Ghobreen was arrested in Boston last year for a similar offense. KOLU'S PROGRAM JIB. lJelleved That He Slui]>ly Want* to Make a Record?A Quiet Sunday. Montgomery, Ala., Dec. 2.?In spite of hor dual government, Alabama has enjoyed as peaceiai ana quiet a ouuuay as any state in the union. Most of the visitors including the twenty-six companies of state troops, left the city soon after midnight last night. The enthasiaim politicians exhausted with tho excitement and anxiety of yesterday have been resting at their horao3 to-day. Neither Governor Gates nor Captain Kolb have been seeu on the streets. Tho council of the Populist leaders called for yesterday afternoon was not held. It has doveloped that there is a decided split in tho Populist ranks on the inaugurated movement. It hne leaked out that the members of that party in the legislature wero united against the inauguration of Captain Kolb and did all in their power by writing to their constituents to keep Kolb's supporters away from tho city to-day. -4 v.ik vjHIUUKUf a lib uio AUIU iimuKuiHHUii recall the fact that only two or three of the Popiiliat members were in the crowd which heard Koib'fl address. Kolb determined upon the inauguration scheme which culled his supporters here without consulting any of his party loaders. Those who wiil tolk acknowledge they would htve counselled against it. It has unquestionably produced friction in the ranks. Tho Democratic leaders hero think they know Kolb's purpose. They bolievo he limply wants to put himself on record. Governor Oates will sign tho certificates of the gentlemen declared to be elected, and Kolb hopes that the Republicans and Populists in tho houso will soat tho contestants, and thereby virtually recognize his as the proper credentials. Anowior morning ui mo jvuiuuuu ta called for to-morrow. No ono can stato at this time what will bo done after tho nioflsftse is sent to tho legislature until tho meeting to-morrow determine!.

A Scheme Co Give to the Business Interests of the Country a Bank No to Issue IteMponsive to Their Needs and to Retire the Government From tho Banking Duslnoss. The Currency Quofltion Discussed Fully? Itadical Changos in tho Present System Recommended. Washington, D. C., Dec. 2.?The report of Hod. James Eclclet, comptroller of the currency, submitted to Congress, gives full information in regard to the organization, .supervision and liquidation of the national banks tor the year ended October 31, 1804. It shows that | during this period but fifty banks were | organized with a capital stock of $5,285,000, the smallest number chartered, as well as the minimum amount of capital, in any one year since 1879. Of these now banks twenty-seven are in the northern and eastern states, ten in the southern states and thirteen in the western or trans-Mississippi division. On October 31, 1894, the total number of national banks in operation was 3,766, with an ac^orized capital stock of $672,671,366, represented by 7,955,067 shares of stock, owned by 287,893 shareholders. Un October 3, ism, too date 01 moir last report of condition, the total resources of the banks were $3,473,922,055, of which their loans and discounts amounted to $2,007,122,101. and money of all kinds in bank $422,428,192. Of their liabilities ?1,738,418,819 represented iidividual deposits, and $112,331,978 circulating notes outstanding. The total circulation of national banks on October 31, 1894, amouted to $207,472,603, a net decrease during tho year of $1,741,503, nnd a gross docreaso of $3,014,804 in circulation secured by bonds. During the year 79 banks, with an aggregate capital stock of $10,475,000 passed out of the system by tho voluntary liquidation, twenty-one, including two which failed in 1893, with a capital stock of $2,770,000 became insolvent and were placed in charge of*iecoivers. 

TIIE CURBBNCY QUESTION*. The feature of the comptroller's report is his discussion of tho currcncy question and the defects which are said, to exist iu the note issuing powers vested in national banks. On this subject he says: "No section of the law should bo disturbed which cannot be materially improved upon and no amenduiont engrafted unless such amendment will work out better results i than How from the exiling order of things. It is probable that thero could be no better plan for simply insuring the noteholder against lets than the present requirement of a deposit of bonds to secure a bank's circulation, but it is i equally certain, liowover, that a method could bo devised, not leas safe in this i respect, and in addition thereto possessing that which is essential and is now i wholly wonting?elasticity of issue. The complaint, therefore, made against i the present system is that, larking in i elasticity of issue, it fails to ineot as < fully as it ought the varying wants of i the country's trade anil commerce, i This defect muBt attach to every scheme I for a currency issued by tho banks i against a deposit of bonds, the market < value of which flactuates whilo the percentage of issue, less than the value of the bonds granted the banks, remains unchanged. "It is respectfully suggested that not only as good but better results would bo attained if the presont bank act were ( amended by repealing the provision theroof, requiring each bank as a pre- 1 requisite to deposit government bonds. 1 In lieu of such provision should be sub- I stituted one permitting the banks to is- , buo circulating notes against their assets i to nn amount oqual to at least lifty per , cont of their unimpaired capital." a safety fund. j The comptroller follows this sugges- i tion with tho furthor one for the ! muintainanco of a safety fund to be pro vided by graduated taxation upon tho J outstanding circulation of tho bank until tho samo shall bo equal to not less i than five per cent of tho total of such 1 outstanding circulation, this fund to bo i held by tno government as an agent only and for tbn purposo of immediately redeeming tho notes of insolvont 1 banks. it ia iintnodiately to be replen- i ished out of the assets of the banks, on which It aliall havo a first and par- < amount lion and from assessment to tho extant of the double liability on tho 1 shareholder*. Tho comptroller says: 1 "Whatever ofchor changes, if any, it would be necessary to make in tho pros- < ent system relativo to current redemp- 1 tion of bank notes and the government's position toward thp aamo and kindrod < mnttor, it is not nocemry to sot forth. It tho rocoiniuondations hore made, to- ' gather with that which will follow, > should recoivo consideration at tho hands of Congress, a hill drawn aftor caroful study and investigation of tho whole subject would noceisarilv om- I body all tho details incident to a charge troro a bond ton safety fund socurity ai abasia for bank circulation." TUo.cotnptrollor then citos sucli proof i and gives such statistics as seom to liiin ( to mnko tho plan supgovted a porfectly afe ono to ontor upon, liosays: "Tlio 1 changoi tliua outlined will, upon inves* tigation, it is boliovod, provo to be safe 1 in affording complete lecurity to the ' noteholder and give to the buiinoss interests of tho country a banknote issue responsivo to their needs." Continuing, tho comptroller novs: "The profit upon tlio issue of clrcula- < tion to tho bnnks by such cliaugo would bo so augmonted that it is giving to i thotn a franchise, for which it is sug* gestod they should bo called upon to make proper return to the general gov* eminent. This result should not, howover, bo of such a character a* to defeat theonds sought in tho privilego given. TO 

FIIBB THE GOVERNMENT. "The general govern mo nt ought to bo wholly frco from the direct ieiuiDR and J i redeeming of notes to pan as money among the people. No gorernment has ever yet successfully engaged in so doing, and ttie experience of the govern- ( ment of the United State* bai proven no exception to the role. "These issues out to bn redeemed and i cancelled and the government time en- J abled to retire from the banking ban- ( una, a business for which it ia to poorly equipped.'! 1 Intheligbtof the Dreaent condition ' of tbegovernment's linaneos, the comp- i troller continue!, that which ought to | have been done when there was a anr- , pins in the treaaury cannot no* be an- ( dertaken and the same conditions mint | continue to weaken the country'* credit | and plaguo the linea of basinets anlen i a means ia devised for removing these j iisuei from the channel of current re- , demption until such time as the gov- < eminent finds itaelf in a position to do j that which at first was the intent of ail i ?gradually redeem and cancel them. If the franchise ia granted the banks of issuing circulating notes against their assets instead of against a bond securi- ' ty, it ia suggested that the bnnka in return ehould recompense the government bv relieving the treasury depart- I ment of the current redemption in ooin , of the preaent treasury issues. The ultimate redemption of coin of course must all be upon the govern- 1 ment, but the embarrassment does not i arise irora ineir uiuoibw, uut iruui their current redemption. Aa against this deposit of legal tender* and treasury notes 00 made there should bo issued to the badks, dollar for dollar, national bank notes, either of the same or diflerent design as micht be deemed beat, that thus the yolumo of the currency aa itia now contributed to by the issues of the government should not be contracted so long, at leaat, as the banka making each deposita are in existence. The percentage of the bank notes issued against this depoait should be free from any taxation imposed upon circulation aud ought to be auch percentage aa ia deemed equitable tp be ased aa a part of the banka legal reserve held against deposits. The government should not undertake or in any wise become responsible for the current redemption of these notes. The elasticity of is&ue in tho national bank circulation will be found in the percentage of issue against assets, sub- , joct to the necessary rate of taxation and insured by an adequate safety fund to guarantee the note holders against loss. No violent contraction of the* currency would follow such a course, but whenever contraction occurs it would not be loss gradual than at other limos the expansion incident thereto. A CUHKE5CY C0MU18SI0H. It ia suggested that as a necessary element to the aocuring of proper elaa* ticity of issue in our bank note curroncy, section 9, act ot July 12,1892, regulating the retirement and issuing of circulation to banks within a flxea : period of timo, should be repealed, and ] also that an amendment should be made to the law necessitating tho < banks keeping in the office of the < comptroller of the currency a sufficient 1 amount of blank notos as will enable J them to secure circulation at once in- 1 itead of after a period of delay. I Suggestions have been recoivod from many eminent sources that the whole 1 question of a banking and currency ays- ? tem ought to bo referred bv Congress to i a commission to be created by law, ap- j pointed by tho President, and clothed t with propor authority. i A commission, non-partisan in its 1 character, composed of men ot eminent i abilities, could unquestionably devise a currency system sound in every part, t and one which would commend itself 1 to every interest of the country. It 1 could largely take the queation out of i politics, and have it considered simply f in its business aspects and upon its ' merits; but if the presentConereis is to t enact a law upon the subject, appoint- > ment of a commission could avail noth- 1 ing. If, however, nothing more defi- t nito can do accomplished, ins quuouua of the creation of such a commission i jught to bo considered and acted upon. 1

ATTACKS ON TUB ShiltCM. Claim* for the llaJiring Diphtheria Car? Opposed?Orrmitn Sewn Bsaux, Dec. 2.?A reaction against bo unmeasured claims advanced (or the mrative effects of Prof. Behring's diphtheria serum is setting in rather seriousy. 'The most significant utterance in ;his respect was made at a meeting on Wednesday last of the fierliu medical tociety, when Dr. Hansemann, an asais;ant in Prof. Virchow's pathological inititate, as moathpioce of 1'rof. Virchow liuiself, sharply criticiaod in detail Prof. Behring's serum therapeutic*. He deniod that the serum immunizes luman beings, and declares that no lufflcient proof had been produced rejecting its curative properties. Furfiermore, Dr. Hansemann claimed that ;heellectof serum treatment in many :asea was dangerous to health, and evon 10 life. The statistics thus far obtainibie of the results of the serum treatnent he pronounced to be unreliable md often misleading. Dr. G. H. F. Nutall, a young American physician, who ia now assistant irofesao'r of the Hygienic institute, of Berlin, in view of the fact that his share n the discovery of the serum treatment ias not apparently been clearly underitood, has made the following state nnnt to the Associated Press: He itudled in 1877 and 1888 under Profes- \ lor Fluegge, at lireslan and at Goot .insreu, and while pursuing experi- 1 nents in the laboratories he madecer- t .ain discoveries which enabled him to c lemonstrate for the first time that blood t >oss?88orf bacteriological properties, i :Io published the results of those a eaearches, among which was the fact c hat the blood of an immunized sheep i lestroyed more anthax, or bacilli, than he blood of non-iinraunized animals.

Mr. Burns, after ho had (tree tod the lommittee, asked to be excused for a noraent while ho glanced over a letter rotn a relative which had heen handed o him by Mr. (tampers, pleading that 'the solidity of labor began in the touHohold." Then ho talked to tho enreaentatives of the Associated Press. "It would be unfair for tho American >eople for me to talk about them now," dr. Burns Haiti, "for really 1 know very ittio about them. I was pleaded with he result of your recent municipal ilection in New York City, for, as we inderstood it, tho victory was in the nterest of pure municipal politics, and ia my principal work at present is as a ouu'ty councilor, it was particularly nteresting to me.

Mr. David Holmes followed with a ?w remarks and then tho party proaeded, democratically, on foot, to tho lolonnade hotel along West street. On lany of the corners wero gathered roups of dock laborers and cattlemen ho cheered (or Burns as he approachi and many of them who had como ora London greeted hi in with the old ry of tho London dock strike, "How re you, John?" to which inquiry Mr. urns rosponded by stopping and shakig hands with them. Later in tho day Mr. Burns received a umber of newspaper men and talked >r an hour. Of his own visit, he said he camo first > observe the condition of the labor tovemeut in America, and in what reject it diiTers from that in England; ?d second, a member of parliament, > visit Confess and get a grasp of merican political afiairs.
