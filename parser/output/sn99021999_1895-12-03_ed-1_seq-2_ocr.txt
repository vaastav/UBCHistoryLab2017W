SPEAKER RKED GIVES THANKS. It will not be unbecoming In me , I hope , If I ncknowledRo to this assemblage thnt It Is very agreeable to me to stand once more In the place which I left four ye.ua ago. Of tbo post , however , 1 nlmll not ppeak ; for-the past s-psaks for Itself In tsims more fitting nnd appropriate thnn njiy wordq which could come from my lips. Nor shall I Hpenlc of the future , for we are not putting off the harness , but putting It on. Yet 1 think I may venture to say of the future In the light of the past thnt If we do something which for the moment Feems Inadequate It may be thnt time , which has Justilled Itself for us on many occasions , may do so again. Those who have acted with wisdom here tofore may be fairly expected to uct with wisdom hereafter. I am norry to say that the pleasure asso ciated with the honor you have bestowed on me , an honor which no American citizen can fall to nppieclntu nnd far which I give thanks , In but for the moment , while the cares nnd responsibilities extend over many days. So far as the performance of my duties affects the whole people of the United States. I Invoke their considerate judgment. Ho far HH It affects the members of this house. I ask from both sides of the chamber- that cordial co-operation without which I cannot hope to succeed , assuring them that no effort on my part will bo spared to nld thrm In the lurformnnee of tholr dutloi by thnt entire Impartiality tvhlcn In their Ju t due. due.At At the conclusion of hl speech the mem- b"M cimo forwatd as their names were called , and with uplifted arms swore to sup port and defend the constitution.

Mr. Cannon and Mr. Dlngley explaining that the house was without rules and that the adoption of the proffered motion would furnish only temporary rules for the- guidance of the house until the committee on rules reported , Mr. Crisp withdrew his opposition , and the mo tion was carried. The biennial lottery , or seat drawing , was then begun , and , being concluded , the house adjourn.d un II tomorrow. An arrangement was entered Into by which the republicans should have the first tier of scats on the democratic side , and also the last two tiers. Three hundred and fifty-six names wore placed In a bonnd shaken tip. A blindfolded page drew out the ballots , nnd the members selected their seats aa their names were drawn. According to the usual custom , the house granted the ex- speaker. Mr. Crisp of Georgia , and Mr. Grow of Pennsylvania , the privilege ot selectIng - Ing their seats without drawing. Mr. Crisp selected a seat In the heart ot the demo cratic minority , and Mr. Grow took a seat near the center of the republican sld ? .

Mr. Illtt of Illinois , who will bo chairman of foreign affairs ; Mr. Hen derson of Iowa , w-lio will probably bs chair man of appropriations , nnd Mr. Walker of Massachusetts , who will head the banking and currency committee , were obllged.to con tent themselves with sats in * the last tier en the democratic side , known ns ths "Cher okee strip.

While some sections of Ne braska arc receiving considerable free ad- vortlslnR of their Irrigation matters , the Ulkhorn Irrigation company of O'Neill Is quietly developing nn enterprise nf no small magnitude.

Within the last four months this company his pur chased some 3.000 acres of the land lying under the canal , and tlila Is what It Is get ting In rcadinfss to Irrigate. It Is the In tention to put nil of the land under cultiva tion next season , and to accomplish this the company la making a very liberal proposi tion to farmers on a land , seed and water bas ! for a frmall share of the crop. There are nt present some BOO acres of this land In cultivation , nnd this the company will sacd to alfalfa In the spring. Already close to $50,000 Is Invested In this enterprise , and It Is safe to s.iy thnt when fully under way the amount will bo doubled.
