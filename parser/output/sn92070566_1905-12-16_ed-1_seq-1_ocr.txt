Our Job Printing Department Solicits Your Patronage VoL IX, No. 51. Alamogordo, Otero County, New Mexico, Saturday Horning;, Deo. 16, 1906. Subscription Price, $1.60 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Mr Roosevelt Cows the En tire Field in His Mess aee to the Congress. FOK 8TATKI100D. I recommend that Indian Ter ritory and Oklahoma be admit ted as one State and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as oue State. There is no oblig ation upon us to treat territorial subdivisions, which are matters of convenience only, as binding us on the question of admission to statehood. Nothing has taken up more time in the Congress during the past few years than the question as to the statehood to be granted to the four Terri tories above mentioned and after careful consideration nf all that has been developed in the dis cussions of the question I re commend that they be immedi ately admitted as two States. There is no justification for fur ther delay and the advisability of making the four Territories into two States has been clearly establisded. In some of the Territories the legislative assemblies issue li censes for gambling. The Con gress should by law forbid this practice, the harmful results of which are obvious at a glance. 

SYNOPSIS OF THE MESSAGE; The Nation continues pros perous. The vital factor in per manent prosperity is the high in dividual character of the aver age American worker. The doctrine of Socialism is condemned, although the term Is not employed. All are helped by making conditions such that men of exceptional reward Nevertheless, where there is no governmental restraint, some men of exceptional ability use their energies in ways prejudi cial to the common good Federal supervision and re gulation of corporations to pre vent restriction of competition from being harmful to the public is recommended. Corporations engaged in in terstate transportation should be dealt with first, The Interstate Commerce Commission, or some other administrative body,should be clothed with power, when it finds, upon specific complaint, a given rate unreasonable or un just, to prescribe a maximum reasonable rate- In case a rate has been cut for a favored ship per, the commission should have the right to make such cut rate the maximum for the line mak ing it, Rebating in all its forms should be stopped. It might be well to permit the railroads to enter in to agreements, subject to sanc tion of the commission, to "carry out the law." Legislation requiring the in troduction of the block system on railroads is recommended. Hours of railroad laborers should be limited. Courts should not be deprived of their power to issue injunc tions in labor disputes, but notice should be given to the adverse party before granting the writs. The class spirit should be dis couraged. Capitalist and wage worker should realize that they are properly partners. , Congress should consider whether the Federal Govern ment should further extend its supervision over life insurance companies. Congress should consider whether changes in the revenue laws are necessary, and whether reciprocity treaties with other nations should be negotiated. Economy is recommended, not, however, at the expense of the navy or Panama Canal. Elast icity should 6e given to the cur rency. Business methods should obtain in the departments. The steps looking toward a new peace conference are related and the position of this Nation toward peace and disarmament discussed at length. The popularity of the Monroe Doctrine is increasing. The United States has no purpose of territorial aggression. It simply wants the American republics to be secure and happy. They must, however, act right.

The army and navy must be improved. Promotions should be made for merit. Appropria tions for elaborate maneuvers are asked. Army poets should be consolidated. The coast ar tillery force should be increased. More men, more guns, more money for target and other prac tice, and more big ships are asked for. Ships of inefficient types should be discarded. The reclamation act should be extended to include Texas. The upbuilding of a merchant marine should be encouraged. Congress is asked to take ac tion to give effect to the sug gestion of President McKinley that the Nation should care for the graves of the Confederate dead. The immigration laws should be am mended so as to provide for the exclusion of undesirable elements. There should be pro per distribution in this country of the right kind of immigrants. A limit to the number of im migrants at'Noftliern ports, and no limits at the ports of the South, where immigration is needed, is suggested. Chinese coolies should be excluded, be cause the entire class is unde sirable for this country. Other Chinese ought to be admitted. Free trade between the United States aud the Philippines is re commended. I lie rate on sugar and tobacco should be 25 per cent of the present schedule until July 1, 1909, when the tariff should be abolished- Porto Ricans should be admitted to American citizenship. Alaska should be given an elective delegate to Congress. The Government should build a railroad from the Gulf of Alaska to Yukon River. The route of the Panama Canal and its feasibilty are no longer open to debate. The type is yet to be determined. An appropriation is necessary to continue the work. It is assur ed that excavation will be re sumed by the middle of next year. The consular service should be recognized. It should be ntau ued by salaried Americans and the fee system abolished. The consuls should have adequate salaries and proper buildings.
