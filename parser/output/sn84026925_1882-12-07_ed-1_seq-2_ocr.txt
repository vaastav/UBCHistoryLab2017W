Gen. E. B. Colston says the Egyptian fellah makes the best looking-soldier and worst Aghter in the world. This is somewhat like our friend Schneider's description of a certain railroad, which "might be the best one that went out of the town, but was the worst one that came into it." ? Secretary Seward betrayed a Cabinet secret to Thurlow Weed concerning the whiskey tax. Weed formed a combination to buy up whiskey and made, for his share, $400,000. That was the beginning of his great fortune. There was a deal of rascality at the bottom of the "war for the Union." ? In the criminal court of Baltimore, last Thursday, Thomas Foote, colored, found guilts nf hmtnllv ?<n?a.iiHincr nnd heatincr his wife" was sentenced to receive 13 lashes to be administered by the sheriff within the walls of the jail. This sentence is under the act of the Legislature of 1882. Notice was given of an appeal to test the constitutionality of the act. ? Congressman Hill, of New Jersey, says he believes his bill reducing letter postage to 2 cents will pass this session. The committee has given the bill a pretty careful study, and will, he believes, report favorably, and in view of the fact that the post office department has now a surplus, he believes Congress will pass the bill. ? A young^mau in Montezuma, Ga., fell in love, but was too timid to verbally ask his adored one for her hand and so studied up a novel way to propose. He sent her two different colored roses and asked permission to call that night, requesting her to wear the red rose if she would have him and the white one if not. He still dared not call with the presets of refusal and sent a friend ahead to seo which rose was worn. Everything was as our friend wished it, and he is now happy. ? A decision was rendered by the United States Supreme Court last Monday in the tax sale case of the United States, plaintiff in error, against George W. P. C. Lee, which involves title to the tract of land in Alexandria County, Va., known as the Arlington estate, which was brought in the Supreme Court by writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia. The judgement of the Court below in faver of the Lee heirs is affirmed. Opinion by Justices Miller; Chief Justice Waite and Justices Gray, Bradley and Woods dissenting. ? The Atlanta Constitution of Thursday says that on the previous day another batch of sixty-seven converts to the Mormon faith passed through that city on their way to Utah. The entire party were residents of Habersham county and were converted in that county and joined the church before leaving. Of the sixty-seven only seventeen were men. Many of the women were mere children. A woman had with her three babies, triplets, which she carried in a basket. The railroad fare was paid by an association in Salt Lake, cnnt tlm mrmpv tr? Georfria. some weeks ago. ? Says the Atlanta Constitution: The statistics of manufactures just published show that Georgia has 3,593 manufacturing establishments, having a capital of $20,672,410. These establishments give employment to 18,037 males, 3,619 females and 2,319 children. These people received in wages in the census year $5,252,952, and they turned materials of the value of $24,010,239 into products worth $36,447,448. New York is the leading manufacturing State of the Union, followed in order by Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio and New Jersey. ? While the Postmaster General has not yet formally denied the privilege of using the mail to Southern Matrimonial and Nuptial Associations, there is little doubt that he will ultimately do so. Assistant Attorney General Freeman, in trasmitting inspectors' reports upon these institutions, takes a decided stand in this direction, butrecommends that further inspections be made before acting in the matter. This recommendation has been adopted by the Postmaster General. Judge Freeman says that the only possible excuse that can be given for the existence of these companies is that they are incorporated under State Charters. ? The attempt of two trains to pass each other on the same track is not an uncommon occurrence; but it is seldom we read of a collision of three trains. This happened, however, four miles below Union Point, Ga., last Thursday morning. An up freight train frnm A ntriist.a while backing down for a cab car, which it had left at CJrawfordville, came into collision with an up passenger train. In a inintue after another up train ran into the sleeper of the passenger train. The collision occurred in a deep cut and on a curve of the road. Two engines and several freight cars were wrecked. One of the engines exploded. All the passengers escaped injury. Jack Sheppard, fireman, was painfully, but not seriously hurt. Considering the circumstances and damage to rolling stock, the escape from loss of life is remarkable. ? A recent census bulletin, published the other day, shows that of the 30,761,407 inhabitants of the United States and Territories, over ten years of age, 4,923,451, or over 13 per rent., were returned as unable to read. The number returned as unable to write is 0,239,958, or 17 per cent, of the whole. The percentage of illiteracy is at its height in New Mexico, where it ranges from 60 to 65 per cent. In Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and the Carolinas the percentage is from 50 to 55 per cent. Iowa is afflicted with only 2.4 per cent, of illiterates over the age named, and Nebraska occupies an equally enviable position. Only too many white j>ersons are included in the list of illiterates. Possibly they are none the less happy and contented localise of ignorance. Solomon seemed to think that; "in much learning there is much sorrow." ? Gen. Daniel Tyler died in New York last I Friday night. lie was born in 1799, and graduated from West Point in 1819. lie j went to France and studied the methods of light artillery and on his return his drawings were adopted by the government. He resigned from the army in 1835, re-entered du-; ring the Confederate war, was second in com- j maud at the battle of Bull Run, and during! the war was a member of the bureau of Engi- j neers. He quitted active service in 1864, and j then built several railroads in the North and South and was interested in several factories in Anniston Ala. From 1873 to" 1878 he was president of the Mobile and Montgomery railroad Company. He was elected director of the South Carolina Railroad Company about the year 1870 and had an influential voice in the reorgaization under which Mr. Magrath was president, and Alfred L.

YORK V1I.1.K, S. C.: ! THURSDAY MORNIXU. DKC. 7, 1882. INAUGURATION CEREMONIES. Governor Thompson was inaugurated last Tuesday, and the State ollicers inducted into their respective offices. The inauguration ceremonies were conducted in the Hall of the House of Representatives. The proceedings j were of an impressive character, but unmarked by any pomp or display. After the inauj guration Governor Thompson delivered to the j assembled Senate and House his inaugural adj dress, occupying the Speaker's desk. GOVERNOR HAGOOD'S MESSAGE. This admirable State uaner is printed in full in this week's issue, and we commend it to the perusal of our readers. Like every paper that has emanated from Governor Ilagood, it is a clear, business-like document, carefully prepared, and as an exposition of his methods during his term of office reflects favorably ; upon his purity, faithfulness and conscieni tiousness in the discharge of his public duties, and his ability and patriotism as the Chief Executive of the .State. In retiring from the office which he so ably filled, Governor Ilagood deserves, as he will receive from the j entire people of the State, the plaudit?"Well ] dofte, good and faithful servant." THE LEGISLATURE. The Legislature has been in session a week and is fairly under way with business. The proceedings thus far, however, have been marked by no event of social importance. We are indebted to our valued exchanges, the Charleston Xexcs and Courier and the Columbia Register for the reports published in these columns. In the Senate, on Monday, Mr. Patterson, of Chester, offered the following resolution : That a joint committee of the two houses be appointed, consisting of two on the part of the Senate and three on the part of the House, which shall be charged with the duty to inquire and report whether the hall of the House of Representatives was used in November last for a public ball and the State Library for a supper room, as was stated in the daily papers, and if true, by whom the permission to so use these halls was given, and under what authority, and as to the propriety of allowing them to be so used. The resolution was adopted after a short debate, and ordered to be sent to the House. A number of bills passed their second reading, and several new bills were introduced. In the House, a number of bills were introduced, and several bills passed their second reading. Tuesday was appointed for the Senate and House to take the preliminary vote for United States Senator, to succeed Senator Butler; and ? " L" Uaiipa tirnvA f /\ ni nt Ull HIC bwu liuusu nuc i,<-? univ ui^i in joint assembly to take the decisive vote. It is generally conceded that Senator Butler will be his own successor. MEETING OF CONGRESS. The second session of the Forty-seventh Congress met on Monday. The Senate was called to order at noon, by President pro torn. Senator Davis, of Illinois. After prayer by the Chaplain the customary resolutions were adopted for the appointment of committees to notify the President and House of Representatives, respectively, that the Senate had convened and was ready for business. Neither Senator from South Carolina was in his seat. The Speaker opened the second session of the House at 11 o'clock, 202 members present. The President's message was read in both Houses. The message is lengthy and elaborate. Southern comment in Washington is that it betrays an anxiety on the part of the President to heal the breach in the ranks of the Republican party by adopting the well-known and recently-approved features of the Democratic platform. The only adverse criticism heard generally upon the Republican side of the Senate was upon the proposition to abolish the tax on to bucco. Senators Windom and Allison among others expressed themselves as not in accord with the message on this point. Senator Logan said the message was satisfactory, and indeed masterly. Senator Ingall.s in his incisive j way said brusquely : "The tone of the mesj sage is ambitious." Taken as a whole it was ! regarded hv the Senate with satisfaction. | 

CHARLESTON MUSICAL FESTIVAL. J The musical festival held in Charleston last j week, marks an event of which the people of that city, and of the entire South, may feel justly proud?it being the first attempt of the | kind in any Southern State. From the vai rious reports we have read it was a grand success, financially and musically. Dr. August Doepp was the projector and indefatigable manager of the enterprise, in which he was ! ably assisted by Mr. Otto Miiller as musical director. The singers and instrumentalists i comprised professionals and amateurs from > Wilmington, Raleigh, Charlotte, Augusta, j Atlanta, Savannah, Columbia, and Cincinnati, besides the talent of Charleston, which was by no means inconsiderable. The musicians who mainly captivated the audience on every occasion were Mr. and Mrs. Schultz and their little son Amadeo, of Atlanta?the father and son in violin parts, and Mrs. Schultze on the niano. Of Amadeo. Mr. 1. K. Orchard, him self a fine musician and competent critic, writes as follows in the Columbia Itcyistcr: But what shall I say of Amadeo?"the young Baganini of the South'"?as he was enthusiastically proclaimed ? A bright, healthy young boy only eight years old ! And yet, what a marvel, what a prodigy! He essays recondite solos which severely tax the skill of old and experienced violinists and renders them with precision, feeling and power. The idea of this mere boy playing without flaw and with proper expression De Beriot's Seventh Concerto! And yet he did it, thereby producing the wildest enthusiasm among his i hearers, who could scarcely credit their sen-1 ses. Not only did he perform difficult solos ! with spirit and effect, but he played at sight the exacting first violin parts in the orchestra, eliciting the commendation of the entire body of singers and players, lie possesses the style of an artist and does nothing in a boyway. He appears to have a conception of the composer's thoughts and reproduces them with ,Melity and artistic skill. This remarkable fj^iolinist was born in Berlin, and his careful his due to the untiring attention of foundesti$fttl)er'' w'10 ranks among the proof this NoTft??0^ the day. But enough Amadeo's * powers^*^11 can do Bistice to heard to be appreciatethSsiii^ SP("'n and SOUTH CAROLINA NEWS. ? Mr. John C.

Mr. William Mooney, a veteran of the Mexican war and an old resident of Columbia, died in that city last Thursday morning after a long sickness. He was a member of the Palmetto "Regiment, was wounded while in service, and drew a pension from the government. ? The special election in the town of Spartanburg on Tuesday of last week, on the question of license or no license resulted as follows : Total vote 72(1; no license 459; license 287 ; majority for no license 152. In spite of a raw rainy day, the election was without incident or trouble. ? Mr. James G. Wheeler, a tenant on Mr. J. R. Welsh's plantation in Flat Creek township, Lancaster, planted this year sixteen acres of cotton and twelve acres of corn. He worked it with one mule, and had no assistance in the cultivation of it but his wife, lie gathered sixteen bales of cotton and seven hundred bushels of corn. ? Notice was made some time ago in a suit for damages by H. F. Malloy, of Edgefield, against the New York Herald for the publication of a telegraphic dispatch in which it was libelously alleged that Malloy had burned down his store to secure the amount for which he had insured it. This dispatch was sent from Columbia to Mr. I. Edward Orchard. The trial of the case was set for yesterday, in New York. ? A horrible murder was committed about thirteen miles above Camden last Thursday morning. Mr. F. M. McDowell, a gentleman well known and highly esteemed throughout the county, was brutally murdered by a negro named Joe Wilson. The weapon used was an axe. The negro, after committing the bloody 1 deed, dragged the dead body of his victim to ( a ditch near by and covered it with brush. The negro lied, but efforts are being made to capture him. ? Moses Lockhart, colored, was hanged at Edgefield at 1 o'clock last Friday for the mur- , der of Moses Blaloek, last April. Blalock enticed Lochart's sweetheart away from him and the latter shot him dead on sight. The gallows was formed of upright posts and a i cross beam with a figure four trigger and a trap-door. When the trap was sprung the" condemned man dropped four feet. The hanging was private, but was witnessed by hundreds from windows and tree tops. Lockhart was resigned to his fate. ? The Carolina Spartan says that the Clifton Manufacturing Company of that county, has just received an order for 500 bales of their popular shirtings to be sent to China. This mill is now spinning nearly thirty bales of cotton a week, and there is a ready demand for every bale of goods. The reason is that the goods advertise themselves. Wheu once used purchasers wish more of the same sort, i If another mill of the same capacity could be 1 started at the same place, and under the same efficient management, the demand would only be increased. ? The committee of the New England Man- 1 ufacturers' and Mechanics' Institute have recently conferred with a number of prominent men in Columbia with reference to the great: Boston fair next fall, and are much encour- j aged by their reception. They left Columbia for Atlanta, Georgia, and are satisfied 1 that the Southern States will occupy a prom- 1 1 inent place in the approaching exhibition, i The officials in Columbia and numerous mem- 1 j bers in Columbia are much in favor of South 1 I Carolina doing all she can to bring her re- ' i sources prominently before the New England ] | public. 1 ? W. J. Mixon, a United States Commission-1 er, living at Barnwell C. II., who was promi-1 nent last Spring in making arrests of citizens j ' charged with violation of election laws, met his death Thursday morning near Itoseville, on the South Carolina Railroad. He boarded . the down passenger train at Columbia, having . purchased a ticket for Barnwell, and sat quietly in the rear passenger coach until the train j was moving away from Roseville, when he ' j went to the platform and jumped off. He 1 fell to the ground and his head struck one of the cross ties, causing an ugly wound. ' ! He lay insensible until picked up by Conductor Speisigger, who had charge of the train, and was carried to Branchville, where he shortly j after expired.

There will be 401 electoral votes in 1884, and j t 201 votes will be required to elect.

The late removals of the star route sympa- j thizers by the President have led to much in- i dignation by the Star Route fraternity and f their friends. The removed officials talk about <] demanding an investigation of the charges al- y leged against them. 'j ? Within the past two weeks two Congressmen have died?Mr. Ileron, the Congressman elect from the Sixth District of Louisiana;) and J. T. Updegraff, of SteubenviHe, Ohio, j Republican member of the present Congress,! and member elect of the next Congress. ?

In Kansas the Democratic candidate for Governor was elected, but nearly all the other State, ticket candidates are Republican by t!8,- v 000 plurali'y. The colored man McCnbe, who ran for ti e Auditorship, fell behind 18,000 -y votes, but pulled through by 20,000 majority. ' ] lie is the first colored man ever elected to a ,J State office at the North. j a ? Says the New York Sun : ''The internal ; revenue abomination must be abolished. The j tariff must be revised, with just consideration Q of all interests affected by its operation. No more money must lie collected than can be' tl properly expended, and taxation in every form must be adjusted to distribute the burdens equally. Class legislation must be stopped, j Sinecures must be repealed. The lobby must be starved out." ? The "Washington correspondent of the New York Evening Post says it is estimated that there will be some fifty contested election cases in the next Congress. "It has come to such a pass," he writes, "that every defeated candidate, where the majority against him is small, takes an appeal to his party in Congress." Perhaps there would be less of this if there were fewer instances in which the losing contestant is re-imbursed out of the public purse for the expenses of the after-election contest. 

SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE. The General Assembly of South Carolina i met in Columbia at 12 o'clock M., on Tuesday | the *2811] ultimo. There was a full attendance in both houses.

Hon. James Simons of Charleston was declared to be elected Speaker. On motion of Mr. McKissiok of Union, a committee of three was api?ointed to wait upon the Speaker-elect and escort him to the chair, where the oath of office was administered by Colonel Simonton. The committee appointed consisted of McKissiok, Ansel and Massey. On taking the chair Hon. James Simons tendered his appreciation of the honor bestowed upon him by his fellow members in a short but well-conceived address. When the chair announced that the House was organized and ready for business, Colonel Simonton moved that the House proceed to the election of the subordinate officers. The motion was carried, and the old officers were reeelected without opposition as follows : John T. Sloan. clmk ; John D. Brown, Sergeant-atArms ; R. M. Anderson, Reading Clerk.

The term of office of jihe commissioners succeeding those first appointed to be six years. The commissioners under the l)ill will have power to prepare a schedule of rates for the government of railroad companies in their charges, and authority to compel the enforcement of the same. This bill is framed on the model of the Georgia bill, and it is claimed by Mr. Ansel that while the bill will secure to the people their rights it will not ornate with hnrrishit) on the cornorations.

We regret to record the death of Dr. C. P. Sandifer, a well-known physician who resided about 7 miles east of Yorkville. His death occurred last Sunday night, and was the result of gangrene. l)r.

The pig was only 13 months old ; md this fact shows that pork could lie raised in South Carolina, if our people would only Lake proper interest in this important department of agricultural economy.

Hugh G. Jackson was called to render surgical aid in both cases. THE TRANSIT OF VENUS. One of the greatest astronomical epochs of he century occurred on yesterday, it being lie transit of Venus across the sun's disk?an vent which will not occur again until the ear 2004, a period of 122years. Astronomers 1 lave been making the most careful preparaion for this grand event, all for the purpose )f obtaining a more accurate determination if the sun's distance from the earth. An er- ! or of 1-20 of a second in the time of the trail- \ lit counts half a million miles in reckoning listance, and hence the necessity for the most 1 iccurate instruments possible, and the most ! >xact observations. No event of the century s comparable to this, in the estimation of ( hose enthusiastic men whose lives are devoted ' o the study of astronomy: and they look d forward to it with corresponding interest. ' I'll is is the lifth time in the history of man in vhich this phenomenon has been observed. j )ur own government made extensive preparaions for its observance and observers were asigued to various places throughout the counry. A party of German scientists were staioneil at Aiken, in this State, for observation. 1 A HKII.1.1 ANT MARRIAGE.

IH'Tl'S PANORAMA. Butt's panorama of scenes illustrating the old Bible, and his panorama of Revelations will he exhibited in the Court House next Saturday and Saturday evening. Mr. Butt is an artist of rare ability, and his last production, illustrating the Old Bible, is spoken of as a master work of art. Speaking of its first public exhibition in Charlotte, where the panorama was painted, the Observer says : The exhibition of Mr. Arthur Butt's new paintings at the opera house la.st night was perhaps the first occasion in its history when the opera house was completely filled. Edwin Booth once drew a packed house, but his crowd was not so large as was that which as- ?sembled last night to see the panorama. It was scarcely dark before impatient groups began gathering, waiting for admittance, and by the time the exhibition begun, there were no seats to be bad and one was satislied to find comfortable standing room. We had already prepared our readers to expect something strikingly beautiful and grand, and none were disappointed. A brilliant calcium iight thrown ,, upon the canvass drew out the pictures with . good effect. An appropriate and interesting / lecture explained each of the thirty scenes, f It / is a wonderful work on canvas, and one must ' j see it before its beauty and grandeur can be comprehended or realized, and wherever the talented young artist goes, we give him the most cordial recommendation and can assure the public that the money they spend on his entertainment will be happily and most profit- ? ably invested. Not one of all the crowd present last night would stay away if the exhibi- / tion were to be repeated to-night. 

SALES-DAY. ] December sales-day is usually marked by . a large attendance of people, and last Monday was no exception to the rule. There was quite a large amount of real estate to be sold, but the principal attraction to a majority of the crowd was horse trading and swapping, a sales-day pastime in which many seem to indulge merely for amusement. Stock generally was in good condition, but it was noticed that no horses were sold for March delivery. All transactions were on the spot, on a cash basis, and good prices were obtained.

In very relation of life Mr. London was a genleraan of unexceptionable character, .and the \ latience with which he bore a long and very willful illness fully attested the sincerity of aith which for many years, had been a markd feature of his career. He leaves a large amily ; and a very large circle of friends and cquaintances will read the announcement of is death with sincere regret. 1 ?

He, after eating his dinner, took is gun and went out, as if to hunt. His rife found his dead body a short time afterwards with the clothes burning.
