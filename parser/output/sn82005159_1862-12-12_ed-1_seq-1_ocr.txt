Ftllow Cititen* of the Senate and Home of Rep• reecntativcs: Since your last annual assembling, another year of health and bountiful harvests has pass ed, and, while it has not pleased the Almighty to blesa us with a return of peace, we can but prase on, guided by the beet light He gives us, trusting, in His own good time and wise way, all will be well. The correspondence touching foreign affairs, which has taken place during the past year, is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a roqueat to that effect, made by the House of Representatives, near the close of the last ses sion of Congress. If the condition of our re lations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is cer tainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhap pily distracted as we are, might reasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers, which, at the beginning of our domes tio difficulties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we thihk, recognized the insurgents as a bel ligerent, would soon reoodc from that position, which has proved only less injurious to them selves than to our country. But the temporary reverses which afterwards befell the National arms, and which were exaggerated by our dis loyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that simple act of justice. The civil war, which has so radically chang ed for a moment the occupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social conditions and affected very deeply the nations with wliich we have carried on n commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. It has at the same time, excited political ambitions and apprehensions, which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy, between foreign states, and betwoen parties or factions in such states. We have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no resolution. Put wo hare left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs. Our struggle, of course, is contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its suppose 1 and often exaggerated effect", and the consequonce resulting to those nations them selves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government, even if it were just, would osrtainly be uAwise. The treaty with Groat Britain for the sup pression of the African slave trade, has beon put into operation with a good prospect of suc cess. It is an n/~ "•*- -* ■-t—. p""-—" acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of Iler Majesty's Government, has been mark ed with a jealous respect for the authority of the United States, and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens. The convention with Hanover for the aboli tion of the state dues has been carried into full effect under the act of Congress for that pur pose. A blockade of 8,000 miles of sea coast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting unintentional injaries upd for eign nntions and their subjocts. A civil war, occurring in a covfltry where foreigners reside and carry on tmdc under trca ty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of com plaints of the violation of neutral rights ; all such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear eases of these kinds, I havo, so far as possible, heard and redressed complaints which have been presected by friendly powers. There is, how ever, a large and augmenting number of doubt ful eases, upon which the Government is tiiA bla to agree with the governments whose protec tien is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many eases in which the U. States or their eitisens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations, which the governments of these states are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some wf the foreign states thus interested, mutual conventions, to examine and adjust such com plaints. Thie proposition has been made espe cially toGreatßrltain, toFranee, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each ease it lias been kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted. I deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in be half of the owners of tho Norwegian bark Ad- SotTal P. Tordons Hivla, which vessel was, in May, 1862, prevented by the commander of the blockading force, off Charleston, from leaving that port with her cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been grant ad to an English vessel. I havo directed the Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper commit tee. Applications have been made to mo by many free Americans of African descent, to fa vor their emigration with a view to such colo nization as wfts contemplated in recent nets of Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad, some from interested motives, others upon pat riotic considerations, and still others influenced by philanthropic sentiments, have suggested similar measures; while on the other hand, se veral of the Spanish Amerioan Republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these cir cumstances, I have declined to move any such colony to any state, without first obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement •n its part to receivffand protect such emigrants in all their rights of freemen, and I have at the same time offered to the several states situated in the tropics or having colonies there, to nego tiate with them, subject to the advice and con sent ef the Senate, to favor the voluntary emi gration of persons of that class to their respec tive territories upon conditions which shall lie

Liberia and Hayti are ns yet the only countries to which colonists of African descent from here could go with cer tainty of being received and adopted as citizens, and I regret to say that such persons, contem plating colonization, do not seem so willing to emigrate to these opuutries as to some others, nor so willing as I think their interest demands. I believe, however, the opinion among them in this respect, is improving, and that ere long, there will be an augmented and considerable .emigration to both these countries from the U nited States. The new commercial treaty between the Uni ted States nnd the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution. A commercial and con sular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia, and a similar ne gotiation is now pending with the Republic of Hayti. A considerable improvement of the tia- tional coram jrcc is expected to result from those measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Den mark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Homo, and the other European States remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also con tinue to bo maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan. During the last year there has not only been no change of our previous re lations with the independent states of our own continent, friendlier sentiments than have herc tafore existed arc believed to be entertained by these neighbors whose safety and progress are so intimatoly connected with our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru and Chili. The commission, under the Convention with the Republic of New Grenada, closed its sessions without having audited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it. A propo sition is pending to revive the convention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The commission between the United States and the Republic of Costa Rica has completed it 3 la bors and submitted its report. I have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europe, by au Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from San Francisco to connect by a Pacific telegraph with tho wire which is being extended across the Russian Empire. Tho territories of tlie United States, with un important exceptions, have remained undistur bed by the civil war, and tboy are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an ex pectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as States and bo con stitutionally admitted into the Federal Union. The immense material resources of these terri sibie. Every step in that "AretcmtrWraia nave a tendency to improve the revenues of the gov ernment and diminish the burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whe ther eome extraordinary measures to prornyf the end cannot be adopted. The mea-" which suggested itself as most likely to effective is a scientific exploration of mineral regions in these territories with a v ' uw t0 t ' lo - Pbhca- I t)o n of its results at home and in foreign conn tries, results which cannot fail to be auspicious. The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast expen ditures incident to the military and naval ope rations required for the suppression ot the re bellion, have hitherto been mot with a promp titude and certainty unusual in similar circum stance. I ®, and the public credit lias beon main tained. The continuance of the war, however, and tho increased disbursements made necessa ry by the augmented forces now in tho field, demand yonr lwst reflections as to tho best mode of providing the necessary revenuo without in jury to business, and with the least possible bur dens upon labor. Tho suspension ol specie payments by tho banks soon after the commence ment of your last session made large issues of United Stales notes unavoidable. In no other way' could the payment of the troops and the satisfaction of oillpr just demands Iw so econom ically or as well provide,-! lor. Tho judicious legislation of Congress securing f he reccivalidi ty of those notes for loans ur.d intern'? l duties, and making them a legal tender tor other do..' 3 has made them universal currency, and has sat isfied, partially at least, and for the time, the long felt want of a uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges. A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests, ehonld ever bo kept in view. Fluctuations in the vidua of currency arc al ways injurious, and to reduce these fluctuation# to the lowest possible point will always be a lending purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and cortain converti bility into coin, is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them, and it is extremely doubtful whether n circula tion of United States notes, payable in coin and sufficiently large for the wnnts of the peo ple can be permanently, usefully and safely main tained. Is there any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made, and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured? I know of none wliich promises so certain results, nnd at the same time so objectionable, as tho organization of banking associations under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To BuclTassociations the government might furnish circulating notes on tho security of L. States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes, prepared under tho supervision of proper offi cers, being uniform in appearance and security, and convertible always into coin, would at onco protect labor against tho evils of n vicious cur rency and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe oxebanges. A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the U. States for tho preparation and distribution of the notes, a general supervision of tho system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities. Freedom of Thtngfct and Opinion. BEDFORD, PA., FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 12, 1862. The public credit moreover would bo grcitly improved and the negotiation of new loans great ly facilitated by the steady market demand for governrnent bonds, which the adoption of the proposod system would create. It is an mjli tional recommendation of the measure of con siderable weight in my judgment that wo>ld reconcile, as far as possible, all existing infer i eats by the opportunity offered to existing intti- I tutions to reorganize under the act, substituting I ' only the secured uniform national circulation ■ for the local and various circulation, seemed and unsecured, now issued by thein. The receipts into the treasury from all sosr -1 ces, including loans, and balance troui the pre ceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the I ; 30thof June, 1832, were $.582,885,247 0.1,0f which sum $49,056,397 62 were derived frtm customs; $1,705,331 72 from the direct tax; from public lands, $152,203 77; from miscel laneous sources $931,786 64; from loans in all forms, $520,602,460 50. The remainder, $2.-' 527,065 80, was the balance from last year, j The disbursements during tbo samo period ( were: For Congressional, Executive and Judi- j cial purposes, $5,939,009 29; for foreign is- ; tcrcoursp, $ 1,339,710 35; for miscellaneons '• expenses, including the mints, loans, post office ; I deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other t like charges, $15,129,771 50; for expenses un-; dor the Interior Department, $3,102,985 Sfl; ' under the War Department, $391,368,407 Si; ! under the Navy Department, $42,674,569 (t); for interest on the debt, §13,190,324 45; apd for the payment of the public debt, including ; reimbursement of temporary loan and redemp tions, $96,090,922 69; making an aggregate of §570,841,700 25, and leaving a balance in ' the Treasury on the, Ist of July, 1802, of sl3,- ■ 043,540 81.

The amount expended in 1861, was , $13,600,759 11. For the last year the amount J has been rcduoed to $11,125,364 43, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the expendl-1 Uircs as compared with the preceding year, a-; bout $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year, 1861. The deficiency in the department! for the previous year was $4,551,966 98. For tlio last fiscal year it was reduced to $'2,112,-1 814 58. These favorable results are in part owing to tho ocv.ition of mail service in the in-, surreetionary states, and in part to a careful re view of the expenditures in that department, in the interest of economy. The efficiency of tho | postal service, it is believed, lias also been much | improved. The Postmaster General also opened a cor-1 fsoyndence, through the Department of State, with foreign governments, proposing a conven tion of postal representatives, for the purpose of simplifying th* rates of foreign postage, and to expedite ft.,' foreign mails. This proposition, I equally important, 1° otir adopted citizens and to the commercial iiitercs.'s of this country, has ] been favorably entertained anJ agreed to by all the governments from whom replit-3 have beoil J received. 1 ask the attention of Congress to i the suggestions of the Postmaster General, in his report, as to the further legislation required, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal sere j vie. Tho Secretary of the Interior reports as fob lows in regard to the public lands; The pub lic lands have ceased to be a source of j From the Ist of July, 1861, to the 30th of September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were $137,476 26, a sum much less than the expense of our land system du ring the same jieriod. The Homestead law, which will take effect en the Ist of January next, oft'ors such inducements to settlers that sales for cash cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to meet the expenso of the general land ) office, and the cost of surveying and bringing | land into market. The discrepancy bet ween tho j sum here stated as arising from tho sales of the public lands nnd the sum derived from the same source, as reported from the Treasury Depart ment, arises, as I understand, from tho fact that the periods of time, though apparently, were not really coincident at the beginning points, l the Treasury report including a considerable ; sum now which had previously been reported i from the Interior, sufficiently large as greatly to ' overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by tho Interior, and not by ' the Treasury. I The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, ' during the past year, manifested a spirit of in ■ subordination, and at several points have en gaged in opeu hostilities against the white set i tlements in that vicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country South of Kansas renounced their allegiance to the United States, and enter ed into treaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The Chief of the Cherokces visited this city, for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United States. lie alleges that they were constrained by superior force to enter into trea ties with the insurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required. In the month of August lat, the Sioux Indians, of Mimics iota, attacked the settlements in their vicinity, with extreme ferocity, killing indiscriminately men, women and children. This attack was wholly unexpected, and, therefore, no means lof defence had been provided. It is estimated j I that not loss than 899 persons were killed by j j the Indians, and large umount of property was ' i destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is J : not definitely known, and suspicions, which ; may be uujust, need not be stated. Infornia | tion was received from the Indian Bureau, from j different sources, about the time hostilities were , commenced, that a simultaneous attack was to i be made upon the white settlements by all the ' tribes between the Mississippi river and the Kocky mountains. The State of Minnessota | has suffered great injury from this Indian war. • A largo portion of her territory has been de j populated and a severe loss has been sustained by tho destruction of properly.

Webster to the ' Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Con- gross. I respectfully ask attention to it. Tocarry > out the provisions ot the act of Congress of t the 15th May last, I have caused the Depart- < ment of Arg'iculture of the United States to be £ organized. The Commissioner informs me that i within the period of a few months the Depart- < ment has established an cxtensivo system of < correspondence and exchanges, both at. home j and abroad, which promise to effect highly ben- > cficial results in the development of a correct i knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture, in the introductions of new products nnd in the collection of tho agricultural sntistics of tho 1 different States ; also that it will soon bo pre- 1 pared to distribute largely seeds, cereals, plants ( on-1 cuttings, and has already published and 1 liberally diffused much valuable iuformation, i in anticipation of a moro elaborate report, 1 which will in due time be furnished, embracing ) some valuable tests iffjehemioal science, now in progress in tho laboratory. Tbo creation of this Department was for the more immediate i bonefil of a large class of our most valuable fit- < izens, nnd I trust that the liberal basis upon i which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation, but that it will realizo, at no distant day, all the fondest anticipations of its ) | most sanguine friends, and become tho faithful source of advantage to all our people. On tho 22d day of September last, a procla- i rnntion wass issued by tho Executive, a copy of which is herewith submitted. In accordance with the purpose expressed in i the second paragraph of that paper, I now res ! peel fully recall your attention to what may be ! called "Compensated Emancipation." Ana ' tion may be said to consist ol its torritoi}, its j people and its laws. ' I The territory is the only part which is of cer tuiff durability. One pfiwwth AWAY* f And Another | generation coraetli, but the earth abideth forev er. It is of the first importance to duly consid !er and estimate this ever enduring part. That portion of the card's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the U. States i is well ndadted to be the home of one national ; family, and it is not well adapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of cli mate and productions are of advantage in the age for one people, whatever they might have been in former ages. Steam and telegraphs, in intelligence, have brought these to be an advan tageous combination for one united people. In the inaugural address I briefly pointed I out the total inadequacy of disunion as a reme ! Uy for differences between the people of the two | sections, I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which therefore, I beg to repeat: "One section of our country believes slavery to be right, aud ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the African ; i slave trade, are each us well enforced, perhaps, , as any law can over bo in a community where j the moral sense of tho people imperfectly sup- j t ports the law itself. The great body of the j I peoplo abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I , WHOLE NUMBER, 3034 - think, cannot be perfectly cared, and it would - be worse in both cases after the scparatt on of - the sections than before. The foreign slave r trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would bo i I ultimately revived without restriction in one -. section, while fugitive slaves, now only parti e ally surrendered, would not be surrendered at B all by the other. Physically speaking, we can s not separate; we can't remove our respective f sections from each other, nor build an impassi i b'e wall between them. A husband and wife > may be divorced, and go out of the presence ■ and beyond the reach of each other, but the I different parts of our country cannot do this, i They cannot but remain face to face, and inter i course cither amicable or hostile must contin ■ ue between them. Is it impossible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or ■ more satisfactory after separation than before? i Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can i make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully en , i forced between aliens than laws among friends ? i Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always, I and when, after much loss on both sides, and I no gain ou either, you cease fighting, tbo iden j tical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you. There is no line straight or crooked, suitable for a national bouudary upon which to divide. 1 race through, from East to West, upon the line between the free and slave country, and wc shall find little more than rivers easy to bo crossed and populated, or soon to bo populated thickly upon both sides, while nearly all its re remaining length or one-third of its length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk back and any consciousness of their presence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it ■ down on paper or parchment, ftfl a national j boundary. Tho fact of separation, if it comes, j gives up, on the part of sectional obligations : upon the seceding section, the fugitive slave clau ses, along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from—while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place. But there is another difficulty. The great interior region, bounded East by tho Allegbe nies, North by the British dominions, West by Rocky Mountains, South by the line along which the culture of cotton and corn meet", and which incltflfcs part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana Mich gan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, lo wa, Minnesota, and the territories of Dakotah, Nebraska, andpart of Colorado, have above ten millions of people, and will have fifty millions one thml ot tne country owneu uy Gtt&tsi ( States, certainly more than one million of square miles ; once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than seventy five millions of people. A glance at the map shows that, territorial speaking, it is the great WSdy of the Republic. The other parts are but mar ginal borders to it, tho magnificent region slop ing West from the Rocky Mountains to the Pa cific bring the deepest and also the richest in undevT'loped resources in the production of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them, this great interior region is natu rallv one of the most important in the world. Asccrtui n from tho statistics the small pro portion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and a large and rapid ly increasing amount of its products, and wc shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented; and yet this region lias no sea caost, touches no ocean anywhere. As part of one nation, its people now find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York, to South America and Africa, by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco. But separate onr common country into two nations, as designed by the present rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is hereby cut off from soino ono or more of these outlets, not perbnps by a physical barrier, but by embar rassing onerous trade regulations, and this is true wherever a dividing or boundary lino may be fixed. Place it between the now free nnd slave country, or place is South of Ken tucky, or North of Ohio, and still the truth re mains, that nono South of it can trade to any port North of it, and none North of it can trade to any port or placo South of it, except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them. Tho outlets East, West and South are indis pensable to the well being of the people inhab iting and to inhabit this vast interior region. Which of the threo may be the best is no prop er question. All aro butter than either and all of right belong to that people and to their suc cessors forever. True to thomselves, they will not- ask where a line of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there shall bo no such line. Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through Uicm to the great outside world.—They too and each of them must have access to this Egypt of the West, without paying toll at the crossing of a ny national boundary. Our national strife sprung not from our permanent part, not from the land we inhabit, not from our national homestead. There is no possible severing of this but would multiply, and not mitigate, evils among us. In all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands union and abhors separations. In fact, it would ere long force re-union, however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost. Our strife pertains to ourselves, to passing generations of men, and it cannot with out convulsion he hushed forever with the pas sing of one generation. In this view I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amend atory to the Constitution of the United States.

I beg indulgence to diaeuss ttte proposed arti cles at some length. Without slavery, the rebell ion could never have existed ; without slavery ir could not continue. Among the frienda of the O. nion there is great diversity of sentiment ant of policy in regard to slavery arid the African race a mongst us. Some would abolish it suddenly—anil'' without compensation, some would abolish it grad ually and with comper.s ition, tome would remove the Creed people from us, and some would retain them with us, and there are yet other minor divi sions. Because of these diversities we waste Much strength in struggles among ourselves, by Mutual I concessions we should harmonize and aet together. Thia would be a compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the Onion. These article* are .nterided to arobody a plan of such mutual con cessions. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assu med that the emancipation will follow, at least in "miUiwvwrr!

They will never see it. Another class will hail the prospect of eman cipation, but will deprgcate the loss of tiros'.— They will feci that it gives too little to the now willing slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where their numbers are very great, and it gives them the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves it to each State choosing to' act under it, to abolish slavery now or at the end of the century, or at nny other intermediate lime, or by degrees, extending over the whole or any pnrt of the period, and it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It also provides for compen-' sat ion and generally the mode of making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigata' the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpet ual slavery, nud especially of those who ore to receive the compensation. Doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive will object, yet the measure is both jußt and eco nomical. In a certain senso the liberation' of slaves is the destruction of property —property acquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any other property. It is no less true for having been so often said that the people of the South are not more responsible for the original introduction of this property than are the peo ple of the North, and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say tlmt the South has been inoro responsible than the North for its contin uance. If then, for a common object, the prop ertyisto be sacrificed, is it not just that it should he done at a common charge? And if with leas money or money more easily paid we can pre serve tho benefits of the Union by this means' than we can by tho war alone, is it not econom ical to do sot Let us consider it then. Let us ascertain the" sum l wo have expended in the war since the compensated emancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether if that measere ha<l been promptly accepted, by even some of the Slavo States, the same would have dono more to close the war than has been done oth erwise. If so, the measure would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and eco nomical measure. Certainly it is not w easy to pay something as to pay nothing, but it is easi er to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one. And it is easier to pay any sum when wo are able than it is tb pay it before we are:• ble. The law requires largo sums andmqubc# them at onoe. The aggregate sum nKasary for compensation of course would be huge, but but it would require no ready cash, nor tha bonds even, any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not and probably would nnt cloat before the end of the thirty-seven yoanr. At that time we shall probably haVe a hundred millions of people to share the burden instead of the thirty-one millions M now: Apd hot only so, but the incroase of our population may
