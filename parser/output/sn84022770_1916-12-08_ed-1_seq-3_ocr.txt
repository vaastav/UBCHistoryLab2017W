With the supreme court of the !United States now rests the settle jment of the greatest industrial strug gle the country has ever known. On lone side are arrayed four hundred I thousand employes of the great rail ! road systems. On the other side are j the powerful railroads themselves | backed by their enormous wealth. The fight is over the Adamson eight-hour law and it formally began before the supreme court this week. Both sides joined in asking the court to make a quick decision in the case. In the event of a delayed decision, however, the department of justice has agreed not to institute prosecu tions to enforce the law pending the supreme court's decision, and the railroads have agreed to keep their accounts on the eight-hour day basis pending the decision of the court. The eyes of the country are focused on the situation. For there is no doubt in the minds of those acquaint ed with the brotherhood leaders, that a refusal by the railroads to accept the provisions of the eight-hour law would result in a strike that would be truly a catastrophe. In August the brotherhood men were absolutely resolved to strike. Whether or not the passage of the Adamson law through congress was by arbitrary means, only its passage saved the United States from untold suffering, consequent upon a strike. The same sort of situation has arisen once more. No one who has talked with the blue-overalled em ployes doubts that the men will strike. The utterances in Baltimore the other day of the grim Warren S. Stone, grand chief of the Brother hood of Locomotive Engineers, of the strong W. G. Lee, head of the Broth erhood of United Trainmen; of the fiery little W. S. Carter, chief of the Locomotive Firemen, all foretold a determination to paralyze railroad traffic if the concessions of their men demanded were not granted. Labor Behind Brotherhoods. The speech of Andrew Furuseth demonstrated how unitedly organ ized labor stands behind the broth erhood members. Furuseth is the fighting Dane who laughed in the face of Pacific Coast shipping inter ests and jammed the seamen's ship ping bill through congress. It must be remembered that the men who comprise the brotherhoods are in no way anarchists. They are well above the average citizen in in telligence and in their daily scale of living. They are as a rule strong minded men who have thought out their problems for years. They are determined to obtain what they con sider their "rights." It does not matter whether the public considers these "rights" just. The brotherhood men do so. The situation is not theoretical. It is practical to the last degree. The brotherhood members are de termined to win. And they are free to admit that they will win, yea or nay. They do not counsel violence or disorder. But talk with one and he will invariably say, "It would be bard to tell what would happen in a strike. We might control our own members, but we could not control our sympathizers." Would Be Rough Affair. So it is generally conceded that in the event of a strike, not only would every wheel in the country cease to turn, not only would all the commod- Help Nature Do It Don't you see how she is working to get rid of your colds and catarrh?

COLUMBUS, OHIO ities of life be left stranded hard and fast, but there would be rioting, per haps dynamiting, perhaps ditched trains. There would be street fights, with beatings and shootings. Tho cities would be turned into armed camps with strikers and their sym pathizers arrayed against policemen and militiamen. From such a situa tion President Wilson saved tho country through the passage of the Adamson law last August, and the administration, it is not doubted, will find a way out of the situation that would be caused by a decision of the supreme court declaring the law illegal. But if the brotherhoods are deter mined to win, so are the railroads. Their costly legal talent and the presidents themselves have been in consultation for weeks. Many of these presidents have come out of the cab or from behind the firebox and are fully as straight to the point and practical as any brotherhood mem ber. With their short-cut logic has been mixed the technical information of the legal experts. So vital is the issue to the rail roads that the advisory committee of the railway executives has taken per sonal charge of their campaign. In their special committee are included nine of the most dominant figures In tho railway world. Men such as Hale Holden of the Burlington, Daniel Willard of the B. & 0., R. -S. Lovett of the Union Pacific, C. H. Markham of the Illinois Central, Fred Under wood of the Erie, Samuel Rea of the Pennsylvania, B. P. Elliott of the New Haven and A. H. Smith of the New York Central are in direct con trol. Their chief counsel is Alfred P. Thom, general counsel of the Southern Railway. Say Adamson Law Is Invalid. They are just as firmly convinced that the Adainson law is unconstitu tional as the brotherhoods are sure that it conforms with the provisions of that document. The railroad heads aay the law confiscates their property and that congress has no right what ever to fix wages and working hours. They declare they will fight to the last ditch. So do the brotherhoods. The brotherhood men have one powerful ally—the administration is at present "with" the workers. Pres ident Wilson has declared himself willing to aii the railroads, even to the point of granting them increased rates if the working of the Adamson law proves costly indeed. But the administration, through its legal de partment, is working side by side with the brotherhoods to sustain the Adamson law. Judge Adamson, after whom the law is named, and who was President Wilson's chief congression al aid in carrying out the legislation, is an avowed foe of the great traffic systems. He openly scoffs at the roads for asking higher rates. Opposes Railroads' Ideas. * In Adamson the railroads have one open foe not only in congress, but in the Newlandß hearings. He Is vice chairman of the committee conduct ing these hearings. Senator New landa of Nevada, chairman, favors federal incorporation of railroads, federal supervision of stock issuance, enlargement of the interstate com merce commission, centralizing con trol of the railways rather than ex tending the power of the state com missions. Adamson is opposed to these ideas. He believes that they infringe upon the principle of state's lights. The railroads indorse the ideas. They urge their adoption. They say, as it is now, they have "too many masters." Judge Adamson has said several times that no matter what legal steps —including injunctions—the rail roads attempt, the eight-hour law will certainly go into effect Janu ary 1. "It may be necessary for us to put some of these railroad presidents in jail," he said, quite seriously. From now on both sides will be at a tension until the supreme court hands down a decision. It Is not be lieved In Washington such a decision will be made perhaps before the first week of January. Nobody has ever hustled the supreme court. It sim ply isn't done. No matter what the emergency, the supreme court takes its dignified time.

CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE BEGINS RAILWAY INQUIRY Proposed by Presioent to Bet ter Condition ot Carriers. MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM Official! of Roads Prepared to Advocate Federal Incorporation, Supervision of Securities and Extension of Authority of Interstate Commerce Commission. Washington, Nov. 20.—Ten members of Congress, five Senators and fire members of the House of Representa tives, began here today an inquiry into the subject of pjibllc control and su pervision of railroads that may lead to the revolutionizing of the whole scheme of governmental regulation of the coun try's transportation lines. Incidentally the committee is to look Into the ques tion of government ownership of rail ways, telephone and telegraph lines and express companies. The members of the committee which will conduct this important In vestigation are Senator New lands of Nevada, chairman; Senators Robinson of Arkansas, Underwood of Alabama, Cummins of lowa and Brandegee of Connecticut, and Representatives Ad amson of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee, Cullop of Indiana. Esch of Wisconsin an.l Hamilton of Michigan. The In quiry was recommended by President Wilson in his message to Congress in December of last year. He described as its purpose to determine what could be done "for bettering the conditions under which the railroads are operated and for making them more useful serv ants of the country as a whole." Prominent Men as Witnesses. In order to obtain the views of all Interests affected by the operations of the transportation lines the committee has invited prominent shippers, bank ers, representatives of commercial or ganizations railway executives, econo mists and others to appear before them. The first to be heard are railroad commissioners of various states who began their evidence today. Their testimony Is directed chiefly to oppos ing any enlargement of the federal authority over commerce that would detract from the powers now exercised by state bodies. They will be followed shortly by ofHclals of railway labor organisations who are expected to reg ister their opposition to the Increase of governmental authority over wages and conditions of labor. Chief interest In the hearings cen ters in the proposals that will be put forward by representatives of the rail roads, for It is reported that they will advocate an extension of federal au thority over rates and securities to the practical exclusion of state control of these matters. It Is understood also that they will go on record In favor of fed eral Incorporation of all railroad lines. Legislative Program of Railroada. Prom an authoritative source la ob tained the following outline of the leg islative program which the railroads will ask the committee to consider in lt3 Investigation: They will endeavor to demonstrate to the commission that one of the principal defects in the prea ent system of railroad regulation la the lack of coordination resulting from the simultaneous and conflicting regu lation by the federal government and by the 48 states. They will, therefore, ask that entire governmental control of the rates and practices of interstate carriers, except purely local matters, be placed In the hands of a federal body so that Interstate traffic may be regulated without reference to state lines, lenvlng to the state commissions Jurisdiction only over local matters and local public utllitlea. As a part of this plan, a compulsory system of federal incorporation la to be recommended, accompanied by federal supervision of railroad stock and bond issues. A reorganisation of the Interstate Commerce Commission will be asked, in order to enable the commission prop erly to exercise Its Increased powers. It Is also proposed that the preparation and prosecution of cases against the railroads shall be delegated to some other agency of the government, possi bly the Department of Justice, so that the commission may devote its ener gies to Its administrative functions. With the commission thus relieved of some of Its present duties and equip ped to handle its business more prompt ly, the railroads will urge that the pe riod during which the commission may now suspend proposed increases in rates be reduced from ten months to 60 days, with provision for reparation to be paid to the shippers if the ad vance shall l>e declared unreasonable. They will also ask that the eomrnls sion be given the power to prescribe minimum as well as maximum rates so that In meeting complaints of ills crimination the commission may order the advance of a rate which It consid ers too low. One of the most important recom mendations for which the railroads will ask favorable consideration is tnat the commission be specifically authorized to take into account In rate regulation the effect of rates upon total earnings in the light of ex penses. While the Newlands Committee is required, under the resolution creat .in; it. to submit a report by January ticvt. It is not anticipated that the Ci*mniitt<u will have cotue anywhere ••ear ciui Uting its labors then.
