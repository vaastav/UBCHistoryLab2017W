With the message he trans mitted all the records and papers concerning the deal. The message in part says: "In view of the constant reiteration of the assertion that there was corrupt action on the part of the government in the acquisition of the Panama can al I deem it wise to submit to con gress all the Information I have con cerning the matter. The stories charging fraud in connection with this deal were first called to my at tention in the Indianapolis News The stories are scurrilous, libelous and false." Continuing in the message, the president says: "Delevan Smith of the Minneapolis News, shelters him self behind the fact that he accepted the statements of the World, and therefore the real offender is Pulitz er. A great injury has been done, name of the American people black ened, and it should not be left for a private citizen to sue Pulitzer, but tbe prosecution for libel should be commenced and carried on by the government.

BROWNSVILLE CAS E AGAIN Senator Foraker's Bill for Rein statement WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.—By vlr -1 tue of a postponement of the subject from May 13 last, consideration of the j Brownsville case will again be taken up by the state tomorrow. Senator Foraker, who Is pushing tbe bill for the reinstatement In the army of tbe negro troops discharged by President Roosevelt for participation in tbe Brownsville riot, believes that the measure will be passed at an early date. It will be recalled that the village of Brownsville, Tex., was "shot up" on tbe night of August 14, 1906. Re sponslbllty for the affray was at once charged to the colored aoldlers of the Twenty-fifth infantry, who were sta tioned at Fort Brown, adjoining tbe village. An Investigation by the offle era of the War Department failed to connect any particular soldier or sold lers with the shooting. It was then charged that the soldiers of Compan- j les B. C. and D bad "entered into a conspiracy of alienee" to protect their j guilty comrades. Accordingly an or der waa issued by the president to dlsmiss all tb soldiers of these three companies from the service, "without honor." The debates in tbe eenate were di rected mainly to a discussion of the president's powir In making this wholesale dismissal. The-e was some discussion, of course, as to whether. the soldiers were or were not guilty of tbe shooting, and It waa In one of tbeee cross-fires that Senators Spoon-' er and Tillman clashed in their bit- j ter controversy on tbe race question Late In January. 1907. a resolution was adopted directing tbe committee on Military Affaire to make an lave#- j tlg'tion Into the fact, connected with tbe shooting In the committee, ns on the senate floor. Senator Foraker of Ohio espoused tbe eaase of tbe colored men. Senator Warner of Missouri was chosen to see that the Administration Interests were pro teeted at tbe beering. For four months, with only n few Interruptions the committee held almost dally see-: sioae. In ail, 164 witaeaaea were mi untned. These witnesses included army officers, gun esparto, colored soldiers residents of j aBd i Brownsville, end others.

Before the committee HDd «»»»*•»• 'he aoldlers strenuous ly denied that they were guilty of the shooting, or that they had any know ledge as to who was responsible for the outrage. No witness waa able to Identify any particular soldier charg ed with being Involved In tbe affrny. A majority of the members of the committee were convinced thnt tbe shooting was the work of the soldiers, and that the president was within bis constitutional rights In ordering the dismissal of the three companies. On May 13 iaat the measure for re instatement of the colored soldiers came up in the senate. Senator For aker, tbe champion of the negroes, moved for a postponement of the vote until December. After the motion by Senator Culberson, of Texas, to vote on tbe bill Immediately had been told on the table, Mr. Foraker's motion waa adopted by a vote of 62 to 8. Tbe Ohio senator considered this n victory and gave out n statement In which he said that while he bad not passed the bill et that time, he be leived that Its passage waa Insured by the postponement, There to nothing to indicate thnt Senator Foraker has abated bto ta ter eat In the cause of the discharged men. He to not that kind of a man who quits In the middle of a fight, There have bees frequent reports -that be ban "something up hit sleeve" to who to responsible for the shoot ing. This may sot be no. but those wbo are familiar with the tactiee and temperament of the Ohioan feel oer tain the session will be enlivened by a continuation of the fight for the "Black Battalion."
