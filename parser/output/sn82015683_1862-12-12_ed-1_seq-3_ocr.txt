A very Important hibei corpu cae was argued jenterday before the full bench of the Sujreme Court, and their de i.-ion upon it will te had to dar. A man n uned (feore O'Mallct wa aire-teii a9 a fugi live from jutice on the demand of the Governor of Pennsylvania, i harge! with leing et.eaged in n robtery at Pdtburg, on ihe 2Cth day of Novem ber 1 it. Many perion here were willing to nweir poitively tint O'Malley wa in the citv of Indian ipoli on" that and the ueeeeding day. The i-.;!et lawyer at the bar were retained on both ,.ide-bv O'Malley and by the officers from Penn Ivani i wlio caine here for the pi isoner. A wtit of h il.c i corpu was obtained from the Su preme Court, and j e-terday the cae wa very ably argueil by Hm. 1 ho ma A. Hendricka for the prisoner, and Hon. Jo-enh K. McDonald for the accusing partiei. The question of the pow er nnd juridictior. of the Court was very fully dicQ-ed, hut the oiiits submitted, and upon which the cae will probably be decided, was the Miflicii-riey of ihe pipers. Mr. MrD inald eontendc! that the case was only a f ttper cte, atid the (Viurt had no power to go behind the document upon which the Kiecn tive had acte 1. Mr Hendricks alleged that the papers were in-snf?ii.-ient. The adidivit upon wh'uh they weie ba-ed did not charge any distinct offense. He ulo contended that the Court was competent to examine thefit whether or not the prisoner w as I a fugitive ftoin ju-ttre und the ju-dice that pur suel n p irticular ollen.-e. If this could not be examined here, where could it be eiamined? Not nt Pitt -burg, where the man would be put upon his trial for the cttme without a question us to his being a fugitive being raited. 1 he Court at a late hour named 1 o'clock to dav for tlie further eoniIeration of ihe case. The ijue-lion of biil then came tip, nnd the Court, without the examination of nuthoritie. refu.-ed to t ke bail, and remanded the prisoner to the cu-Unly of the SherifT, with an mtim ition to th it oflu-er tint he could be kept without being locked up.

At 5 this morning the rends tired two eignal guns, and timing ihe latter putt of the night rockets were Ire-piently seen within their lines. At 5 o'clock the construction of three bridges in front ol the city was commenced. When the biio'ges were alout hilf completed, tho enemy opened a munleum fire of inlantiy from ihe hou.-es on the river bank. Up t this time not a shot hid been fiied fiom ourf'uie.

The indications are that a battle will be fought to-morrow. t U. li II I.NM A I. AVasiii.ngtox, December 11. Sexatk Messrs. Hale and Sumner pie sented petition protesting against the action of tlie Adrisory Hoard of the Navy. Meters King, 1'omeroy and Howard presented petitions in favor ot a genera! bankrupt act. Mr. Rrowtiii g iuttoduced a bill to amend the act establishing the Territorial Government of Utah, and to facilitate the administration of jus tice iu said Territory. Referred to the Judiciary Committee. A me-s age wa received faotn the President recommending a vote of thanks to Lieut. G. V. Morris, for the determined valor and heroi-m he displayed in defense of the loop of-war Cumber land against the rebel in n clad Mernmac. Also recommending a vole of thanks to Lieut. 0. L Worden, lor ihe skill and gallantry exhibited by Iii in in tlie battle betw een the Monitor and the rebel steamer Meniniic. Referred lo the Naval Committee. A communication was also received from the President answering a tesolution of the Senate calling for information and evidence relative to the Indian barbarities in Minnesota. Ordered to be primed. The resolution relative to the arbitrary arrests of crt tin citizens of Delaware was taken up. Mr. Morrill contended that the resolution, as it now stood, was not a resolution of inquiry, but a charge a;uin-t ihe Govemmentand an indictment against the President, and he hhould vote for no such resolution. He claimed that in this state of war and rebellion, with the hind full of traitors and spies the Commander-in-Chief has the tij;ht to arrest stich men. No one, not even the Senator from Delaware, (Saul-bury) has claimed that the.-e men were loval. That Senator (Powell) had denounced tiie Government from the beginning, thcsime as his colleague, who followed the I gloal result of his reasoning and went into the lebel army bu' not a single word does the Senator (Powell) oiler against the rebels, and rejoices ov er tho le cent elections, and saya the lion hearted Democ racy nre rebuking tliis Administration. Well, every rebel throughout rebeldom rejoices iu the same way. It is 6iiposel there will be n peace party at the Nc-ith that will force this Gov ernment into an ingloiiou. peace, and that party encour aged Jeff. Davis and foreign countries In their tu hemes of intervention. There ought to be some proof that these men were loyal. Mr. Morrill contended that there was no ground for comp!. tint that men were arrested on suspicion. Men were always arrested upon suspicion of crime. Mr. Weight moved to amend, the resolution so as lo make the call noon the President instead of the Secretary of War. Mr. Wright said he knew no in.m w ho w is per mitted to live iu the South w ho ha any sympathy with the North. He would hvve to se3 some of the spirit ehow n by Stotiewtll Jackson when he fonnd fotty sev en of his men skedaddling ftoin the battle. He m irehed them in front of the regiment and had every in in of them shot. In stead ol this, we have propositions for conven tions, kr. He wot. Id htand by ihe Government and ihe President. Ho would have the ttower of the Government felt by every traibir North an J South. Mr. Riyard argued at length to show the a flairs id the S:ate of Delaware, and that true loyalty to the country did not imply loyalty to a single individn i. Mr. Powell said the President had violated the Constitution, nnd he was reidy to prove it. He did not believe thi Union could ever he rcstoied by force of arm. He contended that President Lincoln had violated the Constitution iu enlarg ing the regular army, iu the suspension of tho writ of habe is corpus, iu arresting citizens, in interfering with the freedom of the prc.-s, and iu his recent proclamation. Mr. Fessendcii was willing to admit that some thing had been done apparently without liw; but does any oie doubt the patriotism of the Presi dent? doe? any one pretend thtt he h is not done what lie thought btvt to suppress this rebellion and preserve the country, or tint he Ins wilfully viol tied the rights of any citizen? At 1 o'clock A. M. the Senate hail not ad journed. Hois.;- Mr Roseoe Conklin asked leive to re j)i t a bill to establish a uniform system of batik tuple Mr. Ye.it-ne:i otTered the following, to be laid over for Inline consideration: llrsolrcd by the House of Representatives, the Sen ate, concurring, That the proclatn itiori of the President, of the 22d of September, ltGi, is not warranted by the Constitution littnlrid, That notice of cm tricipation, a in dic itel iu the prod mi it'"n as well calculate! to hasten the restoration of peice, is not well chosen as a measure, and is an assumption of power dan gerous to the lights of cit'zen and the perpetuity of a free Government. Mr. Lovcjov moved to lay the resolution on the t tble. Carried, by 94 against 15. Tho House then went into Cmnnittee of the Whole on ihe President's message. Mr. Hutchins spoke at length, taking for a text lliat freedom and slavery weie incompatible be yond hope of reconsideration or compromise. Mr. Menies. replying, said he was in the habit of regarding ihe enemies of the pioclamation as the friends of the Constitution. He understood the genllem m from Ohio (Mr. Hutchin) to be opposed U the Union as it w.i. No doubt the reason i i-nel by him for the recent defeat of tha Republicans were satisfactory to the gentle man hiui-e'l, but he ineie'y would tell them that the iiMstcrs to that party were attributable to the Abolition programme of the Paesident aud his puty.
