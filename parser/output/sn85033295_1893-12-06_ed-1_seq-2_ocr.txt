%\xt |{qntl)lkai(* f • WATERTOWN, WIS. ORDERED 10 HONOLULU. The Cutter Ccnvin Gone to Hawaii on a Se cret Mission. San Francisco, Cal., Dec. 4. — The Cnited States revenue cutter Thomas Corwin is under special orders for a 2,500 mile trip. Her destination is Honolulu without doubt and slie may be expected to leave this afternoon or to-morrow morning. Whether any person in diplomatic authority is coining here from Washington to go to the islands on the Corwin is not known. It is quite likely, however, that a special messenger entrusted with secrets of state will be the emissary who will occupy one of the staterooms already set apart in the after cabin. The greatest secrecy has been maintained since the special orders ar rived Saturday noon. These turned the cutter over to the State Department and placed her under waiting orders. In structions were also given to prepare for a 2,500 mile voyage and to be ready to sail in forty-eight hours. A heavy supply of coal has been stowed away on the Corwin’s decks in addition to that in the bunkers. Washington, D. C.,Dec. 4. —Secretary Gresham declined to sav anything this morning in regard to the report that the revenue cutter Thomas Corwin was to carry a message on behalf of the State Department from San Fran cisco to Honolulu. There is reason to suppose, however, that the story is substantially correct. Secretary Gresham was busy with dispatches dur ing the latter part of yesterday which are to go on the Corwin. As to what these contain nothing can be learned. Secretary Gresham has been very em phatic in his assertion at different times that Minister Willis had received no further instructions since his departure from this country and that he needed none. This gives rise to the surmise that a dispatch bo urgent as to require a special messenger at this time can only be caused by a change in the policy intended to be pursued. SOLDIERS’ HOME EXPENSES. Estimate of the Cost of Maintaining ths institution Next Yean. Washington, D. C., Dec. 4. —Esti- mates of the secretary of the treasury of appropriations required for the Na tional Soldiers’ Home at Milwaukee were submitted to Congress to-day as follows: Current expenses, $27,699.90; subsistence $127,750; clothing, $35,000; households, $51,952; hospital, $27,350.85; transportation, $2,000; construction and repairs, $25,400; building for central boil er plant,inel tiding coal sheds and smoke stacks, putting boiler in place and water heater, $27,300; tunnel for connecting with main building, hospital and bar racks, including excavation, $7,200; farm, $10,000; total, $351,652.75. me secretary also submits estimates of $7,500 fora pier light at South Milwau kee, SIO,OOO for a shoal light and fog sig nal at Peshtigo,;ss,ooo for a light station at Bayfield, $5,500 for a light station at Manitowoc, $20,000 for a light station at Sturgeon Bay, SIO,OOO for a point light and log signal in Chequamegon Bay, $20,000 fora iigiit and fog signal station on Devil’s Island, and $21,070 for the support and maintenance of the Indian school at Tomah. NOT WHAT IS NEEDED. Project of Removing the Wisconsin Building to Milwaukee Abandoned. Christian Wahl, when asked this after noon with regard to the progress made toward removing the Wisconsin World’s Fair building to this city and placing it in one of the public parks, said that after a careful investigation of the matter he had about concluded that it would hardly be desirable to remove the structure to Milwaukee lor the reason that its general style would not he adaptable to the wants of the parks. The ground floor could be readily utilized, but the upper story and attic would be useless. The cost of transportation, Mr. Wahl says, Avouldbe sufficient to erect a structure suitable to the wants of the board. His project for the transfer of the fair building was suggested by a feeling of sentiment. There is no ready cash on hand at present, and the entire plans may be dropped for the winter. • DR. MEYER ON TRIAL He and His Wife Accused of Several Mur- d c P3. New York, Dec. 4. — After months of waiting Dr. Henry E. Meyer, the al leged murderer, was placed on trial for his life this morning, together with his wife, whom the prosecution claim was a guilty party to her husband’s crimes. The case is being heard by Justice Bar rett in oyer and terminer. Long before the customary hour for opening the balls leading to the court-room were blocked with a dense, struggling mass of people, eager to be present at the opening of the trial. 

PERE HYACINTHE’S NEW CHURCH. Union of Catholics and Protestants in Religious Work. Paris, Dec. 4. —Pere ilyacinthe, in his advent sermon in the Protestant chapel in the RueTaitbout yesterday, explained the objects of the new religious .-oetiety composed ot Catholics and Proiesbmts called the National Society of Evan gelization and founded by himself and Pastor Mattetal, ex-president of the consistory of the Lutheran Church. Pere Ilyacinthe said skepticism arose from the formalism and iuclusivism in the routine of the various Christian churches. He appealed for a union of Catholics and Protestants as realizing th* idea of the new church and em bracing all those known as Christians. STUMBLED ON A ROBBERS’ RESORT. l>uluth Police Make What They Relieve to He Important Arrests. Duluth, Minn., Dec. 4. —James and Robert Rowe were arrested here yes terday on a charge of stealing. To-day detectives found their house well filled with spoils of all sorts. The arrest is believed to be a very important one. TALKS TO CONGRESS President Cleveland Submits His Message at the Opening of the Session. SOME HINTS ON LEGISLATION. Immediate Action on the Tariff Bill Urged—Economy in Public Matters— Civil-Seryice lieform—The Hawaiian Onestion. Washington, D. C.. Pec. 4. — Follow ing is President Cleveland’s message to Congress: To the Congress of the United States; The constitutional duty which requires the Presi dent from time to'time to give to the Congress information of the state of the union and rec ommend to their consideration such action as he shall judge necessary, is fittingly entered upon by commending to the Congress a careful examination of the detailed statements and well supported recommendations contained in the reports of the heads of departments who are chielly charged with the executive work of the government. In an effort to abridge this com munication as much as is consistent with its purpose, I shall supplement a brief reference to the contents of departmental reports by the mention of such executive business and inci dents as are not embraced therein and by such recommendations as appear to be at this partic ular time appropriate. 

RELATIONS WITH OTHER POWERS. Adjustment f the Oift'eronces with Chili —The Brazilian Itevult. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been free from per plexity, no embarrassing situations that will not yield to a spirit of fairness and love of justice which joined with consistent firmness character ize a truly American foreign policy. My predecessor having accepted the office of the arbitrator of the long standing missions boundary dispute, tendered to the President by the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned by those states to lay before me evidence and arguments in behalf of their respective governments. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the re public of Brazil found the United Stales ready to watch the interests of our citi zens in that country, with which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our own new navy are now and for some time have been stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle being between the estab lished government which controls the machin ery of administration and w ith which we main tain friendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their com mand in an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking us it does the element of divided administration, 1 have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim recognition as belligerents. Thus lar the posi tion of our government has been that of an at tentive but impartial observer ot the unfortun ate conflict, emphasizing our fixed policy of im partial neutrality in such a condition of affairs ns now exists. I deemed it necessary to disavow in a manner not to be misunderstood the unau thorized action of our late navy commander in these waters in saluting the revolted Brazilian admiral, being indisposed to countenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to the local insurrection. The eon veutiou between our go\ eminent and Chili, having for its object the settlement and adjustment of the demands of the two countries against each other, has been made effective by the organization of the claims commission pro vided for. The two governments failing to agree upon the third member of the commission, the good ofiiees of the president of the Swiss Republic w ere invoked as provided in the treaty, and the selection of the Swiss representative in this country to complete the organization was gratifying to the United States ami Chili. The vexatious question of so-called lega tion asylum for offenders against the state and its laws was presented anew in Chili by the unauthorized action of the late United Stales minister in harboring in his official residence two persons who had failed in an at tempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges w ere pending, growing out of a former abortive disturbance. The doctrine of asylum as applied to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedents, and when allowed, tends to en courage sedition and strife. Under no circum stances can the representatives of this govern ment be permitted under the ill-defined fiction of extra,territoriality, to interrupt the adminis tration of criminal justice in the countries to which they are accredited. A temporal de mand having been made by the Chilian govern ment for the correction of this conduct in the instance mentioned, the minister w as instructed no longer to harbor the offensive persons. THE 

GEARY CHINESE LAW. Amended Measure Believed to Be Ap proved by Chinese Laborers. The legislation of last year known as the Geary law requiring the registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the United states and the deportation ot all not complying w ith the provisions of the act w ithin the time prescribed, met with much opposition from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon the advice of eminent counsel that the law was unconstitutional, the great mass of Chinese laborers, pending judicial inquire as to its validity, in good faith declined to apply for the certificates required by its pro visions. A test upon proceeding by habeas cor pus was brought before the supreme court, and on May 15, 181)3, a decision was made by that tribunal sustaining the law. It is believed that under the recent amendment of the act extend ing the time for registration, the Chinese labor ers thereto entitled who desire to reside in this country will now avail themselves of the re newed privilege thus afforded of establishing by lawful proceedure their right to remain, and that thereby the necessity of enforced deporta tion may b 6 to a great degree avoided. It has devolved upon the United States minis ter at Pekin, as dean of the diplomatic body, and in the absence of a representative of Swe den and Norway, to press upon the Chinese gov ernment reparation for the recent murder of Swedish missionaries at Sung Pu. This ques tion is of vital interest to all countries whose citizens engage in missionary work in the in terior. By article 13, of the general act of Brussels signed July ‘2, 1890, for the suppression of the slave trade and the restriction of certain injuri ous commerce in the Independent States of the Congo and in the adjacent zone of Central Africa, the United States and the other signatory powers agreed to adopt appropriate means for the punishment of persons selling arms and ammunition to the natives and for the confisca tion of the prohibited articles. It being the plain duty of this government toaid in suppress ing the nefarious traffic, impairing as it does the praiseworthy and civilizing efforts now' in prog ress in that region, I recommend that an act be passed prohibiting the sale of arms and intoxi cants to natives in the regulated zone by our citizens. Costa Rica has lately testified its friendliness by surrendering to the United States in the ab sence of a convention of extradition but upon duly submitted evidence of criminality, a noted fugitive from justice. It is trusted that the ne gotiation of a treaty with that country to meet recurring eases of tins kind will soon be accom plished. In my opinion treaties for reciprocal extradition should be concluded with all those countries with which the United States has not already conventional arrangements of that char acter. 1 have doomed it fitting to express to the gov ernment ot Costa Rica and Columbia the kindly desire of the United states to see their pending boundary dispute finally closed by arbitration in conformity with the spirit of the treaty con cluded between them some years ago. Our relations with the French republic con tinue to be intimate and cordial. 1 sincerely hope that the extradition treaty with that coun try as amended by the Senate will soon be oper ative. While occasional questions affecting our natu ralized citizens returning to the land of their birth have arisen in our intercourse with tier many. our relations with that country continue satisfactory. The questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress be tween the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the award and i eg (Rations agreed upon by the Behring Sea tri i unal of arbitration practically effective, and ii i.s not doubted that Great Britain will co-operate freely with lid- country lor the accomplishment of that purpose. The dispute glowing out of tiie discriminating lolls imposed in the Welland Canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States, Avas adjusted by the substitution of a more equitable schedule of charges, and my predecessor thereupon sus pended his proclamation imposing discriminat ing tolls upon British vessels in transit through our canals. A request for additions to the list of extraditable offenses covered by the existing treaty betAveen the two countries, is under con sideration. During the past year an American citizen, em ployed in a subordinate commercial position in Ilayti, after suffering a protracted imprisonment on an unfounded charge of smuggling, Avas fin ally liberated on judicial examination upon urgent representation to the Haytian govern mont. A suitable indemnity Avas paid to the sufferer. By a law of Ilayti a sailing vessel having dis charged her cargo is refused clearance until the duties on such cargo have been paid. The hardship of this measure upon American ship OAvners who conduct the bulk of the carrying trade of that country has been insisted on with a view of securing the removal of this cause of complaint. Upon receiving authentic information of (he firing upon an American mail steamer touching at the port of Amapala, because her captain re fused to deliver up a passenger in transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon demand of the military authorities of Honduras, our minister to that country under instructions protested against the wanton act and demanded satisfac tion. fi’he government of Ilonduias, actuated by a sense of justice and in a spirit of the ut most friendship, promptly disavoAved tbe illegal conduct of its officers and expressed sincere re gret for the occurrence. It is confidently anticipated that a satisfactory adjustment will soon be reached of the questions arising out of the seizure and use of American A’essels by insurgents in Honduras and the sub sequent denial by the successful government of commercial privileges to those vessels on that account. A notable port, the southeasterly coast of Li beria between the Cavally and Ban Pedro rivers, which for nearly half a century has been gen erally recognized as belonging to that republic by cession and purchases, lias been claimed to be under the protectorate of France in virtue of agreements entered into by the native tribes over Avhom Liberia's control lias not been avcll maintained. More recently negotiation between the Liberian representative and the French government resulted in (he signature at Paris of a treaty whereby us adjusted certain Liberian territory is credited to France. This convention, at last advices, had not been ratified by the Liberian legislature and executive. Feeling a sympathetic interest in the fortunes of the little commonwealth, the establishment and development of which Avere largely aided by the benevolence of our countrymen and which con stitutes the only independently sovereign state on the west coast of Africa, this govern ment has suggested to the French government its earnest concern lest territorial impairment in Liberia should take place without her uncon strained consent. Out relations Avitli Mexico continue to be of the closest and friendly nature w hich should always characterize the intercourse of two neighboring republics. The work of re-locating the monuments marking the boundaries be tAveen the countries from Paso del Norte to the Pacific is now nearly completed. The commis sion recently organized under the conventions of 1884 aud 1889 it is expected will speedily set tle disputes growing out of the shifting current of the Kio Grande River east of El Paso. Nicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, tlie party at first successful having in turn been displaced by another. Our newly appointed minister, by bis timely good offices, aided in a peaceful adjustment of the contro versy involved in the first conflict, fi’he large American interests established in that country in connection Avith the Nicaragua t'anal Avere not molested, fi’he canal company Iras unfor tunately become financially seriously embar rassed. but a generous treatment has been ex tended to it by the government of Nicaragua. The United States are especially interested in the .successful achievement of the vast under taking this company has in charge. That it should be accomplished under distinctively American auspices and its enjoyment assured not only to the A esselsof this country as a chan nel of commercial communication between our Atlantic and Pacific seaboards, but to the ships of the Avorld in the interests of civilization, is a proposition Avhich in my judgment docs not ad mit of question. Guatemala has also been visited by the. politi cal vicissitudes which have afflicted her Cen tral American neighbors; but (he dissolution of its legislature and the proclamation of a dicta torship have been unattended with civil war. An extradition treaty a\ ill Norway has re cently been exchanged and proclaimed. The extradition treaty A\ith Russia, signed in March, 1887, and amended and confirmed by the Senate in February lust avus duly proclaimed last June. HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS DISCUSSED. The President Explains the Action Taken Regarding the Oueen, It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our relations Avith Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment. Just prior to the installation ot the present administration the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated betAveen the provisional gov ernment of the islands and the United States and submitted to the Senate for ratification. This treaty 1 Avithdrew for examination and dis patched Hon. James H. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner to make an impartial investigation of tire circumstances at tending the change of government and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After ame rough and exhaustive exam ination Mr. Blount submitted to me his report, showing beyond all question that the constitu tional government of Hawaii had been subvert ed Avith the active aid of our representative to that government and through the intimidation caused by the presence of ari armed naval force of tbe United States, Avhich avus landed for that put pose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course of our goA ernmeat to pursue Avas to undo the Avrong that had been done by those representing ns and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accomplishing this result Avithin the constitutional limits of executiA'C power,ami rec ognizing all our obligations and responsibili ties growing out of any changed condition brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister to Honolulu has received appropriate instruction to that end. Thus far no information of the accomplish ment of definite results has been re ceived from him. Additional advices are soon expected, and Avhen received they Avill be promptly sent to the Congress, together Avith all other information at hand, accompa nied by a special executive message fully de tailing all the facts necessary to a complete un derstanding of the case, and* presenting a his tory of all the material events leading up to the present situation. By a concurrent resolution passed by the Sen ate February 14, 1890, and by the House of Rcp resentatives on the 3d of April following, the President Avas requested to enter into, from time to time as fit occasion may arise, negotiations Avith any government Avith Avhich the United States has or may huA - e diplomatic relations, to the end that “any differences or disputes arising betAveen the tAvo governments Avhich cannot be adjusted by diplomatic agency may be referred to arbitration and be peaceably adjusted by such means.” April 18, 1890, the international American conference of Washington, by res olution, expressed the Avish that all controversies betAveen the republics of America and the nations of Europe might be settled by arbitration and recommended that the govern ment of each nation represented in that confer ence should communicate this Avish to all friend y powers. A favorable response has beerf re vived from Great Britain in the shape of a rcso i ntion adopted by parliament July 16 last, cor •daliy sympathizing Avith the purpose in view and expressing the hope that Her Majesty’s government av i ll lend ready co-operation to the government of the United States upon the basis of the concurrent resolution aboA’e quoted. It affords me signal pleasure to lay this parlia mentary resolution before the Congress and to express my gratification that the sentiment of two great and kindred nations is thus authori tatively manifested in favor of the rational and peaceable settlement of international quarrels by honorable resort to arbitration. Since the passage of the act of March 3, 1893, authorizing the President to raise the grade of our envoys to correspond Avith the rank in Avhich foreign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany haA’e conferred upon their representatives at this capital the title ot ambassador and I haA - e re sponded by accrediting the agents of the United states in those countries with the same title. A like elevation of mission is announced by Russia and Avhen made Avill be similarily met Avith. fi’his step fittingly compares Avith the position the United States holds in the family of nations. During my former administration I took oc casion to recommend a re-cast of the laws relat ing to the consular service in order that it might become a more efficient agency in the promotion of the interest it was intended to subserve. The duties and poAvers of consuls have been ex panded Avith the giOAving requirements of our foreign trade. Discharging important duties affecting our commerce and American citizens abroad, and in certain countries exercising ju dical functions, these officers should be men of character, intelligence and ability. Upon proof that the legislation of Denmark s cures copyrights to American citizens on equal looting w ith its own, the privileges of our copyright laws haAe been extended by procla mation to subjects of that country.

On the same date there as in the treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,657,273 and s'ilver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $126,261,553. The purchases of silver under the law of July 14, 1890, during the last fiscal year aggregated 54,008,162.59 tine ounces, which cost $45,531,- 374.63. The total amount of silver purchased from the time mat law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause on the Ist day ot November. 1893, was 168,674,590,4(> line ounces, which cost $155,930,940.84. Between the Ist day of March, 1873, and the Ist day of No vember, 1893, the government purchased under all laws 603,003,717 tine ounces of silver at a cost of $516,622,948.

SILVER PURCHASE REPEAL. Probable Effect of the Action at the Extra Session of Congress. The recent repeal of the provision of larv re- I quirlng the purchase ot silver bullion by the ! government as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs, and 1 do not doubt that the ultimate result of (his action w ill be most salrt- ' tary and far reaching. In the nature of things. howcvcr.it is impossible to know at this time | precisely what conditions will be brought about by the change, or what, if any, supple- | mentary legislation may in the light of such j conditions appear to be essential or expedient, i Ot course alter the recent financial perturbation. ! time is necessary for the re-establishment of | business confidence. When, however, through j this restored confidence the money which | has has been frightened into hoarding places i is returned to trade and enterprise, a | survey of the situation will probably dis- 1 close a safe path leading to a per- , manontly sound currency, abundantly sulti- j cient to meet every requirement of our increas ing population and business. In the pursuit of I this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, determined to be content with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these 1 circumstances 1 am convinced that a reasonable j delay in dealing with this subject instead of be- i ing injurious will increase the probability of I wise action. The monetary conference which i assembled at Brussels upon our invitation I was adjourned to the 30th day of November in i the present year. The considerations just stated I and the fact that a definite proposition from us I seemed to be expected upon the reassembling of j the conference, led me to express a willingness I to have the meeting still further postponed, it 1 seems to me that it would be wise to give gen eral authority to the President to invite other nations to such a conference at any time when there should boa fair prospect of accomplishing an international agreement on the subject of coinage. I desire also to earnestly suggest the wisdom of amending tin* existing statutes in regard to the issuance of government bonds. The au thority now invested in the secretary of the treasury to issue bonds is not so clear as it should be. and the bonds authorized are disad vantageous to the government, both as to the time of their maturity and rate of interest. The superintendent of immigration, through the secretary of the treasury, reports that dur ing the lust fiscal year there arrived at our ports 440,793 immigrants. Of these 1.063 were not permitted to land under the limitations of the law. and 577 were returned to the countries irom w hich they came by reason of their having become public charges. ‘The total arrivals were 141,034 less than for the previous year. The secretary in his report gives an account of the operation of the marine hospital service and of the good work done under its supervision in preventing the entrance and spread of con tagious diseases. The admonitions of the lust two years touching our public health and tbe demonstrated danger of the introduction of contagious diseases from foreign ports has in vested the subject of national quarantine with increased interest. A more general and har monious system tbflu now exists, acting prompt ly and directly everywhere and constantly operating by preventive means to shield our country from the invasion of disease and at the same time having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would, I believe, add greatly to the safety of our people. 

FACTS ABOUT PENSIONS. Estimate of the Sum Required for the Next Fiscal Year. The secretary of the interior has the super vision of so many important subjects that his report is of especial value aud interest. On the 30th day of June. 1893. there were on the pension rolls 966,012 names, an increase of 39,944 over the number on tbe rolls June 30, 1892, Of these there were 17 widows and daughters of revolu tionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518 sur vivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3,882 suivivors and widows of Indian Avars, 284 army nurses, and 475,645 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the Avar of the re bellion. The latter number represents those pensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from army and navy service. The number of persons remaining oh the rolls June 30, 1893, avlio vvere pensioned under the act of June 27. 1890. Avhich allows pensions on ac count of death and disabilities not chargeable to army service, Avas 4,591,565. The number added to the rolls during the year Avas 123,634, and the number dropped Avas 33.690. The first payments on pensions alloAved during the year amounted t 0533,576,549.98. This includes arrears or the accumulation betAveen the time from which the allowance of pension dates and the time of actually granting the certificate. Although the I&av of 1890 permits pensions for disabilities not related to military service, yet as a requisite to its benefit a disability must exist incapacitating applicants ‘•from the perform ance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support.” fi'he execution of this law in its early stages does not seem to have been in accord with iis true intention; but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construction was given to the statute and since that time this construction has been followed. This has had the effect of limiting the operation of the law to its intended purpose. The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of Avholesale and gi gantic frauds, the commissioner suspended pay ments upon a number of pensions which seem to be fraudulent or unauthorized, pend ing a complete examination, and gave no tice to the pensioners in order that they might have an opportunity to establish, if possi ble, the justice of their claims notwithstanding the apparent invalidity. This. I understand, is the practice which has fora long time prevailed in the pension bureau; but after entering upon those recent investigations the commissioner modified this rule so as not to alloAv until after complete examination interference Avfith the payment of a pension apparently not altogether void but which merely bad been fixed at a rate higher than that authorized by law. lam unable to understand Avhy frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thor oughness and vigor. Every name fraudu lently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiment in Avhich pensions have their origin: every fraudulent pensioner has become a bad citizen; every false oath in support of a jtension has made perjury more common, and false and un deserving pensioners rob the people not only of their money but of the patriotic sentiment which the survivors of a Avar Avho fought for the pres ervation of the Union, ought to inspire. Thou sands of neighborhoods have their vvell-knoAvn fraudulent pensioners, and recent developments by the bureau establish appalling conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds. By no means the least Avrong done is to brave and deserving pen sioners, Avho certainly ought not o be con demned to such association. Those Avho at tempt in the line of duty to rectify these Avrongs should not be accused of enmity or indifference to the claims of honest A cterans. The sum expended on account of pensions for the year ending June 30, 1893. Avas $156,740,- 467.14. The commissioner estimates that $165,- 000,000 Avill be required to pay pensions during the year ending January 30, 1894. CIVIL-SERVICE REFORM. Successful Operation of the Luavs Rela tive to Office Now in Force. fi’he continued intelligent execution of the civil-service law and the increasing approval by the people of its operation are most gratify ing. fi'he recent extension of its limitations and regulations to (ho employes at free delivery post-offices, which has been honestly and promptly accomplished by the commission with the hearty co-operation of the postmaster-gen oral, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system. lam if possible more than ever convinced of the incalculable benefits conferred by the civil-serAice law, not only in its effects upon the public service but also what is even more important—in its ef fect in elevating the tone of political life gener ally. fi'he course of civil-service reform in this country interestingly illustrates hoAv strong a hold a movement gains upon our people which has underlying It a sentiment of justice and right and which at the same time promises bet ter administration of their government, fi’he laAv embodying this reform found its Avay to our statute book more from tear ot tbe popular sen timent existing in its favor than from any loa’c for the reform itself on the part of the legisla tors, and it has lived and groAvn and flourished in spite of the open hostility of spoilsmen, and notwithstanding querulous charges of impracticability by many self-constituted guardians, beneath all the va garies and sublimated theories Avhich are ut tiacted to it there underlies this reform a sturdy common-sense principle not only suited to this mundane sphere, but whose application our people arc more and more recognizing to be ab solutely essential to the most successful opera tion of their government, if not to its perpetuity. It seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this reform, as well as with its best enforcement, to oblige the commis sion to rely for clerical assistance upon clerks detailed from other departments. There ought not to be such a condition in any department that clerks hired to do the Avork there car be spared to habitually Avork at an other place, and it does not accord Avith a sensi bly view of civil-service reform that persons should be employed on the theory that their la bor is necessary in one department Avhen in point of fact their sendees are deA'otcdto entire ly different Avork in another department. I earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to carry on the Avork of the commission be regularly put upon its roster, and that the system of obliging the commissioners to rely upon the services of clerks belonging to other departments be discontinued, fi’his ought not to increase the expense to the government. Avbile it would certainly be more consistent and add greatly to the efficiency of the commission. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. Changes Made in the Working Force by ( the New Secretary. fi he report of the secretary of agriculture avill be found exceedingly interesting, especially to 1 that large part of our citizens intimately eon- j corned in agricultural occupations. On the 7th ! day of March, 1893. there Avcre upon its pay-rolls ; 2,430 employes, this number has been reduced i to 1.850 persons. In vieAv of a depleted public i treasury aud the imperative demand of the people for economy in the ad ministration of their government, the sec retary has entered upon the task of rationally reducing expenditures by theelimin ation from the pay-rolls of all persons not needed for an efficient conduct of the affairs of the de partment. During the first quarter of the pres- i cut year the expenses of the department aggro- 1 gated $345,976.76 as against $-102,021.42 for the ' corresponding period of the fiscal year ending I June 30, 1893. The secretary makes apparent his ! intention to continue fins rate of reduction by ! submitting estimates for the next fiscal i year less by $994,280 than those for | the present year. Among the heads of divisions in these departments the changes haA e been ex- | ceedingly tew. 'Three vacancies occurring from ; death and resignation have been filled by the , promotion of assistants in the same divisions. : These promotions of experienced and faithful i assistants have not only been in the interest of efficient Avork but have suggested to those in the department av ho look for retention and promo tion that merit and devoted duty are their best reliance. The amount appropriated for the bureau of animal industry lor the current fiscal year is $850,000; the estimate for the ensuing year is $700,000. fi’he regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been enforced dining the last year and the large stock yards of the country ave been kept free from infection. Occasional local outbreaks have been largely such ns could haA r e been ef- i fectually guarded against by the owners of the | affected cattle. While contagious pneumonia in ! cattle has been eradicated, animal tuberculosis, 1 a disease widespread and more dangerous to • human life than pleuro-pueumonia, i< still i prevalent. Investigations have been made dur ing the past year as to the means of its communi cation and the method of its correct diagnosis. Much progress has been made in this direction by the studies of the division of animal pathol ogy, but Avork ought to Jjc extended in co-oper ation with local authorities until the danger to human life arising from this cause is reduced to a minimum. 'The number of animals arriving from Canada during the year aud inspected by bureau om cers was 462,092, and the number from trans-At- i lautic countries avus 1,297. No contagious dis- ! eases Avere found among imported animals, j The total number of inspections of cattle for i export during the past fiscal year Avere 611,542. I fi’he exports show a falling off’ of about 25 per cent, from the preceding year, | the decrease occurring entirely in the last half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to an in crease in the price of American export cattle. During the year ending June 30, 1893, exports of inspected pork aggregated 20.677,410 pounds as against 38,152,874 pounds for the preceding year. The tailing off in this export was not confined, however, to inspected pork, the total quantity exported in 1892 being 665,490,616 pounds, Avhil*e in 1893 it Avas only 527,308,695 pounds. I join the secretary m recommending that hereafter each applicant for the position of in spector or assistant inspector In the bureau ot animal industry be required as a condition precedent to his appointment to exhibit to the United States civil-service commission his diploma from an established, regular and re putable veterinary college, and that this be supplemented by such an examination in veterinary science as the commission may pre scribe. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1892, attained the enormous figure of $800,000,000, in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent, of our total exports. In the last fiscal year this aggre gate Avas greatly reduced, but nevertheless reached $615,000,000, being 75.1 per cent, of all j American commodities exported. A review of our agricultural exports Avith : special reference to their destination Avill shoAv that in almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, $26,000,000, of Avhich Great Britain took considerable over $25,030,00*1. Of beef products of all kinds our total exports Avere $28,000,000, of Avhich Great Britain took $24,000,- 000. Of pork products the total exports Avere $84,000,000, of which Gieat Britain took $53,000,- 000. On the breadstuff’s, cotton and minor products like proportions sent to the same des tination are shown. The Avork of the statistical division of tbe Department of Agriculture deals with all that relates to economics of farming, fi’he main purpose of its monthly reports is to keep the farmers informed as fully as possible <>f all matters having any influence upon the Avorld’s markets in Avhich their products find sale. Its publications relate especially to the commercial side of farming. It is therefore of profound im portance and vital concern to the farmers of the United States, aa ho represent nearly one-half of our population, and also of direct interest to the Avhole country, that the Avork of this division be efficiently performed and that the informa tion it has gathered be promptly diffused. It is a matter f or congratulation to know that the secretary a\ ill not spare any effort to make this part of liis work thoroughly useful. In the year 1839 the Con press appropriated 

§I,OOO to he taken from the patent office funds for the purpose of collecting and distributing rare and improved varieties of seeds and for prosecuting agricultural investigations and procuring agri cultural statistics. From this small beginning the seed division of the Department of Agri culture has grown to its present unwieldly and unjustifiable extravagant proportions. During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was §66,548.61. The remainder of an appropria tion of $135,000 was expended in putting them upand distributing them. It surely never could have entered the minds of those who first sanc tioned appropriations of public money for the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds for gratuitous distribution that from this would grow large appropriations for the purchase and distribution by members of Congress of ordina ry seeds, bulbs and cuttings which are common 111 all the states and territories and everywhere easily obtainable at low prices. In each state and territory an agricultural ex periment station has been established. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new' varieties of seeds: and yet this indiscrim inate and wasteful distribution by legislation and legislators continues, answering no purpose unless it be to remind constituents that their representatives are willing to remember them with gratuities at public cost. Under the sanc tion of existing legislation there was sent out from the Agricultural Department enough of cabbage seed to plant 19.200 acres of land; a suf ficient quantity of beans to plant 4,000 acres; beet seeds enough to plant 2,500 acres; sweet corn enough to plant 7,800 acres; sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2.025 acres with vines, and enough muskmelon and water melon seeds to plant 2,675 acres. The total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus dis tributed was contained in more than 9,000,000 packages, and they were sufficient if planted to coyer 89,596 acres of land. In view of these facts this enormous expenditure w-ithout legitimate returns of benefit ought to he abolished. An ticipating a consummation so manifestly in the interests of good administration, more than 

§IOO,OOO has been stricken from the estimate to cover this object for the year ending June 30, 1895; and the secretary recommends that the re maining §35,000 of the estimate be confined strictly to the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds and that these be distributed through experiment stations. Thus the seed will be tested, and after test has been completed by the experiment station tin; propagation of the useful varieties and the rejection of the rain less may safely be left to the common sense of the people. ECONOMY IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS. The President Urges Care and Discrim ination in Public Affairs. Economy in public expenditure is a duty that cannot innocently be neglected by those in trusted with the control of money drawn from the people tor public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently endless resources, the familiarity of our people w ith immense accumu lations of w ealth, the growing sentiment among them that the expenditure of public money should in some manner be to their immediate and personal advantage, the indirect and al most stealthy manner in w hich a large part of our taxes are exacted, and a designated sense of official accountability have led to growing extravagance in governmental appropriations. At this -time, w hen a depleted public treasury confronts us, Avhen many of our people are en gaged in a hard struggle for the necessaries of life, and when enforced economy is pressing upon the great mass of our countrymen, I de sire to urge with all the earnestness at my com mand that congressional legislation be so lim ited by strict economy as to exhibit an appre ciation of the condition of the treasury and a sympathy with the strained circumstances of our fellow citizens. The duty of public econ omy is also of immense importance in its inti mate and necessary relation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to meet government expenditures and yet reducing the people’s burden of federal taxation. 

DISCUSSING TARIFF REFORM. T-be President’s View of the Legislation Contemplated. After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before ns. Nothing so important claims our at tention and nothing so clearly presents itself as both an opportunity and a duty—an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow citizens, a duty imposed upon us by our oft-repeated pro fessions and by the emphatic mandate of the peo ple. After full discussion our countrymei have spoken in favor of this reform and they have confided the work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it. If there is anything in the theory of a repre sentation in public places of the people and their desires, if public officers are really the servants of the people, and if political promises and professions have any binding lorce. our lailure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our effort until this reform is accomplished by wise and careful legislation. While w e should staunchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity ’of reve nue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation, and that they should bo limited by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up among ns w hich in justice and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergen cies of our government actually demanded. Manifestly if we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform one of its most obvious features should he a reduction in present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The bene fits of such a reduction would be palpable and substantial and would be seen and felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and bettor sheltered. These gins should be the willing bene actions of a government whose highest function is the promotion of the welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our people’s prosperity arid well being is the removal ot restrictions upon the importation of the raw materials necessary to our manufacturers. The world should be open to our national ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot be while federal legislation through the imposition of high tariff forbids to American manufacturers as cheap materials as those used by their competitors. It is quite obvious that the enhancement of the price of our manufactured products resulting from this policy not only confines the market for these products within our own borders to the di rect disadvantage of our manufacturers, but also increases tneir cost to our citizens. The inter ests of labor are certainly though indirectly in volved in this feature of our tariff system. The sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to supply the limited de mand for their goods, soon fill the narrow mar ket to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of work in mills and factories, a dis charge of employes, and distress in the homes of our workingmen. Even if the often dis proved assertion could be made good that a low er rate of wages would result from free raw ma terials and low tariff duties, the intelligence of our workingmen leads them quickly to discov er that their steady employment, permitted by free raw materials, is the most important factor in their relation to tariff legislation. A measure has been prepared by the appropriate congres sional committee, embodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly submitted for legislative action. It is the result of much patriotic and unselfish w ork, and 1 believe it deals with its subject consist ently and thoroughly as existing conditions permit. lam satisfied that the reduced tariff’ duties provided tor in the proposed legislation, added to existing internal revenue tax ation, will, in the near future, though perhaps not immediately, produce suffi cient revenue to meet the needs of the govern ment. The committee after full consideration and to provide against a temporary deficiency which may exist before the business of the country adjusts itself to the new tariff - schedules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few addi tional internal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived from certain corpor ate investments These new assessments are not only absolutely just and easily borne but they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted without unfavor able business dis'ui btince, whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great desire for the success of tliis measure i cannot restrain the suggestion if success can only be obtained by means cd-un selfish counsel on the part of the fi lends of tar iff reform and as a result of their w illingness to subordinate personal desires and ambitions to the general good. The local interests affected by the proposed reform arc so numerous and so varieu that if 1 11 are insisted upon the legisla tion embodying the reform must inevitably fail. In conclusion my intense feeling of responsi bility impels me to invoke for the manifold in terests of a generous and confiding people the most scrupulous care and to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the ad vancement of the greatness and prosperity ot our beloved country.
