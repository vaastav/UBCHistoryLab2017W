E. B. MURRAY, Editor. THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 9, 1880. TERMS : ONE-YEAR..?Sl.oO. SIX MONTHS.- W. THE LAST CHANCE. The second session of the Forty-seventh Congress assembled in Washington on last Monday. The Democrats have a majority in both branches of the. present Congress, but after the fonrth of March next the Re? publicans will have a plurality in the lower House, the Independentstind Greenbackers holding the balance of power, with the probability that on all political questions they wi&affihate with the Republicans. If lbe.Seb.ate should be Republican, that party will have control of the Federal government for the next two years. It is not probable that any measures of a partisan character will be brought before the present Congress, I and it is more than likely that the present session will be eminently practical and do voted to the consideration of measures pro motive of the general interests of the whole country. The tariff and revenue laws need revision, and now when the country and Congress rest from all Apolitical excitement 13 the time for statesmen of both parties to give to the country a just and equal tariff, one which shall protect the industries of the. country alike without unjust discrimi ? nation'in favor of any industry or against any class of consumers, and one which at the same rime shall raise the largest amount of revenue, and thereby enable Congress to reform and reduce the Internal Revenue taxation. If the Democratic party in this tho last session of its supremacy in both branches of Congress shall secure to the country a sound currency, ignoring repudi . ation and Greenbackism, adopt a tariff for revenue, and at the same time have regard to a just protection of the industrial inter? ests of the country, arid so reform the Inter? nal Revenue taxes that they shall' not oper? ate unjustly against thn industries of limited .portions of the country, it will receive the commendation of all sections and parties. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Hayea on last Monday com - mnnicated to both Houses of Congress his last annual message. It is quite lengthy, and if it were not for the recom? mendation of a new crusade against the South which it contains, would strike the publio as containing suggestions emi? nently wise and national. The President assumes that "continued opposition to the foil and free enjoyment of the rights of citizenship, conferred upon the colored people by the recent amendments to the Constitution, still prevails in several of the late slayeholding States," and asks Congress to pass firm and well- considered measures to enforce the Fifteenth Amend? ment, which means that "the Federal Government shall control all Federal . elections' in the Southern States. The President further recommends the House . of Representatives and the Senate to see to it that every case of the violation of tbe letter or spirit of the Fifteenth Amend? ment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any person or party, which means that the next Congress shall ex? clude such members of Congress and Senators as the Republicans may deem expedient The President further asks Congress for sufficient appropriations to prosecute unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights guaranteed to them by the Consti? tution. Whatever may be the merits of the remainder of the Message, this por? tion of it is a dark spot which mars the whole, and identifies the President with the stalwarth element of bis party, and that instead of seeking at tbe close of his administration to heal all sectional feel? ings, it is his desire to kindle afresh the fires of sectional hate and animosity. We are satisfied that every reader of tho Intelligencer will be gratified to learn of the great increase in the shipping business of our "City by the Sea," which is shown by the following comparative statement, taken from the News and Cou? rier: "The total value of the exports from this port for tbe first three months .of the business year commencing September 1, 1880, is $7,709,635 against $6,726,313 for the same period last year, an increase of $1,083,322 in tbice months. Tbe value of tbe imports for the same period were $14,171.26 for 1SS0 and $11,787.83 for 1879, an increase of $2,3S3.43. during the three months just closed there were 23 foreign steamships entered at the custom house with an aggregate tonnage of 34,127 tons, against 1G vessels with an aggregato ton? nage of 20,761 tons during the same period last year." Every South Caro? linian should feel a deep interest in Cnarleston, aud rejoice at her increasing prosperity. When she gets that long coveted direct connection with the great Northwest by tbe completion of the Blue Ridge Railrood, she will becomo without a doubt the Queen City of the South. Notwithstanding the great hue and cry raised by the designing stalwart* of the Radical party about tbe frauds commit? ted by the enumerators in taking tbe census in this State, Superintendent Walker, in a rocent report on the subject, says that "no specific allegation of fraud in the enumeration of South Carolina has ever been made at this office." Pie is at least one Federal officer, appointed by a Radical President, that seems to have a spark of honesty in his heart. There are four colored Domocrats in the Legislature, one from Colleton and three from Charleston. They are all intelligent men, and by uniting and co-operating with the only political party in this State that can command the rospect of honest men, reflect credit upon their raco. They are all quiet, unobtrusive business men, and are highly respected by tho people of their counties. Messrs. Sample and West more, of North Carolina, were in Columbia last week for the purpose of perfecting arrangements made some time back with the Board of Penitentiary Directors for the manufacture of shoes in the Peniten? tiary. These gentlemen propose to enter largely into tho business of manufac? turing shoes within the prison walls with convict labor. Rufus Henry and W. F. Anderson have discovered a vein of silver on Mr. Frank Anderson'.?*, place, near Mt. Carmel, in Abbeville County, and have gono rcgu < trly to work, and the Medium says the ?-sin is rich and a fortune is sure. In tho ?tme section rich deposits of gold have baen found on tho places of W. H. Brock . nd A. O. Grant. Peter Paschal, colored, voted the Dem? ocratic ticket at Due West at tho late elec :">n. He is represented to be 120 years ??Id, and to luve been wagon driver du ing tho Revolutionary War. He still Klieves "in tho principles for which Lee <? id Jackson fought," and that England \i ill yet recognize tho Confederate States Mr. J. R. Penitt, a white man about 26 years old, living near Branson, in this State, attempted suicide on the 30th ult. by shooting himself twice, severely ii uot mortally wounding himself, while in a fit of insanity. Ho has a wife aud five children, and has twice before attempted to take his own life. The Presidential Electors for South Carolina met in Columbia on Wednes? day, the first day of December; and cast the seven elec^ral votes of the State for W. S. Hancock for President, and W. H. English for Vice-President. Pink Poole, a colored man, had his arm torn to pieces in Mr. Frank Anderson's gin in Abbeville County week before last. Up to the 1st instant, inclusive, Abbe? ville has shipped 9,601 bales of cotton, nbout 5,000 less than Anderson. A large number of negroes are leaving Abbeville County to work in the phos? phate mines on the coast. THE

I Tho bill (with amendment) to amend an Act entitled "An Act to secure land? lords ;:nd persons making advances" passed a --scond reading. The bill reported by the Judiciary Committee to extend the time for fund? ing bills of tho Bank of the State created a lively discussion. Senators Callison, Miller aud Maxwell spoke against it on the ground that it would open tho door for those who retained thei" bills for speculative purposes, and udmit bills dis? honestly reissued under Radical rule, i while Senators Smytho, Wylio-and Hen? derson favored it as a measure of relief for innocent holders who had not known of tho funding in time to send their bills I in. 1 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

The bill, as reported by the committee, provided for three commissioners, at a salary of $3,000 each, to do the work. A motion was made to amend by giv? ing the work to one man, which elicited the first discussion in the House of tho session, in which Mr. Rucker, of Ander? soff, favored tho amendment, not from motives of economv, but becauso be be? lieved that the work would be more effi? ciently dono by one man than three. There would be no delay in the work, as a committee of one would always be sit? ting. A vote was taken, and the amendment was lost Mr. Murray moved to reduce the pay of tho commissioners from $3,000 to $2,000 each.

The agricultural committee reported a bill to authorizo boards of county com? missioners to proenro and establish in each county standard scales for weigh? ing cotton and all products sold by weight. The first matter among the general or? ders which occasioned any debate was a bill seeking to abolish the costs of plain? tiff's and defendants' attorneys in the Courts of Common Pieas and limiting those fees in the Supreme Court to fifteen dollars for an appeal and twenty-five dol? lars far an argument. Mr. Simpson of this County favored the bill. The costs in civil actions were entirely too high. They were in most instances ruinous, and he hoped tbo bill would pass. It was killed by a vote of 72 to 43. In tho night session of tbo House the time was engaged mostly in alenghthy discussion over the bill to repeal the lien law. Messrs J. C. Wilson, Barber, Crawford aud Murray favored killing the bill, on tbe ground that the present lien law was a necessity to three-fourths of tbe farmers of tho State, and that the time had not yet arrived when it could safely be repealed. Mr. Tindall favored tho bill, taking the ground that the lien law was extraordi? nary, and adopted at a timo when the people were imperished by war and un? able to secure credit by reason of the unsettled condition of affairs. The State is now piosperous and in a Stato of peace, and be thought that the peoplo would bo far better olf without tbe law. They would bo encouraged to build up credit on their own business integrity, and would not be forced to nccopt the ruin? ous rates charged for supplies by the por sons making advances.

[This is about tho sixth bill of this kind which has been in? troduced at this session. Most of its pre? decessors have been rejected on unfavor? able committee reports.] The first matter among the general orders was upon tho joint resolution re? ported by tho Committee of Ways and Means favoring an appropriation of ?2,000 for tho Cowpens' Centennial. Several j speeches were made on this resolution, soino favoring and somo opposing its passage. Mr. Murray moved to amend by reducing the proposed appropriation to $1,000. Mr. Simpson spoke in favor of the amendment, but upon tho vote being taken it was lost by a vote of 52 to 40. The resolution then" passed its second reading, providing for an appropriation of $2,000.

The Senate still keeps up with Its work, clearing a heavy calendar to-day, while in? dulging in an* hour's debate on one bill. Almost a third of the seats were empty, many senators not having returned from their Sunday trips home. The influx of bills has subsided and no notices were given to-day. The following was introduced : Bill to amend Section 10 of an Act to regulate the costs of fees of courts of Pro? bate Judges and other officers. The Calendar came up, and the two bills for the revision and codification of the laws, which were the spcuial order for to-day, were made the special order for to-morrow at two o'clock. The substitute offered by*the judiciary committee for bills establishing the office of Master in Colleton and Bickens Counties was laid over under the rules. It provides for Masters for all tbe Counties. The reports (majority and minority) on the sent of the Hon. T.* B. Jeter was, ?n ac? count of the absence of senators interested, made a special order for to-morrow.

The report of the agricultural committee on the report of the State Agricultural So? ciety was adopted. (This allows the usual $-2,500 appropriation from the State.) The House bill ratifying the amendment to Section 32, Article i of'the Constitution, relating to the homestead, was passed?yeas 25, nays none. The bill amendingthe Act prohibiting the traffic in seed cotton, while only making the present law more explicit, created a lively contest on its second reading to-day. Sena? tor Perry moved to amend by totally pro? hibiting the sale. Senator Wylic thought that would operate against those who did not make enough to pack a bale, and kept landowners front taking seed cotton lor iant. It waa too sweeping a remedy. Senator Perry thought the present law was nullified by thieves selling in daylight what they had stolen at night. Senator Fishburnc moved the indefinite postponement of the prohibitory amend? ment. It operated against the poorer classes, was unjust and totally unconstitu? tional. They might as w%U prohibit the sale of corn or other agricultural products. No law which was too harsh could be en? forced. Senator Perry then withdrew his amend? ment. Senator Miller then opposed the bill in Mo, as a great hardship on the people of Beaufort County, at least, where cotton was raised in small lots. Senator Wylic said that restrictions for moral reasons were already placed on the sale of other commodities, and if this pro? hibition diminished larceny it would be a boon to the people. Senator Miller's motion to strike out the prohibitory clause was defeated. Senator Lartigue moved to recommit iho bill to the committee, with an amendment, allowing traffic in seed cotton in t!<e day time only to licensed vendors. Senator Callison offered a substitute that no person deal in seed cotton in less quanti? ties than five hundred pounds between the 1st of September and the 1st of January. Senator Miller said that this was class legislation of tho worst kind. Senator Fishburne moved the indefinite postponement of amendments. Then there was a good deal of personal sparring and several personal explanations before the bill was finally recommitted to the committee with all the amendments This was the first time that the Senate has seemed warmed up this session. house of representatives. During the Speaker's absence Mr. Simonton occupied his chair. Among the new measures introduced were the following: A concurrent resolution that 10,000 copies of the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture bo printed for distribu? tion. Adopted.

The concurrent resolution providing a commission to amend the State Constitu? tion, and the bill to provide for the ap? pointment of a commission to consider and suggest amendments to the Consti? tution of tho State, which were made special orders to come up together to-day, ?were postponed until Wednesday next.
