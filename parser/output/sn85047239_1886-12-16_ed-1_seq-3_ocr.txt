Macfarlane Co agents V TLIE TREATY President Cleveland Recommends a Seven Years Extension of the Hnwnllan Treaty In his annual message to Congress President Cleveland refers as follows to the treaty with Hawaii I express my unhesitating conviction that the intimacy of our relations with Hawaii should be emphasized As a result of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 those Islands on the highway of Oriental and Australian traffic arc virtually an outpost of American com merce and a stepping stone to the growing trade of the Pacific The Polynesian Island groups have been so absorbed by other and more powerful governments that the Hawaiian Islands arc left almost alone in the enjoyment of their autonomy which it is im portant for us should be preserved Our treaty is now terminable on one years notice but propositions to abro gate it will in my judgment be ill ad vised The paramount influence we have there acquired once relinguished could only with difficulty be regained and a valuable coien of vantacc for ourselves might be converted into a stronghold for our commercial competi tors I earnestly recommend that the existing treaty stipuhtions be extended for a further term of seven years A recently signed treaty to this end is now before the Senate The import ance of telegraphic communication be tween those Islands and the United States should not be overlooked SAN
