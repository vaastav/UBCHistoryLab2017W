Washington, Dec 11 In the absence of President Frye, Senator Piatt, of Connecticut, was designated to occupy the chair in the senate yesterday. Sen ator Hoar presented the resolutions of the Massachusetts legislature in favor of a constitutional amendment provid ing for uniform hours of labor In man ufactures In the United States. Sena tor Mason, of Illinois, then called up the resolution he introduced a few days ago, expressing the sympathy of the senate with the South African re publics in their war with Great Britain and extending to them the hopes of the senate for the success of their arms His address at times-was vehement al most passionate. He maintained that under the Monroe doctrine and on pre ceden ts previously well established, this government had the right to extend its sympathy and hopes for success to the Boers in'their struggle for liberty as it had to Interfere with Spain in its con duct of affairs in Cuba. He urged that the Interest of this country was aroused by the fact that the South African war was a struggle between democracy and royalty between the divine right of kings and the divint right of man. At its conclusion Senator Lodge said there was a wide gulf between private opinion and public official ex pression. The executive department of the government, he said, had as sumed a neutral attitude toward the South African war, The passage of this resolution by the senate would change immediately the attitude. "II we are to depart from the position ol neutrality, said Senator Lodge, "It ought to be a subject of most serious consideration." He moved, therefore, that the resolution be sent to the com mittee of foreign relations and it was so ordered. At 8:05 the senate went iuto execu tive session. At 3:35 the senate re sumed business in open session. A message was presented from the house announcing the death of Representa tive Samuel Baird, of Louisiana.

U was characterized by all the wit and eloquence for which the Iowan is noted and held the membjrs without regard to party for more than an hour. Mr. Dolliver declared that the last doubt in the republican party as to the wisdom of enacting the gold standard into law had been resolved by the experience ol the business world during the pasl three years. He scored Mr. Bryan and generally ridiculed the alleged false prophecies of the democrats in 1800. Mr. De Armoutl, of Missouri, was the heavy gun on the democratic side. He warned the republicans from the west that they could not deceive their con stituents in the coming congressional elections by claiming that they had yielded to the wisdom of their col leagues in caucus. Mr. Overstreet, of Indiana, opened the debate in support of the bill. He said amongst other things: The advocates of currency reform Srrtalv de clare that the ttnanclal operations of the govern ment are upon the gold standard, but that tut honest feara eniundcml by doubtful leclslatloi relative to silver coinage and the persistent attack upon the standard or value, fully Justlfj the legislation asked.
