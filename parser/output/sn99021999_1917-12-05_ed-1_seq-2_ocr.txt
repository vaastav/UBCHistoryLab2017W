i FULL TEXT OF PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE BEFORE CONGRESS Chief Executive of United States Declares for War on Austria-Hungary at Once. REPARATION BY GERMANY Tells World This Country Ex pects Kaiser's Government to Right Wrongs on Bel- gium and France. (Br AniocUUd rreM.) Washington, Dec 4 President Wilson delivered to congress today an address,- considered to important in its relation to international affairs, that it has been transmitted in ad vance by the government to practical ly every other capital in the world The president spoke as follows: "Gentlemen of the congress: "Eiglit months have elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you They have been months crowded with events 01 immense ana grave signin cance iov tis. "I shall not undertake to detail or even to summarize those events. The practical particulars of the part we have played in them will be laid be- for you in the reports ot the executive departments. "I shall discuss only our present outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties and the immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always in view. ' "I shall not go back to debate the. causes of the war. The intolerable wrongs done and planned against us by. the sinister masters of Germany have long since become grossly od vious and odious to every true Amer ican to need to be rehearsed. "But 1 shall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny our objectives and the measures by which we mean to attain them: for the Duroose of discussion here in this place is action and our action must move straight towards definite enos, To Win the War. "Our object is, of course, to win the war. and we shall not slacken or sur fer ourselves to be diverted until it is won. But it is worth while asking and answering the question when shall we consider the war won?" "From one point of view it is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the American people know what the war is about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of ineir purpose '! u. , , , '.'As a nation we are united in spirit and intention. I pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices 6f dissent who does not? 1 hear the criticism and the clamor of thenoisily, thoughtless and trouble some. "I also see menliere and there fling themselves in impotent disloyalty against Jthe calm, indomitable power of the t nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither its na ture nor the way in which we may attain it with uplifted eyes and un broken spirits. BVt I know that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be' forgotten. Can Be No Compromise. ; "But from r.nothef point of view I believe that it is necessary to say plainly what we here at the seat of actiotn consider the. war to be for and what part we mean to play in the settlement of its searching issues. We are the spokesmen of the American people and they have a right to know whether their purpose is ours. "They desire peace by the overcom ing of evil, by the defeat once for all of the sinister forces that interrupt peace and render it impossible,, and they wish to know how closely our thought runs with theirs and what ac - tion we propose. They are impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of compromise deeply and in dignantly impatient but they will be equally impatient with us if we do not make it plain to them what our ob jectives are and what we are plan ning for in seeking to make conquest )f peace by arms. "1 believe that I speak for them when I say two things: "First, that this intolerable thing of which the masters of Germany have hown us the ugly face, this menace combined intrigue and force which we now sec so clearly as the German power, thing without conscience or honor or capacity for covenanted peace, must be crushed, and, if it be not utterly brought to an end, at least iiut out from the friendly intercourse oi the nations; and, "Second, that when this thing and its power as indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss peace when the German people have spokesmen whose word we can be lieve and when those spokesmen are teidy in the name of their people to accept the common judgment of the nations as to what shall henceforth be the bases of law and of covenant for the life of the world we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price ?or peace and pay it ungrudgingly. "We know what that price will be. It will be full, impartial justice jus tice done at every point andto every nation the final settlement must af fect, our enemies at well as our riends. . Voices of Humanity. "You catch, with me, the voices of humanity that are in the air. They grow daily more audible, more ar ticulate, more persuasive, and they ':ome from the hearts of men every where. They insist tfcat the war shall not end in vindictive action of any kind; that no nation or people shall jc robbed or punished because the ir responsible rulers of a single country lave themselves done deep and tbominable wrong. "It is this thought that has been expressed in the formula, 'no annexa tions, no contributions,' no punitive indemnities,' just because this crude formula , expresses . the instinctive judgment as to right of plain men everywhere it has been made diligent sse of by the masters of German intrigue to lead the people of Russia jstray and the people of every oth er country their agents could reach, in order that a premature peace might be brought about before autocracy has been, taught its final and con fincine lesson and the people of the world put in control of their. own des tinies.' "But the fact that a wrong use has been made of a just idea is no reason why a right use should not be made of it. It ought 'to be brought under the patronage of its real friends. "Let it be said again that autocracy must first be shown the utter futility of its claims to power or leadership in the modern world. "It is impossible to apply any standard of justice so long as such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the present masters of Germany command. "Not until that has been done can right be set up as arbiter and peace maker among the nations. "But when that has been done as God willing it assuredly will be we shall at last be free to do an unpre cedented thing and this is ,the time to avow our purposes to do it. We shall be free to base peace on gen erosity and justice, to the exclusion of all selfish claims to advantage even on the part of the victors. 'NO 

PEACE TILL WAR WON. "Let there be no misunderstanding. Our present and immediate task is to win the the war and nothing shalt turn us aside from it until it is ac complished. Every power! and re source we possess, whether of men, of money or of materials, is being de voted and will continue to be de voted to that purpose until it is achieved. "Those who, desire to bring peace about before that purpose is achieved, I counsel to carry their advice else where. We will not entertain it. We shall regard the war as won only when the German people say to us, through properly' accredited repre sentatives, that they are ready to agree to a settlement based upon justice and the reparation of the 'wrongs their rulers have done. "They have done a wrong to Bel gium which must be repaired. They have established a power over other lands and peoples than their own over the gnat empire of Austria Hungary, over hitherto free Balkan states, over Turkey and within Asia which must be relinquished. "Germany's success by skill, by in dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise, we did not grudge or oppose, but ad mired rather. She had built up for herself a real empire of trade and in fluence, secured by the peace of the world. ' "We were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture, science and commerce that were involved for us in her success and stand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and the initiative to surpass her. , Peace Must. Remedy Wrong. , "But at the moment when she had conspicuously won her . triumphs -of peace she threw them away to estab lish in their stead what the world will no longer permit to be estab lishedmilitary and political domina tion by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated.' The peace we make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of Bel. gium and northern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace' but it must also deliver the peoples of Austro-Hungary, the people of Turkey, alike in . Europe and in Asia, from the impudent and alien domination of the Prussian mili tary and commercial autocracy. We owe it, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any way to imoair or to rearrange the Austro- Hungarian empire. It is no affair of ours what they do with their own life, either industrially or politically.. Will Not Dictate. . We do not purpose or desire to dic tate to them in any way. We only de sire to see that their affairs are left in their own hands, in all matters, great or small. i . We shell hone to secure for the peoples of the Balkan peninsula and for the people of the Turkish empire the right and opportunity to make their own lives safe, their own for tunes secure against oppression or injustice and from the dictation of foreign courts or, parties. . And our attitude and purpose with regard to Germany itself are of a like kind. We intend no wrong against the German empire, no. interference with its internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other ab solutely unjustifiable, absolutely con trary to the principles we have pro fessed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a, na tion. "The people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now per mit to deceive them and to act as their masters that they are fighting for the very life and existence of their empire, a war of desperate self-defense against deliberate aggression. Germans Wantonly Deceived. "Nothing'could be more grossly or wantonly, false and we must seek by the utmost openness and candor as to our real aims to convince them of its falseness. We -are. in fact, fight ing for their emancipation from fear, along with our own, front the fear as well as from the act ot unjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers after world empires. None is threaten ing the existence or the independence or the peaceful ente rprise of the Ger man empire. , "The worst that can haDoen to the detriment of the German people is this that if they should still, after the war is over, continue to be obliged to live under ambitious and intriguing masters interested to disturb the peace ot the world, men or classes of men whom the other peoples of the world could not trust, it might be impossi ble to admit them to partnership of nations which must henceforth guar antee the world's peace. "That partnership must be a part nership of peoples, not a mere part nership of governments. It might be impossible, also, in such untoward circumstances, to admit Germany to the free economic intercourse which must inevitably spring out of the other partnerships' of a real peace. "But there would be no aggression in that; and such a situation, inevit able because of distrust, would in the very nature of things sooner or later cure itself by processes which would assuredly set in. . "The wrongs, the -very deep wrongs, committed in this war will have to be righted. That, of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the commission of simi lar wrongs against Germany and her allies. , "The world will not permit the com- THE BEE;

Statesmen must by this time have learned that the opinion of the world is everywhere wide awake and fully comprehends the issues involved. "No representative of any self-governed nation will dare disregard it by attempting any , such covenants of selfishness and compromise as were entered into at the congress of Vienna. The thought of the plain people here and everywhere through out the world, the people who enjoy no privilege and have very simple and unsophisticated standards of right and wrong, is the air all governments must henceforth breathe if they would live. Germany Upset World Peace. "It is in the full disclosing light of that thought that all policies must be conceived and executed in this mid day hour of the world's life. "German rulers have been able to upsst the peace of the world only be cause the German people were not suffered under their tutelege to share the comradeship of the other peoples of the world either in thought or in purpose. "They were allowed to have no opin ion of their own which might be set up as a rule of conduct for those who exercised authority over them. But the congress that concludes this war wijl feel the full strength of the tides that run now in the hearts and con sciences of free men everywhere. Its conclusions will run with those tides. " "All these ' things have been true from the very beginning of this stu pendous war; and I, cannot help thinking that if they had been made plain at the very outset the sym pathy and enthusiasm of the Russian people might have been once for all enlisted on the side of the allies, sus picion and distrust swept away and a real and iasting union of purpose af fected. "Had they believed these things at the very moment of their revolution and had they been confirmed in that belief since, the sad reverses which have recently marked the progress of their affairs toward an ordered and stable government of free men might have been avoided. "The Russian people have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people in the dark, and the poison has been ad ministered by the same hands. The only possible antidote is the truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly or too often. Seek Permanent Peace. "From every point of view, there fore, it has seemed, to by my duty to speak these declarations of uur- pose, to add these specific interpreta tions to what . I took the liberty of saying to the senate in January. Our entrance into the war has not al tered our attitude towards the settle ment that must come when it is over. "When I said in January that the nations of the' world were entitled not only to free pathways upon the sea, but also to assured and unmolested access to those pathways, I was think ing, and I am thinking now, not of the smallerand weaker nations alone, which need our countenance and sup port, but also of the great and power ful nations, and of our present ene mies al well as our present associ ates in the war. ' I was thinking, and am thinking now, of Austria itself, among the rest, as well as of Serbia and of Poland. Justice and equality of rights can be had only at a great price. We are seeking permanent, not temporary, foundations for the peace of the world and must seek them candidly and fearlessly, as al ways the right will prove to be the! expedient. "What shall we do then to push this great war of freedom and justice to its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all impediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unif. 1 1 No War on Allies. "One very embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way is that we are at 'war with Germany, but not with her allies. I,. therefore, veTy earnest ly recommend that the congress im mediately declare the United States in a state of war with Austria-Hun gry. , "Does it seem strange to you that this should be the' conclusion of the argument I have just addressed to you? It is not, It is, in fact, the in evitable logic of which I have said. Austria-Hungary is for the time be ing Mot her own mistress, but simply the vassal of the German government. We must face the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment in this stern business. . "The government of Astro-ITun-gary is not acting upon its own initi ative or in response to i the ' wishes and" feelings of its own peoples, bu: as the instrument of another nation. We must meet its force with our own and 'regard the central cowers as but one. The war can be successfully j conducted in no' other way. , Turkey and Bulgaria Tools. "The same logic would, lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria.

152&DOD0E 1890 r if of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand in the direct path of our necessary action. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but it seems to me that we should go only where imme diate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others. "The financial and military meas ures which must be adopted will sug gest themselves as the war and its undertakings develop, but 1 will take the liberty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seem to me to be needed for the support of the war and for the release of our whole force and energy. "It will be necesary to extend in certain particulars the legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemies; and also necessary, I believe, to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and depar ture of all persons into and from the United States.". "Legislation should be enacted de fining as a criminal offense every;wil ful violation of the presidential proc lamations relating to alien enemies promulgated under section 4067 . of the revised statutes and providing ap propriate punishments, and women as well as men should be included under the terms of the acts, placing re straints upon alien enemies. "It is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will be wilting to be fed and housed at the expense of the government in the "detention camps and it would be the purpose of the legislation i have suggested to confine offenders among them in peni tentiaries and other similar institu tions, 'where they could be made to work as otner criminals ao. MUST LIMIT PRICES. "Recent experience has convinced me that the congress .must go fur ther in authorizing the government to set limits to prices. 1 he law of supply and demand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the law of unrestrained selfishness. While we have eliminated profiteer ing in several branches of industry, it still runs impudently .ampant m oth ers. The farmers, for example, with a great deal of justice that, while the regulation of food prices restricts their incomes, no restraints are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must themselves purchase, and similar inequities obtain on all sides. It is imperatively necessary that the consideration of the full ;use of the water power of the country and also the consideration of the systematic and yet, economical development of such of the natural resources of the country as are still under the control of the federal government should be immediately and affirmatively and constructively dealt with at the ear liest possible moment. The pressing need of such legislation is daily be coming more obvious. To Regulate Exports. . The legislation proposed at the last session with regard to regulated com binations among our exporters, in order to provide for our foreign trade a more effective v organization and method of co-operation, ought by all means to be completed at this session. ."And I beg that the members of the house of representatives will per mit me to express the opinion that it will be impossible to deal in any way but a very wasteful and extrava gant fashion with the enormous ap propriationj of the. public moneys which must continue to be made, if the war is to be properly sustained, unless the house will consent to re turn to its practice of initiating and preparing all appropriation bills through a single committee, in order that responsibility may be centered, expenditures standardized and made uniform and waste and duplication as much as possible avoided. Co-ordinate Rail Lines.. "Additional legislation may,ateo be-, come necessary before the present congress adjourns in order to affect the lost efficient ' co-ordination and operation of the railway i and other transportation systems of the coun try; but to that I shall, if circum stances should demand, call the at tention of congress upon another oc casion. , If I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for the more .effec tive conduct of the war, your own counsels will supply the .omission. What I am perfectly clear' about is that in the present session of the congress our whole attention and energy should be concentrated on the vigorous and -apid and successful prosecution of the great task of win ning the war. "We can do this with all the greater
