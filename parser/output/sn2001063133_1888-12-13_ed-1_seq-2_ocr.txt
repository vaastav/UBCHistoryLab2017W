It is now definitely settled that the romantio incidents narrated in nu tter's "Barbara Fritchie" hud little foundation in fact but that the story chiefly emanated from the fertile bruin of the popular novelist, Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southwortli, is not generally known. That such was the case, how ever, we have Mr. Whittier's own as surance. The original story is •.••ap posed .to have obtaiued circulation through a graiulnephew of Barbara Fritchie, who. was a clerk in Washing ton, and who related some anecdote of "Annt Barbara's" patriotism within the hearing of Mrs. Southwortli, who com municated it to Wbittier. Xo doubt somewhere betweon the narrators such enlargements and additions as fiction and poetry ure liable to' beget, wore iniule the foundation facts.

The most remarkable of the hot winds is-the moom, the'viole nt whirl wind, wi .li without saud which af fects tin- sorts of Africa and South west Asia. The great heat of the soil v'itMiiig into the atmosphere causes an appreciable expansion and lighten ing of the latter, resulting iu the forma tion of small cyclonic disturbances. The surrounding atmosphere, iu. the never-ceasing natural struggle to main tain an equilibrium, rushes in to fill the space vacated by the expanded air, and in its turn undergoes the same process until at last there is a powerful current drawn into the vortex, frequent ly bringing with it quantities of loose saud, onl the cyclone then becomes visible—hugo columns of saiul whirling round and moving forward at the :samo time.

Bruce ou the head with tho hatchet and then crowded his dazed victim against the wall and deliberately plunged the dagger nine times into Bruco's neck and face. The victim cried ont for his wife and the bravo womar vushod into the room and clutched the blood-bespat tered anarchist arouud tho neck, dragging him aWay from her husband just as he was lifting the hatchet to brain the holpless man. A terrible struggle between tho frantic wife and the anarchist then took place. Ht) was wild with murderous hate, and holding his bloody knife iu hand he rushed about the room endeavoring to again get at the dying Bruce. Ho finally did get by tho wife and reached Bruce, when the latter, who is of giant frame, struggled to his Jfeet in a dying effort, and, grabbing a shovel, struck Hacker a blow on. the head and he fled and is still at huge.

Thomas Axworthy, the defaulting city treasurer of Cleveland, who is now iu London, has made a proposition to return $1011,000 to the city and iu two years to pay his bondsmen if the prosecution is dropped and ho is permitted lo return to America. A Hag Tuckers' Trust. A rumor gained currency in St. Louis lost week that the Chicago hog packers were ot work forming a master trust to embrace the loading packers of Chicago, St. Louis, St. Paul, Dos Moines, Omaha, Sioux City, Kansas City aud Cincinnati. About threo weeks ago tho East St. Louis Packing company sold its entire plant to gentlemen who represent a trust or com bination of the leading Chicago packers. Tliere are only two packing houses at St. LouiB. Francis Whittaker & Sons were approached and invited to come into tho combine, but refused. The houses at Des Moines, Kansas City and Omaha are owned by tho Chicago mon, and will form the nucleus of tho pool. Business has not been profitable of late. A later report from Kansas City has this to fay on the subject: The report that the K.nu\tf. City packers have joined what is known as "The .Hog Product Combine," a trust composed of western packers, cr vted more merimeut than anything else. Ink ers here deny having any connection with the alleged trust. Said S. B. Armour: "You can depend udou the statement that the report is wholly false. I bolieve it started iu tho fact that provisions havo been going down iu the last fow days. And hogs will go lower still. Why, thero is -a big crop and thero is really no reason for high-priced hogs. This talk of trusts is like the beef trust. That senate investigation fizzled ont, and so would an investigation into this illegal hog trust. There is another thing that can guide yon in this matter. You see, all tho packing concerns are headed by wealthy men who are thoroughly independent and watch their investments carefully. Now, these men would never dream of intrusting their affairs to one general head. They want to see just where their money goes to. Thero is no business iu which competition is closor than among packers, and they are fighine each other all the time. Depend upon two things: There is and will bo no pork packing trust and the price of hogs will go lower." I.atest Market Itopnrta. HIOUX CITY.

'f Some Valuabla Information for the Plow man, Stockman, Poulterer, NurMry man, and Eiirj'bodf Connected lrltli the iamb, ~m THE FABM. 'Sil'SSM Be«tB for Cattle Feed. A careful consideration of the subject in nil its bearings by JanieB X. H. Gre gory, Mnrblehend, Mass., hns decided this practical cultivator that "beets for cattlo-food are well worth fully as many cents per bushel as good hay is worth dollars por ton without taking into con sideration the increase of tho manure, aud that the average cost, when stored iu tho cellar or put into pits, with every item of expense included, need not ex ceed 8 cents per bushel. Ilollluf Young Wheat. Wlion tho soil is rough nnd cloddy, aud there is a fear that the young plants are not well rooted, rolling is a safe and desirable practice. If the wheat has r?u innuv.rsd .r! :rt'y. top dressing of Rome mixed feitilizer may bo made ut loll pounds superphosphate of lime, 200 pounds of German potash salts, or 100 pounds of muriate of potash, nnd fifty pounds of nitrate of soda. This will be sufficient now, but it might be repeated in the spring as soon a9 the young growth starts. We would not advise you to sow timothy seed now, but to wait until the winter is over, and sow it on the surface when t^jis is cricked an?. loosened by a late frost. This is the safest course. Feod for Breeding: AntmnU. Breeding sows must not be made too fat. This fact is generally recognized by breeders, and the danger of pigs fat tening is probably greater than with most other domestic stock. But tho food for growth rather than for fat, which tho swine breeder requires for breeding sows, is alRO advisable for all animals intended to be kept for breeding pur poses. A mixture of wheat bran and [round oats is cheaper as well as better ood than any other grain. It is also ex cellent for all males kept to propagate their species. Bucks need some such feod wnen required to serve a large number of ewes. It is ftjpo.very advant ageous for the latter, so as to bring thein all iu heat at nearly the same time, so that the lambs may be droppod at the same time or with slight difference in their ages. Fruit or Vngotables- The question is asked: What is tho distinction between a fruit and a veg etable? It is impossible to draw any hard and fast line between these two, for the terms are used indiscriminately. Perhaps one might say that fruit is eaten raw, while vegetables are cooked before coming to table, were not the tomato and others eaten both raw and cooked. Botauically speaking, the term "fruit" is strictly applied to the mature pistil or ovary with the seeds in its interior. Tho vegetable marrow, pea, beau, pumpkin, and cucumber, though always regarded as vegetables, are true fruits. Other vegetables are various parts of plants, g, turnips and parsnips are enlarged rootB, truffles enlarged Bpore cases, po tatoes swollen underground branohes, spinaoh and broccoli the whole plant, onions thickened fleshy leaves, cabbage thick clusters of leaves protecting the central growing point and Brussels sprouts similar clusters protecting side branches. Driving Up Cows. A correspondent of the Country Gen tleman comically says: Another neat thing in cow-care is to drive np the •ows from the field with a boy and dog. You see, it saves so much time to gay: "Johnny, take Bover and drive up the cows, and be quick about it, will you?" Tho grin that spreads over Johnny's face when ho gets this order would light up a dark cellar during an eclipse of the moon. Going to the pasture he leaves three of the bars up (saying to himself: "I believe I will try four bars to-morrow evening") then he and Rover first drive the cows to tho far end of the pasture when he gives the word to the dog and they start the herd toward the bars gen tly at first, and then increasing the pace until they are half way to the bars, (you see Johnny wont to an agricultural fair and saw a hurdie race) the final word is given to Hover with a whoop, "sick'em!" Aa Hover did not go to the fair there iB~no "pulling," aud it is a sight to see these cows iu full run, and when they come to the bars they clear them with only a few tumbles, and they come into tho barnyard in good order, but considerably blown. Very often this man's cows abort, and lie talks wisely about "epidemic abortion," and resignedly about "his bad luck." THE APIA11Y. Belter Than Stnoke. Ths British Bee Journal gives the following as a better way of quieting boes than by smoke: One and one-half ounces of Calvert's No. 5 carbolic acid, one and a half ounceB glycerine, one quart of warm water. The acid and glycerino tc be well mixed before adding the water, and the bottle to be well shaken before us ing. A piece of calico, or preferably cheese-cloth, Bufilciently large to cover tho top of the hive should be Bteeped in this solution, wrung out dry, and spread over the hivo on tho removal of the quilt, when every bee will quickly dis appear below, and manipulation may be slov owly and quietly annoyanoc from the bees. Tho same performed without rom plan is effectual in driving bees out of section-cases. From unsealed sections thoy often rofnse to budge, but a littlo blowing through the strainer will always dislodge them. All of our sections are thus removed, and we have never expe rienced the slightest scent or flavor of the carbolic aoid attaching to the comb or honoy. This unpleasant result oc curs only to bunglers, who either use too strong a solution, or do not wring ont the carbonized sheet snfticientlv dry, and so besprinkle tho comb honey with the solution, and charge the evil'result of their own stupidity on those who l'ec ommend tho process. The strength of tho solution quickly passes away, as the acid evaporates when"exposed to the air. Ueo Catechism. Au exchange asks that the following bit of information bo sent the rouuds of tho papers, giving it an equal "boom" with the bogus honey stories: What is the chief end of bees?—To get out patent hives. What is the best potent hive?—The best hivo is not patented. .^ But don't some of theso patent hives fool tho moth?—No tbey fool the men who buy them: What patent hive iB the most useful?— Tho new ono in tho barn with a hen's nest in. But is there not more money in patent hives than in bees?—Yes but that time is almost over. But how are we to know a poor hive?— It has a great many doors, drawers, hinges, craoks, crevices, nooks, and cor ners which look like conveniences, but in which the boes stiok fast. Who are the great bee-savantB of this country?—The men who don't use patent hives... Are bees profitable?—Not to those who have patent hives. Apiary Notes. One Florida apiary yielded la6t year 600,000 pounds of honey. Mb. G. M. DooXilTTbE, in The American Gleanings, contends that "queens are not injured so much by transportation in the mails, or by express, as they are by the suddou check iu egg production, that results from taking them away from full col onies in which eaoh queen is laying per haps her woight of eggs each day. Bee Journal says: We doubt the policy of removing a good queen at any time from a colony of bees. QueenlosBnoss is an abnormal condition, and should not be forced ou a colony, except for good and sufficient reasons. It would probably result in having lesg honey in the sections instead of more, and more in the brood-nest, where sur plus honoy should not be'tolerated in these days of enlightened methods of storing tho surplus honey iq neat seo," tioni oontaiaing virgin ctmib. IN the Bee-Ktepera Review, leading bee-keeper? give their views concerning the ventilation of bee depositories. They deoide that .it is unnecessary. The editor gives this summing up of the matter: Ventilation, simply lor .the sake of securing fresher or purer air, finds but littlo support while the few who plead for special ventilation, do so almost entirely upon the ground that they can hereby more readily control the temperature. Some who have been to the oxpenso of furnishing' their cellars with sub-earth and speoial ventilation, have finally abandoned it as not only usoless but injurious. If bee-reposi tories are built sufficiently underground it does not seem that ventilation would be very much needed for controlling temperature. jO'. THE DAIRY. A Profitable Cow. Prof. E. W. Stewart sayB that if a cow ouly produces 3,000 pounds of milk per annum, she is kept at a loss. A good cow, well fed, will yield 0,000 pounds of good milk, and the cost of producing this will be only one-eighth more than the :t,000. pounds from tho poor cow. Without selection of cows, and judicious feeding, dairymen cannot receivo any thing worthy of their labor. li: liuiry Note®. If von wish to produce milk, no bull should be used whose dam is not a good milker. A safe rule in feeding calves is to give just what they will lick up clean— nnd no more. It also a good rule to apply tp horses, gowk, pigs, sheop, and chickens. A poon appetite iu any farm animal iB irrMttly against doing its best, no mat te- where it is working, whether in the dairy or before the plow. Therefore, in feeding young animals, especially calves, train the appetite. Good stock is desirable, but many dairymen and farmers think they can not got the high-priced pets. The best thing, therefore, for them to do, is to select the best, take care of them, and improve their race by the use of good bull. In this way thoy will soon have good average herds. It is for the dairymen's interest to exercise as much neatness as possible in his business. Milk is one of the easiest things in the world to spoil from com ing in too noar proximity with impuri ties, and first-class butter cannot be made from such milk, and it does not pay to make butter other than first-class. Fbom experiments with ensilage, Prof. Henry, of the Wisconsin Experiment Station concludes: First, that dairy cows readily consume a sufilifc'ent quan tity of corn ensilage to maintain a flow of milk and yield of butter fully equal to and rather more than that produced by feeding dry fodder oorn. Second, that the dry matter of ensilago has not shown higher feeding valuo than the dry matter of carefully curod fodder corn. THE ULTKY-YARD. liaising DuckH. Raising ducks on limited plaoes or where they have to be shut up in coops most of the year, is not very pleasant nor profitable to the keeper but they will pay well to raise them where they can nave a foraging placo on low or marshy grounds along ditches and stroams. The cost of keeping duckR, where tho facilities are good, is merely nominal, as a large portion of then daily faro is of the coarsost and usually the cheapest kinds. Wastes from the kitchen and garden, with a little ground grain will go far towards keeping them growing during tho summerand autumn. At six months old the ducklings require an extra supply of grain and boilctl potatoes which keep them in condition for the market. It is safe to say that their flesh and feathers will average from seventy-five cents to a dollar a piece. Notes. Clover is one of the best materials that can bo fed to fowls. Five toes 011 each foot of a dressed chicken is an excellent indication of quality, as Buch are the markings of the Dorkings and Houdans. hi feeding grain to ponltry it is bettor to vary it, allowing wheat and oats as well as corn. Cooked potatoes make an agreeable change for laying hens. A light ration of meat is beneficial to fowls confined in yards, since they can not pick up the usunl supply of bugs aud worms. Hods, cut grass, and garden vegetables will all be utilized if thrown into the yards. Among tho loading breeds of domestic ducks the Aylesbury is worthy of the highest commendation. They are nn improved English product, popular in their own country and fast gaining friends among American breeders. In them the farmer, cottager, and fancier havo a large-sized bird for market or home use, and one that is remarkably hardy and productive. THE HOUSEHOLD. Dugaboon. In families wliero children are given over to the care of nurtiea to any extent, there is great danger to the nerves of the littlo people from the character of the entertuinment afforded them by the conversation of tlie nurses, whose de liRlit it often is to relate the marvellous, and to aggrandize their own importance by their assertions of thoir knowledge or personal connection with the marvel, which gives it verisimilitude. The num ber of children-who are terrified to sleep by the stories told them by nurses is something that would astound loving mothers if thoy knew it. Giants, ghosts, hobgoblins, wild beasts, unknown crea tures, and nnshaped monsters of the dark, hannt the twilight of their dreams and disturb and break tho hours of deep sleep, and nerves are discorded and lit tle brains inflamed in a way that is un guessed by those who knowlnothing of these nursery talcs. It woald bo well if every mother, when engaging nursory maids, warned them against such a prac tice under severe penalty, and took pains afterward to observe that the warning had effect. If eternal vigilance is the price of liberty in political affairs, it assuredly is in domestic ones, and thero can be no moro blessed liberty in life than freedom from tho fear and fior ror which make tho infancy of bo many nurse-ridden children intolerable. Bazar. Care of tlio Coffise-Pol. Not even milk-pans require more scrupulous care than the coffee-pot. It may oo rinsed after each timo of UBing, and yet be far from clean. Thero ig an oily property about coffee which ad heres in spite of rinsing out. You can bo,» Mils for yourself by taking almost any coffee-pot that has been somo time in use (unless it has been very carefnlly kept), and you will find clinging to it a sort of black grease (not brown) this will oome off if yon rub a cloth around tho inside. Now, this deposit, for in stance, for somo reason which I should like to have explained, destroys the fra grance, color, and flavor of coffee. If you see your coffee looks black-brown instead of ruddy brown, you will know it will be flavorleBS, however strong. To keep this blaek oil from tho pot, it must be daily washed, not rinBed,Bcalded, and dried. Each piece of a French coffee pot should be separately dried before it is pat away. If packed together wet the strainerB will, in time, givo a mo tallio taste. Another reason for great care is that without it the strainers get clogged and the coffee will not gothrougli. If you find that your coffee pot has been neglected, put a piece of crashing soda as large as a hickory nut into_ hot water set the Htrainers' in it let them stand on tho stove for hours put the same in the coffee-pot then rub and brush both till the wire gauze is clear and all tho black is removed then rnn boiling water slowly through, and dry it. Let the core be daily afterward. The grease will not form, nor will the gauze fill np if a pint or. so of boiling water is poured through every morning, uud it is dried before Doing put away. Cs!l water is worse thou useless, as it sets the oil. Soraetiineu the coffee-put is put away exoctly as it leavos the table, with left-over coffee in it.

It's most always so, too, with the case of a man who has been drowned.—Detroit Free Press. Noiwich, Conn., has the only liorse in the •world that has been up a tree. He is an old blind horse, and has passed to the stage -when it is not of much consequence to him where lie is or what he does. In hauling ice for tho Nor wich Town Woolen Company icehonse, •which is on the steep side of tho Yan tioltiver, he backed oil the twenty-five foot embankment and lodged in the upper boughs of an old elm. He rested there, easily, his fore feet dangling over ono limb and his hind legs hanging over another, while on his face was an expression that was interpreted to mean that wherever he was he was" satisfied that his job had become a better ono than hauling ico up a verticle tackle. It was not easy to tell what to do with him, and twenty men gathered about tho trunk of the elm ond thought. Somo one finally hit on an experiment. The man went aloft and fastened a ropo to the tree top, oame down, and thir teen men took hold of th& rope at a safe distance from the tree. Then a woodman went to work to fell the tree. The reBt of the party waited to see the horse and tree come down. The ohop per cut tho trunk half through the weight of the horse bore the top- down ward, the descent being graduated by tbe men at the ropes, and the animal was gracefully and safely lowered to the river ice. The horse was led around the embankment, hitched to the taokle again, and his job of hauling ice was resumed. "Stevie,"a bright 4-year-old, had been told that he muBt not ask for anything to eat when visiting tho neighbors. Soon after, at the house of a distant relative, where ho invariably found something to eat, he huug around with a wistful sort of look, until finally he broke out: "Aunt Jane, I'm awful thirsty."
