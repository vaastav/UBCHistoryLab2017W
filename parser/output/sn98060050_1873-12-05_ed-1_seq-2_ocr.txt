VIENNA KXrOSlTION. In executing llio will of Congress, as ex pressed In Its Joint resolution of tho 14th of February last, and In accordance with the provisions of tho resolution, n number of practical artlzins, of scientific men and of honorary commissioners, wero authorized to attend tho exposition at Vienna, ns com nilsslnncis on llio part of tho United Slates. It Is believed that wo have attained tho ob ject which Congress had In view when It passed tho joint resolution, In order to ena ble tho people of tho United Stales lo par ticipate In tho advantages of tho Interna tional exhibition ol'tlio products ofagricnl ture, manuraetures and lino arts, to bo held at Vienna. I tako plcasnro in adding that tlio American cxhlbltois havo received a gratifying number of medals and diplomas. During- tho Exposition n cunferenco was held at Vienna for llio purpose of consulta tion on systems prevailing In different countries for tho protection of Inventions. I authorized a representative from llio Pat ent olllco to bo present at Vienna at tho tlmo when this conference was to take place, In order to aid, as far as bo might. In securing any possible additional protection to American Inventors in Europe. It Is my pleasant duty to anuomico lo Congress that tho Emperor of China, on at taining his majority, leceivcd lliodlplomat io representatives of llio Western powers In person. An account of theso ceremonies, and of tho Interesting discussions wlilch preceded them, will bo found In the docu ments presented herewith. Tho accompanying papeis show that some advance, although slight, has been made during tho past year towards tho suppress Ion of tlio infamous Chinoso Coolie trade I iccommend Congress to cnqiilro whether additional legislation be not needed on this subject. THE

The monoy awaided to tho United Stales by the tribunal of arbitration at Geneva, was paid by Ilcr Majesty's Government a fow (lays In advanco of tho tlmo when it would havo becomo payable, according to tho terms of tho tieaty.

I renew ii recommendation mado In my mcssago of December, 1870, that Congress authorize tho Postmastor-Gcneral lo issuo all commissions to officials appointed through his department. IIHIHTSOF CITIZENS AI1I13AP. I Invito the earnest attention of Congress lo tho existing laws of tho United Stales respecting expatriation and tho election of nationality by individuals. .Many citizens of tho United Stales resldo permanently abroad with their families, under the pro visions of the act approved Februaiy 10, 1855. Tho clilldicu ol such persons aro to bo deemed and taken to bo llio citizens of tho United Stales, but the lights or citizen ship are pot to descend topcisuns whoso fathers never resided In the United States. It thus happens that poisons who never re sided In tho United Stales havo been en abled lo put forward n pretension to tho protection of the United Slates against llio claim of military scivico ol'tlio Govern ment under whoso protection Ihcy wero born and havo been reared. In some cas es, even naturalized citizens of tho United States havo returned to tho laud of their birth with tho intent to remain there, and their children, the issuo ol a marriage con tracted thero after Ihclr iclurn, and who havo never been In tho United Stales, havo laid cialm lo our protection, when tholapso or many ycais has Imposed upon them tho duly ot n military sorvlco to the only gov ernment which had over known thtfrn per sonally. Until tho year 1S0S, It was loft embarrassed by conflicting opinions or courts aud of Jurists to determine how far llio doctrine of perpetual allegiance, deriv ed from our former Colonial rotations with rent Britain, wat appllcablo to American citizens. Congress then wisely swept these doubts away by enacting that any declara tion, Instruction, opinion, order or decision ! any oluccr oi tins government wmcu icntes, restricts, impairs or questions ino lirht of expatriation Is Inconsistent with tho fundamental principles of this govern ment! but Congress did not Indicate In that statute, nor has it slnco dono so, what els aro to oe deemed to worK expairia- tlon. For my own guidance, in determin ing such questions, I required, under the provisions oi uie constitution, ino opinion n writing of tho principal oluccr In each if the executive departments upon certain questions rolallng to this subject. The le sult satisfies mc that Anther legislation has become necessary. 1 there-lorn commend the subject to tho careful consideration of Concress.

On tho 31st day or October last, whllo sailing undor tho Hag of llio United Stales on tho high sens, sho was forcibly seized by tho Spanish gunboat Tornado and was carried into tho port of Santiago do Cuba, where many of her passongors wero inhumanly, ami, so pir at icasi as re lates to thoso who wero citizens or tho Unl tod Slates, were without duo process or law put lo death. THE LAW OK THE CASE. It Is a woll oslablishcd principle, nsserled by tho United Slates from llio beginning or their national Independence, recognized by Great Britain and other maritime powers, and staled by llio Sonalo In u resolution passed unanimously on tho Kith or June, 1858, that American vossols on tho high seas, In tlmo ol' peace, bcai Ing the Ameri can Hag, remain under tho Jurlsdllclon of tlio country lo which they belong; and, thciefore, any visitation, molestation or do tcntlon or such vessel, by force or by tho exhibition or foicc, on tho part of n foreign power Is an Insult to tho sovereignly or the United Slates. OUR DEMANDS ON SPAIN. In accordanco with this principle, the restoration of tho Vlrglnlns and llio sur render of the survivors or her pessengors and crew and a duo reparation lo llio Hag, and tho punishment ol' tho authorities who bad been guilly id' llio Illegal acts or violence, wero demanded.

In taking leave of this subject for llio present, I wish lo renew tho expression of in v conviction that the cxlstenco or African shivery In Cuba is a principal eauo of the lamcntaiito condition ol ino island, l do not doubt that Congress shares wllh mo in the hopo that it will soon bo mado lodlsap- ripir. nml Ibnf imnpn nml nt-osnpi-IK in-iv follow lis abolition. The embargoing of American estates in riiim, cruelty to Amer ican citizens detected in no actor hostility to tho Spanish government, tho murdering -or prisoners taken wllh arms in their hands, and finally, the capture upon tho high seas ofa vessel sailing under the United States llag, and bearing a united stales registry, has culminate'' in an outburst or Indigna tion that lias seemed Tor a time lo threaten nar.

WHERE TO ECONOMIZE.

Thero Is n still more fruitful source or ex penditure, which I will point out later In this message. I refer lo tho easy method of manufacturing claims for losses Incur red in suppressing tho lato rebellion.

In ollhor event it Is your duty to heed tho lesson, and piovido by wlso and well considered legislation as lar as It Hos in your power against us recurrence, and to iaxo auvamago ol all benefits unit may accrued, My own iuduouiont Is that how- over much Individuals may havo Riill'crcd, ONE

Although this statement of expenditures would indicate a ma terial reduction lu amount, as compared with tlio preceding year, it is believed that changes in tho pension laws at the last session of Con gress will reach and absorb that amount during the current year. At tho close of tho last fiscal year, thero were on tho pension lists 09,801 in valid military pensioners, aud 112,08 widows, orphans, and dependent widows of deceased sol diers, making a total in that clasi of 211,892; ln.oo survivors 01 ino war 111, anu o.uoi wid ows of soldiois that was succored under an act of Congress of February 1 1th, 1871, making a to tal in that class or 23,319; 1,130 invalid navy peusiouers aud 1.770 widows and orphans, and dependent relatives of decoased otltcers, sailors, anu marines 01 1110 navy, maaing ino total 01 navy pensioners 3,200, and tho giand total of all classes of 2 H, 111, showing a net inereaso dur iug tho last fiscal year cf fi.l.U.

As a rulo, I am opposed to further donations of public land for Internal Improvements, ownod and controlled by private corporations, bu' In this instance I would mtko ono exception. Jljtwoon tlio Missouri and Itccky mountains thero Is a belt of public land from 3(H) to 500 miles hi width, perfectly Useieas for tillage from tlio want of sufficient lain to recuro the growth of anyprodncts. On Irrigating, tho Ca nal would make productive a belt as wldo as tho supply of water could bo mado to spread over across this entire country, slid would secure a cordon ot settlements, connecting tlio present populations of Iho mountain and mining regions with that of tlio other states. All hud reclaimed would bo clear gain. If alternate sections aro retained by thogovornmont, I would recommend that the retained sections bo thrown open to en try, under tlio homestead laws, or sold to actual settlors, for very low prices.

Tlio slcainor left New Ynrk for Havre, No vember 15, under command of Capl. Snr liiont. At two o'clock on Uie morning of Ihn 23d of November ulio collided Willi tho Ilrltlsh lili I,och Mam, a 1200 Ion Iron ves sel rrom London for Now York, nnd sunk shortly ortcr.

Sho was the largest sto.uner over entered nt the port of London with the exception o( llio Great Kastern, her dimensions being 430 reel by IS feet. Her carrying capacity was 3.'j(0 Ions weight. It is said that thero was ono great faull wllh her on account of her great size, ami somo delect In Ihe construction of her sleerliigapparaliis. She never answer ed her helm as readily as could bo wished, and It Is perhaps owing to this hict that sho lias now collided at tea with a nothcr vesiel and was lost. Tlio following particulars liavo been gathered rrom persins saved: Tho Vdle du Ilavio experienced a Ihli k fo3 until tl.o 20th lust., but at the time of Iho collision tho weather ,vas clear, though thoro was a heavy sea. The captain had Just retired, nnd the xecond officer was In charge. Tlio lights on tho steamer wore all right. The collision was wholly unexpected. The Loch Earn struck the slcaincr amidships, and mado a chasm 12 feet deep, and from 23 lo 30 feet wide. A panic Immediately took possession of the passenger". Five minutes alter ihe collision the main and niizzen masts fell across two of tho largo boats, which uere (Hied with peopio and roidy for launching. The lioils wero crushed lu pieces, and many of their occu pants were killed and wounded. In llio brief Interval between llio collision and tho sinking of tho steamer tho crew wero able to launch only a whole boat and the cap tain's gig. Tho rescued people do not blame Iho Loch Harn for tho cot'islon. Her olllcers and crew did their utmost tosavo lire. Tho I'rr ncli authorities at Havre have ordered an Investigation Into the- loss of tho slcmier.
