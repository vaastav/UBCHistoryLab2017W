Will Be Made the Subject of a Spe cial Message to the Sen ate Later On. •silh America Will Restore Order and AM the Islander* In Setting Up a Stable Government—War Operations and Peace tf Negotiations. Washington, Dec. 5.—The president's message was read in the house and senate this afternoon. In opening his message the president says: "To the Senate nnd House of Repre sentatives: Notwithstanding the add ed burdens rendered necessary by the war, our people rejoice in the very sat isfactory and steadily increasing de gree of prosperity evidenced by the largest volume of business ever record ed. Manufacture has been productive agricultural pursuits have yielded abundant returns labor in all fields of industry is better rewarded reve nue legislation passed by the present, congress has increased the. treasury's receipts to the amount estimated by Its authors the finances of the gov ernment have been successfully ad ministered, and its credit advanced to the first rank, while its currency lias been maintained at the world's high est standard. Military service tinder a common flag and for a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds between every section of the country. A review of the relations of the United States to other powers, always appropriate, is this year of primary importance in view of the momentous issues which have arisen, demanding in one instance an ultimate determination by arms and involving far reaching consequences which will require the earnest atten tion of congress." The president then speaks of the paragraphs in his last annual message in reference to our relations with Spain and Cuba of the futile efforts of Spain to conquer Cuba of the failure of the autonomous government, set, up in the island of the suffering of the reconcentrados and the evident inabil ity of Spain to end the war success fully. The message next takes up the de struction of the Maine, the anger which was aroused in the minds of the American people, the appointment, and work of the naval board of inquiry, which "established that the origin of the explosion was external, by a sub marine mine, and only hesitated, from lack of positive testimony, to fix the responsibility of its authorship." Continuing, the message says these things convinced the most thoughtful that a crisis in our relations with Spain and towards Cuba was at hand and it needed but a brief executive session of congress to receive an immediate an swer to the duty of making instant provision for war, and the "almost unique' spectacle was presented of the unanimous vote of both 'houses on the 9th of March appropriating $50,000,000 for the national defense.' Came None Too 8oon. The president declares this provi sion came none too soon, as our torts were practically undefended, our navy needed a large provision for increased ammunition and supplies to cope with any sudden attack from the navy of Spain, which comprised modern ves sels of the highest type of continental perfection. Our army also required enlargement, in men and munitions. Referring congress to the reports of the secretaries of wnr and the navy for details, the president says: "It is sufficient to say the outbreak of war, when it did come, found our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict." Keference is made to the apprehen sion of coming strife felt by the con tinental powers, voiced in an address to the president through their ambas sadors and envoys, and to the presi dent's reply thereto. Still animated, however, by the hope of ar peaceful so lution of the difficulty and obeying the dictates of duty, the president ret ldxed no effort to bring about a speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Nego tiations with the Madrid government proved futile, so far as practical re sults were concerned, and then it was the president presented tKe question to congress, saying: "In the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf of en dangered American interests, which give us the right and duty to speak nnd act, the war in Cuba must stop.'* Beginning of the War. The result of this statement of the case was the adoption of the memora ble joint resolution by congress, de claring the purpose of the United States to intervene between the Span iards and Cubans. Following swiftly upon the enactment of this resolution came the severance of diplomatic re lations between the two countries, the proclamation of a blockade of Cuban ports, the call for volunteers, and the formal declaration of the existence of a state 6f war. All other governments were immediately notified of the ex istence of war, and each proclaimed neutrality. "It- is not among the least gratifying incidents of the struggle that the obligations of neutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate difficulties." The president reviews at length the work of preparation for war. referring 

BRITISH PRECAUTIONS. Warship Sent to Nanking to Watch a French Cruiser. Peking, Dec. 5.—Owing to the pres ence of a French warship at Nanking, a British warship has been ordered there to protect the interests of Great Britain. The investigation of the extension of the American and British settlement* at Shanghai is likely to be fnvorably decided at an early date. Do not hit un enemy when lie is down if there is any other way to keep him down. Transport Indiana at Manila. Washington, Dec. 3.—General Otis telegraphed to the wnr department from Manila that the transport Indi ana with the headquarters and two battalions of the Kansas volunteers ar rived there Thursday morning. No deaths occurred during the voy age and there was little sickness aboard. Precautions Against Garliata. Madrid, Dec. 3.—Additional precau tions have been taken by the govern ment against the Carlista in the prov Iscec, notably Saragassa and $iseay, V£f MSi^ #l! partkmiarty to the enlistment of the volunteer*. to the material increase of (he uvjrln both inenand ships, and .to the precautionary measures taken for the protection of the seaboard cities.• The,, aggregate number uf mines placed was 1,535 in: the principal har bors, from Maine to California. Taking up chronological)} thi events of the wnr.the president re views them carefully. The first en counter was the shelling of Matanzas, on April 27. This was followed by an engagement "destined to mark a mem orable. epoch in maritime warfare."' This was Commodore Dewey's victory at Manila, May 1. "The effect of this remarkable victory says the presi dent, "upon the spirit of our people and the fortunes of war was instant. The prestige of invincibility thereby attached to our arms, which continued throughout, the struggle." The president says: "Only reluct ance to. cause needless loss of life and property prevented the early storming und capture of the city of Manila, and therewith the absolute military occu pation of the whole group." Following the memorable trip of the battleship Oregon from San Francisco to Key West and the bombardment of San Juan, Puerto Rico and the forts of Santiago, to which special reference 1b made, the president says: Tribute to Sferrimac Heroes. "The next act iivthe war thrilled not alone the henrts of our countrymen, but the world, by its exceptional hero ism. On the night of June 3 Lieuten ant Hobson, aided by seven volunteers, blocked the outlet of Santiago harbor by sinking the collier Merrimac in the channel, under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, and escaping with their lives by a miracle, but falling into the hands of the Spaniards. It was a most gratifying incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of heroes was cordially appreciated by the Spanish admiral." The campaign of Santiago,. result ing in the investment and capture of the city, is referred to as a brilliant achievement. A brief review is then presented of the decisive naval combat of the war July 3, resulting in the complete de struction of Cervera's fleet. Concern ing it the president says: "Where all so conspicuously distin guished themselves, from commanders to gunners nnd unnamed heroes in boiler rooms, each and all contribut ing toward the achievement, this as tounding victory, for which neither ancient nor modern history affords a parallel' in the completeness of the event and the marvelous disproportion of casualties, it would be invidious to single out anyone for special honor." Our lioues in the War. As to the success gained by the arms of the United States in Cuba, the presi dent says the earnest, lasting grati tude of the nation is unsparingly due, "nor should we alone remember the gallantry of the living the dead claim our tears, and our losses by battle and disease must cloud any exultation at present and teach us the awful cost of war, however rightful the cause or signal the victory." "The total casualties, killed and wounded in the army during the war with Spain was: Officers killed, 23 enlisted men killed, 257 total, 280 officers wounded, 113 enlisted men wounded, 1,405 total, 1,577. In the navy: Killed, 17 wounded, 67 died of wounds, 1 invalided from service, 6 total, 91. "It will be observed that while our navy wqe engaged in two great bat tles and numerous perilous under takings in blockade and bombard ment, and more than 50,000 of our troops were transported to distant lands and engaged in assault, siege nnd battle and many skirmishes in un familiar territory, we lost in both branches of the service a total of 1,008 killed and wounded, and in the entire campaign by latid and sea we did not lose a gun, flag, transport or ship, and with the exception of the Merrimac, not a soldier or sailor has been taken prisoner." The president pays a fitting trib ute to "the devotion of the large por tion of our army, which, although eager to be ordered to posts of great est exposure, fortunately were not re quired outside of the United States." They did their whole duty and earned the gratitude of the nation. The pres ident then says: "In tracing these events we are con stantly reminded of our obligations to the divine master for his watchful care over us,and his safe guidance, for which the nation makes reverent ac knowledgment and offers a humble prayer for a continuance of his fa vor." Peace Negotiations. The peace negotiations which fol lowed soon after the capitulation of Santiago, and the preparation and signing of the protocol are discussed at length. Referring to the work of the peace commission in Paris, the president says: "These negotiations have made hopeful progress, so that I trust to be able to lay a definite treaty before the senate, with a review of the steps leading to its signature. "I do not discuss (it this time the government or tenure of the new pos sessions which will come to the Unit ed States as a result of the war with Spain. Such discussion will lie ap propriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified. Meantime, until congress has legislated otherwise, it will be my duty to continue the mili tary governments which have existed since our occupation and give to the people security of life and property under a just nnd benefiseni rule. Independence fbr Cuba. "As soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the island, it will be necessary to give aid und direction to its people to form a gov erament for themselves. This should be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safety and assured success. It is important that our re lations with this people be of the most friendly character nnd our commercial relations close nnd reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, cncouragc the in dustry of the people and assist them to form a government which shall be free and independent, thus icalizing the best aspirations of the Cuban peo ple. "Spanish rule must be replaced by

Nei ther revenge nor passion should have a place in the new government. Until there is complete tranquillity in the island and stable governir.tnt is in augurated, military occupation w'll nc continued.'' Koreign .Relations In General. The president says that with the sin gle exception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of the United States 'with the great family of na tions during the past year lins been marked by cordiality.' Me sej-jjests the desirability of an il)termiti:iiiii! agreement regulating cubic toils. He expects to reach a hnriuouions understanding with Austriiv-lluiig.uy in the matter of the killing and wound ing of striking miners in Luzerne CJunty, Pennsylvania. Hope is expressed that the Belgian restrictions on the importation of American cattle will sobn be relaxed. The president anticipates the Niea raguan canal commission will shortly be able to make final report. He says expediency and international pol icy require the maintenance of the status quo as to the building of the canal until the commission reports and congress acts, but, in view of our newly ucquire.t interests in the Pacific, he considers the construction of this maritime highway more than ever in dispensable. Our Interests in the Orient, Considering the extraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese em pire, the president says our position among nations gives us claim to con sideration and friendly treatment in this regard, and that it will be his aim to subserve our large interests in the orient by all means appropriate to the constant policy of our. government. The president recommends an ap propriation of $1,000,000 for an exhibit at the Paris exposition. Our relations with Great Britain, he says, have continued on a most friend ly footing, and it would give him spe cial satisfaction if lie xhould be au thorized to coinmunieate to congress a favorable conclusion of pending nego tiations with Great Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. He reports that the Hawuiiuu com mission has fulfilled its mission, nnd its report will be laid before congress at an early day, and he expresses the hope that congress "will give such shape to the relationship of these mid-Pacific lands to our home union as will benefit both in the highest de gree." Cr.ar'm Disarmament Proposal. Referring to the proposal of the czar of Russia for a general reduction of great military establishments, the president says: "His majesty was at once informed of the cordial sympothy of this gov ernment with the principle involved in his exalted proposal and of the readiness of the United States to take part In the conference." The message says our new envoy to Turkey was instructed to take mean ures to dispose of matters in contro versy with the Ottoman empire for a number of years. Financial Legislation Needed. As to finances the president says: "The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources dnring the fiscal year ended June 30, 1808, including $G4, 751,223 from the sale of Pncific rail roads, amounted to $405,321,335 ex penditures, $443,368,582. "It is estimated, on the basis of the present revenue laws, the receipts of the government for the yeur ending June 30, 1899, will be $577",874,647 ex penditures, $689,974,047, resulting in a deficiency of $112,000,000. "In my judgment the present condi tion of the treasury amply justifies the immediate enactment of legislation recommended a year ago, under which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed should not thereafter be put out ex cept for gold. It, is not to be inferred that other legislation reluting to our currency is not required on the con trary, there is an obvious demand for it." Miscellaneous Recommendations. The president says, in view of the re cent acquisition of territory by the United States, there, should be estab lished regular, frequent steamship communication under the American flag with the newly acquired islands. Provision for a commission of sani tary experts to investigate the yellow fever problem is recommended. The recommendation of the secre tary, of war for an increase of the reg ular military establishment lias the president's unqualified approval. He says it.is his purpose to muster out the entire volunteer army as soon as con gress shall provide for an increase of the regular army. He recommends the erection of a building for the department of jus tice and suggests also the advisability of making proper provision for the su preme court. He earnestly approves the recom mendations of Secretary Long as to an increase of the navy, and recommends that, the grades of admiral and vice admiral be temporarily revived to be filled by officers who have especially distinguished themselves in the war with Spain. He urges legislation for the taking of the twelfth census and for the edu cation of the 30,000 white children in Indian Territory.

PICTURESQUE 0PENING„JSCENES Presence of a Number of Military Officers Gives a Dash of Color gg to the Occasion, GREAT THRONGS IN THE GALLERIES Crowd* Gather at the Capitol Early In the Day In Order to Gain sfrj^rAflMilttiinee—Goocl iSfe, Atteu- w-'A (lanee of Senators and ft sV&r1 Representatives. Washington, Dec. 5.—Congress as sembled today under circumstances of unusual public interest. The same congress, six months ago, declared war against Spain now, with the war fought and won, it reassembled for the first legislative consideration of ques tions developed by the eventful months just past. The spirit of the occasion, however, was not one of immediate ex pectancy, for the few months left to the existence, of the Fifty-fifth con gress give promise of little more thau a beginuing on the momentous prob lems and policies growing out of the war. As usual ull Washington turned its attention to the capltol for the gala event which marks the opening day of the. session. When congress convened, promptly at. noon, the galleries of both houses were crowded. There was good at tendance of senators and members. When General Wheeler came on the floor of the house he was surrounded by half a hundred members and re ceived a great ovation. A roll call developed the presence of 267 members, 179 being a quorum. A call of the senate developed the presence of sixty- seven members. The usual resolutions were offered nnd adopted. After appoining a committee to call on the president and adminis tering the oath of office to Mr. Simon, of Oregon, a recess was taken for a half hour pending the receipt of the president's message. 

SENATE'S OPENING SESSION. Many Distinguished Persons iu the Galleries and on the Flour. Washington, Dec. 5.—In the opening hours of the last session of the mem orable Fifty-fifth congress the senate chamber presented an animated scene. The galleries were filled early, many of the spectators being visitors to Washington who had embraced the opportunity to witness a congressional opening. On the senate floor the scene presented was unusually brilliant. The desks of the members were loaded with magnificent specimens of the flor ist's art. Nothing more beautiful in llornl displays hns been seen in the senate for many years. It was a ver itable chrysanthemum show, with rare roses and cut flowers of every de scription mingled with the chrysan themums, and all formed into novel and elaborate designs. Mr. Morgan, of Alabama, was the first senator to enter the. chamber, and closely following him came the octo genarian, Sir. Morrill, of Vermont. One by one the members dropped into the chamber, and the floor soon presented a scene as animated as that afforded by the galleries. Above, in the diplomatic gallery, just before the senate convened, ap peared Sir Julian Pauncefote, the Brit ish ambassador, and party, Wu Ting Fang ,tlie Chinese ambassador, and at taches of his legation, and some oilier members of the diplomatic corps. On the floor, Lord Herscheil, the chief representative of Great Britain on the joint high commission, came accom panied by T. JeiTersou Coolidgc, of Massachusetts. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Itiehurd Cartwright, Sir Louis Davis and Mr. Charlton, members of the commission, were also on the floor. Promptly on the stroke of 12 o'clock Vice President Hobnrt eutered, and, ascending the desk, rapped for order. Itev. Mr. Milburn, the venerable blind chaplain, in a profoundly im pressive manner, returned "devout and reverent thanks for God's good-, ness to us as a nation, and for his care of us since we last gathered in the chamber." "I!y thy good providence," the chap lain prayed, "triumph lias crowned our arms by land and by sea so that peace has come to us through the council chamber. Let thy grace be the" portion of our people, and may their henrts be rendered in service to thee und to all men. We pray that thy blessing may be with the queen regent of Spain and her young son, and on lier nation. May thy heavenly grace come to succor and uplift that strick en people, (iraut that all good may be given to us, to our mother laiul anil to all nations and may'we walk hand in hand with our brethren ueross the sea to the heights of Christian civil ization." At 1:25 the committee to wait on the president reported he would comnui-

"That said committee is hereby au thorized and empowered to send for books, documents, papers nnd persons and examine persons under oath, sit in any part, of the United States, em ploy a stenographer, and that the ser geant at arms is hereby directed to at tend said committee and carry out its directions. "That the neccssary expenses of the investigation be paid out ot the con tingent. fund of the house." The resolution was referred tn the committee on military affairs.

Among the cabin passengpr* are: Captain T.. nicate in writing, lind the executive clerk at once presented the message. Ifs rending began immediately, and it received the elosest attention of all. HOUSE PROCEEDINGS. GaMerles Crowded and a I-inrge At tcndancc of Members. Washington, Dee. 5.—Exactly at noon Speaker Iteed's gavel came down with a t-hnrp crack, the great ebony mucc entwined with, silver and sur mounted by a silver eagle was lifted into place upon Secretary Green's marble pedestal, the spreading folds of American flags were broken to the breeze about the brilliant stained glass ceiling, and the house of representa tives entered upon the closing session of the memorable wnr congress. The seeue within the great hall was ani mated, brilliant and picturesque. The sen Of desks within the brass mils which cut off the lobbies, spread ing in semi-circular lines from the speaker's rostrum like waves from a center, were a veritable flower gar den, a majority of the members were in their places, while the encircling galleries were banked to the doors with people. The assembling of a ses sion of congress is always a great mag net for the multitude, but the attrac tion todny was fraught with the added interest of all the memories which cling about the war congress, the tri umphs nnd reverses of the recent po litical battle at the polls mid the eagerness to hear the president's mes sage, with its review of events which have crowded the stage dnring this memorable year, and its recommenda tions of policies for the future. The public seemed to feel this was an epoch making session, and for hours before noon, a steady stream of peo ple debouched the corridors into the galleries, and even the private galler ies were crowded before the hour of convening, nnd they contained many persons distinguished in social and of ficial life. The dainty creations of millinery art and brilliantly superb gowns gave color to the picture. The members began arriving before 11 and the hall soon commenced to buzz as they exchanged greetings, congratulations or condolences. For those who had gone down at the November elections there were ex pressions of sympathy for those who had been victorious, words of congrat ulation. Some of the members had regular levees as they appeared. ThiB was remarkably true of W. A. Stone of Pennsylvania, Sir. Sayers of Texas and Mr. McMillin, Tennessee, each of whom was chosen governor of his re spective state at the recent election. Here and there throughout the throng was an officer in full uniform, an un wonted figure on the floor and a vivid reminder of the war. The floral tributes which the scurry ing pages bore into the hall and to the desks of those for whom they were de stined were much more numerous than usual. Some of them were of gigantic size, completely concealing their re cipients. There were huge baskets of roses, anchors, horseshoes and flora}' pieces of many designs. At 11:45 the floor was cleared of all those not entitled to that privilege. The leaders as a rule, were late in ar riving, but. us they appeared they were surrounded and cordially greeted. Mr. Ilitt, of Illinois, chairman of the com mittee of foreign affairs Mr. Daizell, of Pennsylvania, one of the members of the committee on rules, and Mr. Henderson, of Iowa, of the same com mittee, were each given an ovation. Mr. Dingley, the floor leader of the majority, and Mr. Bailey, the minor ity leader, came, in simultaneously from the lobbies of their respective sides. Mr. Bailey went immediately to liis sent nnd Mr. Dingley, as soon as he eould disengage himself from the friends who crowded about bim, crossed over to the democratic side nnd shook hands with his political ad versary. As the hands of the clock pointed to noon the giant form of the speaker pushed through the green baize doors of the lobby the rear of the hall nnd Mr. Reed ascended the rostrum. A wave of applause swept the floor and gnllcries upon his ap pearance. A light smile played over his benign features as he raised his gavel aloft. When that fell with a re sounding w.haclt a hush fell upon the vast assemblage. The blind chaplain stood in his place. A moment the speaker waited with every .eye riveted upon him.. Every member rose to his feet and many of those in the galleries. "The chaplain will offer prayer," an nounced the speaker in low tones. Heads were bowed reverently as the chaplain in eloquent tones invoked the divine blessing, giving praise for the victory that had attended our arms and the peace which had come, and asking for strength and wisdom to meet the new problems which con fronted the nation. At the conclusion of the chaplain's prayer the speaker announced that the lirst business in order would be a call of the roll to determine the presence of a quorum. While the responses were being made General Wheeler, of Alabama, camc in and took his seat in the row immediately in front of the speaker's rostrum. He was instantly surrounded by half a hundred mem bers and received the ovation of the day. Three new members—Charles Dick' of Ohio, Thomas Spight of Mississippi nnd W. H. Graham of Pennsylvania were sworn in. The usual committees, including onn to call on the president to notify him the house was in session, were appoint ed and a recess taken.

TO PROTECT DEPOSITORS AIMS Noteholder* Proposed Preference Neither Right Nor Expedient, He Thinks—Colonial Banking .Recommendations., Washington, Dee. 7.—The annual re port of Charles G. Dawes, comptroller of the currency, for the year ejnded Oc tober-31, 1898, has been sent So con gress. With respect to the condition of the national banks during the year, as sliown by the five reports required from the banks, the comptroller says: Notwithstanding: that the number of banks In Operation on September SO, 1S9S. Is less than at any date of report since December. 19, 1890, the amount of Individ ual deposits, loans and discounts and total resources Is greater, than at any time during the existence of the national bank ing system. On September 20, for the first time, the aggregate resources reached and exceeded the M,000,000,009 mark, the In crease since October 5. 1897, being $298,377, 337.16. A comparison of the last returns with those of October 5. 1887, indicates an Increase during the year of 1104,952,119.74 In loans and discounts. $79,194,380 In govern ment securities on deposit with the treas urer of the United States to secure cir culating notes and public deposits and the amount held by the banks 157,304,827.34 in specie and legal tenders. The reduction of $25,465,000 in the amount of tJnlted States certificates of deposits for legal tenders results In a net Increase of lawful money of $31,839,827.34. On October B, 1897, the de posits aggregated $1,863,349,128.60, and on September 26, 1898, $2,031,454,540.29, the in crease being $178,105,411.79. The balance due other banks and bankers shows an Increase of $52,027,388.09 and United States deposits of $59,023,019.27. The comptroller states that he does not review in their details the plans for the modification of the currency and banking systems which are now the subject of economic and general discussion throughout the country, but confines his discussion to the gen eral principles, underlying all of them, because they seem to ignore the inter ests of bank depositors, with whose protection the comptroller is pe culiarly charged. It is the belief of the comptroller that the proposed preference of the note holder over the depositor, which is a fundamental basis at all these plans, is not only inherently wrong and unjustified by any grounds of pub lic policy, but that its practical effect upon the present relation of deposit ors to banks in the smaller communi ties of the United States would be so revolutionary as to bring about the most injurious conditions in the gen eral business of the country The comptroller then fully discusses the claim that there is an adherent moral right, irrespective of public pol icy, to prefer a note holder over a de posit holder in the distribution af the assets of an insolvent bank and denies that such right exists. The comptroller then presents a series of tables which indicate upon what class of depositors the real bur den of this preference would fall. These tables give approximately the loss tinder which the proposed plans would result to depositors from the preference of note holders over deposit holders in case of insolvency, based upon the showing made by the 185 in solvent banks whose affairs have been finally closed during the existence of the system. The tables give these results bear ing upon the interests of depositors in banks acording to geographical sec tions and according to the following classifications of capital: Fifty thou sand dollars, $100,000, $200,000, $300, 000, $500,000 and banks with a capital exceeding $500,000. These tables, which are elaborate and lengthy, show noteworthy results. For instance, they show that: The depositors of forty-four insolvent banks, having a combined capital of $9,122,000, nominal assets $21,163,212 and with cash dividends paid depositors ot $7,996,983, or 71.61 per cent., situated 1A the middle states of Ohio, Indiana Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, lotta and Missouri, would have lost, by preference of the note holders with 100 per cent. Isbu^, 39.70 per cent, more than under the present system, or 55.44 per cent, of their dividends with an 80 per cent, note issue, 81.76 per cent, more, or 44.36 per cent of their dividends, and with a 60 per cent, issue, 23.S2 per cent, more, or 33.26 per cent, of their divi dends. The comptroller discusses at length the necessity for the establishment of international and intercolonial branch banking. He shows the disadvantages as compared With foreign trade, under which American export- and import trade now labors as a result of infe rior banking facilities and shows that these same disadvantages arc a seri ous hindrance to the adjustment of our trade relations to the new advan tages afforded by territorial expan sion. He says:' "The foundation for the greater growth of trade between the United States and her colonies must be speed ily and firmly laid in proper banking laws, which will result in enabling her merchants to do business with the people of the colonies without the dis advantages .existing at present. "Our present national, banking laws do not authorize the establishment of American international or American intercolonial banks, nor could any na tional bank establish a branch in a territory or colony such as Puerto Rico or Hawaii, even if our present laws unchanged were extended over it. $100,000 Indiana Fire.
