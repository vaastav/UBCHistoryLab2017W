gJtadfottl Towanda, Thursday, December 6,1866. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSARE. We give the President's Message, to our i- tiers, mire, to the exclusion of other matters. It. will not be found particularly interesting, the political part being a re affirmation of his former views upon the aduiissiou of Members of Congress. £he President does not mention the Con stitutional amendment, nor does he touch up' n otr > important questions now before the country. ['hose who have expected that the Presi dent would bow to the popular will, as ex pressed in the verdict at the late elections, will look in vain for any symptom of 

BUCII I\ timing reason.

F-.7 c-r!li:tns of the S- vite itrnl Ifoitse of Jirpresen tulives: After a brief interval the Congress of the United States resumes its annual legisla tive labors. An all-wise aud merciful Prov idence lias abated the pestilence which vis ited our shores, leaving its calamitous tra ces upon some portions of our country.— Peace, order, tranquility, and civil authori ty have been declared to exist throughout tin whole of the United States. In all of tin- Stat, s civil authority has superseded the coercion of arms, and the people, by their voluntary action, are maintaining their governments in full activity aud com plete operation. The enforcement of the laws is no longer "obstructed in any State 1} combinations too powerful to be sup- I -.-sed by the ordinary course of judicial p. i -endings;" aud the animosities en gendered by the war are rapidly yielding to the beneficent influences of our free in ! -itions, aud to the kiudly effects of un .. sr.ricted social and commercial inter course. An eutire restoration of fraternal !'< el ng must be the earnest wish of every patriotic heart ; and we will have accom plished our grandest national achievement when, forgetting the sa l events ot the past, and remembering only their instinctive les sons, we resume our onward career as a free, prosperous, aud united people. In my nessage oi the 4t;r of December, 1 Sos, (' -ogress was informed of the tueas ii; c - which had been instituted by the Ex ecutive with a view to the gradual resto ruii u oi the States in which the insurrec tion occurred to their relations with the General Government. Provisional Gover nors had been appointed, Conventions call ed. Governors elected, Legislatures assem bled, aud Senators and Representatives oh .• ri to the Congress of the United S 'lies. Courts had been opened for the ei.i irc.cm- ut of laws long in abeyance The blockade had been removed, custom houses r<--established, and the internal revenue laws put iu force, iu order that the people might contribute to the national income.— Pus al operations had been renewed, and efi'rts were being made to restore them to their former condition of efficiency. The States themselves had been asked to take port in the high Junction of amending the Constitution, and of thus sar.cti ming the e.v ! el ion of African Slavery as one of the h gii muitc insults of our internecine strng gle. II iviitg progressed thus far, tie- Execu tive Ik-pa. Ten-nt found thai if had accoin oU-licd in u!y a!! that was within the scope of bs Constitutional authority. One thing, !. -a ever, yet remained to be doue before tin w i kef restoration could l-e completed, and that was the admission to Congress of !. \1 S 'iiutors and Representatives f rom the steles whose people had rebelled against the lawful authority of the Genera! Gov ernment. This question devolved upon the nspective Houses, which, by the Constitu tion, are made the judges of the elections, returns, and qualifications of their own in; 'nbers ; and its consideration at once en ga-.-ed tlie attention of Congress. In Die meantime, the Executive Depart ment — no other plan having been proposed by Congress—continued its efforts to per fect, as far as was practicable, the restora tion of the proper relations between the cit zens of the respective States, the States, and the Federal Government, extending from time to time, as tiie public interests seemed to require, the judicial, revenue,and postal systems of the country. With the advice and consent of the Sen ite, the ne cessary officers were appoint, d, aud appro priations made by Congress for the pay ment I their salaries. The proposition to • amend the Federal Constitution, so as to prevent the existence of slavery within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction, was ratified by tiie requisite number of States ; and on the Isth day of December, 18G5, it was officially declared to have become valid as a part *f the Con stitution of the United States. All of the Stat* s in which the insurrection had exist ed promptly amended their Constitutions, so a- to make them conform to the great ch-.nge thus effected in the organic law of tlu- land ; declared null and void all ordi iianci s and laws of secession; repudiated all pretend, d debts and obligations created for the revolutionary purposes of insurrec tion ; and proceeded, in good faith, to the enactment of measures for the protection and amelioration of the condition of the col ored race. Congress, however, yet hesitat ed to admit any of the States to represen tation ; and it was not until the close of the eight month of the session that an ex ception was made in favor of Tennessee, by the admission of her Senators and Rep- | reseutatives. I deem it a subject of profound regret I that Congress has thus fur failed to admit j loyal Senators aud Representatives from the other States, whose inhabitants, with 1 those of Tennessee, had engagedjn the Re-' hellion. Ten States—more than one-fourth I of the whole number—remain without rep-1 resentation : the seats of fifty members in \ the House of Representatives and of twen- ! ty members in the Seriate are yet vacant— i not by their own consent, not by a failure 1 o' election, but by the refusal of Congress ' to accept their credentials. Their admis- ! sit n, it is believed, would have accomplish- i ed much towaid the renewal and strength-! ening of our relations as one people, and removed serious cause for discontent on j llie part of the inhabitants of those States, i It would have accorded with the great prin ciple enunciated in the Declaration of American Independence that no people ought to bear tiro burden of taxation, and yet be denied the right of representation. It would have been iu consonance with the express provisions of the Constitution that 1 "each State shall have at least one Repre sentativo," and " that no State, without its consent, shall bo deprived of its equal suf frage in the Senate." These provisions were intended to secure to every State, and to the people of every State, the right of representation in each House of Congress ; and SJ important was it deemed by the framers of the Constitution that the equali ty of the States in the Senate should btt preserved, that not even by an amendment of the Constitution, can any State, without its consent, be denied a voice in that branch of the National Legislature. It is true, it has been assumed that the existence of the States was terminated by the rebellious acts of their inhabitants, and that the insurrection having been suppress ed, they were thenceforward to be consid ered merely as conquered territories. The Legislative, Executive and Judicial De partment of the Government, however,with great distinctness and uniform consistency, refused to sanction an assumption so in compatible with the nature of our republi can system, and with the professed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legis lation of Congress the undeniable fact makes itself apparent, that these tun polit cal communities are nothing less than States of the Union. At the very commence ment of the Rebellion, each House declar ed, with a unauimity as remarkable as it was significant, that the war was "not waged, upon our part, in any spirit of op pressiou, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrow ing or interfering with the rights or estab lished institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursu ance thereof, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired ; and that as soon as these objects" were "accom plished, the war ought to cease." In some instances, Senators were permitted to con tinue their legislative functions, while in other instances Representatives were elect ed and admitted to seats after their States had formally declared their right to with draw from tne Union, and were endeavor ing to maintain that right by f'oice of anus. All of the States whose people were in in surrection, as States, were included in the apportionment of the direct tax of $20,000,- 000 annually laid upon the United States by the act approved August 5, 1861. Con gress by the act of March 4, 1862, and fv the apportionment of representation there under, also recognized their presence as States in the Union ; and they have, for ju dicial purposes, been divided into districts, as States alone can be divided. The same reeoguitiou appears in the recent legisla tion in reference to Tennessee, which evi dently rests upon the fact that the functions of the State were not destroyed by the Re bellion, but merely suspended; and that principle is, of course, applicable to those States which, like Teunessee, attempted to renounce their places in the Union. Tee action of the Executive Department of the Government upon this subject has been equally definite and uniform, and the purpose of the war was specifically stated in the Proclamation issued by my prede c ssor on the 22d day of September, lsu2. It was then solemnly proclaimed and de clared that "hereafter, ss heretofore, the war will bo prosecuted fur the object of practically restoring the constitutional re lati-n between the United Slates and each of the States and the people thereof, in j which States that relation is or maybe sus pended or disturbed." The recognition of the States by the Ju dicial Department of the Government has also been clear and conclusive in all pro ceedings affecting them as States, in the Supreme, Circuit, and District Courts. In the admission of Senators and Repre sentatives from any and all of the States, there can be no just ground of apprehen sion that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation ; for this conld not happen when the Constitu tion and the laws are enforced by a vigi lant and faithful Congress. Each II >nse is made the "judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications > f its own members," t and may, " with the concurrence of two | thirds, expel a member." When a Senator j or Representative presents his certificate I of election, he may at once be admitte t or | rejected ; or, should there be any question ! as to eligibility, his credentials may be re ferred for investigation to the appropriate committee. If admitted to a seat, it must be upon evidence satisfactory to tie' House of which he thus becomes a member, that he possesses the requisite constitutional and legal qualifications. If refused admis sion as a member for want of due allegi ance to the Government, and returned to his constituents, they are admonished that none but persons loyal to the 1 nited States will be allowed a voice in the Legislative Councils of the Nation, and the political power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty to the Government and fi leiity to the Union. Upon this question, so vitally affecting the restoration of the Union and the permanency of our present form of gov ernment, my convictions,heretofore express ed, have undergone no change ; bu , on the contrary, their eorrectnesss has been con firmed by reflection and time. If the ad mission of loyal members to seats iu the respective Houses of Congress was wise and expedient a year ago, it is no less wise and expedient now. If this anomalous con dition is right now—it, iu the exact condi tion of these States at the present time, it is lawful to exclude them from representa tion, I do not see that tiie question vviii be changed by the efflux of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of representation will be no stronger —the right of exclusion will lie no weaker. The Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the President to n c ommend to the consideration of Congress " such measures as he shall judge necessa ry or expedient." I know of no measure more imperatively demanded by every con sideration of national interest, sound poli cy, and equal justice, than the admission of loyal members from the now unrepre sented States. This would consummate the work of restoration, and exert a most salutary influence in the re-establishment of peace, harmony and fraternal feeling. It would tend greatly to renew the confidence of tlfe American people in the vigor and ' stability of their institutions. It would bind us more closely together as a na tion, and enable us to show to the world 1 the inherent and recuperative power of a ! Government founded upon the will of the j people* and established upon the principles of liberty, justice and intelligence. Our in 1 creased strength and enhanced prosperity - would irrefragably demonstrate the fallacy of rhe arguments against free institutions drawn from our recent national disorders : by the enemies of republican government, j The admission of loyal members from the States now excluded from Congress, by al-1 laying doubt and apprehension, wonld turn capital, now awaiting an opportunity for 1 investment, intd the channels of trade and i industry. It would alleviate the present troubled condition of those States, and, by j inducing emigration, aid in the settlement of fertile regions now uncultivated, and i lead to an increased production of those staples which have added so greatly to the j wealth of the nation and commerce of the world. New fields of enterprise would be opened to our progressive people, and soon tin; devastations of war would be repaired, and all traces of our domestic differences effaced from the minds of our countrymen. In our efforts to preserve "the unity of Government which constitutes us one peo ple," by restoring the States to the condi tion which they held prior the lebellion, we should be cautious, lest, having rescu- ; ed our nation from perils <J threatened dis integration, we resort t> b<>m-"lidatiou, aud in the end absolute despotism, as a remedy for the re-cnrrence of similar troubles The war having terminated, a.id witn it all oc casion for the exercise oi pow rs of doubt ful constitutionality, we should hasten to bring legislation within the boundaries pre scribed by the Constitution, aud to return to the ancient landmarks established b\ i our fathers for the guidance of succeeding generations. " The Constitution which at any time exists, until changed by an ex plicit and authentic act of the whole peo ple, is sacredly obligatory upon all." " If, in the opinion of the people, the distribu tion or modification of the constitutional powers, be, in anji particular, wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way !in which the Constitution d< -signates. But | let there be no change by usurpation for [ " it is the customary weapon by which free i Governments are destroyed." Washington I spoke these words to his countrymen,when, | followed by their love and gratitude, he I voluntarily retired from the cares of public I fife. 'To keep in all things within the pale I of our constitutional powers, and cherish tee F deral Union as the only rock of safe ty," were prescribed by Jefferson as rules of action to endear to his " countrymen the trne principles of their Constitution, aud | promote a union of sentiment and action j equally auspicious to their happiness and j safety." Jackson lie-Id that the action of ' the General Government should always be I strictly confined to the sphere of its appro priate duties, and justly and forcibly urged that our Government is not to be maintain ed nor our Union preserved " by invasions of the rights and powers of the several States. In thus attempting to make our | General Government strong, we make it ! weak. Its true strength consists in leaving individuals and States as much as possible to themselves ; in making itself felt, not in its power, but in its beneficence ; not in us control, but in its protection ; not in binding the States more closely to the cen tre, but leaving each to move unobstructed in its proper constitutional orbit." These I are the teachings of men whose deeds and I srevices have made them illustrions, and ! who, long since withdrawn from the scenes | of life, have left to their country the rich ! legacy of their example, their wisdom, and ! their patriotism. Drawing fresh inspiration ! from their lessons, let us emulate them in love of country and respect for the Consti tution and the laws. The Report of the Secretary of the Treas ury affords much information respecting the revenue and commerce of the country. His views upon the currency, and with inf erence to a proper adjustment of our reve nue system, internal as well as impost, are ! commended to the careful consideration of ' Congress. In rny last Annual Message 1 | expressed my general views upon these ; subjects. 1 need now only call attention I to the necessity of carrying into every De partment of the Government a system of rigid accountability,thorough retrenchment, and wise economy. With no exceptional nor unusual expenditures, the oppressive burdens of taxation can be lessened by | such a modification of our revenue laws as i will be consistent with the public faith,and ! the legitimate and necessary wants of the ! Government. The report presents a much more eatisfac -1 tory condition of our finances than one year i ago the most sanguine could have antici pated. During the fiscal year, ending the i 30th June, 180-5, th.- last year of the war, the public debt was increased $941,902,- 531, and on the 31st of October, 1865, it i amounted to $2,740,854,750. On the 31st I day of October, 1866, it had been reduced j to $2,551,310,008, the diminution, during a ! period of 14 months, commencing Septeui ! iier 1, 1865, and ending October 31, 1806, having been $200,379,565. In the last au- I nual report ol the state of the finances, it 1 was estimated that during the three quar- I ters of tiie fiscal year ending the 30th of .June last, the debt would lie increased ' $112,194, 387. During that period, howev- I or, it was reduced $31,190,387, the receipts of Die year having been $89,905,509 more, and the expenditures $200,529,235 less than the estimates. Nothing could more clearly indicate than these statements the extent and availability of the national re sources and the rapidity and safety with whicli under our form of government, great military and naval establishments can be disbanded, and expenses reduced from a . war to a peace looting, i During the fiscal year ending the 30th of .Tune, 1860, the receipts were $558,032,020, ; and the expenditures $520,750,948, leaving |an available surplus of $37,281,080. It is J estimated that the receipts for the fiscal I year ending the 30th June, 1867, will be $475,061,386, and that the expenditures will j reach the sum of $310,428,078, leaving iu the Treasury a surplus of $158,633,308. — For the fiscal* year ending June 30, 1868, it is estimated that the receipts will amount to $436,000,000, and that the expenditures will be $350,247,041 —showing an excess of $85,752,359 in favor of the Government.— These estimated receipts may be diminish ed by a reduction of excise and import du ties ; but after all necessary reductions shall have been made, the revenue of the present and of following years will doubt less be sufficient to cover all legitimate char ges upon the Treasury, and leave a large annual surplus to be applied to Die pay ment of the principal of the debt. There seems now to be no good reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country advan ces in population and wealth, and yet tin debt be extinguished within the next quar ter of a century. The report of the Secretary of War fnrn -1 ishes valuable and important information in reference to the operations of his Depart ment during the past year. Few volunteers now remain in the service, and they are be ing discharged as rapidly as they can be replaced by regular troops. The army has been promptly paid, carefully provided with medical treatment, well sheltered and subsisted,and is to be furnished with breech loading small arms. The military strength of the nation has been unimpaired by the discharge of volunteers, the disposition of unserviceable or perishable stores, aud the retrenchment of expenditury. Sufficient war material to meet any emergency has been retained, and, from the disbanded vol unteers standing ready to respond to the national call, large armies can be rapidly organized, equipped, and concentrated.-- Fortifications on the coast and frontier have received, or are being prepared for more powerful armaments ; lake surveys and har bor and river improvements are in course of energetic prosecution. Preparations have been made for the payment of the ad ditional bounties authorized during the re cent session of Congress, under such regu lations as will protect the government,from iraud, and secure to the honorably-dischar ged soldier the well-earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantry. More than six thousand maimed soldiers have received ar titic it limbs or other surgical apparatus ; and forty-one national cemeteries, contain ing- too remains of 104,526 Uuion soldiers, have already been established. The total estimate of military appropriations is $25, 205,669. It is stated in the report of the Secretary of tin- Navy that the naval force at this time consists of 278 vessels, armed with 2,351 guns. Of these, 115 vessels, carrying 1,029 guns, are iu commission, distributed chielly among seveu squadrons. The number of men iu the service is 13,600. Great activ ity wid vigilance have been displayed by all the squadrons, and their movements have b. en judiciously and efficiently arranged iu sucli tii iiui i us would best promote Ame n<- commerce, and protect the rights and iutert si d our countrymen abroad. The vessel.-* unemployed are undergoing repairs, or ar> laid iu> until their services may be required. Most of the iron-clad lleet is at League Island, in the vicinity of Philadel phia, a place which, until decisive action should be taken by Congress, was selected by the Secretary ol the Navy us the most eligible location for that class of vessel's ! It is important that a suitable public eta tiou should be provided for the iron-clad fleet. It is intended that these vessels should be in proper condition for any emer gency, and it is desirable that the bill ac cepting League Island for naval purposes, which passed the House of Representatives at its last session, should receive final ac tion at an early period, in order that there may be a suitable public station for this class of vessels, as well as a navy-yard of .area sufficient for the wants of the service, on the Delaware river. The Naval Pension t fund amounts to $11,750,000, having lu en increased $2,760,000 during the year. The expenditures of the Department for the fisi [ cal year ending 30th June last were $43, 328,526, and the estimates for the coming j year amount to $23,568,436. Attention is invited to the condition of our seamen, and ■ the importance of legislative measures for their relief and improvement. The sugges \ tions iu behalf of this deserving class of onr ' fellow-citizens are earnestly recommended to the favorable attention of Congress. The report of the Postmaster Genera! i presents a most satisfactory condition of i the postal service, and submits recomnnu -1 dations which deserve the consideration of I Congress. The revenues for the Depart ment for the year ending June 30, 1866, were $14,386-,086, and the expenditures $b r >, 351,079, showing- an excess of the latter of $965,003. In anticipation of this deficien cy, however, a special appropriation was made by Congress in the act approved July 28, .866. Including the standing appro priation of $700,000 for free mail matter, as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet remaining unexpended, the actual deficien cy for the past year is only $265,093 —a sum within $51,141 ot the amount estima ted iu the annual report of 1864. The de crease of revenue, compared with the pre vious year, was one-fifth per cent, and the increase of expenditures, owing principally to the enlargement of the mail service in the South, *as twelve per cent. On the 30th of June last there were iu operation ! six thousand nine hundred and thirty maii I routes, with an aggregate length of ue i hundred and eighty thousand nine huudrt d and twenty-one miles, an aggregate annual transportation of seventy-one million eight hundred and thirty-seven thousand nine hundred and fourteen miles, and an aggre gate annual cost,including all expenditures, of $8,410,184. The length of railroad routes is thirty two thousand and ninety-two miles, and the annual transportation thirty million six hundred and nine thousand foar hun dred and sixty-seven miles. The length of steambrtat routes is fourteen thousand three hundred and forty-six miles, and the annual transportation three million four hundred and elevi n thousand nine hundred and six ty-two miles. The mail service is rapidly increasing throughout the whole country, i and its steady extension in the Southern i States indicates their constantly improving j condition. The growing importance of the I foreign service also, merits attention. The ! Post-Office Department of Great Britain and our own have agreed upon a preliminary basis for a new Postal Convention, which it is believed will prove eminently beneficial to the commercial interests of the United States, inasmuch as it contemplates a re duction of the international letter postage to one-half the existing rates ; u reduction of postage with all other countries to and from which correspondence is transmitted in the British mail,or in closed mails through the United Kingdom ; the establishment of uniform and reasonable charges lor the sea and territorial transit of correspondence in closed mails ; and an allowance iu each Post-Office Department of the right to use all mail communications established under the authority of the other for the dispatch of correspoudenc, either in open or closed mails, on the terms as those applicable to the inhabitants of the country providing the means of transmission. The report of the Secretary of the Inte rior exhibits the condition of those branch es of the public service which are commit ted to iiis supervision. During the last fis cal year, 4,029,312 acres oi public laud were disposed of, 1,892,516 acres of which w ere entered under the Homestead act.— The policy originally adopted relative to the public lands has undergone essential modifications. Immediate revenue, and not their rapid settlement, was the cardiual fea ture of our land system. Long experience and earnest discussion have resulted in the conviction that the early development of our agricultural resources,aud the diffusion of a energetic population over our vast ter ritory,are objects of far greater importance to the national growth and prosperity than the proceeds of the 6ale of the land to the highest bidder in open market. The pre emption laws confer upon the pioneer who complies with the terms they impose the privilege of purchasing a limited portion of "uuoffered lauds" at the minimum price.— The homestead enactments relieve the set tler from the payment of purchase mosey, arid secure him a permanent home,upon the condition of residence for a term of years, j This liberal policy invites emigration from the old,and from the more crowded portions of the new world. Its propitious results are undoubted, aud will be more signally manifested when time shall have given to it a wider development. Congress has made liberal grants of pub lic land to corporations in aid of the con struction of railroads and other internal improvements. Should this policy hereaf ter prevail, more stringent provisions will be required to secure a faithful application of the fund. The title to the land should not pass, by patent or otherwise, but re main in the Government and subject to its control until some portion of the road has been actually built. Portions of them might then, from time to time, lie conveyed to the coporation, but never in a greater ratio to the whole quantity embraced by the grant than the completed parts hear to the entire length of the projected improvement. This restriction would not oberate to the preju dice of any undertaking conceived in good faith and executed with sonable energy, as it is the settled practice to withdraw from market the lands falling within the opera tion of such grants, and thus to exclude the inception of a subt-equrnt adverse right.— A breach of the conditions which Congress may deem proper to impose should work a forfeiture of claims to the lands so with drawn hut uucenveyt'd, and ol title to the lauds c< nveyed which remain unsold. Operations on the several lines of the Pa cific Railroad have been prosecuted with unexinipled vigor and success. Should no unforeseen causes of delay occur, it is con fidently. anticipated that this great thur oughfare will be completed before the expi ration of the period designated bv Congress. During the last fiscal year the amount paid to pensioners, including the expenses of disbursement, was $13,457,91)6, and 50,- •177 name* were added to the pension rolls. The entire number of pensioners, June 30, 1800, was 126,722. This fact furnishes melancholy and striking proof of the sacri fices made to vindicate the c authority of the Federal Government, and to maintain inviolate the integrity of the Union. They impose upon us correspond ing obligations. It is estimated that $33,- 000,000 will be required to meet the exigen cies of this branch of the service during the next fiscal year. Treaties have been concluded with the Indians who, enticed into armed opposition to our Government at the outbreak of the Rebellion, have unconditionally submitted to our authority, and manifested an earnest desire for a renewal of our friendly rela tions. During the year ending September 30, 1866, s,7I(J patents for useful iuvehli us ! and designs were issued, and at that date I the balance in the Treasury to the ere lit of ' the Patent fund was $218,207. ■ As a subject upon which depends an irn ! mense amount of the production and com ! merce of the country, I recommend to Con gress such legislation as may be uccess u y ; for the preservation of the levees of the ! Mississippi river. It is a matter of national j importance that early steps should be taken not only to add to the efficiency of these ! barriers against destructive inundations, : but for the removal of all obstructions to the free and safe navigation of that great channel of trade and commerce. Toe District- of Columbia, under existing I laws, is not entitled to that representation ! in the National C .iiucds which, from our earliest history, has been uniformly accord ed to each Territory established from time to time within our limits. It uiaintaius pe | cuiiar relations to Congress, to whom the j Constitution lias granted the power of exer cising exclusive legislation over the seat of government. Our fellow-citizens residing iu the District,whose interests are thus con fided to the special guaruainship of Con gress, exceed in number the population of several of our Territories, and no just n i sou is perceived why a delegate of their choice should not be admitted to a so at in the House of Representatives. No modo seems so appropriate and effectual of ena bling them to make known tin ir peculiar condition ami wants, and of s< curing the local legislation adopted to them. I there fore recommend the passage of a law au thorizing the electors of the District of Col umbia to choose a delegate, to be allowed | the same righ's and privileges as a dele j gate representing a Territory Tin- increas ing enterprise and rapid progress of im ' provcinent iii the District are highly grali i lying, and I trust that the efforts of the municipal audi untie to promote the pros perity of the national n.etivp dis v iii re ceive the efficient and generous coup ration of Congress. It is a subject of congratulation that uo foreign combinations against our domestic peace and Safety, or our legitimate influ ence among the nations, have been formed or attempted. While sentiments of recon ciliation, loyalty and patriotism have in creased at home, a more just consideration of our national character and rights lias been manifested by foreign nations. The entire success of the Atlantic Tele graph between the coast of Ireland and the Province of Newfoundland is an ach ievement which has been justly celebrated iu both hemispheres as the opening of an era in the progress of civilization. There is reason to expect that equal success will attend, and even greater results follow, the enterprise for connecting the two Con tinents through the Pacilic Ocean by the projected line of telegraph between Kaui schatka and the Russian Possessions in America. The resolution of Congress protesting against pardons by foreign Governments ol persons convicted oi infamous offences, on condition of emigration to our country, has been communicated to the States with which we maintain intercourse, and the practice, so justly the subject of complaint on our part, has not been renewed. The congratulations of Congress to the Emperor of Russia, upon his escape from attempted assasiuatiou, have been present ed to that humane and eulighteued ruler, and received by him with expressions of grateful appreciation. The Executive, warned of an attempt by Spanish American adventuaers to induce the emigration of freediuen of the United States to a foreign country, protested against the project as one which, if con summated, would reduce them to a bond age even more oppressive than that from which they have just been relieved. Assur ance lias been received from the Govern ment ot the State, in which the plan was matured, that the procei ting will meet its encouragement nor approval. It is a question worthy of your consideration whether our laws upon the subject are ad equate to the prevention or punishment of the crime thus meditated In the month of April last Congress is aware, a friendly arrangement was made between the Emperor of France and the President of the United States for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French ex peditionary forces. This withdrawal was to he effected in three detachments,the first of which, it was understood, would leave Mexico in November, now past, the second in March next, and the third and last in November, 1807. Immediately upon the completion of the evacuation, the French Government was to assume the same atti tude of non-intervention, in regard to Mex ico, as i • held by the Government of the United States Repeated assurances have been given by the Emperor, since that agreement, that he would complete the promised evacuation within the period men tioned, or sooner. It was reasonably expected that the pro ceedings thus contemplated would produce a crisis of great political interest in the Republic of Mexico. The newly-appointed Minister of the United States, Mr. Camp bell, was therefore sent forward, on the 9th day of November last, to assume his prop er functions as Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to that Republic It was also thought expedient that he should be attended in the vicinity of Mexico by the ' Lientenant-General of" the Army of the United Mates, with the view of obtaining such information as might be important to determine the course to be pursued by the United States in re-establishing and main taining necessary and proper intercourse with the Republic of Mexico. Deeply in-' terested in the cause of humanity, it seem- j e<l mi obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever influence we possess.-d bid the restoration and permanent crtablishtm nt in that country of a domestic and repnb lieau form of government Such wan the condition of nfl.iirs in re gard to Mexico,when on the 22d of Novom ber last official information v.-as receiv •' from Paris that the Emperor of France had sonic time before decided ii"t to witlnltav. a detachment of his forces in the month of November past, according to engagement, but that this decision was made with the purpose of wtyhdi awing the whole of those forces in the ensuing spring Of this de termination, however, the 1 nited States had not received any notice or intimation ; and, 80 soon as the information was receiv ed Ly the Government, care was taken to make known its dissent to th" Emperor of France. I cannot foregoe the hope that France will reconsider the subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the evacua tion of Mexico which will conform as ncar -1 ly as [practicable with the existing cngage ! mcnt, and thus meet the just expectations ; tf the United States. The papers relating ! to the subject will be laid before you. It is believed that, with the evacuation of Mexico by the expeditionary forces, no I subject for serious differences between France and the United States wpiubl re main. The expressions of the Emperor | and people of France warrant a hope that ! the- traditionary frieudsbip between .the two countries might in that case be re j newed and permanently restored. A claim of a citizen of the United States i for indemnity for spoliations committed on ! ihe high seas by the French authorities, in 1 the exercise of a belligerent power against i Mexico, has been met by the Government | of France with a proposition 1o defer settie j ment until a mutual convention for the ad I justinent of all claims of citizens and sub- I jects of both countries, arising out of the j recent wars on this Continent, shall be agreed upon by the two countries. The suggestion is not deemed unreasonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct the manner in which claims for indemnity by foreigners, as well as by citizens of the United States, arising out of the late civil ! war, shall be adjudicated and determined, j I have no doubt that the subject of all ! such claims will engage your attention at | a convenient and proper time. It is a matter of regret that no consider j able advance has been made towards an i adjustment of the differences between the United States and Great Britain, arising j out of the depredations upon our national ! commerce and other trespasses committed ' by British subjects, in violation ot inter i national law and ti uty obligations. The . d—lay, however, may be believed to have rci-ultod hi no small degree from the do ne-.-lie situation of Great Britain. An i entire <-iiange of ministry occurred in that j country during the last session of Parlia ment The attent on of the new ministry ] was called to 'he subject at an early day, and there is some reason to expect that it ! will now be r msidercd in a becoming and friend y spirit. The. importance of an ear ' ly disposition • f rlie question cannot be ex aggerated. Whatever ui'ght be the wish i es of the Governments, it is manifest that j good-will and friendship between the two I countries cannot be established until a re j ciprucity, in the practice of good-faith and , neutrality, shall be restored between the , respective nations. On the oth of June last, in violation of ; our neutrality laws, a military expedition j and enterprise against the British North j American Colonies was projected and at (tempted to be carried on within the terri ' tory and jurisdiction of the United States, t In obedience to the obligation imposed up j OD the Executive by the Constitution, to : see that tin* lews are faithfully executed, all citizens were warned, by proclamation, ; against taking part in or aiding such un j lawful proceedings, and the proper civil, military, and naval officers were directed ; to take all necessary measures for the en j forcemeat of the laws. The expedition j lulled, but it has not been without its paiu ! ful consequences. Some of our citizeus 1 who, it was alleged, were engaged in the j expedition, were captured, and have been ' brought to trial, as for a capital offense, ]in the Provirce of Canada. Judgment ! and sentence of death have been pronounc j od against some, while others have been acquitted. Fully believing in the maxim of Government, that severity of civil puu ishment for misguided persons who have j engaged in revolutionary attempts which | have disastrously failed, is unsound and j unwise, such representations haviug been ! made to the British Government, in behalf | of the convicted persons, as, being sustain !ed by an enlightened and humane judgment, will, it is hoped, induce i i their cases an exercise of clemency, and a judicious amnesty to all who were en gaged in the movement. Counsel has been employed by the Government to defend citizens of the United States ou trial for capita! offences in Canada ; and a discon tinuance of the prosecutions which were instituted in the courts of the United States against those who took part in the expe- I dition, has been directed. I have regarded the expedition as not I only political in its nature, but as also in a i great measure foreign from the United j States in its causes, character, and objects. | The attempt was understood to be made in ! sympathy with an insurgent party in Ire ; land, and, by striking at a British Province j on this Continent was designed to aid in ■ obtaining redress for political grievances I which, it was assnm d the people of Ire -1 land had suffered at the hands sf the Brit ish Government during a period of several centuries. The persons engaged in it were chiefly natives of that country, some of whom had, while others had not, become citizens of the United States under our general laws of naturalization. Complaints of misgovernment in Ireland continually engage the attention of the British nation, and so great an agitation is now prevail ing in Ireland that the British Government have deemed it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in that country. These circumstances must necessarily modify the opinion which we might otherwise have en tertained in regard to an expedition ex pressly prohibited by our neutrality laws. So long as those laws remain upon our statute-books, they should be faithfully ex ecuted, and if they operate harshly, un justly, or oppressively. Congress alone can apply the remedy, by their modification or repeal. Political and commercial interests of the United States are not unlikely to be affec- 1 ted in some degree by JJevents which are transpiring in the eastern region* of Eu-1 rope, and the time seems to have come, when our Government ought to have a proper diplomatic representation in Greece. This Government has claimed for all per-! sons not convicted, or accused, or suspect ed of crime, an absolute political right of self-expatriation, and a choice of new na tional allegiance. Most of the European States have dissented from this principle, and have claimed a right to hold such of their subjects as have immigrated to and been naturalized in the United States, and afterwards returned on transient visits to j their native countries, to the performance I of military srrviei* in like manner an ri>si • icn subjects. Complaints arising from th- claim in thi- respect made by Foreign S'a'• : 'vi- h.-ietofore been matters "if l onui'versy between the United Stat'-s im| some of the European Powers, n !r- ... i"' 1 ' uon m ipient upon the failun- n, * . t . ill 'hi- quest I HI increased during the war iii w ell l'i u.-> ii, Italy, and Austria wi re lec-nily engaged While Great Britain has never acknowledged the right of expa triation, she has not practically insisted upon it. France has been equally forbear ing ; and Prussia has proposed a compro mise, which, although evincing increased liberality, has not been accepted l>v the 1 nited States. Peace is now prevailing everywhere in Europe, and the presold seems to be a favorable time for an asser tion by Congress of the principle, so long maintained by the Executive Department, that naturalization by one State fully eX ernpts the native-born subject of any other State from the performance of military ser vice under any foreign Government, HO long as he does not voluntarily renounce its rights and benefits. In the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the Constitution, 1 have thus submitted to the Representatives the States and of the People such information of our domestic and foreign affairs as the ' public interests seera to require. Our Gov ernment is now undergoing its most trying ■ ordeal, and rny earnest prayer is, that tin* | peril may be successfully and finally pass ed, without impairing its original strong h I and symmetry. The interests of the nation j are best to be promoted by the revival of | fraternal relations, the complete oblitera tion of our past differences, and the re in augnration of all the pursuits of peace I Directing our efforts to the early
