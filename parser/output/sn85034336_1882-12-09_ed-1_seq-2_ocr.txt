The two houses of Congress met Monday in regular annual session. The meeting appears to have been characterlsed by no unusual Incident, nor did it call forth more than the in terest'usual on the assembling of Con gress. If there be an exception, it wouly refer to the election of Speaker of the next Congress. The several as pirants for this high position are re ported to have shown marked atten tion to the members re-elected. The Washington correspondent of the Times-Democrat reports the names of these gentlemen as follows: Randall, Carlisle and Cox, who are mentioned in connection with the Speakership of the next House, were particularly sociable. Somebody re marked that they must have rosin on their hands; they held on to their friends with such a firm, friendly grasp. Although the election for Speaker is a year off, everybody is talking about it. Even the candidates are posing and laying their wires. Randall Is working for the place with all the adroitness and vigor for which he is famous. He makes no move that is not intended to be toward the Speakership. Just at present his strongest opponent is Carlisle, and he is doing what he can to create the im pression that Carlisle is a free trader. It is said by the same correspondent of members of the Senate that they ap peared glad to meet again after their vacation, and that very nearly all the Senators were present, those from this State included. 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. It would require an hour to peruse attentively the annual message of President Arthur. It is, in the main, a bussines document, and remarkable for nothing of a belligerent or partisan nature. The President opens with a review of the foreign relations of the United States, from which it appears that this government is involved In no serious trouble with any foreign power. The President passes next to the con sideration of the matter of finances. We will follow the President's views with bearings on the more Important matters treated of in his message, leaving comments with the reader. 

INTERNAL REVENUE AND Tn.Allr F. Upon the showing of our financial condition, also of the last fiscal year, I feel justified in recommending to Con gress the abolition of all revenue taxes except those on tobacco in its various forms, and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors, and except also special taxes upon manufacturers or dealers in such articles. I venture now to suggest that unless it shall be ascer tained that the expenditures of the Government for coming years have been underestimate'd, all Internal taxes save those which relate to distilled spirits, can be prudently abrogated. Such a course, if accompanied by a simplication of the machinery of col lection which would then be of easy accomplishment, might be reasonably expected to reduce the cost of such col lection by at least $2,500,000, and in the retirement from office of from 1,500 to 2,000 persons. * * * A total abolition of excice taxes would almost invariably prove a serious, if not an unsurmontable obs tacle to a thorough revision of the tariff, and to very considerable reduc tion in import duties. The present tariffsystem is, in many respects, un just. It makes unequal distributions both of its burdens and its benefits. This fact was practically recognized by a majority of the Act creating the Tariff Commission. * * It the tax on domestic spirits is to be retained, it is plain, therefore, that Slarge reductions from the custums re venue are entirely feasible. While recommending this reduction, I atim far from advising abandonment of t lhe policy of so discriminating in the ad justment of details as to afford pro tection to domestic labor, but the present system should be so revised as to equalize the public burden among all classes and occupations, and bring it into close harmony with the present needs of industry. Without entering into minute details, which under present circumstances, is quite un necessary, I recommend an enlarge ment of the free list so as to Include within it the numerous articles which yield inconsiderable revenue; a sim plification of the complex and incon slstent shedule of duties upon certain manuuacturers, particularly those of cotton, iron ond steel, and a substan tial xreduction for the duties upon thoseartcles and upon sugar, molasses, silk, wool and woolen goods. MISSISsPPI I 

RIVER fIMTROVEMENT. It is apparent by this exhibit that so far as concerns meaet of the items to which the Actof Augut, 1882 related, there ea be no need of further appro priatibons until after the close of the presemat session. If, however, any ac tion seems to be necessary in respect to particular objects, It will be entirely t possible to provide for those objects by appropriate legislation. It is possible, for example, that to delay until the as- 4 sembling of the next Congress to make e additional provisions for the Mississip pi river improvement might be attend ed with serious consequences. If such 4 should appear to be the case, a just bill relating to that subject would com mand my approval. POSTAL CHANGES. As matters which may fairly claim particular attention, I refer you to the Postmaster General's observation in re ference to the advisibllity of changing of the present basis for fixing salary and allowances; of extent of the money order system, and of enlarging the functions of postal establishment so as to put under its control the telegraph system of the country, though from this last and most important recommenra tion I must withhold my concurrence. At the last session of Congress several bills were introduced in -the House of Representatives far the reduction of letter postage to the rate of two cents per half ounce. I have given much study and reflection to this subjects, and am thoroughly persuaded that such a reduction will be for the best interests of the public. 

CIVIL SERTICE REFOIM. Referring to suggestions made by the President on this subject he says : There has been no legislation upon the subject to which they relate, but there has been an increase in the pub lic interest on that subject, and the people of the country; apparently with outdistinction of party, have, in vari ous ways and upon fr, quent occasions, given expression to their earnest wish es for prompt and definite action. In my judgment such action should no longler be postponed. I may add that mny own sense of its importance has been shown by observations of the practical phase of the matter to which attention has more than once been called by my predecessors. I trust that before the close of the present session someo decisive action may be taken for the correction of the evils which attach to the present me thods of appointment, and I assure you of my hearty co-operation In any mess ures which are likely to conduce to that end. 

POLI'PICAL ASSESSMENTS. I declare my approval of such legis laoion as may be found necessary for supplementing the existing provisions of law in relation to political assess ments. In July last I authorized a public announcement that employees of the Government should regard themselves as at liberty to exercise their pleasure in making or refusing to make political contributions, and that their action in that regard would in no manner affect their official statue. In this announcement I acted on views Which I had always maintained and still maintain, that a public officer should be as absolutely free as any other citizen to give or to withhold a contribution for the aid of the political party of his choice. It has, however, been urged, and not without founda tion in fact, that by solicitation of offi cial superiors and by other modes such contributions have at times been ob tained from persons whose only mo tive for giving has been the fear of what might befall them if they refus ed. It goes without saying that such contributions are not voluntary, and in my judgment their collection should be prohibited by law. A bill which will effectually suppress them will receive my cordial approval. SOUTIIERN HIISTORICAL SOCIETY. Editor Natches Democrat: I have just read the closing volume of "i Martin's Popular History of France." It is a continuation of Guizot's IIlstory, and closes with an account of Mac-Mallon's resignation of the office of President of the French Republic in 1878, and the installation of Mr. Jules Grevy. This work, as translated from the French, is publish ed in Boston. It is beautifully printed and illustrated, its style is captivating and altogether it is highly interesting and must needs be generally read. Al ready it lihas been distributed to thou sands ofsutbscribets in our own coulIntry, and it is reasoInable to suppose that it will find its way into public and private librairies, and be regarded its history by readers in all civilized countries. 1 give you below some extracts froiun the third volume, to show the pre's sing uecessity for the dissetnmiation of the licts touching the late civil war, that the South may have justice and a fair hearing the world over. The The Hlistorical Societe aimts to nuleet this necessity, and will do it if we are true to ourselves, to the illustrious dead, the brave survivors of the armies, to our wives and children. The author, writing to the inter ference of the federal governement in Mexican affaais just after the close of our civil war, says: "cThe South, thanks to the leisure which slavery gave her, was far more given to politics thtan the North; and although very inferior in numbers, the Southern people had hithlerto held public office and the reins of govern ment, far more frequently than those of the North. The North at least re acted against this preponderance ; the slavery question let loose the dog of war. Popular feeling in the North, on this point, agreed with popular in terest. Aside from political jealousy and manufacturing greed, religious and philosophical principles were brought powerfully to bear, and the men de voted to the abolition of slavery formed a party whose sincerity was in contestible, and whoso energy was un-i daunted. The whole world was shaken by the tragic story of John Brown, that martyr of liberty, hung by slave owners for preaching the enfran chisement of the blacks. * * * The North e would fain have avoided civil war; the S~outh hurried it on, and took the offeusive. Two Southern States, Vir ginia, the home of Washington, and Maryland, refused to be led astray, and saved the seat of the federal City of Washington by remaining loyal to the union. "The South nevertheless had the ad vantage at first. Nearly all the offcers of the small Federal army belonged to her, and she was far belter prepared for the war than was the North. "The Northerners were not people to be discouraged by a few defeats. They squandered men and money in Cyclo pean efforts unceasingly renewed. They improvised an army; they improvised with the free help of individuals, an admirable organization for the succor of the wounded and sick of their army. This indomitable nation extemporised every thing. * * * Early in 1804 the South seemed lost. She revived temporarily, by a des perate effort. A relentless Dictatorship converted every inch of ground left her into one vast camp. The Southern government waged a truceless and re lentless war, trampling under foot all law, all justice, all humanity."-Vol. 3, pp. 4167-8 9-70. The Italics are mine. And this is history ! Shall it be unchallenged ? Shall the grandest Christian heroes of modern days. Gens. Sydney Johnston, Jackson, Davis and their compeers, and the gallant armies that fought with them for a cause they believed to be just, be handed down to posterity as barbarians, such ias Attain, Genghis, Khan or Hyder Ali. "WVaging a truce less and relentless war; trampling un der foot all law, all justice, all hlumani ty ?" So it will be if we lie idle. And the murderer of Harper's Ferry be exalted into "ta martyr of liberty," while the Spartan like soldiers of. the South whose feet were often shoeless, whose clothing was in shreds, whose haver sacks were empty, but whose courage was undaunted-whose catridge boxes were full and their bayonets always bright, will be doomed to an immor tality of infamy. 

WILL T. MIARTIN, Vice President, So. Hist. Sec. for Mississippi. November 18th, 18S2. NEW YORK PAPERS ON TIIE PRESI DENT'S MESSAGE. [Heorald] If the Republicans had at the last session of Congress taken Mr. Arthur's message as the guide of their action if they had framed and adopted such legislation as he recommended, and there rested-it is now clear to most of them that they would have saved themselves the mortifying defeat of last month. They return to Washling ton depressed, and rightly so, for they have been made to feel the just anger of the people. [Tilhe Star.] The President's Message shows that -he has heard of the recent elections in the count:y and understands their meaning. He has profited by the tre mendous rebuke given his party by the people, and he has incorporated in his message many of the ideas on whichll the Democracy made their appeal to the people. LWorld.] The President does not venture to defend the "principle of protection." In repeating the Democratic definition of tihe objects of taxation, he gives up the Republican case. The Democrats hlave now the acquiescence of the offi cial head of tile Republican party in the Democratic doctrine of tile tariff. It is colceded that we must have a tariff for revenue only. Let the Demo crats stand quietly on the principle that revenue is to bte collected by the tariff only, and stand ready to appeal o the country against the party which totains tile abuses of tile internal re renue inll order to protect the l:buses of Vhe tariff.

ORIGIAN.-THIE ABDUCTED MASON. Cul. Simeon B. Jewett of Clarkson' Major Samuel Barton of Lewiston, and John Whitney of Rochester passed that evening at my house. Jewett was prepared to testify that he furnish ed a carriage for those who were con veying Morgan secretly from Cana daigua to Niagara. John Whitney was one of the party. 1Major Barton would have testified that he furnished the carriage which conveyed the party from Lewiston to Fort Niagara, John Whitney being one of that party. Whitney would havesworn that Gould supplied money to enable him to "es cape from justice." In the course of the evening, the Morgan affair being the principal topic of conversation, Col. Jewett turned to Whitney with em phasis and said: "John, what if you make a clean breast of it." Whitney looked inquiringly at Barton, who added: "Go ahead-" Whitney then related in detail the history of Morgad's abduction and fate. Theiidea of suppressing Mor-. gan's intended exposure of the secrets of Masonry was first suggested by a man by the name of Johns. It was discussed in lodges at Batavia, Le Roy and Rochester. Johns suggested that Morgan should be separated from Mil ler and placed on a farm in Canada West. For this purpose he was taken to Niagara and placed in the magazine of the fort until arrangements for set tling him in Canada were completed, but the Canadian Masons disappointed them. After several meetings of the lodge in Canada,opposite Fort Niagara, a refusal to have anything to do with I Morgan left his "kidnappers" greatly perplexed. Opportunely a Royrl Arch chapter was installed at Lewiston. The occasion brought a large number of enthusiastic Masons together. "Af ter labor," in Masonic language- they "retired to refreshment." Under the exhilaration of champaigne and other viands, the Chaplain (the Rev. F. II. Cummings of Rochester) was called on for a toast. IHe responded with pecu liar emphasis and in the language of their ritual. The enemies of our order -May tlhey find a grave six feet deep, six feet long, and six feet due east and west." Immediately after that boast, which was received with great enthus iasm, Cuol. William King, an officer in our war of 1812, and then a member of Assembly from Niagara county, called Whitney of Rochester, HIoward of Buffalo, Chubbuck of Lewiston, and Garside of Canada out of the room and into a carriage furnished by Major Bar ton. They were driven to Fort Nia gara, repaired to the magazine, and informed Morgan that the arrange ments for sending him to Canada were completed, and that his famnily would soon follow him. Morgan received the information cheerfully, and walked with supposed friends to the boat, which was rowed to the mouth of the river, where a rope was wound around his body, to each end of whiich a sinker was attachled. Morgan was then thrown overboard. lie grasped the gunwale of the boat convulsively. Garside, in forcing Morgan to relin quish his hold, was severely bitten. Whitney, in concluding his narra tive, said he was now relieved from a heavy load; that for four years he had not heard the window rustle or any other noise at night without thinking the Sheriff was after him. Col. Jewett looking fixedly at Whitney, said : i "Weed can hang you mnow." "But he won't," was Whitney's prompt reply. Of course a secret thus confided to me was inviolably kept, and twenty-nine years afterward, whileattending a Na tional Republican Convention at Chi cago, John Whitney, who then resided there, called to say that he wanted me to write out what he once told me about Morgan's fate, to be signed by him in the presence of witnesses, to be sealed up and published after his death. I promised to do so before * leaving Chicago. There was no leis ure, however, during the sitting of the Convention, and even before its final adjournment, forgetting what I had told Whitney, I hurried to Iowa, re turning by way of Springfleld to visit Mr. Li'ncoln. In the excitement of of the canvass which followed, and the secession of the Southern States upon Mr. Lincoln's election, I neglected the important duty of securing the confes sion \Vhitney was so anxious to make. In 1IS61 1 went to Europe, and while in London wrote a letter to WVhitney arking him to get Alex. 13. Williams, then a resident of Chicago, to do what I had so unpardonably noglected. That letter reached Chicago one week after WVhitney's death, closing the last Iand only chalnce for the revelation of that important even!. Whitucy was a mason by trade,hlon est, industrious, sober, but excitable. In all the early stages of the Morgan affatir lie believeld lie was doing his duty. The final crime was committed und'-r the clrncunlstalncls I have related. Blen Perlcy I'oore wrote to the Bos. ton Journal concerning T'iurlow Weed's disclosure about thel death of Morgan, as follows: "'hten ill Smuyrna, some- forty years ago, I gathered a great deal of infor mnation about a mysterious American, who Ihad colme there soon after the Morgan excitement. IHe received quarterly remittances, and finally these were stopped. Were I disposed to give hearsay statements, I think that I could show that the mysterious Sstranger was iNorgan, wvho was paid liberally by the Anti-Miasons to absent hiimself, but whlo hoped after some years had elapsed to return to the State of New York; but I cannot Sprove the statement, anld my own oath would not make may statements of what I saw, heardt, antl read legal evi dence."
