WHAT TAFT'S NEXT MESSAEG WILL CONTAIN. It Is stated upon excellent author ity that prominent among the sug gestions for legislation to bo made by President Taft In his forthcoming message to congress will bo tho following: First To authorlzo the interstate commerce commission to Institute In quiry relaUvo to Interstate commcrco matters and to fix rates on Its own Initiative instead of limiting Its func tions to tho making of rates only af ter complaint has been mado. Second To require interstato rail roads to furnish written statements of rates In forco when so requested by shippers. Third To require railroads to al lor Interstato shippers of freight to quote their own freight over connect ing lines. Fourth To vest the Interstato com merce commission with power to chango freight rate classification as well as rates. Fifth Federal control over stock Issues so that rallwny companies or corporations will not bo allowed to lssuo stocks and bonds unUl after they have mado application to tho In terstate commerce commission, so that tho government may know for what purpose stocks and bonds are issued, the uses to which they aro to bo put, and to seo that these issues aro for legitimate and useful purpos es other than for manlpulaUon; also. to cnablo tho commission to bear theso facts In mind when detcrrnln lng tho earning power and other fac tors connected with tho establishment of rates. Sixth To vest tho commission with power to proveut Interstate railroads from puchaslng stock control of own ershlp in compotlng lines. Seventh To creato an Interstato commerce court of probably G mem bers to sit in Washington as a special tribunnl to consider appeals from do clslons and tho rates mado by the commission, this court to bring nbout ultimately the evolution of an inter state commerco codo and uniform transportation Judicature. Eighth To so amend thu law ns to eliminate certain methods that havo been in vogue for crantlnir nf rebates, especially those based on en larged, or flcUtious claims for dam ages. Ninth-rTo write nrovislon fntn ih law to bring about tho enforcemont nf tho so-called "lone and short hmii clause" so amending the law as to lomia tbe charging of more for a short than for a long haul over the samo line or route Tenth Tho creation of somo form of commission, or possibly a subdi vision under tho control of the com- mission, for tho purpose of bringing anout the simplification of rate mak ing sheets, which aro now so com- plex that many of the railroad-men tnemselves do not understand them. Eleventh To change tho law so as to make tho granting of rebates a separate offense for each shipment. Rather than havo them go before a congressional committee and mako war on the proposed amendments to the interstato commerce laws, Presi dent Taft is consulting various big railway chloftans with a view to net- Ung their endorsement of tho plans. He has already had conferences with James J. Hill of the Great Northern, W. C. Brown of the New York Cen- tral and Edward P. Ripley of tho Santa Fo. The president believes that ho can havo tho railroad managers friendly to his program, he can get tho war ring factions in congress united upon it and can havo it put through at tho coming session. Mr. Drown is now sounding railroad men and endeavoring to get thorn to agree on a program of legislation nlong lines favored by tho president. The chief featuro of the president's program to which tho railroads ralso objection is tho proposal to prevent a road from owning stock in a com peting lino. A. S. Harkett, of West Hickman, pays the highest market price for all kinds of furs. You Who Spend Twice for Fuel What You Should Bursa oil coal, hard coal or wood.
