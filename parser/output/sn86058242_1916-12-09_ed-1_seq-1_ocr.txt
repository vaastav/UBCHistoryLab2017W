The personality of David Lloyd George is for many rea sons interesting and "important to the United States. He is one of the fw Britisn statesmen understanding the difnrulty and intangible psychology. He is important to America for another reason. He is now the head of the five British nations engaged in war Brit ain, Canada. Australia. New Zealand and South Africa together with India. AVinning of the war now primarily de volves on these nations. If they and the allies are beaten it will be America's turn next, for Ger-rr.-iiiy's plans in South America and Germany's hatred of the United States should be known to every American who reads the anti-American propagan da Df the German government. Events made him prime minister a position as powerful as that of your president. But his desire was that this flistlnction' should be conferred on an other. Indeed, for some hours it looked as though it would be the Scotchman, Honar Law, rather than the Welshman Lloyd George. He went out into the wilderness alone, so far as his own par ty was concerned. He had as a sup- opposed him on practically every phase of politics, and an outside helper in Sir Carson, whose Irfth policy was dia metrically opposite. These three with Lord Derby, have produced a miracle whereof ajl the world Is talking. In a few days they have formed a government marred it Is true by inclusion of some notable former failures, but enriched by tha brains of business men and new politi cians. At the beginning of the week his po litical opponent did not seem able to make a government. Now they think it won't last. I hold a different opin ion. I believe he will be . tia head of the -government that wins the war.
