President Cleveland's nisseage, read in Con eress to-dav. opens with a tender al lusion to the recent death of Vice President Hendricks and reference to his distinguished public services, integrity and devotion to duty, A general survey shows that our relations with foreign powers con tinues to be friendly. There are no questions of difficulty pending with any foreign government. Allusion is made to the appointment of Mr. Kellv as Minister to Austria and re jected by that country. Tbe rea sons advanced by Austria asking for the withdrawal of Mr. Kelly were such as could cot be acquies ced in bv the President without violating his oath of office. He has made no new nomination and the interests of the Government at Vienna are now in the care of the Secretary of Legation. Concerning an Isthmian ehip canal, the President says the inter ests of the United States in a practi cal transit for ships across the Isth mus has been repeatedly manifested during the last half century, and whatever highway may be construc ted across the barrier must be for ike world's benefit, a trust of man kind,to be removed from the chance of domination by any single power; uor shall it become a point for invi tation for hostilities, or a prize for warlike ambition. Toward such re alization the efforts of his adminis tration will be applied. The Chinese question in the Wes tern States, despite restrictive legis lation, is far from satisfactory ; but aJl the power of the Government should be exerted to maintain the utmost good faith toward China in the treatment of emigrants from that country. On the fishery question the Presi dent recommends that Congress pro vide for a commission in which the government of the United States and Great Britain shall be represented, charged with the settlement of the entire question of the fisheries rights of the two countrits. He urges legislation to make the recently concluded commercial trea ty with Mexico effective. Of international copyright he says action is certainly desirable to bring about the object in view. The inadequacy of legislation touching citizenship and naturaliza tion is brought to the attention ot Congress. It is important that the right of alien domicil as distin guished from Federal naturalization be defined. He urges a recast of appropria tions for the consular and diplomat ic service on a footing commensur ate with the importance of our na tional interests, and advocates a sys tem of consular inspection. In reviewing tbe reports and rec ommendations ol bis cabinet officers. the President first takes up the re- 1,8 rf 8ult m be 8 public beneht,are port of Secretary Manning and dis- reminded by the President that his cusses the tariff and currency and b,riT demonstrates that the point is coinage question. On the tariff he easily reached in the attempt to float savg. at the 6ame time two sorts of money The fid that our revenues are in i ot different excellence when the bet- excess of the needs of an economical administration of the government justifies a reduction in the amount exacted lrom the people for its sup port Our government is but the means established by tbe will of a free people, by which certain prin ciples are applied which they have adopted for their benefit and pro tection ; and it is never better ad ininir4ered and its true spirit is never better observed than when the people's taxation for its support is scrupulously limited to the actual necessity of expenditure and distri buted according to a just and equit able plan. The profosition with which we have to deal is the reduc tion of tbe revenue received by the Government and indirectly paid by the people for custom duties. The question of free trade is not involv ed, nor is there now any occassion for the general discussion of the wisdom or expediency of a protec tive system. Justice and fairness dictate that in any modification of our present laws relating to revenue, the industries and interests which have been encouraged by such laws, and in which our citizens bare large investments, should Dot be ruthless ly injured or destroyed. e should also deal with the sub- jec in such a manner as to protect not he wisely settled upon or per the interestsof American labor.which ;sisted in without considering the al ls the capital of our workingmen : titude on the subject of other conn its stability and proper remunera-i tries with whem we maintain com- tion furnish the most justifiabla pre-j mercial relations. The attitude of text for a protective policy. Within j the leading Powers remains substan tbese limitations a certain reduction j tially unchanged since the monetary should be made in our customs rev-i conference of 1 SSI, and tbe steps enue. ihe amount of such reduc- tion having been determined, the in-! quiry follows : Where can it best be remitted and what articles could" best be released from duty in tbe in-' terests of our citizens ? I think the 1 set 

ESTABLISHED 1827. SOMERSET, PA., WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 16, 1S85. reduction should be made in tbe revenue derived from a tax upon the important necessaries of life. We thus directly lessen the cost of liv ing in every family of tbe land, and release to the people in every bum ble home a larger measure of the re wards of fugal industry. Nothing more important, the President says, than the present condition of our currensy and coin age, can claim the attention of Con gress. The very limited amount of circulating national bank notes, compared with the amount the law permits them to issue, indicates that the volume of circulating medium may be largely increased through this instrumentality. On the silver question he says the authority to coin money given to Congress by the Constitution, i f jit permits the purchase of bullion for tbe coinage, in ny event does not justify coinage t j an extent beyond the amount needed for a sufficient circulatibg medium. The dsire to utilize the silver product of the country should not lead to a misuse or the perversiou of this power. The necessity of such an addition to the silver currency a3 compelled by the Silver Coinage act, he says. is the government in regard to silver jan(, with as little irritation as pos negatived by the fact that up to the coinage would be speedily changed j gig gut 0f courSe no relaxation present time only about 50,000,000 by the act of Congress. Prosperity ' 0f tne principle which underlies it of the 215,OU0,0O0 silver dollars coin ed since 1S7S have found their way into circulation, leaving more than 105,000,000 in the possession of the Government, the custody of which has entailed considerable expense for the construction of vaults for its deposit. Against this latter amount there are outstanding silver certifica tes amounting to about 893,000,000. Every month $2,000,000 or more of silver dollars are added to the idle mass already accumulated. If con tinued long enough this operation will result in tbe substitution of sil ver for ali the gold the Government owns applicable to its general pur poses. It will not do to apply the customs receipt of the Government to make good this drain of gold, be cause the 6ilver thus coined having been made legal tender for all debts and dues, public and private, at times during the last six moiiths S percent, of the receipts for duties rave been in silver or silver certi ficates, while the average within that period has been 20 per cent. The proportion of silver and certificates received by the Government w'll probably increase as time goes on, for the reason that tbe nearer the period approaches when the Gov ernment will be obliged to offer silver ia payment of its obli gations, the greater the inducement will be to hoard gold against depre ciation in the value ol silver, or tor the purpose of speculating. This hoarding of told has already been begun, and when the time comts that gold ha? been withdrawn from circulation, tnan will be appar ent the difference between the real value of the silver dollar and a dol lar of gold, and the two coins will part company. Gold still the stand ard of value, and necessary in our dealings with other countries, will be nt a premium over silver; banks which have substituted gold for the deposits of their customers may pay th m with silver bought with such gold, thus making a handsome prof it ; rich speculators will eell their hoarded gold to their neighbor?, who need it to liquidato their foreign debts at a ruinous premium over silver, and the laboring men and woinen of the land, most defenseless of all, will find that the dollar re ceived for the wage of their work has sadly shrunk in purchasing power. It may be said that the latter re sult will be but temporary and that ultimately the price of labor will be ad justed to the change ; but even if this takes place, -.the wage-worker cannot gain but must inevitably lose, since the price he is compelled to pay for his living will not only be measured in a coin heavily dep recated and flucuating aud uncer-j tain its value, but this uncertainty in the value of the purchasing me-! dium will be made the pretext for an advance in price beyond that justified by actual deprecation. Those who do not fear any dis astrous conseauences arising from the continued compulsory coinage of silver and who supposed that the addition to the currency intended as ter will cease to be in general circu lation, bo it silver coinage be con tinued we may reasonably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon the field ot circulation to! silver alone, and this may produce unyielding plan of action to their a eevere contraction of the currency varied and varying needs and cir instead of addii g to it. The fact cumstances. He recommends the that while there, have been special j passage of a law authorizing the ap tfforts of the Secretary of the Treas- pointment of six commissioners, ury to increase silver circulation, a i three of whom shall be detailed from large share of the limited amount the army, to be charged with a care- put out has soon returned to the I Trnasury in the payment of duties, leads to the belief that the people do not now desire to keep it on hand, and this, with the evident disposi tion to hoard gold, gives rise to the suseicion that there already exists a laek of confidence among the peo ple touching our financial processes. There is certainly not enough silver no win circulation to cause uneasi ness, and the whole amount coined and now on band might after a time be absorbed by the people without apprehension ; but it is the ceaseless stream that threatens to overflow the land that causes fear and uncer tainty. Leaving considerations of a home nature in the discussion of this sub ject, the President says a line of ac tion m regard to our currency can- taken to secure the adaption of ai common international ratio between gold and silver, demonstrates the uselessness of further attempts at present to arrive at any agreement on the subject with other nations. In the mean time we are accumnlat- ine silver coin based on our own peculiar ratio to such an extent as will render us an undesirable party to any future monetary conference cf nations. Returning to a discussion of the question at home.tbe President says we have now on hand all the silver dollars necessary to supply the present needs of the people and to satisfy those who from Fentiment1 wish to see them in circulation. If; their coinage is suspended they can be readily obtained by all who de sire them ; if tbe need of more is at any time apparent coinage can be renewed. The President discusses the silver question exhaustively, devoting more space to it man to any oiner, subject in his message, and closes discussion with the following words: commissioners as to the character of "That disaster has not already over-j tne examination and many other taken us furnishes no proof thatjmaUers connected with its execu danger does not await upon acon-)tiOD. Thus the rules and regulations tinuation of the present silver coin- !acl0pted by the commission have age. We have been saved by tueimuch to do with the practical use- mosi careiui management acu unus - ual expedients, by a combination of loriunaie conuuiont ana uy a conn dent expectation that the course of rests upon our thresnoid oecause oi dangers and uncertainties surround ing this question. Capital timidly shrinks from trading and investors are unwilling to take chances of tbe Questionable shape in which their money will be returned to them, while enterprise halts at a risk against which care and sagacious management do not protect As a necessary consequence labor lacks employment, and suffering and dis tress are visited upon a portion of our fellow-citizens, especially enti tled to the careful consideration of those charged w ith duties of legis lation. No interests appeal to useo 6trongly for a safe and stable curren cy as the vast army of the unem ployed." Iieviewing the report of the Sec retary of War, the President recom mends reform in court-martial pro ceedings, a remedy to the present dtftuceless condition of our sea coasts and a law prohibiting the con struction ot bridges over our navi gable rivers in such a manner as to obstruct navigation. Referring to our navy he express es the hope that the day is not far distant when we will have a navy which befits our standing among na tions, but before we proceed further in the restoration of tbe navy we need a thoroughly reorganized navy department li we desire to build ships f it present usefulness, instead of naval reminders of days that are past, we must have a department or ganized for work. He earnestly commends the portion of Secretary Whitney's report devoted to this subject to the attention of Congress in the hope that his suggestions touching the reorganzatio.i of the Navy Department may be adopted as the first step toward the recon struction of our navy. Of postal affairs he says that the anticipated and natural revival of postal revenues has been oppressed and retarded by the unfavorable bus iness condition of the country, of which the Postal Service is a faith ful indicator. The gratifying fact is shown, however, by the report of the Postmaster General, that our return ing prosperity is marked by a gain of 380,000 in the revenue of the latter half of the past year over the correspond:!'1!' period of the preced ing year, and he confidently antici pates that after a short period of re awakened prosperity, by proper economy even the present low rates, now as favorable as any country af fords, will be adtquate to sustain the cost of the service. Of ocean subsidies he thinks that if Euch gift of the public money is to be made for the purpose of aid ing any enterprise in the supposed interest of the public, the amount to be paid and the beneficiary should be determined by Congress. The President endorses the plan suggested by the Attorney General in his report for remedial legislation to relieve the overburdened Courts of the United States, and favors pay ing United States marshals and dis trict attorneys salaries instead of compensation by fees. Of the Indian question, the most difficult subject in charge of the In terior Department, he feels satisfied some proeress may be noted in the condition of the Indian. There seems, he says, to be a general con currence in the propsition that the the ultimate object in the treatment of the Indian should be their civili zttion and citizenship. No attempt should be made to apply a fixed and ful inspection of aU the Indians up- on our reservations or subject to the care and control of the Government, with a view of discovering their ex act condition and needs and deter mining what steps shall be taken on behalf of the Government to im prove their situation in the direc tion of their self support and com plete civilation ; to ascertain which, if any, of the reservations may be reduced in area, and what part, not needed foi Indian occupation, may be purchased by the Government from the Indians and disposed of for their benefit ; what, if any, Indians may, with their consent, be removed to other reservations with a view of their concentration and the sale on their behalf of their abandoned res ervations ; what Indian lands, now held in common, should be allotted in severalty ; in what manner and to what extent the Indians upon the r3servations can be placed under the protection of our laws and sub jected to their penalties; and which, if any, Indiana shouM be invested with the right of citizenship. He commends to tbe attention of Congress the recom mendations of Secretary Lamar with reference to the reneai. and modification of cer tain land laws. I Of polygamy he says there is no feature of it or the system which sanctions it, which is not opposed to all tnat is of value in our instita tions. There should be no relaxa tion in the execution of the law now in operation, and he will gladly ap prove of lurther discreet legislation which will rid the country of the blot upon its fair feme. Of Civil Service reform the Presi dent is inclined to think that there : ;s no sentiment more ceneral in the minds of the people of our country than a conviction of the correctness of the principle upon which the law enforcing Civil Service reform is bas ed. In its present condition tbe law regulates only a part of the subordi nate public positions throughout the country. It applies the test of fit ness to applicants lor tnese places hv means of a competitive examina- ! .inn. and o-ivps lnnre discretion to the jfujQess 0f the statute and with the rei.ult of application. The people mav wf 11 trust the commission to pTPrtitf th law with nerfect fairness and no weaker.ing of the safe-guards which surround it can be expected Experience in its administration will i 1 1 a i . r j prouauiy sugepi nujeuuiiieui ui lit methods ot execution, but he ven tures the hope that we shall never again be remitted to the system which distributes public positions purely as rewards for partisan ser vice. The allurement of an im mense number of offices and posi tions exhibited to the voters of the lend, and the promise of their be stowal in rocognition of partisan ac tivity, debauch the suffrage and rob political action of its thoughtful and deliberate character. The evil would increase with the multiplication of offices consequent upon the exten sion and growth of the country. Civil Service reform, he says, came none too soon to check the progress of political demoralization. One of the minor but important recommendations of the President is prompt action by Congress to se cure proper accommodation and protection for the Capitol library. II is last recommendation, immedi ately preceding the closing para- paoo oi nw message, ""'"8 -l .il: . : lumrui... ait.H.uin.t u. - remtincr tn lh ProBiilpnti.il RtircpH- the Presidential succes sion. The message concludes with the following words : "In conclusion, I commend to the wise care and thoughtful attention of Congress the needs, the welfare and the aspirations of an intelli gent and generous nation.' To sub ordinate these to the narrow advan tages of partisanship or the accom plishment of selfish aims is to vio late the people's trust and betray the people's interests. But an indi vidual sense of responsibility on the part of each of us, and a stern de termination to do do our duty well must give us place among those who have added in their day and gener ation to the glory and prosperity of our beloved land." Same aa Other Folks. Bank robbers have their hours of sorrow and disappointment as well as other folks. Three of the frater nity lately planned to rob a bank in a little village in Wisconsin, and the first thing on the programme was to get the cashier out of bed and make him open the vault After a great deal of trouble they succeeded in affecting an entrance to his dwell ing, but when they came to his bed room they found only his wife and child. Rousing up the woman, they asked her where her husband was. "Are you officers of the law ?" she queried. "No, ma'am ; we are bank rob bers." . "Sorry for you. gentlemen, if that is the case. William started for Canada five hours ago." "But the keys of the vault?"' "They went with him." "Then we'll have to break open the vault"' "No use in that. All the money went with Wiiliam.

Since that time not a nail has been driven and, with the exception of a little whitewashing, nothing has been done in tbe line of repairs. Once when Judge Blank was on the bench I dropped into the court room to pass an idle hour. The Solicitor-General had just !cal!ed the Judge's attention to an indictment against one Jefferson Orton. . The charge was assault with intent to murder, but the Solicitor said that be was satisfied he could not secure a conviction, and he theretore rec ommended that the indictment be nol pros'd. The Judge frowned, and remarked in his sternest tones: " I take a different view of it, Mr. Solicitor. It would be reducing jus tice to child's play to do as you sug- cest. Ihe case will be called alter dinner, and it will be tried unless a proper showing is made for a continuance- His Honor's tartness caused a lit tle stir. The Solicitor turned red. and there was a breeze of whisper ing all over the court-room. In the afternoon I was on hand to witness the trial of Orton. To the surprise of everybody, it did not come ot!. After taking his seat Judge Blank, with an embarrassed look, san! : u Mr. Solicitor, I believe you stat ed this morning that you were in fa yor of having the Orton case nol pros'd ?" "Yes, may it please Your Honor," replied the Solicitor ; " but of course, if in your judgment " "Never mind, about that," inter rupted the Judge ; I am satisfied that you must have good grounds for making such a recommendation. Let the matter be disposed ofasjou suggested." There was a buzz of surprise for a I moment. Other business engaged attention, and the matter was soon orgotten. I had no interest in the case, and yet I could not help won ering what caused the Judge to l l" change bis mind. 1 lound out about it long afterward. Wfc fa c adjourned .. .. . . BUJuuullu for dinner on the day when these events occurred, Judge Blank went straight to a little barber shop, and throwing himself into a chair, called for a I shave. There was only one barber! in the establishment, and he was a I white man. He had a villainous face, and bis build showed him to be a man of great strength. When he recognized his customer, a pecul iar look came over his face. He stepped to the door, and glanced up and down the street. It was cold and sleety, and not a soul was to be seen. He closed the door, and pro ceeded to attend to his work He lathered the. Judge's face carefully, and then took up his razor. "Jedge," said he, " I 'spose yer dunno me !" No," answered the Judge, curtly. "My name is Jeff Orton, an you've got a little case on your docket agin me." He stood in front of the Judge, and fumbled with the glittering razor." "Well, that is a matter of court business," said the Judfc'e, "and will be disposed of in court at the proper time. " Jesso," asserted Orton, 44 jesso ; but, Jedge, I'm afeared yer don't un derstand the sitooation. Don't be so blasted salty about it. When the Solicitor was willin' ter nol pros the case, what call had you ter in terfere ?" "I can't discuss the case here," re marked the JuMge. " Yer kain't ! Oh, yes, yer kin, Jedge." and the ruffian took his cus tomer's chin in one hand, while he flourished the razor with the other. " Now," he continued, yer see I'm a peaceable, law abidin' man. I make no threats, as some men might do. This case is a regular lite and death business with me. I'd jest as soon cut my throat or cut any other durned man's, as ter be tried in ver court. An' yet yer see, Jedge, I'm a makin' no threats. I'm jest a tellin'yer friendly like, an' open an' above board how I stand. Before I'll be jerked up aa' go tbiough that racket about 'juror look upon the prisoner, an' prisoner look upon the juror,' an' all that devilment, I'm li able to kill myself, or any other hu man in my way." he ioc ked at the Judge with a ti gerish glare in his eyes, and tried the edge of his raz r with his thumb. During this conversation Judge Blank's face had turned all sorts of colors, and finally a dead white. He saw that no one was likely to come into the shop while the storm raged. The idea struck him that Orton was frenzied, and might do something violent. His heart beat tumultous ly, and he felt alarmed in earnest With a feeling cf contempt for him self, he said, pleasantly : " Well, you have a good face, Or ton, and I have about made up my mind to let the solicitor have his way. and drop the case." ' That would be an an act of j-s-tice ter an innercent man," said Orton. u No doubt of it." was the reply. " In fact alter looking at you, and talking with you, I am convinced that you are all right Rest easy. Mr. Orton, the case shall be nol pross'd." "Fust thing after dinner?" said Orton. " The very first thing." Shore an' sartin, Jedge?" " Sure and certain." "Ton yer word of honor as a scholar, an' a gentleman an' a Jedge ?" On my honor. "S'elp ver God?" "Yes."' "An' hopin'yer may die ef yer go back on ver word ?" " Yes." " Bully for you, Jedge. I knew yo'd see that jestice was done. Now let me finish the shave." A Story of Rentacky.
