Mr. Clark and the Caucus. Mr. Clark's latest deliverance shows the very great importance of the coming democratic caucus, or conference. A tentative ways and means committee is to be hosen, a plan agreed upon for revis'ng the Payne law, and a plan devised for taking the power of naming the committees out of the hands of the Speaker and reposing it in tho House. It is a considerable program, and much depends upon 1t. Will less than a week's time be necessary for the work? The men to frame the new tariff measure are to be named now in order that they may get busy at once collecting data. They will thus have nearly a year in which to equip themselves. Does this mean that ihe work of the present tariff board, and that of the enlarged board the President has asked for, are to go for nothing? Is the new ways and means committee to be its own tariff board? Will it act only on statistics gathered by itself, or under its own direction? As between a bill providing for revision all along the line, or a bill or bills protiding lor the schedule-by-schedule revision now so much discussed, llr. Clark expresses a preference for the latter. If the latter is adopted, what schedule or schedules will be selected for the Initial move? The wool schedule is vulnerable l>ecause the President himself has condemned it. Put is it possible for the democrats of the next House to frame a new wool schedule which the democrats and dissatisfied republicans of the Senate will accept? Ami would success on that point alone constitute a suffle'ent basis for a winning appeal to the country on the tariff issue in lt>12? Mr. Clark consents?rather reluctantly, it would seem?to the proposition that the House name the committees through a committee. "The plan meets my approbation. 1 hope it may be worked out so carefully and wisely as not to demoralize the House." Evidently "I hae me doots." But if wisdom fails? If demoralization follows? The presidential campaign will be at hand, and blunders are expensive. January is none too early for consideration of all this business. The democrats face a greater problem than in 181)3. There is the same old tariff question complicated by many irredeemable campaign promises, plus the disastrous failure w hich attended the revision of 18&4. The country will follow with interest and anxiety every step taken, and may be swift in punishing too much or too little undertaken by those to whom it has so recently given Its confidence. "Eli Perkins." . In his uay and way "Eli Perkins" was a merry fellow, and had a prosperous vogue. His gift was slender, but he developed and worked it to wide entertainment. Many men of middle life, and older, will recall his short "pieces for the papers." dealing drolly with small things on the surftfte. and causing a smile. Karely more than a smile. There was neither deep observation nor side-splitting mirth in his upside down appraisements Of men or measures, fads or philosophies. Occasionally a statesman becomes so sensitive on the subject of economy that lie sees designs on the United States Treasury in every interview that is published It would be something worth seeing if Chicago sentiment were to manifest itself as vigorously against the meat packers as against an unpopular opera performer. Japan is getting a great deal of unsolicited advice concerning strategic possibilities on the California coast. A lot of men who are economizing In other directions will soon be wearing silkembroidered suspenders. Mr. Carnegie and Mr. Rockefeller are at*I contestants for the Santa Clans stakes. President Diaz has a neat and effectual method of handling all resignation rumart. Parsimony. L'ncle tJam usually goes about his business with clear vision and with an excellent ndm of proportion. He is ordinarily .egical and foreltanded in his provisions for the administration of this great business enterprise styled the United States of America. He insists upon getting the best materials for his warships, the best gans for his soldiers, the best steel and stone and brick and wood for his public buildings, the best talent for his military and naval service*, the best men for his courts. Ha spares no expense when it oaea to organising and equipping the various parts of the executive system. As a good business man always does, the gawarament has heretofore regarded wise liberality aa true economy iu al! that pertains to the providing of ways and means of running the affairs of the country. But Just at present a singular perversion of thought seems to possess those responsible for the conduct of governmental affairs. In the face of a virtually declining pay scale for the government workers In ail the grades below department and bureau chiefs. It Is now planned to reduce the fores and to make those remaining 'In service work longer, and at the same time In some of the departments curtailing their privileges, such as the allowance of time for sickness. The inversion is carried out In the terms 01 the time-extension plan now in prospect. Half an hour is to be added to the working period during six months of the year. Ordinarily one would enpect this addition to be made during the season of the longer days, covering th< summer time. But according to the present understanding the extra half houi Is to he exacted during the time when the days are short, from October to April, when artificial light is necessary and when (be working conditions arc I moat difficult, and when, furthermore, ft la the least convenient for everybody to I get to work at an earlier hour, j It la amaalag that this process should be carried so far with the consent of the men of affairs who are at the heads of I the various departments and who have had more or less experience In business. These men presumably know that the government will not receive as much In valu I able work from a force so treated as bom a force which feels contented. They must know, too. that the Imposition of an additional half hour in winter In the morning will occasion a serious upheaval of {domestic arrangements and cause endless Jconfuslon which must react upon the | public service. J Fortunately, there is time for this 1 amazing proposition of longer hours for ' a smaller force to be considered before It i is put into effect. The President and his I tmuuiei umccrs win - nave -a iurmer I chance to reflect upon the wisdom and the Justice of at the same time cutting down the clerical members and calling upon the department workers for more labor. In any business establishment this would be a frank confession of stringency, strongly suggestive of approaching bankruptcy. Surely the United ! States is in no such straits as to warrant the fear on the part of any administrative official that unless the clerical pay rolls are cut down by a few score of thousands of dollars annually, and the remaining clerks . worked harder than ever, with fewer privileges, this great government will go Into the hands of a receiver. m III m II America and Japan. Our war scares are always made to j turn on supposed Intentions of Japan. I Nippon is the enemy. We must keep her I ever in mind and ever under suspicion. 1 Her professions of friendship are false. | Her desire to do us injury is earnest and j deep seated. Iler power to injure us as : matters stand is enormous. Beware. Get J ready. Do not be taken by surprise. Should we lose an important point at the start we might be piaced at a disadvantage lasting fcr years. Particulars in support of this warning? There are none worth the name. Japan is no mystery. A very white light has been beating on her ever since her phenomenal rise in the world's affairs. Her army and navy resources are well known. Her peace plans are widely advertised. Her manufacturers are busy. Her national debt is heavy. Death and taxes are as inevitable and unwelcome in that country as in any other, east or west. Stated n an American phrase, Japan has her hands full. Not too full to fight, of course, if the national Interests demanded it, but what .nterests of hers would be served by a war with America? What have we done A Japan, or where is the probable clash between the two countries, which would make it advisable for her to Pick a quar rel with us and strike us upon the instant? Such a war could not be localised. Other powers would Inevitably be drawn in, and it might easily prove to be iho most protracted and destructive struggle the world had ever known. Even if we were taken a little unawares, Japan could not hope to emerge from such a contest in a plight promising for her future, and she might in the end be annihilated. We need a larger army and a larger navy, and our coast defenses are pathetically inadequate. Let us by all means put ourselves in the proper trim to meet any and every possible enemy. But why pick an enemy? Why give the .mpress!on by anything we do that we have a particular power in view*, and chat our preparations are all directed at her? And why should that power be the one whose relations with us have always oeen friendly, and with whom our present connections are of a most cordial character? v Everything we do?and much should be done?to strengthen ourselves afloat and ashore will answer as against an attack from any quarter, Japan Included; but nothing should be done upon the hypothesis and with a proclamation that war is just ahead and we are hurrying for It. It is but natural for government clerks to think wonderingly and perhaps resentfully of large increases of salary which have been established without any suggestions of longer hours. In these scenes of political anxiety Mr. Loeb continues to devote himself to checking smugglers and Mr. Hitchcock to going after the wicked get-rlch-quick man. The recent appearance of Pennsylvania avenue was enougli to discourage anybody from driving a team of mules to the Capttol. There was some disposition to drag Mr. Champ Clark into' a dispute over the nu?a?lAn

One difficulty that the new national ! party appears to experience Is that of getting anything that is really new. . i ??? Washington and the People. Comparatively few members of Congress realise that all the American people take a direct interest and teel a pride In Washington, the National Capital. They have a way of taking Washington for granted, as something negligible, somei thing annoying when legislation is desired, ! and they are disposed in many instances i to berate the Constitution makers for I imposing upon them the duty of exercising exclusive jurisdiction oveh the ten miles square set apart as a seat of government. They do not take account of the immense number of people who annually visit the District, drawn here by its prestige as the nation's center and by its widely advertised attractions. They do not accurately measure the sentiment felt throughout the United States for Washington as a model municipality. President Ta-ft dwelt at unusual length in his annual message upon certain needs of Washington, and whether his recommendations are honored by Congress at a v. i ? a 11 ii-.

IIQK1 IM IIUl, llir> 1I??C U5XH ? lUClj read and arc now the subject of comment | on the part of millions of people, who otherwise would perhaps not have been ! made acquainted with the necessities of the capital. Couched in terms of a ; presidential message to Congress, these items become of national Importance, in keeping with the thought of thv framers of the Constitution when tney set apart ! a certain district for the government's ! own uses and enjoined Congress to care ! for it. The Toledo Blade has the following to say anent the President's remarks about the alley slum evil in this city: " 'Beautiful as Washington looks, there 1 is not a city In the Union of its slxe that ltas fouler alums, or more of them,' was the recent comment of a visitor at the National Capital. In his message to Congress President Taft advocated the destruction of these eentes of disease and crlms and the substitution for them of public playgrounds for the children. The President has earned the gratitude of the people of the District of Columbia and every patriotic citixen of the United States, for Washington will never be the grand capital' or modsl municipality its friends have long dreamed of until its alley habitations, unlit for human occupancy, have been torn down and the i habitues compelled to move to more sanl, tary and decent quarters." It is in this spirit that the members Of i the House and Senate should refjnd t&Mr % * powers sal duties u iocs! lefliktsn. Not merely in the matter of the alley slums, hut la all other respects, they are expected by the people of the country at ' large to do what is necessary to make the District an Ideal community. The j hBiertaan people will not begrudge the comparatively small sums required to . tneet the District's dollars appropriated ' for such works or the federal dolla. a appropriated without supplements from the local tax revenues for the strictly federal undertakings such as the reclamation of the pestilential Eastern branch and the erection of necessary publlg buildings. ; : stembers of Congress who tnlnk that the j average citizen disapproves of wise liberality In the development and maintenance of the National Capital have mis- [V taken the-spirit of the people. ? | A certain similarity in their positions in- j L i vites no cordial sympathy betweerf Col. | !

Our Useful Army. From tUe New York Mall. That an army is a good thing to have on hand even in time of peace was conclusively shown during the great forest fires that swept over Placer and Nevada counties in California in the late summer of this year. The fires got beyond the control of local agencies, and on request from the residents the War Department detailed two companies of Coast Artillery, the 00th and the 147th. from the Department of California, to fight the flames. Those two companies were on duty in the fire zone from August _ 23 until September 9, and during that period they marched from thirty-five to a forty-six miles a day. climbing one moun- tain 5,000 feet high In twenty-four hours, another of 4.000 feet in eleven hours, successfully fighting blazing forests nearly every step of the way. The efforts of those soldiers saved half a dozen lives and property valued at several millions of dollars. All this as a reminder that the army has a little conservation policy of its own which, when occasion requires, becomes effective. . I l Ideal Winter Weather. From tbe Baltimore Erenlng 8uo. Boasting is always dangerous bust ness, yet the temptation to say something about the weather we are having today is too enticing to resist, ii A cloudless sky, an ail- that lnvlgorates but does not bite, a quickstep march In the pulses of every man that paces tho streets?this is ideal '>SJ winter weather. It has suggestions of Christmas and the Christmas spirit in it. Last night the full moon, from a sky flecked with light clouds, looked down on jolly coasting parties; on lakes tilled with joyous skaters; on white-coated. blue-shadowed lawns and fields of tho suburbs and parks. It tilled the air with a mystical radiance and made tremulous the hearts of the more sensitive onlookers. After all. beauty is the one great fact of life, and thoee who miss it find nothing to compensate for it. The wise man will make much of this incomparable season. Democracy's First Test. From the Now York World. The people of New York do not want a' corporation mach.ne senator in place of j Chauncey M. Depew. The people of New t Jersey do not want a corporation ma-: chine senator in place of John Kean. The people of Ohio do not want a corporation machine senator* in place of Charles Dick- The democratic party as ? a whole wants no such senators. The country wants no such senators. It al- "~ ready has too many of them. It Is folly for democratic leaders to talk about redeeming the campaign pledges if they do not put men In office who can be trusted to redeem thoee pledges. The first na- ' ttonal -test of a rehabilitated democratic 5! party will come in the election of United E States senators in these three states. If 5! senators are not elected who can com- a mend public confidence the damage will be almost irreparable, I'!New Year I-,-, -j j: ii Sailing J8wlo,& j j! Largest German Steamer afloat,
