' Scoville endeavored to introduce as evi dence what he (Scoville) had said in rela tion to Shaw, witness for the prosecution, by asking the witness to state to the jury what he (Scoville) had told him, what he had learned in relation to Shaw. Objection was made and sustained when Guiteau shouted out "We have found put that Shaw was guilty of perjury in New Jersey and was told by a Judge f rom, the bench that he ought to be convicted and sent to prison. We also know that En glish was convicted of a low crime in Ire land," The jury ought to know what kind of witnesses you are bringing here to ruin my reputation. - - D. Fordyaebacker of N.

"That's just my case, sir." (With an air of perfect satisfaction). (To Scoville) "Come, that is the whole case. Let's have recess. I'm getting hungry. Mrs. Scoville asked. "Can a man be born insane?" Guiteau. "Oh you keep "still. It's all they can do to put up with me." The"answer was, "No Madam, he could not." WASHTJfGTejr. , , FINANCIAL. - Washington, Dec. 13.

TKUU YESTERDAY. " Washington, Dec . 12,- As soon as the court was called to " order, Guiteau, with flashing eyes and nervous utterance shout ed, "There are a good many poodle dogs ia the Press and I want to express my con tempt for them. ,The high toned Press of tne country are beginning to express their opinion It would be a crime to hang a man who was in my -condition on the 2d of July, when I was impelled upon the President."'-' yrt r r Some one in the room cried "Shoot him now.!" Cries of "order" from ' the baliffs quieted the disturbance, and Dr. Spitzka again took the stand. Witness con cluded from the shape of the face and head ' and ; the defective innovation of the facial muscles and from the pro nounccd deviation f the tongne to the left that the prisoner was born with an un equal development of brains; that his in sanity was congenital.- Witness described with great particularity the peculiarities of the head formation which he had detected in the prisoner's case; thought there was inequality in two sides of the head. This case was three times greater lhan in a nor mal head. The inequality could be taken as an indication of moral imbecility, only i proportion to its degree. Witness con tinued: "If I had only that man's (point ing to Guiteau) mean face to judge by, I would call hjm a depraved man-or an in sane man, but introducing other factors the unequal formation of the head, the ine quality of the facial expression, and the devi ation of the tongue, I am of the opinion that the trouble is of congenial origin. The closest attention was paid by Guiteau to the evidence of this witness, and his coun tenance plainly indicated his satisfaction. Witness, becoming weary, was allowed to sit down, but Corkhill insisted upon his standing, as he could not see or hear him. Witness stood up, saying it was a trivial matter whether Corkhill could see " him. Guiteau was immediately aroused by this retort, and with a chuckle said, "He's a bad man for you, Corkhill, We've got some more of them." - Witness, upon talking about the pris oner, found that he had based his conclu sions upon insane and improbable assump tions, but granting his assumptions to be true his conclusions were logical. The cross examination - was conducted with the evident purpose of discrediting the direct testimony, but Spitzga was more than a match for the questioners. Corkhill sharply questioned -witness re garding the article he contributed to the Medical Journal. A spicy colloquy fol lowed, -which Guiteau interrupted by shouting, "It seems to cause you consider able trouble. You had better cool off Corkhill. I haven't seen you heated so before. It is 3 o'clock. You had better go home." Witness was asked if he had not ap peared as an expert in a certain case, and after taking a fee on one side returned it and taken a larger one from the other side. Witness warmly replied; '"You have no basis for such a question, and no man dares make the assertion upon which he could found it." Guiteau, again interrupting yelled 'That's a very dirty question for you to: ask, CorWull- It just suits your brain, I'm'foing to ask Arthur to kick you out of this case. - -This man is one of the first scientists of the country. : Why, he would not condescend to spit on you CorkhilL You are in bad re.'Uite with every member of this bar, You ar,? an unmitigated nui sance in this case." ' ' Witness, finally making " himself heard, answered: 'Most decidedly, no." Adjourned without concluding the ex amination. . FORTY-SEVEXTH COXUEESS. " i Washington, Dec. 12.
