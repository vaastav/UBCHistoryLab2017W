The 6ilver convention at St. Louis un fjuestionably exprebsed the preponder ating sentiment of the West in its demand for free coinage. There is no reason to suppose, however, that this demand will be complied with by the fifty-first congress. It is not probable, either, that Secy. Wixdom will accede to the request of the convention to coin the maximum of four millions of silver dollars monthly per mitted by the existing law. But he will, doubtless, define his policy as to silver, in his annual report, which will, we pre sume, be submitted Monday. This silver question is an exceedingly embarrassing one for the administration. In all the trans-Mississippi states the silver sentiment, is overwhelming and is loudly demanding recognition. In the East, on the other hand, the opposition to silver is pronounced, and the administration will defy it at its peril. We are curious to 6ee how the president will meet this emergency. Of course he ha no convictions on the silver question which would prevent him, on the one hand, from recommending free coin age, or, on the other, from advising the total demonetization of silver. The only question with the president is as to the relative vote getting advantages of a sil ver or anti-silver policy. It looks now as if there were more votes in advocating sil ver than in opposing it, and, besides, Prine Roslll dwells in Montana, where silver is the great staple, and is supposed to be "running" the republican politics of that infant state. We shali not be at all surprised,' therefore, if the president's message is somewhat silverish in tone. This question of silver coinage is an im portant one, but, as one of the speakers at the convention remarked, there is another question before the country of even greater importance and that is the ques tion of taxation. However desirable free coinage may be, it would be a public calamity if the agitation in its behalf should divert the attention of the people from the great issue of tariff reform, and work a division in the ranks of anti-protectionists. The present law authorizes the coinage of ?l,O0fl of silver per month, and if the treasury will coin this amount, the West can well afford to wait for free coinage until it shall have secured the far greater boon of a radical reform of the tariff. Both free coinage and tariff reform cannot be secured at the same time. One will have to wait. Indiana is for tariff reform first, and then, if it shall ?eem desirable, for free coinage. A Victory For Starvation. Starvation, greed's most powerful ally, hns done its fell work in Clay count-. The miners have turned from the hunger and want of idleness to the slightly modified hunger and want of employment at the operators' terms. It is a victory of rapital over labor, of cupidity over humanity, of the stomach over the head 8nd heart, and Ã¶f wrong over right. And the worst of it all is that the noblest impulses of the heart of one set of men are made to win the victory for the basest im pulses of the heart of another set. The shade of grief crossing the brow of the miner as he thinks on his shivering, hun gry wife and babes, causes a chuckle of exultation in the selfish operator's soul, for in it he sees the omen of another triumph the prediction of greater gains, ;f me re complete subjugation of man to n a?tcr. ' There is little cause for congratulation in the close of the long strike. There are no lessons to le learned from its history. The men have cone back to work. Their families will not starve. But they have p.'ce hack to work much .is the life con vict goes to the galleys. There is no hope f-r the future its only prospect is a life of drudgery and toil, with a dependent family left homeless and friendless at its end. The miners made a noble, dignified fight tor arbitration and livinsr wages. They have nothing but defeat to regret. That justice has not triumphed is not their fault. As they toil beneath the ground, surrounded by darkness and danger, they will have the sympathy and encourage ment of The Sentinel, with the hope that ome time they may have justice done them through the medium they sought the one correct principle on which all dis putes should be settled arbitration. For Free It aw Material. Joeph il. Wade, editor and general manger of Fftre awl Fabric, a publication rlevoted to the interests of the cotton and woolen trades, in a letter just published, ;ays: As a born naturalist and a student of natural law and natural rights, I am satisfied that the duty on raw material should be removed, with ferbaps some rare exceptions. It would then rinsf. not only our carpet manufacturers, but all other textile manufacturers, down to a bard-tan basis with their foreign competitors, nd if we still retained a sufficient protection en manufactured goods, we should be able to compete favorably in thi markets of the world, while keeping our own. This conclusion is a natural one, and not dravn from statistics or commercial reports. I am satisfied that the life of the republican party depends on their aetion.in this matter of raw material. It is no longer a question of political deals, but baa become one of the wrongs which a great people must throw 08; and we have advanced o far io education that even oar laborers tee conclusively that we are saddled with this un natural and unrighteous tax on raw materials, which only prohibits us from buying where we ran boy cheapest. I am not prepared to apply thia principle to manufactured goods, bat the day baa come when it should be applied to raw material, and the day will come when we can apply it to manufactured goods as well. I et tis guard well our industries and snake no mis takes. Mr. Wade is, and always has been, a republican, but he is not a politician. The views he expresses ho ably and clearly are shared by thousands and ten thousands of intelligent republicans, who will not con tinue mach longer to vote with that party if it persists in its present war upon Amer ican industries. Oliver P. Morton was a giant, and the republican party of Indiana Btill lives chiefly on the impetus his genius gave it. Yet the republicans of the capital city, where his great career was for' the mot t part- run, do his memory scant honor. The club which has heretofore styled it self the "Indianapolis Republican - Club," met Wednesday evening to select a new name. It was proposed to call it the "Oliver P. Morton Club," but the proposi tion was voted down. The great Indian an8 name was not rejected ior that of Lincoln, or Grant, or Garfield, or Blaine, or any of the other eminent leaders of the g. o. p., but for the name of Chari.ks B. Fabwell. And Mho is Charles B. Farwell? Well, he is a famous poker player of Chicago, who made a fortune during the war out of contracts for sold iers' overcoats, and by virtue of this same fortune holds a seat in the U. S. senate. Farwell has announced that he will in troduce a bill for the repeal of the civil service law when congress assembles, and it is for this that he finds himself honored above any other republican, dead or alive, by the Indianapolis republicans. It's a grand old party, isn't it? The Philadelphia Pret$, the leading re publican paper of Pennsylvania, goes to some pains to show that it was not "Col." Swokds, Hmt Matthew Stanley Quay, who conceived the idea of sending 10,000 to the Hoffman houe in New York, a democratic rendezvous, to be bet on Har rison a few days before the last presiden tial election. The Press prints the state ment of Maj. John C. Delaney, the senate librarian, "who was close to Col. Quay all through the campaign." This illustrious man of war and letters says: Senator QrAY was very anxious to fight the battle of lgs-S on the Mills bill, and was very much put out by the introduction in the senate of the anti-Mills bill against his earnest plead in CS. The night before the senate bill was in troduced he paced the floor at headquarters until midnight, and then, turning to senator Delamatkr, bis son Dick and myself, he an nounced his determination to send some one the next evening with $10,000 to the Hofiman house to bet on IIakrison. We declared it a good scheme that would overshadow any other event of national importance. The next morn ing the newspaper men were forewarned, and during the day a ten-thousand-do!!ar gold cer tificate was secured. Senator tjl'AY with his own hand wrote the conditions of the wager, and Col. Swokds was selected to place the money. Swokds himself came to me and asked me to help decipher Senator QrAY's manuscript for the convenience of the type writer, and during its deciphering Swords commented on the . brilliancy of the scheme, and praised QcaY in the warmest manner, saying it was no wonder we won in Pennsyl vania with such a crenius as Qt'AY to lead us. The bet was placed, as you all know. These are the true facts, and do one dare dispute them. Th is ten-t housand-dollar bet this "even t of national importance," as Maj. Pelaney calls it this"masterhT Etroke of genius" is claimed to have been what "saved Harrison-." But, according to the man of many prayers, in whese behalf this ten-thousand-dollar bet was made, it was not the bet that elected him. It was the Loud. Di king the past week two of the most destructive fires in our history have taken place in New England. It was a striking coincidence that two fires of such magni tude should have occurred so near to each other, both in time and distance, and that the snme business interest should have been the chief sufferer by 1 ah. The fact that such an enormous destruction of property through this ag n y should be possible in such cities as Boston and Lynn, under the conditions which attended these calami ties, is one of most ungrateful significance. The irn at Boston fire appears to have originated in the deadly electric wires, the dangerous possibilities of w hich are thus revealed in a new and startling light. Every considerable town in the country is literally enveloped in these wires, and it is appalling to think of the death and destruction they are liable to deal out upon some mad freak of the mysterious power, whose subtle affinity for them makes them at once so useful and so terri ble to mankind. The inventive genius which has utilized electricity to such won derful ends, ought to be equal to the task of making it docile and tractable. It is a good servant, but a cruel master. The republicans of the national house of representatives have chosen Peed of Maine for speaker. This choice is but a confirmation of The Sentinel's assertions that the republican party is the party of capital as opposed to labor. Peed repre sents the East the lmnd-hoMing, money lending, railroad-owning section of the country. He is, and his record in con gress has proven him such, the friend of the interest-collecting East as against the producing, interest-paying West. In his capacity as legislator, he has been the con sistent and never-failing champion of the railroads against the people. The speaker exercises a great power in shaping legisla tion, and Reed's selection is full of evil omen for the West. Though imbued with the doctrine of protection fatal to the W-st's prosperity Reed's opponent, Mc- Kinley of Ohio, has u reputation for honesty and intelligence which would have made him more acceptable to the people this side of the Alleghenies. Be- j sides, his attitude on the money question is far more in harmony with that of the vast majority ot the people of the United States than that of his successful com petitor. The Journal, which supposes that it is for protection, but, for the life of it, can't tell why, parades thia statement, by a miner who recently visited England, under the apparent impression that it is good high tariff ammunition: The miners' wanes ranee from an average of 50 cents (in some localities) a day to J f .12 aday in Durham and Northumberland, where thy are said to receive the highest wages. Accord ins to the best information at hand, both from mine inspectors and officers of the miners' union, the average wages a day will not reach 4 shillings (fl) for each day worked. A year it will average about $200 to Z-2.x There are a good many thousand pro tected miners in this country who would be happy if they were guaranteed earn ings of S-00 to ?'2"J5 a year. A dollar a day, aecordiug to an eminent authority, U enough for a w orkingman; and we have the assurance of the Journal itself, made only a few months ngo, when discussing this very question of miners' pay, that $.) a week is not piauper wages. If that paper were edited, which it in't, it would not take so much painsfo show, on its own evidence, that miners in free-trade England do not receive paujKT wages. The Lafayette Courier expresses the hope that, Judge Woornwill be appointed. to the supreme bench to succeed Stanley Mat thews, and says "it would hardly be pos sible for an appointment to be made that would give more general satisfaction to the republicans of Indiana." We presume this is true. And a more irtrikincr com mentary upon the moral status of th? g. o. p. in Indiana could not be found. But what an impressive spectacle Dudley's ;udge on the supreme bench of the United states would present! TnE New York presbyter) has resolved 67 to 15 that the Westminster catechism ought to be revised. A report of the pro ceedings in one of the New York papers says : The sentiment of the presbytery was not only overwhelmingly in favor of revision, but sev eral of the members spoke so fervently io de nunciation of the old confession of faith as to shock the strictly orthodox minority. An ex pression used by many of the speakers was that "the presbyterian church was in need of a doctrinal statement which can be used and which can be understood." The doctrines of irrevocable predestination and infant damna tion were repudiated. One speaker compared the Westminster confession to an anaconda, which holds the church in its folds and fright ens away the members of other denominations. Dr. Paxton said: A man who could preach some of the articles of our faith would not be a contemporary of the nine toenth century. Ho must haT walked out of the seventeenth century. He would l a survival and not of the rilte U We cannot bratb with A i n iia.m's luugs. We cannot look at God through Cal vin's yex. Calvin l.kd at Uod an d saw notlnug lit His terrible sovereignty. We see that His narao is Love. Many of the speakers declared that the church needs a new creed, a brief," compre hensive statement, containing only what Pres byterians hold it necessary to believe. The Rev. Drs. Henry M. Field, Philip Schaff, JlowAKP Crosby, John Ii. Paxtox. IL J. Van Dyk k, Kichakd Harlan and Samt el l. BrncHAED were among those who voted in favor of vevision. "Wonder if Johx Calvin has not turned over in his grave since this revision cam paign began! The Journal tells its readers that the In diana geography is now used "in tome oi the schools of Minnesota." The fact is that these geographies are used in practically all the schools of Minnesota. On the 27th of July last wo published an interview with Prof. Kiehlf., state superintendent of public instruction in Minnesota, touching this geography. We make the following extract: . Cor. "Is it true that Minnesota is trying to get rid of these books?" Supt. Kiehle "Nothing could be further from the truth and the facts. The books are held in universal esteem and are certainly growing in favor. Tiiey are used in nearly ail the schools of the state to the entire satisfac tion of teachers and pupils." IJut the facts make no difference to the school-book trust and its corps of paid liars, chief of which is the Indianapolis Journal. Facts are a commodity in which they do not deal. What this country really needs is fire proof buildings which are proof against fire. 

GOODLOE VS. DE LA HUNT. Patriotism at a Discount and Bourbonism at a I re ruhi m With Harrison. To the Editor .Sir: Maj. Thomas .1. De La Hunt was a Union 6oldier and lost his life in defense of his country, leaving his family in comparative destitution. His widow held the postofiice at Cannel- ! ton, Ind., for a few months under the Ar thur administration, but was removed by the Cleveland administration, an act which subjected Mr. Cleveland to much censure, especially from Senator Harrison. Our readers are well aware of all the facts in this somewhat "celebrated case" and we med not repeat them. Vhen Senator Harrison became president, Mrs. Pe La Hunt and her friends appealed to him for her restoration. Additional misfortunes in her family, by death and fire, made her claims on the president's generosity still greater than when they attracted his at tention in the U. S. senate, yet her peti tion was rejected and her appointment refused. Col. Goodloe, an affluent citizen of Ken tucky, a few days for weeks) ago lost his life in an unnecessary personal altercation with Col. Swope, leaving a family and an estate, the latter reported to amount to not less than 100.000. His widow has inst been appointed by the president to one of ! me mosi lucrative omces in j.eniucKy, that of collector of internal revenue. So the destitute widow of the soldier who died for his country is left in neglect, while the rich widow of the man who died in a disgraceful affray has become the recipient of a lucrative position and the tender sympathies of the president of the United States. The Kentucky mode of sacrificing human life seems to be rated much higher by the president than that which inures to the salvation of the coun try. Bv his conduct he exalts the brutali ties of barbarism and debases the higher duties of patriotism. In all the history of our country, we know of no more strik ing, cold-blooded and unjust discrimina tion against deserving merit in humble life than this last act of President Harri son, and we take the liberty to state here that the soldiers of Indiana will not for get or forgive Harrison for his treatment of Mrs. De I.a Hunt, as a soldier's widow.

Twrre Haute Express. The Exprcts would say one word as a re publican newspaper as to the party issue in this school look controversy. Next September, when the schools open for the winter term, the parents will first appre ciate the great benefit of cheaper books. In November we will have an election. It should not be, and in fact is not, necessary for the members of the state board of education to clear their skirts in the matter of the enforcement of the school book law. So far as President Parsons and Supt. "Wiley are concerned, we know that every person in Terre Haute will re sent the insidious effort to make it appear that they have done, or will attempt to do, anything not strictly within the province of their duties. Their integrity is beyond question and their ability is recognized everywhere. It is a pity that they have been forced to say one word in defense of any action they have taken, and it ia all the more a pity because of the dastardly phase of the attack. EvausviMo Journal. 1 It now seems that in spite of politics next year, the issue before the people is going to be cheap school-books, and that there will have tobe a legislature elected on this issue. The thieving octopus has its agents at work throughout the state, buving up newspapers and even courts, in order to render the new school-book law nugatory. It has" heretofore purchased even state officers, but the public vigilance is so focused on them that they are placed on their good behavior. The time has passed for the octopus to dictate the nom ination and election of superintendents of public instruction. To their shame be it said, the democratic and republican partu s have both been dominated in this office by the octopus. Hereafter every man with the smell of fire on his garments must be spotted and ostracised. If either party nominate an octopus man, let him be de feated at all hazards. The unprincipled old school-book octo pus has at last found a Jeffrey in the northern part of the state corrupt and ignorant enough to pronounce the new school-book law unconstitutional. Amongst all the circuit judges of Indiana one has at last been found who could be bam boozled if not bought. Thank the Lord, the interests of the poor children of the state do not depend on" the decisions of purchasable judges. The prices of books are going to be lower, or the people will know the reason why. A legislature will be elected next time that will lind a way to pass h law that will be constitution proof. The newspapers of this state that are doing everything in their power to keep up the prices of school books and to fortify the power of the octopus one of the most unprincipled and corrupt monopolies that ever existed are subjecting themselves to serious suspicions of mercenary motives. It will not do for the republican pa.-ty Or anv other partv to identify itself with the old school book fraud. The people are "onto" it. fLafayette Courier. There was a great deal of well-grounded complaint concerning the exactions of the old school-hook ring, and in some quarters the opposition of the new company is quite as pronounced. On general princi ples, the Courier regards the new arrange ment superior to the old. A 

DISGRACEFUL RECORD. Mr. Hnrrison's Scandalous Appointments in Ilia Oun Stntf. fSt. Liil Republic. 1 In the "Washington correspondence yes terday the Reiiuh'ir summed up the record of Harrison administration appointments in Mr. Harrison's own state. We venture to say that a more ' scandalous record was never made in the history of any country. The appointments embrace criminals and outcasts of every class. Neither proven theft; nor the suspicion of murder for pur poses of robbery; nor notoriety as a male inmate of a bagnio; nor any other crime of all the infamous crimes which fill the penitentiaries, has been held to disqualify these repulican "workers" from receiving the rewards of their sacrifices under the "essential and discriminating test" of fit ness applied under Mr. Harrison's system of spoils' bossism. In Missouri this system has resulted in the frequent sale of the olfices for money, as the PepntÃ-'ic, has proven from time to time by sworn statements of reliable wit nesses, as well as bv the forced confession of one of the principal criminals, but vil lainous as is such an abuse of constitutional authority, it cannot compare with the foul and shameless indecency of the distribu tion of the spoils in the president's own 6tate. This infamous work has been done in the grades of the federal service to which appointments are made without consent of the senate and without the regulation of the Pendleton civil service law. The men thus rewarded have received oflice. be cause they were a part of the blocks of five conspiracy by which Indiana was carried. Gross as is the partisanship and arrogant as is the bossism of the republican majority in the senate, such appointments would not have been made possible had they been subject to review by the senate, lint beinjr held to no direct responsibility to anyone, the administra tion went to an extreme of vicious respon sibility which if allowed to laconic a pre cedent will eurely destroy the govern ment. It is not Mr. Harrison's individual action ; it is worse it is hin system. The results are achieved by a machine con structed for him by the distribution of the spoils; set in motion by him and operated under his sanction. He would have lacked common sense not to anticipate auch results. He certainly knows what they are, and giving them his counte nance, sustaining them with the authority he holds in trust, he accepts full responsi bility for them.

Tugar was not danger ously hurt by the shot, and said he had sent his boy Ut to get aotnething to eat, but he was not successful.

Senator Vooihees Speaks of the Prospects Republican Leaders Will It r sort to Des perat )laarri as the Confidence of the Conntry Is Lott. Senator Voorhecs arrived in the city Friday afternoon. For some time past be has been in the state, but returned Saturday to Washington to prepare to as sist in contending every step of the repub lican congress in its proposed nefarious legislation. Senator Voorhecs is not in exceptional good health at present, but pays he will be in condition, when the time comes, to lend all the energy he possesses to prevent legislation against the people and right, and for. monopoly and section alism. He strongly denounces the policy of the present administration and savs that legislation in line with it would be ruinous. At the hotel he faid: "It seems tomethattheapproachingses sion of congress will be neither a pleasant nor a profitable one. The republican party has a majority in both branches, and also the president, but I predict no useful legislation to the country. The recent elections, and the manifest failure of the administration to retain the confidence of the country, have startled the leaders of the republican party, and they will resort to desperate measures. The great ques tion oi this day and generation, paramount to all other questions of public concern, is the reform of the present abominable tariff, but when the Fifty-first congress ad journs no reform will be found to have been made. The same hideous inequality and robbery will preval in taritF taxation then as now, and the labor of the country will groan under the curse of slavery as it does to-day. The continuance of the re publican party in jower means the con tinued bondage of the laborer to his task master, and the continued pinching poverty of his wife and children. Instead of grap pling with this great iniquity for its over throw, and for the relief of the toiling masses, the leaders of the party now in power will aiain crouch down over the dead ashes of sectional hate, and try to re kindle fires long since extinguished bv the common judgment of the country and the Christian sentiments of mankind. '.'An aitemut will be made to enact laws for the control of all elections in the southern 6tates by federal power and by federal bayonets, if necessary, to carry them for the republican party. I do not expect this attempt to succeed because the minority in the house, and indeed in both branches, is too strong to permit such a total overthrow of our system of govern ment. Minorities have their rights and their powers, and their greatest fuuetion is to guard the liberties of the people and the existence of the states from wrong and subversion at the hands of a reckless, par tisan, and lawless majority." "What do you think of the prospects of the democratic party from the present outlook ?'' "As to the general outlook for the fu ture I never felt so confident of success for the democratic party as I do now. I have a reason for the faith that is in me, and it consists in the fact that on the mighty issue of equal rights and equal burdens of taxation the democratic party has the eternal right for its platform. On this issue it will grind its opponents to dust. It is only a question of time, and of Ãhort time at that. The light is travel ing fat on this subject. To the full ex tent of my humble abilities and to the end of mv life I expect to aid in its dissemina tion." 

MICHENER NOT IDLE. Iiis Agents Already at Work Thronguout t'ie S ate. Sryuiour Democrat. Chairman Michener of the republican state central committee, admit3 with re freshing candor that the assignment of postmasters to the fourth-class olfices in the democratic congressional districts of this state has been placed in his hands. He admits, further, that the business of patronage distribution is congenial, that he likes it in fact, and that he proposes to dispose of his favors by placing them where they will do the most good. But Chairman Michener has other business in hand, which he is pushing for all that it is worth. He is conducting a general atrency, his "trusted men" are at work in all parts of the state, and For ways that are dark, And trick that are vain. Chairman Michener's agents are peculiar. And thereby, and thereon, hangs a tale. A few days since, a dapper, mysterious fellow, who told those to whom he talked that he was from Shelbyville and" that he was "Mr. Michener's agent," visited Brownstown, and called upon euch repub lican workers, and such only, as were earn est and unswerving in their support of Harrison before his nomination and dur ing the last canvass. To these he said that he had a mission, and that his mis sion was to get the republicans together and in line for the next state canvass. His instructions were not to call upon or to have anything to say to such republicans as were inclined to independence in political action. They were to be ignored by him ; but he was to instruct the "trusted men" to call upon these disaffected or disap pointed ones, and to say to them that, "of course, Harrison wasn't their first choice, but now he was elected, and everything was republican, and that, by all getting to gether and Working in harmony the re publicans would Ik? able to maintain their control of the state and general govern ments, indefinitely." In the course of his remarks, he oilVred many suggestions and made a number of revelations. He even went so far, in his description of the re publican ways and means of the last can vass, as to prate about the distribution of boodle, and to boast of the extent to which he had used the corruption fund in the purchase of Shelbyville and Shelby county voters. The work had been well done, and it could be easily accomplished again in the same way. As an induce ment to those partly out of the traces to come again into line and pull with the machine team, he said that of course all could not be rewarded by one adminstra tion, but that such as had been neglected this time would be fully recognized the next. The Democrat, in this narration, is reciting no id'e tale. The Democrat is nar rating facts of which it has full, accurate, reliable and indisputable evidence. How this information came to the Democrat is not the concern of any one. We have told the plain truth in plain terms.

Jupiter now transits the place of the total eclipse of the sun of the 1st of Jan uary last, observes Zadkiel, developing the trade and commerce of San Francisco ; and J probably causing renewed shocks of earth- j quake in the ninety-ninth degree of west longitude. The stationary position of j Saturn in Virgo U ".V atilicts a certain I royal horoscope. The king of the Itelgi aus and M. ltfchefort will be companions in misfortune now, for Saturn alllicts the moon's place in their horoscopes. The conjunction of Mars und Uranus in Libra, '2'.i ' brings a srry Christmas to persons born on or about the l'.'th of October, particularly to those born in or lNiÃ¶. The conjunction of Mercury and Jupiter in Caprieornus 1 4' benefits all who were born on or near the Tth of Janu ary, especially those born in 18't, or 1S"4 or 1S1. The 4th, Mil, 18th, ilst, 11, 25th and 27th of this month are frttf nate birthday anniversaries, (excepting for those who were born when the moon held either the fourth degree of Vigo, or the twenty-seventh degree of Libra). The 22d inet. was an evil birthday anniversary for those who were born in either 170, 18f,7, lSÃ¶Ã¶, 1S40, IS i-, 1S:, lSIL, or S-'f,; on the other hand, it is fortunate fr those born in either ls")7, lsÃ¶l, lsrÃ¶, 1S4C, l:i, 18:i4, lSO or 1S29. The king of Creece finds fate pressing him hard. Toward the close of this year we shall hear of a de structive earthquake in South America. Jlnohaefs I'roufoUc M, ; nt'i, r says: The new moon occurs early in the morning of I the -od u!to., at which time the end of Virgo will be rising and Mars will be lo cated in the first house; HÃ¶rschel will be on the cusp of the second; Mercury on the cusp of the third, with the lights therein, and Saturn will have just passed the cusp of the twelfth house. The oriental posi tion of Mars, he being in quart ile aspect to Jupiter, is very unfavorable for this country, and will produce serious dimen sions in the laud, distress, panics and fail ures in the money m::rket; also many fires and accidents, more esjecially in the eastern, southern and midland countries. The Luminaries in square aspect to Saturn will cause the death of great and noble persons, and probably some sickness in the royal family. Uranus on the cusp of the second is unfavorable for monev, trade and commerce, and a marked falling off in the customs receipts may be expected. Mercury on the cusp of the thirl in semi-square to Jupiter wid damage the railway interest and depress the market value of their shares. Saturn near the twelfth, and heavily atllictel, points to much crime, robbery and theft, and that pauperism will increase greatly. Jupiter in the fourth in square to Mars denotes a windy month, with a higher temperature th;in usual, many squall, and probably thunder. Earthquakes will occur in the southern countries of Furope. Following are the admonitions for each day in the month: 1. Sunday Travel and visit friends. 2. A doubtful day; be very careful. 3. Still very doubtful. 4.

ELI HORNADAY'S FLIGHT. Details of the Last K.icap.ide of One of It ud ley's Trusted JUn. The Sentinel some days ago printed an account of the flight of "Trusted Man" Eli Hornada', from Arizona, with another man's wife. Ilornaday, it will be remem bered, was appointed by Fresident Harri son a special timber agent, and sent to Arizona. A AVashington correspondent gives the details of his recent escapade, with a running review of his career: Mr. Eli C. Ilornaday of Indiana has retired from public service. A few days ago, in these dispatches, Eli's record was ventilated to a cer tain extent. It will be remembered that he started out as a farmer; took up with 9 lewd woman and was egged out of town where he rebided. He went to Terre Haute, and from Terre IJaute to Indianapolis, where he pur chased the "Long Branch," one ot the most notorious houses of ill-fame in the West. He confidenced a nmoesake of his, by claiming re lationship with him, out of t5,000, and was indicted by the grand jury of Ham ilton county for the offense. He was a very bandy man around the republican headquarters at Indianapolis during the last canvass and did a good deal of hard work in rounding up the touelis of the city in blooks of five on election day. Harrison knew him well and was entirely familiar with his record, lie had to be rewarded for the work performed by him during the canvass and was made a tim ber inspector and assigned to duty in Arizona. His natural tendency to crookedness asserted itself in the discharge of his oflicial duties in the far off territory and complaints began to pour in to the commissioner of land office. These complaiuts were so well sustained and Hornadoy's general character being so bad that the commissioner of land ottice insisted 011 Secy. Noble's dismissing Ilornaday from the public tervice. This was easier said than done, however, as Ilornaday was a personal appointment of the president, and Secy. No ble had to get consent from the white house before Hornadny could be fired. Harrison insisted that Ilornaday should be let down easy, and the commissioner of the land otSce wrote him a letter ordering him to Indianapolis and then to forward his resigna tion to the department. 1.1 i knew that an in dictment awaited him in Indiana and he did not care to face it, eo when he received Com missioner GrofTs letter ordering him to resign when he reached Indianapolis he came to the conclusion that he would turn his face south ward instead of eastward. He Bold a lot of government timber, fctole two horses and a man' wife and lit out for Mexico. Eli is en joying lite, no doubt, in the land of God and liberty, and his bond.nen in Indiana will no doubt have to whistle wheu his case is called in court. Bad as Hornady is, he is considerably better than several others who were appointed to federal of Hees from Indiana. None of the others, however, have as yet been invited to re sign, and, 110 doubt, if Eli could have refrained from thieving when 'ie was sent to Arizona he could still be enjoyi..g his salary and his honors as an oflicer of the government. Several trades men and at least two hanks at Prcscott, Ariz., are in mourning for Eli, but the man whose wife he stole is said to be the happiest man in the territory. Catarrh Cored. A clereyman, after years of su tiering from the loathsome disease of catarrh, and vainly trying every known remedy, at last found a prescription which completely cured and saved him from death. Any sutt'eter from this dread ful disease sending a self-addressed stamped envelops to Trof. J. A. Lawrence, 88 Warren st.. New York, will receive a receipt free o charge. A 

REFUHM OF THE TARIFF. THE GREATEST NEED OF THE HOUR, Mr. Cyrus K. Davis Iasups an Address to thi People of the second CnnfMMion'! District Speedy end Thorough Organization Urged. The Hon. Cyrus E. Davis, vice-president of the Indiana tanft reform loagne for the Second district, lias issued the following address: The writer desires to address you on a sub ject in which he believes you take a like inter est with himself, and tiie stute i-rganifations under which he acts. We believe that the most opportune time in which to ng tate the policy ot tariti' reformers is during the unimpassioned months, between political campaigns, when no party coutest clouds the meLtal vision with its dust and smoke, or infames the passions of men with its appeals to hatred, prejudice and party pride. Once concentrate tiie impartial calm thought of our countrymen on the great wrongs of unnecessary taxation and class legis lation and they will vanuh like an April mow. A tystttu that appeal to the prejudices of the uninformed ami unthinking by denying the fundamental and time-tried law of trade that all iudirect taxes are in tiie end paid by the consumer, and claiming instead that our na tional burdcus are borne by foreigners and not by ourselves; a system which causes the cost of living to more then destroy any advantage that natural conditions have given the toiler in the price of his toil; a system which ii verts much of the cost of production which should go to increase the wages of labor to the payment in tead of an enormous tax on raw material, op erating in this way at the same time to so in crease the price of labor's products as to ex clude them from the markets of tLe world; a system which seeks the support of the consumer by claiming to reduc tiie prices of commodi ties, while asking the support of the laboring producer by professing to increase those prices; a system which seeks to restrict by tariff laws our commerce with foreign nations while at the sane time its advocates demand the subsidy of steamships, and concede the advantage of in ternational railways, inter-O'-t-an canals and all American congresses for the purpose of in creasing the very trade which by tariff laws they wish artificially to restrict; a system winch rests on the assume! dependence of, manufacturing industries, on legis.ative help In a lanl blessed by a laboring cla whose supe rior intelligence and productive power more than reimoursc the employer for the higher wages that he pays; in a Luid whose accumu lated capital, natural resources, commercial advantages, restless energy nn t ingenuity ol population fur surpass the like endowments ot a:iy other land; in short, a eystem which at tempts p.n app'-al to human reason through t conglomeration of eeit-betray:ug fallacies, silly inconsistencies, and palpable fal-choods cannot long abide the li-rht of investigation aud the ciiliciitening power of popular agitation. We beiieve the following proposhions are as well established as any rule in physical or social . science (1) the ccn-umer pays all indirect taxes; nianufucturicg and agriculture in America can never mutuaÃ¼y supply each other with a sufiicicnt hcrus market since both tranches now produce a surplus and any in crease in the force engaged in either, without a foreign outlet, would ouly cause an increase in the enormous over-production which already hampers them both; (3) a good foreign mar ket is thus absolutely necessary for the health ful development of both these branches of in dustry; (4) any legislation that tends to check the importntion of foreign goods, tends in the same r.ifio to hinder the exportation cf domestic products, and thereby curtails our foreign market; (0) as a general rule, meas. ured by its superior productive power, Amer ican labor is the least expensive labor in the world, and other things being equal its products can successfully compete with those of the labor of any other land. These great truths once understood the sys tem which oppresses us all wiil have nothing upon which to ret in the popular judgment. The method of agitation which the Indian, tariff reform league has proposed is bv awak ening investigation and diliusing iustruction through local organizations. Thpse organisa tions are desired in evtry precinct in the state. The president of the state league, Mr. Edgar A. Brown of Indianapolis, has recently made, through the columns of Thk Indian A FO Lis Daily Sentinkl, a request that the organiza tion of the stat; be complete by Jan. 1, IN'. It is made my duty as one of the vice-presidents of the league to look after these organizations in tVe Second congressional district. We be lieve central organization has been completed in nearly, if not quite, everv county in the dis trict. The county organization should proceed at once to organize the precincts throughout the county, and let each supporter of the cuuse in every precinct feel ersonal!y solicited to take part in bringing about an organization of his precinct at once. If desired, and two weeks' notice is given me, I will endeavor to procure a speaker to address your first meeting in each precinct and assist in your organization. Let the grand work go forward promptly. Cvrvs E. Davis. Bloomfield, Ind., Nov. 20.
