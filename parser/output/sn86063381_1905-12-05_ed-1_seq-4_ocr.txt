i CORTELYOU MAY BE CALLED. Will Be Asked to Testify Conoeming Campaign Contributions. New York, Dec. 5.Senator Arm strong, chairman of the legislative life Insurance investigating committee, said during the day that there was an erroneous impression that the life of the committee would end at the begin ning oi the next session of the legisla ture on Jan. 3. This, he said, was not true. The committee would continue In existence and could continue to sit and take evidence unless the legisla ture by joint action ordered the in vestigation stopped. "We hope and intend," said Senator Armstrong, "to finish this investiga tion Dec. 31 and to make our re port to the legislature when it opens. We have got at the main things and the moral effect is hall" The senator said it is possible that Postmaster General Cortelyou and Cornelius N. Bliss of the Republican national committee will be called, but he does not see any reason why they should. Asked about the probability of calling other witnesses, among whom H. H. Rogers had been men tioned as a possibility, the senator said the committee was not appointed to investigate the Standard Oil com pany. "There are insurance men," he said, "who would be glad to have us devote the twenty-three days remaining to something else than insurance." DRAIN RED RIVER VALLEY. North Dakota Delegation Will Ask Government Aid. Washington, Dec. 5.The North Da kota delegation will meet this month to consider ways and means for the drainage of the Red River valley in that state. Members ot the delega tion insist that the valley should be reclaimed from an excess of water and that the matter is one that should be dealt with by the reclamation serv ice. Government and county engineers have surveyed the valley ana a plan has been evolved whereby thousands of acies can be reclaimed. Seed Dealers Oppose Free Seeds. Washington, Dee. 5.Thirty ot the leading seed dealers ot the country have sent President Roosevelt a peti tion piotesting against the free dis tribution ot seeds by members ot con gress and urging him to include in his message a paragiaph disapproving the present practice and recommending that only the intent of the original act authorizing seed distribution be the future policy.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Continued from Page One. conuueteu""Tito Tlie~IialiOhal" T5aTBT?g"T the bank examiners. A few first class railroad accountants, if they had prop er direction and proper authority to in epect books and papers, could accom plish much in preventing willful viola tions of the law. Employer*' Liability Larv. In my annual message to the Fifty eighth congress at its second session I recommended the passage ol up em ployers' liability law for the District of Columbia and in our navy yards. I re newed that recommendation in my message to the Fifty-eighth congress at its second session and further suggest ed the appointment of a commission to make a comprehensive study of em ployers' liability with a view to the en actment of a wise nd constitutional law covering the subject, applicable to all industries within the scope of the federal power I hope that such a law will be prepared and enacted as speed ily as possible. There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes. Such special limita tion of the equity powers of our courts would be most unwise. It is true that some judges have misused this power, but this does not justify a denial of the power any more than an improper ex ercise of the power to call a strike by a labor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike. The remedy is to regulate the procedure by requiring the judge to give due notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing to be ex parte if the adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered. What is due notice must depend upon the facts of the case. It should not be used as a pretext to per mit violation of law or the jeopardiz ing of life or property. Of course this would not authorize the issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case in which it is not already author ized by exisfing law. I renew the recommendation I made in my last annual message for an in vestigation by the department of com merce and labor of general labor condi tions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation in the se\ eral states. Such an in\ estigation should take into account the various problems with which the question of child labor is connected. In such a republic as ours the one thing that we cannot afford to neglect is the problem of turning out decent citizens. The future of the na tion depends upon the citizenship of the generations to come. The children of today are those who tomorrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we cannot afford to neglect them. The leg islature of Colorado has recommended that the national government provide some general measure for the protec tion from abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United Ttates. I lay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable consider ation As to Women Who Work. The department of commerce and la bor should also make a thorough inves tigation of the conditions of women in industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo men are now engaged in gainful occu pations, yet there is an almost complete dearth of data upon which to base any trustworthy conclusions as regards a subject as important as it is vast and complicated. The introduction of wo men into industry is working change and disturbance in the domestic and social life of the nation. The decrease in marriage, and especially in the birth rate, has been coincident with i(j. We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustment to factory conditions must be made, but surely it can be made with less friction and less harmful ef fects on family life than is now the case. This whole matter in reality forms one of the greatest sociological phenomena of our time. It is a social question of the first importance, of far greater importance than any merely po litical or economic question can be. In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employee inter ested, but also a third partythe gen eral public Every considerable labor difficulty in which interstate commerce is involved should be investigated by the government and the facts officially reported to the public Insurance. The great insurance companies afford striking examples of corporations whose business has extended so far beyond the jurisdiction of the states which created them as to preclude strict enforcement of supervision and regulation by the parent states. In my last annual message I recommended "that the congress carefully consider whether the power of the bureau of corporations cannot constitutionally be extended to cover interstate transac tions in insurance." Recent events have emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this question, to see whether it is not possible to furnish better safeguards than the several states have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed. It has been only too clearly shown that certain of the men at the head of these large corporations take but small note of the ethical distinction between honesty and dishonesty. They draw the line only this sideSof what may be called law honesty, the kind of honesty necessary in order to avoid falling into the clutches of the law. Of course the only complete remedy for this condi tion must be found in an aroused pub lic conscience, a higher sense of ethical conduct to the community at large and especially among business men and in the great profession of the law, and in the growth of a spirit which condemns all dishonesty, whether in rich man or in poor man, whether it takes the shape of bribery or of blackmail. But much can be done by legislation which is not only drastic, but practical. There Is need of a far stricter and more uni form regulation of the vast insurance interests of this country. The United States should in this respect follow the policy of other nations by providing adequate national supervision of com mercial interests which are clearly na tional in character. I repeat my previous recommenda tion that the congress should consider whether the federal government has any power or owes any duty with re spect to domestic transactions in in surance of an interstate character. That state supervision has proved in adequate is generally conceded. The Revenue*. There is more need of stability ,than of the attempt to attain an ideal per fection in the methods of raising rev enue, and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change in these methods ren der such change inadvisable unless for grave reason. It is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to de termine the moment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a change. No change can be made on lines beneficial to or desired by one section or one state only. There must be something like a general agree ment among the citizens of the several states that the change is needed and desired in the interest of the people as a whole, and there should then be a sin cere, Intelligent and disinterested ef fort to make it in such shape as will combine, so far as possible, the maxi mum of good to the people at large with the minimum of necessary disre gard for the special interests of' locali ties or classes, but in time of peace the revenue must, on the average, takinq a series of years together, equal the expenditures or else the revenues must be increased. Last year there was a deficit. Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenues then our revenue laws must be readjusted. It is impossible to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for it is as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it. It should be considered whether it is not desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying as against or in favor of any other nation maximum and minimum tariff rates established by the congress, so as to secure a certain reciprocity of treatment betwreen 4~ other nations and ourselves. Economy In Expenditures. I earnestly recommend to the con gress the need of economy and, to this end, of a rigid scrutiny of appropria tions. All unnecessary offices should be abolished^ In the public printing also a large saving of money can be made. There is a constantly growing tendency to publish masses of unim portant information at which no human being ever looks. Yet, in speaking of economy, I must in nowise be understood as advocating the false economy which is in the end the worst extravagance. To cut down in the navy would be a crime against the nation. To fail to push forward all worl^ on the Panama canal would be as great a folly. Cnrreney. Every consideration of prudence de mands the addition of the element of elasticity to our currency system. The evil does not consist in an inadequate volume of money, but in the rigidity of this volume, which does not respond as it should to the varying needs of communities and of seasons. Inflation must be avoided, but some provision should be made that will insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than in the less ac tive seasons of the year, so that the currency will contract against specula tion and will expand for the needs of legitimate business. At present the treasury department is at Irregularly recurring intervals obliged in the inter est of the business worldthat is, in the interests of the American public to try to avert financial crises by pro viding a remedy which should be pro vided by congressional action. Business Methods In Departments. At various times I have instituted in vestigations into tile organization and conduct of the business of the execu tive departments. While none of these Inquiries have et progressed far enough to warrant final conclusions, they have already confirmed and em phabized the general impression that the organization of the departments is often faulty in principle and wasteful in results, while many of their business methods are antiquated and inefficient. I recommend that the congress consider this subject. Federal Elections. In my last annual message I said: "The power of the government to protect the integrity of the elections of its own officials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmed by re peated declarations of the supreme court. There is no enemy of free gov ernment more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption of the elect orate. No one defends or excuses cor ruption, and it would seem to follow that none would oppose vigorous meas ures to eradicate it. I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and corruption in federal elec tions. The details of such a law may be safely left to the wise discretion of the congress, but it should go as far as under the constitution it is possible to go and should include severe penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe intended to influence his act or opinion as an elector and provisions for the publication not only of the expend itures for nominations and elections of ill candidates, but also of all contribu tions received and expenditures made by political committees." I desire to repeat this recommenda tion. s*. 

MBHH All contributions- by corporations to any political committee or for any po litical purpose should be forbidden by law, directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes, and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts. The Hague Conference. The first conference of nations held at The Hague in 1899, being unable tc dispose of all the business before it, recommended the consideration and settlement of a number of important questions by another conference to be called subsequently and at an early date. These questions were the follow ing: (1) The rights and duties of neu trals (2) the limitation of the armed forces on land and sea and of military budgets (3) the use of new types and calibers of military and naval guns: (4) the inviolability of private property at sea in times of war $) the bombard ment of ports, cities and villages by na val forces. In October, 1904, at the in stance of the interparliamentary union, I issued invitations to all the powers signatory to The Hague convention tc send delegates to such a conference and suggested that it be again held at The Hague. From all the powers acceptance was received, coupled in some cases with the condition that we should wait until the end of the war then waging be tween Russia and Japan. The emperoi of Russia, immediately after the treaty of peace which so happily terminated this war, in a note presented to the president on Sept. 13 took the initiative in recommending that the conference be now called. The United States gov ernment in response expressed its cor dial acquiescence and stated that it would as a matter of course take part In the new conference and endeavor to further its aims. We assume that all civilized governments will support the movement and that the conference i now an assured fact. This government will do everything in its power to se cure the success of the conference to the end that substantial progress may be made in the cause of international peace, justice and good will. Monroe Doctrine. There are certain essential points which must never be forgotten as re gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first place, we must as a nation make it ev ident that we do not intend to treat it in any shape or way as an excuse fox aggrandizement on our part at the ex pense of the republics to the south. But we must make it evident that we do not intend to permit the Monroe doc trine to be used by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect it from the consequences of its own misdeeds against foreign nations. The Monroe doctrine does not force us to interfere to prevent the punishment of a port save to see that the punishment does not assume the form of territorial occu pation in any shape. The case is more difficult when it refers to a contractual obligation. This country would cer tainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt. On the other hand, it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to take possession, even tempo rarily, of the custom houses of an American republic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations, for such temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only es cape from these alternatives may ai any time be that we must ourselves undertake to bring about some arrange ment by which sa much as possible of a just obligation shall be paid. To do so insures the defaulting re public from having to pay debts of an improper character under duress, while it also insures honest creditors of the republic from being passed by in the interest of dishonest or grasping, cred itors. Moreover, for the United States to take such a position offers the only possible way of insuring us against a clash with some foreign power. The position is therefore in the interest of peace as well as in the interest of jus tice. Santo Domingo. Santo Domingo has now made an ap peal to us, and not only every principle of wisdom, but every generous instinct within us, bids us respond to the ap peal. The conditions in Santo Domingo have for a number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all society Avas on the verge of dissolution. Fortunately just at this time a ruler sprang up in Santo Domingo who, with his colleagues, saw the dangers threat ening their country and appealed to the friendship of the only neighbor who possessed the power and the will to help them. There was imminent dan ger of foreign intervention. The pa tience of foreign creditors had become exhausted, and at least two foreign na tions were on the point of intervention and were only prevented by the unoffi cial assurance of this government that it would itself strive to help Santo Domingo in her hour of need. Accordingly, the executne depart ment of our government negotiated a treaty under which we are trying to help the Dominican people to straight en out their finances. This treaty is pending before the senate. In the meantime a temporary arrangement has been made under which the Domin ican government has appointed Amer icans to all the important positions in the customs service, and they are see ing to the henest collection of the rev enues, turning over 45 per cent to the government for running expenses and putting the other 5o per cent into a safe depositary for equitable division in case the treaty shall be ratified among the various creditors, whether European or American. Under the course taken stability and order and all the benefits of peace are at last coming to Santo Domingo, dan ger of foreign intervention has been suspended, and there is at last a pros pect that all creditors will get justice, no more and no less. If the arrargo- Bient Is terminated by the failure of the treaty chaos will follow, and sooner or later this government may be in volved in serious difficulties with for eign governments over the island or else may be forced Itself to intervene in the island in some unpleasant fash ion. Army and Navy. I do not believe that any army in the world has a better average of enlisted man or a better type of junior officer, but the army should be trained to act effectively in a mass. Provision should be made by sufficient appropriations for maneuvers of a practical kind. Provision should be made for the pro motion of exceptionally meritorious men over the heads of their comrades and for the retirement of all men who have reached a given age without get ting beyond a given rank. There should be an increase in the coast artillery force so that our coast fortifications can in some degree adequately manneu. There is special need for an increase and reorganization of the medical department of the army. In both the army and navy there must be the same thorough training for duty in the staff corps as in the fighting line. The importance of this Was shown con clusively in the Spanish-American and the Russo-Japanese wars. The work of the medical departments in the Jap anese army and navy is especially worthy of study. Our navy must, relatively to the na vies of other nations, always be of greater size than our army. We have most wisely continued for a number of years to build up our navy, and it has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. This standard must not only be maintained, but increased. It does not seem to me necessary, how ever, that the navy should, at least in the immediate future, be increased be yond the present number of units. What is now clearly necessary is to substitute efficient for inefficient units as the latter become worn out or as it becomes apparent that they are use less. Probably the result would be attained by adding a single battleship to our navy each year, the superseded or outworn vessels being laid up or broken up as they are thus replaced. Naturalisation. On this subject I recommend: FirstA federal bureau of naturali zation, to be established in the depart ment of commerce and labor, to su pervise the administration of the natu ralization laws and to receive returns of naturalizations pending and accom plished. Second.Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to be charged, and procedure. Third.More exacting qualifications for citizenship. Fourth.The preliminary declaration of intention to be abolished and no alien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing of his peti tion. Fifth. Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to be confined to United States district courts and to such state courts as have jurisdiction in civil actions in which the amount in controversy is un limited in cities of over 100.000 inhab itants the United States district courts to have exclusive jurisdiction in the naturalization of the alien residents of such cities. Criminal Laws. In my last message I asked the at tention of the congress to the urgent need of action to make our criminal law more effective, and I most ear nestly request that you pay heed to the report of the attorney general on this subject. There seems to be no statute of the United States which provides for the punishment of a United States attor ney or other officer of the government who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain from doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement is other than one possessing money value. This ought to be remedied by appropriate legislation. Legislation should also be enacted to cover explicitly, unequivocally and be yond question breach of trust in the shape of prematurely divulging official secrets by an officer or employee of the United States and to provide a suitable penalty therefor. Merchant Marine. To the spread of our trade in peace and the defense of our flag in war a great and prosperous merchant marine is indispensable. We should have ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets and in case of need to re-enforce our battle line. It cannot but be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that the lines of communication with our sister republics of South America should be chiefly under foreign control. It is not a good thing that American merchants and manufacturers should have to send their goods and letters to South Amer ica via Europe if they wish security and dispatch. Even on the Pacific, where our ships have held their own better than on the Atlantic, our mer chant flag is now threatened through the liberal aid bestowed by other gov ernments on their own steam lines. I ask your earnest consideration of the report with which the merchant ma rine commission has followed its long and careful inquiry. It is a matter of unmixed satisfac tion once more to call attention to the excellent work of the pension bureau, for the veterans of the civil war have a greater claim upon us than any other class of our citizens. To them first of all among our people honor is due. Immigration. As I said in my last message to the congress, we caunot have too much Immigration of the right sort, and we should have none whatever of the wrong sort. The questions arising in connection with Chinese immigration stand by themselves. The conditions in China |re such that the entire Chinese cooly classthat Is, the class of Chinese la borers, skilled and unskilled legiti mately come under the bead of unde sirable immigrants to this country. But in the effort to carry out the pol icy of excluding Chinese laborers, Chi nese coolies, grave injustice and wrong have been done by this nation to the people of China and therefore ultimate ly to this nation itself. Chinese stu dents, business and professional mett of all kinds, not only merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro fessors, travelers and the like, should be encouraged to come here and treat ed on precisely the same footing that we treat students, business men, trav elers and the like of other nations. As a people we have talked much of the open door in China, arid we expect, and quite rightly intend to insist upon, justice being shown us by the Chinese. But we cannot expect to receive equity unless we do equity. The Civil Service. Heads of executive departments and members of the commission have call ed my attention to the fact that the rule requiring a filing of charges and three days' notice before an employee could be separated from the service for inefficiency has served no good pur pose whatever. Experience has shown that the rule is wholly ineffective to/ save any man if a superior for im proper reasons wishes to remove him and is mischievous because it some times serves to keep in the service In competent men not guilty of specific wrongdoing. Having these factS in view, the rule has been amended by providing that where the inefficiency or incapacity comes within the personal, knowledge of the head of a department the removal may be made without no tice, the reasons therefor being filed and made a record of the department. The absolute right of removal rest* where it always has rested, with the head of a department. The change is merely one of procedure. It was much needed, and it is producing good re sults. Our copyright laws need revision. Philippines and Other Islands. During the last year the Philippine Islands have been slowly recovering from the series of disasters which since American occupation have greatly* re duced the amount of agricultural prod ucts below what was produced ID Span ish times. The agricultural conditions of the is lands enforce more strongly than ever the argument in favor of reducing the tariff on the products of the Philippine islands entering the United States. I earnestly recommend that the tariff now imposed by the Dingley bill upon the prodrcis of the Philippine Islands be entirely removed, except the tariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be reduced to 25 per cent of the present rates under the Dingley act that after July 1, 1909, the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced in the Philippine Islands be entirely removed and that free trade between the islands and the United States in the products of each country then be provided for by law. In my judgment, immediate steps should be taken for the fortification of Hawaii. This is the most Important point in the Pacific to fortify in order to conserve the interests of this coun try. It would be hard to overstate the Importance of this need. Hawaii is too1 heavily taxed. Laws should be enact ed setting aside for a ..period of, say, twenty years 75 per cent of the internal revenue and customs receipts from Ha waii as a special fund to be expended in the islands. I earnestly advocate the adoption oi legislation which will explicitly confer American citizenship on all citizens $t Porto Rico. I wish al^o to call the attention o the cougress to one question which af fects our insular possessions generally namely, the need of an increased lib erality in the treatment of the wholtf franchise question in these islands. I earnestly ask that Alaska be gives an elective delegate. Admission to Statehood. I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. The Panama Canal. Active work in canal construction, mainly preparatory, has been in prog' ress for less than a year and a half. During that period two points about the canal have ceased to be open to debate. First, the question of route second, the question of feasibility. The point which remains unsettled is wheth er the canal shall be one of several locks above sea level or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay before the congress at an early day the findings of the advisory board of American and European en gineers. In addition to sanitating the isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being provid ed for employees and an adequate sys tem of supplying tbem with wholesome food at reasonable prices has been cre ated. Hospitals have been established and equipped that are without superi ors of their kind anywhere. During the past year a large portion of the plant with which the work is to be done has been ordered. It is confident ly believed that by the middle of the approaching year a sufficient propor tion of this plant will have been in stalled to enable us to resume the work of excavation on a large scale. What is needed now and without de lay is an appropriation by the congress to meet the current and accruing ex penses of the commission. The first appropriation of $10,000,000 out of the $135,000,000 authorized by the Spooner act was made three years ago. It is nearly exhausted. Unless the congress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease.
