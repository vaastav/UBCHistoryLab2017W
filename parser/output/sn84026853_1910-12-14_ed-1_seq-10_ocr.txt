To familiarize the farmers with the work that is being carried on, the railroads have appealed to the banks ef the south in assisting tbem to distribute their pamphlets. The fol lowing letter has been sent to the bankers In this and other States that unvw uui jet useu tuvaueu ujr iue boll weevil: Gentlemen:?I enclose a copy of a circular letter addressed "to the farmers of the south" announcing the organization of the cotton cul ture department of the Southern Railway, the Alabama Great South ern Railroad and the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, and incorporating the ad rice of Dr. S.

'While the advice is intended pri marily for growing cotton under boll weevil conditions, the methods of soil preparation and cultivation are those that are recommended by Dr. Knapp for increasing the yield of cotton per acre, whether the weevil is present or not. They are, therefore, methods which I believe may advantageously be adopted by cotton growers throughout the south.

HAIL ORDEIi HOl'SE PROBLEM. Can Only Be Successfully Solved by the Local Merchant. lAfter all the problem of how to nccessfolly meet the mall order houses rests mainly with local mer chants. Of course In almost every place there are some people who will buy of mail order houses just be cause they have a craze for buying out of town, but the great majority of people are reasonable and fair and prefer to deal with home merchants. But they need to nave brought home to them in clear, unmistakable form the advantages which home tracing gives them. As a rule this is not done as It snould be. T.ie mail order firms send to almost ev ery home their big illustrated cata logues two cr three times a year, and these catalogues are got up in allur ing manner and are full of illusory bargains. The way for the home merchants to meet that Is bv keeping honest | goods upon their shelves and then tell the public about them In gener ous, alti v nU VCi I'.iat catches the eye. As a rule they do the first all right, b-:t their goods, hnworpp PYppllpnt. will remain on their shelves unsold unless customers are secured. Cotton Seed rrob!e:n. The Spartanburg Journal says if next spring there should be a May frost which would kill many of the cotton plants. seed would go to $1.00 m bushel. The hi^h price paid for seed this fall will make planting seed scarce next spring. Each farmer should 6ave at least two bushels of best seed for every acre he expects to plant, and then plant one bushel to the acre.

While we believe that the cotton crop of this year la a small one, yet tho pinner's report issued Thurslay shows the largest ginning up to De cember 1 of any year yet except 1908.

VERY SMALL CROP WILL NOT GO MUCH OVER TEN AND A HALF MILLION. The Southern Mills Had Better Wake Up to a Realisation of the True Sitnation. I There Is no doubt bat th&t the cotton crop of the present year Ib 1 short one. Even shorter than wag thought a few weeks ago. In a let ter to the Augusta Chronicle Mr. T. E. Massengale, of Norwood, Ga., givee good reasons to bear oat the above statement. Here 1b what he says: ' Convince a man against his will, is of the same opinion still." Some time back I wrote an article for your paper on the cotton crop, slating that the spinnable crop, or ci op from first ginning would not be over the amount stated above. And kow even with llnters and city crop it will not reach more than 11,000. GOO bales. City crop should nevr be counted. Neither should llnters. The city fcrop is nothing but samples having been pulled from bales al ieady weighed and which 'are sold and In warehouses?in transit or in the hands of spinners. And the weights of theae bales will show in the average weight of bales by Mr. Hester. And to count them again in which they again appear Is a prop osition that seems fishy. Llnters aie 1U for nothing that cotton is or can be used for, and should not be counted. But the bears are bard to con vince. They had set their hearts and hands on robbing the Southern planter by announcing a bumper crop from the opening of the sea son. And there ha? not been a oay since September 1st, that would have warranted a large yield. The l>ears, however, are beginning to come'down from 13 1-2 millions to 12 1-2 and 11 1-2 million?quite a fall. The last census bureau report ^hows bales cotton ginned 8,764,153. Now last year the same date cotton pinned 8,112,199, or 80 per cent of the crop that year, which waa 10, 072,731 bales. If the same ratio appertains again this season, of 80 per cent ginned, we have a crop of 10,517,063 bales, first ginning of rotton, and I can see no reason why hese figures should not prevail as rvery sensible person knows that a more propitious fall for gathering was never known, and the ginning facilities never better, and the price attractive. But suppose we go back to the ginning of 1908. When 9,695,809 wan ginned, leaving 27 per cent to be ginned (and this was a bad fall lor gathering.) The crop that year was 13,086,005. So if we take this year's ginning for this crop yet to be ginned at 27 per cent we only get a crop of 11,100,000 bales of cotton ,but I say that 1 a preposter ous. So I still Insist that I am emi nently correct, not only my premis33. but in my conclusions. If I bal one million dollars today 1 would invest In spot cotton so quick, " 'twould make your head swim." T*.o lowest estimate of the Augus ta cotton exchange this season wa? 10,650,000, identical with my fig ures. Two short crops coming or the heel.'i ^f the other means 20 cents cctton by March 1st, and that Mill be cheap. The total consump j.on or all kinds cotton during tne i 2 months ending August 31st W2.3 17,030,511 hales, over 1 1,200,000 oales of American was spun, and is that spun in 1009 over 12,000,000 or American. Where will the cotton come from to supply the demand? As there are 135,000,000 spindle? r.ow humming sweet music to ears of the world, where, oh! where, Jf he cotton coming from to keep the music going? The Southern mills hnd better ivake up to a realization of the fact tint there i? no more cotton in the folds to pick. They are as hare an they will bo March 1st. Ginning all over our country?having had gin ning days since November 1st, and the cotton being gathered up by the European spinners, the smartest ill men on earth. They call great, meetings (always in our cotton sountry) and pass resolutions that they will shut down before they will pay the price, and while the English ^punier lb nuneiuig aim mm, use, .ind our mill boys drawing thoir tnives to assassinate the farmer and raetor, the European spinner is c.uletly buying through his a rents the crcam of the ootton?leaving rur mill men to run around and get the tail end of the crop, and pay like i-Iades for that. This reminds me cf the story of the outlaws that called a meeting for prayer, and while the devout ones were down in the temple on their ltnecs praying for tVe brethren, the outlaws had lobbrd them of their earthly pos sessions and ran away.
