A message that contains so much, that so plainly shows the care with which the President prepared it and the hopes he has placed in it, is entitled to be studied and discussed section by section. One thought, however, will be immediate. At the present rate of progress, if all the legislation he proposes is to be put through, the present Con gress will have to work nights and Sundays and the President will have to call the Sixty-eighth Congress in special session as soon after March 4 next as it can get to Washington, prepared to stick it out all summer. "So many problems," the President declares, "arc calling for solution." Many of these same problems have been calling for solution ever since President Harding took of fice twenty-one months ago, with a Republican majority in Congress much more than big enough lo carry put the reconstructive promises upon which the Republican Party came into powei. Maybe the President has that in mind as he now piles upon Congress this formidable memo randum of work to be done. Maybe he'dcems it also a good way to impress upon the country the gap between all he would try to do and the little Congress has been willing to do. " - Maybe he thinks this big legislative prospectus may so startle certain Senators that they will be come dazed and permit to pass, almost without looking, a little thing like the Ship Subsidy Dill. What President Harding has staked on this mes sage is perhaps proportionate to what he has put into it. iTi7i aaafefeaCVih.. T nccles fail is a striking example. Th fly years ago a Sherlock Holmes might have becrVable to, "deduce" her path. It's harder now. , Thirty years ago she couldn't have traversed more than a moderate distance in a few hours. The number of trains she might have boarded would be limited. Horseback travel would have been' feasible only at night. The telephone and telegraph were in existence then and the alarm could have been flashed ahead. It is different now. The motor car, the motor boat and the aeroplane have multiplied the chances for temporary escape. The area in which the p'risoncr may be hiding is vastly expanded. Searchers must consider the land, the sea and the sky. Standardized motor cars and swift speeding aeroplanes leave few material clues. 

SINCE SHERLOCK HOLMES. , AUTHORS of recent detective fiction have made free use of scientific and mechanical novelties by detectives". Perhaps they have given too little attention to advantages gained by the criminals in even the short time since the creation of Sherlock Holmes. The escape of Mrs. Clara Phillips from the Los OUR TURN. IN considering the coal situation here the aver age New Yorker is not likely to pay much at tention to the news that coal shipment on the Great Lakes has ended for the season. - In ordinary years the lakes provide the great coal shipping highway for a big section of the North and Northwest. Lake rates on coal are low because coal provides return cargoes for the iron ore steamers fromDuluth and Superior. The econ omy of summer shipment insures a summer de mand from a territory where plenty of winter fuel is most necessary. The coal strike interfered with summer deliv eries. As a matter of fair play in dividing a sup ply that could not be sufficient in any event, the Lake trade got first preference. Shipments have been abnormally heavy since the strike ended. Now that these shipments have ceased New York and the East generally have this production to draw on. The weekly supply available for dis tubutibn in this territory will be increased by practically as many tons as have been going to the Lake ports. YONKERS GETS THE $2,000,000. rNKERS officials have provided the State with an excellent lesson. And the State will pay $2,000,000 for it. The lesson shows the absurdity of one of two things. Where the fault lies may be a matter of question. The State Constitution forbids special legisla tion for cities. Legislators anxious for special legislation evade the clear meaning of the law. The courts allow the legislators to get away with many of the attempts. An old law provides that any second class city adjoining any county wholly yithin a city need not surrender traffic fine funds to the State. Yonkcrs is the only city that qualifies under that "general" classification. The law is as clearly special legislation as though Yonkers were men tioned. Yonkers keeps $2,000,000 in traffic fines. New York City taxpayers will have to provide 70 per' cent, of the taxes that will need to be levied to make up for the Yonkers hold-out. It ought to be a valuable lesson. It costs enough. THE WEEK. WINTER has AKMVED and NEW YOItK Is re viewing tho COLD tacts of the COAL facta. Consumers must burn "substitute" grades of anthracite to piece out the supply of tho usual sizes. LAKE NAVIGATION Is CLOSING and THIS SEC TION will PnOFIT by a diversion of tho fuel that has been going to the Northwest. It Is a cold winter tor tho "FREE BOARDERS" who Imposed on Mrs. Lawcs, wife of tho Warden of SING SING. She packed them out. This did not ap ply to those who hold meal tickets Issued by Judges. M. CLEMENCEAU spent most of the week In WASHINGTON and visited with the PRESIDENT and EX-PRESIDENT. Washington, generally, was too busy oven for Tiger .baiting. 

CONGRESS sllppod from a SPECIAL SESSION to a REGULAR SESSION with scarcoly an Interruption. By yesterday PRESIDENT HARDING managed to set his MESSAGE together. From the number of fats proposals it is not surprising that the prepara tion took TIME. , In NEW YORK the INTERBORODGH promised MORE LIGHTS for SUBWAY 

CARS the FLICKER LESS kind, the sardines HOPE. THURSDAY'S STORM delayed Friday transit and caused Borious TRAFFIC JAMS. President Hedley forecasts prob-t able PROFITS for nest year and announces a new financing plan. Walter Christie's AMPHIBIOUS TANK climbed about tbo Palisades and then swam the Hudson. Bootleggers and Prohibition enforcers fear complica tions along the Canadian border. 

PROHIBITION ENFORCEMENT was to the fore In Congress with objection to a $9,000,000 SPONGE i to be applied to WET SPOTS. But that allows only 9 cents per capita or 18 cents per home brewer, it one estlmato is. correct. At MADISON SQUARE GARDEN they're going round and rbund tho SIX-DAY BICYCLE RACERS. NEW YORK POLICE have orders to MOP UP THE OASES on Broadway and caught one hlp-toter the first night. The METflODIBTS censured tho MOIST STAND of SENATOlt-EIiECT C OPEL AND. But the blast didn't dry him. ABROAD tho BIG EVENT of the week was the for mal transfer of power to tho IRISH FREE STATE, with TIM HEALY ns GOVERNOR GENERAL. Tho week1 was marred by REPUBLICAN- ASSASSINA TION of ono member of the DAIL and the wounding ot another. The FREE STATE retaliated with tho EXECUTION of FOUR REBELS, including RORY O'CONNOR and LIAM MELLOWES. KU KLUXISM is UNDER FIRE here and elsewhere. Judge Mancuso charged two Grand Juries to inves tigate and the American Unity League proposes to PUBLISH NAMES of lo.cal Klansmen. GOV, PAR KER of Louisiana suggests that a good treatment for Klsnlsm is to LAUGH at gTOwn men dressed in nighties, A PUZZLE, of the week is: If a Vermont girl can get $465,000 for alienation of a. husband, how much sb6uld the 150 wives of the ex-Sultan collect from the revolutionists who "alienated" the Sultan from his harem? MAYOR HYLAN has gone to CHICAGO to dellvor a PUBLIC ADDRESS. And perhaps a few words in PRIVATE for Mayor Thompson? ACHES AND PAINS 'A. wise guy says that nearly all men are as honest and truthful circumstances telH permit. The extermination of Irish by Irish goes on pret tily. The Emerald Isle evidently wishes to remain the most distressful country. Senator La Follelte and his bunch will have to Hurry if they mean to outfoot President Harding en a radical program. Hizzoner must Uke Chicago. He is off on another iritit. There is no accounting for tastes. The trouble about using fuel substitutes is that it means a lot of bother. A'cto, Yorkers hate to bother with things. Some would rather eat out of a trough than prepare a meat. When of old the Hellespont cut up rough Xerxes caused it to be lashed with chains. Koio the world is seeking to, keep it unchained. Coal goes a-begging with peopte begging or coal. It seems hard to ei'en things up In this life. 4 Jiut as one lady receives a verdict of $)S't,000 for the loss of her husband's affections a story comes of another who offered $10,000 to have her partner hilled. It's a wide variant.

The Duty to Intervenr. To th Udltor of The Kvenlnr World : The following is an extract from a mcssag-o delivered by Mr. McKlnley to tho Scnato at the beginning of the Spanish-American War: 'If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and human ity, to Intervene with force, it shall bo without fuult on our; part and only bocauso tho necessity for such action v.ill bo so clear as to command sup port and approval of tho civilized world." How bitterly theso words can bo made to apply to tho late war, and they can also be used to eflaco any doubt which may exist as to what America's reason waB for entorlne tho embroil. J. D. G. Uronx, Dec. 8, 1922. with regard to progress and accom plishment. As a Catholic, I can truthfully say, referring to a charge made time and time again by these bigots, that if .the Pope declared his Intention of tnvad ing America 05 per cent, of the 17 000,000 of Catholics In this country would refuse to help him in any way, but on the contrary would stand loy- nlly and faithfully by Old Glory and defend her against this kind of an enemy the same as they havo always r.tood by her In all her battles from tho Revolutionary to tho World War inclusive. Catholic people tho world over nro subject to tho Pope in a splr. Jtual way, but materially and politi cally they have no connection with htm whatsoever. ANTI-KU KLUX, Brooklyn, Dec. 5, 1922. Why They Act So. To the IMItor of The Evening World : Evidently Mr. Seo and ex-Captain of A. 13. P. have not associated with the best class of girls. I admit the majority of girls are In deed giddy, but whoso fault Is that? I find that no man cares to tako out a sensible girl who thinks seriously of a home. J. no alternative most gins have Is to act the way the men want them to. Men slander the giddy girl. but they all flock around the ono who Is most extreme. There are a good many sensible girls, far superior to the &ocalled flappers In every way. who aro left alone by young men beeauso they arc not "sports." I inn twenty-four and find all men alike. I have met a great many and speak from experience. I do not condemn the flappers. 1 have been tempted many times to fol low their methods, but a few girl friends (by the way college gradu ates) and mybelf have decided to live a good decent Uto even it we die old maids. There are many more llko us EX-SCHOOL TEACHBP.. Would nearnt an "Invaaton." To tha Editor of The Evening World- The New York Evening World Is to be highly commended on its policy of fearlessness in driving out into tho open thatiun-American, cowardly or unizatlon, the Ku Klux Klan. It is cothlng moro nor leb thaji a body es tablished to bring together and organ Ize the Ignorant bigotry and prejudice that has always existed in the South and certain parts of the West. It Is the continual prcpencc of this bigoted f-plrlt that kroii.s Southern cities lentil icpiescntativo of American cities, anil U Is the lack of this bigoted spirit In Nothor.i cities, especially New York, that puts them at the head of the list Standing; In Thentrea. To the Editor of Tho Evenlne World: As P. J. F. writes, why should not theatres in which all the scats arc occupied be compelled to put out n slgp. or havo the box office advice lhat there ore no .seats to be had? On soveral occasions, after my day's work I go to tho theatre, prin cipally for relaxation and rest, only to And after paying for tickets and gottlng inside that there nro no seats, and very often people stand Ing several deep ahead of me. I have waited at different times, anywhere from ten to forty-five minutes, and only n short tlmo ago had to stand through the entire show which, I can assure you, wasn't appreciated. I lived In Chicago for a number of years. There is no standing allowed Inside the theatres there, which is primarily a fire ordinance, and If I remember correctly was put into ef fect ahortly after tho Iroquois dls ister, and In my opinion should be made an ordlnanco"here. R. L. T. New York, Dec. 6, 1922. Trealdrnt llardlna; on tlir Klan, To (ha Editor of The Evenlne World : An "American of Five Generations" need have no fear of a "political in vation" by tho Ttoman Catholic Church. That church Is engaged en tirely In tho work of saving souls, the purposo for which it was Instl- tutcd by its founder, Jmub Christ, Your correspondent s statement that tho uttitudo of the President Is favorable toward the Ku Klux Klan is belled by tho following utterance of the head of otwcountry made on March 21, 1922: "In tho oxperlenco of a year of tho Presidency there has come to mo no other such unwelcome Impression ns tho ninnlfcbt religious Intoloram-o which pnIMh among ninny of our cltl zona.
