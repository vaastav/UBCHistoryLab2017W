Fort Dodge, Dec. 16.—A. E- Everett, of Bolfe. who claims the credit for causing the arrest of forty-two men charged with selling "wild horses" they did not own, is in the city today. Mr. Everett baa iust returned from Omaha where he jestifled in federal -.-ouri where eleven of the forty-two men are beirig tried. Jlr. Everett declares that postal i:i spectors already have uncovered losses aggregating J750.000 resulting to men who took bills of sale for "wild horses" lioor Flagstaff, Ar!2. The trials are j«.Ui on in Omaha.' Answered Advertisement. Mr. Everett declared he saw a "uiind" advertisement in a Des Moines paper and answered it. Correspond ence lasting six months or mor? was kept up between himself and A. U. Perry, of Atkinson, Neb. Perry, Ever ett declared today, has pleaded guilty to a charge of using the mails ro de fraud. This correspondence. Mr. Everett says, convinced him that the scheme was a swindle. He said he took the matter to George Bassett. of this city, then a postal inspector, and that Mr. Bassett took the matter up with the postal authorities in Omaha. Jlr. Ev erett says he was to trade one-half section of Kansas land owned by a client for 160 head of wild horses in Arizona. The Reife man said he made two trips to Omaha and met J. S. and Clyde A. Smith, said to b^. at the head Of the "United States Lire Stock Com pany." He kept the deal alive in vari ous ways until the federal* authorities were ready, to make arrests- On one trip to Omaha, the arrests were made. Mr. Everett said. The Bolfe man de clared that the federal authorities are trying to take all of the credit for worsting up the case when he himself penally furnished a great part of the evi dence. Mr. Everett declared that the sup posed horsemen tendered a bill of sale in exchange for a deed to the land The Iowan wanted the horses, how ever. and the deal did not go thru. He claims that if all of the other alleged victims of the game had demanded the horses instead of taking the bills of sale, that tbey would not have lost their money. The purchasers of the horses, according to testimony at Oma ha, tried to catch their animals, but the horses were too wild. & I Many Pathetic Cases. TeVtimony has brought to light many pathetic cases of alleged victims. One .•It man testified he lost his home -he traded for Some horses. An amusing incident in the trial, as reiated by Mr. Everett, was the ny •&,m***. reply that an attorney got when, somewhat angry, he cautioned a refractory witness to "hold your horses." "I have no horses to hold." replied the witness who had testified he had Transferred several thousand dollars' worth of property without getting any horses. Case Proves Costly. The costs in the case, it is figured, will be between J10.000 and $15,000. Xine county officials from Flagstaff have been taken to Omaha to testify as to the number of bills of .sale filed there. More than sixtv-rrine witnesses for the government and fifty for the defense have been subpoenaed. Mr. Everett declared that bankers, eminent business men and professional men have lost their money in the rr. .v-. —...m! UVUtC JAC mai .... .. posedly shrewd business men in Oma ha had lost a lot of money.
