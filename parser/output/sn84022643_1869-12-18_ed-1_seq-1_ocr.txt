METZLER Albany, Nov. 28, 1S6S-12 LOCAL AND GENERAL NEWS. Tira Pair Thing. Two honest mean- inhatrl working Teutons were engaged in splitting rails recently a short distanee from this city. " The contract called for ten feet rails.- U Some of the timber cat down were extremely tough; and hard to splitj'while others split with ease. These honest rail-splitters,. T wishing to do , the fair thing , by their , employer, cut the tough timber into lengths or cuts of nine feet, and that which split' easily into eleven feet length's. When the contractor or employer' came for the rails, he no ticed the difference in the length, and wanted to know if they called the1 mak ing of those ' nine ' feet rails- filling the contract ' for ten" feet " rails. With great simplicity, they narrated the facts as above related, stating that the number of inches lacking in the nine feet rati were: off-set by the extra inches in the eleven feet rail that the two rails to gether were twenty feet in length, which made an. average of ten feet per rail, and this average, they thought, filled their contract to the letter.

These blessings anu countless others are intrusted to your care and mine for the brief period of our tenure of office. In a short time we must each of ub return to the ranks of the people who have conferred upon us our pow ers, and account to them for the stewardship.' I earnestly desire thst neither you nor I .may be condemned by a frceand enlightened constituency, nor by our own cosseienccs. Wis are emerging from a rebellion of sigautie magnitude, aided as it was by the sympathy and assistance of natiuns with which we were at peace.- Eleven States of the Union were four1 years ago loft , without legal State governments ;' a debt had been? contracted ; American commerce was almost driven from the seas ; the industryof one-half the country had been taken from th control of the capitalists and placed where all labor rightfully belongs iir tho keeping of the laborers. The work of restoring State governments ' loyal to the Union ; the pro tecting and fostering of labor and providing means for paying fhe interest on the public debt have received amps attention from Congress. , 

CONDITION OF GEORGIA. . ' Although your efforts have hot met with the success in all particulars that inight have been desired, yet on. ths whole they; have been more successful than eould have been reasonably an ticipated. Seven ot the States which passed th ordinances of secession have been fully restored to their places in the Union. The eighth, Geor gia, has held an election at which she ratified a constitution republican in form, elected a Gover nor, members uf Congross,- and a State Legisla- turo, with all other offioers required. The Govcr I nor was duly installed.' and the Legislature met and pcriornied all the acts then required ot them by the reconstruction act of Congress. . Sabxc quently, however, in violation of the Constitution she bad just ratified, as since decided by the Su preme Court of the State, they unseated the col ored members of the Legislature, and admitted to seats members who' are disqualified by the third clause of the Fourttenth Amendment in the Con stitution, an article which, tbey themselves had contributed to ratify.; Under these circumstances I would submit tut you-whether it would not be wise without -delay to pass a law Authorizing the , Governor of Gsorgia to convene the members originally elected to the Legislature, requiring each member ts take tho oath preserilwd by the reconstruction act ; this done, those not to be ad mitted who are ineligible under the od clause of the 11th Amendment. ... . . The freedmeo, under the protection they have received, are making rapid progress it) learmng, and no eomplaints arc beard of a lack of industry on their part when, they receive a fair remunera tion for their labor. ' ' ' ' ' . The means nrovided" for paying the interest on tho public debt, with all other expenses, of the j Government, aro more than ample. Thu loss of ) our commerce is the only result of the rebellion which has not received "su8iojent atteulion from vou. To this subject I call your earnest atten tion.' I will not now suggest the means by winch : this object may be eff-cted, but will if neee.rv, I make it the subject of a special message during j the session of Congress. , , THE CSBECOXSTRrCTED STATK9. At the March term Congress by joint resolution authorized the Executive to order an election in the States of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, at which was to be submitted the Constitution which each bad previously in Convention framed,- and these were to be submitted either entire, or in separate parts to be voted upon, at the discretion of the Executive. Under this authority elections were called. In Virginia the election took place on the 6th of July, 189. The Governor elected has been installed. . The Legislature nu t and did all required by this resolution and by all the re construction acts of Congress-, and have refrained from all doubtful authority. I recommend that their Senators and Representatives be admitted, and that the State be restored to its place in the family of States. Elections were called in Slis sissippi and Texas to commence on the 30th of November, and to last two days in Mississippi and four in Texas. Tho eleitions have taken place, but tho result is not known. It is to be hoped that the Legislature of these States, when they meet, will bo such as to receive your approbation and thus close the work of reconstruction. ' THE Cl RtlESl-Y. Among the evUs growing ouof the rebellion, aud not ypt referred te. is that-of an irredeema ble currency. It is an evtt which I hope will re ceive your most earnest attention. It is a duty, one of the highest of the duties of the Govern ment, to secure to the people a medium., of ex change of unvarying value. This implies a re turn to a specie basis, and no substitute for it can. be devised. 2 It should be- commenced now and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to tho interest of the debtor class. Immediate- resumption, if practi cable,, would not b desirable. It would eompel the debtor class to pay beyond their contracts the premium on goli at the date of their purchase, and would bring bankruptcy and ruin to thous ands. Fluctuation, however, in the paper value of the measure of all value, gold, is detruiiental to the interest of trade. It makes the Mian of business an involuntary gambler f lor in all sale where future payment is to be made, both parties speculate as to what will be the value of the cur reuey to be paid and received..; ! earnestly ree ommend to yon, then, such legislation as will in sure a gradual return to specie payments and put an immediate stop to the fluctuation in the value of currency. The methods to secure, these m aults ar as numerous as are tho speculations on political oconomy. To secure the latter I see but one wayi and that is to erder the Treasury to re deem its own paper t fixed, prices whenever pre sented, and to withhold from circulation all such currency redeemed nntil sold again for gold. The vast resources of the nation, both developed and undeveloped, pught toJuake our credit the best on the earth. With a less burden, of taxation than the citrsen has endured for six years past, the entire public debt could be paid in ten years, but it is desirable that the people should not be taxed to pay- it in that time. Year by year the ability to pay increases in a rapid ratio, but the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly us can be done without violating the contracts. The public debt is represented in great part by bonds having from five to twenty and ten to forty years to run, bearing interest at the rate of S per cent, and per cent, respectively. It is optional with the Government to pay these bonds f any period after the expiration of the last tune men tioned unoa their face. The time has already ex pired whe Krea.patof them may be taken up, and the time is rapidly, approaching whou all may be. It is believed that all which are tiow due may be replaced by bonds, bearing a rater interest Tiotexceeduig per eent; and as rapidly as the remainder becomes due,' that theymay be replaced ta the same way." Te accomplish this, tt amy e neeeeiiary authorie interest to be paid at either of three or four of the momiy eeutree of Europe or by y- Assistant Treasurer pf the United States. at the option of the holders of the bonds. I recommend this snbjeet to the conaid erationef ICeagrese simultaneously with this, the propriety of redeeming our currency as before suggested at its market value at the time the law goes Into effcetr tBcrcaaing the rate at which ewrrepey wiU be bought of told rrom day to day or week to week at the , same rate of inter est as tho Government pays po i' biradt.. The subject of tarill uud iutciuul Uiatiou will Beeea. sarily receive your, attention. The revenues, of the country ere greater than the requirement, and miy :vrrt. safety be redoced; bat as the funding of the debt in four or four and a half per cent, bonds would reduce the annual current ex pense largely; "and then after funding, .justify a greater reduction of taxation than would be now expected IT suggest the postponement of. this question until the next meeting of Congress, when it may be advisable to modify taxation and the tariff in instances where unjust and burdensome discriminations -are made by the present 'laws. But for a geueral revision of the laws regulating this subject, I recomineml the postponement of it for the present. 1 I also Suggest the renewal of tax on incomes,, but at. a reduced rate, say..f three per cent,, thbt Xul t expire in three years. With theTundng Of the National debt t feel safe in saying that, the ftasea and revenue' froja :fan-ports-may; be safely xedpeed from sixty to eighty millions per annum at .once, and a still further reduction from year td year,, as the resources of es 1. t it btiida the. country are ievIopea i . .

The receipts in .the Treasury, beyond the expenditures, have exceeded the atnonnt nec essary to place to, the credit of, the sinking funds as provided by law..

TFBAX QUESTION. - v " .i As tho United States is the freest of all nations, so its people sympathize with all people strug gling for liberty ami self-goveruineiit.: But while so sympathizing, it is due to our. honor that, we should abstain from enforcing onr views upon un willing nations and front .tahjig ab .iuterettgd part in iuitiatory quarrels between, different na tions, between' different Governments " and their subjects. . Our course should always bei .iu trrot conformity with strict justice and international law. Such has been the policy of the- adminis tration iu dealing with these questions. Por more than a year a valuable province of Spain -a near neighbor ot ours, in whom all Our people Cannot but fuel a deep , interest -has been struggling for its independence aud freedom. The . people .and Government of the United States, en tertuHi the sume warm sympathies for the people of Cuba in their pending strucele that thev manifested in the previous Struggle between -rpir-urHl tieVcWoniesr-' in benall ot ttio latter, nut rtne coutrfcs at no time have assumed the couditions which amount to. war in the scuSe of international law, or which would show the existence of : political :organixa tion of ieaurgeuts sutficienl to justify a recognition of their bclliirereucy. The principle isiuuintained, however, that this natiou is to be its own judge as to the rights of belligerency, cither to a people struggling to free themselves from a Government eign commerce-of the country, in tho deci ease rand transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine, in the prolongation ot our-war, and the increased cost, both in trensnro and lives, for its suppression could not be adjusted and satisfied as ordinary commercial claim which-continually arise betweou commercial nations ; and yet the convention treated them simply as such ordinary claims from which they differ more widely in the gravity of their character than in the magnitude of their amount, great even as that is. . ,'J .J.'.'- : . J " RKni-ItOriTY WITH CAXAOA. . There was found a wide difference of opinion a to the rooiproeity treaty between the ll'uitcd States and the British provinces' "on this conti nent whieb has not been favorably considered by the administration. The advantages of such a treaty would ie wholly in favor of the British producer, except, possibly,, to a lew engaged in tho trade between the two sections. No citizen reciprocity.

The offer not being ac cepted by Spain on a basis which was believed could be received by Cuba, it was withdrawn. - It it hoped that the good offices of the United States may yet.prove advantageous for the settlement of this unhappy struggle. Meanwhile a number of illegal expeditions against Cuba have been broken up.

The question of the seiz ure of the brig Mary Lowell atone of the' Baha ma Islands. by the Spanish authorities is near the subject of correspondence between this Govern ment and that of Spain and Great Britain. The Captain General of Cuba! about May last issued a proclamation authorising a search to be made of. vessels on the high teat.

Our neighbors tooth of the United States, and f, J"Pn, should receive speoal attention. - It wiU be the endeavor of my administration to cultivate tuck relations with all nations to be entitled to their confidence, and make them inter ested in establishing better commerce! relations than that hetetotore pursued toward China. It it due to the capacity and efforts of onr own dis tinguished citizens that the world it about to com mence largely increased relations with that popu lous and heretofore exclusive nation. At tha United Statea have been the initiators of tha iml- icy they should be the most earnest in showing their good faith, making it a success. In this connection I advise such legislation at will for ever preclude the enslavement of the Chinese npon our toll under the name of coolies, and to prevent American vessels from engaging in the transport ation of any coolies to any country, or tolerating the system. I also recommend that the Misaitui to China be raised to one of the first class, . ;.f THB OBJECTS Of TIIB ADMINISTRATION. ' ' On my assuming the responsibilities of Chief Magistrate of the United States, it was with lira conviction that three things were essential to Its peace and prosperity and the fullest development. First among these is strict integrity in fulfilling our obligations ; second, to secure protection to the person and property to the citizens of our common eon n try. wherever be may chance to move, without reference to original nationality, religion, color or politics, demanding uf him obe dience to the law and proper respect for the rights of others ; third, the union of all the States, with rightt undisputablo by any but Constitutional means. To secure the first of these Congress bat taken two essential steps in declaring by joint resolution that tho public debt should be paid, principal and interest, in coin ; second, by pro viding I he means for paying the principal. How ever, we could not secure the object desired with out tho proper administration of laws for collee. tion of revenues, and economical disbursement of them. To this subject the administration bat most earnestly addressed itself with results I be lieve satisfactory to tho country. There hat been no hesitation iu changing officials iu order to secure the efficient execution of law ; sometimes, too, where in a mere party view the political re sults that were following from any hesltatioa in sustaining sufficient officers against rvmone. fiances wholly political. It may be well to men tion here that embarrassment may possibly arise from leaving on tho statute book the to called tenurc-of-ofnee acts, and do earnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been tbe intention of the framersof the Constitution when uruvidins that appointments made by theJ I dent should receive tbo assent of the Senate; I that the latter should hare power to retain iu j ottiee persons displaced by Federal appointments against tbe will of the President. Tbe law it inconsistent with a faithful and efficient admin is. , trntion of the; government. What faith can the j Kxecutive put in officials forced upon him those,, i too, whom hof hat suspended for reason 7 How would such officials be likely to serve the adminis tration, which tbey know does not trust them t For the second requisite to our growth and proa peri ty, time and m firm but humane administra. tion of existing laws amended from time to time, as they may prove ineffectual or harsh orunnecet. sary, are probably all that it required. The third cannot be obtained by special legislation, but must be regarded as fixed by the Constitution itself, and gradually acquiesced iu by tbe force ef public opiuiuu. . 

IXKIAS AFPAIKH. ,r- 1ir.m tlin ftitimli, ti.in ol' tlij, vimnmMl tn ft! .present time the management ot tlie original in habitants of this coutincut, the Indians, hat been attended with continuous robberies, murder and wart. From my own experience, when on the frontiers and in the Indian countries, I do not 1 hold either the legislation or tlie conduct of the whites who came nearest iu coutuct with the Iu. diuus, blameless. These deeds of the past, how, ever, cannot be undone, and tho question mutt be met as we now find if. I have, adopted a new policy towards these wards of tho nation. - They mnniil lio regarded in anv ether liirht than aa ' wurds. It has been attended with very , fair I n. .nits an far aa baa beeeu tried, and I hnlie wilt I be attended ultimately with the greatest aueeear. Tbe Society uf inenVs are well known at having succeeded iu peace with Indians in the early aeU tiement of Pennsylvania when their white neigh bors of other sections were constantly em broiled 4 Tbey are also known for. their opiositiou to nil violence,. strife and war, and are generally noted fur their strict integrity and. fair dealing. Thee considerations induced. ne to give tbe manege men t of a few Reservations of Indiana to tbm, and to throw tha but di n of the selection ef agents upon the Society itself,. The result hat prove.! most satisfactory. , It will be found more fully set forth in the report of the Commissioner of In dian Affairs and of tho Superintendents. For Indian Agents nut on Reservations, officers of the army were selected. ...The reasons fr this are nu merous. Tho Indian Agent! are tent here and there. Troops mutt he sent also. The Agent and commander of tuo troops are independent of each other, and are subject to orders from differ, cut departments of the government. The army .fUcr holda a .position fur life $, the agent, one at the will of tbe President, Tho former is person ally interested in living in harmony with tbe In dians and tbe- establishment or permanent peace, to the end that tome portion of hit life may be spent within the limits of the civilized section. The latter has no such personal interest. An. other reason Is an economic one, and stil another it the hold which the government has upon tba life of the officer to secure the faithful discbarge uf hi duties iu carrying out a given policy. The building of the railroads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and mineral regions of their country is rapidly bringing civilized set tlements in contact' with nil the tribes of Indians, and not matter what ought to be tbe relations be. tween-such settlements and the nboriginecs, tho fact is tbey do not harmonize well, and one or the Other bos to give way in the 01 d, A system which looks to the extermination of a race is too horrible for any nation to adopt without entailing upon itself the wrath of all Christendom and en. gendering in the citizen a disregard for human life and tlie rightt of others dangerous to society. I see no substitute for such a system except m placing all the Indians on large 1 rescrvat ions aa rapidly at can he done and giving them fi" protection there. As soon as they are it they should be induced to take their lands la acvcralty. e4 to set P,3 Zn S,r their own protection.
