Vr to date 110 Republican statesmen throughout our beloved land are reported to have a sure thing on the eight Seats in , Mr. McKinley’s Cabinet. Mr. Hanna is now in a position tn realize the size of the white elephant lie has on his hands, in the shape of an obstinate and obstructive Congress. . _ o - Tin; professional nim-mtiis ami Christ mas pood will of journalism, are forcibly illustrated in Louisiana, where one editor lias just shot another oin to de ;h on tin' street. Mn. Wji. Jknmxos liIiYAN will not lecture at Knston, Md., htc.un hi- mana gers exact three fourths of the hall receipts, which must amount to at- least y ~00(1.on. That class of eloquence is too high priced tor the Eastern Shore. Major Hilly Stewart is fully competent to take Mr. Bryan's place. StxATolt ' n rv expresses himself as opposed to any more millionaires and husi men in the Senate. What we need in the Senate worse than i any thing else about this time are brains anil honesty. It a Senator has these, wealth “is no objection to him.” Without them, money cannot justify ins presence in that body. Mr. Bayard has declined to receive a Christmas gift from the English people made up by popular shilling contributions as projected by the London Telegraph. This whole transaction is a mortifying episode in the career of our Embassador at ■the Court of St. James, and the one great pity is, that Mr. Bayard did not hurry to decline this penny-in-the-slot-contribution, when it was lirst suggested by the Tele graph. Mr. Bayard has so continuously gushed and slushed, over the English aristocracy, and in at least two speeches—one at Bos ton, and the other at Edinburgh, has not spared harsh criticism of his own country men, that the mortification of the hour is really the looked for result of his own ex cessive Anglomanias!)). Bkcausk we have enough trouble with the ignoramuses already in the country we want no more illiterate immigrants dumped upon us by foreign steamship lines. Year by year the tide of immigration lias ■ become swoolcn, until to-day it consti tutes a menace to American habits of life. The educational test is now before Con gress in the shape ol the Eodgc-Corliss bill, which provides, that every imigrant shall he aide to read live lines of the lan guage be speaks. The bill ought to pass, because it aims to exclude only those ignorant of their own language, who have no occupation, and no conception of American standard-, or Amer ican institutions. A SILVER BLOCKADE AGAIN. The refusal of Senators Dubois, Mantle, I’cttigrcw, Cannon and Squires to enter the Republican caucus in the Coiled Stales Senate, on Tuesday, virtually settles tin* question whether any larilf or revenue legislation is to lie passed at the present session of Congress. It leaves no room for doubt as to the fate of the Dingley bill, even if the Republican Senators in the caucus were more disposed \than they are to give it an active support. The action of the silver Senators shows I that they are ready to renew the blockade .in the last session against all financial lolls which are not based on a concession to the ' Aver interest, x Mte action of the silver Senators is also Mirant of tiro extreme difficulty which \be encountered in shaping tariff or] W hills in the Fifty-fifth Congress, j \shall hold together in their present j \ the McKinley administration will Vlent on the sound money Demo te Senate for the legislative en- j \ any policy which it may adopt V to the silver interest. j 

WOMEN BACHELORS VS. SPIN- ! STERS. I While women as a sex are undoubtedly | rapidly advancing along all the lines of a progressive and cultured civilization, yet ; along with her evolution, are being devel oped some affectations which the ill-natured may properly term weaknesses. The substitution of the title “Bachelor” for that of “Spinster,”ns descriptive of un married women, is one of the affectations to which the uneducated ear has not yet grown accustomed. It is, of course, an advanced word, limi ted as yet to the special circle of the Si rosis or woman's Literary Club,and not yet current in the rural districts. But if sanctioned as a fashionable fad in the city social centres,it will certainly soon find place in the provincial vocabulary. But whether the word Bachelor shall fi nally supplant the familiar old title of Spin ster or not in these evolutionary times, it is noticeable at least, how obsolete the latter word has grown. ()nce, properly applicable to the unmar ried woman of tender as well as more ad vanced years, its limited use is now by common consent restricted to the special class of females, who have not been connu bially inclined, or to whom untoward cir cumstance lias denied the blessing of ma ternity. We mourn the loss of the poetic old word which associateswith it the romantic distaff, and the winsome maiden at her wheel. Indeed it has come to pass, that you risk an affront in its use, which circles moat re fined, not to say courtly, once fully sanc tioned. Only recently on the streets of Elkton, a feminine “Bachelor” of no uncertain age, insisted most vehemently that the term Spinster was inapplicable to her. That it was a term limited by time and usage to her more experienced sisters. As to the obsoleteness of tire word she was correct, but she was no less a spinster, because heiself a young unmarried female. Commenting at once timely and perti nently mi tills theme,at Exchange deplores ' the fact that the useful old word “Spinster” | has fallen upen decadent days,few counten ancing its use save in the marriage service, nr on legal documents. People prefer in- j stem! to t-ili: of women bachelors, which an old Euclid would say, is an absurdity. This i •dislike to a perfectly legitimate word show a singular weakness on the part of women j who are proclaiming tiicir strength. An , I tinmaTneil woman is u spinster whether ■ she calls herself "bachelor” or something i else. This protest has been suggested In an article in “Scribner’s Magazine,” writ- I ten by Mary (lay Humphreys, and called] “ W omen Bachelors in S' Vor k.” Save ! the exception of the lirst two words in the I title, we have no quarrel with what is really j an interesting paper. How very true are j the following remarks: “Women used to save; now they earn. Formerly when they had to fa hard tb.ies they retrenched in Servants, did their own work, cut down the table, the fires, made their own clothes. The literature of the last generation is largely a history of small economies. Women might go hungry, but their heads were high, and their fingers were as blue as their blood.” Now, if losses come, women set about earning money themselves rather than relinquish any of life’s little luxuries, Tlie New York woman, it seems, has a wider knowledge of the world than her Southern or Western sisters. Consequently, when she has to earn her living she casts about for something original instead of confining herself to the old feminine ways. HOW IT RETURNS TO PLAGUE THEM. Our readers will remember, that at the opening of the last Congress, the Republi can members of the Senate, not being in a majority over both Democrats and Popu lists, in order to control the chairmanships of the different Senate Committees, and to realize individually a larger share in the distribution of Senatorial patronage, by an agreement with the Populists, who held the balance of power in that body, practically surrendered the control of the Senate Finance Committee. While this agreement gave the Republi can Senators the control of the organiza tion of the committees, they assumed the duties and responsibilities of a majority, without possessing its power. They were still in a minority, and arc to-day practically unable to accomplish any legislation in that body. Referring to this anamolous condiuon of affairs in the Senate, the Washington cor respondent of the Philadelphia Ledger, very pertinently says: “It was an unwise move, which had only as its basis the desire for the emoluments am! perquisites of committee chairman ships ami an increased share in the distri bution of patronage in the Senate wing of the Capitol. It was accomplished only by the refusal of a number of Populist Sena tors to vote, which gave to the Republicans ; $ m Absolutely Pure. | A cream of tartar baking powder.

IS9S. : an apparent majority upon the roll-call. | The transaction was denounced as a deal at i the time it was made, and Senator Clorman, | in a vigorous speech, predicted " ith un failing accuracy the embarrassments which nominal but unreal power would entail upon the Republican side of the Senate. As a result, the fact that the Republicans have been in an actual minority in the Senate instead of in the majority, as their control of the committees would indicate, has been entirely unappreciated by the general public, and all of the embarrass ments predicted by the Democrats as the resuit of the deal for patronage have been fulfilled. The Diugley bill, passed by the j House, came from the Senate Finance Com mittee, with its Republican Chairman, transformed into a bill for the free and unlimited coinage of silver, all attempts to pass revenue legislation at the last and long session of Congress utterly failed, and the Republican leaders are now forced to admit that any similar attempts at the present session will be quite as fruitless and inconclusive. With the continuing deficiency in the revenues and with such a condition of affairs existing in Congress, an extra session seems inevitable. It is the appreciation of these facts which is respon sible during the past week for the general consent of prominent Republican Congress men that President McKinley will be forced to convene the Fifty-fifth Congress in extraordinary session soon after the dis solution of the present Congress on the Ith of March next. THE 

PRESIDE NT’S MESSAGE. President Cleveland’s last message to Congress was read in that body on Monday. Although rather ponderous and Cleveland esque in style, it is nevertheless an able state paper, considered from the President’s political standpoint. The message opens with a congratula tion to the country on the patriotic results of the recent election, and the manly sub mission of the defeated t< the pm ml w ver dict. The Venezuelan question ha\ing ■ n , practically settled, the President's review* ■ foreign rehui to Turkish and Cuban alTdrs. On the latter, lie reveals the* fact lha: the Admin- ' istration has broached a j , m - :M ’i to Spain in favor o? the concession of home I nil • to tin* Cubans, and proll’eii the* friendly I offices of this count.y ia securing that ] result. I None but extreme free tie h-rs will agree j with Mr. Cleveland in the opinion, that I under normal business eoudii. ; the j present tariff Dill will afford sufficient I revenue for the country. On the monetary question tin* IV ideal I simply repeats what he h . often said b - ) fore in endorsing Mr. Carlisle’- proposi j tion for the retirement *•! the gr< nine . while he winds up his reference to economic topics with the characteristic arraignment I of trusts and monopolies, in which n definite conclusion is reached beyond the - suggestion that if Federal authority is insufficient to deal with them, the several States by their own laws should be aide to I act effectively in the premises. The other parts of the message are of routine character, and outside of the Cuban discussion, are not likely to make any par ticular impression on either Congress or the country at large. Tours to California. California hits been moat fittingly termed the'Ttaly of America.’ 1 All the delicious balm, the cloudless sky, and the rich verdure of the great European peninsula are duplicated in this sunny laud of the Pacific. Hero nature basks in the sunshine of her own beauty: and hero she has established her own sanitarium, where eternal spring inspires everlasting youth. With the snowmautled peaks of the Sierras upon the one hand, the calm Pneifle with its soft breezes upon the oilier, and a veritable paradise of flowers, fruits, and plants between, man can find and needs n< lovelier laud. To visit such a country is a privilege, a blessing. The Pennsylvania Railroad ('ompany.recog nizing the need of a more comfortable and pleasant way of crossing the continent, in augurated a series oi annual tours to Cali fornia, running a through train of Pullman palace cars from New Voi'k to the Pneifle Coast, and stopping at the principal points of interest en route. The great popularity of these tours demonstrates the wisdom of the movement. For the season of 1897 three tours have been arranged to leave New York, Philadelphia. Pittsburg, January 27. February 2-1, and March 27. The first tom will run direct to Kan Diego via St. Louis and the Santa Fe Rout' l , and re turn from San Franci< * > via Salt Lake City, Denver, and Chicago, allowing live we ks in ('alii'ornia.

When most needed it is not unusual for your family physician to be away home. Sm h was the experience of Mr. J. V. Schenck editor of the Caddo, Ind. Ter., Banner, when his little girl, two years of age was threatened with a severe attack of croup. He says: “My wife insisted that I go for the doctor, but as our family physician was out of town i I purchased a bottle of Chamberlain's Cough Remedy, which relieved her immediately. 1 will not be without it in the future.” 25 and 50 cent bottles for salo by R.
