BILLS COLLECTED MONTHLY. C. D. MILLS, Manager. DECEMBER 6, 1907 What's the use of disputing about "love at first sight," when they say that "love is blind." Only the .man who is trying to live down a bad reputation can really sym pathize with the poor fellow trying to live up a good one. One thing most of us were thankful for last Thursday was the fact that every pleasant day makes our winter one day shorter. Report advises us that a harp 414 years old has been discovered in Iowa. Perhaps it is the one which traveled through Tara's Halls. A London dentist says that kissing is injurious to the teeth. He must be wrong. Some of our prettiest girls have excellent teeth. A Chicago chemist lately succeeded in extracting a deadly poison from the air, report says. As it evidently was Chicago air, the feat loses a great deal of its mystery. IT you care a rap about the comfort of your fellow man or fellow woman, do your Christmas shopping early. From now on until Christmas at least, father will not do overmuch "hoarding." In conection with the spread of the prohibition sentiment, never mind fret ting about the farmer he'll find plenty of use for his corn. It is worth more put into hogs of the four-legged variety than it is in liquid form put into the two-legged sort. An Alabama philosopher has put the whole liquor question in a nutshell. He says the people have the entire matter of the liquor traffic under their direct control. All they have to do is to stop drinking, all of them, and then there won't by any traffic, and there it is all nicely settled for all time. It seems a very simple problem after all. The Devils Lake Journal celebrated Its first birthday last Monday, it being just a year since the weekly was mer ged into a dally. However, we haven't seen Bloom passing around any cigars. He might, at least, have loosened up to the. extent of a couple of simoleons, I-1S 1 H. WHIPPLE Vice President Capital, Surplus, ROTTTIEB Cuhbn $75,000 $35,000 Farm Loans negotiated through the Union Oentral Life Insurance Co., of Cincinnati, Ohio. Partial pay ments permitted at any time and made his brother editor glad at heart. Possibly we're on the wrong side of the fence, but—banish the thought! The only spirit wanting at the late insurgent obsequies was Bill Ander son. If Bill had been present, the mugwump republicans would surely have been electrified by one of Ander son's rapid fire, pyrotechnical speeches. Bill's long on speech-making, and in our humble opinion, a serious mistake was made in not appointing him a del egate from this county. Hot air is what the insurgents like. It is understood that a movement is on foot at present to give John Mitch ell, the retiring president of the Mine Workers union, a purse of $18,000 as a free will offering. Each member of the union will be asked to contribute five cents. Wonder if Boss Winship could be induced to retire from the Herald under like condition, his sub scribers each contributing. We see them jumping and falling over each other to do it, they love him so. Col. Bloom, our honorable and es teemed contemporary, pilot of the des tinies of the Family Educator, the Devils Lake Journal, seems to think that we should explain the matter of Roosevelt's issuing fresh bonds while the treasury contained $904,000,000 in gold. Really, we haven't room this week, Bro! Bloom. We are printing the president's message IN 

FULL, but if you wait until next week, patiently, patiently, mind, we will try and oblige you. In the meantime try and absorb the intricate points of the money question. We understand that William H. An derson of this city is being talked of as a posible candidate on the insur gent slate for attorney general. We will heartily commend this action of the above mentioned wing of the sel ection of Mr. Anderson is made, for, in our belief, no better material than Bill Anderson for atorney general can be found in the state, be he insurgent or otherwise. He is a fellow towns man of ours, a royal good fellow and above all, a man capable of filling the position with credit to himself and to the party that elects him. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We present to our readers this week the full text of the president's message to the Sixtieth Congress. It will be found in section two. To say the least, we think that the presentation of the full text speaks well of our paper, and is indicative of the healthy growth and progress of the Inter Ocean during the past To undertake to print a sixteen page paper, within the past few years, even, would be a Herculean task, but with the help of our advertisers, and oar subscribers at large, we have been able so to do. We feel sure that it will be appreciat ed by our large circulation of readers. The message is laden with good tid ings, reports and advice as to the wel fare of our country. Mr. Roosevelt, in no uncertain words, says that dishon esty must be eliminated from our in ternational and state politics. In that, we heartily (and who does not?) agree ON, or about December to, I will Open a Store in the New Flynn Block with a complete and Up-to-date stock of Watches, Diamonds £nd Jewelry* You will do ^ell to do your" Christinas sshdpping with me, mm* mamm with him. He denounces monopolies, and no one who has kept pace with his past actions can question him in this, child and woman labor he de cries, and recommends the lifting of duty on wood pulp. He says the Sher man law, relating to interstate busi ness, should be amended to admit of the proper combinations of business methods. He speaks extensively of the currency, and says that the elastic ity of such is a positive necessity. The army and the navy come in for a large share of criticism, and he recom mends that the higher promotions be by selection. Several new laws are earnestly recommended. In all, the president's mesage is a good one, and demonstrates the author to be not only a writer of no mean ability, but also a profound thinker. Don't you think so?
