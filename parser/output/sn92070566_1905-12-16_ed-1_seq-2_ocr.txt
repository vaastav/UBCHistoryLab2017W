Mr. Andrew Carnegie's opin ions upon t lie results of the re cent elections and the insurance scaMtsJi are worth reading. Tliey are as follows: Of all things we should invar iably have an honest count. I ilo not think that any attempt to defraud the people out of a fair count could ever lie sueef ful, for the voice of the people will make itself heard. I believe that this republic is immortal, and it matters not what troubles it is confronted with it will come through with foundations un shaken. You can always trust the people- They demand and will have a square deal. Their voice is going to be heard, and when they are interested they usually vote right. There is hardly a municipality in -England that does not control its gas, its tramways, water sup ply and sewerage. Whatever is increased in value by the in crease of population of a city should belong to the city. The people should not give away their franchises. Whether it "is advisable for them to operate public utilities is of small im portance. As to the giving away of franchises, a city should be in a position not giving them away to take them back. The leases which should be given should be for as short a time as possible, the shorter the better. The ownership should always remain with the city. There is nothing so purifying as public opinion. There will be cases of jobbery under munici pal ownership here as there are now. but this must ce&se as a result of public opinion. This insurance ail'air has made a profound impression through out Europe. It is amazing that Americans are willing to lend their good name to financial ins titutions where they cannot or do not have time to perform their duties. They are simply decoy ducks. The men we need are those that can lend their money and their good names, too, and guard both jealously. To control such evils we should have men in office who are not money grabbers, who have re tirei! from business and who will conduct their public offices as they would their own private business. Our business and moral stand ing has been lowered in the es timation of Europe by the dis closures in the insurance inves tigation. GROWTH OF TREE PLANTING (Prom an exchange.) A subject ever old and yet al ways new, one which more and more each year draws the atten tion of men and women and children, not only ill our cities where their value is untold, but also in our country places we are beginning to realize the wonder ful value of trees, tree growth, and tree preservation. It is a strange fatality of our Western civilization that we lirst destroy what nature has so abundantly given us, then after we have wasted our forests in riotous destruction, we begin to repent like the prodigal son, and lament the grand old trees of such marvelous beauty, such wonderful proportions which we have so wantonly cut down. The young forest, sprouts from old stumps, wild shrubs, plants, llovera and weeds as well, be come the things sought after. It is true of trpe life as with other matters pertaining to our I To Cure a CoM in One Day izsu 1 I Take Laxative BrOmO Quinine Tablets. Jr?A on every! glanoa This sisnatnre,- áWt aW.25 Maak.

The more advanced civiliza tion lecoines, and the more we understand what the loss of trees means, the more we lament their destruction and the more anxious we are to replace them. These tree planting societies all over the land, these studies of nature now being instituted in all our schools are grand stepping stones to practical tree planting. What to plant, how to plant when to plant, and where and how to properly handle, are all subjects that can not too often be told to the people, for it is truly deplor able how little is known about these matters by many of our people. One point, however, all are learning, and that is the im mense value of any and all trees planted in California, either for ornament, shade, timber, or fuel. As was, or might have been ex pected, the President's message to the Congress didn't suit nor please anti-administration newspapers and many Democrat ic journals. We suggest that in case Mr. Roosevelt writes an other message that he let the howlers do it and Mr. Roosevelt do the criticising, if so then, as in this case, Mr. Roosevelt would be the star of interest. Ton can safely bet on it that the source of criticism on the Pres ident's message is also the source of socialism. Anti-administra-tionists, socialism, anarchists, and a big chunk of the latter day saints of Democracy are against anything and everything just for the sake of being out of joint or for the lack of patriotism and loyalty. The Dallas Morning News' leading editorial against the President's message was a mag nilicient display of editorial mechanical ingenuity only this and nothing more. 

ALCOHOL AND CONSUMPTIVES Pure Air, Sunlight, Good Food and Rest. New York, Nov. 2S. Con sumption is curable, according to Health Commissioner Darling ton, who spoke at the opening of the American tuberculosis ex hibition last night. "The first thing," said Dr. Darlington, "to do in combating tuberculosis is to educate. Con sumption is curable. Of the cases which we have taken in the last stages X per cent recov-1 ered and per cent were able lo return to work, of school children examined 48 per cent have something the matter with fhem and many are open to con sumption. The board of health is trying to persuade the people not to buy patent medicines. It is no good. People trust in such medicines until it is too late to save them. Patent medicines are largely aleooliol stimulants. The use of alcohol is death in tuberculosis. If people would leave alcohol alone they would greatly decrease the rate of death among consumptives. Only four things are necessary in the treatment of this disease sunlight, fresh air, good food and j re8-" Joe Jenykewsklp TAILOR. Is prepared to make Fall and Winter 8UIT8. Una Frank Heneycatt.

W.-Tlie St. Petersburg correspondent of the Vossische Zeitung, who talked for live hours with representative leaders of all political and social classes outside the court circles, cables by way of Stockholm un der yesterday evening's date as follows : "C o n tí d e n c e in Premier Witte's -cabinet is disappearing in political and commercial cir cles, since it is growing daily more evident that Witte is with out the necessary powers from the emperor. These circles be lieve rightly that General Count Ignatietf's influence is growing. Partisans of the reactionary In terior Minister Dumovo confirm ed to me the statement that lrince Tcherbatotf is organizing a loyal militia and added that Dumovo and Tcherbatoir are trying to force matters to such an extreme that at a given mo ment they can fall upon the Liberals with this temporary militia. These classes designate Dumovo as Witte's successor. "In a very few days a crisis must decide whether the auto cracy will be resurrected. "Socialists are very optimistic. They hope soon to spread a gen eral strike all over Russia ex cept in Poland. They regard all the technical troops as pledged to them. Of tho other troops they do not yet trust the divi- sion of, guards. "The . Socialists say that the activity of the Reactionists J.

They assert that they have no doubt that the proletariat will be supreme in St. Petersburg within a very short time, al though only part of the lower officials of the post and telegraph departments have hitherto join ed the strike. The railway op eratives will also strike soon be cause Burnovo arrested their re presentatives contrary to the government's promise. In some quarters there is a de mand that the emperor come to St. Petersburg and issue a man ifesto to the peaceable elements. It seems to me that the moment for this has passed. The em peror's entrance into the city could only lead to a catastrophe which may be postponed or per haps be avoided by his remain ing at the palace. "According to my personal conviction the situation grows hourly worse. Events cannot be stayed and new bloodshed is un available since the Reactionists and Socialists alike wish it. The imperial house and the bourg- eoise will be the losers."
