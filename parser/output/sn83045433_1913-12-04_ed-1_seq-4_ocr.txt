A Word in Your Ear, Senator Owen We have been wondering for some days now why it was that Senator Owen, in opening the debate on the currency bill, permitted himself to indulge in that exploded fallacy about the panic of 1907. What he said was that that cataclysm was "a part of a concerted plan by which a few men enriched themselves, &c. Can a gentleman of Senator Owen's intelligence by any possibility bef lieve such trash as that! Is he not aware that the money panic of Oc tober, 1907, was by no means con fined to the United States The distress in this country was, gone up in something like proportion. A score of years ago a government job was looked upon as a sinecure; it was the goal of more than half the voters in every Congressional district; members of House and Senate spent much of their time trying to land po sitions for their constituents, and the man or woman fortunate enough to be attached to a $1,000 or $1,200 salary was the envy of every one engaged in work requiring a similar amount of brains and energy, but longer hours, outside the executive departments. But all this has been changed. There no wild scramble for the govern ment clerkships and envy no longer exists among those on the outside. Tbe word sinecure has become almost ob solete and "overpaid"' is certainly not a synonym for "government clerk." Any honorable employment, of course, is desirable to a man who finds him self oat of employment, or who ' is forced, for any reason to make a change, and there will probably never be any difficulty in finding men and women to perform the government tasks. een with salaries on the present plane. The Herald believes, however, that a readjustment of salaries in the civil service would be nothing more than simple justice. The emplojes in the government departments certainly earn eery .penny they are paid. If they are not underpaid, they are so near that condition that the nation's self- respect is menaced. In political cam paigns and other occasions we hear much from the orators of more than one political party about the poorly paid toilers for the great corporations. Is it not the duty of those in power to see to it that the danger of a simi lar reproach to the United States gov ernment is removed? Should not the nation lead and set the example to the great organizations of capital in commerce and industry of granting a just, if not generous compensation to its employes? With the Political Procession., in other pursuits, we are confident, re gard the go eminent clerk as a hard working, conscientious, faithful and valuable member of the great army of workers that are the backbone of the real city, and would join in a demand upon Congress for a salary readjust ment While justice is the first con sideration, it is a fact that more pay for the clerks means more business for Washington. The semi-monthly pay envelope, instead o'f going for bare necessities alone, ought, as a simple right, to permit of some luxuries. Economy is still the "watchword on Capitol Hill, we know, but where economy conflicts with justice it should not be hard for members of Congress to choose their ground. Justice in this case has been deferred time after time. It ought to prevail at this session. It is one of the things all Washington ought to demand. nunrtc- in nny fmilrtr lianViwrr orl inrrency system, more acute and pro-1. The PePlc of Washington engaged longed than in other countries, but they were having a very unhappy time of it all over the world, throughout the autumn of 1907. Doesn't Senator Owen know that in almost every civilized country credit had been, for several years prior to 1907, under an exceedingly heavy strain; a stiain so prolonged that some break was bound to occur somewhere I Is he, the Chairman of Vie Srnate Committee on Banking and Currency, not enough of a stu dent to have read the predictions of disaster that were freely made months prior to the panic by many writers on economics abroad and here? Finally, was Senator' Owen himself experienced in banking, so out of touch with the whole situa lion that he failed to realize that the whole banking community was, dating back for months before the panic, doing its utmost to prevent the stringency that was approach' ing, taking every measure in its power to allay apprehension and nvo'd an impending storm? Wp have heard soreheads and demagogues indulge in this loose talk about the panic of 1907 being "engineeied," but it makes us pro foundly melancholy to have a man of Senator Owen's intelligence, char acter, and standing, let himself go like this. The effect upon our own citizens is, of course, very bad, and, "urthermore, we kind of hate to have our leading legislators set them selves up as laughing stocks before all the economists of Europe. There, Senator Owen, now we feel better1 We confess that ever since we read your remarks abou a week ago we have been feeling pretty peevish about them, rather humili ated and sad. So we had to get these honest opinions about your rpeech out of our system. But please don't imagine that our feel ings toward yon are anything but friendly. As head of the Senate Committe on Banking and Currency you have an unexampled opportunity to render your country a great serv ice. We feel certain that you will be both open-minded and patriotic enough to accomplish such a result. Gov. Cox, of Ohio, had a busy day with the corn boys, but he was careful to con nect with the home Democrats in Con Tress and he had little trouble In arrang Ins a few executive sessions with those who believo in him. cr In missing others who resent his part In putting: them In hopelessly Republican districts. The half dozen who were especially fa vored by the Cox domination at Columbus when the redisricting bill was passed came quickly to the governor's grasp of hand and remained near him much of the single day he was In Washington. As the governor was once a Congressional secretary twenty years ago and later served two terms in the House, he needed no guide, and enjoyed a general getting around among old friends from other states. There was general congratulation among his old friends that he has not been bitten by the Presidential bug and Is somber when the matter of a second term as governor Is mentioned. Ohio has not been Inclined to the second term for Democrats, and Harmon was the first to achieve re-elertlon through no fault of his own. Gov. Cox has never gotten over being a newspaper man, and begs his friends not to forget that he still owns two high-class journals In the Big Miami Valley doing well and loyal to the Demo cratic party. The Kentucky Idea Is to overlook noth Ing In politics and hold on to much. Only a few weeks after John Hughes, Harrodsburg, hung up his Presidential commission as collector of Internal reve nue In the Danville district, he gave signs of a yearning for the Congressional honor. Harvey Helm Is the able and ambitious Incumbent, but the Hughes appointment came from the Senatorial dispensary and he Is under no obligations to keep out of the contest unless big Ollle James gives the word to let Helm alone. Other candidates are Intent on giving Helm something to think about, and Hughes may await their open decla rations before turning his collector's office Into a political headquarters. He was in Washington pending his appoint ment and rather liked the looks of things In the Immediate vicinity. Christmas Money. However much we may deprecate the "commercialization" of Christmas out of a holy day of sacred festivity into a time for the exchange of pre' sents in which some would hae us believe there is little or no good will we must all confess that this "com mercialization" has increased the thrift of the people of the United States. .More than ten million dollars, it is estimated has been saved for Christ mas money through Christmas Savings accounts in the banks of the United States. At least half a million will be paid out to holiday savers in Washing ton. These great sums are merely supplementary to what the people have saved without the impetus to thrift and the restraint from improvidence which the voluntary, but inviolate ob ligations of these Christmas savings accounts give. But the Christmas sav ings accounts are good indications of the desire of the American people, so often accused of prodigality, to protect' themselves against the temptations to spend as rapidly as they earn. To a Harrisburg, Pa, man belongs the credit of originating the system of Christmas and club savings. On his own particular system, the most gen erally used, he obtained a patent from which he has obtained a revenue that Tlie conference of New York Repub licans on Friday will bring Into public view several distinguished citizens who have not been conspicuous In the last ear or two. but who were much In print and political promotion prior to the Pro gressive revolution against Taft. Dr. Hill, who was never much of a poli tician, but big enough to be Ambassador to Germany, has given notice that he will take part in the Friday meeting, along with Benjamin F. Tracey. who was Secretary ot the Navy long. long ago, and George W Wickersham. late Attor ney Central. Others not famous as prac tical political) but deferred to In other days for their eminent respectability Nicholas Duller, college president; Will Ism Nelson Cromwell, corporation law er: George R. Sheldon, treasurer of the National Committee; Seth Low and Sam uel Falrchild, president of the Union League Club have also been asked by Chairman Barnes and have promptly Indicated that they will be on hand. Ot course National Chairman Mites, Job Hedges. Henry L. Stlmson, William Loeb, Henry Taft. and Chauncey M. Depew will be there and would hardly have remained away had no Invitation been sent. There is a good deal of the "once was' in the list of notables, us compiled up to date, but many are joung enough to promise much for the reorganized Re publican party, after It gets a new start next Friday afternoon. Congressman George vv . Falrchtld, of the Oneonta district, who rejoices in a safe district, is much encouraged by the prom ise of the Friday conference to set things going In the good old way once more. and he Is planning to clear up his Con gressional business In time to reach the New York meeting and modestly Join in its deliberations. Falrchild not only expects a Republican governor In New York next year, with a full complement of Republican State offi cials at Albany, but predicts a notable In crease in the number of Republican Con gressmen not only from up State, hut from New York City, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. There Is anguish In the Falrchild soul that all of Long Island. Manhattan Is land, and contiguous country near to Peeksklll on the Hudson has but one Re publican In Congress, Calder, of Brook lyn. Coming down on the train through Jersey the Oneonta statesman wept again to think or eight Congressional districts, all within a radius of twenty-five miles from New York, with a population of nearly a million and a half, sending eight Democrats to Congress, besides two Democratic Senators from the same lo cality. Falrchild Is a business man and expert at figures. He had time before reaching Trenton to count, up thirty-one Democrats In Congress from Gotham town and con tiguous territory In Jersey, representing a population of 7,000,000 people, while but one Republican represented the host of Republicans who failed to vote the right way a year ago, and are sorry for It since. The emlnentvCltlzen of Oneonta -might have done some more figuring and com paring before the trat- reached Phila delphia, He could have taken the great area of Ohio and Michigan, with a total population of 7,600.000, Just about that of the thirty-one Congressional districts In an area of twenty-flve square miles In New York City and New Jersey. H6 could have counted up thirty-three mem bers of Congress from the two great states, as against a nearly equal num ber from the territory no larger than three or four counties In Michigan or Ohio. Alas! that the Falrchild soul was not cheered by the Republican representation rrom Ohio with only three RepuMIcans out of twenty-two In the Housv The showing Is better In Michigan, with only twn T)mrwrAK snri th Nw Ynrle statesman has had assurance since com ing to Washington that Ohio wlU do bet ter another year. "Harry Lane, Democrat of Oregon, Term expires March 3, 1919." Such Is the biographical contribution of the new Oregon Senator to the latest Congres sional directory. While there Is a slight Inclination to the freakish In such brevity, the new Senator may be striking an average as the biography of Lafferty, a House member from the same State, takes up mos; ot a page. Lane was not so brief in his first contribution, which took up sir lines and carefully Incor porated the Information that he had graduated In medlcin-and had served four years as head of the Oregon State Insane Asylum. Possibly the distinguish ed alienist thought best to eliminate all references to past performances of a professional character. Kven Lafferty has cut down his life story about two Inches, but it still looms up the longest in the book. Welles, ot Ohio, who Is promised some diversion as a possible candidate for gov ernor next year, dropped out a few lines of his original contribution. Woods, of Iowa, now chairman of the Republican Congressional Committee, had a very modest paragraph in the first edition, but has cut It down one-half In the latest volume. Wlngo. ot Arkansas, has a single line In December, while In April he put up a considerable story of past performances In politics and public anairs Derore reach ing Congrersional honors. Gorman, of Illinois, also did some cut ting down, following the example of Smith and Hamilton, the Michigan states men who started the fashion of a single line. Statesmen, Real aad Near. By

But once In a long time he meets up with somebody that he can't forgive worth a cent. Some years ago Johnson was a candi date for the Democratic nomination for governor of bis State and the nomination that year was equivalent to an election. He would have landed except tor one man who started some campaign lies about him and In the other ways "done him dirt."

Then the man sent emissaries to Johnson with the tidings that he realized he had once served Johnson a mean trick and that ho was mighty sorry he had behaved In such a shameful manner. "Are you quite sure the man really Is sorryr" Inquired Johnson, with a benign smile that seemed to bode no III. "Ob. yes Indeed," replied the man's emissary. "He Is thoroughly sorry. He wants to meet you and apologize." "You think there's no bluff about It and he's positively sorryr' persisted Johnson, talking still more amiably. "No question about It," the envoy as sured him. "Then." said Johnson. "I wish you woud Just say to the man that he Is not half as sorry as I Intend that he will be later on. ' DAILY SHORT STORY POLLY AND THE PANS. William R. Hearst was much pointed out as he came through the Wlllard way. but he did not linger lone, even with New York Democrats, who happened to be In the Immediate vlclnlt The sug gestion of Hearst as a possible candidate for Senator has given shivers to real Democrats, and some apprehension to real Republicans, who feel he may gather up all the odds and ends ot political rartles while posing as a Democrat and simply havo a plurality when tbe votci are counted. Hearst himself Is saying nothing, but his smile continues and he went Into closed door sessions yesterday with some of his ardent admirers from other States than New York. Indicating that while he may not be a Presidential candidate he appreciates the fact that there Is no tell ing what may happen In two years, espe cially If a popular elective Senatorial honor comes along a year ahead. NEW LEGATION CREATED. Paratrnny and Urnsnay to Have Sep arate Ministers from V. S. The House yesterday passed a bill making separate legations of the United States for Paraguay and Uruguay. It Is understood that Daniel vv. Mooney. a State senator In the Ol legislature, who resides at St Marys, In that State, will be appointed to one ot these posts. The passage of this bill, for which all of the Ohio Democrats voted, removes a serious obstacle to the confirmation of Brand Whltlock. of Toledo, who has been nominated as Minister to Belgium. Senator Pomerene acquiesced in the election of Mr. Whltlock only on condi tion that State Senator Mooney. who has been endorsed by the Democratic State organization also should be appointed.

(Written expressly for The Washington Herald.) By E. J. EDWARDS. DO not think that the history of any American who began with nothing and who accumulated by his own energy and thrift a great fortune Is more romantic or Instructive than the story of the career of George Law" Capt Frederick a Wagner made this statement to me recently. He Epoke as oie having some authority. He has been personally familiar with the careers or many ot the successful Americans who began with nothing. He knew tne earliest seneration of the Vanderbllts Intimately. He had vivid recollections of the time when E. 1L. Harrlman worked In a broker's office. He was provost marshal of New York In 186J and did much to quell the mob which for two das had complete possession ot the city. Y2nrr T-auir nim flis snn nf an Trial.

When we read Socialist literature we can't blame some people for saying that education doesn't pay- When children no longer believe In Santa Claus they are no longer satis fied with cheap presents at Christmas. We could whip the Mexicans with baseball bats, but we don't suppose they would fight that way. Why Is It that a man who can hardly see to read can see a silt cklrt six blocks away? In North Carolina, we understand, they pronounce Huerta as If It were spelled Hewreeta. You can't blame the Mexicans for call ing us "gringoes." We caU them "greasers." Hon.

In 1806, and ho' worked as hard as ever a farmer's boy did, partly because he was anxious to help his father. His birthplace was not far from the boyhood home of Leland Stan ford, who made a great and very successful career In California. "Geonru Law was still In his teens when he started out for himself. He had but little schooling, but he made the most ot what he did have. He read a great deal and he was fascinated by the biography of an engineer whose name I have forsotteij which came Into his hands. I suppose that biography rurnisnea tne nr-r inspiration which George Law had to make the most of himself. "He got some menial employment as a laborer when he left home, and out of his cant wages he always managed to save something with whloh to help his father.

He had accumulated a cjhslderable sum. upon which he was relying as financial basis for'ccrtaln contracts hlch he hoped to secure.

COOPER, (CbDrrtzbr. Mil) The luxurious little clubrooms were aglow with a soft rose light from the shaded candles. A hum of voices, much like the buzz of honey bees In a sweet- scented garden, permeated the air. The exclusive guests who had arrived for the dinner numbered but a baker's dozen seven women and six men. Of the. women, six of tnem were -lavishly gowned; perhaps Paquin or Polret or Lucille had created the toilettes. The seventh and odd feminine guest was Polly Prue. and she had not only .de signed her simple little frock, but her own slim fingers had aewn It Of the men. Lord Henry Vane was undoubtedly the, most attractive. Also he was the guest of honor. He had come over from his estate In England to study and, perhaps, to find a mate among the American buds and blossoms. Lord Henry was neither enormously wealthy nor was he poor. He was free to choose a mate as his heart dictated. When the handsome Sybil Carter had planned the dinner at the club In bis honor she had not expected the sudden visit of her cousin, Polly Prue. She had, however, hidden her chagrin with well-bred affection, and Polly had been brought an unwilling guest to the party. The girl from the country was not one whit abashed at finding herself among the twelve aristocrats of the social world. She accepted her entrance Into the foreign atmosphere with calm eyes that held a trifle of amusement In their gray depths. There was an air of expectancy In the room brought about by the acknowledged perfection of the chef. Rlgaud. In all of New York there was probably no cuisine more notable than that ot Rlgaud. Tlie salaries he had been offered for private homes would have satisfied a money leader's avarice, yet the little rotund Frenchman chose to establish his reputa tion In club dining rooms. It was then In the nature of a tragedy when the remaining maid entered from the kitchen to inform the guests that Rlgaud and the other maid had taken that especial moment to elope. Consternation In Its most dire form was then the fate of those thirteen ex pectant guests. Sjbll Carter turned positively ghastly beneath her dainty rouge. "Impossible!" she gasped, and lifting high her frock, stepped Into the deserted kitchen. ' The maid had spoken the truth. Rlgaud i the wonderful chef, had Indeed disap peared. . How Jolly, for him'" laughed Lord Henry, who was more philosophical than the others. "No girl has ever eloped with me."" You have probably never asked one to." Sybil fos'nd voice to say. The glance she cast him revealed much. But the dinner for your guesUT" It was the voice of Polly Prue that sug gested the practical turn. "Can we not manage to cook and serve the dinner?" Six horrified pairs of feminine eyes were turned full upon Polly and six startled but Interested men returned her calm gaze. "Are you mad or merely Joking?" asked Sybil. "Neither." Polly Informed her. "It 1 simply pouring rain and we would all have to go to some less artistic restaurant and wait perhaps longer than we would If we tuck In and get dinner ourselves." "Bully for you!" put in one of the masculine voices. A chorus of feminine voices protested. Inadvertently. Polly had stirred a nest of hornets. A peculiar little smile lurked in the comers of her scarlet' lips and something of defiance as welL It was plaint evident that the set Into which she had been .dragged considered It de grading and altogether' beneath them to soil their manicured finger tips in cull nary art ' "The truth of the matter Is.' Miss Prue," laughed Lord Henry, "that not cne among you can cook a good square meal." , "You are quite right" admitted Sybil as If she were more than proud of her lack. "He Is entirely wrong." Polly retorted, with a smile into Lord Henry's eyes. "I can cook so that even an epicure would demand a second dose." She turned to the Interested men and highly displeased women. "If you will, all stay out of the kitchen and let me have my way I will have dinner on the table In two hours." "Oh, I say'" protested the men. "we cannot allow you" Polly smiled a rmlte that dulled the mockery of her retort "But I am really tpred sitting here trying to make small talk 1ft. which I am not nn whtt Inter ested. 1 will be far happier trying to re deem my sex in Lord Henry's skeptical cjes." she was In the kitchen before an other word reached her ears. And while Folly was tripping about among tlio pots and pans lnceascd In Rigaud's grext apron. Sybil Carter's guests laughed and chatted. Underneath the surface the feeling grew In the hearts of the women that not one of the six men had remained true In his allegi ance to one wom.n. Each had swerved ritddenly toward Polly Prue. From the kitchen there came from time to time a little soft melody. It was Lord Henry who listened snost eagerly for the sound and watched for a sight of the tawny, sun-kissed head that o6se above the white of Rlgaud's apron. She flitted about and the English peer found himself speculating Idly about his estate. should some one with gray eyes and tawny hair be flitting about even as Polly Prue flitted about these club rooms. It was he who was commanded to carry In the great tray with Its odorous roast of beef; It being deemed too heavy for the slight maid. As he lifted the silver tray from Polly's hands he laughed frankly into her eyes. am going to send you roses that must strive In vain to rival the beauties' In jour cheeks. Also. I am going to take you to dinner and the theater for standing In the hot kitchen." He turned and went Into the dining room. Polly Prue felt suddenly giddy. Surely her heart was not going to- give her trouble. Yet it certainly would seem as If the smile In Lord Henry's eyes Intended to linger In her mind. As for the young lord, he experienced his first thrill since first love days when he realized that he was carving the roast that Polly had cooked. The sensation was startling. Toward the end of a most perfectly served dinner It became more than evi dent that If Polly were to remain In the aristocratic circle for more than a fevr days, six masculine hearts would be flung down for her to trample vn. She had proven herself worthy in a hundred little was that homage of the finest was her due. It was a scant three weeks before Lord Henry sailed back to his native land "I could not have lived without you. my own." he said to some one who stood within the circle of his arm as the ship plc-wed her way over a moonlit sea. A tawny head pressed against his shoulder, and. stooping. Lord Henry brushed his lips across Polly's eyes. WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH THINGS? THE OPEN FORUM New Village. N. J., Dec 3.

OITICIAIIY EEPUDIATED. Mrs. Geortre on American SstftraEtsta and Milltantlsm. To the Editor: Your editorial nf De. cember 1 chartres m with maklne- "too large" on assertion and with making an unsupported claim that the - woman suffragists of this country Indorse militancy. At the meeting of the Homo Interest Club of Takoma Park on Satur. day evening. I did assert that as far as l Knew no American suffrage organiza tion. save that of Pennsylvania, has re pudiated the methods of th English militants. I did assert that this failure to officially condemn these methods was a symptom thai the desire for the ballot blinded women to clear Issues of right and wrong. If suffrare onranlzationa other than that of Pennsylvania are, on record as repudiating the methods of English militants, information to that enecrwHl be most welcome to me. Mv anti-suffrage principles rest in a bed rock ot patriotism and an a patriot I fear the presence In our country of any group of individuals, who. in this time of In creasing- lawlessness and turbulence. preach the doctrine that the end Justifies the means. I shall, therefore, welcome the news that any suffrage organization. witn tne single exception of -Pennsylvania, has gone on record on the side ot law and order. This I know: The Orzanlza- tlons ot Women Voters, ot Colorado, of uauiornta, and or Illinois, officially In dorsed Mrs. Panknurst during her recent visit to thiscountry. Your editorial calls attention to the un questioned fact that the enfranchisement ot women in thjs country has thus far Deen accomplished without. acts of vio lence. Yet the telegrams of sympathy which Mrs. Pankhurst read at her first meeting in New York from the president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, from the admirable Miss Jane Addams, from "the enfranchis ed women of Colorado," and from scores of other Individuals and suffrage or ganizations, at least lent color to Mrs. Pankhurst's claim made at that meet ing (and it drew the greatest applause of the evening) that "perhaps4 the rea son you are not militant In America Is Troutdale. Ores;, "Dec. St. Mrs. Clara Larsson. daughter of an Oregon pioneer resident was. elected mayor of this place by five votes. Ddpo. 11L. Drc 3. A giraffe being shipped to winter quarters of a circus stuck its head out of the car and was struck by a switch engine. The animal Is being cared for In an Improvised hospital. Veterinary surgeons say it will live. because we are doing your fighting for you." So the suffragist stands perplexed torn by her sense of loyalty to the woman whose misdirected zeal has advertised "The Cause." and by her belief that the situation in the United States does not demand militancy'. Many suffragists are on record In favor of militancy. Miss Mll- holland said In Philadelphia, "acid throw ing and bomb throwing have their places." Mrs. Brennan. an officer, of the Woman's Political Union. In a signed letter to a New York paper said, 'It the men of the East do not give the woman of the East what the men of the West have given their women, we shall re sort to militancy. Here and there a suffragist such as Mrs. Andrew D. White, publicly deplores the tendency of American suffragists to condone militancy, but organizations of suirragists fall so to do. Even the W. C. T. U. In national convention at Asburv Park, on October SO. 13, recorded that "the Union should not condemn tbe militant methods of the suffragists In England." Perhaps Carrie Nation, the Kansas woman with the municipal vote and her hatchet was the forerunner of Mrs. PanKhurst and her "little fllntv messengers" of Ull and her firebrands or 191Z. Who gave the ovation to Mrs.Pank- nurst at tne Columbia Theater two weeks ago? Not antl-suffragistx. I assure you. At the Takoma meetlnr I dlfl sut- sert that the Congressional headquarters of the National Suffrage Association are In charge of a young woman who has herself been an English, militant If this be "too large" an assertion, make it less, it facts and resolutions warrant it. t for one shall .welcome the correction, for the question is -not one of suirnn' nr oi anu-sunrage. put of the indorsement of lawlessness as acalnst the endeavors after a more stable form of government jagneeu
