FROM NEW YORK. NEW YORK, Dec. 9. The Secretary of the Navy has dispatched one of the most powerful Teasels in the navv i and a swift gunboat to intercept the rebel steamer Nashville on her retnrn trip. The instructions of the officers are to approach tbe British coast aa near as the neutrality laws will permit, and to cruise off the coast until tbey capture tbe steamer. Tbe Nash ville is likely armed, and if tbe United States steamer tall in with her she will certainly be taken. A written bill of attainder on the part of the loyal owners of the Nashville has also gone out in one of the late steamers to be executed in Southampton. Secretary Chase s report, after referring to the recommendations contained in his July report, gives tne manner in which he ob tained loans for various purposes of the Government. The immediate exigencies were provided for by issuing $14,16,034 in C per cent two years Treasury notes, and $12,877,650 in the same notes payable in 00 kdays. Hisj next care was to provide lor disbursements for the war and he adopted the plan to engage the banking institutions of the three commercial cities of the seaboard to advance the amount needed in loans for 3 years 7 8- 10 bonds to be reimbursed from proceeds of similar bonds subscribed for by the people, hoping thus to combine the capital of the banks and the people with the credit of the Government, so as to give efficiency to ad ministrative action and competent support to the public credit, and the result has ful filled the hope. He then rehearses the agree ment entered into between the banks and himself by which the former agreed to take the loans. The history of the first two loans has already been made public The second loan was negotiated with the banks on the 6th of November by which he agreed to issue to them fifty millions 6 per cent bonds at par for the bonds bearing 7 per cent, in terest. This agreement was accompanied with an arrangement for reimbursement and entailed no expense except the preparing and issuing tne bonds. Tnis was also complied with the option to the banks that on and af ter the 1st of January, a fourth advance of fifty millions should be made on the same terms as the first or second if required. In addition to these loans $21,165,220 np to the 30th of November were issued in Treasury bills of fives, tens and twentys, payable on demand, and $3,380,135 remained in the the Treasury. This amount may be regarded as a loan from the people. The aggregate realised from loans in va rious forms is $107,742,588. The revenue receipts have not fulfilled bis expectation. Hesaysan act modify mg toe rates of duties differed from the measure be submitted to Congress, in most of these particulars, es pecially in diminished duties on tea, coffee, aud sugar, and exempting goods in ware- bouse and on shipboard. Tbe difference was disadvantageous to the revenue, which po tential cause ol reduced receipts, may be found in the changed circumstances of the countty proving unfavorable to foreign com merce. The circumstances compel him to reduce his estimates for 1861 from the rev enue from $57,000,000 to $32,198,602; The estimates from receipts from lands and miscellaneous sources be reduces from $3, 000,000 to $2,340,062. Tbe only other eourcea of revenue is a direct tax authorised by Congress, which, if increased to the limit proposed by the Secretary and assumed by States, the further sum of twenty millions may be expected. The aggregate of revenue may be thus estimated at $54,552,660 which is $25,447,334 less than the estimate of July. 1 be Secretary states the estimates for July were bssed on the raising of 250,000 volun teers and an increase of the ra-jular army by 11 regiments, tot ater that report bad been closed Congress authorised the acceptance by tne resident ot ooo,ooo men, besides addi tional companies and officers. This lartre in crease has and must necessarily augment the expenditures far beyond the liqtft indicated uy me original tsiimsifs, wuicu Will De 8UU further extended by the increase ot the navv. and additional approprmtioag are asked for. Of these additional appropriations $47,935,- atiu were aumonieo oy acts ot last session, and $143,130,927 are now asked for, making an aggregate, including $22,787,033 for indefi nite appropriatione, of $213,804,427. To provide th large sums retrenchment and reform are indispensable. Contracts should. be subjected to. strict supervision, and con tractors rigorous rwp&mibUity. All unne cessary C faces should be abolished, and sala ries and pay materially reduced. W bile thus recommending retrenchment he feels himself constrained to renew sug gestions heretofore submitted by him, that property ot rebels should be made to pay in part, at least, the cost of rebellion. Proper ty of great value in loyal States is held by proprietors virtually engaged in a guilty at tempt to break np the Union, which is iust- jy forfeited to the people, which should be subjected to sequestration or confiscation and the proceeds applied to the satisfaction of claims arising fom the wrr. Property of rebels in rebel States Bhould be treated in the same nanner. Rights to services under State laws must of necessity form an ex ception to any rule of confiscation. Per sons held by rebels nnder such laws to ser vice as Slav may, hower, be Justly liberated from tbeir constraint and made more valu able m various employments through volun tary and compensated service than if con fiscated as subjects of property. The Secretary says that the moet sacred duty of the American people now is the con centration of all their energies to secure the re-establishment of the Union, and sound policy would seem to suggest no extension of foreign trade, but more absolute reliance on American labor, American skill, and on American soil. He recommends the duties on tea. coffee and sugar be increased, to 2 cents per pound on brown, 3 cents on clarified, 20 cents on green tea, 5 cents on coffee, and that no other alteration of tariff be made unless farther experience shall demonstrate the necessity. He deems it necessary to increase the direct fax so as to produce from loyal States a revenue of at least twenty millions, and indicate such duties on stills, distilled liquors, tobacco, bank notes, carriages, conveyances iOt pro perty, and other like property as will pro duce an equal additional sum. Tbe income tax will probably produce $10,000,000 mare, making an aggregate of fifty millions. Tbe Secretary is aware that the sum is large, but seeing no pobabilitr of the revenue I ry of all our our let ter the bad let but the the but is in of T. by SJK S2 mVf from a plain sUtsment of the actual neses- sities ot tbe situation. T wo-6 ftbs of one per cent, on real and personal property of loyal Blates will produce $44,000,000, the pro- poeea locome aaaing iu,uuj,o(f". Tbe Secretary lecommeads a plan for national circulation of notes, tbe features of wbicb axe a circulation ot notes bearing common impression and authenticated I common authority.

He states it is earn' eatly hoped, not without sufficient grounds, idhi tne present war o Drouum to an auspi eions termination before midsummer, and that in that event the provision ot revenue by taxation recommended will saince for ail financial exigencies without additional loans, and enable the Government at once to begin a reduction of the existing debt, if the war continues to July 1st, 1862, the public uebtwill be 517,322,802; it tiU July 1st, 1863, it will be, in round numbers, 900 000,000. The prohibition of trade with the rebel States has been fully enforced. Regulations bs re been established by which rice, cotton and other PPTt7 in the insurrectionary uisuicis uccupieu Dj our troops win De con- nscated and sent by sea to New York. All sales will be tor account of Government and the proceeds paid into the National Treasury. A3 a general rule commerce should follow the flag, and when the authority of the union is fully restored in the States, ports should be opened without restriction and all commerce freely permitted. 4Tbe Secretary closes by savine it bas been his endeavor to infuse into his department tbe greatest possiule activity and vieor and hopes that a continued endeavor with larger experience will make it what it ought to be. 

CONGRESSIONAL. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. SENATE. A number oi petitions were presented aud referenced to appropriate committees. Sev eral on the emancipation of slaves of rebels were presented and referred to Committee on Judiciory. Mr. Sumner presented a resolution that all memorials and papers on the files of the Senatejreloting to the recognition of Siberia and Hayti, be taken from the files and re ferred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Agreed to. Mr. Clark offered a resolution reouestinir the Marshal of the District to inform the Senate by what authority he keeps slaves of tne District in jail. He said he had visited tbe jail and found a number of slaves of the District confined for no reason onlv because tbeir masters or mistresses sent them there because they were refractory. air. nail s resolution directing tbe judicia committee to inquire into the exoedieocT abolishing the present Supreme Court and establishing another was taken up. He said the present Supreme Court had failed. betieved if the rebels now in arms should succeed the Supreme Court would decide that the saldiers now in Virginia were tres passers and riotors. Mr. Collamer moved as a substitute, that portions ot the President's Message rela ting to the judiciary be referred to the judi ciary committee. Mr. Collamer' s amendment was agreed to the resolution as amended was adopied. On motion of Mr. Chandler the resolution inquiring into the causes of the disasters to army at Bull Run and Balls' Bluff, was taken up. Tbe question was on the substi tute offered by Mr. Grimes, that a committee investigate the cause of all the disasters that have happened to the Union forces. Mr. Chandler Buid officers of the army were not liable to impeachment, bnt one of own number has fallen (Baker), and no body is to blame. He thought the facts ought to be known. He wanted the truth known regarding distuters in Missouri reler red to by the Senator from Kansas. If Gen. Fremont is to blame let it be known, but it in God's name let him be justified, and the country know it. Mr. Foster thought it best not to Investi gate the subject now unjer the present cir cumstances. He thought Congress had bet aot ao it. it military omcera manasred army badly, Congress weald only make a matter worse by interfering. He would tbe military alone in time of war. An inquiry of this kind would only call men away from higher duties. At the proper proper time Congress might make tie in quiry. 41 r. Sherman believed an investigation would he beneficial, especially a general in quiry into the whole conduct of the war, said he would record his solemn convic tion that before the war ceaBed slavery would almost, it not entirely, cease to exist, the war should be carried on without reference to the subject of slavery to preserve a free country for free men. If he could infuse the spirit pi (te people into all .Departments of the Government the war would soon end. Mr. Wilson was glad tbe resolution would take a wijejtield. He thought it was time tbe proclamations of officers should cease aud Government have the sole settled policy. We must remember that we had not tbe men of large military experience; great mis taHea bad been made aod were likely to be made, but he wanted it understood that the people expected no mistakes would be made, that every man will give all he has and to the country. Mr. Latham asked for tbe yeas and nays. Tht resolution was agreed to. Teas 33, nays 3 Messrs. CarlUe, Latham and Rice. Absent Bright, Collamer, Foote, Thompson, Milley aad Wilson. Adjourned.
