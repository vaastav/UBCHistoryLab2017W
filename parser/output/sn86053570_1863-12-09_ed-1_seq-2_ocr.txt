For IhCSt.and especially for the Improved condition of our ntllODBI euaira, I'ur rvurnru iuu jumuuuuw gratitude to Qol Is due . We remain In ptare and friendship with for In powers. The efforts of disloyal cltlsena of the United States to Involve us In foreign wars, to aid an Inexcusable Insurrection, have bcenunavelllng. Her Britannic Majrstv's government, at was Jnatlr expected, hare exercised their authority to prere nt the departure of new hostile expedi tion from Brltlih porta. The Emperor of Frame h, by a like proceeding, promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest. Questions of great Intricacy and Importance have arlaen out of the blockade, and other belligerent ope rations, between the government and several of the maritime power, but thevhave been discussed, and, a far a wa poislble, accom modated In a spirit of frankness, Justlcr, and mutual good will. It I especially gratifying that our prize courts, by the Impartiality of their adjudication, bare commanded the res pect and confidence of maritime power. The snppllmental treat v between the Tutted States andOrcat Britain for the suppression of ine Ainran siaveiraae, maaeon me ltin aav of February last, has been duly ratified, and carried Into execution. It Is believed that, so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that Inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end. I shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a convention for ihe adjustment of possessory claims in natnngton Territory, arising out or the treaty or the 13th Jnnc , 1&46, between the United States and Great Britain, and which hare bcou the source of some dls quiet among the citizens of that now rapidly Improving part of the country. A novel aod Important question. Involving the extent of the maritime Jurisdiction of Spain In the waters which surround the Island of Cuba, baa been debated without reaching an agreement, and It is proposed. In an amicable apim, in reier it in me arbitrament or a friend ly Power. A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate. I have thought It proper, subject to the ap proval of the Senate, to concur with the in terested commercial powers In an arrangement for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues uton the principles which have been heretofore adopted In regard to the Imposts upon navlga- i inn id me waters oi uenmaric. The onff-pen dinar controversy between this government and that of Chill, touching the citnreai ouana, in rem, ny unman omcers, of a large amount of treasure belonging to cit izens of the United Slstrs, has been brought to a close by the award of hi Majesty the king of me Belgians, townose arbitration toe question was referred by the parties. The subject ws thoroughly and pstlentlv examinee bT that Justly respected magistrate, and although ihe snm awaracQ 10 me ciaimania may not care been as Isrge as they expected, there is no rea son to dlMrust toe wisdom of his Msjest de elflon. Thst decision was promptly compiled with by Chill, when Intelligence in regard lo it reached that conntiy. The Joint commission, under the art of the last session, for carrying Into effect the con ventlon with Fern on the subject of claims, hss been organized at Lima, and Is engaged In the business Intrusted to It. Difficulties concerning inter.oceaulc transit through Mearaugua are In course of amicable adjustment.

The proper offlcura of the Treasury have deemed themselves required, by the law ofthe unueu oiaiM upon uie euoject, to demand a tax upon the Incomes ot foreign consnls In this country. While such a demand rosy not, tn strictness, he In derogation of public Law, or perhaps of any existing treaty between the United fetatea and a foreign country, the expe diency of so far modifying the art as lo exempt from lax the Income of auch consuls as are not citizens ofthe United States, derived from Ihe laioiumrou m toeir oiuce, or iroin property not situated In tho United tttate, Is submitted to your serlon consideration. I make this suggestion tipoo the ground that a tomlty which ought to be reciprocated exemtts our consuls, In all other countries, from taxation to the extent thus indicated. The Unite, I States, I think, ought not to be cxeeptlonably illiberal to International trade and commerce. The operations of the treasury during the last year hare been successful!) conducted.

Tho school Is now more full and complete than at any former ficrlod, nd In every respect entitled in the avorable consideration of Congress. During th past fiscal year the financial con dition of the Post Office Department has been one of Increasing prosperity, and lam grati fied In being able to state that the actual postal rcrentio'haa nearly equal led the entire expendi ture tbe latter amounting to $11,314,30(1 M, and the former to 11.103,789 fit, leaving a de ficiency of lmt 1150.417 25. In 1814t the year Immediately preceding the rebellion, the defi ciency amonnted to 5,OV1,?05 40, tbe postal rtcelpts of that var1ing 3,$43,7?9 19 less thau those of lftt. The decrease since 1K In the annual amount of transportation has been only about 3ft per cent , but the annual expenditure on account ol the same has been reduced W per cent. It Is manlft( tnerefore, that tbe post Offlc Department maj he. ccme seli-sustalnlngln a tew J ears, even with the restoration ol th wtxlesrvlee. The International eonlerence of postal delegates from the principal couulrlea of Kurope and Amrr lea, which wa called at the suggestion or th Pos. master General, met at Paris oa th 11 th of May last, ard oon eluded Its deliberation on the Bih of June. Ihe principles established by the confer ence as best adapted to facilitate i oatal tntcrcoursa between nations, and aa the basla of future posttl conventions, Inaugurate a general system of uni form international charges, at reduced rt es of pottage, and eannot fall to produce beneficial re sults 1 refer oit to th report of the eoretarj of the Interior, which la herewith laid befnre )ou, for useful an 1 varied Information in relation tn the public lands, Indian aflalrs, patents, pension, and other matters ol publte concern pertaining; to his department. The qunu tit y or land disposed of during the last and the first quarter of the present fiscal years was three million eight hnndrcd and for-tj-one thousand flvehnndrcd and forty nine acres, of which one hundred and sixty-one thousand nine hundred and eleven acres wero sold for cash, one million four hundred and fifty-six thousand five hundred aud fourteen acres were taken up under tho homestead law, and the residue disposed of vndcr laws grant ing lands for military bounties, for railroad, and other pnrpoes. It alao appear that the sale of the public lands Is largely on the In crease. It has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen that tho people of the United States had a higher and more enduring Interest In tbe early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public land than In the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sate of them. This opinion haa had a con trolling Influence In shaping legislation upon the subject of our national domain. i may cite, as evidence or this, the liberal measure adopted In reference to actual sit- tiers tbe grant to the Bute of the overflowed lands within their limits In order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation; the grants to railway companies of alternate sec tions of land upon the contemplated lines of their roads which, when completed, will so largely multiply tne lacuiiiee tor reaching our distant possessions. This policy has received Its most signal and beneficent Illustration tn the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual settlers. Since the first day of January last the before mentioned qnantity of one million four hun dred and flrty-slx thousand five hundred and fourteen acres of land have been tuken up un der Its provisions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying evidence of Increas ing settlement upon the public lands, notwith standing the great struggle In which the ener gies of the nation have been engaged, and which haa required so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their accustomed pursuits. I cordially concnr In Ihe recommendation of the becretary ofthe Interior. sneiHstinff a mo di ilea tlon of the act in favor of those minur d In the military and naval service ofthe I nlted Slate. I doubt not that Congress will cheer fully adopt such measure a will, wlthont escnilally rhangingthegeneralfeatiirei ofthe sv,tem, secure, to the greatest practicable ex tent.

Thoa we have the new reckon ing. The crista which threatened to divide the friends of the. Union Is past. Looking now to tho present and future and with reference-to a resumption of the national authority within the State wherein that au thority ha been suspended, I have thought fit tolaaoea proclamation, a copy of which il herewith transmitted. On examination of this proclamation It will appear, as Is believed, that that nothing Is attempted beyond what lsam ply Justified by the Constitution. True, the form of an oth Is given, but so man It coerced to take It. The man Is only promised -a par don In case he voluntirlly take the oath. The Constitution nnthnrlera the Riccutlvo to STant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute dis cretion and this Incladewtho power tn 'grant on terras, as is Kilty estahllnhedbjr Judicial and other authorities. v ills also pronVrcd that I', In any 01 tne states named, a State nirnmnt shall be.

An attempt to guaranty and protect a re vived Slate government, constructed In whole or In preponderating part, from tlie very cle ment against whose hostility and violence ft Is to bo proiect&l. Is simply absurd. There must be a teat by which to separate the opposing tlenicnts, so as to build only from ilia oand and that test Is a suillciontly liberal one, which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness. But If it be proper to require, as a test of ad mission to the political body, an oath of alle giance to tho Constitution of the United State nod to the Union under It, whyalsotothelawt aud proclamations In regard to slavery? Those laws and proclamation were enacted and put forth for tho purpose of aiding In the suppres sion of tho rebellion. To give them their full est effect, there had to he a pledge for their maintenance. In my judgment they have aid ed, and wilt further aid, tho cause for which therwere Intended To now abandon 'them would lie not ouly to relinquish a lever of power, tmi wool, e 10 nearrnci nuu aa as tounding breach of faith. 1 may erin at this point, tnai wmi 1 remain ia mv nrrsent nmltinn I ahail not atteniiit to retract or modify the emancipation Troclama Ion t nor shall I return to slavery any person who Is lee oy ine terms OI inai proclamation, vr pyanyui lit Cacti nf Contttn Pur tl ete and ther reason It Is thought tevtthat snpport of these measures shall be Included lathe oath) and 11 Is believed the Pxecutlremaylsufunv tUlm It In tetnrn for par don ant restoration or forfeited rights, wrdeb he haa clear constitutional power to withhold alto gether, or grant upm tho terms white hebll ueriu Hiseni laruirpuiiriiiirir.i ihiiuui,i ol rril iIia H.ttnn nartnf the oatli la sub ject to tie roodf)liig and abrogating powerpof leglslallna and supreme Judicial declsloo The proposed ncquliaetnce of tut national a(ccutlve In am reasonable temporary State aryengement for iho freed people Is midewlth the view of poaslblv modifying tho confusion nnd destitution which must, at best, 'attend till tlaaxiab) a total reoJullon of labor through out whole Stale.
