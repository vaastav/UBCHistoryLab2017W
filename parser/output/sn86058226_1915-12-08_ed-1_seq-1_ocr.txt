We must be ready. to meet the crisis or we will cease to exist or will be a subject nation," said William Dudley Foulke at a meeting in the Commer cial club rooms last night. I have never felt so strong for anything since the Civil war, and we must be pre pared to meet the crisis when it comes." As a result of the sentiment ex pressed by Mr. Foulke, Paul Corn stock, Dr. L. F. Ross and others, a special committee was appointed to draft a constitution and by-laws for the formation of a defense league in this city. Resolutions were passed cqmmend ing the president on the position he has taken in recommending increases cf the army and navy to congress and ROF.

ENGINEER DRAWS THREE PLANS FOR NEW MAIN STREET BRIDGE Three sets of Main street bridge plans are being prepared by County Bridge Engineer Mueller to be pre sented to the county commissioners at Dne of the meetings early next year Mr. Mueller said today that he had other information concerning the pro posed bridge which would be placed before the commissioners within a few weeks which will aid in determining what action should be taken In build ing a new bridge. All" three plans are for concrete structures. The details, however, have ict beon worked out by the engineer is they liave only been drawn for the purpose of making a study of the various types in' relation to the loca tion. The test holes, for which money has been appropriated by the county council, will be made within the next t.vo weeks, Mr. Mueller said. G. 0. P. LEADER j CONFERS WITH PRES. WILSON WASHINGTON. Dec. 8 President Wilson conferred today with Sen. Gal linger, Republican leader in the sen ate on the administrations prepared ness program. The result of the con ference was: President Wilson will not sanction a Democratic caucus in either the sen ate or house to cram the necessary legislation through. A majority of the Republicans of the senate favor a sane and not extreme military and naval program. A majority of the Republicans in the senate will support the plan of the president and secretaries of war and navy as outlined by the president in his address to congress yesterday, pro viding the Democratic leaders in the house and senate do not attempt to make the program a party affair. Republicans of the senate do not ap prove of all the suggestions of the president for raising the revenue to meet the coming deficiency in the treasury and to meet the expenses of inaugurating the military or naval pro gram The foregoing is the substance of Senator Gallinger's remarks after emerging from the conference with the president. 

LEAVES CALIFORNIA Mr3. M. F. Johnston, who has been acting as senior docent at the San Francisco exposition, will arrive home Saturday, according to word received today. She left California Monday. asking the Indiana senators and con gressmen to support any movement in stituted in congress toward securing a larger and more efficient fighting force. Dr. Ross Presides. Dr. L. F. Ross, who was named chairman of the meeting, was instruct ed to appoint a committee of five men to discuss the advisability of joining either the National Security league or the American Defense league. The question Of forming an independent organization unallied with any of the larger defense organiza tions,, will also be discussed. The personnel of the committee has not been named by Dr. Ross. A meeting will be called next week for the pur pose of organization. Mr. Foulke quoted from one of the Continued on Page Fourteen. 

PROTESTS will not be any person in the United States unwilling to meet the emer gency. I do not see what the foreign countries would do with an army when they got it here. The nations of the past have gone to destruction even though prepared for war." "I am not in favor of a larger army or navy unless we can have the largest in the world. Both German and Eng land want to own the earth and some nation ought to stand on the side of righteousness' and go down If it must. WbatOa Jaejroaay.'sbifJeetjOfliwULu is : bottled up and . powerless. . That could happen to any fleet the United States could have?" One of the plans proposed by the engineer is for a bridge with a large arch across the river channel and a smaller arch across the C. & O. switch tracks; the second plan is for a bridge with an arch across the river channel and several smaller arches leading to thj east abuttrient; the third is for a bridge on a level ex tending to a point between Second and Third streets. This last plan is believed to be im practical for the reason that the C. & O. railroad company has refused to vacate the right of way across Main street thereby necessitating a grade crossing in event a bridge is built on a level with the west end. The further question of the legality of a county appropriation for this length bridge will probably block this plan. COMMITTEES NAMED FOR COUNTY SESSION OF PYTHIAN LODGES Two committees, each with three members, representing Coeur de Lion and Triumph lodges, Knights of Pyth ias, have been appointed and will meet with the committee of three to be ap pointed by Iola lodge on Thursday, to consider plans for the county-wide cel ebration of the Knights of Pythias of Wayne county, which will be held one day during the week of February 14. The Coeur de Lion committee is composed of Jacob Bayer, Charles Ly ons and George Herbst, and the Tri umph committee is composed of Clar ence Mote, Gus Schroeder and Walter Mock. These committees will attend the meeting of Iola lodge Thursday night and discuss the suggestion made by Grand Chancellor Remy of Indian apolis during his last visit in Rich mond. Harry Wade, past grand keeper of records and seal, probably will be the speaker at the February meeting. First rank work was conducted last night by Coeur de Lion lodge for Mr. Overman. Approximately one hundred members were present. Second rank work will be held next Tue sday night. PROF. BINFORO TO ATTEND SCIENCE ASSOCIATION Professor Raymond Binford, head of the department of zoology, has been appointed a . delegate from Earlham collega to the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advance ment of Science which is to be held at Columbus, Ohio, on December 27 to January 1. WHAT "DEFENSE" ADVOCATES THINK OF WILSON'S IDEAS Prof.. David W. Dennis I have not read the president's message in detail, but I am opposed to an increse in the navy. No matter' how large a navy we have it can be defeated by a Eu ropean power or a combination of Eu ropean powers, . which undoubtedly would oppose us. Paul Comstock President Wilson's recommendations do not meet the con ditions which are presenting them selves. His method would result in a slow process, and something ought to be done immediately. Three years is too long a time to secure the additional army and navy forces the recommend ations callvfor. Dr. L. F. Ross Any step toward greater preparedness is a step in the right direction. I have not read the message in detail. William Bockhoff Any person who has traveled through Europe is im pressed with the fact that the United States should prepare for self-defense. Wilson's recommendations are along the right line, although I do not be lieve he has gone far enough. William Dudley Foulke President Wilson's recommendations to congress are good, as far as they go. It is a step in the right direction, but he was too slow in taking the step. Ten years ago the navy of the United States ranked second in the world, now it ranks a bare fourth. The ap propriations recommended by the president, however, are perhaps as much as the country can stand at the present. The people as a whole are not aware of the precarious position of this country, and as they gradually see this position, it will be possible to do greater things in the way of pre paredness. 

ELECTRIC PLANT ADVERTISES FOR $30,000 TURBINE Board Says New Unit Need ed to Handle Increased Business Even If City Ab sorbs L., H. and P. The board of public works today de cided to advertise for bids for a 2,000-kilowat turbin for the municipal electric plant. The approximate cost of .the new unit, which will have a third more capacity than the two units now carry the city plant's load, will be $30,000. Two obsolete units, no longer used, can be sold, however, and the amount received applied to the purchase price of the new unit. An accident at the plant last night cut off the city service for some time. Had this happened during the day when the plant carries its heaviest load, power users would have been greatly inconvenienced. In conse quence the board decided today that the addition of a new unit to the plant is essential so that the load could al ways be carried even if two or three active units happened to be down at the same time. Reaches Capacity Limit. "Another unit for the city plant is needed now even if the city should take over the electric plant of the Light, Heat and Power company," Su perintendent Kleinknecht said. "At the city plant there are now operated two units, one an engine operated generator with a rated capacity of 800 k. w., the other an engine operated generator with a rated capacity of 400 k. w. These two units have pulled, however, as high as 1,600 k. w., and the daily peak load averages between 1,400 and 1,500 k. w. It can be seen that the plant has now reached its capacity limit, and the continued in crease of business requires an addi tional unit. We have two obsolete units, a turbin, with a rated capacity of 500 k. w and a 300 k. w. Al free engine." The L. H. and P. electric plant has three units, two obsolete. The ser viceable unit, installed this year, is a turbin with a rated capacity of 1,000 k. w. Kleinknecht says that in the event this plant is merged with the city plant there would still be needed a new 2,000 k. w. turbin, because the L. H. and P. turbin would only be enough to handle the business that plant now enjoys, and which would be taken over by the city. "In the last two years the city plant's business has increased 35 per cent, and we now have between 75 and 80 per cent of the business in the city, and our business still continues to in crease at the same rate it has main tained during the last two years," said Kleinknecht.

Rome dispatches stating that the American oil steamer, Communipaw, has been sunk by a sub marine in the Mediterranean, were flatly contradicted this afternoon by reports that the vessel had reached an Egyptian port. At 1:49 p. m. the Cen tral News Agency gave out the follow ing: "We are officially informed that the Communipaw has arrived at Alexan dria." STANDARD OIL NOTIFIED. NEW YORK, Dec. 8. The Standard Oil company today received a dispatch from its representative at Cairo, stat ing that the steamer Communipaw ar rived at Alexandria on Sunday.. Pre vious to the arrival of the dispatch from Cairo the Standard Oil officials has accented with reserve the Rome advices that the vessel had been sunk. The Cairo message strengthend their belief that the vessel had not been sunk. WILSON ORDERS PROBE. . WASHINGTON. Dec. 8. Announce ment was made at the white house to day that President Wilson has ordered an immediately and thorough Inquiry into the attacks on the American steamed PettblfteV a 'submarine fly ing the Austrian flag. It had been planned to include the reported attack on the Communipaw in the investiga tion until it was learned that that ves sel is safe.

FARMER RAISES CORN'S WEIGHT: GETS SI 5 FINE Jarvls Mullen, a farmer living four and a half miles northeast of Rich mond, off the New Paris road, pleaded guilty this morning to a charge of fraudulently representing the weight of a quantity of corn he sold to Ed Eadler, who resides on the Commons road. He was fined $15 and costs. At first Mullen entered a plea of not guilty, through his attorney, Frank Strayer, but later withdrew this plea. The case was reported to Prosecutor Reller bv Insnector of Weights and j Measures McKinley. It was charged by the prosecutor that Mullen weighed a wagonload of corn on the scales at the Reid Hard ware store and was presented with a weigh bill showing the weight, includ ing the wagon, totaled 2,300 pounds. Mullen, the prosecutor said, asked the company employe to certify that the wagon's weight was 690 pounds. This request was refused. He wax told that the wagon could be weighed after the corn had been unloaded. Then, it was stated, Mullen went into a saloon and raised the figures on the weigh bill from 2,300 to 2,670, setting forth on the bill that the wagon's weight was 690 pounds. Mullen then agreed to sell the corn at 57 cents a bushel to Eadler, who accepted the raised figures on the weigh bill as correct, paying for 1,980 pounds of corn when, in reality he se cured only 1,610 pounds. It was later ascertained that the real weight of the corn was 830 pounds. The carbon copy of the weigh bill given to Mullen at the hardware store showed that Mul len had tampered with the figures on the copy he received. It was figured out that Eadler overpaid Mullen $1.55. ESTATE IS DIVIDED The estate of the late William Schroer, valued at $10,000, will be dis tributed among fifteen relatives, is the will, which was entered for probate in circuit court today, is approved by the court.

Their four children will receive $700 each and the rest will be distributed among the nephews and nieces of Mr. Schroer. The Dickinson Trust company was ap pointed executor of the will. BUS RAMS CITY CAR; OTTE ESCAPES INJURY Harry Otte, driving the big auto hack running between here and Ox ford, had a collision this morning with a trolley car at Eighth and North D streets, and as a result the service be tween the two towns will be crippled for a few days. No one was injured. The Oxford hack was going west on D street and the trolley north on Eighth. Both were traveling at a good rate of speed and it was impossible for either the motorman or chauffeur to avert the collision. The auto truck hit the front end of the car and there was an awful crash. People who saw the accident expected to find that Otte was either killed or severely injured but he did not receive a scratch. He expects to resume operations not later than Friday with a new truck. No damage was done to the trolley car. WILSON BACKED IN RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED HERE Thirty-two of Richmond's Citizens Ask Congressman to Support Plans for More Adequate Defense.

FINANCES OF U. S. STRONG says raoo in REPORT OtJ NATION'S TREASURY WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. "The fi nancial situation of this country has never been so strong and so favorable as now," says Secretary of the Treas urer William G. McAdoo in his annual report. )ur financial resources are the greatest in our history and our banking system, through the creation and operation of the federal reserve system, is now the ctrongest in the world." The secretary asserts that the finan cial condition of the treasury is so strong that there will be a balance in the general fund on June 30, 1916, of $32,644,605. Should the war tax, which expires Dec. 31, 1915. be re-enacted and should the one cent a pound duty on sugar, which, under present law will not be collected after May 1, 1916, be continued, the net balance in the general fund on June 30, 1916, will stand at $88,644,C05. Should the $25,000,000 expenditure to be made on the Panama Canal be financed by the sale of bonds as provided by law, the net balance of June 30, 1916, would be $76,644,606, according to the secretary Shows Total Receipts. A recapitulation of the finances shows total ordinary receipts of the treasury for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1915, of $697,910,827 and total ordinary disbursements of $731,399,759. giving a deficiency for the year of $33,488,931. This is merely a defic iency for the year and does not repre sent the treasury as behind that much, for it has not yet used up what it com menced the year with. The secretary estimates that total appropriations for the government for the fiscal year ended June 30. 1917, should be $908,765,929, an Increase

Mr. McAdoo tells the congress. In view of this attitude of the secre tary and the general feeling among ad ministration leaders that retention of the war tax and the sugar duty is In evitable, It is believed here that the government will not be deprived of these sources of revenue, and this be ing the case, Mr. McAdoo says, an ex penditure of $93,800,000 on the pre paredness program will roll up a de ficiency of $50,806,394 by June 30. 1917. the end of the 1917 fiscal year. To meet this deficiency. Mr. McAdoo would Increase the Internal revenue. He figures that the total increase In revenues needed Is $112,80694. pro vided $25,000,000 worth of Panama Canal bonds are not sold. If the Issue should be made, that much would be subtracted from the amount of ad ditional revenue required. Mr. McAdoo's suggestions for rais ing this additional revenue are to: Increase the corporation and person al income taxes by providing higher rates and, In the case of the personal income tax. reducing the $3,000 ex emption for single persons and $4,000 exemption for married folk to $2,000 and $3,000 respectively. Increase the taxes on gasolene, crude and refined oils, horsepower of automobiles and other Internal com bustion engines and "various other things where collection could be made at the source." Mr. McAdoo also says that, following the European war. a flood of imports may be 'expected which will Increase customs duties.
