( lannon I ncle Joe) was re-elected speaker of the house. John Sharp Williams, leader of the Democratic side, was slated for the speakership by the Democrats. The president's message is the longesl on record. No mention of statehood is nade: ii recom mends that campaign expenses of presidential candidates be met by an appropriation from the national treasury : t hat cor porations be prohibited from con tributing toward campaign ex penses; that railroads be grant ed more liberal interstate priv ileges; that corporation laws be modified. In recommending 1 hat t he use of I he w ril of in juncl ion be limited, and in re indorsing the proposed law of employer's liability to workmen, and the extension of the present eight-hour law, organized labor has won a signal victory over corporate opposition. The message, in condensed form, is as follows : Washington, Dec. 3. President Roosevelt's annual message to e. ingress is a voluminous document of nearly 30.000 words, by far the longest mes sage he has ever submitted to congress. The opening subject of the message Is the financial condition of the country, and for which the president lays much of the blame upon unscrupulous stock speculators, and says: "In any large body of men. however, there are certain to be some who are dishonest, and if the conditions art such that these men prosper or com mit their misdeeds with impunity, their example Is a very evil thing for the community. Where these men are busi ness men of great sagacity anil of tem perament both unscrupulous and reck less, and where the conditions are such that they act without supervision or control and at first without effective check from public opinion, they delude many Innocent people into making in vestments or embarking in kinds of business that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these successful 1 ly dishonest men are discovered, suf fering comes not only upon them, but upon the innocent men whom they have misled It la a painful awakening, whenever it occurs; and, naturally, when it does occur those who suffer are apt to forge! that the longer it was deferred the mote painful it would be. i In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so i far as possible to minimize the dis tress of those who have been misled by the guiltv. Yet it is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ultimate causes of the suf fering, and. as a means to this end. where possible to punish those re sponsible for them. There mav be hon est differences of opinion as to many governmental policies; but surely there can be no such differences as to the iiecu ui umiiu-iim& i.t.i ... war against successful dishonesty." cd of unflinching perseverance in the He quotes at length from his mes sage of last year in which he mlvo- .... tul fn.it ar; 1 Piintrnl of nAMtAM tlfltlS . interstate business, an.
