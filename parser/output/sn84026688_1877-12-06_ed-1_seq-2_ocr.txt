gf ntoctin §lnriau. . ALEX. P. BEATTY, Editor and Proprietor; THUR*SDAIf, DECEMBER 8,1877. NATIONAL AFFAIRS. The extra session glided into the regular session of Congress on Moa dayNkst, and there being no delay in organization the President’s message w*e immediately presented. Being the first annual message of President Hayes it was looked for with unusual intsrest. As it is too lengthy for our apace we give its main points in brief. The financial question is discussed at length. The President favors the faithful execution of the Uw provi ding for specie resumption and depre cates tbe incessant agitation of the subject in Congress. He iloae not fa vor the unlimited remonelhudion of silver. The President makes no lengthy discussion of his Southern policy, but states the views lirhich he entertains of the relations of the two sections and the necessity of a resto ration of harmony. Allusion is also made to the efforts of the administra tion in the direction of civil service reform. Although difficult to carry into successful and satisfactory execu tion in the present state of party ma chinery and feeling he earnestly ar gues tbe necessity of civil service re form, so that a wise and beneficial administration of the Government shall not so continually be interfered with by the influence of party patron age and party factions. The message is in tbe main a sensible, frank and patriotic paper, free from any taint of partisanship and pervaded by a spirit of wholesome earnestness. A 

PARTY CRISIS. Last spring the destinies of the country hung tremblingly for mtfny days on the magic figures Bto 7. Last week the repub licans of the Senate passed through a similar crisis. As they suddenly woke up to the reality that thestste of par ties stood 39 to 37, with two republi cans mighty uncertain, there was no 1 little consternation in the. ranks.— Their control of the Senate seemed to be suddenly coming to an end. They were not working in harmony nt the best. A number of prominent sena- i tors are very sore-headed. The Pres idents course is not to their liking.— But now their party supremacy was in utmost peril. The wrangling of factions must cease . It would take skilful engineering and cool beads in the leadership to avert disaster and wreck. The air was full of rumors with tbe House democratic, and the Senate rushing to the same condition. The alarming rumor took foot that Tilden might attempt a desperate dash for the Presidential chair in the French style. The crisis wa serious. Tbe republican press sounded tbe| alarm. Anxious solicitude prevailed in the party ranks as they watched the greatest contest which now com menced with the energy of a death struggle and lasted for a full week. Tbe sudden trouble was that Con over, of Florida, and Patterson of South Carolina, both republicans, showed signs of kicking in the traces. Patterson is in a delicate situation.— An indictment is hanging over hi* head which may possibly transfer him to an institution not half so cheerfully j ventilated as tbe Senate. No wonder his wrath rose at bearing such fre- > quent allusions to the penitentiary.— I He admitted he was going to vote fori the admission of the democratic claim- 1 ant from South Carolina to a seat in l the senate. But he was in no unholy! alliance with tbe democrats. His re-' publicanism, be said, would bear fa-J vorable comparison with that of the present occupant of the Presidential < mansion. Congress took the floor to I make like expressions. Both parties' were wrought up to high excitement. ■ The republicans feared defeat—the' democrats feared disappointment after all. A full week was consumed in ( adroit parliamentary tactics and time killing speeches. The contest was finally ended two hours after midnight on Friday with' the admission of Kellog from Louisi> ana, by a vote of 30 to 28, and But- 1 ler from South Carolina by 29 to 28, which is a gain of one Senator to each arty, Sharon, of Nevada, republi-j can, stays away from the Senate to attend to his big silver mine. If.he will attend to his duty as he ought, and Patterson keeps clear of that other ugly institution, the republicans may reasonably expect freedom from an other such scare during this session. Let us have peace. NEWS OF THE WEEK. Carl Messner, who was ort-dml in New York, on the charge of killing his brother, John, was acquitted Wednesday. Thos. Cooley was killed and Thos.

Gaily Bond who stands charged with the murder of L. S. Hill, an old planter residing in Memphis, Tenn., in December last, was arrested on Sat urday and incarcerated in De Sotojail.

It is reported that seventeen hun dred of the Indians on the ttiarch to , tbe new reservation on the Missouri ■ river have stampeded and left the 1 main body. This parly of Indians was joined by 2,800 others when they started, and tbe short rations caused by this large increase in the number ,to be provided for may have caused i the stampede if it Ipas occurred: ji Isaac Evans, an aged .and infirm "colored man, residing ; along the, ’! mountain, near BurkiUaville,’ who is r unable to support hindself, and is r without friends willing to keep him, • was taken to Moatevue Hospital on Sunday last. Fanny Blair, a bright mulatto girl, has been arrested in Charles county, and committed to jail, on the charge of murdering her fifteen months old i child by throwing it into an unused ; well near Beantown.

Last Thursday, when the grand ju ry of Montgomery county asked to be \ discharged for the term, the court in structed them to return to their room and inquire through whos# neglect the county jail still remains in a dan gerous and terrible condition, not _ withstanding frequent reports of grand juries as to the matter.
