Don'l forgot to think of a union dot - t > ot. Sometimes JIIRI. thinking of things , makes thnni come tniu. Tlio vnluo of porHlRtcuco can m-areo- ly hu overestimated UH a factor In RIICCOSS. "Novor give up IH tlio secret of glory. " Senator ( Ionium of Maryland IH pre pared to join bin frlonil Dave Hill of Now York In thu realms of Inocnoim domiOtUdO. It WIIH suggested Saturday .after ( ho Northwestern depot burned here , that perhaps Fremont , hired Hoinoliody to ttot thu building allro. Hum ! your Christmas packages In good season , In order that they won't ho delayed by the congested Iralllc along toward the laHt day or HO. The Hlinplo llfo IH the only ono worth living. And yet many people are possessed to spend both time and money In trying to escape from It. Never In Iho history of the country waH there Hiich prosperity as ( here IH nt present. Thin IH attested by the bank clearings which exceed these ol nny provloiw year. A son of millionaire kissed a De troit girl , UH nho alleges , without her consent , and she IUIH sued him for $10 , < 000. Nothing llko slozlng an oppor tunity. And now they Hay Hood Smoot II hlH grip with his Mormon broth- ron. Snroly with the women of the country after bin senatorial scalp , the lines have not fallen to him In pleasant places. The auctioneer who drew such .1 charming picture of their farm that thu old people who owned It and wanted to soil , decided to keep It , was certainly possessed of the power of eloquence. It's an excellent Ihlug to bo popular , but If ono has to choose , It's a more excellent thing to bo honored. There nro many men who can never bo pop ular who are always honored wher ever they go. If the three railroad companies lead ing Into Norfolk know how much the people of this city want and wish for a union depot , tliolr ears would burn. Could It bo that that was what made ono of the old depots burn ? Minneapolis objects to Collier's story of football graft 1" Minnesota. Collier's Is now being denounced In Minneapolis as a yellow Journal which "raises h 11 and sells papers , " but which bases Its sensations on a thin foundation of fact. For the first time on a first day In congress , the representatives at Wash ington yesterday had ( o receive their floral offerings In the lobby. Herulo- fore they have received bouquets on their desks. Isn't that rather harden on the popular ones ? It Is told of a Norfolk man that ho can never endure the odor of vinegar nt homo In the slightest degree , and j that ho sits In his olllco eight hours a day , with a terrlllc odor of vinegar permeating the air , without ever even realizing what it Is that ho whiffs. The Minneapolis Journal says that the record Nebraska has made In pos sessing the least percentage of Illit erate children , Is due to the eagerness of the children to read Col , Hlxby's sharp verses. Which Is a well de served compliment for the Nebraska poet. It now appears that the reason the "Plorodora" theatrical company can celled a date hero last week by wire was not , as the message said , that "threo 'leading members of the com pany were severely 111 , " but was an illness In the treasury. The troupe Is stranded in Fremont , nnd cancelled a date at Columbus as well. It Is generally admitted that the coming session of congress , which opens today , promises to bo the most Important of any since the days of ho civil war. Now probloniH are up vlilch eongroHH must face. . The IHHIIOH vlll bo watched with InturoHt and will liu'ioly ; foreshadow the IHHIIOH of thu presidential campaign of 1U08. There WIIH a time when thu North- tvoHlorn road contemplated on run- .ilng It n main line tralim Into Norfolk nun Ihe eiiHt by way of the M. & O. traoltH , Joining I hose rails east of ( own ind coming In by way of the Union I'aclllc depot. Wouldn't thin bo a good line to do something of that sort , now hat a now Htatlon must bo built any- Hotter mall service for Norfolk would come with a union dopot. People ple could drop loiters Into thu post- illlco at 1:1:15 : : , noon , for liiHtance , lo witch the cHHlhound mall , whore they now have to llnlnh those leltern a half hour earlier. With the traliiH bringing the mall to Norfolk avenue , It would ilno mean that ( he malls would be distributed a half hour quicker. School hook puhllBhort ! are at war in Iowa and In Minnesota a Htato Inspector specter of HL'ImnlH condemiiH their po litical pullH. There IH no doubt but that there ban been a tremundotiH amount of graft on the part of some of the educational publishing IIOUHOH of the country In many of the states. It may be of potty dlmciiHlonH In ono case but when the volume of htiBlncHH traiiHacted IH considered as a whole , It rises to tremondoiiH proportion.1) ) . It IH a great deal castor to bo a Itleker than It IH to bo a "booster. " That Is why there are numerous kick- oi'H. It IH natural lo follow the line of Ir.iiHt rcnlHtanco , but It Hhould al ways be berne In mind that a capacity for crltlclnm Is no capacity for action and It Is always ( ho man who does thlngH who Is held In high esteem. The world Is always In want of con structive energy and the men who can. supply It are the most valuable mem bers of society. The only newspaper In the stale of Nebraska , so far as wo have IIH yet boon able ( o discover , to publish Pres ident Hoosevolt'H message In UH com plete , unabridged form , was The Nor folk Dally NOWH. Omaha , Lincoln and Sioux City papers cut down the mes sage and brought it Into this territory yesterday. The News gave it in com plete form and sent it out Tuesday afternoon to this whole territory ra diating from Norfolk. In that way people living north read the message twenty-four hours quicker in Tlio NOWH than In any other paper which is In keeping with the general policy of the paper In a news way every time anything happens. Fremont nays that It Is porhapn just as well to lot go unchallenged the statement from Norfolk to the effect that the change made yesterday by the Northwestern , In transferring Mr. NValtorH to Fremont , Is not necessarily permanent. "For , " says the Tribune , "It makes Norfolk feel bettor and doesn't hurt Fremont. " Norfolk IB now ready to admit that ( ho change IB , In all probability , permanent. Nor folk further concedes that the changen made some time ago , when division headquarters wore abolished at Fre mont and the general superiutondency moved here , are also permanent. Hut that gives Fremont a chance to feel badly and perhaps we'd bettor keep It dark. The Nebraska State Journal very Interestingly sums up Secretary Taft's Journoylngs during the last five years and says , "This popular and ponderous statesman is making a record as a traveler which has been exceeded by few Important olllclals. Of the five and one half years which have passed since Judge Tart left the bench to become governor of the Philippines , ono year lacking flvo days has been spent on the ocean , mainly In his trips to and from the Philippines. Six weeks have been spent on trains in this time. It Is estimated that the distance traveled by Mr. Taft In these journeys has been equivalent to four trips around the world. " Ono comfort a man of Secretary Taft's avoirdu pols must feel sure that ho gets his money's worth as ho Is transported from place to place. The Christinas shopping season is on , nnd people are beginning to get busy with the gifts which are to bo made to friends. If the public would only remember its friends do not ex poet expensive gifts , if girts they ex poet at all , nnd that tnsto and a desire sire to please with some little trinket that Is appropriate , will bo moro ap predated than a girt which , thougl costly , Is useless to the recipient Christmas Joys would bo greater am the public's pocketbook go around bet ter. If you happen to know that your friend has a set of Dickons' works don't , for goodness sake , dollberatelj buy him a copy of "Copporfleld , " am expect him to bo delighted. Try not to give red flowers to the girl with auburn hair , nnd don't expect candy to make the person with stomach trouble , happy. Use a llttlo Judgment and you will have a mdrrlor Chrlsl- man. , THAT MINNESOTA ( JAMH. It IH , perhaps , no wonder that Coach llooth and the cornhiiHkcrH did not win at MlnnonpollH on the football Held i few weeks ago , and that the iicoro WIIH so much agaliiHt them. llooth at leant plays clean football , and his team IH taught to play no foiilH. Hu Man made Minnesota and all of ( ho roBt of the western teaniH fear Nobranka and the game Thanksgiving day HIOWH ! ( hat the boys mill retain some of their old Hklll. Concerning tho" manner In which Minnesota works lo beat No- liraHka , an arllelo In Collier's HayH : Nebraska had ( aught her rival , and In the annual game between those col- logcH laHt fall MlnnoHola played 'two men who wore entered for participa tion In thlH giimo only , and a third who wan In college for football alone. Ush er I , . Iliirdlek of Mandan , North Da kota , a former Minnesota end , who had left college In Juno , wan Hollelted to return by Mr. Frank Force , sport ing editor of the Minneapolis "Tri bune , " WIIB promised a position in one of the llennepln county olllcen , and came back for the Nebraska game , lie appeared for a short preliminary practice ; the Htyln of play was changed to his advantage and ho played al end , leaving college Immo dlatoly afterward to return to hid wife and home In North Dakota. The statement mont IH made that ho entered college and paid hlH fees. If ho did , the de ception WIIH more complete. Jordan , the writer , goeH on to say : "Does Minnesota over biro men out right ? " I asked. "I don't bollovo nny ono docs that any more , " ho replied. "Men hired In thai way are not good players. Wo hired a laundry-wagon driver once , a big husky fellow ( thin man's name vaH Irwln ) , lo go out and play on the earn , but ho waH no good. The only vay to lake care of men Is to got them elm whore they have to work. Still remember a ease In which I was lecelved. 1 heard of a fellow and got ilm a $ ( ! 0-a-month job. Ho came lown , entered college , and stuck for a 'ew days. Then he quit , the team and leld hlH Job. " After all , Nebraska prefers clean 'ootball to victories , and Booth is a clean coach. It is reported from Lin- coin that Hooth has but to say the word and no other coach will be ever suggested for next year. DANOHH IN POLITICS. There IH enormous risk In the hold lug of a political olllce , especially for a young man , but even so for the old ind the man who accepts an olllce oven though It Is apparent that ho lights to get Into It , Is taking on him self grave responsibilities which , it many cases , are too heavy to bo with stood and which , us a consequence many times break down the olllcehold er and carry him to ruin. So often ban this fact been demonstrated stratod , to the sorrow of the prlncl pals and their friends , In Nebraska alone , that the young man of todaj must measure himself pretty thorough ly , and honestly too , before ho wouh venture Into politics. George Wash Ington said that honesty was the bos policy In his day. Many people have doubted his wlsdow In Its appllcatlot to modern day business , but not a da > passes which does not bring in the telegraphic dispatches the most po tent arguments for George Washing ton's maxim. Norfolk people nnd these of north ern Nebraska generally were surprlsei yesterday to hear that Register Petti John and Receiver Al Towlo in the Valentino landofllco had been rcmovo < by the president. The advices from Washington say that the removals arc the result of sweeping land office in vestlgations in this state , during whlcl It was discovered that the local ofll cers nt Valentine have , themselves set up dummies to make entries 01 government land , nnd that these ofll cers have been In collusion with 11 legal land fencers and have profile thereby. There is no .mincing o words In the reporl of the president and the verdict must bo accepted a true. People hero regrotled to hear of tin downfall or Towlc , especially , becuus he has been known in this countr ; ror many years. Ho was present a the first spelling school ever held in Norfolk and It Is said by these win were presenl that ho was next to tin last person down , finally falling on thi word "synagogue. " It would hav been a blessing to Towlo and hi friends if ho had stayed down whet he fell over that word. Hut ho didn't Ho went Into politics , securing a lorn of office as county clerk in Knox conn ty and later was elected to the slat leglslalure. After that ho secured ar polntmcnt lo Valentine , and had bcci there for eight years. A few mon could nave withstood tbj temptation out there nt Valentino , ti make false entries where Ihoro wa profit in It , but a great many mermen men could not have withstood tha temptation any moro than did A Towlo. The opportunities were to < great. And that is the trouble wltl many or our political offices. The ffor too great opportunities and lee irclbly tempt , frnll man. Time arior llino wo rend of county roaHiirerH going wrong ; the O'Neill auk failure , Ihough not a political Dice , HlgnllloH the same point. The I her day a clerk Tor an express com- any Hlolo $101,000 and ( led , only to u captured within a week and scut o prlHon. Norfolk sent ono man lo ho olllco of Htnto auditor In Nebraska , vim went Iho muno route. And the one great point In It all , the no fact lo be remembered In cornice- Ion with the whole political olllce eoklng business , IB that , no matter low clover the officeholder may bo. ud 'no mailer how easily Iho oppor- unity prosentH Itself lo him to gralt ud Hleal , ho will ono day be caught. They are all caught , sooner or later. Hornard McOreovy , president of the efiinet O'Neill bank , Is In jail ; hln mining mate , Patrick Haggerty , Is In ildlng , fearing ho will bo caughl. Al 'owlo linn been removed from ofllco nil disgraced and f > o Iho llsl goes.

PHKS1IMONT5S MI3SSAGR The president's message is decidedly Hoosoveltlan , It goes straight to the leart of each of the questions which are of Importance In the United States : oday and he has taken up a lot of questions. In twcnly-sevon columns , iggrogaling perhaps 35,000 words , President Hoosovelt addresses himself to the congress that has Just convened , and recommends Ihelr action upon a number of vital subjccls. Perhaps Ibis is the most Important president's message thai has been de livered In many a year ; cerlalnly it Is ono which has been awaited by the people of the United States as eagerly as tyiy which has been sent to con gress In a decade. And It Is not dis appointing. It is not surprising , ei ther , for the matter of that ; it is mere ly reassuring. The views of the president on all loplcs of vital Importance were too well known in advance , lo allow many surprises to bo sprung in the mes sago. To read It is but to find , in clear-cut , definite language , Iho Ideas thai we all knew beforehand lo be possessed by Mr. Roosevell. Regarding Iho Irusts and by this II Is well known that President Roosevelt velt refers to the beef trust and other trusts of that typo no definite remedy for Iho evils existing today , is suggest ed. "Until the national government obtains In some manner which the wisdom of congress may suggest prop er control over the big corporations en gaged in interstate commerce , It wll be Impossible to deal adequately will Ihese evils , " says the message. All ol which Is a significant ndmisslan Ihat the law as It now stands , and bj which the so-called beef trusl mag nates were reconlly lei off afler being Indicted , Is Insulllclcnt to do anything Although It Is true , as the message says , that good effect will be felt In a moral way as a result , of the expos ing of the beef men , yet the evil has not been remedied and can not be How to break up the evils of the com blnatlous called trusls and this af fects the very life of every person in the country is still a perplexing prob loin , left to the wisdom of congress. The railway rale quesllon , of course is one of prominence jusl now , Ihougl Iho views of the president are no now thing to the counlry. Ho favors glv Ing lo Ihe interstate commerce com mission power , when they have heard complaints of a railroad rate and have Invesllgaled , lo fix Ihen am Ihero a maximum rate that can be charged by the railroad , and that rate shall go Into effect and remain In of feet until It Is reviewed by the courts If the railroad wishes to appeal. As it now stands , the Interslalo commerce morco commission may render a judgment mont , bul thai judgment Is In no wa > binding on the railroads and there may bo years of delay In the courls before Jusllco is secured. It is predicted by politicians thai It 190S ono of Iho paramount Issues wll bo the government ownership of rail roads. Hryan Is abroad studying tha question now. President Roosevelt comes out IIfitly against ( his. He says ho believes In the government ownership of only these llilngs whlcl cnn nol bo controlled by prlvalo Inler > sts. And ho further says that it Is in order to make government owner ship useless , and to protecl ( ho hones' ' rillrond men and the honest shippers tint I'o desires a railway rate regula tlon by Interstate commerce comnila < lo : nrs , giving justice to small cities an. ' Vg cities , tlio big ' i 1 tin small. President Roosevelt expresses no ' ; 'llty ' toward railway ' csts n ' " 'm ' makes It a polrt tplalu that ho Is not hostile to them. Hr glvofl Iho railroads credit for what they have done. The theory of Chancellor Andrews , that wo Hhould admire thoHo who make a success of llfo and who , by honest methods , accumulate wealth which will do good lo soclely at large , Is uphold by the president , who speaks well against any hatred of Iho rich , or haired of any other chiHS. KnormoiiH death llslR In railway nc cldeulH in the past year , duo lo a lacl. of safely appliances and to overwork of railway employes , cause the presi dent to speak a timely word In favor > f moro government Inspection of the ilock systems and of shorter hours of 'allway ' employes as an obligation to ho public whoso lives are Imperiled vhon these men are overworked Into Unpldlty , as was Iho case down in KHourl laHt spring when twenty-one voro killed. The president advises nnd his ad- Ice IH good that laborers anil em- doycrs Hhould get together and talk > ver their problems rather than assume - sumo an ntlltude of haired. He cm- aHi/.cH the fact Hint Iho public has an Interest In the labor question bo- innso the public Is affected and that he rights of the public must bo pro served. Ho sayn Iho labor problem Is nlrlcalo and dllllcull , bul that there shall bo a square deal for all and that nil must obey the laws. Ho dlscourag is the spirit which prompts workmen o hate , their employers because the employers make money , for , ho says , .ho benefit Is far reaching , and ox .ends to the workmen as well as em- iloyers. And labor disturbances but servo to set back Iho whole procession Ihat much. Tariff revision on all articles from .ho Philippines to this country except ug sugar and tobacco , Is urged by the message , and oven on these articles , the president would cut down the tariff to one-fourth Its present sl/.o in 1909. Regarding the Panama canal pro ect , the president assures the people thai Iho work will be pushed rapidly , ilo hopes to soon lay before congress Iho findings of Ihe advisory board ivhom ho has chosen lo Invesllgale the advisability of making the canal one ivlth single scalovel lock or with many ocks. The assurance that the canal ivill speedily go through Is satisfying. While Chinese coolies cheap lauor ers who do not help the counlry should bo kept out rigidly , Mr , Reese veil would favor admitting decent Chinese neso , such as doctors , professional men and students , just the same as these from other nalions , and Ihlf perhaps is Iheoretically right , though no doubt there will arise a puzzle as to Just where to draw the line. And while he is on that subject , it might bo suggested that those Immigrants from other nations who tend to cheap en labor and whoso ways of living are not good , ought as well to bo excluded The cattle grazing land In Nebraska and particularly in the neighborhood of O'Neill and Holt county , comes Infer for some of the president's atlenllon Ho speaks of the C-10-acrc homesteads and of the plans to spread them Into other stales. He thinks that even C-10 acres of some of the arid land are not enough to support a family and that inasmuch as fraud is likely to develop through such large tracts , the govern ment should keep an eye on the lands and the plan should not be hastily spread. Insurance scandals are mentlonec and It Is urged thai Ihe government bo given supervision over Interslalo In surance. On Ihe whole , the message is ono of the most exhaustive , complete am clear cut thai has been presented to congress In an ordinary year.
