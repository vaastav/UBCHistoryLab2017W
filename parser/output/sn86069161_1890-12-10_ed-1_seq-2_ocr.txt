CHEAP RAILUUAU iAUKS We gave a short time since an ace tint of the zone tariff svstem of railway fares adopted in Hungary and the really re markable results that have accrued It has proved that cheap railway fan rying a jiassenger for the same Mini over a distance of ten miles and parting up the cost for every additional ten miles the charge in even- instance being at the lowest ossible rate will produce profit to the railroad esssnssnea than fares that are charged by the mile The success of the Hungarian system of zones has been so marked that it has bees introduced in Austria anil the surprising results have just lieen described ly Prof E J James liefore the Manufacturers Club of Philadelphia There as else where on the continent and in England irs are divided into three classes first second and third class and the rates of fare are charged accordingly The zone system in Austria retains the same classification but reduces the rate of fare projiortionately in all The most remarkable effect ie the increase of jias senger railway traffic by second and third class That it should be so is saw at all wonderful It is but another illus tration of the change that was brought alout by the reduction of the price of letters to two and carrying the reduction through all departments of the mail ser rding to Prof James Aus tria has now the cheat est railroad fares in the world usual rate for third class Is ing only six and a half mills jer mile r six dollars and fifty cents for one thousand miles while it costs in the Fnited States from twenty to thirty dol lars to travel the same distance Com mutation tickets he says are still lower Forlsesl travel a workman can l to and from his work for two cents s trip up to six miles for four cents up to twelve miles six cents up to eighteen miles and ten cents up to thirty miles Yearly tickets g hk for thirty mile trips Id for seventeen dollars and forty cents The most curious tiling he hat these fares are proving inle to the railroads from the enormous increase in passenger traffic Prof Jsssei regards this sue a cheep fares on the Austrian and Hun garian roads as suggestive of the still greater profit to be derived from the zone system on American roads C N CLAY JR -
