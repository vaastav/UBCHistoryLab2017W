His opinions and rdtommondntioiis on important qii sdona of .iiolicy are often wholly itiiler eut from thci which he transmits in the re poiiri of his cabinet advisers. The World says: Toe message cou tains a foroihlu suggest icm for the treatment of polyg amy. It is the repeal of the act on which the preynt government of Utah depends, the as sumption by the national legislature of tlieen tire jxjlittoul control of , the territory, and the establishment of, a commission to hold authority over it. This favors strongly of absolutism. Ob the whole, the invssngB is an interesting document, containing some evidence of independence, some suggestions if whioh 'we ti jmrove an I much that wo stronglyVondemti. It will repay perusal. The Tribune says: Whatever the apol ogists may 6ay now, five trade has become the question of the campaign, and if tlio Democracy is afraid to mwt it the election goes by default. It is too late to change. Chh'aho, T'ec. 5 The Tribune says: The president's message will impn-s-s the render as a conservative and cautions document. There is an occasional intimation of a de.dre to rosrioiiil to progressive public sentiment in the matter of taxation and tlnvrugnja tion of monopolies, but it is repressed for the most part in appuivut deference to the "biuiDess interests" of which tho country hasntsardsoiime.il during the contest over the'speakor'a chair. His recommendations, as a rule, are in the right directiou, and it is ruber the omissions than the assertions which will encounter criticism. The Herald says:. President Arthur has apparently contented bims-elf with calling at tention to the views of bis subordinates, and generally approving them. Ill other words, the message is like those of Oram's, which his followers so pre tended to admire it is "a business message." While not a man-el in breadth of thought or comprehensive statesmanship, is yet a simple, plain and effective statement of the condition of oiir national affairs. V- . Cincinnati, Dec. C The Enquirer says that the message is not a tlirillinj document, but the kind of a communication which ougth to be expected from a president who is a candidate for re-eleotioii, aud who man ures ills i-anipmgll its a poinii-imi imnei than as a man of principles aud statesman ship. The Commercial Gamttesays: The message is an unpretending but dignified and able state paper, which contains so much that, after reading it, one is surprised to see that it is so short. Lot'isviLLE, Ky.J Pec. 6 The Courier Journal says: There is nothing which tst.ities more einpalhicallj" to the general tranquility of the nation than the utterly uninteresting character of the president1- message.- ft i dull from end to end. St. Louis, Dec. 6. The (! lobe-Democrat says: The message strikes the average reader as being a dreidodly careful one from a political point of view, ami, barring some omissions slid R lank of stress on one or two points where ' more extended treatment was expected, is statesmanlike and wia. New Orleans, Dec. (1. The Tinies-T)efno-erat says: In fine, whilo tho message con tains nothing refy startling , or novel, it is sensible and conservative, unsectional, and unpartisan. We may not W nhle to accept a" of Arthur's views, but a great majority them will strongly recommend themselves to ihe country. What the KtBtcxnien Hay. Washington City, Dec. 0 A numlier of congressman have been interviewed in regard to the president's message; subjoined are a few of the opinions expressed: Senator Mitchell "flf Pennsylvania, said:. President Arthur is very practical and his message busuffss-like and to the point. I did not, hear any reference to the coinage of silver, how ever, as I had expected. Senator Logan, of Illinois: It is a very good fnessagp. There nru some good points iu it upon which tho president und myself disagree, but as a whole it is a very accept able document. ' ' - Senator Hawley was asked what he thought of it. He said: Well, from what I was able to understand of It I should say it is a very able document It covers a great many sub jects and commends reflection. Senator Keck said: It is very indifferent, It means that the president will tlirow the entire responsibility for legislation as to revenues and tariff upon congress. Senator AlUeonJamarkedT 1,-shoiiId say it is a good message; not so pronounofd some particulars as that of last year, ir- haps. The proposition to rehabilitate the navy created more favorable comment than any other portion, as even the senators from the interior begin to feel that it is a foolhardy policy to allow tho couutay to go aloug for years in a perfectly defenseless condition. Senator Aldrich, of Rhode Island: I fully agree with every suggestion mailo by tlie president ' Senator Jones, of Florida: It is an emi nently practical document, and worthy ol serious consideration by every thinking inan. Seuator Groome, of Maryland: It is one of the strongest business communications that 1 have ever'beard, The Foreign Press. London, Dec. 6. The Times thinks Presi dent Arthur's message is somewhat colorless, and sees a tribute to the Irish vote in the Inn guage used in regard to pauper emigrants.

YOUNG NUTT'S TRIAL. Difficulty in Obtaining a Jary -The 'H Hceae im Court. Unioxtoww, Pa., Deo. 6. At 9 o'clock a. am., the Nutt trial began in the criminal court before Judge Wilson, Judge-elect Ingraham sitting on the bench with him, through tbe courtesy of the court Senator Voorhees arrived from Connellsville, and came into court accom panied by Marshal Swartzwalder 'and Mnjor Brown, of Pittsburg, representing the defense. Messrs. Patterson and Boyd, prose cuting attorneys, remained seated at the counsel table a few minutes, and then Sena tor Voorhees was presented to the court. On motion of Mr. Playford Senator Voorhees and Major Brown were then admitted to the bar. When both sides reported that they were ready Jair.c utt himself thenjstooif up anil said he was not guilty of murder. Mrs. Nutt dressed in deep mourning sat with her son, James, being at her right hand and her brother, (Jamas Wells) at her left, James 'jCutt, wasja cool and calm as the judge. His face was pale. His plea of not guilty was made in a low but firm tone of voice. A panel of jurors was called, nearly all answering, and the work of selecting the jury began. The prothonotary informed the prisoner that he had a right to object per emptorily to twenty-five jurors, and as many as he chose for cause. William Stewart, the first man called, was objected to because he had to a certain extent already made up his mind in te case. Then nineteen more were called and were not acceptable. The twenty-first man called was William A. Mc Dowell, to whom no objection was made, and he was therefore enrolled as a juror. " The number of newspaper men present is remarkable, nearly every (prominent paper in the state and in the east having a special correspondent here. Sire. Nutt is the only woman present.andshenevcrximoveshereyias from each man while he is being questioned. Shortly before noon fifty names had been called without a single" juror having being accepted save McDowell. The court then took recess until 2 o'clock. 

MORRISON FOR PRESIDENT. A t'onplr of ('nrreopondentil Nee Hi ltoom Cumins. ' Cincinnati, Dec. 0. -rbel-jiqairer'sWasbr ington corresjiondeut telegraphs: There is go ing to be troubio after ull among the Demo cratie presidential candidates in the west Up to the time the speakership canvass grew warm, there was the general belief that Car lisle's success meant an opening overture in. favor of McDonald. He was pushed by rep resentatives from free trade states supposed to le for McDonald as a free trade candidate. Since the caucus, however, there is reason to believe that Morrison, of Illinois, is to be pushed as the beneficiary of whatever there may l in Carlisle's elec tion. Already one hears that the Democratic candidate must come from the west, and the friends of Morrison are not only active but ' demonstrative. Mor rison himself gives open encouragement. It is all-early beginning to dawn on the minds of Mcl louuld's friends that theTe is to be an effort made to squelch their candidate, and to build up Morrison at bis expense. It is not Known whether Mr. Carlisle is aware of the ;novemejit, but ho could not well be contrary to it in view of the accive part Morrison took iu his behalf. It can further lie noted that Morrison is discussed with more favor than McDonald by the revenue reformers, The argument fc used that his position ou tho tariff is more explicit than that of McDonald; that he has the advantage ef having a military record; that Ids public life is open to no misconstruc tion, and that if the candidate js to stand on the platform of a tariff for revenue only and come from the west, he is the man. New VptiK, Dec. 4.-"Gath" says: Mr. Morrison may himself become a presidential quantity unless the tariff question should produce such general alarm that the Demo crats will fly to a quasi protectionist for their candidate.

Carlisle's Election Brings the Tariff ta the Front t Home Traditions ef the Question Ob jections to the Present System Stated Wie fra on Salt and Lumber. Cincinnati, Dee. 6. The Enquier's JTew York correspondent seDds the following: The speakership being Jecided iu ayor of Mr. Carlisle, the tariff q'tlfsiloh coines out to the front The south and the north west which accomplished this victory Lava far different reasons for hostility to the tariff system. In the south this opposition may ho called a f or ciji policy, that being the only method of war left against the dominant an-l busy north. Besides, free traile has a traditional value in the south, coining from nulliucation times. It belongs to that class of questions -in the south called states' rights intimating th:it the government at large must hot do any thing, tree trade in this country was first taught by Judge Coopur, an Englishman from I'eunsyl vauia, in his leetures before the South Carolina college. These lectures constitute, jierhaps, the rarest book on the subject at the present time. Calhoun, toward the end of his life, as at the beginning, was rather a renegade to. free trade. By nature he was not a state's rights man at all, lint a national man, and only t.'h i: r' :. j.-,;--: ion to put himself in aformid-lil,,-1-i:iie ol promotion at Washington city, lie wanted to lie president, anil if not presi dent, the chief antagonist of the president; His early writings were strongly protective. AVhen he got into the snarl with President Jackson, who was of the same blood and state as himself, he allowed the Whigs to ex tricate him from the nullification ruse by joining with them to pass a taritf. Yet theso points are imperfectly known through tho smith, and the -youflg people there consider tliat to soine extent free trade and secession are, twin traditions, j.1 - v . . t.

That doctrine has a generous flavor and attracts young radicals and, idealists,-particularly those who have traveled in Europe and do not like, custom-houses and to see their comforts taxed. Some portions of the taritf are absurd, and if our people came as closely in contact w ith it as those who re turn from pprope, a bninidous vote would lie polled agahlsl it.

The election tf Mr. Carlisle will, I think, tend to simplify the tariff at least.' His election uuquestioiv aldy brihgs matters or revenue right to the front, and if the Republican party in congress merely oppose, without investigation, every tariff improvement, ; tlioy -may sueoecd iu electing another' president, but they will nut retard the agitation of this subject in emi gres. ,, , r . -; The state ol New York might even be lost by the Democrats on the tariff question mid tbey sweep toe country in the northwest.

I apprehend that dunag the liresent cou- gi ess the lumber tori ft will go and I think the salt tariff also. Tlie salt question is a peculiar one.

He says: "Tins is that - 'entertainment to which southern sectionalism invites the Democracy. It would give Virginia back to Mahone, it would make North Carolina, Louisiana, Ala liama, Tennessee and West Virginia doubtful and it would leave the Democrats without the-bope of a single electoral vote in the northern states. Such is the outlook, 'and only the resolute reversal of the sectional policy declared by the house can give the Democrats the remotest chance to contest the election of a president next year. From this day until the Democratic people shall unmistaka bly repudiate the sectionalism of their party leaders in congress no conservative Republi can will be withfn ranee of tha next presi- tdential nomination.
