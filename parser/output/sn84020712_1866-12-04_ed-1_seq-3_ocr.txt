T HE WESTERN . DEMOCRAT,' . CHARLOTTE, N. Cl s - '-..1 tmoctat. W. J. YATES, Editor and Proprietor. CHARLOTTE, IV. C. December 4, 18GG. 'What is the matter wi.h Mr Yates of the Char lotte Democrat? Last summer we heard him speak rather in favor of the adop.ion of the Constitution as amended by the so-called bogus Convention. Next we bear him talking rather strangely about the Howard Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Now we hear him urging the Legislature to abolish the offices of Adjutant General and State Geologist. uese iim, it is irue, 11 aooil?ueu, would prod little saving to '.he State, but nothing compared ! uce-a the ameuded Constitution had been adopted, we J of worthless characters who have no visible hahi should have had a Lieut. Governor to pav. Not ! tation or means of making a living, and who much to be sure, but something while on duty. We j would not fenr to commit crime if they knew that are opposed to the abolition of the offices of the ; confinement in thp Penitentiary, where they might Adjutant General and that of State Geologist, be- I learn a trade and cet well fed and clothed, was cause e iiiiiik iney are important, ami as a Stale should not be without them. But what is the matter with fr.end Yates? He is a gentleman of prudence and sagacity, and usually right. We fear he is wrong Salisbury Banner, No vtmbtr 10A. For some time past we have refrained from writing anything about Federal politics, believ ing that it would do no good for Southern Editors to meddle in such matters at present. We have Deen content to merely keep our readers posted ! in regard to passing events and the actual Condi- j tion of affairs, waiting for a more proper time to ! i . . i , . ' . ; give our own indtvtdualvtews. The above para- ! graph from the Salisbury Banner is couched in ; ucu pome ana inruuiy terms that we ought not j A. . !l , l w pass it over in silence. We assure the Banner that there is nothing the matter with us but an earnest desire to .ee peace restored to the country, good feeling prevail among all our people, and perfect security for 1 persons and property. We are individually, as) well as generally, interested in this matter, and without meaning to boast we will say that we have as much property and as large a family de pendent on the proper settlement of national af fairs as the majority of our citizens who take an interest in such matters. In the South we expect to live and die. and if any one were to assert that we are not fully identified with the Southern people, we should feel disposed to say that he was guilty of falsehood. We want no office for ourself. and would accept of none neither have we any particular favorites to elevate. We were decidedly in favor of ratifying the new Constitution adopted by the late Convention. It was an improvement on the old Constitution, and if it hud been adopted our Courts would have been relieved of trying numerous cases that might be. settled by a Justice of the Peace, thus saving the counties heavy expense. Besides, the busi ness before our State Legislature would have been expedited, and log-rolling' and bargain ing" prevented hy that provi.-ion in the new Con stitution which forbid the election of a member of the Legislature to any office. It has been too much the practice for men to go to the Legis lature for the purpose of having themselves elect ed to some other office. The late Convention was not a bogus assemblage if it was bogus, then we have a set of bogus State officers. Judges, etc.. because they wtre elected by authority of that Convention. We have uttered no strange sounds about the Howard amendment wo stand by what we have heretofore said, viz : that we would prefer thut the Southern States should adopt that amendment rather than have all our State officers turned out. a Provisional Government re-established, negro suffrage forced upon us, large bodies of U. S. soldiers quartered in the South, and probably confiscation enforced. We don't like the amend- j incut, but we have feared that unless the amend ment was adopted we should have to endure and submit to a great deal worse terms. For express ing these views we have been called timid. We make no pretentions to much bravery, but we claim to be cautious, and, as a public journalist, actuated by a sincere desire to promote the com mon welfare of our people. We are not disposed to reproach or denounce those who oppose the amendment, but we must be allowed to say that it is au easy matter for many men who have nothing to lose to denounce and defy the powers that be, and talk big words. We do not claim to be more patriotic, or wise, or far seeing, than many others, but we respectfully submit that if the times and circumstances do not require prudence in language and caution in ac tion on the part of those who must suffer greatly if our national difficulties are not speedily settled. It is said that an effort is being made to effect a compromise between the President and Con gress on the basis of permitting negro suffrage. If such an arrangement is made we shall expect to see. our frieud of the Salisbury Banner and j many others who are now declaiming against the Howard amendment, proclaiming in favor of it. For our own part, we prefer that the question of puffrage should bn left for each State to settle for itself, where we conceive that the Howard amend ment leaves it. If the negroes are permitted to vote, let them understand that we of the South grant them that privilege, and not a Congress in which the South is unrepresented. We believe that by adopting negro suffrage both the whites aud blacks will be greatly injured. The Banner alludes to our proposition to abol ish the offices of State Geologist and Adjutant General. We are still in favor of dispensing with the services of those officers, because they are unnecessary in the present condition of af fairs, and are an expense to the State Treasury. Wh heur a great deal about the importance of practising economy, but whenr we suggest now a paving of money to the State might be effected, our friends of the Salisbury Banner and Raleigh Sentinel object, aud will nut agree to co-operate with us. We respectfully call upon them. Gov. Woith. and the Legislature, to suggest some mode to lessen public expenditures. What is the use of preaching what is not practised ? We are not wrong, but we fear the Banner is rather imprudent if not wrong. Advkti51SO An unusually large number of new advertisements will be found in this issue of our paper. As tbe main source of revenue to a printing office is derivei rom advertising, we ask the indul- gvnee oi our j'nii uiis uiuu nc iunc diiuugniiriiis lo give a larger quantity of reading matter. Rut all ought to read the advertisements sales of property, notices, new goods, &c. Accidentally-. Killed. Mr Henry Bolton, in attempting to descend a flight of stairs leading into the back yard at the Charlotte Hotel on Tuesday night last, fell and struck his head against a stone, which caused his death in about an hour. , He was a citizen of this place, about .36 years old and unmarried. A Penitentiary. Gov. Worth, in his late ! Messngo to the Legislature, recommends the building of a Penitentiary in this State. - Our opinion about the matter will not influence the action of the Legislature one way or the other, .. but w merely want to say that we do not agree with the Governor. I First, we are opposed to this scheme because ! it will require a larger amount of money to erect the buildings and put the establishment in opera tion than the people can spare in their present impoverished condition. The Governor acknowl- I edges that the people are barely able to pay their present taxes, and many are entirely unable to pay their debts, yet he makes recommendations that will certainly increase taxation. Second, we are opposed to building a Peniten tiary because we think it will increase crime by diminishing the terror of our present modes of the only punishment to be inflicted. Hanging and whipping are the best means to diminish crime and lessen the number of evil doers. Third, we are opposed to bringing criminal or pauper labor into competition with our honest, respectable mechanics. If a Penitentiary was erected, of course various mechanical branches would be carried on, and the work would be thrown on the market in competition with that of a highly useful and respectable class of our pop- ulalinn the mechanics. If the State goes into the business of learning criminals trades and the manufacture of harness, saddles, boots, shoes, etc , our present class of mechanics who manu- ,.p wu,j soo be oblid to qu;( tl1(,jP trades and go at something else to sup- vort themselves and families. port Fourth, we do not think the Legislature ought to sanction the recommendation, because the ouesti'n lias heretofore been submitted to the 1 . . , i . .. . .1 people and an overwhelming majority voted against a I enitenttary. Besides the expense of erecting the buildings. purchase of machinery. &c. it. would require a heavy annual appropriation for a few years at least to keep the establishment up. lt is very doubtful whether it would ever pay expenses. m U. S. Senator. It will be seen by the pro ceedings of our State Legislature, that after sev eral ballottings. Judge Manly was elected to the U. S. Senate, in place of John Pool, whose term expires 4th of March next. Unless the test outb is repealed Mr Manly can not take his seat, even if Congress, this winter, declares the State to be in the Union. We feel that we esteem Judge Manly as highly as any man in the State we consider him one of the best men we ever knew, and would gladly see him placed on the Supreme Court Bench but we would not vote him to a position he will never be peimitted to fill, and why the Legisla ture should '-lay him on the shelf" in that way wo cannot understand. m The N- C. Uxivehsity. We regret to learn that the prospects of the College at Chapel Hill are not very good but few students in attendance, and some of them talk of leaving, so we are in formed. The management of the Institution does not give satisfaction. We have no unkind feel ings for the President, Gov. Swain personally we esteem him highly but the opinion prevails that there ought to be a change in the head of the Institution: We are sorry to say this, but we feel it our duty to do so. Sincb the election of Gen. Lee to the Presidency of a College in Vir ginia, it might have been expected that our Uni versity would decay unless some man like Gen. Joe Johnson was placed at its head. Instead of appropriating money out of the State Treasury to support the College, let the Trustees call a meeting and elect Joe Johnston or some other such man President, and in one year the present buildings will not be sufficient to accommodate the large number of students. Mecklenburg Agmcultural Society. A called meeting of the Mecklenburg Agricultural Society was held in the Court House on Satur day the 21th ult. A B Davidson. President, in the Chair, and F Scarr, Secretary. The report of the Chairman of the Executive Committee was read. On motion of J A Young, it was resolved, that J E Brown. E-q., be requested to correspond with the members from the county now at Raleigh in regard to tho recovery of the Property of the Society. On motion, the following gentlemen were ad ded to the Executive Committee: Gen J A Young and J M Hutchison, Eo On motion of J E Brown, it was resolved, that a Committee of five be appointed to report matter for action to a meeting of the Society to be held on Tuesday of January C ourt. The following members were appointed by the Chair : Messrs J E Brown. M L Wriston. Dr J Graham, Dr T K. Curetou and Col Win Grief The U. S. and Mexico. The Mexican ques tion is creating some excitement at present. It is reported that a body of U. S. troops under Gen. Sedgwick crossed the Rio Grande and oc cupied Matamoras, and that a collision has oc curred between the American and French troops The authorities at Washington say that if Gen. Sedgwick has invaded Mexico he did so without orders, and will be arrested. The whole story is doubtful. It is also said that Napoleon has ordered all the French troops to be withdrawu from Mexico 13 We think it is about time for the Confer ences. Synods. Presbyteries, and other religious bodies in the South, to talk a little more about educating the poor white children in our midst, and let the negro question drop for a while. We fear that some people are going crazy on the ne gro-school question. Iluinbuggery. NEW

Recently there have been several sales of property in this city and vicinity, and we are glad to say that the spirit of improvement has got hold of our people and manifesting itself in the erection of new baildings and repairing old ones. There are now between 15 and 25 new houses in course of con struction. Two vacant lots at the corner of the Square in rear of the Mansion House, on Trade street, were sold by Mr J. A. Sadler to Messrs Stenhouse, Macaulay & Co.. for $2000 in gold. Mr John S. Means. living 5 miles North of this town, sold his tract of land containing about 400 acres, to a Northern Company for about $20,000 in gold. There is said to be a gold mine ou the place, and the Company bought it, we presume, for the purpose of working the Mine. Burned to Death. We learn that a child of Mr James Johnston, living near Davidson Col lege, was burned to death on Friday night last by its clothes taking fire. . Agricultural College. We are sorry to feel it our duty to disapprove any of Gov. Worth's recommendations. We believe the Gov ernor to be honest in his opinions and has the good of the State at heart, but like other men he is liable to err and may be mistaken iu his ideas of public policy. By an act of Congress a large quantity of pub lic land was donated to each State to erect and put in operation au Agricultural College. The Governor suggests that North Carolina's share of this fund be used to engraft such a Department in the College at Chapel Hill. We do not think such a disposition of the fund would be prudent or beneficial, unless the management at Chapel Hill is materially changed. At present, scores of our young men are going to Colleges outside the limits of this State Chapel Hill does not sustain the reputation it formerly did and the addition of an Agricultural Department will not much help its stauding. We are opposed to partial dona tions of public property or money. If it is thought best not to establish a separate College for promoting Agriculture, let the fund be fairly divided among all our Colleges, and let an Agri cultural Chair be supported iu each. Let Chapel Hill take its chance among other institutions. and let the institution be conducted iu a more energetic and economical manner. It might be better, for the present, to leave the fund in the hands of the State authorities, unap propriated. - -- - m m ' - -- "The Last Ninety Days of the War in North Carolina " This is the title of a neat volume of 267 pages, by Cornelia Philips Spencer, an accomplished daughter of the Old North State, which we have received from the publishers, E. J. Hale & Son of New York. It gives an inter esting account of Sherman's march through the State, incidents of the war. &c. Orders for the book may be sent to E. J. Hale & Son, (late Editors of the Fayettevillo Observer.) wholesale Booksellers aud Stationers, 4Ub Broadway. New York. The price of a single copy, by mail free of postage, $1.50. To dealers, very liberal dis counts. Rather too" much space in the book is occupied in "putting a lew individuals anu particular families; and its statements are not altogether accurate, but the errors are not of much impor tance. For instance on page 109 we read: "Governor Graham was sent from the Legisla ture by a majority of three-fourths to the Confed erate Senate, in December, 1863, on the resigna tion of the Hon. George Davis, who had accepted the appointment of Attorney General in the Cab inet of President Davis. The Hon. Geo. Davis never resigned his place in the Confederate Senate. Governor Graham's friends went to work to defeat Mr Davis' re elec tion, and succeeded in electing Mr Graham. After this. President Davis invited Geo. Davis to a seat in his Cabinet. This is a matter of no im portance, only it is right to keep history correct. ! Too 

MUCH Labor. New York and Wash ington papers suy that there are thousands of laborers in those cities out of employment, and the prospect for them this winter is gloomy. If those people would come out this way, and go to cultivating the land, they might make a good living. Our land holders ought to agree on some plan for disposing of their lauds in small tracts, so as to induce immigration. " Hon. Ilerschel V.

Divested of petty technicalities, quirks and quibbles, it i3thus apparent that three-fourths of 1 1 O A . Jl me oiaies now represented in congress are com petent to make the pending constitutional amend ment part and parcel of the Constitution, the su preme law alike to the outside and the inside States and Territories. This is the conclusion which, we understand, will be acted upon by Con gress. Y lien three-fourths, or twenty-one of the twentv:six States now represented in Congress shall have ratified the amendment the Secretary of State will be required, by an act of Congress, if necessary, to proclaim the ratification complete. Then, while the ratification may be held as the condition of Southern restoration, the amendment consummated will still be binding upon thctn as the supreme law of the land, and Congress may enforce it from Virginia to Texas by "appropriate legislation, as in the lerritdnes. This is the solution which awaits the excluded States. It is a solution perfectly consistent with the rights and powers assumed by the loyal States in suppressing the rebellion of the late so-called Confederate States, and with all the legislation of Congress since the first bombardment of Fort Sumter."
