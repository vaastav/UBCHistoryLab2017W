SUSPECT GREEK GIFTS IN SENATE President's Friends Look Askance Upon Sudden Conversions to Bate Reform. EASY TO CHANGE THE EFFECT OF MEASURE Senators Will Be Watched Closely Lest Trick Make Rate Bill Worthless. By W. W. Jermane. "Washington, Dec. 7.The belief, which is gaming ground daily, that the railroad opposition to the president's program has in large pait subsided, and that some of the railroad senators may even support the administration bill, has started a good manv people in Washington to talking about the Greeks bearing gifts. Already it is being said that these men, former opponents of the administration policy, should be watched closely. It is an old trick in legislation to have alleged friends of a particular bill nullifv its provisions bv some slight amendment, sometimes of one word, a preposition, a coniunction or an adiec tive. It is believed here by many that this is what the friends of the admin istration will have to guard against most carefully. People find it difficult to believe that men who so recently were openly and notoriously in opposi tion to the Roosevelt policy are now about to undergo a sincere change of heart. Alive to Situation. The friends of the administration in both houses are alive to the situation, and of course there will be nothing of this kind if it can be prevented. In the meantime, things are still look ing bright for the advocates of genuine rate legislation, and their talk is su premely optimistic. Obviously, there is likely to be a slight reaction, and in a week from now things may not look as good as they do today. But "suf ficient unto the day" is the evil, or the good, thereof. Every move thus far has strengthened the president and worked to the undo ing of his opponents, and this state of affairs cannot long continue without making^ genuine legislation certain. The introduction of the much-talked of Esch-Townsend* bill yesterday caused a flutter of excitement, everybody be ing anxious to see "just what its pro visions were. It is apparent how ever, that Esh and Townsend will not occupy in this congress the favored po sition they occupi^rl in the last. Then they were practically the only friends the president had, and in a session which he expressely said was to be a session of talk, they achieved a good deal of fame. Session of Action. The present session is to be a session of action, according to the president's belief, and at its beginning he finds a number of the leading men in both houses anxious to stand, on the ground which he stands on. As between all these friends, he of course could not afford to select one or two as admin istration champions, discarding all others. Therefore, there will be no ad ministration bill this session, plainlv tagged as sueh, as was the case with the Esch-Townsend bill of a vear ago. The house committee on interstate and foreign commerce will itself pick out a bill that will be reported to the house, and that bill will be the admin istration bill. The Esch-Townsend bill will probablv not find favor in that committee, but some other bill will probably be_ reported for passage bv the house, either the bill drawn by the interstate commerce commission, at the Teouest of Senator Elkins, or some bill drawn along similar lines, perhaps the bill whieh Chairman Hepburn of that committpe is now writing. The argument in favor of some such a bill as this, which will re-enact the major portion of the present interstate commerce act, witho onlv such as are necessar convo thadditions princi ple which the president is fighting for, was outlined in these dispatches last Sunday morning in an interview with Bepresentative Steenerson of Minne sota. Waiting on Speaker, As soon as Speaker Cannon an nounces the committee on interstate and foreign commerce for this congress, that committee will meet and take ^t* the rate question, with a view to re porting a bill at as earlv a date as pos sible. Mr. Hepburn will continue to be chairman of that committee, and Mr. Stevens of Minnesota will be a member of it, as he was" in the last congress. There is good ground for the statement that Mr. Fletcher of Min nesota will not be able to regain a place on this committee. The speaker would give him a place on the nulitarv committee, provided Mi. Stevens would retire from that committee, but this Mr. Stevens is disinclined to do, owiner to the fact that the committee will have before it this session several im portant questions left over from the last congress, with which Mr. Stevens is familiar, and for the discussion of which his presence on the committee is highly important.

St. Petersburg, Dec. 6, Wednesday Night, via E\dtkuhnen, East Prussia, Dec. 7.Public confidence in the gov ernment's ability to weather the grow ing storm is waning fasff. Premier Witte seems powerless to cope with the new elements of danger which the revo lution is raising on every hand. New mutinies among the troops are con stantly reported, and the lawlessness in the country is increasing. Sakharoff Is Slain. St. Petersburg, Dec. 5, via Eydt kuhnen, East Prussia, Dec. 6.Lieu- tenant General Sakharoff, former min ister of war, was assassinated today. The government had deputed Gen eral Sakharoff to visit the province of Saratoff for the purpose uf quelling the agrarian riots there. A woman belonging to the so-called "flying columns" of the revolutionary movement called at the house of the governor of Saratoff at noon and asked to see General Sakharoff. She fired three revolver shots at the geneial, killing him on the spot. The tidings reached St. Petersburg tonight. Count Wjtte charged Lieu tenant General Rudiger, minister of war, with the task of breaking tho news to Madame Sakharoff. The event has created i profound impression in St. Petersburg, owing to fears that the 1 e\ olutioni3ts here will follow the example thus pet. Horrible Cruelties. The news of the assassination was preceded by the most horrible stories of the manner in which Sakharoff had been repressing the agraiian disorders. He corralled peasants with Cossacks and then had them beaten with the soldiers' whips. In so doing Sakharoff pursued the system adopted by Prince John Obolensky, former governor gen eral of Finland, in suppressing the agrarians in the vicinity of Kharkoff several years ago, when the prince caused the peasants to be whipped by relays of Cossacks and compelled them in turn to beat their comrades. The assassin of Sakharoff has not been identified. When arrested the woman who committed the crime de clared that she had executed a decree of the terrorists' section of the social revolutionists. How Sakharoff Came. 4^1 The following /is a description of Sakharoff:'s arrival at Hovoanschina, one of the villages of the province of Saratoff: "He came with Cossacks and artil lery. The peasants were surrounded by Cossacks and Sakharoff addressed. them, demanding that they surrender thpir leaders. The village elder replied but gave the general no information. The elder was immediately beaten until he lost consciousness. "Sakharoff then retired to the court house, leaving the peasants at the mer cies of the Cossacks, most of whom were diunk, and they began torturi'itfg the peasants, pulling out their hair and beards, and even tearing pieces of flesh from their faces. Thirty-three peas ants weie thus maltreated." Mutiny at Odessa. It is rumored that the military engi neers at Odessa are mutinously inclined. Prices on the bourse today were very weak. The offers, however, were o" a limited scale, but there was a complete absence of bujr ers Revolt in Capital. London, Dec. 7.The correspondent of the Times at St. Petersburg says: I am informed on excellent author ity that a revolt of the St. Petersburg garrison is ceitam to occur." The Daily Telegraph correspondent says: The specter of a military dictator ship which has been looming on the hor izon is slowly gaimug consistency and sharpness of outline. I am personally convinced that Count Witte's faith in the good sense and political tact of the Russian think ing classes, which recently was as firm as a rock, is gradually weakening, and with it his hopes tor the carrying out of the liberties promised in the emperor's manifesto. "There are signs of a collapse of the post and telegraph strike. Two thirds of the telegraph operators are daily of fering to resume work but they are pre \ented from so doing because the wires have been cut or the stations fail to answer signals.

Thirteen unions of civil engineers, law yers, teachers, physicians, clerks, etc., have foimed a Polish league of leagues as an annex of the Russian League of Leagues. The local police have petitioned the chief of police for better pay, housing and treatment. They require a favor able answer during the week, otherwise they threaten to strike. Advices from Odessa, Kieff, Rostoff and Kharkoff say that many merchants of these cities are finding it impossible to transact business ard are sacrificing their intei ests and leaving the countrv. REDS SWEEP RUSSIA TO ABYSS OF CHAOS WITTE POWERLESS SAKHAROFF SLAIN Telegraphers Hold Out. Moscow, Wednesday, Dec. 6, via Eydtkuhnen, East Prussia, Dec. 7.The elaborate measures taken by the police and militaiy for the protection of men who are willing to return to work have failed to induce any of the striking telegraphers to *resume their employ ment. A meeting of 2,000 strikers to day unanimously pronounced against yielding. The Finnish delegates de clared that all the telegraphers of Fin land were ready to enter the union and support the strike. Three hundred stiikers have already been dismissed under the decree of Interior Minister Durnovo. REFUGEES TELL OF HOBRORS Rich, Reduced to Beggary, Among Those Fleeing in Terror.

WILL OPEN ROAD TO RECIPROCITY Congress Likely to Pass Minimum and Maximum Tariff Law This Session. Journal Bpeoial Service. Washington, Dec. 7.Reciprocity by means of a maximum and minimum tar iff, on the basis of the suggestion made in the president's message, is likely to be the most notable piece of legisla tion by the fifty-ninth congress, not even excepting the railway-rate law, which is expected to be on the statute books before the end of this session. President Roosevelt did not expatiate on the desirability of the maximum and minimum tariff in his message, because, it is said, he had received assurances from the leaders of both houses that they favored the idea. Our foreign relations are involved to such an extent that it was not deemed wise to call general attention to this subject thru the medium of an extended discussion in his word to congress. Yet Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, the acknowledged spokesman of the ad ministration, introduced a maximum and minimum tariff bill in the senate. At the same time, it is said, his col leagues almost suiely will adopt a sim ilar bill and urge its passage. There is a vast significance in these two statements, for if such a, bill is passed, direct reciprocity with^any na tion will be immediately possible, and the great American commonwealth will have in its' hands alreadv fashioned a club with which to beat down the com mercial hostility of Germany and other nations. $3,750,000
