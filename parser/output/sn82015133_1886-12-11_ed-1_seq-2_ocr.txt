Hamilton, mounted inspector ot customs. Both men are well known hero and highly respected. In the ab sence of a knowledge o the facts, it cau only be surmised that the deplorable af fair was tbe outgrowth of some official misunderstanding and hot temper, as both gentlemen wero usually cool-headed, nffablo and intelligent. After tbe shooting, Mr. Hamilton surrendered himielfat onco to the authorities and undoubtedly believes himself justified iu tha net by tbe circumstances. Judge W. M. Lovell has gone to Nogales to take an ante-mortem statement ot the wounded man. the particulars. From a gontloman who came in to day from Nogales, the following panic ulars are learned: Tho tragedy occurred between three and four o'olock Tuesday nf temoon, in the offioe of the deputy collector ot cus toms. Mr. Kalhnr went over to the of fice to pay some duties on freights, as he was accustomed to do, and met Mr Hamilton there. Mr. Hamilton said to him: "Mr. Kalbar, I hear yon have been talking pretty rough about me." Mr. Kalhar replied, "lr what 1 hear you have said about me is not so, I take it all back and beg your pardon. But if what I have heard yon said about me is so, then it all goes." This was said in a pleasant and conciliatory manner. Hamilton at once jumped for bim and struck bim, knocking him down. As he arose, Hamilton pulled bis pistol and hot bim, tho bill passing though the lower part of one lung and the spleen going completely through the body. Collector Wilson caught hold ot Hamilton, another person who waa pres ent aasietiig him, and disarmed the murderer. Hamilton struggled to freo himself, saying, "-Let me go;lotinBshoit tbes otabh through tho head and end him right here." Tbo excitement ran very high in No gales, and the murderer would have been at onco lynched had not Mr. Kal har roused himself up enough to beg them to resort to no violence. Dr. Boss says that although the wounded man is resting quite comforta bly for ore in bis eircumstances, the chances are only one in a thousand that be will survive tbe wound, iie has youth, strength and a good constitution in his favor, however, and may possibly pull through Robert Fitzsininions Burned to Death. il'benix Herald .

Mr. Thos. Sherman and others mado a search, but fonnd nothing to confirm the 6Upicion. The coutinned absence of the man on Sun day morning, howtver, and tbo fact that bo bad been seen at tbo fire in an me briated condition and was two or three times led away from tho burning liquor store where be seemed nnxions to get hold ot a bnttlo ot liquor, led to thorough senrch and resulted in finding tbe remains ot a man in n corner of cellar of the burned buildiog.

Citizen: Mass meetings and nominating convention?, although fre quently improperly manipulated, serve to a great extent, tho purpose for which they were originally intended, that ot affording all olassea an opportunity to participate in the selection of public servants. Still, it seems that this time honored custom of making such selec tion is giving way to a singular innova tion, or the nnnonncement of numerous candidates who desire to catch votes by seir-adminng announcements. When conventions are not called, it is doubtless proper that citizens who have vested interests in our city should tes tify their willingness to serve its resi dents. But however well such an nouncements may bo received when they arc printed over the eignatures of tazyayersand businessmen, they seem shameless and rfdioulous when tney emanate from men who seek to become candidates without owning a dollar's worth of real estate in tbe city or coun ty. Such aspirants could not obtain the endorsement ot a publio meeting, and tbey should not receive eveu a com plimentary vote from the people.

When cocaine was discovered the medi cal world exclaimed "thank heaven 1" But useful as it is, it is also dangerous, especially when its use is perverted from the deadening of pain for surgical opera tions to the stimulation and destruction of tho human body. Its first effects are soothing and captivating, but the thrall dom is the most horrible slavery known to liumanitv. J. L. Stephens, 11. D.f of Lebanon, O., -was interviewed by our reporter yester day at the Grand Hotel, and during the conversation the doctor said : "The co caine habit is a, thousand times worse than the morphine and opium habits, and you would bo astonished," be said, "if you kuew how frightfully the habit is increasing." "What are iU effects?" "It is the worst constitution wrecker ever known. It ruins tbe liver and kid neys in half a year, and when this work is dono the strongest constitution soon succumbs." "Do you know of Dr. Underbill's case here in Cincinnati?" "That leading physician who became a. victim of tho cocaine habit? Yes. His cae was 11 very sad one, but the habit can be cured. I have rescued nianv a man from a worse condition." "What, worse than Dr. Underbill's!" "Indeed, sir, far so. Justin M. Hall, A. M., M. D., president of the 'State Board of Health of Iowa, and a famed practitioner, and Alexander Neil, M. D.. professor of surgery in tho Columbus Medical College, and president of the Academv of Medicine, a man widely known, ltev. AV. P. Clancey, of Indian apolis, Ind., from personal experience in opium eating, etc., can tell you of the kind of success our form of treatment wins, and so ran H. C. Wilson, formerly of Cincinnati, who is now associated with me." "Would you mind letting our readers into tbo secret of your methods?" "Well, jowxz man, you snrely have a good bit of assurance to ask a man to give hU business away to tbe jmlilic; but I won't w holly bapoint you. I have treated over 2 i.iHX) patisnts. In common with manyeniinent fdiysicians, I for years made a ci-o s-tu ly ot the ef fects of the lia'i!s :i the t-ystem and the organs which th-v mmt severelv attack. Dr. Hall, Dr. Neil ami Mr. Wilson, whom I have mentioned, and hundreds of others equally as exirt, made many similar experiments oik their own behalf. We each fourHlth.; these drags worked most destructively in the kidneys and liver; in fact, finally destroyed them. It was then a; parent that no euro could be effected until those organs could be restored to health. We recently exhausted tbe en tire range of medical science, experi menting with all known remedies for these organs, and as the result of these closo investigations we all substatially agreed, through following different 'ines of inquiry, that the most reliable scien tific preparation was Warner's safe cure. This was the second point in the discov erv. The third was our own private form of treatment, which, of course, we do not divulgo to tho public. Every cat-e that wo havo treated first with Warner's safe cure, then with our own private treatment, and followed npagain with Warner's safe cure for a few week, has been successful. These habits can't be cured without using it, because the habit is nourished sustained and in the liver and kidneys. The habit can be kent up in moderation, however, if free ut be also made, at the same time, of that croat remedv." "Yes. it is a world famed and iuMlv celebrated specific. Like many other pbvsieians, I used to deride the claims - , r t .

Un tins account thousands of people die every vear of kidney disease unknowingly. Tbey have so-calied disorders of the bead, of the heart and lungs and stomach, and treat them in vain, for the real cause of their misery is deranged kidneys, and if thev were restored to health the other disorders would soon disappear." Dr. Stephens' experience, that can be confirmed by many thousands whom be has treated, adds onlv more emphasis ti tho exiHjrienco of manv hundreds of thousands all over the world, that the remedy he refers to is without anv doubt 'the most leneficeiit discovery ever given to humanity.
