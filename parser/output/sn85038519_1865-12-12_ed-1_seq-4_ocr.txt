"Antelope" contributes the following, over his own signature, from " Kye," to the Hume Wcclly, Philadelphia, It will no doubt interest all of our agricultural read ers : 

ABOUT CHANGING SEED. Itii suqirising to mchow nny man can advocate or even countenance the planting or sowing of the same seed year after year, yet such a course ha found supporters in the iforne II Vri-ty, and perhaps their peculiar theories have found believers green ones, I should say. I flatter myself that I have done some farming, and watched its progress in all its various branches with great interest, but I must confess that a use of the samo seed, whether of tho potato, wheat, rye, com, oats, etc elc for a period of over three years, is just about the met backward style of farm ing mat l can conceive oi. W here I could get the other seoit l woutu not use what 1 had for more than two years ; in other words, 1 would change potatoes anil all rrains cverv two vears, satisfied that by so doitiK 1 would have an increased yield of from thirty to ntty per cent, in ine pro duction. The planting of the same potatoyear after vcar cannot be continued without a final giv ing out of the crop altogether (unless it be a crop of marbles.) and tho repeated sowing of wheat and other grain will invariably be followed bv a like result. It is so in the an imal kingdom, and why not in tho vegetable as well? What sane man that wished to improve the breed, size and health of his farm stock would think of breeding in and iniwrevmr? Some, manv I fear, do it. but they should hide their heads for very shame. To obtain a succession of fine potatoes, I , ft Ml . get new seed as oiion aapossuuc; 10 secure large corn, I select the biggest ears and shell off (by hand) only the largest kernals, avoid ing ilTw nt loth ends: to have heavv wheat or rye, I not only get new seed, but 1 tuft it by hand, removing all the foul sulistanccj, small and broken grains, and leaving onlv large and plump seed, the weight of which usually to several pounds over thcsUindard; to secure handsome, thriving poultry, I get fresh strong roosters, and set only the largest eggs I can find ; to keep my sheep vigorous and healthy,.a new and improved buck is introduced to their acquaintance every sec ond or third vcar, and so on, I might go all through tho catalogue of farm life. Such is inr man, as tlic President would say ; if any object and prefer to breed in. or plant and sow over and over all their life time, thev are icrfeetlv welcome to do SO. onlv I hope they will never have the as surance to claim that they aro "Progressive rarmcrs,' 31 r. ScwanVn Account of tlic Attack Ifjpon 211m. The American correspondent of the Lon don Spectator, contains the following account of a conversation with Secretary Seward, and Mr. Frederick Seward, giving a des cription of their sensations at the time of the attempted assassination: " Mr. Frederick Seward said, that on step ping from his bedroom into the plssage, and seeing the assassin, he merely wondered what he was doing there, and called him to ac count. On his resisting the fellow's endeavor to press into Mr. Seward's room, the assas sin drew a revolver, which he presented at Mr. Frederick Seward's head. What fol lowed, it must be remembered, took placo in a few seconds. Mr. Frederick Seward's first thought was, 'That's a navy revolver.' The man nulled the trigger, but it only snapped, anct his intended victim thought, ' That cap missed fire.' "His next sensation was that of confusion, and being upon the floor, resting upon his arm, which, like his father's jaw, was barely recovered from a bad fracture the assassin had felled him to the floor with the but of the pistol he put his hand to his head, and finding a hole there, he thought, 'That cap did not miss fire after all. "Then he became icscnsible,and remained so for two days or more, nis first indica tion of returning consciousness was the ques tion, "Have you not got the ball out?" after which he fell ofi'again into a comatose condition, which was of long continuance. On the very aficrnoon of the day when Mr. Lincoln was assassinated, Mr. Frederick Seward, who was Arshtant Secretary of State, had asked his father what prepara tion should le made for the presentation of Sir Frederick Rruce, which wa3 to take place the next day. Mr. Seward gave him the points of a reply to be made to Sir Fred erick, and he laid the outline of the speech upon the President's table, and, as I have previously informed my readers, Mr. Lincoln that afternoon wrote out the reply, adopting Mr. Seward's suggestion", and thus preparing the reception of the Itritish Minister by President Johnson, which was regarded at the time by the people to whose representa tive it was addressed as so friendly and fair, and dignified. "Mr. Frederick Seward's first inquiry after he came fully to his senses, which w.n a long time after the assassination, was: 'Has Sir Frederick Rruce been presented?" He thought that only one night had passed since he knew not what had happened to him, and his mind took up matters just where it had left them. " Mr. Seward's mental experience during his supposed assassination was in its nature so like that of his son, that it raises the question whether this absence of consterna tion and observation of minute particulars is not common in circumstances of unex pected and not fullyapprchended peril. Mr. Seward was lying upon his side, close to the edge of his bed, with his head resting in a frame, which had been made to give him ca'c and protect his broken jaw from pres sure. "He was trying to keep awake, having been seized upon by a sick man's fancy it was that if he slept he would -wake up with lockjaw. He was brought to full conscious ness by the scufllc in the passage way, fol lowed by the entrance of the assassin, and the crv of Miss Seward, 'Oh I he will kill my father.' Hut he saw nothing of his as sailant until a hand appeared above his face, and then his thought was, 'What handsome cloth that overcoat is made of.' The assas sin's face then appeared, and the helpless statesman only thought, 'What a handsome man 1' (Payne wa3 a fine looking fellow.) "Then came a sensation as of rain strik ing him smartly upon one side of his face and neck, then quickly the same upon the other side, but he felt no severe pain. This was the assassin's knife. The blood spouted, be thought 'My time has come,' and falling from the bed to the floor, fainted. His first sensation of returning consciousness was that he was drinking tea, and 'that it tasted good.' Mrs. Seward was giving him tea with a spoon. He heard low voices around him, asking and replying as to whether it would be possible for him to recover. He could not speak, but his eves showed his conscious ness, and that lie desired to speak. They brought him a porcelain tablet, on which he managed to write, "Give me some more tea. I shall get well.' And from that moment he has slowly but steadily recovered health and strength." Freak of Fortune. A lady of this city, of the highest respectability and afilucucc before the war, by one of the vicissitudes of Dame Fortune became separated from her husband during the early days of the Con federacy. For years she had heard nothing of him, and at lat the melancholy conclu sion was accepted that he was dead. In the meantime she became reduced in circum stances, and at the time when the Federal troops occupied the city she was compelled to dispose of her costly and elegant furni ture. This she did, piece by piece, until the last object which served to" bind her to her former independence had been sent, and she began to despair. Only a few days ago she received a letter from a gentleman residing in Mississippi, in which she was informed that her husband had lately died, leaving a fortune of over sixty thousand dollars, of which she was the only heir. A check for one thousand dollars accompanied the letter for her immediate wants, and she immedi ately took her departure for the place where her unexpected fortune awaited her. It ap pears that her husband, having enlisted in the army was discharged on account of ill ness, and owing to the unscitlcd state of the country, preferred to remain in the extreme South until the close of the war. While there he became engaged in various specula tions, and made large amounts of money, in tending to rejoin his family as soon as peace was declared. He invested his funds in cot ton, and had just disposed of it when death closed his career. He had written many let ters to his wife, but, strange to say, none of them reached her ; the above letter being the first information she had been able to obtain as to his fate.
