The first move in the preparation of the inaugural reception, the 7th of Dext month, was made Saturday at a meeting of the statehouse officials and employes to appoint committees for decoration and other arrange ments preliminary to carrying out a program. Nothing was done at the Washing ton meeting of the governors of a dozen states and several members of congress in behalf of the reorganiza tion of the republican party. The belief prevailed that it was too early, although the advocates of reorganiz ation were of the opinion that a na tional convention should, be held in 1913 for that purpose.

That ships will be going through the Panama canal by next fall is the prediction of President Taft in his last message to congress. This will mean that the big ditch will be open ed to commerce a full year before the date Bet Colonel Roosevelt, in his address to the bull moose conference on Tuesday clearly indicated his intention of keep ing the new third party alive, if it in power to do so. The evident belief of some of the colonel's followers, in some states, that the third party movement was merely a campaign affair, and not designed for permanency, is evidently not shared by the colonel himself. It will be interesting to watch the course pursued by those followers of the col one who maintain, and no doubt honest ly believe, that they are still repabli cans, if the colonel persists in the course of action laid down in his speech at Chicago. It does not appear to the Sioax Falls Argus-Leader that the dumping in to a gravel pit near Elgin of a thousand car loads of potatoes was justfiiable when so many people are suffering for food. The potatoes were thrown away because the price was too low to warrant their transporta tion to market. The associated charities of Chicago is able to show that 18,000 poor Chicago families are in need of from 100,000 to 150,000 busbeis of potatoes and have not tbp money with which to purchase them It is stated that potatoes are low on account of overproduction, bnt the Sioux Falls paper sanely concludes bat there Is no overproduction when pewple are starving because they can of several years ago. There is no brighter page in American busi ness history than that which tells of the construction of the Panama canal which has been carried to completion without a dollar of graft. 

ROADS MAY LINK STATE CAPITALS At the coming session of Congress, Congressman Stanton Warburton of Tapoma, Wash., will introduce a bill which provides for the creation of a national military highway. It is in tended that this roadway will connect the capitol of every state in the Union with the nations' capitol. The bill will provide for a sixteen foot roadway, with heavy concrete base and hard surface, such as asphalt or vitrified brick so as to make the roads as nearly as possible dustless. The expense is estimated at from $20,000 to $25,000 a mile. How Fund Can Be Raised In order to raise the large sum that will be required, Congressman War burton proposes to restore the inter nal revenue tax of 1870 on tobacco and to set aside the additional income from this source as a national road fund. The additional tax so provid ed, he estimates, would amount to eilghty million dollars a year, and with this fund at the disposal of the government he believes the contem plated 15,000 miles of roadway could be built and paid for withiu five years. The bill will also provide for the use of lj^per cent of this income for the construction of like roads in the national parks, 8200,000 a year to be spent for each park for a period of five rears. "The proposed scheme of roads," says Mr. Warburton, "is a most im portant one from every point of view. It is not necessary to state the ad vantages of such a system they will appeal to every one. I cannot ima gine opposition to the proposed law from any source, as it seems to me there will be a universal demaud for it by the people when they are ad vised how easy it is to acquire the roads, and how little the public at large will feel the tax." CONDITION OF STATE BANKS Mitchell.—From the advance sheets of the forthcoming report of Public Examiner Wingfield, the condition of of tbe state banks is shown to be vast ly improved over that made in the June report, and a comparison ef the same makes a fine showing for the banks The report is made under the September call of the national banks, and at that date the undivided profits amounted to $2,194,568.10, with $1, 846,179.78 for June. The total deposits for September are 851,962,823-13, while in June they were $46,934,793.61, mak ing an increase of $4,000,000. The re serve on cash for September was $17, 393,046.66 and for June it was $14,528, 313.17, due largely to the checking ac counts. T„he increase of the reserve is 2% per cent over the former state ment issued. The checking accounts also indicate a fine increase, with] the September report showing $21,950,636. 09, and the June reports amounting to '18,966,940.85. Public Examiner Wingfield expects to send out the complete report of the state and national banks in the course of two or three weeks. The financial con dition in the state is much improved over a year ago, and with the results of the big crop to be heary from later in the season South Dakota's outlook could not well be improved upon. i' 5a NEW FARM PROJECT IN HILLS H. M. Bertleson and J. H. Hersarin are brothers-in-law and until recently were business men at Sabula and Clin ton, Io., respectively. Now they are South Dakota ranchmen, owning 2,600 acres of land on the Box Elder divide which was formerly known as the J. VV. Potter, and the Philips and Hafter ranches. J. E. Dilgor sold the land to the Io wans a little more, than a year ago for 545,000, but it was not until this fall that they determined to go in for wheat raising on a large scale. Mr. Bertleson will try tilling' meth ods and Mr. Hersam will experiment with subsoiling. To assist in their work there has been unloaded in the Northwestern yards within the last two days $10,000 worth of farm machin ery of various kinds, including a trac tion engine, deep tillers, seeders, disc plows cultivators and many other farm implements. The owners are goiug to work at once to break a large acreage They also contemplate raising a large amount of alfalfa. Cattle will also form one branch of their farm in dustry and with this end they now have apwards of 500 head running on the two places. Plans of the newcomers include sev eral new buildings and the exclusive remodeling of the buildings now on the two raaefcuo.—Bapid City Journal. SOUTH DAKOTA LAYS CLAIM TO FARM CROP EXCELLENCE Potatoes and Corn in Particular Praised as World's Finest Quality Everything Good for Human or Stock Food Shown in Perfection Corn, so red it is almost black, scar let, orange, yellow and white, blazes forth the name of South Dakota on the booth of that state at the North western Products exposition, and corn is the product of which samples have been brought from practically every county in that state of many climatic variations. The decorations were done by Harry Carney, who for years has covered the walls of the corn palace at Mitchell with fantastic designs wrought in care and kernels of different colors, Chief in space occupied and atten tion attracted within the booth is the display of the South Dakota Potato association. Only one variety is shown, early Ohios, which have been found, according to the growers, to be peculiarly adapted to the soil con ditions of that state, and which have brought to South Dakota the title of "The Land of the Great Big Baked Potato." Among the exhibitors is 1. D. Fulker, who in 1911, known as a drouth year, sold $1,800 worth qf po tatoes from bis Brown county ¥arm. Can Feed Whole Country "Oat state when all the land is tak en up and proper crop rotation is ob served, can raise enough potatoes to feed the entire Unitfed States," said Mr. Hume. "That sounds pretty strong, but I believe it to be a fact, for you can grow 400 bushels to the acre with eight and a half inches of rain. Potatoes are heavy in starch and that is just made up of sunshine and water, and who has more of that than we have? South Dakota farm ers can raise potatoes as cheaply as anyone in the Country and cheaper than most." Mr, Hume thinks South Dakota ii not appreciated by people who have not traveled over its prairies and through its Black Hills. He indicat ed the dozen varieties of corn, more than that many kiuds of wheat, 25 kinds of wild grasses growing on its level stretches, and fruits and vege tables of large size and great variety brought from valleys in the Hills. Farmers Earn $120,000,000 "All outsiders bear of South Dako ta, beside descriptions of its big. prai ries," he declared, is about the amount of gold and silver they mine out in the IIllls. That amounts to $8,000,000 a year, yet the farmers of the state raise grain and hay 15 times greater in value. They grow all the necessities of life all the grains for fiour and meal, potatoes and beef, and every year sees more farmers adding dairies." STATE DEBT ON THE SLUMP The department of history has an nually for the past four years made a statement of the debt of the state on the 12th of November, and the figures for the four years show: 1909 $1,083,472.18 1910 1,578,515.00 1911.... 873,864.00 1912 575,771.07 RICHARDS' LAW FACTS There is no change in the popular election of party state committeemen between the old and the new party law. The change is merely in method of proposal.- The old method by peti tion is preserved. The additional method by representative committee is not compulsory. The change af fects the proposal of candidates for nomination to public office as well as to party office equally. The connty auditor has new duties to perform under the new law as well as the state committeeman. Both have their elec tion certificates for a term of two years. Both have their election cer tificates for a term of two years. One received bis election certificate from the county canvassing board of tbe primary election, tbe other from the connty canvassing board of tbe genr eral election. One is a party officer, the other a public officer. Tbere is nothing in tbe new party law wbieb legislates anybody ont of office. Ev erybody wbo voted at tbe last primary election are enrolled party electors. The coanty auditor has tbe enroll ment books preserved from last pri mary election. NO. 32 PARMLEY HEADS REPUBLICANS The attendai ce at the committee meetings of tbe two leading parties for enforcement of political appoint ments under the new primary law, held in this city, did not show up largely in numbers, thejapplicants for place being as numerous, or more so, than the committeemen.

Bennett of Hughes, George JB. For-* ter of Lawrence, D. D. Prlntup of Marshall, Harry Loveland ofStanley, and.Frank Goddard of Sully. J.'W. Parmley was selected chair man and C. H.

Arrests May Follow Huron, Dec. 10.—According to ru mors current on tbe street here, war rants are to be sworn out for tbe ar rest of Chairman James P. Coffey of the Democratic state central commit tee, ajod for Chairman Carl G.

BURKE HARD AT WORK Washington, D, C., Dec. {.—Repre sentativeCharles H. Burk#, of Pierre, is in better shape pbysicAlly than be has been for many years. The report that be was suffering with Bright'* disease was untrue and Mr, Burke says he does not know how sucb a story ever started. During tbe last summer he was operated on for gall bladder trouble and he bad his ap pendix removed. These operations restored his health and he now is working every day at bis duties as a member of tbe subcommittee on In Indian affairs. MR. BRYAN'S PLATFORM Sioux City Journal: Mr. Bryan is somewhat disturbed in his mind, ac cepting tbe evidence of his Common er. "Eternal vigilance is tbe price of popular government," is the slogan of the hour and Mr. Bryan is clear in his thought on tbe point of what constitutes popular government. Mr. Bryan for himself js in Piorida en joying the climate but be is in com munication. 'We have a democratic senate and a democratic house, as well as a democratic president," be says, "but let no one think it safe to goto sleep." The democratic ma jority in the senate is figured down to one, and "a few reactionaries may obstruct legislation or insist on con cessions as the price of support." Mr. Bryan does not delude himself, in tbe interest of harmony, with the thought that tbere are no democratic reaction aries in congress and tbere be may have suspicion that bere and tbere a reactionary may obtain advisory re lationship with tbe president. MLet no one think it safe to go to sleep." Mr. Bryan is sore tbat "it behooves every democrat to be on tbe alert «nd to wain his senators and his member of congress against any backward step.". Tbe Baltimore platform is tbe letter of the law. "Every offi cial," says Mr. Bryan, "should be held to tbe letter and spirit of tbe platform." Tbat is tbe point with Mr. Bryan, and be is positive "tbe officials at Washington should be tn-gj formed tbat tbe rank and file of tbiT democratic party insist* on the carry* lng out of tbe platform/' It is r*f' membered tbat during the eanjMiifii Mr. Wilson did not treat the platform as embracing everything in bis dem ocracy.
