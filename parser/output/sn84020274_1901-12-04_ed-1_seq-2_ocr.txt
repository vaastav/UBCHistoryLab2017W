"PresMent Rocevelt's expres'ons In la ter of maintaining the extravagant and un reasonable Dlngley tariff rat-s are a disap pointment to mp. I hoped he would be ! ddttlly more liberal In his iens on that question. As I ur.dertand the IredfntV expression, l.e favors leaving Cuba in Un hands of the Cubans, and I am pleased with this taienvnt. It I? an absolute compliance with the pledge of Congress to the world. I had been apprehensUe that the Repub lican party had ro such Intention. 1U statement that there Is no necessity for in creasing the standing army just now seem? to Imply that there may be In the future, and this I en sorry to s-e, although not surprised at the statement. "I do r.ot indorse the President's advo cacy of a much stronger navy. I bolieve there Is no need for It. This nation ha net. like Grpat Britain or Trance, set out upon a career as a war nation. Our aim Is peace. Justice and fellowship amons men. and I think it Is contrary to the Intention of this Government to embark upon a different course. "The President's expressions upon the trust question are about what one would expect from the class of Republican lead ers, who are dominant now and who do r.ot believe there should be any Interference with monopolies. The Intention clearly Is to maintain the most cordial relations be tween the Republican government and th trusts. This latest expression Is a disap pointment, because there Is certainly a very strong feeling In the country in favor ot positive restrictive action by Congress up on the trurts. As the House has passed an anil-trust bill. It was reasonable to hope that President Roosevelt would recommenl similar action at thls"esslcn by both the House and Senate. The President's ex pressions upon this issue lessen the chance for passing the anti-trust bill." 

PRESIDENT'S ATTITCrjE OS TRISTS DISAPPOINT! !kn TO COCIIRAX. Representative Charles F. Cochran of St. Joseph said: "In reference to the great questions be fore the people, the President stands en Republican ground. He thinks It would be a misfortune to have effective anti-trust legislation enacted and enforced. He thinks an assault on the trusts would be an assault on the business Interests: that they should be handled gingerly and with paternal affection. I did not expect to see so soon In a President's message what will henceforth constitute the citadel of trust domination in America; that Is, an asser tion that an assault on the trusts would disturb the business Interests cf the coun try. The stock and money markets will certainly suffer a shock when anti-trout legislation is earnestly entered upon. "If the banks and financial Interests of the country become entangled with unlaw ful combinations for the restraint of trade, they will go down with the wrertr . the time comes To annul now or here after the consolidation of Western railroads recently made by the Harrlman-HIII com bine would produce financial panic.

VAXDIVER RELIEVES IT WII.I, MISLEAD GREAT MAXY PEOPI.K. Representative Vandiver: "As a whole, the mesage Is a very plaus ible document, and will mislead a great many people. The President's comment on the labor question may make laboring men believe they are to have relief from the tyr anny of corporation employers; that their hours of labor will be reduced or their wages Increased, and that they have a friend In the White House; but wait until .some of that crystallizes in legislation, and the laboring man's eyes will open to his de lusion. "The President's paragraph on the trusts is a fine diplomatic straddle. He takes j aiv. t..,;3 .v ,.111.1... V Haft. J .lHSIUCr . good trust than he does to assail a bad one. Other parts of the message make a fine mixture of classical reference with sentences of the bluntest English of the Rough Rider. His advocacy of a g'reat na vy Is popular, and weft calculated to carry many people off their feet. His reference to a standing army will not be apt to great ly offend the public. On the whole, the message will probably be considered popu lar, aefpnc tne tact that it really pro poses r.o definite relief or settlement of any of the puzzling questions of the hour. 

JIDGE COOSEY FIDS IX IT CO.NSIDERABLE TO COMMESD. Judge Cooney: "It was evidently an object with the Pres ident to suppress In his- mesi-age any rank ness In expression or sentiment. It is a plain, well-written document on subjects now quite familiar. Both sides of every aubject is aiscussea legMation r.o'.lrd to overcome the evil ef f'Ctv of mnnc7K:i-tic untrol. The assertion of the r-onxlct.on that the Governmnt can oortrcl by law the encroachment of cap ital will be generally accepted, and Is hi I.ne w.;ii the vote of the Missouri Demo- 1 crats In the lat Congres-. "Taken as a whole the mesaep is ex- ire.t-td in pla'n terras and simple lan guage. It vindicates. In part, the Presi dent';, courag-, ard show a shrewdness which he was not supposed to pose. In a-olling Tx-elrlc recommendation on many qiie.nlons about which his party is now di vided In opinion." AS A WHOLE THE MESSAGE APPEALS TO SIIACKLEFORD. Representative Shackleford: "Taken as a whole thA message li a strong document, bristling with the Indlviduallty of its author. "I am p!cnsd with It vigorou assertion of the Monroe Doctrine ar.d fully agree with him as to it Importance, though I do not quite concur In his construction of It. "I aIo believe with him that we should strengthen our navy. To asert the Mon roe Doctrine and secure our own peace, we must be Strcnc- at S"a The Prrl 1r!t n.it. It In admirable phrase. 'We desire the peace which comes as of right to a Just man armed; not the p-ace granted on terms of ignominy to the craven and tha weakling.' "Hl statement that there Is no need of an Increase in our standlmr amr m , . mended. and it Is to be regretted that he did not recommend a reduction. No Invad ing army could "come against us which could not be easily repelled by a volunteer force called Into the field for that purpose. "S therefore need but a smalt o,- On the subject of trusts the message Is grievously disappointing. From previous utterances, the people had expected the Pres.dent to deal with monopolies in a vigorous manner, but he shows hlmslf to nave been suppressed by his party leaders. True, in general terms he discusses the evil.-, of trusts, hut he Insert? enough saving cause to assure the plutocrats that they have nothing ta fear. He says: The mechanism of modern business is so deli cate that extreme care must be taken not to.lnterfore In a. spirit of rashness and Ig norance.' which means that the questions will be handled very gently. The character of trust legislation which he does propose Is most unfortunate. It would virtually take away from th States all right to reg ulate and put the whole matter In the hands or the Federal courts, which would differ very little from putting It In the hands of the trusts themselves. The message gives but little room for hope for relief from tariff tyranny. The President discusses in a vague way our merchant marine, with out offering any definite plan for Its better ment. This gauzy generalization drives us to tne conclusion that he has surrendered the ship-subsidy looters." 

WITIIOCT STCDYI.XG MESSAGE JIDGE RCCKER IS IMPRESSED. Judge Rucker: "I have had no opportunity to study the President's message, but followed lu read ing, and am Impressed with the Idea that It Is a plausible, strong and able paper, freer from criticism than I expected. "It does not recommend tariff legislation as forcibly as I wasi led to hope, but I doubt If even the mild "suggestions It con tains will be followed. ' ' "It deals with the trusts very tenderly ond Is almost pathetic In Its admonitions of prudence In legislation on this subpect These admonitions will likely be heeded.' and no bills pissed to protect the people from the avarice and greed of combine". The Republican party dare not antagonize the money power, and the President i carefully avoided doing so In his message. "Referring to the Philippine problems the message outlIr.es a policy of rank Imperial ism, and says: 'As an earnest of what we Intend to do. we point to what we have done This declaration will fail to Inspire the Filipinos with Increased respect for this country as a liberty-loving, liberty giving nation, or give them hope or ulti mate freedom. "I am well pleased with those parts of the message which recommend the re-en-petment of the Chinese exclusion act and the enactment of a law which will make It ...iiu.:.-!tu,c mr an anarcnist to land on American soil." niTI.ER rilARAfTERIZES IT AS 

COXSERVATIVE OX TnE WHOLE. Representative J. J. Butler: "Stripped of Its verbiage and eulogv. it Is an otherwise able document. It is "rhe torically and classically suggestive of the litterateur. It Is analytic, but lacks bold ness. More fearlessness In suggesting reme dies for existing evils was looked for. "His treatment of the 'trusts' Is mildly homeopathic and entirely too soothing for quick result. He has touched but lightly on the money question, and in a manner not to seriously antagonize, at this time, any great element of the people. "HI Mews on immigration are clear and correct; on Chinese exclusion and Importa tion of foreign labor, prudent and sensible. "His conclusions on the questions of 'arid lands' and irrigation, the protection of the rorests ana streams or our land, are logical and Just, and deserve the support of both parties. "His Philippine policy Is that of bis party and Is unamerican. "His po'lt!on on the army and navy Is patriotic, and. In the main, correct. "His reassurlpg on the 'tariff question' : Illogical, and. while his theory that labor (when employed) Is better paid under the Republican system cf protection. may in some instances be correct, he entirely Ig nores the fact that the cost of living la doubly Increased thereby, and that a panic or wholesale failure in the agricultural or commercial world at any moment would plurge a large element or our wage-earners Into want and misery. "On the whole, the message Is conserva tive, gives no serious offense to any one. and, unlike similar documents or the past, makes pleasant reading." Mr. Robb: ROBB IS XOT PLEASED WITH RECOMWEXDATIOXS OX TRUSTS. "Without undertaking to comment on the President's message as a whole.

"Ir ever anarchy Is triumphant. Its triumph will last for but one red mo- ment, to be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night of despotism." "The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath Is once kindled It burns like a consuming flame." "This great country will not fall Into anarchy, but if anarchists should ever become a serious menace to its institutions, they would not merely be stamped out, but would involve in k j their own ruin every active or pa?- V j slve sympathizer with their doc- trines." "The men who are idle' or cred- ulous, the men who tek gains not by genuine work with head or hand, but by gambling in any form, are s always a source of menace, not only to themselves, but to others."

"The firs: esential In determining how to deal with the grat Industrial 4 combinations Is knowledge of the facts publicity."

"When all Is said and done, the rule of brotherhood remains as th? in- dispensable prerequisite to succe In the kind of national life for which we strive." "Reciprocity must be treated as the O handmaiden to protection." "It must not be forgotten that our rallwa-s are the arteries through which the commercial blood of th!- nation tlows." "Anarchy Is no more an expression of 'social discontent' than piiitlng si pockets or wife beating."

LLOYD ATTACKS REMARKS IX IlEFfcRESCE TO COMIMXATlOSS. Representative Lloyd: "The mettisc will be commended by- all In what It says of the moral character and personal worth or president McKInley. The forceful denunciation of the crime of an archy will be Indorsed by the true Ameri can. "The reference to trusts and monopolies and the remedies offered therefor win be a disappointment, for It is too apolosetic in Its character. The statement that th creation of great corporate fortunes Is not due to the tariff, nor any other government al action' will be a surprise, for'the people are aware that It has had much to do with their formation. The publication of the financial condition of corporations would be generally Indorsed, but K Is not the only afford some relief, but the Government should not enter Into the trust business. A 'trust' 1? now and always ha3"been an ille gal combination and the Government should not by any act legalize it. Anarch.sts strike at the Government, and anarchy Is an evil which we would prohibit and blot out for ever. The trust strikes at the liberties or the people; It is an evil recognized by all l.ut the trust beneficiaries; It forces the po rtle to enter the market where competition is restricted. If not destroyed entirely. The ! efforts of the national and State govern ments should be to prohibit trusts entirely, and I regret that the President did not rec ommend vigorous legislation along that line. I cannot believe that the message will give the trust: any great uneasiness. "I would infer that the President favors the ship subsidy. This will be a great dis appointment to the many who had been led to believe that he would not lend himself to this particular object of favoritism and class legislation." 

COWHERD SATS DEMOCRATS WILL St'PPORT 5IA.TV SCGGESTIOXS. Representative Cowherd: "The President's message will be a sur prise to those-who expected him to deviate from the usual path. It is, however, a of the Indian as an Individual, and a na tional exhibit at the C Louis Exposition. Xone of these are party questions and should not become sucn. "In the discission of the tariff li seems to me the message is more artful than frank. It advocates high tariff for the protection ist and reciprocity for the free-trader, leav ing each Individual case to stand on its own bottom. This is In line with Republi can policy. That party never framed a tariff bill on any other principle than a di vision of the spoils among the larget con tributors. "From his speeches, both during the cam paign and after, we had a right to expect a more vlgoroushandllng of the trust ques tion. The argument Is about equally .bal anced between necessity for action and the dangers that may follow It. A" a gentle man suggested, the President's discussion of the trusts did not seem to be marked by 'that lucidity of statement he shewed Ik the Oklahoma Incident.' " "On the subsidy bill the President is equally cautious. He favors the upbuildin? f the merchant marine, as does every one, but he refrains from indorsing Mr. Hanna's pet measure. "There Is rather more of sslf-gorernment for the Filipino and a friendlier feeling tow ards Cuba than we are accustomed to hear from such sources. "Taking It as a whole, there Is much In the message that will commend Itself to the business Interests, and there is likewise a strong- Indication that the President will take no decisive action along lines where there Is doubt of his party following him." 

DOUGHERTY CALLS MESSAGE VAGUE AXD DISAPrOI.VTIXG. "In treating of trusts and the tariff, the message Is somewhat vague and disappoint ing. The President's vigorous denunciation of trusts during the recent campaign and since, in public utterances, are not fully sustained by the- tenor of his message, and his former views on the tariff arc much rrcdlfleil in this latest expression. These are the subjects of great political significance, and in dealing with them he appears to have been most guarded. "I approve the views expressed on the 'question of the reclamation of arid public lands and. Incidentally, believe that th? construction of reservoirs at the headwa ters of the Missouri River would avoid th devastating June floods, which In year past have destroyed so many thousand acres of Missouri River bottom lands. I also In dorse the recommendation on the subject or the extension or fre rural mall delivery This branch of the postal service is of in calculable convenience and advantage to the farmers, and this fact is beginning to b fully appreciated by them." MR. 

BALL OF TEXAS SEES MAM' CHARMIMG POSSIBILITIES IS IT. Mr. Ball of Texas, who was the member of that State on the Platform Committee at the Kansas City convention, said: "The message Is strong In attractive com position, weak in specific recommendations: The dominant feature Is that It presents. In somewhat Utopian stvle, the most compre hensive system of paternalism ever present ed to Cojgress. From a beneficent regula tion of trusts, the education of labor to look with exrectant eyes to the humanity and liberality of Its employers, the reclamation and irrigation of and lands, tinder Impossi ble conditions, to the creation of forest re serves, where water may be Impounded, game preserved and 'free' camping grounds provided, where our people may find rest and health. In gradual gradation, the mes sage presents charming possibilities. "The treatment of the trust question Is weak and Ineffective, but shows that his party has not the courage to do, namely, reveals Its true attitude toward trusts. The President, as does his party, evidently looks upon these combinations, not as public ene mies to be suppressed, but as large enter prises to be encouraged by the National Government, mild regulation ar.d govern ment supervision being the only remedy he proposes. "The treatment of the Philippine question Is not satisfactory. Time alone can develop the success of the Republican proposition for a government like ours to dose out lo a people upon American territory -all tim liberty for which they are fitted.' I think he Is fairly right in saying 'there are still troubles ahead In the Islands.' " Philippines, which will be at JefTerson Bar racks on December 20. to take part. Wont Half Holiday Declared.

These letters have been flled with the Secretary, and will be referred to the Grand Marshal, which officer will be named at the net meeting of the committee. letters from cities and towns near St. Louis indicate that great Interest Is felt In the ground-breaking ceremonies, and that a number of parties would be made up to attend.
