PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.? President Cleveland's last annual nessage, the full text of which appears n our news columns, is just . such a date paper as was expected from him. t is a broad, comprehensive, conscrva . live, patriotic discussion of public ques- ions, and is in every particular charac -7 eristic of the man who wrote it. There s nothing to indicate that the sting of lefeat rankles in . his bosom. In. con- orming with the requirements of the oiistitution, ho makes .[such frecoin- nendations to congress as ; he. honestly •elieves to be essential to the pub- lie welfare, and proceeds to a dis cussion of leading issues just as i hough no election had occurred; >r that it had resulted: in a popular yin- dication of the policy he had heretofore pursued. He is as true to principle in the hour of defeat as be was in the hour if victory. The only fault to find with the message is one too common. with state papers— its length. By good edit- ing it might have been cut down to half the space it occupies without destroy- ing any of the meat. — m> 

STEAM-HEATING FRANCHISE. STEAM-HEATING FRANCHISE. At its meeting to-night the council will probably act upon the petition for a steam-heating franchise, which has been favorably recommended by the commit- tee to whom it was referred. The Globe publishes this morning inter- views with a number of prominent citi- zens, who have been asked to express their opinions on this matter. Some are disposed to look upon it with favor. some arc decidedly opposed to it, while others either have not looked into the matter or are indifferent about it. The Globe has heretofore expressed its opinion that the city government- should be exceedingly cautious in granting franchises of any character, and more especially when they include a monopoly. We find no reason in this instance to change that opinion, nor can we see why this application should be made an exception. We have be- fore our eyes to-day too many cvi- dences of the folly of indiscriminately granting exclusive franchises. The city has been too much the victim of its own generosity in the past ever to be guilty of the same fault in the future. We have reached that stage of metro- politan growth when we are compelled, in self-defense, to be watchlttl of the Greeks who come into our midst bear- ing gifts. So far as this steam-heating franchise that is asked for is concerned, it may be comparatively harmless. But at best it is setting a bad prece- dent to grant the applicants an exclu sive franchise. And yet we do not know but that this steam-heating pipe line? if put into operation, may work a great deal of harm. The fact is, we don't know anything about it, because it is yet an experiment, and, as one gentle- man says in his interview, St. Paul is the last city on the continent, to select as an experimental city for a new heating process. Our winters are too long and severe to take any risks. But it is not against the parties who are making application for this franchise, nor against the scheme, that our argu ment is directed. We are simply tak- ing the position that, as a matter of principle, it is wrong for the city government to grant an exclusive fran chise, unless it is for something that is absolutely necessary to the prosperity of the city and can not be obtained in any other way. And even then the common council should go slow and protect the city's interests in every way that is possible to protect them. Coming, as this application does, be- fore a council that was elected on a re- form platform, we take it for granted that the body will act wifely in its dis posal of this application, and will keep the interests of the city well in view. _^ SENATOR ALLISON. SENATOR ALLISON. The impression has gotten abroad that Senator Allison is to occupy a place in the Hakiuson cabinet, and it is asserted on good authority that he has already been booked for the next secretary of the treasury. If this be true, it exhibits more political sagacity on the part of the president-elect than he has heretofore been given credit for possessing. . Taking everything into consideration, Senator Allison is by all odds the foremost man in his party to- day. They may talk about Blame's brilliancy and magnetism, or Sher man's conservative statesmanship, but it was Allison's cool brain and level head that won the victory for the Re publican party in the late presidential contest. He won the fight by dig-* ging the party out of the mire into which the Chicago platform had plunged it. He went to work and constructed a new platform in accord with Western ideas on the tariff and financial questions, and it was solely to the Allison diversion that the Repub licans owe their victory. For this rea son, if for no other, is Mr. Allison en- titled to the choice of cabinet positions. But there are other reasons which com- mend him. Personally he is a man of high character, and of very superior abilities. No man has a better standing in the senate, and certainly no Republican senator can exhibit a cleaner record. But there is . an additional reason, and the strongest one of -all, why Senator Allison should be given the treasury portfolio. He is a typical Western man, thoroughly imbued with Western ideas; and if, as secretary of the treasury, he puts into practice the doctrines he has always ad vocated iv the senate | and at home, it will be a proud day for the West when Allison is placed at the head of the treasury department. It will require a great deal of moral courage on the pait of Gen. Harrison to stand up under the storm of indignation that will sweep down from Wall street in case Allison is selected for the treasury department; more, we fear, than he will be able to muster. Yet, if he is courageous enough to do it, his administration will win public confidence at the start. Wall street has had a sinch on the treasury department so long it will be like pulling the eye teeth of the New York money kings to see a man who is an honest . advocate of bimc-talism now placed in control of the finances of the government. Garfield had it in mind to make Allison secre tary of the treasury, but he didn't have the moral courage to carry out' his pur pose; so a Western man who was known to be in sympathy with Wall street was selected. To some it may seem im pertinent for a newspaper with Demo- cratic tendencies to offer suggestions relative to cabinet appointments under a Republican administration^ but there is such an apparent fitness in the sug gestion of Senator Allison's name for the treasury portfolio the Globe would be remiss in its duty to Western inter ests if it did not signify its approval of the proposed appointment. _o». .

Others -attribute ;it to the equally foolish wheat speculation, while there y are others who are fully confident that it is due to the unjust discrimination against silver. Perhaps all. are contributory causes, as there may be others yet undiscovered. It is true the foreign holders of - American railway securities are not jubilant at "the prospect of dividends in the face of existing rate wars, and it would ybe a most rational thing for them to do to dispose of their American holdings and salt their money down in , something more substantial. The American : se curities thus thrown upon the market by foreign holders must be paid for in gold when the balance of trade is against it. Then the unhealthy specu lation in wheat has -virtually stopped all grain shipments, because the foreign buyers can procure their wheat sup- plies more cheaply from Russia and India. Still, with the balance of trade against us, and these • drains upon ; our gold resources, this country is in a fair way to hold its own for. a year or two, anyhow. We have a stock of $500,000, - of gold on hand and we produce about $35,000,000 annually, so there is no danger of a gold famine for a time, at least. '-/'-' '"'.A. 77* 7? ■» NAMING THE DAKOTAS. 7 With division and admission in sight, our Dakota friends are no little worried over the selection of names for the twin states when they enter the national sis- terhood. This question is more of a worry to the people of the northern part of the territory than those in the south- crn part. Congress 'will probably ob- ject to the admission of any more North and South states, Hereafter each new state is expected to come in with a dis tinct and separate name. If this idea is adhered to in the division and admission - of Dakota as two states, the southern division will unquestionably cling to the old territorial name. The northern division will then be forced to adopt a new* name, which they would dislike to do because the name Dakota has a value in all the wheat markets of the world. Dakota wheat is known the world over, ranking highest in quality and price; and a great deal of it is grown on North Dakota soil. If North Dakota comes into the sisterhood of states under a new name it will take some time for foreign wheat buyers . to adjust themselves to the change, and to learn that Lincoln wheat, or Ilarrison wheat, or whatever may be the name of the new state, is grown on what was once Dakota soil, and is the "same grain that was once quoted as J Dakota wheat. Under the circumstances, we are in- clined to the opinion that congress should waive its prejudice against North and South •states, and allow both ends of the greatest wheat-growing ter ritory in the world to retain the ad- vantage possessed in the present name. 

BRIBE BY IN ELECTIONS. 7 There is a disposition, now that a po litical calm is inaugurated, to investi- gate the matter of bribery at elections. It is conceded that it has become a feature that may lead to the most dan- gerous results if continued. The moral- ize'* can hardly draw too dark a picture of the possibilities in that line. Look- ing through the fogs of partisanship, it is beyond question that the practical hand in national politics means a full one. Reliance was not had upon the millions of political tracts or diffused oratorical roll. The arguments that convinced had a metallic ring or rustled like new paper. It is not insisted by the fair- minded that the political conscience is the exclusive property of either party. It may be assumed that the managers on both sides used all the money they could get in whatever way they believed would count in the ballot. The discus- sion and investigation should be di- vested of partisan features and a public sentiment developed that will demand the most rigid enactments against bribery of voters or the use of vast sums of money in elections. . «_»' . DISEASE GERMS. : ... It is among the discoveries of modern science that most the more common diseases, and nearly all of the conta gious . ones, are caused by bacteria— micro-organisms. Their classification and means of destruction without de- stroying human life are suggested as possible achievements of the future. In the latest [number of the Forum, Dr. Austin Flint regards it as highly probable that the time will come when the cause of every infectious disease will be known; all such will be prevent- ible or easily curable; protection will be afforded against all .such diseases as scarlet fever, measles, yellow fever, whooping cough, etc., in which one at- tack affords immunity from subsequent contagion. The writer concludes, in fact, that no constitutional diseases will be incurable, and such scourges as epi demics will be unknown. That is a con- summation to be cheerfully welcomed, I even if it does prolong the sojourn of a class of. people better adapted to some other world. x WONDROUS WEATHER. .7 . Oh, how gently those summer zephyrs fanned our brows yesterday. Well, there is no use talking about this weather. When this Minnesota coun- try starts in to do anything, it is done, and there is no half-way style of doing it, either. We started out to beat Cali fornia on winter climates. We are j .sorry for the Californians that it had to be done, because its winter climate is the only resource California had left. But just see how we are getting along with the job of laying out a California winter climate. Here it is the first week in December and people hunting for the shady side of the streets. The overcoat is a burthen, and the only com- fortable man is the one who is not ashamed to go ou the street in his shirt , sleeves. ■•■ y:-~ ::-j A DEAD LAW. Nearly all the states have laws- against- betting on elections, but int : stances of their enforcement are almos unknown. There have occasionally been indictments, but convictions did not follow. A few years ago a judge ]in Illinois thought he would be doing the people a service in enforcing the stat ute. He instructed the grand jury to do diligent work, . and indictments were brought in against about half the voters of the town, but no competent jury could be secured and nothing came of " the effort. Betting is a mild form of gambling; at least, public sentiment views if very mildly, and a law isn't worth much that is in antagonism to public sentiment. ' y iw — tt— : ■ ■- PROMINENT PEOPLE.

First, I have no reason to suppose that President Harrison will tender to Sena- tor Sherman a position in the cabinet; sec- ond, I do not believe that Senator Sherman either desires the place or would accept it if offered to him: third, I think the situation of Ohio politics is such as lo forbid the neces sity aud negative the policy of Senator Sher- man leaving the senate at this time. :- V- yy;

At sixteen ; years of : age :he took 7up the carpenter's 7 trade, and after four years' f service,, engaged in -business of 7 the "manufacture of stoves and salt in Syra cuse, in which he continued four years. In 1858, having meanwhile been - em- ployed as an arcnitect and builder, he came to Stillwater, Minn., when, in 1861, he was awarded the contract for prison labor, and engaged the convicts in coopering and in the manufacture of; sash, doors and blinds. He continued under his contract for eight years, hay- ing had several partners associated with him, uutil in 1869, when the firm of Seymour, Sabin & Co. came into ex- istence, which was incorporated in 1874 under title of the Manufacturing Cor- poration of Seymour, Sabin & Co., with Dwight M. Sabin as president, and 6. M. Seymour, vice president. When the concern became absorbed by the North- western Manufacturing & Car com- pany, he became a stockholder in that institution, retiring from it in the fail of, 1884. In 1880 he took a trip to Lead- ville and spent some time there, for two years acquiring a very general knowl- edge of silver mining and obtaining: mining interests, some of which he still retains.

Mr. Jay then out- lined the proposed movement. It was to be ; neither sectarian nor narrow, but broadly Christian and thoroughly American.- A crisis had come in the affairs of the city. The influx of the' foreign tide was perverting our institu tions, corrupting our politics, and es tranging the people from .churches. Evangelical Christianity must be 7 the bulwark to check the flood of unbelief and immorality. Mr. Jay introduced Rev. J. M. King, of the M. E. churn, who spoke on the topic "New York Above Fourteenth Street." He displayed a map of the locality named, and showed that while the saloon had kept numeri cal pace with the growing population, the Protestant churches had remained nearly stationary in number, and in some cases had fallen off. If the saloons were represented by small clouds on the map, they would obscure the stars which denoted churches. The saloons controlled 40.000, and were open day and night. Their proprietors did not take vacations in the summer. In 32,300 tenements live 1,100,000 souls. Outof 500, - population only 100,000 are members of churches. Dr. King defined the evils to be met as follows in the order of their importance: Romanism and its machinery, indifference, Juda- ism and its exclusiveness, inactivity of professing Christians, foreign-bred re- j sistance to Americanizing influence, sa- loons, tenements. These evils were still greater below Fourteenth street. Dr. A. F. Schauffler, V. P., of the city mission, spoke of* "New York Below Fourteenth Street." and his map was far more cloudy with saloons . and less starry with churches than that of Dr. King. The population down town, Dr. Schauffler said, is denser, to-day. than . ever before, . notwithstanding the on- ward march of business. All told, there were 137 churches below Fourteenth street, while the population was 621,000. Ten years ag(v when the population was "considerably less, - there I were 141 churches. What was needed down town was more home mission work, more Christian workers who would go among the tenements and encourage their occupants to attend divine wor- I ship; the attendance at the churches I down town is gradually- decreas- ing, in spite of the increased population; if necessary, paid mis- sionaries should be employed; j missionary work was needed here more "than in foreign lands. Unless Christian- ity and order are firmly established we must expect anarchy and revolt. - The Rev. George U. Winner spoke concern- ing the 400,000 Germans of the city. Of these but 16,000 are church members, 10,000 of them be- ing Lutherans; internal dissen sions in German churches, he said, were the greatest cause of lack of in- terest taken in church matters by Ger- mans, and tenacious opposition to the use of the English language in German churches was another great reason. He .urged English churches to appoint Ger- mans as assistant clergymen, whose duties should be to secure the attend- y ance of German youths at the churches. .The meeting will be resumed te-mor- row morning. 7 '■'."■ .^ — — '"•'-;■''••■ Three Killed Outright.

POPE LEOJN/RIVATE. His Holiness Discourses on the Topics of the Times. Not Moved by the Recent Visit of the German Emperor. Bismarck a Reasonable Man Who Has Made Valuable - . Concessions. The Teaching" Rights of the The Teaching Rights of the Church Must Be Recog nized. A correspondent of the Daily Tele- A correspondent of the Daily Tele graph in Rome had the honor of being received in special and private audience by the pope on Thursday, who con versed with him at considerable length. I presented myself (says the corre spondent) at the main entrance to the state apartments a little before 10:30, and, upon giving my name, was at once ushered through a suite of stately sa loons to the throne room, at the open door of which a monsignor— one of the papal chamberlains— met me with outstretched hand and kindly wel come, begging me to wait for a few minutes. An attendant Mon signor was good enough to bear me company, and to point out to me the "new splendors" of the state saloons, which have recently been refurnished in crimson and gold and adorned with beautiful tapestries, vases and objets dart chosen from among the venerable pontiff's jubilee gifts. The throne from which the Sal del Trono takes its name is the one presented to his holiness by the Spaniards— a magnificent piece of workmanship, daintily carved and richly gilt. In the framework of its deep crim son velvet baldaquin are encrusted two superb agates about the size of ostrich eggs. Shortly after the innumerable clocks of the state apartmeuts" had ceased striking the hour, my summons came, and 1 was conducted to a small, some what dimly-lighted room at a right angle to the antechamber leading out of the throne room. At the further end of this apartment, enthroned on a dais raised a few inches above the ground, sat Pope Leo Xlll.. his white robes and mozzetta and pallid complexion cast into high relief by the dark crimson hue of the hangings covering the walls. On either side of the throne were ranged three chairs, to one of which the near- est to him on his right hand— he mo- tioned me after I had made the custom- ary salutations, in acknowledgment of Which his holiness half rose from his' seat and bent his head toward me. I then ventured to ask his holiness if the German emperor's recent visit to ■ the Vatican proved satisfactory to my august interlocutor. "I cannot say," he replied, "that we arc either satisfied or dissatisfied with the emperors visit. That he came to Home was not at our request; nor was his object in coming favorable to us, but rather to those who are against us— to those who, for ten years past, have practically compelled me to restrict myself to this place, from whicli I cannot issue. My dignity for- bids me to do so. This young man (questo giovane), having acceded to the German throne, has been making a round of visits to European courts, and finally to . Rome, where his presence was calculated to strengthen our ad- versaries and consolidate their position, not to benefit us. . lie came to see me; it was an act of courtesy, and I was glad to receive him. I had much to say to him, but just as I was beginning my discourse he interrupted me by calling in his brother, in order to present him to me. "With regard to our modus Vivendi with Germany, in many respects I have good reason to be satisfied, Prom the German government 1 have obtained many valuable concessions. Bismarck is a reasonable man; he can be con- vinced, and I have found him willing to accede to just requests. His son, too, who had a long audience of me on the evening of the 17th, seems very sensible and earnest. With our episcopacy and clergy in Germany all is going smoothly and satisfactorily. The vacant offices have been properly filled up with the accord of church and state alike, and to the contentment of both. We are in ne gotiation about the withdrawal of the "prohibitions affecting our educational orders; but- there is great difficulty. . The German government ' desires to keep in its own hands the exclusive in- struction of Catholic children. To this I cannot consent. The teaching rights of the church must be recognized, and their exercise must be duly authorized by the state. With less than this 1 may not be satisfied; and, as you know, when the pope is dissatisfied the Cath olics are discontented." The above (adds the correspondent), allowing for certain invincible differ- ences between the Italian and English idioms, is the exact purport of the chief statements and observations to which Leo
