For any one working in any of the mines these Lots should surely be interest­ ing as north of the NORTH SIDE ADDITION, one of the biggest mines will be opened. The Sauntry,Sliver, Enterprise and the Alpena mines are nearer to this ad­ dition than to any other part of the city. This fact should be looked into be­ fore you purchase Lots elsewhere.

Entered at tbe Poet-Office at Virginia, Minn., as second class mail matter. Terms. $2 Per Year, in Advance GEN. J. H. BAKER, of Red Wing, has written a book on the governors of Minnesota, from Ramsey to John­ son. Fail to find an autobiography of either Dunn or Jacobson i.i the work. THE second session of the sixtieth congress convened on Monday. One law that ought to be passed should make it a misdemeanor tor a Minne­ sota voter to split his ballot in a presidential year. THE first annual meeting of the Minnesota Roadmakers' Associa­ tion will be held at St. Paul, under the auspices of the state highway commission, on December 15,16 and 17. Such an organization can find plenty of work in this new northern section of the state. IN connection with the discussion which has been brought up by the range press relative a more equit­ able distribution of the county road fund, what would be the matter with a rule to have such fund divided prorata according to the size of the commissioner districts. This might keep a few dollars of the taxes paid by the ranges in the range districts, where they rightly belong. PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has brand­ ed the editors of the New York Sun and the Indianapolis News as"liars" and the scribes do not take kindly to the President's plain manner of stating things. And it is more than likely that the President of this great republic will find that he is not fighting bears before the irate quill pushers get through talking to him and of him. IN his last message to Congress, President Roosevelt voices one sentiment that will meet with the unqualified approval of Judge Carey, of the local municipal court. The President asserts that, "Begin­ ning with the supreme court, the judges should have their salaries doubled." Such a course would make of the local mill of justice a fair job, considering the fact that the city now pays the incumbent a salary of $2400 per annum. THE range organization of civic leagues will ask the State Anti Saloon League to assist in the work of cleansing the ranges by sending a representative to this section for the purpose of organizing branches in the various range municipalities. Many there are on the ranges who do not object to the saloon but who do object to the idea of having the saloon run without regard to law and run the political policies of the communities, or try to do so, as well. THE 

BIWABIK TIMES, in reference to the tonnage tax on ore, says that "nothing was heard of this mode of taxation until J. J. Hill had disposed of his ore land holdings to the steel trust." The Times man, if he will get the "dope" out of his system and study the question for about thirty seconds will find that the tonnage tax was tirst introduced in the Minnesota legislature in 1897, while the Hill ore lands were not disposed of to the steel company for several years thereafter. THE DULUTH HERALD would be the Bponsor for a law requiring the actual ownership of newspapers to be made public. Such a law would meat with the approval ot readers in general, as they would then know whether they were devouring the boiled down meat of the corporate interests who presumably control most of the big dailies or are feed­ ing from the honest ideas of one whose welfare in life depends upon preaching what he considers is for the best interests of the people as a whole. JACOB K. JACOBSON, who ran for governor as the special protege of the former employe of Mabel Evans at the time of the famous "Virginia Sliver" state lease was given, has been cited to appear before Public Examiner Anton Schaefer to explain irregularities in connection with the purchase of board of control supplies taking place during the time of Mr. Jacobson's service on the board. Amounts involved are said to run into the thousands of dollars, although the public exam­ iner has refused to give any detailed statement of his findings until Mr. Jacobson has been given an oppor tunity to explain. UNDER recent instructions from the general land office timber and stone filings will be temporarily abandoned, although for what pur­ pose is not definitely stated, the in­ structions coming by wire. It is thought likely, however, that the act means the future sale of govern ment lands sought under the stone and timber act by appraised valua­ tion, a new regulation promulgated by the general land office so amend­ ing the stone and timber act of June 3, 1878, as to provide that timber and atone lands shall be sold at a mini­ mum of $2.50 pet acre, necessitating an appraisal of value in future be­ fore lands are proven and patented. Heretofore a flat rate of $2.50 per acre has been maintained, but under the new ruling the remaining lands will likely bring much higher figures, although the choice lota are gone. FKANK PINTO IS the name given by a Hibbing unfortunate who was shipped by the west end authorities to Duluth (or treatment after having been held up and filled full of lead, Pinto presenting an appearance upon his arrival in Duluth that elicited the sympathy ot the police of the head of the lakes. He was nearly dead upon his arrival in Du­ luth, unattended and unannounced, and as he staggered into the depot covered with blood and suffering from three bullet wounds he was taken in charge by the police and sent to a hospital. Perhaps the Hib­ bing authorities have the right line on getting rid of those who are wounded in hold-up games, but the method is not one which, when fully realized, is destined to appeal to the merciful.
