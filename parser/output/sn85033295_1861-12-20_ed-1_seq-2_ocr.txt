Those “Peculiar Circumstances.” Hating trailed reasonable time, and of fered our coluras for explanation of the act of the late County Board in donating ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO DOL LARS and a half to the sickly democratic German paper of this city, it is now prop er to ascertain what construction should be put upon their contumacious silence. Are the men who perpetrated this gross •utrage dumb, under a sense of their guilt or extreme foolishness, and yet without the redeeming virtue to acknowledge the crime? or, do they now intend to add in ■ult, by refusing to reply to inquiries put to them by these whose confidence they have abused and whose money they have corruptly appropriated? One of those must be the cause of this significant si lence. Matters have come to a fine pass, hi deed, when the people’s money is used in this way, and the corrupt Officials who do it show themselves so far without the pale of decency, as to not deign an expla nation of their conduct! In this state of the ease, as conservative of the public wel fare, we propose to present our readers with what vre have ascertained of the mat ter : Wo learn that the Board had pre- j liously voted, or recommended, that the dvertisemont of the Delinquent Tax List hould be given to a German paper in the County ; meaning, probably, that it should be published in German ; under the mis taken idea, that justice to the German population required this. The County Treasurer, notwithstanding ibis vote, very ' properly considered that, as the Statute had made the matter of advertising the List solely his business, in stead of the bu siness of the Board, and that, as the dem ocratic press had immemorially received the county patronage of this kind, in the absence of any known exclusive right of democrats, gave the Advertisement to two Republican papers in the County, whose joint circulation was at least three times that of any German paper in the County. By this means the Advertisement had, to say the least, a circulation one-sixth wider than it would have had, hj the substitu tion of the Welileryer for either of the pa pers which were selected. Had the Re publican been excluded, in favor of our German neighbor, a populaticn twice as large as all the German population in the County would have been entirely excluded from seeing it in this altogether the most populous and wealthy part of the County. The greedy beneficiary of Official Cor ruption, well knowing the unscrupulous ness of the Board by its democratic pre ponderance and previous practices, was not to be balked by the just and independent course of the upright Treasurer, but, pre suming on his ultimate success in obtain ing the “steal,” inserted the Advertise ment without authority or request, and coolly presented the bill for services which the committee to whom it was referred de clared were rendered without authority, and it was allowed ! Such is the simple history of this disgraceful transaction, as we have learned the facts. From a member of the Board who voted in favor of the bill we learn that the alleg ed basis of the vote was, Ist. The previ ous recommendation that the advertise ment be published in a German paper ; and, 2d., that the Germans ought to have an opportunity to read it in their language. In reply to this defense of this “steal,” we unhesitatingly affirm that this vote of the board was, not. only totally unauthori zed, but a flagrant usurpation. We learn that the very conscientious members, who did not scruple to lavish the people’s mon ey upon their political favorite without stint or authority, manifested holy horror at the conduct of the Treasurer in not obsequiously submitting to the encroach ment, when repentance and acknowledge of their great sin, would certainly have been much more becoming in them. Here was swallowing an elephant, and straining at nothing! The plea, that the Weltburger ought to be paid for inserting the advertisement, on the ground that the German population should have an oppor tunity to read it, in the mouth of any man acquainted with the facts in the ease, man ifests a shocking degreo of duplicity.— What will the people think of this matter, when they learn the truth, that all these professions were the merest cant imasina ablo, adopted and used for the sole pur pose of deceiving the public, and avert ing merited condemnation and just punish ment? Neither was the spirit and intent of the vote carried cut, nor weio the Germans, for whom regard was hypocriti cally professed, favored, by this bastard publication ; for the very good reason that, although the paper was German, the Ad vertisement was inserted in English / Tb payment of $162,50 for an unauthori zed publication of an Advertisement and placing it before readers not one in an hun dred of whom could read a word ot it, lor the credit cf humanity we would hope is without a parallel. Most men would re gard an open, day-light robbery, as Its criminal than such sneaking thieving un der false {retenccs. And yet, notwith standing they have perpetrated the high crime—the German Judas who held the bag, and his equally guilty accomplices, who scraped this pile of the People's mon ey into it, walk gaily about, as sleek and untainted as a cat which has licked Lis chops after having poached in his owner’s poultry yard ! After the dark deed w. s done, no doubt, informally, tho adjourn ment was to meet next at the nearest den of carousal, where virtually was enact ed the Fable of tiie Mischievous Boys and the Unfortunate Frogs,—who said, though it might be sport to the juveniles, it was death to them ! Such is democracy; and such its rule in Jefferson County. We earnestly exhort all good men to pray that this most accursed dominion of the Beast may be speedily and perpetually termina ted. The Late News. It will be perceived by cur telegraphic dispatches that the reception in England of the intelligence of the capture of Ma son and Slidell, and the taking them for cibly from an English packet aroused the rebel sympathizers amongst the English Press to a high pitch of blustering. The same act done towards an English vessel, whieh the English have long been in the habit of doing to others, when they' are the subjects of it, looks to them like a mon strous insult. As is usual in such circum stances, a thousand rumors prevail relative to the course which will be pursued by tho English Government, and of this unaufhen tic character is the statement that tee British had condemned the seizure and de cided to demand the giving up of the rebel commissioners. There does not at pres ent seem to exist the remotest probability that such a demand, or anything akin to it, will be made ; they too well understand the character of our people and govern ment to not be aware that such a peremp tory demand on their part must inevitably, either be withdrawn, or lead to a war. Our government will undoubtedly plant itself upon the obvious ground which has heretofore been well defined and settled, and upon that basis fearlessly abide the issue. At the present time, as well as un der different circumstances, no power on earth can bully the Union out of its just rights ; to submit to any unjust demands would be infinitely worse than death or annihilation. If it is the best that can bo done, let us leave to the world the legacy of an untarnished name. It is doubtful whether England could gain anything by a war with us ; if she could drive our commerce from the seas, our privateers could greatly injure her commerce, and she must ultimately lose her American colonial possessions, and probably would not gain much cotton, be sides losing the valuable trade which will | result from a continuance of amicable rela tions. It is not improbable that a war with England would introduce some Euro pean complications, not very favorable to England, on account of which she may con - sider discretion the better part of valor.— The State Journal well remarks ; “A ery likely this new war-cloud will blow over, but if it dees not there are live ly times ahead. England cannot enter this conflict without involving other Euro pean powers, and they will not all be on the side of slavery. We shall not fight alone. Even if all the despots of the old World league against us, the revolutionary forces they can hardly restrain in times of peace will burst forth with volcanic vio lence, and Ireland, France, Germany and Hungary will furnish them with all the fighting they can attend to nearer home. Rebel Property—Order Of Sec. Chase. The Secretary of the Treasury has is sued general regulations relative to secur ing and disposing of the property found or brought within the territory now or here after occupied by the United States forces in the disloyal States. The chief features of the order are these : The secretary of the Treasury is to appoint agents, who shall reside at such ports or places in the territory of the r, fe els as are now, or may hereafter be occu *pied by the National troops; the grand du ty of these agents shall be to gather and prepare tor market the crops grown in the regions under their supervision. In this work the military and naval forces of the United States sha.il aid by giving protec tion. Moreover, all slaves found within ■ the limit of the agent’s authority may be and are to be by him employed in gather j h’g. and preparing for market the cotton and other crops ; lists of the names, sex age, and general condition of these slaves, together with the names of their alleged owners, are to be kept by the agent ; the slaves so enrolled will be set to work in a systematic manner, and a strict account of their labor kept, f r which a fair rate of compensation will be paid. A record of ail the products and ail stock taken pos session of will also be kept, that of each plantation by itself; and when packages are shipped they are to be so marked as to be easily distinguished. When the cot ton and other articles are prepared for market, they shall be shipped to New York, consigned to the designated airent there. Ibis order, which conies in logical sequence after the success ef the expedi tion, will bo with alacrity endorsed in ail its provisions by the people of the North, who desire and rejoice in enlightened pro gress. Gen. Halleck.— I The Chicago Tribune notices the tact, that at the very moment that the rebel General Thompson is em ploying four hundred slaves to erect for tifications at New Madrid, the Colonel com manding the national forces at Bird’s Puint, higher up the Mississippi river, is every day compelled by the order of Gen. llalleck to drive off the escaped slaves of rebels, who come to offer their services to the national cause. The Truth Confessed. The following, from a British journal, is ample confession, that England is aware that the conduct of Capt. Wilkes was not a breach of law or comity. The complaint is that our government has come up to tho line oi our rights. Ot all meanness in the world, that is tho lowest which seeks pre texts on such grounds, and takes the occa sion when a hated rival is engaged in a quarrel with another opponent. There can be but little reasonable doubt that the movement sf the three powers on Mexico has more reference to us than to our near neighbor. It least of all becomes our government to falter; courage and high moral bearing alone can save the nation, and these traits we have no doubt our government will show. Let tho Union at Last preserve its honour, do its duty, aud trust the Almighty Arbiter. Capt. Wilkes' “Wrotched Blunder." The event has arou.-ed in this country the strongest feeling of indignation. ‘-The City very fairly represents the public in its popular sentiments on such subjects, and yesterday the Exchanges of London and Liverpool were the scenes of an ex citement which has not been witnessed for a longtime. The sense of anger was min gled with an impression that such an out rage on the British flag must be resented ; and the fall of the funds was the response. “Will there be wtr !” No, we say. For the reasons already stated, we do not look for hostilities as likely to spring from the act, taken by itself, but undoubtedly it has shocked the nation, and has materially tunic i the tide ef popular feeling against the federal government. Nor can it fail to impose new aud sterner duties upon our own executive. If that letter of law which the Americans invoke were rigidly enforc ed against them, an important branch of their present operations would be arrested. We have already said that the blockade of the Southern ports is wholly ineffective.— But any attacks upon the vessels of a friendly power pursuing friendly commerce under the pretext of a blockad'e which is not veritably carried out according to rule, is a trespass that ought not to be tolera te 1 ; and it occurs to us as not impossible that if the federal government should thus press the letter of the law against friends as well as enemies, it may find itself com pelled in the same manner to recognize the strictest construction with regard not only to the right of search, but of blockade.— The wretched blunder info which Capt. Y ilkes and Mr. Fairfax were rushing, the manner of executing an ungracious and questionable intrusion, and the whole na ture of the proceedings, teach us to be prepared for still rasher measures at the same hands. Those whe have so indiscreetly become our assailant have betrayed a keen jealousy of any free constructions on our part, while they have summarily taken the widest license for themselves. Any perseverance in such course cannot, however, be permit ted. Because they are unable to keep order in their own States, the federalists must not be suffered to trifle with English interests ; and if they commit many more mistakes the offence may meet with chas tisement prompt and severe.—London Tele graph. The Wisconsin State Journal. This is one of the best papers published in the State. Politicians and all others who want to keep posted in state news have to take the Journal, or go in igno rance of much that it is desirable to know. During the sessions of the Legislature the Journal’s reports of the doings there are always full and reliable Asa general newspaper, also, it ranks among the ablest and best in Wisconsin. As it is the offic ial paper of the State, all laws, proclama" tions, official notices, &e. Ac., have to be published in it, which adds much to its value and interest. We could not keep house without it, and would advise every Jefferson county man who wants a first class paper to send along the subscription price to the Journal at once, after having ordered himself booked for the Watertown Republican. Of course, it is the duty of every one to take his home paperyi;^. The following are the terms of the Jour nal :

Remember— when you learn how high your taxes are, and how hard it is to pay them at such times as the present, that the Taxpayers ot this County have been ROB BED by the County Board to donate $lO2, 50 to the pauper 11 ellburger, of this city. If you want to know why taxes are so high, you hare only to take that as a sample of the democratic rule under which our city groans—a system of abuse which makes the property holders the worst off— actu ally parcelling cut the “property without authority, as in the case of our neighbor. "W e respectfully recommend that, hereafter, all such cases be handed over to the Poor Master. Daniel's Wisconsin Cavalry The troubles in reference to the first regiment of Wisconsin Cavalry, Colonel Daniels, have been arranged, and the filling up of the regiment is progressing satisfactorily.

Dec. 14.—A special dis patch from Baltimore to the Philadelphia Inquirer attributes the fire at Charleston to a slave insurrection, and says that one half of Charleston is in ruins ! Baltimore, Dec 15. —We learn from the Captain of the Norfolk boat that he was informed by the Captain of the steam er Illinois, which had arrived at Old Point from Port Royal, that he passed within six miles of Charleston harbor at ten o'clock on I'hursday night, and a tremendous con flagration was evidently at its height in that city. The reflection on the elouds ex ceeded anything he ever saw, and the whole bay was brightly illuminated. It did not appear like a reflection from smouldering ruins hut from a i aging con flagration. This is later than the Norfolk Day Book dispatch. Baltimore, Dec. 17- —A passenger by the steamer from Fort Monroe, reports the arrival of the steamer Connecticut, at Old Point, with the intelligence that Fort Pu laski has been evacuated by the rebels and is occuj ied by the Federal troops. Halifax, Doc. 15.—The following addi tional items were received by the city of Washington : The transport Melbourne would leave Woolwich for Halifax on the sth with 30,- 000 arms, a large amount of ammunition and a battery of six annstrong guns. Hie will be conveyed by the Orpheus, a 21- gun frigate. The Warrior would be ready for foreign service immediately. Her destination de pends on the answer from Washington, Mr. Bright made an elaborate speech on the American question, in which be de clined to give any decided opinion in the Trent affair. He believed if the act was illegal that America would make fitting re paration. Ha strongly condemned the warlike feeling, and scouted the idea that the American Cabinet bad resolved to [ ick a quarrel with England. Ho made an eloquent peroration in favor of the North. A letter was received from S'r Richard Cobden, of a pacific tone, urging a suspen sion of judgment. A letter from Gen. Scott, in favor of maintaining friendly relations between England and America, attracts much at tention. The exportation of arms, ammunition, and lead, has been prohibited. The report of the demand of the Eng lish Government for the surrender of Ma son and Slidell causes great excitement.— The sentiment of defiance is universal at Wash ington. Portland, Me., Dec. 18.—The steamer Jura, from Liverpool on the afternoon of the sth, and Londonderry on the 6th, ar rived here this morning. The excitement relative to the Trent affair continues unabated. The stock market, on the 4th, was more heavy and unsettled than e ver. The U. S. Consul at Paris had commu nicated to the French papers a letter from Gen. Scott, in winch he declares that there is no truth in the report that the Cabinet bad ordered the seizure of the Southern Commissioners, even under the protection of a neutral flag. He is quite ignorant of the decision of his government, but says it is necessary to preserve good relations be tween America and England, and he hopes both governments will agree on a solution of the question, whether the prisoners were contraband or not. If they are agents of the rebels, he says it will he difficult te convince even impartial minds that they were less contraband of war than rebel soldiers or cannon. In conclusion, Gen. Scott expresses the conviction that war be- L een America and England, without more serious provocation than is at present given is impossible. The London Star thinks that Gsn. Scott’s letter will receive a hearty re sponse in Kngland as a message of peace. The Times says that Gen. Scott, like his countrymen, is rather inclined to dis avow the conception of the outrage than to repudiate it. It is reported that rebel privateers are cruising at the entrance of the English Channel. It is said the admiralty ordered two ships to proceed immediately to the West Indies to act as a convoy to the mail steam ers. The Paris correspondent of the Daily News states that Slidell’s dispatches were entrusted to his wife as be was leaving the Trent. The Paris Patrie learns that the San Jacinto, in November, searched a French, Danish and a Portuguese vessel. These faets, says the latrie, are of some impor tance as proving that the Washington Cabinet fancies it has power to exercise the right of search to the fullest extent. Speculations from France represent the predominant tone of feeling as favorable to a reconciliation between England and America. It is reported that the French Minister at Washingtan reported to his government a refusal on the part of the Washington Cabinet to deliver up dispatches addressed from Paris to the French Consuls at Charleston and New Orleans- New York, Dec. 13. —It is freely stated that there are a number of letters of marque in this city, issued by Tie Mexican Government to prey upon the commerce of England, France and Spain, and that vessels are fitting out here, which they have a right to do under similar decision, to that allowing the Nashville to fit out at Southampton. Vessels will sail under the Mexican flag as war vessels, and be enti tled to bring prizes into neut:a! pi rts. The official count of vote gives Opdyke 1,213 majority over Wood and 614 over Gunther for Mayor. Great Mountain, Dee. 14.—Special Dis patch to the Cincinnati Commercial.—On yesterday one of the hardcst-fuught battles 1 of the war was fought at Allegheny Camp, Pocahontas county, Ya., Gen. R. H. Mill roy commanding the Union troops, and Gen. Johnson, of Ga., commanding the rebels. The fight lasted from daylight till 3 P. M. The Union loss was about 30; the rebel loss is over 200, including a Major and many other officers, and 80 prisoners. Gen. Johnson was shot in the mouth, but is not fatally injured. The Twelfth Geor gia Regiment suffered most. Milroy’s forces numbered 750 men from the Ninth and Thirteenth Indiana, Twen ty-fifth and Thirty-third Ohio, and Second 5 irginia. Johnson's force numbered over 2,000. The Ninth Indiana fought bravely to the last. After driving the enemy into their boundary no less than five times, our forces retired in good order. The rebels set fire te their camp and retreated to Stan ton. j Gen. Milroy has driven the last rebel army out ofWestern Virginia. Pirllippi, a.. Dee. 15.—A force con- j sistirgof the Ninth Indiana, and detaeb-i merits from the Thirteenth Indiana, Twen tietb and Thirty-Second Ohio, and the Second and Third b irginia and Rigg’s and Brocken’s Cavalry, in all about* 1,800 men, under command of Geri. Melroy, left Cheat Mountain on the 13th for the pur pose of driving the rebel from theirfortified camp on the Alleghany Mountains. Our force came in sight of the enemy drawn up in line of battle in front of their entrenchments, charged on them, and drove them hack. A hot fire was kept up during the afternoon by both sides. Several brilliant charges were made by our men. Gen. Milrcy withdrew at nightfall, in tending to renew the attack iu the morn ing. During the night the rebels left their camp silently, burning everything they could not carry with them. Our loss was 30 killed and 30 wounded. The rebel loss is believed to be not less than 150 killed, including a field officer.— W e have 30 prisoners. By this last brilliant achiovment Gen. Reynold’s front has been cleared of the enemy, there being no organized rebel force within forty miles of our advance post. A detachment sent out from this place yesterdv, returned this evening with ten rebel guerillas, including the notorious Jake Kuru Halifax, Dec. 15.—The Europa, from Liverpool 30th, via Queenstown 2, being detained twelve boura at Queenstown arriv ed here to-day. Latest via Queenstown —Speculations on the San Jacinto affair are rife, but it is generally believed there is less cause to fear a rupture between the two Govern ments. A Privy Council was held at Windsor on Saturday. The Observer, a ministeral journal, states that a special messenger by the Europa, carries a demand of the British Government to Lord Lyons, insisting on an apology, and restoration to the British flag of Mason and Slidell. The same paper says that large rein forcements are to be sent immediately to Canada. A large ship is now loading with guns and ammunition for there. The Ob server says there is no reason why commissioners should not be restored to the ship of a British Admiral in the face of ten or twelve British men-of-war on the Potomac. Nearly ail the papers treat the question in the same spirit. The agitation increa ses. Washington, Dec. 17. —The President has received no official information from England relative to the Mason and Slidell affair. The Cabinet was in session for several hours yesterday, during which our difficulty with England was discussed with great calmness and firmness. Whatever the demand from England may be (and the English newspaper bluster is not taken as any true indication of the intention of the Government,) our Government has resolved that Mason and Slidell shall never be given up. This may he relied upon as a fixed fact. The impression is that Eng land will make a demand for the release of the rebels seized, but that a lenghty correspondence would settle the matter without war. The rumors of a messenger arriving post haste, are false. No ultimation from the English Government in regard to Mason and Slidell is expected at the beginning of diplomatic correspondence. Washington, Dec. 15.—The Europa’s dispatches excite a lively discussion here, but seeme not to disturb the government, which, while desiring no embarrassment with England, looks with composure and confidence on events as they occur. Fort Monroe, xfec. 16.—Norfolk and Richmond papers give full particulars of the extensive conflagration in Charleston, s. c. The fire broke out on the 11th inst. in a sash and blind factory at the foot of Hazel street, extending to the machine shop of Cameron & Cos. Before midnight the fire had assumed an appaling magnitude, and Meeting street, from Market to Queen, was a mass of flame. As tenement after tenemen became en veloped in flames tbe panic became awful, and thousands of familes evacuated their houses and filled the streets. The buildings in the lower part of the city, where the fire broke out, were prin cipally of wood and extremely inflammable which accounts for the remarkably rapid progress of the fire. At midnight the Circular Church and Institute Hall were burning, and the proximity of the flame to the Charleston Hotel and the Mill’s House caused them to bo evacuated by their in mates. At 1 o’clock the fire extended more southward towards the corner of Archdale and Queen streets to the rear of the Charleston Hotel and the end of Home street. Crossing Market street, tho fire spread down East Bay st. to Comberland street and across to the Mills House, in cluding, in its destruction, the Circular Church, Institue Hall and the Charleston Hotel. All the buildings on King street, from Clifford nearly to Broad st., were destroyed before 3 o’clock. Gen. Biploy, who superintended the movements of the troops which arrived on the scene at about that time, ordered seve ral buildings on the route of the conflagra t'd! to be blown up. After some delay the order was executed, but not before the theater, Loyd’s coach factory of/pcsito the express office, the old Executive building, and all the bouses from this point to Queen street, had caught fire, and were destroyed. At about four o’clock the wind changed the direction of the flames toward Broad street. Soon after St. Andrew’s Hall took fire, and subsequently the Cathedral, the spire of which tell shortly after 5 o’clock. Tbe fire made a clean sweep through the city, making its track from East By to King street. The Charleston Courier, of the 13th inst , gives a list of between 200 and 300 sufferers, and says that the loss is estima ted at trom $5,000,000. to 7,000,000. Five churches were destroyed, viz : The Roman Catholic Cathedral, St. Peter’s Episcopal Church, the Cumberland Street Church, the Methodist Church and the Circular Church. Mr. Russell, at whose factory the fire originated, thinks that it must have been occasioned by an incendiary or by the negligence of the negroes. The Mills House is only slightly dam aged. The Charleston Mercury says fifty-seven buildings were destroyed by the fire. —Senator Hale’s resolution, instructing the Judiciary committee to inqu.re into the expediency of abolishing the Supreme Court, was, on motion of Mr. Collamer, amended so as simply to refer all portions of the President’s Message on that subject te that Committee. —Mr. Seward favors a plan for co’oniz ing the slaves of rebels. From Missouii. Gen. Halleck, the commandant of the department of the Missouri, has issued an important order in reference to matters there. All rebels and all who aid the enemy are to be arrested, and their pro perty confiscated and sold ; those feun'd in disguise as pretended loyal citizens are to be shot ; rebels who comii.i hos ilit'es will be punished according to the rules of war, destitute loyalists, who have been driven from their h< ines by the rebels, are to be quartered in the houses, and fed and clothed at the expense of the Secessionists, These are stringent measures but the con tumacy of the Missouri rebels renders them absolutely necessary. We have intelligence from Missouri that Gen. Pope has been assigned to the com mand of the National troo{ s between the Missouri and Osage rivers. Ibis is a very important command, and embraces the largest portion of the army taken to Springfield under Gen. Fremont. Price, at last accounts, was still south of the Osage, and believed to be losing more men from desertion than he was gaining in answer to his recent prosy proclamation. We have a rumor from Richmond, by way of Memphis, that be has been superseded in bis command of the Missouri rebel army by Gen. Heath, of Virginia. Rands of Price’s men are roving about the State, committing depredations and outrages in every direction, —The Charleston Courier, of the 9th, says that on Wednesday last a detachment jof the Beaufort artillery, consisting of twenty-two men, passed over to the island and visited Beaufort. There were no signs of the enemy either on land or water.— Our men then proceeded to the work of destruction. The chief object was to de stroy the crops of cotton and provisions on I am Island, which being near the enemv, was crowded with negroes who had flock- I ed there to escape from the control of their j owners. Owing to the want of boats, this object was but partially effected— 700 bales of cotton and 700 bushels of corn : wer e burnt on Dr. Thomas Fuller’s plant ation. Returning to Battery plantation, i fhe work of destruction was resumed.— ; The torch was successively applied to the j cotton of two other plantations, and the contents of the five barns were emptied, j and consumed ; seventeen crops, amount- I ing to nearley 4,000 bales, were thuseffeo j tually removed from tbe fangs of the des i troyers. —Judge Trumbull will shortly introduce | a bill reorganizing tbe Supreme Court, on the basis of population. The New England States, New York and Pennslvania, em bracing ten millions, will remain as now, : with three judges, viz ; Clifford, Nelson, I and Grier.

The Western States, including Missouri, and enibraeing ten and a half ! millions, will have three new Judges.— i Kentucky and Ohio will be one Circuit; ; Hlnois, Indiana, Michigan, and Southern l Wisconsin another Circuit ; and Minnesota, j lowa, Missouri, and Kansas another. The Pacific States will remain as before, under an independent Circuit Judge. The mail brings the intelligence of a horrible mas. l acre at Fort Stanton. On the approach of the Texans to that post in the summer, all the citizens in the vicinity fled to the settlements, leaving their homes, crops and everything else behind. After the Texans abandoned the place, the Ap ache Indians took possession and had com mand of all the country around. A party numbering twenty men, determined to re-visit the neighborhood and obtain what they could of their remaining crops, when the whole number fell into the hands of the savages, and were brutally murdered. —The Quartermaster General of Indiana announces that no more donations are : needed; and in many instances boxes of | clothing have been ruined by the breaking j of bottles of wine, jellies, preserves, etc., that were packed in them. —Mr. Stew art, residing near Mount Ver ! non, lowa, has manufactured 1,500 gal ; lons of sorghum syrup, of the best quality, this season and Mr. Gibson, of the same place, about 1,900 gallons.
