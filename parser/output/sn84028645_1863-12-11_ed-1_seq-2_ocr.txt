DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. I transmit tte seond sntinal isport of tl Commissioner of tbe Dapinuieut of Agrlcn tnrs, atkiog your attention 10 tbe developmec in that vital interest ol tbe nation. THE REBELLION AND EMANCIPATION. When Congress assembled a year ego, t' war had already lated Eearlv twerty miatb and there bid been many oor fl otfl. both on lot I and soa, with varying results. Tbe rebfllli had been prersed btck into reduced limits; y tbe tone of pobl 0 fee.Iog and opinion, at boo end abroaJ, was not satisfactory. With oth signs, tbe popular elecllms, then Inst past, I dioa'ed nceasiness among ourselves, whi amid much tbat was cold and menaoing, II kindest words coming from England were p tered in scoents oi pity tbat we were too bli I to surrender. Our orumerce was tuffVrii greatly by a few armed vessel?, bnilt npon S' furnished from foreign shores, and we we threatened with such additions from tbe sao ' quarter ae would sweep onr trade from the re and rme onr blockade, w e nad railed to ell from European Governments anything bope 1 npon theeutjeat. Tbe Emancipation Proclam tion which waa Issued iu September was runnii - its assigned period 10 tbe beginning of toe nr year A moctn later, tne noai proclimatli came, Inc'nding the announcement that oolor men of suitable cotdltion wou'd be reoelv ' Into tbe war service. Tbe polioy of emanelp lion and of tbe employment of black eoldlr gave to the future a new aspect, abont wbl. bopea, fears, and doubts contended in nncerlai oor 11 it, acoording to our political system, as matter of clril almiuiatration. Tbe Gere Government bad no lawful power o iffti emanclpa'lon la any State, and for a long tin It bad been boped mat tne rebeilnn oould b suppressed without resorting t It as a miltla meau e it waa an ine wane aeemed possm- ble that necessity fct It might come, and th if it ebouid, tbe crisis of tie contest won' then be presented. It oime, as eiorc'.edj was followed by dark and doubtful dayi E'even months baring been pssied, we at permitted to take another review. Tbe re: bordere are pressed still farther back, and -the complete opening of the Mississippi rivei tbe country dominated over by the rebellion i divided into dls Intt parts. Tennessee at ' Arkansas have been 10 aubstintially oleared t tbe Insurgents' control snd ltfloenoe; and tb cltliena in each, and owners of slaves, and a vooatea of euvtrr at tbe beg'nnice of the r bel loo, now deolare openly fer emancipation I tbeir respective mates Uf ttoie Utates ni In eluded in tle Emancipation Prsolamatloi Maryland and Mlesocri, neither of wbiob, year ago, would tolerate any restraint npon Ibe ex tension of slavery into tneir territories, onl dispui e now as lo tbe best mode of removing 1 from within their oen limits. Of tho-e wb were slaves at the beginning of tbe rebellior fully one hundred thonsand are row in tb United States military service, about one bat of which number actually bsar arms In tb ranks, thus giving tbe dcubie advantage t taking much labcr from the insurgent oausr and supplying the places which otherwise mm be filled with so many white men. Sj far e tested, it is difficult to say tbey are not a cot 1 soldiers as any. No servile insurreotion, c. tendency to violence or cruelly, has marked th measures or emancipation aod arming tbi blacks. Tbeso measures have been inuob die cn-eed fn foreign countries, and, eotempcrtry witn soon ducussioos, ins tone ot puniio sent! meat tbere is muoa improved, ins stme measures have beeo folly discussed, supported, oritloised and denounced, and the result of tbe annnsl eleotlons Is highly ecc-nragicg to loose whose special daty 11 is to bear tbe country through Ibis great trial; tbuj we have tbe reckoning. Tbe orisis whioh tbreatsoed to divide Ibe Union Is past. PLAN TO RESTORE THE UNION—THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION TO STAND. Looking now to the ptesent and future, and with reference to tbe resumption of Ibe nation antborlty within tbe Stales wherein that au thority has beeo suspended. I have thought fil issue a proclamation, a copy ol whioh la here with traismitted. On elimination of this proclamation, it will appear, ae Is bslieved, am justified by tbe Constitution; True; tbe form of an oath is given, but 00 man is ooeroed ' take it. A manisoily premised atardonln oaae hi voluntarily takes the oatb. The Con- Btiiution authorise the Execntive to granl it , sueb terms aa are fully established by Iu- diolal snd otber authorities. I; is also proffered tbat if, in man; ot the States named, a seat of Government shall be, in the mode prescribed, np, snob Government shall be recognised guaranteed by tbe Uuited States, and tbat nnder it tbe State shall, on subscribing to lbs constitutional conditions, be protected sgaioat invasion and domestic violence. Tbe constitu tional obligation of tho United States to guar antee to every Slate in the Union a republican form of Government, and to protect the State lha oasa as stated, - Is explbll and full ; why tender tho benefits of this provision to a State Government set np la this par ticular wejl This section of the Constitution contemplates a oaae where n the element with in a State, favorable to Republican Government tbo Union, may be too feeble (or an opposite hostile element external lo, and even with in, the Bute, and suoh are preolsely tbo oases with which we are now dealing Aa attempt guarantee and protect a isrlsei State) Gov to as ernmeot, constructed In whole or In preponder - atioff part from the very element rtgainee wbea hostility and violenoe It Is to be pro ected, Is simply absurd. There mnst be a test by which to separate opposlrg elements, eo ss tn build only from tbe sound, and tbat tost is a auffio ent and liberal one, wt ioh aooepts a sound whoev er will make a swern recantation of bis former nnsoundnt'ss But If it be prorer to require as a test of ad mission to tbe political body, an oalh of alle giance to the Constlintlon of the United States and to tbe Union nnder II, wby not also lo tbe lawe and proolama'ions in regard to il tverj ? Those laws aod proclamations were eoaotrd and put forth for tbe purpose of aiding In the suppression of tbe rebellion. To give them the fullest eQeot there bad to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my juc'gment tbe; have aided, sod will further aid, tbe cause for wbloh ti-ey were enaoted. To give up tbla principle wojld be not on'y to relirquish a lever of pow er, but would also be a cm el snd astounding breach of faltb. I may add, at tbi 1 point, that while I remain In my present position, I shall not artetrpt lo retraol ormodidytbe Euaocipa tlon Proclamation, nor shall I return lo slavery any person who Is made frse by the terms of the ploolamatlon. or by any act of Congress. For tbese, aod other reosoos, it Is tbonght belt tbat the support oi these persons shall be in cluded in tbe oalh, and it U believed tbe Exo ntlve may lawfully claim it in return lor par don, and tbe restoration of pro'eoted tights wbloh be has a dear constitutional power to withhold altogether, or giant upon the terms whioh be shall deem wisest for the publio Inter est. It should be ubif-ved, aleo. toil this part of tbe oatb is subject to tbe modifying and ab roeatine nowtir of If aisWtiou end supreme ia- diclal decision.

It Is boped tbat the already dsrplj-t 111 cted people In those Slates may be somewb moie ready to give np tbe cause of their iffl otion, and to this extent this vital matter is life to themselves, while no power ol tbe Nst'ioaal Executive to preveat an abuse Is abrldgod by this p-c position Tbe suggestion In the prcoltmatioa as to maintaining the poii io-il frsmework of the States on what Is oiled r OJiietr notion, Is made In tbo tope tbat It may do gnoi without harm It will liivor labor, and avoid great oontualon But wby any proclamation tow op n ttesu' jel?

This may bring tbe m ti aet sooner tban they otherwise woull. Tbe objection to a prematu-e presentation of a plan by tbe National Exeoutiee, too'lsta In tbe danger ol committals iu points wbich could be more eafely left to lurther developments. Care baa been taken to eo shape tbe document as to avoid embarrassment from t lis source. Iu giv ing that, on certain terms, certain classes will be pardoned, witn tbeir runts rcrt.red, it Is 10 said tbat other cissies, on ether terms, will never be included. 1.1 saying tbat a recooiiroo tica will be accepted, If presented in a specified way, l! Is not said tbat it will be eroepted In no Other way. Toe movemenie by am 10 aotiflu lor emai.olption, not Included la tbe Emtooi pitioi Proclamation, are matters of profound gratuiation; and, wbile I do not repeat whit I have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this subject, my general views and feel-njs retrain ucooanged, and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding theae Important steps to tbe great oc.nfuaimt.tion. lo the midst of otber cares, however Impnr tact, we most not lose eigbtot tbe fact thai the war power Is still our main relianoe. To that power alonsoan we lock ye , for a t me, to give confidence to the people in cjd ested regttns, that the Insurgent tower will not again over run tbem. Until that confidence shall be es tabliebed, little can be done anywhere for what is called reconstruction, ilenoe, our cbietest care must still be directed to our army and cavj, who have thus far borne tbeir batd r part so nobly and well; aod It msy be esteem el fcr. unite that, in giving tbe greatest ef ficiency to tbtlr iodiepensaiiie arms, we do aso honorably encourage galliot mea, from oom mander to sentinel, who compose tbem, and to whom, more tban a:l o hers, tbe world mo't stand indebted, for the home of free dom, disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged, and perpetcaled.
