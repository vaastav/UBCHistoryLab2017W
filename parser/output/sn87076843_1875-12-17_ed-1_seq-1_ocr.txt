Resolutions were adopted declaring that a large class of persons exist in Ohio who properly belong to the vagrant class, and who live by preying upon the public; that this Is a growing evil that can only bo eradicated by fur nishing employment to this class of such a character as to make their labor remuner ative ; to this end the plan of establishing work-houses in all the cities and towns sufficiently largo to maintain them is recommended, and additional legislation by which any district composed of one or more townships may be authorized to erect such houses, or to form chain-gangs, is to be asked for; that magistrates be given authority to arrest all vagrants and, upon conviction, to commit them to these work-houses, which may also bo used for persons convicted of petty offenses; that this system of work-houses to be effective must extend over the whole State ; that the furnishing of free transportation to tramps from one point to another is disapproved of ; that after work-houses are established private charity to vagrants should entirely cease, and mat the proper authorities should be authorized to employ persons committed to tho work-houses on the pub lic highways or at other labor outside the work-house.

The following extracts are taken from ex-Senator Henderson's speech before the jury in the Avery case at St. Louis, and contain tne language oucnsive to tne rres ideut, and for which the latter, unani mously supported by the Cabinet, ordered his discharge as assistant in prosecuting the whisky cases at St. Louis: What right had Babcock to go to Douglass to Induce him to withdraw his agents? Doug-lai-a waa placed in his position ta aee that the revenue laws of the Government wore proper. ly enforced. What business, then, naa uougiasa With him? When anofliclal goes into office ne should ne lree ana lnaepcnacni oi an in fluences except that of law, and if he recog nizes anv other master tbon this Government is tumbling down. What right has the Pres. ldent to interfere with Commissioner Doug lass In the proper discbarge of his dutiea, or with the Treasurer? None; and Douglass showed a lamentable weakness of character when he listened to Bubcock's dictates. He should either have Insisted that his orders, as Uey existed, be carried out, or should have realtrned hla office. Now whv did Douglass bend the supple binges of the knee and permit anv interference oy me rresiacni r i uis waa Douclasa' own business, and he stood re spouBible for It under bis official oath. He was bound to listen to no dictation from tho President. Babcock. or anv other officer, and it was his duty to see that that order was carried out or to resign. Would that we had officials who possessed more of that sterner stuff of which the office-holders of olden times wore made. Why do they not leave their offico when they cannot remain there honors blv? Is it to continue that because a man holds an offico at the hands of another he is to be a bonded slave?

You never heard her snouting ana laughing ana frolicking as you nappy children love to do. No. Maggie and her mother did not knew mucn about bright or pleasant things, either. They just lived on in the small back rooms, where there was always work, work, work, and never any sun shine, save the dear love between them, aud never any play. Maggie's little hands had learned very early to help mother, and her feet to save her steps. They just lived on and never anything nappeneu to inein ; oniy sometimes wnen they wero alone and the shop-door was shut they would smile dear, loving smiles at each other and say a few tender words.

All the blessed Christmas days when me wnoio woria beside seemed gay as larks they worked away just as usuiil, only mere were more souuer smiles between mother and child when the shop-door was shut. Snip always very obstinately stitched away the whole day. Maggie had a tender, momeriy heart, and the one great longing of all herjittle life had been lor a doily, and tins she had never had What do you think of that, little girls with a dozen, and a new darlintr every year? Once when she was very tiny her mamma maae ner a rag-uaoy, a poor lit tle affair, but site loved it dearly.

Poor Magi And now the blessed time had come again; to-morrow would be Christmas, dear old Christmas, come for everybody but tho Snipstitchets. There waVftever any stockings hung by their chimney, never any " merry Christ mas" shoutings in the morning. Already were shops and stores glittering with beautiful things. You would know the glad time was near by the bright faces and big bundles, by the happy ring of the children's voices, by the spicy greenery here, there and everywhere. Little Mug sat on Hie shop door-stone or stood with her face pressed against tho window watching it all with asad face, Once she turned to her mamma and asked, "Is there Christmas in all tin; world?" " Yes, dear." "Aud not auy for us." There waa a gre d choke in her throat, but she suw the puiu in mamma's eyes, ami like a brave girl bhu put ou a suillu and went on wondering If there was a Christmas in heaven. There was a toy store not far down the street, nnd often Maggie, with her little shawl over her head, would stand before the great window filled with wonderful things. This was a great delight to her; she would sometimes quite forget herself nnd imagine them all hers. Mamma and she had said nothing nbout dollies this time; they felt there was no hope. Tills day Maggie had gone to tho big window to bpo the splcnd itl Christmas toys, and oh, those dolliesl how she longed just lor tho least, the poorest and meanest, of all those many beauties. As she stood looking so eagerly, so wistfully, her father came by. Ho spoke sharply, "Mag, what aro you doing here r" She started. "Oh! tho beautiful doll ies, father; seel" " Go home," said ho, sternly, " nnd don't be staring In the street." Ho she fled again to the loving mother's arms, even this pleasure denied her I Poor little girl, she was sorely troubled that day. After dinner she was in the shop; the door was pushed open and a peddler with a basket on his arm filled with toys came in. He held out a gay little doll and said : " Buy a nice pretty doll for lee tie meeset" She sprung forward with outstretched hondB and eager eyes, say ing: "Oh, father!" Snip turned angrily to the man and shouted : " Away with you ; get out of my shop with your trash!" and then ho said harshly to the little girl standing with the light all gone out of her face aud with quivering lip: "Hand me the gooso nnd go." You know the Iron vised by tailors for pressing their seams is called a gooso. I suppose because it used to be n.ade with a crooked handle looking something like the neck and head of a goose. Mag hand ed up the Iron with trembling hands to her father nnd ran quickly out, witli her little soul full of grief nnd disappointment. She handed up the goose and something more, for on the hot iron had fullcn a great tear and was hissing there. Snip heard it nnd saw it. The goose was very hot; he set it down for awhile, when oh! such a wonderful thing happened. Sud denly it began to stretch up a long neck and mice bill. There was no mistake higher and higher it came. A great body began to grow, ana huge gray wines to soread out. and ugly red legs and f.ct stretched down. What could It mean! Would it never stop? It grew more and more and larger and larger; it fairly towered above him; he lelt gid dy and frightened; he tried to push it away, but could not move it; lie was trembling from head to foot; he tried to scream, but could nuke no sound. I he crent eray thine completely overpowered him; two shining eyes seemed piercing nun turotigu; men tne uwuu uiouiu opened and gave a terrible hiss right in his ear. It seemed he would go mad ; but it went on hiss-hiss-hiss, louder and loud er, rieht through his brain ; never such a sound before. It opened its mouth wider and wider; he thought tho monster would swallow him, but it only hissed forth 1 Shame, shame, shame, selfish wretch ; hiss, wretch, hiss-hiss! Why don't you make your wile and child happy? hiss- A'-niss!" and there poured torth from the great, red mouth names ot living nre, an upon mm. lie gave niraseii up to die. He cried aloud, " Oh! oh! oh!" and woke up. You see. while he waited, Mr. Snip stitchet had leaned his head against the wall and took a short nap. He had a bit of a niehtmare. too. onlv it was in tho dayttnio. I Buppo&s he had not slept two minutes; you know it takes but a very short time for a very long droam. there was some reason ler this dream : First was a guilty conscience, next that sad tear of reproach hissing on the iron, and next the coat he was making for Dea con Jones had slipped down upon the hot goose and was scorching and burning iu a ruinous manner. o that waa the reason the dream-goose hissed nnd spit forth fire. Snip did not like it, and ho liked it less as the time went on. Do what he would he could not keep that gray thing out of his mind; it kept hissing" in his ear, " Shame, shame, shame!" all the time he heard the horrible voice shrieking 'wretch!" He tried to forget it tried to think of something else in vain. The hiss-hiss, sliame-shame, wrsteh-wretch made tho guilty conscicnco say, a good many times: " Why don't you make your wife and child happy?" wnen evening came and ho went into the buck rooms it was still the same. The sounds seemed singing in his soul, nnd the hissing of that sorrowful tear. He sat gloomily over the fire as usual; out side all was joy, tramping feet, jolly laughter, tingling bells; all the world happy mil me bnipstitclicls. nut lie " wasn't going to give in to any such non sense." Once he passed by Mae's little bed and heard a lone sieh. and saw clothes-pin doll hugged up in her arms hlss-lnss" ana in the comer sat silent ly his Bad, tired wife, looking wearily into the nre. now rosy and cliceriul ana well she had been when he brought her to those small rooms " shame, shame!" He could endure it no longer; ho started up. " I am going out, Mary," he said. 1 may bo late." lie was late so lute sho grew anxious. When he camo she was still bending over the fire. She had been thinking happy old days at homo with brothers una sisters ; there were tears ou her failed f .ice. Snip walked straight up to her aud lttid package on her lap. Sho looked up in great surprise and exclaimed: " Vhy, whv! Whul, what " "Mary," he said, kindly, " I am going to try nunene and see what comes of it. It is only a little Christmas present tor you, dear wife." Was she dreaming? She neither moved nor spoke, lie ttxik her hand and said : " Untie it; let us see if we, too, can have a little of the Inn." Slowly, wonderingly she undid the strings and the wrappings; then she unfolded Bolt, warm shawl which she so much needed. She held it up and examined ana reaching out to her husband said : " Oh, John, how good and kind!" laid her head down on his shoulder aud hud good, happy cry, very different from those other tears. Then she went on unrolling the papers, and there was a handsome doll dressed iu the very latest fashion. Sho could hardly believe it; it seemed too good to bo true. I do believe the poor woman was as rejoiced over that doll baby as any child in all the land. " Oh, this is best of all," she said; "it is beautiful, and she will be so glad, and am so happy." " Well, wen," thought nip, as looked at her face, already so diflerent, smiling and animated. He was begin ning U find out tho good of "nonsense." The next morniug they took away dressed. up clothes-pin and luid the new dolly in its place, then watched what sho would do. When she first opened eyes she started back, rubbed them and did not believe. Then she slowly reached her hand and touched it and, all trembling with excitement, she culled out: "O mother, mother, come quick!" They ran to her; her face was quite pule. her eyes wild; it was really painful see her. " O mother, see, sue ! Whose is it?" There was great pain In Snip's heart be took lieriu his arms and said: "Merry Christmas, Maggie; that father's Christmas nreseut to vou." She could not understand it at all. Her mother stood wiping her eyes with corner of her upron ; Mug looked ut father with wondering eyes, then ut doll. She took it up timidly, suw firetty eyes that would open and shut, and is feet with cunning shoes upon them. She fell of its real hair, glossy and curl- ing; then hugged it to her bosom with great content ; then laying It down she threw her arms around her father and said : " I do love you so, dear father!" From that moment Snip never heard an other hiss. Something came Into his heart then that had never been Ihcro lic- foro, something of love and tenderness; already a new light of feeling was In his face. Ah, ha! so this is what comes of " nonsense," Is it? What a Christmas mom was that! Shout, happy children ; ring, merry bells; shino as bright as you will, gracious Christmas sun; through all your journeying from your far-coming to your far-going you will not shine upon a happier child than Maggie Snipstitchet. It is another face looking from the win dow to-day a smiling face with a doll's face close beside. And to Mag and her mother, nnd to Snip, too, the world is a changed world, full of pleasantness and good cheer; nil bccatiBO of a little mm sense. Hut I hnvo not told yon all. A big basket was brought, and they went quite wild witli the unpackingof so many goodies; but chief of all did Snip hold up In triumph a fine, fat goose. "There," said he, " that is for dinner!" Tills gave Mrs. Snip quite a start, for she knew that coosc must he cooked as never eoose was cooked before. While sho was busy with that, Mg was handing up green boughs and holly branches witli scarlet berries, while her father hung them all about, until she thought the little plain room like fairy land. Snip never went near the shop, only to look in once; shook his fist at his innocent goose and said: " I'll got tho better of you; another goose than you will hiss before night." Ho actually dressed in his Sunday clothes and took Maggie a long walk in the clear air, nnd told her about " once when he was a littlo boy." Her heart was so light her feet would not stay on the ground at all, but kept skipping and dancing all the time. Finally all the running to the oven and the watching and fearing was over the goose was done, all nicely brown, and dinner was ready. Just as they were go ing to sit down, Snip drew his wife and Maggie to him, and there were tears in nil their eyes ns he said: " After all I guess nonsense Is the best thing, and here after we will sec what Christmas can do fonts;" and Mrs. Snipstitchct said fer vently: " I am very grateful to our God." Maggie's face shone, nnd Snip's was so smooth and smiling you would have thought his own eoose had been rubbed over it. Mamma looked still a little anx ious ; she was not just sure how the goose would turn out. Snip plunged in the fork and the hot steam came hissing out nil savory. " Ha, ha!" said he, " hiss as much ns you will ; who's afraid?" And when there was a nice tender slice on each plate, and as Maggie said: " Such a lot of gravy!" and when Snip declared " it was tho very best gooso he ever tasted in Ills life," tho mother, too, was quite content nnd smiled ns brightly as Mag herself; and and oh tuchn good lime) Talk about Christmas! why, from thatduy to this the neighbors say: " Of all the peo ple in the world, that Snipstitchct family do make the most of Christmas and al ways have gnoe for dinner." Hearth and Home. How to Send Packages Through the Mails. a a a a so I ne so to as " An Old Postofncc Clerk," who has for years held n responsible position in the newspaper department of the Chicago PoBtollloo, furnishes tho following useful hinU for the benefit of those who may de sign using Undo Sam's mails to convey Uhnstmas or other presents to absent friends : It is au old story, told and told again. hut for all that my observation leads mo to kuow that it has been told to very little purpose. You are goiug to mail some friend a Christmas present; very good; this is commendable, but don't choose any trail articles liable to Injure other mail- matter by being broken, for, however well secured, the enormous pressure mail-bags are subjected to wvi crush them, licsidcs, it is not lawful. Any other article that will weigh less than four "pounds, tie se curcly with strong twine (not thread, as many do), in a good stout paper or strong box in such a manner that the Postoffice clerk may examine without destroying the wrapper; you need not expose the goods only leave it so that it can be readily opened. Do not write on that little mitten, " For Charley," or on the pin-cushion, " To Emma," or upon the cover ol your box, " A Merry Christinas from Mother." or in that book, " Christ mas from Pa." If vou do. you will cause your friend to pay letter postage, and oc casion bud feelings all around. Don't think that you can write a line and hide it away in this book, or that cover, for I tell you those boys are sharp, and will find it, no matter how cleverly concealed. Next comes the addiess; write this with ink plainly; if you cannot do this, ask somo lriend to do It lor you, in form as tot lows : Joun Smith, Esq., . Chicago, Cook Co., 111. If to a city, give street and number when known, and if to the care of any other party, so write plainly at the left of the address. Now many will add to this, thinking to assist tho I'ostoiiicc clerk and prevent ex amination, the words: "A Buok," " Aler climulUe," "No Writing" or, " Return if not called for to ." Yes, you do as sist the clerk by doing this, for it saves him the trouble of an examination. He immediately charges it letter postage, as the law compels mm to uo; so, my lriend don't do it. Now, weigh your package, and for each ounco attach a one-cent stamp; de liver it to your Postmaster, and your work is done, and rightly done. You may rest assured that, in the natural course of events, your friends will be made glad without anuoyance or expense. ru may suy mat you cannot man more than ono present at a time, as the friends receiving them could not designate to whom each belonged without a previous letter describing each article sent, thus destroyiujr the pleasurable surprise so desirable. It you win pay pur ticular attention I will tell you now to overcome this ouloctiou nay, even add to the pleasure, as it will open up fond anticipations. Pin to each article a slip ot paper on which is marked a number having previously written a letter, saying that you have mailed a package and that No. 1 is for ma. No. 2 for pa, No. 8 for baby, etc., etc. our friends will receive the letter and will wonder what Nos. 1, 2 or 3 can consist of. Suppose you wish to inform your friend who sent the present at the time no received it, men why not in close your photograph or ono of your printel curds? These tilings you may do lawiuny. I have endeavored to speak plain and trust that all will clearly understand, that I may have less occasion to rate up your coming uuridtmas presents tnciebum not desiring you to sutler but law is law Chicago aventng Lamp. is the her tho its Archdeacon Denlson said, not long since, that in his own church he never preachod, or allowed his curates to preach, more than ten minutes.
