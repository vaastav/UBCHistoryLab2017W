The District's Interest Debt. Controller Downey's decision that Secretary of the Treasury has 110 i>o to reimburse the United States dire from local funds in his care for the 1 i riot's share of the interest on the > bonds for the years IS77 and 1S7S. w out legislation, supplements his ruling last January, in which he held that United States lias, since 1S78, b obliged to pay half of the interest on entire funded debt. Tl had been < covered in the course of a long ; expensive inquiry that, owing to faulty bookkeeping of the United Sta ilie advances of money by the fed? government to pay the District's half this interest for two years had ne been refunded. Now the controller lares that unless and until Congr grants spc iiie authority The Secretary the Treasury eann*?t refund the umo r<> the United States. This decision strengthens the com tion of the District that the li.'ited Sta . ssuined deiinitely and deliberately 1 liu- burden of National Capital mail a me when in 1S7S it adopted an orga a t tor the District government. ontrollor in both of his formal rulii so regards the legislation of thirtyami one-hull" years ago. Under th there can be no revival of the fori . h-im that the District owes the I'ni States that part of the sinking fund the retirement of bonds which was c iributed by the federal government i itr the half-and-half clause. There mains now only the equitable conside tion of wiiether Congress should reqti t.!i? refunding of an interest charge U77-S which has stood all these ye; without claim until very recently. Cor thirty-six years Uncle Sam has I this nuittcr exclusively in his hands, a has treated the transaction of the int est on the 3.65 bonds as disposed of the compromise settlement of 1S7S, wl the District's bankruptcy was adjust There has never been a question cf pr of su?*h a clearing adjustment ui lately, when interests avowedly hostile the organic act became active and f reted out details of federal bookkeep which after the lapse of years technics show ed a District Indebtedness. 1 United States, having full charge of books and of the appropriations, acce ed the account as closed. Now. deny that the statute of limitations applies the District's favor, it is sought collect a claim that, under every c jjideration of equity, should be regar< ua outlawed. If the municipal expenditures betwi 1847 and 1S7S are to be readjusted on half-and-half basis, all the items of t account should be stated and conside: and not merely the item of interest in 3.6.> bonds. The Board of Trade inu ?. ipal finance committee has shown c? clusively that in such full accounting the four years the United States paid 1 than half of the municipal expenses, ? that on an equitable readjustment would be indebted to the D.strict. If old claims and equities prior to 1 ; re to be revived in favor of the Uni States, then they must also, in ccnsi ency and fairness, be revived in favor Washington. If the District of today to be held responsible for any neglec debts of the District be ore the act settlement it must also have the ben Io: oiti Washington's unsatisfied equit and partly unpaid credits.

There are details, but the conversation must li been interesting. Mr. Smith bad vi and information it was worth the P idexst's while to consider, while President had views and explanati of equal importance to Mr. Smith, probability is that the New York yation will be affected?and maybe the better?by the visit. If at all, the better. The situation, from democratic point of view, could no worse. The White House has been callct fool's paradise." The occupant, w in one way very powerful, is in ano way very helpless. He is forced lean upon others for much informa about men and their political strei and relation. He has a great many pointments to make; and the presi upon him in some cases is heavy. This makes his calling list long, nearly everybody wants something, himself or a friend. Jollying the Pi dent is not only a rule, but rega as a necessity. Ho beaxs only pn lR, I and lacks the time, and maybe the dis-Ito t ' position, to discount it properly. Any tr*ci man so placed would be a marvel if he of 1 ?? did not now and then obey the wrong In i "steer" as to patronage. Even with to u the best intentions, he is bound at beei 914 times to make mistakes. The New York controversy is of the istir .^0p spoils variety, and therefore the fuller is a of danger. The President is expected in f to place the patronage at his disposal in bay. where it will do his party the most beer good. Tf it were a matter only of find- own ing a competent lawyer of good repute to represent the government in that ,v\* federal judicial district there would be able * no difficulty. But the nominee, in nddi- tere tion to ability and character, should be jtini acceptable to the regular party organ- of a i per izatlon, and possess more or less of a H4? i "Pul1" himself. In office he should be ,pj. each I able to strengthen his party within the ject | zone of his service. nat{ There is where the shoo pinches. The 'd: New York reeulars contend that the ^ President lias obeyed tlie wrong re?r. steer"; that he has been persuaded to ' ? make war on the men who made him, ;l 01 P0*1 and that If he persists in his course he )eel _ will injure the New York democracy, t and through it the national democracy. ! :0:1 id From their point of view, the President ; >r*t? himself suffer in the end if he does ding not turn from the irregulars to them. } It is not too late for the President to turn, although it will not be easy for him to execute the maneuver. He has : led so aggressively and successfully in the such matters since taking charge, it wer may irk him to accept even a mild re- 110 1 ctly buke. tr>_i Ma- 1 ,,, 1 ] a ne uu- The Philippines.

They will gom imt heard now with much respect. y\-\ These men profess, aud have mani- i?o t fested in office, sincere friendship for ^n le<j the Filipinos, and have made a study of tlieir conditions, capabilities and ^ needs.

Take January 1, in= 1915, as the day. in At that time the great nations were ? to ; all at peace. The struggle between c>n" Russia and Japan was at an end. The e east was as quiet as the west. Today both east and west are in ^ * een awful commotion. To a degree, Japan ^oul tl^e is a party to the European war.
