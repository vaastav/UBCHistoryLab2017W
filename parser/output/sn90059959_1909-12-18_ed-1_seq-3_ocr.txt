Eleven per cent is the amount of in crease in the cost of living during the last year. This figure represents th« average increase in cost commodities. Marked advances in the last year have taken place in breadstuffs, pro visions, livestock, hides and* leather and textiles. One of the noticeable effects of increased cost of living has been the forced demand of labor for higher wages. Wages, however, have not advanced In proportion to,the cost of living. The natural conclusion, and the only conclusion to be reached la that the workingmen and their fam ilies have been forced to a trifle lower standard of living. Dealing with wholesale prices, Brad street's shows that on December 1 the average price for ninety-six commodi ties stood at 9.1262 against 8.2133 on the same date last year. Here Is a price advance of a little over The Increases above dealt with re fer to the upward tendency In prices during the last year. To appreciate what a 11 per cent increase in the cost of living during the last year really means. It is necessary to recall that the cost of living In- 1907 aver aged 47!4 per cent more than in 1897. While protectionists deny that thn. high Dingley rates have more than it nominal connection with the increased cost of living, a comparison of food prices here and in England shows th«t while prices have advanced program," continued for.
