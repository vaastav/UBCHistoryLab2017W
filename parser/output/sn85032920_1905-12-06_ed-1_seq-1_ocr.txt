While the Army and Xavy football game today was probably one of the most exciting events ever played be tween the two institutions, it was sim ply a side show to the social football event of the season. Twenty-five thou sand saw the game. From all sections of the United States came spectators who ordinarily would not travel a score of miles to see a football game. 1'his was doubtless brought about by the fact that President Roosevelt was to be present. Xear the close of the first, half the Army got the ball-on the "Navys"30;' yard line on an exchange of kicks. Af ter a spiral gick by Howard, the West Pointers carried the ball over for a touchdown. A West Point player was responsible for the tie game. On an exchange of kicks within ten' minutes of the close of the game, the Xavy had the ball near the midficld. Howard sent a beautiful punt back to the West Point goal. As the Xavy clevon started down the field, an Army man was detected by Umpire Wrenn holding one of the Xavy. As a pen alty the ball was brought back and 

EXPLOSION iS LIVES OF 18 DIAMOND VHiLE, Wyo., Dec. 2 Eighteen miners lost their lives in an explosion late last night in the Dia mond Coal company's mine Xo. 1. It is believed that all were killed instant- What caused the disaster is not de finitely known, but the theory advanc ed by miners is that a "blown out" shot caused a dust explosion which wrecked the mine. The shock of the explosion was felt all over the town, rocking buildings so violently that their occupants ran into the open. Wives and children of tho entombed miners were among those who rushed to the shaft, and the scenes were most pa thetic. The explosio n occurred 1,100 feet under ground, and 3,000 feet from "tl-c mouth of the shaft. Every man in tbr- mine perished. STREET CAE MEN'S INCREASE.

The Xavy braced up af ter substitutes were sent in and car ried the ball over for a touchdown. Xorton kicked a goal. During the excitement incidental to the Xavy's touchdown President Roose- velt, who kept his eyes riveted on the game from the beginning, left his seat in the Army stand, accompanied by President Wilson of Princeton, the se cret service men, Secretary Loeb, and six policemen, and walked briskly from the grounds. The demonstration accorded the Pre sident, when ho entered the field and also the thunderous cheers which greet ed him between the halves as ho left his seat in the Xavy stand and walked across the gridiron to the Army stand were inunilely more hearty and spon taneous than those accorded to the com bined eleven. Tho President was accompanied on the trip by Mrs. Roosevelt. Among those who saw the game were Mrs. Grovcr Cleveland, J. P. Morgan, and former Secretary of the Xavy Morton. Mrs. Cleveland (ccupied a seat in the President's box on the Xavy side of the field. 

MISSILE HURLED AT TRAIN OF ESIDENT WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 As Pre sident Roosevelt's special train pass ed through north Philadelphia at 7:30 this evening en route to Washington, some unknown person hurled a mason's plumb through one of the windows. The implement was of iron and weigh ed about two and a half pounds. It fell at the feet of Major Webb Hays, son of the lato President Hayes, who was a passenger on the train. Fragments of the broken glass fell on Hayes, but he was not injured. Hayes was sitting at the window and his profile was not unlike that of Roosevelt. The President knew no thing of the matter until an hour later. Railroad officials are inclined to the belief that some boy threw the mis sile. ON IIS

In the Senate the routine program will be. followed. Senator Fairbanks will call the Senate to order. A com mittee win do appointed to call upon the President and inform him that the Senate is in session, and another committee will similarly advise the House. Should Senator LaFollette of Wisconsin be present the oath of office will bo administered to him. He is the only Senator to bo sworn in. Immedi ately after these formalities have been concluded tho Senate will adjourn un til Tuesday out of respect to the mem ory of Senator Piatt of Connecticut. Alexander McDowell, clerk of the House, will call that body to order at noon, and call the roll of those entitled to seats in the Fifty-ninth Congress. The oath of office will bo administered, raW the "drawing" of seats will tKen take place, the members standing be hind the rails until tho name of each is drawn from a box by a blindfolded page, .following custom, Representa tive Bingham, of Pennsylvania, the "father of the House," will first be allowed the privilego of selecting his seat. After tho election of House of ficers, committees will bo appropriated to wait upon the President, and upon the Senate, to advise both that the House is in session. The Democrats of the House assem bled in caucus late this afternoon, and selected John Sharp Williams of Mis sissippi, as minority candidate for Speaker, who thereby becomes the min ority floor leader. A fight was start ed on him toward the close of the last session, but it loll tlirougn owing to the refusal of Judge DeArmond of Missouri to oppose Mr. Williams' leadership. It is not expected that there will be any changes in the pat ronage of tho minority in the House offices.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 Federal control of foods, drugs, and liquors for tho purpose of securing their purity, is provided for in a comprehensive bill to be introduced in the Senate at an ear ly date by Senator Heyburn, Idaho. Tho jurisdiction of the government over these articles is declared in the measure when they become articles of interstate or foreign commrce, and a penalty of $500 and one year's im prisonment is provided for tho violat ors in the regulations set forth. TB PRESENT PURE FOOD BILL RESS Casson; doorkeeper, F. B. Lyon; post master, Joseph C. McElroy; chaplain Rev. Henry X. Couden. It is said also that there will be no changes in the minor offices, such as chief clerk, superintendent of the doc ument rooms, disbursing clerk, file clerk, and similar positions. All the officials in these places have given sa tisfaction, and there is no disposition to disturb them. There are a few changes in the small patronage occa sioned by retirement from Congress of tho patrons of the incumbents, but these arc not sufficient in number to cause any great scramble. The burning question with both old and new members of tho House is com mittee assignments. It is a question also that is causing Speaker Cannon to puff away at his cigar with a little more than his accustomed vigor. The Speaker finds himself obliged in a way to fill square holes with round pegs. Tho ways and means commit tee, of course, is the most troublesome, as well aslhe mosPimportant, There are too many revisionists on the com mittee now to suit tho Speaker. But every Republican member of the com mittee has been re-elected, and the custom is to reappoint all re-elected members. And that's where tho trou ble comes in. From a high protectionist viewpoint the ways and means committee is protection members of Vc committee are Xeedham of Califor:h, Boutell of Illinois, Hill of Connecticut, Curtis of Kansas, Grosvenor of Ohio, and possibly Watson of Indiana. It has been suggested that the equi librium of the committee could best be restored by replacing Mr. Tawney of Minnesota, who is a revisionist, by Mr. McCleary of the same state. Mr. McCleary is a stand-patter among stand-patters, and could be counted upon to "revise the tariff up wards," if revise at all. He is a stu dent, deeply versed in theory and fa miliar with schedules and conditions, and is said to be the one man, in Mr. Cannon's opinion, to put ginger into tho wobbly ways and means commit tee as at present constituted. But whe ther this or any other change will be made in the personnel of the commit tee is a matter to be decided later. High Honor for Tawney.
