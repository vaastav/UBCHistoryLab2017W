Briefly, the ground cover. .! in the message may .be outlined, as follows: The chief executive favoru the pos tal savings bank idea as suggested bar the postmaster general, and again urges upon congress the necessity of providing an elastic and emergency circulation. The hoarding of money is given a hard slam basic busi ness conditions at present being in better condition than ever before, the hoarding of money is held re sponsible for the recent financial stringency. One of the striking features of the message is contained in the sugges tion that the government set aside certain sums for the campaign ex penses of each political party. A good time for taking up the ques tion of tariff revision is immediately after the next election, is the presi dent's view. The abuse of the Injunction in labor disputes, and the anti-mHitar ism spirit are deplored. The anti trust law, the president states, is in need of revision, to the extent that only combinations that do harm to the general public sholl be prevented. The eight hour working day should be the goal toward which the country should bend every effort, and the government is urged to set an example in this respect. Further legislation along the lines of the em ployer's liability law is urged, and an income and inheritance tax should be established. Laws should be enacted so that railroads may engage in interstate commerce under certain conditions. The need of a uniform grain inspec tion system is pointed out. Former arguments in favor of agricultural and technical schools are reiterated and emphasized, p.nd the develop ment of Irrigation projects is com manded. Public land fences.are good and bad, the message declares, but all are illegal, and it is not right that all must, be ordered down without discrimination. Talk of the inexhaustible re sources of the country, especially in connection with the timber supply, is deemed foolish, and the presiden. would abolish all tariffs on forest products and says there is. needless waste in the process Of getting out lumber. Work on the Panama canal is re ported as going along satisfactorily. The establishment of ~a bureau of mines under the control and direc tion of^ the secretary of the interior 'is desired, also improvement by proper legislation of the ocean mail service. In treating of affairs concerning !the Army and-navy, the chief execu tive points out that the pay of of ficers and enlisted men should be in creased considerably and that en listed men should not be compelled to perform menial tasks, but such duties should be performed by a Service corps maintained for the pur pose. Four battleships appear to be -about the right number to add to the navy this. year. The Pacific cruise-should prove to be of (great educational value,, states .the presi dent.|g^ -s •*Mi Bead and Then Congress Hears it ••••.. Adjourns—Large Crowd' Present.

Compulsary arbitration. as a means of settling labor disputes is again recommended, -and the recent telegraphers' dispute is cited as case in pointy where such arbitration irpuld bare been "of great, help to the country at large.

Val ues in general are from 10 to 25c higher than a week ago and a very £0od clearance has been made. Receipts of hogs this week has not been much over half as large as week ago or a year ago and as a result the market has in a great measure recovered from the recent slumip. Monday was the lorf point of. the season, the -trading being all at .00 or.under, buit since then there has been a steady advance of about 40c and the market has taken, on something of its old -time activity.

ATTACK GOVERNOR CRAWFORD. Attempt to Make Capital of Gover nor's Hotel Bills While in Pierre. A report that Governor Crawford was running hotel bills at Pierre without authority received a con siderable circulation through the state -last week,, and the executive's enemies made much of the alleged discrepancy. In defense of Mr. Crawford's action the Press of Sioux Falls has the following to say on the subject. "It is well known that during the present year it has been very dfficult, if not impossible, to rent a suitable house in Pierre for the governor and family. Unless he should take his wife and five children to a hotel and board or buy a home, he*would be compelled to live in cramped and inconvenient quarters, subject to right of possession in case of sale. This is because of the fact that Pierre is, .and all summer has been, over crowded with people. "The state does not provide a house at the capital for the governor .to live in. Governor Crawford, on account of these conditions, has kept his family at the home in Huron. The question of whether or hot his expenses at the hotel, incurred while there exclusively on state business, is not properly allowable out of the appropriation .for his office, was re ferred to the attorney general upon the personal request of the governor himself. Some time ago the attor ney general orally advised the state auditor that the chaTge was a legal one against the appropriation as made. The whole amount is about forty dollars. "If the old machine is anxious to compare the governor's expense ac count with that of his predecessors more in detail, we promise the pub lic that the governor will not be the one who will suffer by the compari son."

CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA, DECEMBER 6, 1907, car to. the location of the fourth pier Car and men went down together in side the coffer dam, the fall killing Jones instantly. Larson got off with .badly wrenched foot, but Walker was less fortunate, sustaining a se vere facial wound and otherwise was badly used up. Information regarding the home or friends of the dead man has not as yet been obtained, although Inquiries to different cities have been sent by wire in an endeavor to locate rela tives or acquaintances. A coroner's jury consisting of George Avant, Ed Merchant and Joseph Otto made a trip to the bridge Tuesday on a special train and view ed the wrecked staging, previously having heard the testimony of several men employed at the bridge. Upon their return to the city a verdict stat ing Jones' death was due to the faulty staging was returned. AVANT TO WAR ON JAPS. Russians Get the Idea that America is After the Easterners—^Taft's Visit the Cause. According to the eastern dispatch es the American ambassador at St. Petersburg is spending much of his time these days explaining to eager Russians that they are not needed to help the United States whip Japan, owing to the non-existence of hostil ities between the two countries.. This idea and others just as ludicrous are said to be in circulation at the -Rus sian capital, on account of Secretary Taft's tour of that country. THE NEW TRAIN. Milwaukee Puts on New Service Last Sunday as Announced. As announced .last week, the Chi cago, Milwaukee & St. Paul installed their passenger train service Sunday, and now every evening a brightly lighted, vesttbuled train pulls out from alongside the Crouch Lines de pot, adding Its share to the bustle of our growing city. The train from the east gets into town about 6:30 a. m., and is sidetracked for the day just^ below the depot. Quite a numjber of Rapid Cityans have looked over the equipment, many of them expressing a particular desire to inspect the special sleeping cars the 'Milwaukee owns and operates, whose greatest bid for fame lies in the extra sized berths with which the cars are equipped. DENIES RAILROADS ARE POOR. They Can Afford to Reduce Passen ger Rates in the Opinion of the Ass't Attorney General. Assistant Attorney General Daughterty has made a return in the injunction proceedings instituted by the railroad of the state, to prevent the enforcement of a 2 cent pas senger rate, until the matter comes up 1 efore Judge Carland fo ra hear ing on the 17th of this month, when they will put forth their best efforts to make the injunction a permanent ono. The Assistant Attorney General in his presentation of the case, does not agree with the railroads in their con tention that rail traffic In South Da kota is unprofitable, but goes on to show a reasonable revenue derived from such sources for the past three years. Mr. Dougherty further holds that a lower rate will .be of great ben efit to the roads themselves in the way of creating new business. The matter is of .much importance to South Dakotans generally, and Judge Carl&nd's decision is awaited with much interest. BILL POSTERS DO BATTLE. Lead and Deadwood Members of the S of on in to Sill!

'v.tkw. ?Y St! THE POSTMASTER GENERAL REC OMMENDS TO CONGRESS THEIR ESTABLISHMENT Postmaster General Meyer Emplia sizes Need in His Report to Congress, That the postal savings bank idea has a warm supporter in Postmaster General Meyer, is a fact disclosed in his recent report to the sixtieth con gress now assembled In Washington. He believes the establishment such a system of banks would be of a great benefit to the country, not only as a imeans of instilling and fostering ideas of thrift in the Ameri can, but they would also prove an important factor In keeping a large percentage of the savings that are at present abroad, within the borders of this country. The report suggests that great sums of money are kept out of circulation through lack of confidence on the part of its possess ors who fear to deposit it in the banks, a state of affairs that would be .done away with to a considerable extent if the postal banks were in ex istence, in the opinion of Mr. Meyer. The postmaster general desires that authority be extended the in cumbent of his office to designate money order postoffices and certai' others as the occasion may require to receive deposits for savings ac counts in even dollars, making the minimum deposit $1.00, while the total amount on deposit for any one person must not exceed $500.00. It it is further suggested that a two per cent rate of interest be allowed on all savings, which may be with-' drawn at -any time, subject to certain regulations. To get the mtoney thus accruing back Into circulation, authoritly is asked to turn it over to such banks as are government depositories in the states where the deposits were made. Another improvement deemed cessary by the chief of the postal service is the establishment of a par cels post for packages originating on a rural route or at a distributing •postoffice, froim where delivery is made by a rural route carrier, the maximum weight for parcels to be eleven pounds. A better system of bookkeeping for the department, and the appointment of an official to a permanent position as deputy postmaster general or di rector of posts with a salary of not less than $10,000 per annum, who shall be as an expert adviser to the head of the department and from, the permancy of his position be able to secure a continuity of policy essen tial to the usefulness of the depart ment, are other moves that the post master general desires to bring about about as he believes them to be of the utmost Importance in aiding to place the postal service on an up-to date business basis. ri: Told in the Hills.

CITY COUNCIL. Streets and Walks Committee Order* .ed to Inspect Alleys In Which Sewerage Wds Laid. Lost Monday evening was the reg ular meeting night of the city coun cil and shortly after eight o'clock that body started in on the munici pal affairs that had accumulated since the previous meeting, with Mayor Emrlck in the chair, and the follow ing aldermen responding to roll call: Overpeck, ,Dodge, Thompson and Feigle. The minutes of the preceding meet ing were read and upon motion Oi Alderman Overpeck, seconded by Alderman Dodge, they were accepted and ordered placed on file. Before taking up the payment of bills against the city, Attorney Brown Mi behalf of his clients, J. P. McElroy & Son, asked that the sum of $76.50 be paid them from any money the Sampson-McConnell Company might uave due them, in compliance with an order made on the city by. the sewer building firm. As it was a matter of some -difficulty to state just what amount was due the firm until the alleys in which the ditch ing took place were declared in a satisfactory condition, the order was placed on file until the .streets and walks committee had passed upon the condition of the alleys and made their report to the council. Fire Chief McElroy made a re port on the condition of the fire hose owned by the city and upon his sug gestion that a quantity of it could be made serviceable by minor re pairs* the auditor was instructed to procure the necessary material to put the hose in good shape. The city fathers then passed upon the following bills which were order ed paid from the proper funds: The following bills were read and allowed on the various funds: Tom Sweeney Hardware Co., $6.85 W. H.

The auditor was' ordered to procure the samje from the Sioux City Boiler and Sheet Iron Pipe Co., that concern having,, given a- satisfac tory figure on the material. Expedients for the proper care of the waste water from the. reservoir nthe side of Hangman's Hill were discussed and the installation of an automatic valve appeared to be the proper remedy for abating the mln ature river that makes its way along St. Joe street in the upper, end of town. The light and water committe acting la conjunction with the mayor and auditor were empowered to make the necessary arrangements for se curing such a valve, on motion of Alderman Feigel, seconded by Alder man Thompson. Alderman Thomson reported that for various reasons the shelter or dered erected for the protection- of certain property belonging to the city had not been built. Upon inquiry it developed -that part of the material for which the house was to be con structed had been used, so the mayor was of the opinion that the city may be spared the expense of putting up the building for a while at least, to which the other members of the coun cil agreed. A statementcpf the quantity and! cost of rack used In macadamising certain streets ot the city during the past season was presented by Mayor iEmrlck.

ON THE FLIP OF A COPPER CHANGE IN AFFAIRS ARE TO BE MADE. Land Office Officials to be Changed —Burke for Register and Willsle for Reecoivor. Hinging'on the recent coin fliftpihg contest between Senators Gamble and Kittredge of this, state, there will In ill probability be a change or two in the personnel of the local land office staff in the near future. The selection of the man for reg ister at Rapid City fell to the lot of Senator Kittridge, who had the pres ent register, George Bennett in mind for the post. However, the appoint ment of the receiver fell into the hands of Senator Gamble who de sired Myron Wiilsie for the place/' which let Mr. Burke out. Mr. Ben nett was not satisefld with the turn affairs had taken arfd decided to withdraw in favor of -Burke and so informed Senator Kittredge, who will will tout doubt act accordingly and present the latter'B name for the office. Mr. Burke has been.connected with the land office since 1903, and will undoubtedly prove a worthy succes sor to Mr. Bennett. That gentle man, upon being freed from his gov ernmental connections, will devote his time to his. growing business af fairs. Mr. Bennett has made him self an enviable reputation' as regis-* ler,. and hosts of friends stand ready to testify as to his efficiency while In office.
