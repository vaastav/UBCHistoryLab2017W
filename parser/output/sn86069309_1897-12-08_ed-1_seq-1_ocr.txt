Disinclination to Vetoes FHIFND3 OF CUBA ARE STILL HOPEFUL WAsmNQToy Dec 7 Special The Cuban- question Is suro to come to tlio front in congress pretty soon Notwith standing tho recommendation of tho presi dent In his message thnt this country should Walt a reasonable time to soo Wlmt tho effoot Is to bo of Spnlns new policy In tho Island a largo number of senators and representatives think congress should toko some action without further dolny Tho dostro of tho Insurgent leaders In this country Is that congress rocogntzo tho bol llgeroncy of Cuba All tho lnfluonoo they possess Is to bo brought to bear far tho purposo of bringing about such recogni tion at this session of congress Thoy hopo to suoccod Already a resolution recogniz ing belligerency is pending In tho house having passed tho senate As to whothor or not It will ba taken up and discussed In tho houso and bo allowed to como to a vote depends altogether upon tho attltudo of ono man Speaker Reed Hoed on the Safety Valve Last session Speaker Itocd sat on tho safety valvo so to speak through sovoral long and trying months IIo resisted all tho offortsof the friends of Cuba to forco action Ills Justification was that congress had boon callod togothor for a special pur pose Tho administration was just in of fice and had had no tlmo to look Into tho Cuban question and to determine Its pol icy In thnt direction It Is obvious these arguments wll not hold good now If tho speaker concludes It to bo his duty to stand between tho houso and action concerning Cuba ho must haro sotno new means of justifying himself Thcso may bo found and tho situation thus bo hold substantial ly whoro It Is Nor Is It at all unlikely that tho houso Itself will bo more conservative than It was lost spring and tho scnuto as well Tho conditions havo changed MostYncn will agree that slnco tho adjournment of congress a greater measure of prosperity has como to tho peoplo of tho United States Thoro aro fower unemployed men and women than there wero a year ago Thcoutlook Is more hopeful Unquestion ably the temper of tho peoplo has changed to somo extent as to Cuba Vhcn things wore about as dark as they could bo In this country thoy thought a little troublo over Cuba certainly could not mako tho picture any inoro somber Any change might bo a cbango for tho hotter But now that tho situation is much Jmprovod they say they wont to hold what they have gained If prosperity is hero or Is coming thoy do not want it stricken down by a war or a rumor of war Without doubt this lino of roasonlng has had Its effect upon tho peoplo and upon tho peoples rep resentatives In congress So far I cannot discover among tho senators and ropresont atlyos any fierce dcslro to rush to Cubas aid Belligerency Claims Tho best argument In favor of a recog nition of the belligerency of Cuba Is thut It is a matter wholly within tho rights of the United Statos Whothor or not a stato of war shall bo officially recognized In a foreign country Is for a nation to deter mine solely wth refcronco to its own in terests That there is war in Cuba and has been war for a long tlmo no ono will dony If the United States chooses to say so and to govern itself accordingly It Is tho right of tho United States and tho ao tlon is not a causa for offonsoor complaint on tho part of Spain Tho truo Inwardness of tlia dcslro op the part of the Insurgents friends In this country for recognition of bclllgerenoy was given mo today by a man who Is fa miliar with all the facts If wo rccognUe belllgcroncy said he It will not of itself change tho relations between tho United Statos and Spain Peace will reign as before that Is until orno foolish or ovorzcalous Spanish naval officer exceeds his authority or makes a bad blunder and solzes an American ship on the high seas and carries the crow off to a Spanish dungeon Then thoro will be an uproar Tho peoplo will demand that this sort of thing bo stopped This Is precisely what the trlonds of Cuba are counting on Thoy reckon that with a state of war officially recognized It will Rot bo long before Spain soterlously of fends the American peoplo In her oxurclso of tho right of search upon tho ocean which she does not now possess that war Will follow Tbo Presidents Views President MoKlnley docs not want to Jaco tho question of belligerency IIo much prefers tha congress do not pass any reso lution to that effect and send It to him for his signature The president would not like to veto such a resolution nor yot would ho lke to sign It If he adopted tho Utter course as Is probable ho would fear for tho consequences If ho vetoed It tho Mottle who aro frlondly to Cuba would say m was tbe enemy of liberty Om of President MoKlnleys hobbles l peassful relations between the oxeoutlvo a4
