L. E FAULKNER & CO. Abilene Eeelectoe. Thursday, December 15, 1887, HENEY LITTS, Editor. It is quite amusing to compare the statements which some of the Republi can papers are making, regarding the country's prosperity during the past year, with the predictions of disaster and ruin with which those same papers surfeited their readers during the last Presidential campaign. Grover Cleve land was elected president, but disas ter and ruin to the country have not followed, by any means and nobody believed they would. The war-tariff-forever Republican organs at the East do not find their blind antagonism to tax reduction sus tained by their party brethern at the West. The Chicago Tribune, an able Republican journal, approves and praises the President's Message. It declares that it -'rises above party lines and points a common basis of patriotic statesmanship on which Republicans and Democrats are bound by every con sideration of public welfare and of political expediency to stand together," If the Republican party resists tariff reduction, says the Tribune, it is liable to be "overwhelmed." The President's Message bids fair to divide the Repub lican party and to unite his own. 2J. T. World. In Brief, and to the Point. dreadful.

It is easily put out of order. Greasy food, tough food, sloppy food, bad cookery, mental worry, late hours, and many other things which ought not to be, have made the American people a nation of dyspeptics. But Green's August Flower has done a wonderful work in reforming this sad business and making the American people so healthy that they can enjoy their meals and be happy.

Z&vOTTO IS: U It must be admitted that President Cleveland has shown himself capable in dealing with the great questions, and on the tariff his instincts are thor oughly sound and Democratic. It is . . safer to trust his sense and courage than trust some men who rattle round as professional reformers, and who knew all about it and are going to do wonderful things until the time for fighting comes. Alway3 right at heart, Mr. Cleveland has been a hard student of the tariff question the last two years and understands it. He sees, as truly as Frank Hurd himself, the iniquities bound up in it. He knows, as well as t Carlisle and Mills, that it must be dis posed of immediately. And he is no . mor afraid of it than he was of the five-cent eWatof bill or the dependent pension bill. The main issue in 1888 between the two great parties will be the tariff or unjust taxation. The conventions held this year show conclusively what we may expect next. In every instance, the Republicans are- in favor pf the v present high ta.iff; while, on the other hand, the Democrats are calling upon congress for the immediate levision of the tariff laws to a revenue basis; they favor the retention of the internal tax on whiskey and tobacco, and they pro test against any proposition for its re- - duction, made with the design of con tinuing the existing high tariff on the necessaries of life. The Iowa Demo crats were the last to speak on this question. Their unqualified declaration for revenue reduction in the right direc tion indicates their faith in the bound- : ness of .a position which, with marked effect at the polls, they have defended through many political campaigns. They may not achieve but they deserve success. Possessing convictions upon questiops of moment, they have the manliness, fb announce and to stand by them. Notice of Appointment.
