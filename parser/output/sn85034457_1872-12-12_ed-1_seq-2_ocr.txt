THE WEEKLY DEMOCRAT. L, G. GOULD, Editor. Thursday, Dae. 12, 1872. President's Message. On our outside will bo found the message of the Preeiderit, which is a plain unpretending review of the condition of public affair.', and contains no suggestions to . Congress, that is either new or - novel. After dealiug another of the blows At the fiauking privi lege to which that venerable a---, ibuee has become very well used, . the President declares his appro val of Postmaster General Ores -" well's postal telegraph scheme, but does not think the subject . can be disposed of in the present session of congress. The appre hensions of those who recognize in this scheme not merely a vast job for private aggrandizementat the expense of the country, but a dangerous interference of govern ment with the most private affairs of the people, were not at fault. President Grant is now fully com mitted to this enterprise, and - ; may be expected to sustain it with . all the power of his administra tion. Supported by a powerlu lobby supplied with abundant means of persuasions, it will be next to impossible to defeat this scheme in the coming congress. It will be a partial realization .cf that paternal policy of govern ment which has found so many admirers in the recent political ... 4 history of the country. Railroads and canals will next be absorbed and finally all the busiuess of the people will be conducted by dif- ferent bureaus of administration. This scheme will give tothegov ernment the control of not les9 than 60,000 new office holders. and supervision of the entire tele graphic correspondence of the country. In an exciting campaign ; At ia easy to conceive bt the ad. ' ' vantages it would give to the par ty manipulating the wires. Louis Napoleon has already shown the world what terrible uses he could make o! a government telegraph when he throttled the French Re public. Bat his example-will doubtless powerfully recommend this telegraph scheme to the lea ders of the oblican party. A measure of legislation more par tial and unjust, more completely "'"in .the interest of the few at the expense of the many could scarce ly be devised. In a boundless einntry like this, the annual de ficit to the treasury under a re duction of rates, would be enor- : mous, and that burden would fall on the masses of -taxpayers ( who makes exceedingly small use of the telegraph. Of the farmers and mechanics of Ohio how-many are there who usethe telegraph wires and who in their correspon- -. dence cannot await the. course of th e mails? Of the 800,000 negroes who voted for Grant how many send a dispatch in a year? Yet the vast majority-of the people are to bo inflicted with this bur den for the advantage of the few, The scheme, however, has been recommended by th President and it, therefore, becomes a por tion of the policy of his party. General Maxwell committed suicide in Dayton last week, by shf oting himself through the head. Financial embarrassment is supposed to he the cause. ; His 1 'funeral took place on Monday last, and is said to have been the largest seen in that city since that of Mr. Vallandiham. A series of 'well defined gold bearing veins have been discov ered near Kelley's Ford, Virginia, five miles from the Rappahan nock station. The surface rock of gold bearing quartz yields lrom sixty to one hundred dollars per ton. Three tunnels are now .being worked through a rich rock, 'and everything gives evidence of permanency. The Electoral College. The Presidential Electors re-assembled in the Senate Chamber Dec. 4 at 12 a..m., and with a proper amount of solemnity all cast their votes for U. S. Grantlbr President and Henry Wilson for Vice Pres ident. Dolly Vardeu, though popular as a name, has proved very un profitable to manufacturers and dealers in dress goods, many of whom have been driven to the verge of bankruptcy by investing la large stocks of this class. S. Presidential Clemency! From Washington comes the very ttartlirg news that Presi des! t Grant has pardoned Hodges, the paj master who swindled the Government ou of some 400,000 although he has not yet strved ono-seventh part of the period for winch he was sentenced. A year ami a haif ago, when this polished robber vs doomed to ten years in State prison, the Ad ministration orgaiis exulted in glowing eulogies of Grant and his determination to stamp our Tweedism in Federal offices by making terrible examples of cul prits caoght and con victed. Ever since then the case of Houges has been held up as a sample of the administration of Federal justice in contrast to the taso of Tweed in Nev York. 4iTi:er?," poiuting to llodgs, "is what -we do with our rascals,'' the Federal orgaus were never tired of shout ing. They never forgot to add, in the next breath, "There," pointing to Tweed "is the way the Democrats tried their thieves."- The argument of the comparison uuaouDteaiy naa yeiut tin many people. When, during the campaign, a report gained circu lation that Hodges was to be pardo.ned, it was judignautly de- niedby the Administration press, It will now be interesting to note how these same journals will ac count for the President's clemen cy (!) in ordering the criminal's release so soon after election and before Hodges ha3 Berved one fifth of his sentence. Meanwhile what has become of those Ku- Klux pardous we heard so much hmi nnrthrAflmnnlo ii I J. lie Venerable Jesse, the ia- tner or ins eon, Ulysses, nas got the President into a very un pleasant position. Like a good son (no matter what may be thought of the act as President.) he made father Jesse a postman ter. Jesse drew the pay with out doing the duties. Finally Jesse got sick and continued ill so long that scandal compelled a new appointment. A Mr, Eastern was chosen, Jesse got well, got his venerable backup, and Easton was compelled, to re- sign. To Mr. Grant's credit, as President, he wrote back beg- ging Easton to euspeu i action, and expressing regret that his latner snooa nave interterea. upshot of it. has been that the old man has caned Easton.

The House of Renreeen- tatives will consist of 292 mem bers. : Of these, tbe Republicans will have 199, and the Democrats 93. So it will be seen that Grant will have more than a two-thirds majority in that body after the 3d of March. The Grant party having been fairly beaten in New Orleans and .Louisiana, have applied to the U. Court for an injunction to pre vent the votes lrom being count ed.

According to an act passed by the Lcgisla- ture, the ballot is printed in long primer Capital letters, ';on paper of uniform size, color, weight, texture and appearance, twelve inches long by four inehr-s wide, and folded crosswise four times from the centre bo as to make the ballot three fourths of an inch in size and pressed Hat." The law ah?o provides that "uo ballot must be used having any mark or thing on the back or outside thereof whereby it might be distinguish ed from any other ballot legally used." Also-v that "all erasures of names of candidates and sub stitutions of others mnft be made with a lead pencil or common writing ink. All nthei orations or substitutions will be n-jected." This does away with "pasters'' al together. 2Jo person is allowed to exhibit the contents of a bal lot within 100 teet of .the polls nor reqneft any one else to do so under very severe penalties of the code. There was a noble youth, who, on being urged to take wine at the table of a statesman in Wash ington,' had the niorul courage to retuse. He'waa n, pure young m:.n,just beginning the struggles of lite. lie brought letters to the great statesman who kindly invited him home to dinner. "Not take a glass of wine?" said the great statesman, in won derment and surprise. "Xnt one simple glass of wme?' echoed the statesman s beautifu and fascinating wife, a3 she arose glass in hand, and. with a grace that would have charmed an an chorite, endeavored to press it upon turn. "No," said the heroic youth resolute!, gently repelling the pronerea glass. What a picture of moral gran deur was that! A poor, friendless youth refusing wme at th. table of a wealthy and famous states man, even though proffered by the tair hands.ot a beautiful lady "No," paid the noble young man, and his voice trembled a little and his chook flushed.
