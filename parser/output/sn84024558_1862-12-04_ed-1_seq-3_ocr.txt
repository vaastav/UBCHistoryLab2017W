State?, the same sum would not have done ®ore to close the war than has been otherwise done. If so, the measure would save money, fl nd in that view would be a product and eeo D oinical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing.— But it is easier to pay a large sura than it is to pay a larger one, and it is easier to pay an y sum, when we are able than it is to pay it before we are able. Tbo war requires them a t once—the aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course would be ] ar <re, but it would really require no cash, nor bonds, any faster than the emancipation pro gresses. This might not, and probably would not olo fi e before the end of thirty-seven years. At that time we shall probably have one bniidred millions of people to share the burd ens, instead of thirty one millions as now, and not only so, but the increase of our population jnnv be expected to continue for a long time after the period as rapidly as before, because oar territory will not have become full. Ido not state this inconsiderably. At the same ratio of increase which we have maintained on on average from our first national census in 11' JO, until that of 1860, we should in 1900 have a population ol 103.205.415 ; and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period ? Our abundant room, onr broad ; national homestead is our ample resource.— j W< re our territory as limited as are the Brit- ! ish isles, very certainly our population could j not expand as stated. Instead of receiving the foreign born as now, we should lie com- | pellet! to send part of the native born away j tut such is not our condition. \V • have two j millions nine hundred ai d sixty three thou--- [ and square miles ; Europe has three millions ! aud eight hundred thousand, with a popula ! ticn averaging seventy-three and one third j persons to the square mile. Why may not j otrcountry at some time average as many ? j Is it less fertile ? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts or other causes ? Is it inferior to Europe in any natur al advantage ? If. then, we are at some time j to he as populous as Europe, how soon ? As ! to when this may be, we can judge by the ; past an i the present As to when it will if ever, depends much on whether we maintain j the Union Sevcrai of our States are above the : average European population of seventy-three j and a half to the square mile. Massachusetts | ■gins one hundred fifty seven, Rhode I•I at I 1 133, ! New York and New Jersey each 80 ; also, two otln r great States, Pennsylvania and j Ohio, are not far below, the former having 63 j and the latter 59. The Stales above the European average, except New Yoik, have in - j creased in as rupid ratio since pa-Jug that point i as ever before, while no one of them is equal j to some other parts of our country in natural j capacity for sustaining a dens; population. Taking the nation in the aggregate and we ; find its population and the ratio of increase ! for the several decimal periods to be as fol lows : 1700— 3.1120527. lso _ 5.3n5,!-47— 02 per rent, ratio of increase. ] s 10— K.'J.1.t.5U4—37.4.1 per rent, ratio ol i:i tease. Ix2o y.tll!- 1 i 11—33.13 pr rent, ratio of increase. 1530—12.Mi11.020—33.40 per cent, ratio of increase. 1-40—IT .0.;: 14. ">3—32 , 7 percent, ratio of increase. 1- >0- 23 101.M0J—35.57 per rent, ratio of increase. 1-00—31.442,790—35,56 per rent, ratio of increase. This shows .'.n average decennial increase of 34 GO per cent in population through the sev enty years from our first to our last census taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase at no one of these seven periods is cither 2 | per rent abovA the average, tlt tin showing how ii flexible and consequently how reliable j the law of increase in our case is. Assuming | that it will continue, it. gives the following ! results : 1870,42 323,341; 1880, 56,96?-! 217: 1890, 76,677,892 : 1900, 103,308,415 ; 1910, 138,818,526; 1920, 186,984,235 ; 1931>', I 251,680,914. These figures show that our : country may lie as populous as Europe now is ; at some point between 1920 and 1980, say about 1925 ; our territory, p.t 73 12 persons j to the square mile. b"i-g ol the crp> ity to 1 contain 217 186,090 ; and we w : 'l re a •! this, too, if we no not r linquish the chances by the , folly and evils of disunion or by long and ex haunting war springing from the only great : element of national discord among us While j it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one ; huge example of secession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard the population, civilization and prosperi y, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious. T' proposed emancipation Would shorten I the war, perpetuate p-ace, insure this increase j of population, and proportionally the Wealth > of the country. With this we should pay ad the emancipation would cost, together with I our other debts, easier than we should pay onr other debts without it. Ir we had allowed ; our old N itional debt to run at six per cent j per annum, at simple interest, ftotn the end of ( the U •volu'iomiry struggle till to-day, without i paying anything on either principal or interest, ! -each m in of us would owe less upon that debt | now iha-n each man owed up' n it then ; and j this because-of our increase of m m through the whole period has been greater than 6 per I stent, awl -has rnn faster than the interest ; •upon the -debt. Thus, time alone relieves a debtor nation so long as its population in •creases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on the debt. This fact, would be no exense for delaying the paymarvt of what is justly due; but ii shows the great important:* of this connection, the great advantage of a poli cy by which we shall not have to pay until we number a hundred millions, what, by a riiff r cut policy, we could have to pay now when the number is hut thirty one millions In a word, it shows that a dollur will be much harder to pay for the wnr than will lie a dol Jar for emancipation on the propo<ed plan.— And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life. It will be a saving of both. As to the second article, I think it would be iin practicable to return to bondage the class of persons contemplated. Some of them, doubt less, in the property sense, belong to loyal owners, and hence provision is made in this article for compensating such. The third article relates to the futureof the freed people It does not oblige but merely authorize Con gress to aid in colonizing such as may consent. This had not ought to be regarded as objec "tional on the one hand, or on the other, inas much as it comes to nothing unless by mutual consent of the people to be deported, and the American people through their representatives in Congress. I cannot make it better known than it already is, that 1 strongly favor colo tiizition : and yet 1 wish to say there is an objection urged against the colored people remaining in the country, which is largely Imaginary if not sometimes malicious. It is ins -ted that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere ornaments that time surely is now. In times lik< the present men should utter nothing for which -they would not willingly be responsible through time and eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than remaining slaves?— It they stay in their old places they jostle no white la borers. If they lea ve their old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically there is neither more or less of it. Emancipation, even without deportation, woold probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed. The freed people would surely not do more than their old pro portion o it, and very probably, for a time, would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers-, bringing their labor into greatei demand, and. consequently, en hancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a limited extent, edhancing wages ol wiiite labor, is math ematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the market ; increase the demaui for it, and you in crease the price ol it. Reduce the supply of black labor, by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and by preci-ely so much you increase the demand lor and the wages ol white labor, lint it is decided that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land. Are they net already in the land ? Will liberation make them anymore numerous? Equally distributed umong the whites of the whole count>y, and there would be butoue colored to seven whites. Could the one in any way great ly disturb the seven ? There are many communities now having more than one free colored person to seven whites and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District ol Columbia and tbe States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this condition. The District has more than <>ue tree colored to six whites. Yet, in its Irequcut petitions to Congress, 1 believe it has never pre sented the presence of free colored persons as one of its greviances. But why should Emancipation South send the freed people North ? People of any color seldom run unless there lie something to run frmii. Heretofore, col ored peoule, to some extent, have fled North Irom bon dage. and now. perhaps trnm both—bondage and des titution ; but if gradual Emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will h tve neither to flee from. Their oiu masters will give them wages, at least, until new la borers can be procured ; and the (reed men, in turn, will gladly give .heir labor tor the wages till new homes can tie found for them in congenial climes, and with people ol their own blood and race. This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests j involved, and in any event, cannot the North decide lor | itself, wlie her t.> receive them. Again, as practice proves more than tli ory in any ca-e, has there been any irruption <>t colored people northward because ol the abol- J ishmeut of Slavery in this District, last Spring ? What : I have -ciid of he proportion of lice colored persons to the whites in the District ol Columbia is from the census of 1 Mio, h ving no reference to persons called contra hands, nor to those made tree by the act of Congress abolishing Slavery here. The plan consisting of these articles is leconimendi d, not but that a restoration ofthe National authority would be accepted without its adop tion ; nor will the war, nor proceeding- under the i'roc l.nnati:>n of September 22d istri, be stayed, because of the recommendation of this plan, its timely adoption I doubt t: it would bring restoration, and thereby stay both. And notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provides by law tor compensating any State which may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would not only be an advance part of the plan, and the same argument apply to both This plan is recommend ed as a means not in exclusion of but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving the National author ity through 1 ut the Union. The subject is presented ex clusively t> its economical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more speedily than can he done by force alone, while it would cost, considering amounts and manner of payment and times ol payment, and the amounts would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely only upon force. It is most likely—very likety—that it would cost no blood at all. The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It cannot become such without the eoncurrance of—first two-thirds of Congress, and afterwards three-fourths ol : the States. The requisite three-fourths of the States will j necessarily include seven Slave States. Their concur- , rente, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally j adopting emancipation at no distant day upon the new j constitutional terms. This assurance would end the struggle now, and save the Union forever I d > not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the nation, by the Chief Magistrate of the nation, nor d I forget that some ol yo are my seniors, nor that many of you have more | experience than I in the conduct, ol public affairs: yet I j trust, that in view of the great responsibility re-ting up- j on me, you will preeeive no want of respect to yourselves j in any undue earnestness I may seem to display. Is it j doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war. and thus lessen its expenditure ot mo ney and of blood ? Is it doubted that it would restore the national prosperitn. and perpetuate both iudelinately ? Is it doutted that we here. Congress and Executive, can secure its adoption ? Will not the good people re spond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they, by any other means, so certainly or so'speedily assure these vital objects ? We can succeed only by con cert. It is not " Can any of us imagine better ?" but '• Can we all do better ?"' Object whatsoever is possible still the question recurs " Can we do better ?" The dog ma of the quiet past are inadequate to Hie stormy pres ent. The occa-ion is piled high with difficulty, and we niu-t rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country. Fellow c tizens—We cannot escape history. We. of this Congress, will be remembered in spite Of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare i one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will lignt us d >wn in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We say that we are for the Union. The world will not forget t hat while we say this, we do know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We, even we tiere, hold the power and hear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to j the free, honorable alike in what we give and what we i preserve. We .-hall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope j of the ea tli. Other means may succeed. This conhl not f ail. The w.iv is plain—peaceful, generous, ju-t—a way i which, if illowed, the world will ever applaud and God | must forever bless. 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Washington, Dec. 1, 1%2. SUMMARY OF NEWS. The news telegraphed from the Ileadqtiar to-s of the Armv of the Potomac is not itn p fa-it. The cannonading mentioned in pre vious dispatches, it now appears, was from one of the enemy's right wing batteries. The explanation of it is not known We have some add tional news of much importance from the rebel side of the Rappahannock, brought over by two gentlemen recently tro:n Richmond, and holding positions under the rebel Gov ern eut —ooe as a Captain in a Texas regi ment, and the other as a clerk in the Quar termaster's Department—and who have con eluded to seek protection under the o!d flag. These gentlemen agree that the rebel force at Fredericksburg numbers from 75,000 to 100,- GOO men certainly not exceeding the latter figure. LEE and his associates are for ot.ee, I however, puzzled by the movements of our armv, and are in doubt as to its future move ments. They think the attack on Richmond | is to be made from some other quarter, and acting upon this idea, they have commenced the erection of earthworks for the protection jof a garrisou force, while the main body ol 1 their army has again commenced moving toward Richmond. The Quartermaster's clerk further says that the entire rebel army has never exceeded 475,000 men. The Memphis correspondent of the Chicago Tribune telegraphs under date of Nov. 26 : " There is nothing especially new, except tbut Gen. SHERMAM has been all day ou the move. lam not iuloiined as to his destination, llie rebels fear very much that he may move upon Grenada. Gen. SHERMAN'S advance was known in Mobile a week ago, and created a lively interest. All their railroads were moving troops, but no longer in the direction ol Holly Springs. On the contrary, they take the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to Columbus, Mississippi, where the rebels have exteusive ordnauce stores. I learn thut WOOD'S Division entered Lebanon on the Bth, driving MORGAN'S cavalry away. - j" Over the left," the cant phrase im plying fulsehood, has been abandoned for the more emphatic aud significant expression, k" Over the wires.".

ON Tuesday morning last, a little in fant, apparently about four or five weeks old, was found on the door step of Mrs. J. D. VANDEKCOOK, a widow la dy of this place. The little one, as the night was very cold, was much chilled, but proper restoratives being ap plied, soon revived, and is now in the possession of Mrs. A. M. KRAMER. Who its parents are is a mystery—to the child. B®* INFANTICIDE. —On Thursday last, a man named ELEAZEK HARRINGTON, and his wife SUSAN, were brought to this place, from Terry township, and confined in jail, chargid with murdering a little child, some three or four weeks old. As Court convened on Monday, the case was submitted to the Grand Jury, and a True Bill found. The Court ordered Sheriff SPALDING, Drs LAUD, TURNER and DEXNISON, to proceed to the place where the child was interred,and disentomb itanJ make a post mortem examination. This examination was made, and we are informed by one of the party, that the corpse presented a most horrible and sickening as pect. The body presented signs i f abu-e and was maltreat ed in the most shameful manner—its limbs and body be ing bruised and mangled to a shameful extent. Both parties are late from Wyoming county. They will prob ably have their trial during this session. THE last number of the Union Advo catc, published in Auburn, CaL, contains the death of MARVIN E. MILLS, son of STEPHEN A. MILLS of North Towanda township. Mr. MILLS studied law with J. C ADAMS Esq., and alter being admitted to practice, emi grated to California, where he arrived in 1851. He first started in that country by engaging in mining, but he soon gave it up and commenced the practice of law in Pla cer county. In 1854 he run on the Whig Ticket and was elected District Attorney. During the time he held that important office, he gained an enviable reputation as a criminal lawyer and was considered by many as second to none in tbe .State, lie leaves a large circle of friends to mourn his early death. He died of disease of the brain. PHOTOGRAPH ALBUMS. —More gaiety and more gravity have been exercised over photograph albums than over any other species of compilation.— They are either portraits or parodies of all the •' beau ties, harmonies, and sublimities of (human) nature."— A great many very had jokes have been cracked over them, and a few rather good ones. A bewitching little wile and an old satyr of a husband have been character ized as a new version of Beauty and the Beast—a weak husband aud a Jezebel wile, as St. George and the Dragon. Sedate clergymen, with very black gloves and very white neckties; sedate matrons, pluming themselves on their plumpness, and engaging in their enbonpoint ; green, skinny school girls, with sickly-looking eyes and short dresses ; middle aged men about town, excessively polite and exceedingly iprofatft ; heads of families, look ing as though the)' were being asked for money and were trying to get out of it; actors in attitude, and dancers twirling on their toe-tips—all these, and a hun dred others which cannot be illustrated in a local, con gregate together in a photograph album. Some look as if they were visited with strokes of ge nius ; some with strokes of apoplexy-; others as if they should be picking rags; and others, again, as if their proper vocation was picking pockets. A few faces may be called i eautiful. Women have often been called an gels, and we presume it is for this reason lovers always prefer their sweethearts represented as among the clouds. Babies are bad enough in real lite, (mothers, please pass over this portion;) hut in albums they bloom with a meek, sleepy kind of infantile horror, which is not pre ferable to their natural gilts Of mind and person. How ever, as we are always in for fashions, so with respect to ibis fashion we cry with the crowd, rive the photo graphic albums. -- A fine assortment of Nose albums are now Lcf; sale at ALVORJJ'S Book ami Stationery Store, Post Oflicc building.
