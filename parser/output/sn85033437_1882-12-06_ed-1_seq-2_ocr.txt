It is a very creditable document, conservative, liberal, progressive and suggestive. No doubt, it will be generally en dorsed, and endorsed highly. Our Democratic editors look through it for some erround of "accusation against him," but find none. Every patriotic American will read it with pride: it makes a grand show ing for a grand Nation. It points out good things done, and good things to be done. It recommends reform where needed: and is free from gush. If any of our readers have failed to carfcf ully study it, we hope they will vet do bo. It is worth any man s hour, though that hour be of gold and set with sixty diamond minutes, President Arthur, to-day, stands fnrth ai a Statesman worthy of the Republic THE 

PAYMENT OF THE NATIONAL DEBT SHALL IT CONTINUE ? There is one proposition io the Presidential message we non-concur in, that wherein he opposes the ranid reduction of the National Debt. NAt.irma. like men. should pay off their debts in times of prosperity. Now is a time of prosperity. If season of adversity should come, we conld meet it better with the debt paid or reduced. Aornin- evfirv time a million dol- lars of our debt is paid, that amount of money is forced into agriculture, manufactures, mining or commerce The results are the development of the country, the giving employment to labor and, the advancement of the welfare of all. Money locked up in government bonds draws interest out of the pockets of the people. When government bonds are paid the money goes into the pockets of the people. The paying off of our debt has built many a factory, has opened manv a mine: has erected many a furnace, has constructed many a mile of railroad and has made labor profitable. Money hoarded in bonds is money put into ponds; it draws the wealth of the land into it When the bonds are paid, the i money is redistributed over the land, and adds to its wealth. We say empty v the money-ponds, and spread their contents all over the Nation. KELLOGG AND EEDDLEBEBGER. The attempt to prove that Kellogg is not legally a citizen of Louisiana, in order to invalidate bis election to Congress, is sillier than the Missis sippi plan which is applied to Chal mers. There is only one way to get rid of such cattle as Kellogg in poli tics, and that is by beating them at the polls. The politicians who cooked up tne unaimers ana the ivenog contest do their states serious harm, and they should be put down. There is an ugly look, too, in the news from Virginia. Riddleberger will hardly be foolish enough to ftght a duel, but, if he does and he- is killed, the outside opinion is sure. to be unfavorable to those who caused or encouraged the combat. The pis tol case as well as the bludgeon must be eliminated from politics in the South as well as in the North. We clip the foregoing from the Charleston, S. C, News and Courier4 and commend it to the blind-eyed Cyclopean Democrats, who, Polyphemus-like, are ranging for revenge and seeking to tear down all in reach. We rejoice to read such sentiments in a South Carolina paper, for it shows that South Carolina has taken on " the new man " in politics. We delight to commend an adversary for his good deed ; and when he coin mend we mix no bitter reproofs in our eulogiums. Success to the right ! Journalistic Change. Capt. Wm. Rule has sold the Knox ville Chronicle to a stock company for sixteen thousand dollars. The company had been organized to start a new paper, but as there was hardly a field or room for two Republican dailies to do a good business, it was no doubt best all around to make the transaction stated. The price paid is a good round sum, but not too much when it is considered that this is the only Republican daily worthy of the name in the South, and that it has long been well es tablished and self-sustaining upon its merits as a newspaper. Knoxville is a growing place, a live manufacturing and business cen ter, where one Democratic and one Republican paper, well conducted, can always be sustained. The pur chase was made by Colonel James Monroe Meek, a prominent lawyer and capitalist, for a company com posed of himself, and Colonel Henry R. Gibson, Judge Li. O. Honk, Judge O. P. Temple, Colonel Isham You g, Colonel J. M. Melton. Colonel Fr. Be, Tavernier and Rev. Geo. W. LeVere. (colored), and others. Colonel Gib son is editor of the Weekly Republi can which will be merged with the Weekly Chronicle, and he will be come editor of the daily. He is a bright, able man, and a Stalwart Republican, but he gives it out already that the Chronicle will be conducted upon strict business principles as a conservative Republic can paper; that no further war will be made upon Captain Rule, who was defeated by Houk for Congress, and that the great work of liepubhcaniz ing Tennessee and the South will still go on. The Chronicle will have a clear and a big field and be backed by ample capital as well as con ducted by brainy men. It will no doubt be a greater power than ever. Republicanism in East Tennessee is of an extreme typei to be found no where else. Micnigan, Iowa, Kans sas, all New England and all the South mkht go Democratic but East Tennessee, never. Caotain Kule is too convervative and mod erate ior mat section. rie was twenty years ahead of the times up there. Like the rest, he was sincere, but the crowd was against him by an overwhelming majority. It was charged before the election that he had sold out to the democrats Decause ne aared to run against houk wnen tnere was no Democrat m the field. But he has sold out to Houk and a crowd of the veriest stalwarts to be found in the country. Captain Rule is a thorough gentleman, a self-made man, a well trained journalist, good writer and a useful citizen. We regret to see one of his fine moral courage and nice sense of the duties and proprieties of journalism, leave the editorial chair, and hope that he yet may be herd from in the profession which he adorned for many years, and in which he was so useful and success ful. Memphis Public Ledger. The Tariff. The great issue oi national lm- 1 portance now before the public is that of the tariff, or more correctly speaking, free trade or protection. The Republicax patty advocates pro- tection, while the Democratic party is divided between protection and free trade; but the latter party has advanced daring the past few years and now considers favorably the doctrine of tariff for revenue only. The Republicans desire a revision of the present tariff system and the democrats desire to revise that re vision. It may be admitted that no party will go before the country ad- vacating absolute free trade; to do so " would be suicidal. Whenever the great west or in the new South a railroad is ex tended or a manufactory is estab lished you will find the protection seed growing and developing. The South is clamoring for manufactures and is rapidly advancing in that line. Protection as a principle follows closely in the wake of manufactures as closely as the shadow does the substance in the sunlight. The free trade system of England means; low wages so as to manufacture goods at a minimum cost. The protective system is one of high wages, and it means also a circulation of money among the people. The Ameri can workingman's food is much cheaper and the substantial clothing which he wears costs no more than that of the workingrman's of foreign lands. No doubt the present tariff system needs practical revision and it should be the mission of the Demo cratic party to bring about that re vision. The iron, cotton, wool, silk and other manufactures are now springing, up with rapidity in the South and West, and their products can be found side by side with those of- the Eastern and Middle State, competing successfully in a 1 the great central markets. What is now be ing done throughought the republic is the fruits of a tariff system. It is true that western farmers pay trib ute to eastern manufactures, but the manufacture of their immediate neighborhoods are springing up su perseding those at a distance. V hile America is a protectionist against Europe yet over an area as large as Europe, within itself, there exists absolute free trade. Heme produc tion and home consumption are alike encouraged and they ensure to both the greatest advantage. Ava lanche. Senate After March 4th. It is now apparent that the politi cal control of the Senate after March 4th, 1883, by the Republicans, will depend on the vote of the two Re" adjuster Senators from Virginia, and during the last session of Congress Mr. Mahone uniformly acted with the Republicans on the political questions and it is expected that he will continue to do so, and that his colleague, Mr, Riddleburger, will also co-operate with that party. The terms of twenty-six Senators will expire March 4th next. Of that number fourteen are Democrats, eleven are Republicans and one, Davis, of Illinois, is an Independent. Deducting these twenty-six the relative strength of the par ties would be : Republicans twenty six, Democrats twenty-three, an In dependent, and Mahone of Virginia. To fill the vacancies that will occur, the Democrats will elect Senators from the following named States : Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Geor gia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missis sippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. This will make their numerical strength in the next Senate thirty-six. The States of Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi have chosen Democrats for the term beginning the 4th of March. The States which will choose Republican Senators prior to March 4th are Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Mich igan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon and Rhode Isl and. These twelve new Senators, will make the Republican strength thirty-eight, which number is equal to one-half of tue entire strength of the body. Iowa, Oregon and Rhode Island have already chosen Republi cans for the term beginning March 4th, and Virginia has chosen a Re adjuster, Riddleberger, to succeed a Democrat, Johnson, and it will be thus seen that the upper branch of the Fortyeighth Congress will con sist of thirty-eight Republicans, thirty-six Democrats, an two Read justers, aDd the vote of one of the Virginia Senators will give the Re publichns a majority, while the votes of both the Senators from that State given to the Democrats would make a tie.

The people of Tennessee will now have a true Republican daily paper. Colonel Gibson, who takes charge, is an able writer, an educated hixrh- toned gentleman, and as true a Re publican as can be" found in the btate.
