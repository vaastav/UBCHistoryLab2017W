Reading of the Message Attracted a Large Crowd In the Htuise. Washington, Dec- 4 —There was a •ery good attendance in the galleries of the house to listen tx (the reading ot the first message of President Roosevelt. The members gathered early, chatting and discussing pros­ pective legislation. The mafin topic was the personality of the new presi­ dent. Keen interest was manifested in what he would have to s%y in his message. As the hamids of the clock pointed to 12 Speaker Henderson called the house to order. The speaker announc­ ed the appointment of the committee on rules as Collows: Mr. He--lenson of Iowa, Mr. Dalzell of Pennsylvania, Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, Mr. Richardson of Tennessee amd Mr. Underwood of Alabama. The only change in the committee was the substitution of Mr. Underwood for Mr. Bailey of Texas, who is now a member of the senate. Mr. Bingham (Pa.), at the head of the committee appointed to wait upon the president, reported that t.h^ committee accom­ panied by a like committee from the senate had performed its duty and tko president had received the message with pleasure and had said he would at once communicate with the two houses in writing. Two minutes later Major Pruden, assistant secretary of the president, appeared at the main en­ trance and announced a message from the president. The message was taken to the speaker's desk, where Speakoi Henderson broke the seal. "A message from the president the United States," he said, as he handed the document to the reading clerk and directed him to read it. Or­ dinarily presidential messages at the opening of congress are listened to in a perfunctionary fashion, but through­ out the reading the keenest interest was manifested Hardly a member left'his seat until the reading was con­ cluded. The reading of the message was con­ cluded in the house at 2:35. Mr. Gros­ venor then offered the following reso­ lution, which was adopted: "Resolved, Thiat a committee of one member from each state represented In this house, be appointed on the part of the house to join such committee as may be appointed on the part of the senate to consider and report by what token of respect and affection it may be proper for the congress of the Unit­ ed States to express the deep sensibil­ ity of the nation to the tragic death of the late president, William McKinley, and that so much of the message of the president as relates to that deplor­ able event be referred to such com­ mittee." In pursuance of the terms of the res­ olution tfhe speaker appointed a com­ mittee consisting of one member from each state ami territory. The house then, as a further mark of respect, adjourned.
