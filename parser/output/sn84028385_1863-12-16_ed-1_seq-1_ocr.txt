FOREIGN RELATIONS. j 1 I , vt and Ac, of j We remain in peace and friendship with I foreign powers. The efforts of disloyal citiiens of the United State to involve us in foreign wars to aid in inexcusable in surrection, have f-een unavailing. Her Britanic Majesty's Government, as was justlv expm ied. have exercised their au thority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions trout British ports. The Emperor of France has by a like pro dinl? i.romntlv indicated the neutrality which Le proclaimed at the beginning of the contest, questions 01 great intricacy and importance have arisen out of the I.Wka.l and other bellieertit overations Kteii the Government and several of the maritime powers, but they Lave been discussed, and ao lr as wa powible ac commodated in a spirit of frnnkness. jus tice and mutual good win. it ise.spec.aj ly gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudication, have commsnded the respect ,.. m.vitirne DOwerS. e reined ana conaaence 1 The supplimental treaty between tue 'nite.1 States and Great Britain lor the mes&ion ol llie Aincan slave nuo - .. . i . i. auitttl made on the 17th day of February last has beeu duly ratified and carried into execu tion. It is believed that so far as Amer ican ports and Ameii-an citizens are con cerned that tnuuman ana taroanou9 irai f.f has Iteen broueht to an end. I .hull submit lor the consideration of the Senate a convention for the adjust ment of Dossessorv claims in Washington Tarritnrv. arisine out of the treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, bet ween the United Smih nii Great Britain, and which have been the source of gome disquiet i among the citizens of that now tapidly mrt of the country. A novel and imporUnt question, involv ing the extent of the maritime jurisdic tion of Spain in the waters which sur round the Uland of Cuba, "has been de bated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed in an amicable spirit to re fer it to the arbitratement of a friendly power. A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate. I have thought it proper to subject to the approval of the Senate, to concur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues npon the principles which have been heretofore adopted in regard to the imports upon navigation in the. waters of Denmark. The long pending controversy between this Government and that of Chili touch ing the seizure at Silana, in Peru, by Chilian officers of a large amount in treas ure belonffins to citizens of the United States has been brought to a close, by the award of his Majesty the King of the Bel gians, to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties. The subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate, and although the sum awarded to the claim ants may not have been a large aa they exreeted. there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his Majesty's decision. Th.t decision was cromptivcom plied with bv Chili, when intelligence in regard to it reached that country. The joint com mixeion under the act of the last session for carrying into effect the Convention with Peru on the sulject of claims has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in the business entrusted to it. The dif ficulties concerning inter-oceanic ttansit through Nicaragua are in course of amic able adjustment, in conformity with prin ciples set forth in my last Annual Mes sage. I have received a Representative from the United States of Columbia, and have credited a Minister to that Republic. Incident occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of the international question touching the right of foreigners in this country and of the United States citizens abroad. In regard to some gov ernment these rights are at least partial ly defined by treaties. In no instance, however, it is expressly stipulated that in the instance of civil war a foreigner resi ding in this country, within the lines of the insurgents, is to exemptea irom tue rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whose behalf the Government of his coun try cannot express any privileges or im munities distinct from that character, I regret to say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and in some in stances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the United States the greater part of their lives. There is reason to be lieve that many persons bom in foreign countries, who have declared their inten tions to become citizens, or who have been fullv naturalized, have evaded the milita ry duty required of them by denying the fact, and thereby throwing upon the Gov ernment the burden of proof. It has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proor from the want of guides to the nror,er sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring the Clerks of Courts, where delaretions of intention mii Le made or naturalization effected. to send periodically, lists of the names of persons naturalized, or declaring tneir m tion to become citizens, to the Secretary of the Interior, m whose department tb9e names must be arranged and print ed for general information. There are reasons to oeueve mat lureifuasnrvjucm lv become citizens of the United States for the sole purpose of evading the duties imposed by the laws of their nativa coun try, to which in becoming naturalized here, thev at once repair, and never re turning to the United States, Ihey still claim the interposition of the Government as citizens. Many altercations and great prejudice have heretofore arisen out this abuse. It is therefore submitted your serious consideration. It might be advisable to fix the limit beyond which no citizen of the United States, residing abroad, may claim the interposition of his Government- The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by al iens under pretense of naturalization, which they have disavowed when drafted into the military service. I submit the expediency of such an amendment of the Laws as will make the fact of voting an estopple against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obliga tion, on the grounds of alienage. In common of other Western Powers, our relations with Japan have been bro't into serious jeopardy through, the per verse opposition of the hereditary aristoc racy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of tbeTycoon, designed to bring the country into the society nations. It ia to be hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these difficul ties may be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to lie ICnister residing of to ; of there f'-r the damages he su-tnind in the destruction "V fire of the rt-sid iire t.f llie Legation at Yeddo.

Suchcon- ....... It outlay, would be economical a wen nsei-; rective aids to the diplomatic, military : and naval services. j Th Consular a stem of the United ; S'.aies under the enactments of the la-t Congress, begin to be felf sustaining, and there l reason to hope mat it may ut-come entirely so. with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace u re stored. Our Ministers abroad have been faithfal in defending American rights. In protecting our r-ommercial interests, our Consuls have necessarily had to en counter increased labors and responsibil ities growing put of the -war. These they have for the most part met and discharg ed with zeal and efficiency. This ac knowledgement justly includes those Con suls who, residing in Morocco, Egypt. China and other central countries, are charged with complications and extraor dinary powers. The condition of the sev eral organized Territories is generally sat isfactory, although the Indian disturb ances in New Mexico have not been en tirely suppressed. The mineral resource of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico and Arizona are proving far richer than heretofore understood. I lay before j ou a communication on this subject from the Governor of New Mexico. I again submit to your con-ideiatiou the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration. Although this source of national wealth is again flowing with greater fieedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred, there is still a great dtrlicieiio) of laborers in every field of industry, es pecially in agriculture and iu our mines, aa well of iron and coal as of precious met als. While the demaud for labor is thus increased here, tens of thousands of per sons destitute of remunerative occupation are thronging our foreign Consulates and offering to emigrate to the United State, if essential, but very cheap assistance, can be afforded them. It is easy to s-e that under the sharp discipline ol civil war the nation is beginning a new life, and this noble effort demands the aid, and ought to receive the attention and uiLort of the government. Injuries unforseen by the Government and unintended, may in some cases have been inflicted uion the snbiecta or citizens of foreign countries, both at sea and on land, by person in tLe seavice of the Unites States. As this Government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the United States, we must ne prepares to do justice to foreigners. If the judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a soecial court mav be authorized with power to bear and decide such claims of the character teterred to as may nave arisen under treaties and public law. Conventions for adjusting claims by such commission have been proposed to some Governments, but no definite answer to the proposition ha yet been received from any. In the course of the season I shall prob ublv have occasion to request you to pro vide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered, and damages awarded by the Admiralty- Court, and in other cases wnere in is oov ernment may be acknowledged to be li able in principle, and where the amount of that Lability has been ascertained iy an informal arbitration. The proper offi cers of the Treasury have deemed them selves required by the law of the United States upon the subject, to demaud a tax upon tne incomes oi foreign consuls iu this country; while such a demand and instructions may not be an indication of public law, or perhaps of any existing treaty between tne nuea states arm foreign countrv. The expediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such Consuls a are not citizens of the United States, derive from the emoluments of their office, ot from property not situated in tne Lnitea States, is submitted to your serious con sideration. I make this suggestion upon the p-round that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our Consuls in all other countries from taxation to the extent thus indicated. The United States. I think, ought not to be except ionablv illiberal to international trade and commerce. The operations of the Treasury during the last year have been successfully con ducted. The enactment by Congress of a National Banking. Law baa proved valuable support of the public credit, and tne general ickibi tiuu iu imuvu has fully answered the expectation of its favorers. Some amendments may be re quired to perfect existing laws, but no change in their principles or general scoDe is believed to be neeueu. aince these measures have been in operation all demands on the Treasury, including pay of the army and navy, have been prompt ly met and fully satisfied. No consider able body of troops, it is believed, were ever more amply provided and more lib erally and punctually paid, and it may be added that by no pepole were tne our dens incident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne. The receipts during the year from all sources, including loans and' balance in the Treasury at its com mencement, were $001,125,674 80; the ag gregate disbursement j.syo.1 vo.oau oo v c. . . ... c t i tart leaving a balance on tneitnoi juiy.icoo of 5.329.044 21: of the receipts there were derived from customs 69,0o,64i 40: from internal revenue $37,640, 1 87 95 from direct taxes $1,485,103 61: from lands $167,617 17: from miscellaneous sources $3,046,615 35; and from loans $776,682,361 57; making the aggregate $901,125,674 86. Of the disbursements there were $231,539 22: for pensions, etc. $4,216,520 59; for interest on public debt $34,729,846 51; for War Department $599, 298,600 83; for the Navy Department $63,211,105 27; for payment of funded and terrmorarv debt, $18,186,635 07; making an aggregate of $895,766,630 65, and leav ing a balance of $5,329,055 21; but the payment of the funded and temporary debt having been made from monies bor rowed during the year, must be regarded as merely nominal payments, and the monies borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts, and their amount $181, 086,635 07 should therefore be deducted both from the receipts and disburse ments. This being done, there remains as actual receipts $714,709,995 58, leaving the balance as already stated. The actu al receipts and disbursements for the first quarter, and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three nnarters of the current fiscal year of 1864 will be shown in detail by the report the Secretary of the Treasury, to wbicn invite your attention. It is sufficient say here that it is not believed that the actual result will exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the estimates of that officer heretofore. submitted while it is confidently expect ed that at the close of the year both dis bursements And debt will be found very considerably less than has been anticipa ted. .

The duties de volving on the naval branch of the ser vice during the year, and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eminent suc cess. The extensive blockade Las been constantly increasing in efficiency, as the navy ha expanded. Yet not so long a line it has so far been impossible to en tirelv surnrtss illicit trade. From there- turns received at the Navv Detainment it appears that more than one thousand vessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted, and that the val ue of t rizes already tent in for adjudica tion, amount to over $13,000,000. The naval force of the United States consists. at this time, of 588 vessels, completed and in the course of completion; and ot tnese 75 are iron-clad armored steamers, ine events of the war gives an met eased m terest and importance to the navy, which will prolmbly extend beyond tne war it self. The aimoied vessels in our navy completed and in service, or which are under contract and approacinng comple tion, are believed to exceed iu number those of any other Power; but while these may be lelied upou for haibor defence and sea coast survey, others of greater ptrength and capacity will I necessary for cruizing purposes, and to maintain our rightful position ou the ocean. The change that lias taaen i m.e u i Val vessels anu naval wantne since iue introduction of steam as a motive jower . i t . : .1. fur ship of war. demands either a corres ponding change in some of our existing navy yards, or trie esiabiisnuieni oi new ones, lor Itie construction anu nnvwsr; retail of modem war vessels. o incon siderable embanaa-ment, delay and pub lic injury hsa betn expel ienced from the want of such Government establishments. The necessity of such navy yaids so fur nished at some suitable place iiton tne Atlantic seaboaid, has ou repeated occa sions, been brought to the attention of Corigieas by the Navy Department, and is again piesented in the report of the Sec retary, which accompanies this communi cation. 1 think it my duty toinvitejour special attention to this subject, and also . . . , ! 1 - - - 1 .

A naval force nas neencreaieu on these interior waters and under many disadvantages within little or more than two years, exceeding in numbeis the wnoie naval force of the country at the cot- mencement of the present Administra tion. Satisfactory and important as have been the performance of the heroic men of the Navv at this interesting period. they are scarcely more wondeiful than the services of our mechanics and artizans in the production of war vessels which have created a new form of naval power. Our country haa advantages superior to any other nation in our resources of iron aod timber with inexhaustible qualities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of bot U, aad all accessible, and in close proximity, to navigable waters, without tne advantage of public works. The resources of the nation have been developed, and its pow er displayed in the construction of a nary of such magnitude, and which at the very period of its creation, tendered signal ser vice to the Union. The increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7.000 men in the spring of 1801, to about 24,000 at the present time, has been accomplished without especial legislation or extraordinary bounties to promote that increase. It has been lound. However, that the operation of the draft with high bounties paid for army recruits is be ginning to affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if not corrected, be likely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from the proper vocation and in ducing them to enter the army. 1 there fore respectfully suggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval ser vice by adequate provision on this sub ject, which would at the same time oe even to the communities more especiauj interested I commend to your consideration the auffirestion of the Secretary of the Navy, in regard to the policy of fostering and training icsiuen ior n.iu n,.o. Naval Academy is rendering signal ser vice in preparing midshipmen for highly responsible duties, which in after life they will be reouired to perform in order that the country should not be deprived of iu proper quota of educated officers, for which legal provision haa been made at the Naval School. The vacancies caused bv neelect cr omission to make nomina tions from the States in insurrection have been filled bv the"6ecretarv of the &avy The school is now more full and complete than at amy previous period, and in every respect entitled to the lavorabie consia era tion of Congress. During the past fiscal year the finan rial condition of the Poet Office Depart ment has been one of increasing prosper ity, and I am gratified in being able to state that the receipts of postal revenue have nearly equalled the entire expeai tn res. the latter amounting to eleven mil lion three hundred and fourteen thousand dollars and eighty-four cents, and the for mer to eleven million one hundred and sixty-three thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine dollars and nine cents, leav ing a deficiency of but oue hundred and thirtv thousand four hundred and seven teen dollars and twenty-five cents. In 1860, tVio vpsr immediately preceding the re bellion, the deficiency amounted to $5, fiSfi 705.47: the postal receipts of that year being $2,645,722,19 less than those of leoo. t he decrease since low in iue an nual amount of transport ion has been only about 25 per cent, but the annual expenditures on account of the same, has been reduced do per cent, it ismanue&t, therefore, that the Post Office Depart ment may become self sustaining in few years even with the restoration of the whole service. The International Confer ence of Postal Delegates from the princi pal countries of Lurope and America, which which was called at the suggestion of the Post Master General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last, and concluded its deliberations on the stb of June, ine principles established by the conference aa hest adapted to facilitate postal inter course between nations, and as a basis future conventions to inaugurate a gener al system of uniform international cnar gea at reduced rates of postage, and can not fail to produce beneficial results. I re fer you to the report of the Secretary the interior, wmcn is nerewitn laiu fore you, for useful and varied informa tion in relation to public lands, Indian af fairs, patients, pensions, and other mat ters of public concern pertaining to his daDartment.

This )pol'cy has received its most signal and beneficent illustration in the recent en actment granting homesteads to actual settlers. Since, the first of January last the before mentioned quality of one mil lion four hundred and fifty-six thousand five hundred and fourteen acres of land as been taken up under it provision. This fact, and the amount of sales, lur- nish gratifying evidence of the increasing settlement upon public lands, notwith standing the great struggle iu which the energy of the nation has been engagea, and which bus require.! so large with drawal of our citizt-ns from their aecus- tfcitneil pursuit. I cordially concur in the recomniendatiou ot the secretary ot tne Interior, suggesting a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in the mili tary and naval service of the L mted Mates. doubt not that congress win cneenuuy adopt such measures as will, without es sentially changing the general features of the system, secure to tne greatest practic ed extent its benefits to those who have left their homes in defense of the coun try in this arduous crisis. I invite your attention to the views of the Secretary of War as in the propriety of raising by gppropritt ton of the Legislature, a reve nue from tlit-.mineral lands of the L mttl States. ' The measures provided at vor.r last see sion for the removal oi certain inaian tribes have been carried into effect. Sun dry treaties have been negotiated, which will in due time e submitted for the con stitutional action of the Senate. They contain stipuhitious for extinguishing the possessors rights or Hie ' Indians to large and valuable tracts of land. It is probable that the effect of these treaties will re sult in the establishment of permanent friendly relations with such of those tribes as have been brought into frequent and bloody collisions with ouroetivrog set tlement ami emigrants. Should policy and -our imperative duty to these wards of Government demand our anxious and constant attention to their material well being, to their progress in the arts of civ ilization, and above all to that moral train- ng which under the blessing of Divine Providence will conler npon them eleva ting and sanctifying influences, and hopes and consolations of the christian faith.

The attention of tongres during in . , . . . last session was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communications between the Mississippi river .and the North-eastern sea board. which proposition, how.ver, failed for the time. Since' then, upon a call of the greatest respecUbility, a Convention has been held at Chicago upon tne same subiect: a summary of whose views, in memorial addressed to the President and Congress, which I now have the lion or to lay before you. That this interest is one which, ere long, w ill lone its own way. 1 do not entertain a uouot. wnue it is submitted entirely to your w isdom as to what can be done now. Augmented in terest is given to this subject by the actu al commencement of work upon the Pa cific Railroad under auspices so favorable to its rapid progress and completion that enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road. I transmit the second arrnual retort oi the Commissioner of the Department ol Agriculture, asking your attention io the developments in that vital interest of the nation. When Congress assembled a year ago, the war bad already lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been many con- Mlicta on both Be and land, with varying results. The rebellion had Deen pressea back into reduced limits, yet the tone of public feeling and opinion at home- and abroad was not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections then just past, indicated uneasiness among our selves, while amid much that was cold and menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accent of pity that we were too btTnd to surrender. Our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built npon and furnish ed from foreign ahores, and we were threatened with such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise the blockade. We had failed to elicit from European Gov ernment anything hopetnl upon this sub ject. The Emancipation rrociamation which was issued in beptenioer, was run ning its assigned period to the beginning of the New Year. A month later the fi nal proclamation came, including the an nouncement that colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war service. The policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers, gave to the future a new aspect, about which, hope, and fear and doubt contended in uncer tain conflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil administra tion, the government had no lawful pow er to affect emancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that rebellion could be suppressed wun- out resorting to it as a military measure. It was all the while deemed possible that necessity for it might come, and that if should, the crisis of the contest would be then presented. It came and was inten ded. It was followed by dark and doubt ful days. Eleven months having been passed, we are permitted to take another review. The Rebel borders are pressed still further back, and by the complete opening of the Mississippi river, the country dominated over by the rebellion, is divided into distinct parts without practical communication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been sub statially cleared of the insurgents' control and influence, and the citizens of each and owners of slaves and advocates ot slavery at the beginning of tue rebellion, now onenly declare lor emancipation their respective States. Of those States not included in the Emancipation Proc lamationMaryland and Missouri net ther of which, years ago, would tolerate any restraint upon .the extension of slave ry into the new territories, only dispute now aa the best mode of removing from within their own limits. Of those who were slave at the beginning of the rebellion, full one hundred thousand are now in the United States military serv ice, about one-half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage of taking so much la bor from the insurgent cause, and supply ing the places which otherwise must filled with so many white men. So far a tested, it is difficult to say that they are not aa pood soldiers a any. No servile insurrection, or tendency to violence erueltw baa marked the measures mancipation, or arming the black, it it Tiifse measures have teen much discuss ed in foreign cx-untries.snd contt niporsry with 'uch discus-ion the tone of public snl!nicnt theie is much improved. At lionta the same measures have been fully dii-cussed. supi orted. criticised and de nouuctd, and the annual elections follow ing are h'ghly encouraging to those whose duty it !. to pilot the eruntty through this great trial. Thus we have the reck rning. The crisis which threatened to d. tiried the friends of the Union is past. Looking now to ihe present rnd future. and with rt-feience to a resumption of the Xational authority within the States h that aniboritv has been suspended. I have thought fit to issue a proclamation a copv of which is herewith transmitted. On examination of this proclamation it will appear, as is believed, amply justified by the Constitution. True the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. A man is only promisea a par don in case he voluntarily takes the oath The Constitution authorizes the Execu the to grant it on these tetms, as is fully established bv judicial and other author ities, it is also otiered mat n mauv oi the States named, a real government shall be in the mode prescribed eet up, sucu government shall be recognized and guar anteed by the United States, and that under it the State shall on the constitu tional conditions be protected against in vasion and domestic violence. Ihe con stitutional obligations of the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union, a republican form of government, and to protect the State in the cases stat ed, is explicit and full ; but why tender the benefit ol this provision oniy to a State Government set up in this particu lar wavT This section of the Constitution contemplates a case wherein the elements within a State tavoraoie to a rtepuoucaii Government in the Union, may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to and even within tne aiate, and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing. An attempt lo guarantee and protect a revised State Government constructed in whole or in preponderating part tTom the very ele ment against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply absurd. There must be a test to separate opposing elements, so as ti -build only from the sound, and that test is a sufficient liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness. But if it be proper to re quire as a test of admission to the- poiiti ojil hod v an oath of allegiance to the Con stitution of the United States and to the Union under it, why also to laws end proclamation in regard to shivery? Those laws and proclamation were enaeted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them their fullest effect, there had to be a riledce for their maintenance. In my judgement they have aided and will fur ther aid the cause for wmcn tuey were enlisted. To give p this principle would be not only to relinquish a leverof power, but would also be a cruel and as- r . , i i r -.i t a. ... tOUnding MeaCIl Ol lailU. A uiay auu pi this point, that while 1 remain in my present position I shall not attempt to re tract or modiiy tne truancipaTvon rrociu mation. nor shall I return to slavery any nerson who i free bv the term of the Proclamation, or by any act of Congress For theee and other reasons it is thought best that the support of these persons shall be included in the otith, and it is be lieved tha executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of protected rights, which he has wear con stitutional power to withold altogether or irrant noon the terms which be shall deem wisest for the public interest. It should be observed, also, that this part of the oath ia subject to the modifying and ab rogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision. The proposed acquies- cence of the National Executive in any honorable temporary State arrangement for the freed people, is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States. It -is hoped that the already deeply sfflicted people in those States may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affic tion. and to this extent, this vital matter is left to themselves, while no power of the National Executive to pervert an abuse is abridged by the proposition. The suggestion in the Proclamation as to maintaining the political framework ol the States, or what is called reconstruc tion, is made in the hope that it may do good without the danger ol harm, ii will save labor and avoid great confusion, but why any proclamation now upon the subject? This question is beet with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long, or be taken too soon. In some, elements for resumption seem ready for action, but remain inactive, ap parently for want of a rallying point plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B, rather than B that of A, and if A and B should agree, how can they know that the general Government here will respect their plan ? By the Proclamation a plan ia presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in ad vance will not be rejected here. This inay bring them to the act sooner than they otherwise would. The objection to to a premature presentation of plan by the National Executive, consists in the danger of commitment in points which could be more safely left to lurther devel opements. Care has been taken to shape the document so aa to avoiu em oar rasa- ment from- this source, in saying that on certain terms certain classes will be por-j tinned with their rights restored. It not said that other classes on other terms will never be included, in saying that reconstruction will be accepted it tTfev in a specified way; it is not said lhai it will never be accepted in any other The movements by State actions for emancipation in several of the States included in the Emancipation Procla-eDt mation are matters of profound congrat- ulation, and while I do not repeat in ue- tail what I have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this subject, my general view and feelings remain unchanged, and trust that Congress will omit no fair op- portunity of aiding these important steps to the great consummation. Io the midst of other cares however important, must not lose sight of the fact that the r.r r.owpr ia atill our main reliance. To that power alone can we look yet for time to give confidence to the people the contested regions that the insurgent the contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them, cn r.. . , , - it i wi:i.a.i til that confidence suaii ue wiunoiu, little can be done anywhere for what called re-construction ; hence our care must still be directed to our army and navy, who have thus far borne their, harder part so nobly and wen; ana it may be esteemed fortunate that in giving greatest efficiency to their indispensable - JA .Ua Virtntrahltf PlltVllirftJ. axilla, no muj uwuw.wv. , . - c .. . 1- 1 . . gallant men, irom commauuer i cun- 1 who romnoso them, and to whom more than all others tne wona must stand indebted for the home of freedom, disenthralled, regeneratea, enmrseu . , , 1 perpetuated. aigneaj a. i-i.twi.it., Washington, lec o, isoj.

Chronicle I have delayed writing until now, that I might be enabled to fur nish an accurate list of the killed and wounded in the two companies from Trasa bull County; also the full particulars ood. oerning the part our regiment took in the late battle. We have won a great victory, and can think nor talk of nothing else. Even the wounded soldier forgets for the moment, his sufferings, while he coatemplates the great work hahsa, with, his fellow soldiers, accomplished. Letrn briefly give you a general ide of it po sition of our force prior to the engage ment, and then refer more prticulirly to our regiment. Lookout Mountain is three mils from town, next the river, and terminate In a bluff 500 feet high, and has been occupied by the rebels since the battle of Chlcka manga. It commanded both the railroad, and the river; thus we were prevented from getting our supplies through this channel, and as the roads had became impassable, something must he done, or our army would soon be in a starving on. dition. Gen. Hooker was on our right, below Lookout Mountain, Gen. Granger in the center, and in front of Chattanooga, while Gen. Sherman, on the north side of the river, was on the left. On the,23d inst., at ly P. M., our center moved out one mile, and drove the jebel picket from their position. On the 24th we ad vanced still farther, while our batteries took an active part in the engagement. At the same time Hooker stormed", and gallantly carried the works on Lookout Mountain. The musketry firing wa kept up until 12 o'clock at night. : We have taken 2,000 prisoner, with a loss to our selves of 250 killed and wounded. While this battle was occupying the attention of the enemy, Gen. Sherman hastily threw a pontoon bridge across the river, seven miles above, and crossed hi whole Yore, thus getting in the rear of the right wing of Bragg' army. ' Thus on the evening of the 24th, Gen. Hooker had taken Look out Mountain, Gen. Hazen's brigade Lad captured a regiment of Alabamians, while Gen. Sherman waited for the order to at tack the enemy's fLink; nor had he long to wait, for on the 25th day, which-' wild ever be memorable in the hutory of the rebellion, the order was received to attack the enemy, but the position was too strong, aand we were repulsed twice, with considerable loss. While this attack. being made, our center again advanced, and took some rifle-pit near the ba of Missionary Ridge. This Ridge U three miles from town, and is in full, view' for several milea. Bragg' Headquarters we located there, directly in front of our brigade, aa It then stood at the foot of the Mountain, in line of battle. The center was ordered to advance up that Ridge, and take some rifle-pits and there rest until further orders. They obeyed the order, so far as taking the rifle-pits wa concerned, but (Asy tiW ot stop tZfrtfvr or itr. Tbey chaiged .right up thw stewp Mountain side, rifht up to the very mouths of the rebel guns. SuiiJmg at Fort Wood wa eould see tie whole thing. A more grand or sublime sight has never been presented to view, since the war be gan. The long line of soldiers, with tc colors of each regiment , floating to the breeze, can be seen toiling siowly, but ateadily. up, up, while from forty pieoa ofmer, the enemy fined their shot and shell into the lines of our br.ve hoy; stilll they waver not, but more on, on, to ward what seems most certain Jc.Uue tion. Our batteries in our rear, thunder ed forth their missies of destruction at the enemy, thus forming a roof of smoke and iron hail for our soldiers, w ho atill move on and upward: but see the line has halted; they full hick to the breast works; Gen. Sherdan rides up and a. 'That' right, boys; you done ju?t rtgbt; you couldn't go up there alone.". Then, after they bad breathed a few moments, the command rings ou "forward," when very man springs to his feet and again presses forward. The panic-stricken en emy throw down their arms, and while hundred escape, many with hand up lifted, rush towards our line , and gave themselves up. Col Uarker the noble commander of our brigade .iezea a flag, and in advance of the rest, is soon astride the gun ''Lady Buckner." shouting, 'rally round the flag boys," while one of the soldiers of our regiment is soon beside him, aud begs leave to turn the gun ou the flying enemy, which he doe wiu good effect. Col. Opdycke exhibited hi accustomed bravery, laughing at the fear of some, or with revolver in hand threaten ing to shoot down the coward who sought to skulk away to a place of safety. The Colonel commanded a demi-brigade, and I am happy to say that none from our regi ment were threatened with his revolver. It was CoL Opdycke's command that cap tured Gen. Bragg's headquarters, and eight piece of artillery. The CoL had two horse shot under him. but came cut i of the conflict unscratched. We all feel proud of such a commander, ana will lol low. or go at hi bidding anyioher. Capt. Bates, of Company C. commanded our regiment, which formed a part of CoL Op dyck's command. Capt. B. is a brave and conscientious man, and highly esteemed ly all who know him. That night the camp fire of Lookout Mountain, and Visionary Ridce were kindled by Union ! soldiers, and aa they gathered round to ! cook their coffee, and eat their hard bread, and talked over the scenes and incidents 1 of th day. they grasped each other by the hand, as friends who have long been separated. Ah, their day' work will form one of the brightest page in the history of our country, and will it not hasten the time w hen all our enemies thail be conquered, end we be permitted to return to noma and friend again TV,. 1m.
