"J 1 i it it 1 THEY DON'T OAREi Gorernor and Attorney General Not Alarmed by Threats. So Law Under Which They Could Be Ousted From Office. MAY TRY TO IMPEACH. Wichita People Say They Hare Evidence Against Iloch. Claim He Promised to CoaniTe at Violation of Law. Caa Produce Witnesses Agreement, They bay. to "I'm not bothering my head by even thinking about it," said Oovernor E. W. Hoeh today. 'I have not a word to say in regard to this matter except that they can lire away at me whenever they get ready." said C. C. Coleman, the attorney gen eral. . These were their replies and all that they would say In response to queries concerning their attitude about the plans which are forming in Wichita, according to stories emanating from that place, to bring suits to oust them from office tor their failure to enforce the prohibitory law of the state. This is a retaliatory scheme on the part of the Wichitans for the suit which the attorney genera; has filed to oust Find lay Ross, from the office of mayor of Wichita, because cf his faiure to en force the prohibitory law in that city and his connivance with its violation. In this connection one thing is cer tain, however, and that Is that neither the governor or the attorney general can be ousted from office through the means of suits similar to the one brought with success by Mr. Coleman against former Mayor Kose of Kansas City. Kan., and James Gibson, the for mer county attorney of Wyandotte county, and the similar ones he has filed against Mayor Koss and the mayors of ether cities. There is nothing in the prohibitory law which specifically places its enforcement on the governor and the attorney general. Of course under their oaths of office they are required to see to the enforcement of all the laws cf the state and the only way they could be ousted from office would be by impeachment proceedings for maifessance which -would have to originate in and be determined by the state legislature. They cannot be removed from office, as stated, through suits brought in the su preme court in the same manner as those which have been brought by the attorney general against delinquent ifiaj-ors. - . . A glance at the section of the, pro1 hibitory law which provides penalties for its" nonenforcement on public offi cials shows that the governor and the 'attorney general are not included in the list. This section reads: "It shall be the duty of all sheriffs,, deputy sheriffs, constables, mayors, marshals, police judges and police offi cers of any city or town having notice or knowledge of any violation of the provisions of this act, to notify the county attorney of the fact of such vio lation, and furnish him with the names of any witnesses within his knowledge by whom such violation can be proven. If any such officers shall fail to compls w-ith the provisions of this section, he shall upon conviction be fined in any sum, not less than one hundred nor more than five hundred dollars; and such conviction shall be a forfeiture of the office held by such person, and the court before whom such conviction is had shall, in addition to the imposition cf the fine aforesaid, order and adjudge the forfeiture of his said office. For a failure or neglect in the enforcement of this act, any of the city or county officers herein referred to may be re moved by civil action." It was under the last sentence of this section that Mr. Coleman brought the quo warranto suits against Rose and Gibson, and the similar ones against Mayor Ross of Wichita and the mayor of other cities which are now pending in the supreme court and to which none of the defendants have as yet filed any answers. They have until December 20 to do so. Legal lights around the state house insisted today that these sorts of suits could not be brought under the pro hibitory or any other law against Gov. Wnch and Mr. Coleman. There was only one way to remove them from office and that was by impeachment. It would hardly pay, and would hard 1v bp nossible to bring an impeachment suit against Mr. Coleman as he Is to re- tire fmm office so soon, in governor Hoch's case it is different and a Wich ita man who was in town today said that the people of that city would see that the proper proceedings were brought in an effort to oust him from office In fact this man went so far as to say tr-at an Impeachment reso lution against Governor Hoch would be presented during the first week ot the legislative session and pressed to a conclusion of some sort. The grounds on which this proceed ing will be based are that the gover- ! nor and the attorney general have not ; only condoned the violations of the prohibitory law in Wichita and other ' places, but that they have actually -.een narties to the violations In that j they have conspired to that end with certain politicians. In this conspir acy, which, it is said, is to be charged against the governor, he is said to have made pledges that under certain conditions he would not take notice of the violations of the prohibitory law in Wichita. The Wichltan, who was here today, said that a banker and two prominent business men of Wichita were willing to take the stand and swear that the governor had told them prior to election that he would not interfere with the way the liquor question wan handled by Wichita unless there was -some un usual demand from the people of that section for the strict enforcement of These men claim that the miit brought by the attorney general, with as he has stated, the knowledge of Governor Hoch. is a violation of the governor's pledge and that the gov ernor is as open to cen.snre for the violations of the prohibitory law in Wichita as any local official.

"Yes, I did it, I ! am the murderer of Dona Oilman." j Coolly and without the slightest sign of emotion or remorse, David Curtis early today made the above confession I to the prosecuting attorney. The statement of Curtis was as fol lows: j "On the evening of November 20, I ate supper in the Cadillaic restaurant ! on Fifth street. Just as I came out I saw Dona Gilman waiting for her car ! and I also boarded the car. At Nation- al and Groveland avenues. I alighted. Shortly after the car had started up the hill and as she took the west side of the street I followed up the hill on the . east side. I then committed the as sault." FIGHT TO THE FINISH. General Coleman Says There Will Be No Compromise in Ouster Suits. "There will be no compromise in the ouster suits I have brought against the mayors of cities where the prohibitory law is violated openly." This is the reply of C. C. Coleman, th attorney general, to the suggestion that there might be a compromise in these nuits If the mayors of the cities saw that the law was enforced from now on. It has been stated that the friends of the mayors of Wichita and Junction City were going to try and compromise matters with the attorney general so as to stave off the ouster suits until after their terms of office expire in the spring. They have had no comiTiunication with the attorney general as yet, he says, and in view of his statement tney win not get much satisfaction If they do open up com-1 munlcation iWith him FT NEW LAW. Grain Inspector John Radford Discusses Adrerse Decision. Expects Report of Special Master to Bb Affirmed. POLLOCK WILL HELP. United States Judge to Point Out Defects In Law. New Act Will lie Framed in Accord With His Decision. John Radford, the state grain inspec tor was In the city yesterday when he received word that S. R. Peters, spec ial master in the case to abolish grain inspection and grain weighing by the state, had reported that the law is un constitutional. This report, of course, has to be affirmed by Judge Pollock. And formal exceptions will be made to the report by Senator James F. Getty, who has been the attorney for the state in the proceedings. But Mr. Radford believes that one of the first acts of the coming legislature ought to be the pass ing of an amended grain inspection law which will meet the objections that maintain against the present act. "That is the kind of a report we ex pected," said Mr. Radford. "Judge Pol lock said the same thing when the case j. 0 i the law' ameancfeT bvSrhe next" lisTa! ture. The grain dealers have been mak- ing a hard fight to get control of this business and they have been spending a great deal of money. The final decis ion in the case will probably not be rendered before the legislature meets and another law will be enacted at once. Judge Pollock has said that he will point out the defects in the pres ent statute if he rules against us and we can use the decision to guide us In framing the new law." Go to a Higher Court. Kansas City, Kan., Dec. 7. "We will file a bill of exceptions to the report of S. R. Pet?rs. special master in the Kan sas grain weighing case," said James F. Getty, attorney for the Kansas state g'liin inspection department, yesterday. "The report of the special master will he presented to Judge Pollock of the United Siati-s circuit court for approval. Should he sustain the master's report we will then appeal to the United States circuit court of appeals. We feel that the Kansas state law relating to the weighing cf grain will be upheld."

FIRE AT CORNELL. Chapter House of the Chi Psi Fraternity liurns. Four Students and Three Fire men Are Dead. THE LOSS IS HEAVY. It Was the Most Elaborate Chapter House in U. S. Blaze Started in Kitchen From Unknown Cause. Ithaca, r. T., Dec. 7. Early this morning the beautiful Chi Psi fraterni ty house at Cornell university caught Are and soon was all aflame. Before the fire department could arrive O. L. Schmuck of Hanover, Pa., had jumped from a third stcry window and was so severely injured that it is feared he will die. Three of Ithaca's volunteer firemen were killed while fighting the flames. Four students He in the infirmary at the point of death. It Is not known how many are In the ruins. The chapter house , was a mansion built by Mrs. Jennie McGraw Kiske on "r, L, k 1 Cayuga, lake. iQUt never - OCCUnied bv hpr hz-anoo. rC ! Premature death. It wMalSiu. r,u structure of sandstone, handsomely decorated and finished within with maroie ana ' manogany. The walls, wnlch were ot . rubble masonry, col lapsed under the flames and high wind, leaving only a heap of ruins. The firemen killed were: - A. S. ROBINSON, a lawyer and graduate of Cornell. r ESTY LANDON. ' JOHN RUMSEY. They were manipulating a hose on the north side of the building when the wall collapsed on them and pinned them to the ground, to slowly roast un der the burning debris. When the fire department arrived, the screams of two men appearing in the windows of the southwest tower, over the main entrance, were heard. For some reason the men hesitated to jump and before they could be reached, the tower collapsed and the men were buried beneath the ruins. The chapter house burned rapidly and the walls cracked apart in all di rections. The fire was bo hot that the firemen were driven from the south east side of the building. .. . President Schurman of Cornell and his staff are' preparing a. list of wound ed and missing. Among those taken from th-e ruins were J. M. McOutchecm of Pittsburg, the football fallback su IV. Those taken out were in pitiable conditions. They were b!e6Si-r,r : ' j'om cuts. caused by falling bricks and) timbers -and black ened by -smoke. Several of them were baily burned. . C. J. Pope, a freshman member of the fraternity, is missing and is- sup posed to be under the ruins. r AT- present it is lmpossioie to learn ! f rom what town or city he halls. Many Luit?ins -t uim oupAJuaeu lu imsst Illg Lire usrilis Ulicu x. uliici xia- ternity houses. Schmuck afterward died in the in- firmary, making the list of probable dead six including the three volunteer firemen. W. V. Goetz is not dead; only in- jured. F. W. Grelle of Orange, N. J., a freshman, is supposed to be among the dead. The fire started at 8:30 o'clock in the kitchen in the basement of the chapter house. The flames had gained con siderable headway before the student occupants were awakened. Ajs soon as the flames burned into the basement hall and stairway the halls throughout the house became filled with dense smoke. In the rooms and upper floor were 27 students. It was not possible for them to escape from the halls and they went to the windows. As the Are approached the rear of the building the students were forced to jump and several were seriously injured in this way. No alarm was turned in until half an hour after the fire had been discovered and it was half an hour later before the volunteer fire department could get to work. It was a long climb from the lower part of the city to the college grounds and by the time the firemen arrived the interior of the building was almost burned out. They could do nothing but prevent adjoining buildings from taking fire. Rumsev. Landon and Robertson, the Ithaca volunteer firemen, had managed to train a hose on the north side of the house when the wall tottered. There was a cry of alarm and several men standing near managed to get out of the way but the three named were caught under the mass of debris and killed. President Schurman of Cornell unl- versity, in a statement given out this , afternoon, said: "Most of the members of Chi Psi fraternity slept in the third story of the burned buildings and all except two managed to get out of the build ing alive. The two who are missing and who it is assumed perished in the flames are W. H. Nichols of Chicago, and F. W. Greel of South Orange, N J. Although Mr. O. L. Schmuck of Hanover, Pa., got out of the building he went back for his room mate, Mr. jniurpd namelv. J. M. McCutcheon of Pittsburg and C. J. Pope of Last Orange, N J. Three other students were slightlv injured: they are R. R. Powers of Atlanta. Ga.; W. W. Goetz of Milwaukee, and H. M. Curry, jr., of Pittsburg. "Besides the death and injury of the above mentioned three students of the fire department of the city of South Ithaca, namely, A. S. Robert son, John Rumsev and E. J. Landon, were instantly killed by the falling of the north wall of the burnins- build ing. The origin of the fire is un known." To Investigate Walsh Failure. Chicago, Dec. 7. United States Dis trict Attorney Sims announced today that on December 17 a federal "ferand jury will commence an investigation of the causes contributing to the failure last year of the Chicago National bank of which John R. Walsh was president. 

SUL1L1ED UP. A Committee Ileports on the San Franciseo Disaster. Total Area Burned Over Was 3,000 Acres. OR 4.7 SQUARE MILES. Number of Buildings 25,000, Valued at 350,000,000. Amount of Insurance Carried Was $235,000,000. San Francisco, Cal., Dec. 7. The re port of the special committee of the board of trustees of the Chamber of Commerce on insurance settlements af ter the big fire which has just been published says: "The total area burned was about 3,000 acres or about 4.7 square miles, containing 520 blocks and about 25,000 buildings, one-half of these were resi dences. "The amount of insurance covering property in the burned district was ap proximately J235.000.000, estimated. All cf this had- been written by companies authorized to do business in the state except $6,000,000 which had been placed outside of the state in some 100 com panies. The value or Duuaings ana con- j tents destroyed in the Are must have heen nbn'it S350 000.000. being an esti mate upon the insurance liability, the known ratio of insurance to value, about 70 per cent, and a guess that there was about 5 per cent of property that car ried no insurance. 'An immense sum of insurance has been paid into this city, a far larger sum than companies have ever been call ed upon to pay at one time before. In spite of the earthquake, in spite of the nearness in time of the Baltimore and Toronto conflagrations, the companies will finally have paid undoubtedly in the neighborhood of SO per cent of the amount of insurance involved. At Chi cago there was 50 per cent paid; in Bal timore 90 per cent." AS BRYAN SEES IT. A Criticism of Parts or Mr. Roosevelt's Message. Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 7 Commenting on President Roosevelt's message William J. Bryan says it contains some things that ought to rsise severe criticism. The president boldly appropriates some of the doctrines w:hich the Democrats have been advocating, and on the other hand ha announces some doctrines which are so absurd as to excite amusement if the suggestions came from a less prom inent source. In some, cases he takes advanced ground; in some cases he re treats from the ground already taken. Mr. Bryan complains that what the president says on the subject of govern ment by injunction will not be satis- fnrtnrv in t.h laboring men or to those ; wno respect the right of trial ty jury, ; The president's -stand on child laboris commenaea, as is tusu me puaitiun jic taKes Oil Llie Clgni-iiuui ian diiti iiic right of the people to criticise a judge. Mr. Bryan deplores what he calls the : president's warlike attitude. He says I in conclusion : - "There will be general disappointment at the warlike tone of his message where he discusses the army and navy. He speaks of the navy as the surest guarantor of peace which this country possesses. Shame upon the chief exec utive that he should place an instru ment of brute force above the nation's sense of justice as a guarantor of peace! The best guarantor of peace is our na tion's purpose to deal justly with other nations. War ought to be a last re sort, not a first consideration. It is bad enough to have a few professional soldiers. It is not necessary that the whole nation shall be keyed up all the time to the fighting point." 

FIRE AT NEW .CAMBRIA. Destroys Union Pacific Depot, General Store and Lodge Rooms. New Cimbria, Kan., Dec. 7. A fire ' which started some time during last night but smouldered until the building was opened at 6:30 this morning de stroyed the two story general store of ; Mrs. C. C. Root and the Union Pacific depot at this place, entailing a loss of ! from $12,000 to J15.000. ! How the fire started is unknown, but smoke was noticed pouring out of the j building at 6:30 this morning and ; when a rush was made to open the store the flames had gained such head- ; way that It was impossible to save any j of the contents of the store. The Union Pacific depot occupied a ! portion of the building. Some of their : SVlegrap h wir e Ice throhtbi office contents were saved but the main office was destroyed for the time. Anot: er heavy loss was to the lodges on the second floor. The order of the Knights of the Golden Eagles had sev eral hundred dollars worth of notes on money loaned which were lost. The fire was confined to this building. The insurance was small. RESPITE FOR 30 DAYS. Aggie Myers nnd Frank Hottman Not to Hang Monday. Kansas City, Dec. 7. Mrs. Aggie Myer3, under sentence to be hanged December 10 for the murder of her husband, has been stlven a respite of thirty days by Governor Folk. A like extension was given to Frank Hott man, under sentence for the same murder. The respite to Mrs. Myers was granted in order that her attorneys may have time in -which to lay her case fully before the United States su preme court in the application for a writ of error, Mrs. Myers is in jail at Liberty, Mo. Frank Hottman is in the county jail here. Hottman was not ttken from the death cell last night, as the official an nouncement of his respite had not been read at the county jail. He was notified of the extension of time, how ever, and declared himself gratified with the governor's action. He had already gone to bed when he heard the news. TO MAKE ALCOHOL Big DistUIery Plant Opens on the De natured Product. Peoria, 111., Dec. 7. The Atlas dis tillery, a property of the American Spirits Manufacturing company, in all probability will open today for the manufacture of denatured alcohol at its full capacity of 8,000 bushels a day.

KN0CK0NREF0RC1 House Committee Will Oppose Simplified Spelling. Appropriation Bill Is to Go in W ith a Proviso. Washington, Dec. 7. The legisla tive, judicial and executive appropria tion bill when reported to the house will contain a positive requirement that the old time spelling shall be used In all printing authorized by congress. The house today passed a bill creat ing a game preserve of nearly 700,000 acres within the Olympic forest reserve in the state of Washington. Representative Southwick (N. Y.) introduced a bill today increasing the salaries of all civil service employes 10 per cent. OFFERSJERf.lS. California Is Willing to Com promise With KooseTeit. On the Basis of a New Treaty With Japan. Chicago, Dec. 7. A dispatch to the Tribune from San Francisco says: California proposes a settlement of the imbroglio with Japan over the San Francisco- school situation on the fol lowing grounds: The federal government to enact a new treaty with Japan, excluding Japa nese coolie labor from the United States and Hawaii, and American labor from Japan. Japanese contract labor importations to cease. Equality in public schools with sep arate schools for adult Japanese desir ing primary and grammar Echoql train ing. A decision by the- United States sru preme court on the-state's right to pass anti-miscegenatton and school laws. The federal government to decide the right of franchise for the Japanese. Keep the question out of the hands of congress. California, although still frothing over President Roosevelt's message, to congress, has begun to quiet down and to study the possible motives behind the utterances of the chief executive. That the president really meant what he said is considered absurd and while part of the people still bitterly declare he was misled, others declare that the message is part of a big diplomatic game and that the president slapped California merely to gain a diplomatic advantage by conciliating Japan. Public men here, probably advised from Washington, are firm in the con viction that President Roosevelt and the Japanese ambassador are framing a new treaty which shall exclude the Japanese coolie class from the United States and American labor from Japan. 

NOTHING IN IT. . . The President Authorizes Denial of New Treaty Negotiations. Washington, Dec. 7. "There is ab solutely nothing in it," said Senator Cullom, chairman of the senate com mittee on foreign relations, on return ing from a visit to the state department today when asked what he knew about a proposed new treaty with Japan. Secretary Root and Viscount Aokt the Japanese ambassador, have flatly denied that such a treaty was in con templation, and a high official of the state department in a position to know all that transpires in his office, today reiterated the statement that nothing of the kind was even thought of. Assistant Secretary Adee, who has been credited with havine been as. signed the task cf preparing such a ! treaty said today: "It is all conjecture. I know abso lutely nothing tending to confirm the report of any such treaty being nego tiated." Assistant Secretary Bacon made a statement in behalf of the presidenl that no steps of any kind had beer) taken or will be taken toward the negotiation of a new treaty with Japan for the exclusion of Japanese laborera The president, Mr. Bacon said, askef that this information be made public,

FORGOERS President of the American Federation of Labor Defeats a Hill Championed by Congressman Littlefield. CALLED IT A GRAFT. Western Members Lined Up Against Pilotage Measure. Kesult .is Charged Up to In fiuence of Labor. Washington, Dec. 7. Pres-Ident Gomp ers, of the American Federation of La bor, got sweet revenge upon Congress man Littlefield, of Maine, yesterday when the pilotage bill was -up for pas sage in the house. Littlefield backed it strong. Gompers was against it. Ha claimed that it was against the inter ests of organized labor. He mustered enough votes to defeat it. Gompers did what he could to defeat Littlefield for re-election this fall, but failed. Mr. Mann, of Illinois, asked whether the bill was not selfish in a degree, and. Mr. Humphrey, of Washington, replied it was selfish in favor ot American ves sels and that the middle west seemed to want no legislation except that which, affected the corn fields. Mr. Minor, of Wisconsin, characteriz ed the present pilotage law as one of the worst species of "graft" in the country. The debnie raged for four hours and a half and the result of the vote was a surprise to the friends of the measure, who openly charged its defeat to the American Federation of Labor. The delegation from California as well as representatives from other western states saw in the bill an opportunity to file a protest against restricting the rights of states to deal with the pilotage question at first hand and they availed themselves of the opportunity to go on record. 

WOULD LIKE TO VOTE. Japanese Would Welcome Opportun ity to Become Citizens. San Francisco, Cal., Dec. 7. In an interview published in the Call today bearing on the recommendations made in Ms message by President Roosevelt on Japanese naturalization and on the segregation of their cnildren in schools. General Uyeno, the consul for Japan here, says: "Sentiment is practically universal among the 10,000 Japanese in San Francisco, that the recommendations J made by the president constitute the j meat rational solution of American i Japanese problems yet attempted, j There-is no question that the bond I between Japan and the United Slates j would be considerably strengthened I by conferring the privilege of fran chise in California. There are some j 50 odd thousand Japanese in Call ; fornia and while I am not in a posl ! tion to say how many of these would take advantage of naturalization priv ileges I do think that the number ! would be comparatively large. "Concerning the school segregation question a lot Js being written and : talked about it that is due to miscon ception of the facts in the case. I ! think that the entire matter will be j solved satisfactorily.
