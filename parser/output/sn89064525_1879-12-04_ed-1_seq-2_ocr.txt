By the accidental explosion of five pounds of powder, at the residence of William Krapo,in Pourie Center parish, La. NOT. 27, Krapo and one child were ser'ously burned, and two of his children, one three and the 'ether six years of age, and grandmother, Mrs, Faber, were killed. BODY SNATCHING. Bennett Jackson was arrested at Chat tanoosa on the morning of Nov 38 for snatch­ ing the body Tennessee Kleth who died on the the night of Nov. 26. The body was packed in a •hoe-box and addressed to Ottawa and said to to contain fresh flsh. On the night of Nov, 97, parties attempted to send the same box to Cincinnati as cotton seed. Bennet Jackson, his son, and the sexton of the cemetery were committed to jail in default of $2,000 bail. GEN. JEFFERSON C. DAVIS. Gem. Jefferson C. Davis, Colonel of the SSd Infantry and Brevet Brigadier General oi the United States army, died in Chicago, 111., of pneumonia on the afternoon of Sunday Nov. #0. He was born in Clark county, In­ diana, March 2,1836, and was therefore near ly 02 years old at the the time of his death, He had gained considerable distinction for meritorious military service. TJTK INDIANS. Dispatches from Los Pinos state that op to Monday, NOT. 34, tho Indians had not returned to that point, though it was reported they were preparing to come in. Ouray said the hostlles were arming, evidently fearing trouble. Dispatches don't indicate the com. mission expect to accomplish much more. It is reported they have fears a campaign has already been arranged, that one column is 10 march from Milky River, one from Utah, and two from the south. The commission is still barricadcd and prepared to resist any attack POISONED BY A STEP-DAUGHTER- Last week at Ephiata, Pa., Mrs. Huber and her six. months old child, were taken violently HI after partakiug of soup. The ttbild died after haviDg spasms, and the moth­ er though considered out of danger, is still confined to her bed. Physicians on examining the stomach of the child, found arsenic in a sufficient quantity to cause death, and at an inquest held this afternoon, a drug clerk tes­ tified to having sold Julia Huber, a step­ daughter to Mrs. Huber, a half ounce of arse­ nic with which she said she wanted to kill rate. INDIAN COMMISSION A FAILURE. On the morning of Nov. 20, at a meet­ ing of the commission at Los Pinos Agency, Col., Ouray reported the arrival, the night be­ fore of a runner from Douglas' camp with the information that owing to the advance of troops the Uintas have left the agency and reservation to join Douglas, prepared to fight, that the White River Utes decline to return and Jack sent word he will not come here un­ til the Uintas trouble is settled. If this is true the work of the commission if ended for the present Some of the commission doubt the report, believing 11 a ruse to gain time, or that Mormons are at the bottom of it. THE PRESIDENT'S THANKSGIVING. President Hayes and Mis. Hayes ar­ rived at Philadelphia the night before Thanks givings day, and on Thanksgiving morning the President with Mrs. Hayes attended the dedicatory services of the Pine street M. E ehurch, Frankfort. The presence of the President and wife was not known until the services were nearly over. Bishop Simpson, at whose house the President and wife are •topping, preached the sermon. Contribu­ tions were received to defray the expenses of remodeling the church, and the President contributed $26. After the services the Pres! dent and Mrs. Ho yes were obliged to hold an informal reception. ROBBED. Mr. Terlon, jeweler of Covington, Ky discovered on the morning os Nov. 27th, that his safe had been robbed of forty geld watches and two pairs of gold bracelets. He remem .m that on the previous afternoon after the goods had been put in the safe, before the safe was locked, two men came in and engag ed him and his clerk In conversation about purchases. Then a man drove to the door and called Mr. Terlon out. While out one of th« men took the tray and passed it out the back way to another confederate, and then re­ turned in time to complete the conversation which had been interrupted. No clue to the thieves has been found. Loss estimated at 98,000 Tho theft had been carefully Dlanned, as Mr. Terlon now remembors previous visits by thes* men. MOUSING MILL BURNED. A serioas conflagration, involving the lose of nearly one hundred thousand dollars worth of property, occured In Oronoco, Olm •ted county. At about 3 o'clock on the morn lag of NOT. 25, thejiarge flouring mill of Good hue and Allis, at that place, took Are at about that hour and was burned to the ground, to getherwith their large warehouse, containing between 40,000 and 60,000-bushels of wheat, and a sawmill adjoining, valued at $300 It is believed that the fire was eaused by an over­ heated box. in some of the machinery on the upper floor where the fire originated, The owners of the mill had put in two new run of rtone and three crushers during the season, and the mill bad a capacity of 200 barrels a at the time of its total destruction. The Ineurance on the same is about one-third of the property destroyed. CONFESSION. A confession lias been received in Ohi esgo from a prisoner at Ballston Spa, New York, to the effect that John Ryan, now in the Michigan penitentiary, and Jno. Lamb, now awaiting trial for murder in Chicago, of Officer Race, were the men who in 1876 com­ mitted the terrible murder at Norway, near La Salle, by which one Burdlck Somsen lost hie life, while defending the lite and property of his friend, old Mr Kepplerfrom burglars. The perpetrators of this outrage have never been discovered. The confession states that Lamb and Ryan were driven by the Ballston Spa prisoner in a wagon from the scene of ths murder, and that from their conversation he knew they had committed the crime. The gambler who put up the job. has been arrest­ ed. Lamb utterly denies any connection with the matter. FATAL ACCIDENT. About 5 o'clock on the evening of *th, a farmer named Joseph Barbetz of Wis coy,Winona county, Minn., with his wife, was. driving across the track of the Milwaukee and 8t' Paul railroad, near the city of Winona, when the wagon was struek by a passenger train. The wagon was cut in two, and Bar. beta was instantly killed and his wife thrown «ome thirty-five feet, caus&g injuries which will probably prove fatal, as the woman was within a month of her confinement. No blame is attached to the train men. Tue train ran a considerable distance beyond the scene of the disaster, but was quickly backed tip and the unfortunates carried to a farm­ house near by, where they were cared for in the beet possible manner. Meanwhile the train returned to Winona and camo back with a surgeon and the oompany's agent at that place, ministering to the wants of .the wound­ ed woman. TORNADO. A fearful tornado played havoc in the southern portion of Louisville, Ky,on the morning of Nov. 88. Those who saw it say that oue immense black cloud came up from the aouthweetatfour minutes to 6 o'clock. It was a black and gloemy spectacle as it near ed the city. It was seen to revolve at a fear hi rate. Directly a dbluge of rain began to tall, lit up by a red electric light It seemed to say to those that witnessed it, that the world was coming to an end, and doubtless people in the track pursued by the whirlwind really thought so. It struck the city at the further end. of Fourth'Street, Rev. Stuart Rob­ inson's houae being one of the first to suffer It continued in a northeasterly direction, leav­ ing theclty at Cave Hill.

APPEAL FOR IRISH 8UFFERERS. An appeal irora Cardinal Manning tor subscriptions to alleviate distress in Ireland was read in all the Catholic churches in Lon­ don Nov. 80—It is stated that in the west of Ireland such hunger, poverty and wftnt are now to be seen aB have never been known since the great Irish famine. A general col­ lection for this purpose is appointed for Sun­ day next LONDON TIMES ON THE MESSAGE. The London Times of Dec. 1, in an editorial discussing the message of President Hayes to Congress, says: "If the legal tender notes in circulation be called in and cancelled silver dollars must take their place •and -the existing plethora be relieved. Further relief will come in due time from the natural action of trade. Money that has flowed in such pro­ fusion from Europe to the United States can­ not always remain thus. Its presence will soon be felt in the rise of prices throughout the Union and as soon as the' rise has been established, a demand for European goods will follow and a current of money from the east to the western shores of the Atlantic will be arrested, if not reversed. A process of this kind cannot be completed within a week or a month, but its development may be articlpat ed as confidently as the movement the tides." PANIC IN A SCHOOL BUILDING. At St. Louis, Mo., between 10 and 11 o'clock on the morning of Nov. 26, fire was discovered in one of the rooms of the ground lioor of the Webster school, corner of Eleventh and Jefferson streets, the largest primary school building in the city. The school fire alarm was immediately struck and teachers and scholars throughout the building were apprised of the danger. The children on the ground floor got out safely and in good order, but those on the upper floors were siezed with a panic, and despite the utmost exertions of. the teachers rushed wildly and shrieking hi terror to the stairways, down which they hurled themselves in the greatest terror and confusion. The pressure was so great on the stairs that between the second and ground floors that the bannisters gave away and sev eral children were precipitated to the floor be low. Ella Luich had an arm broken, Emma Ditten was badly hurt about the head and up per part of the person by the bannister falling on ner, and Eva Shaefer were severely braised. That a score of them was not killed outright is-most remarkable, Mrs. Bottaggar, a teach­ er, in her heroic efforts to stay the rushing tide at'the head of the stairs, was hurled from her feet, trampled upon and borne to the bot­ tom. where she was dragged out very much bruised, but not seriously, and something like order was restored, when it was discovered it was a very trilling affair and soon mastered. The panic was confined to the girls. Their panic seemed to have been greatly increased by the'ringing of the large bell on top of the school house by some unknown person. GREAT FIRE IN NEW YORK. On the morning of Nov. 25, shortly before 7 o'ctock fire was discovered in the street car stables ou Eight avenue, New York, and notwithstanding fort streams of water were turned upon the blazing buildings, it was only when there was nothing further for the ilnmes to feed upon, that the firemen ob­ tained the mastery. The stabies were in th' four story brick building fronting 900 feet on Eight avenue and 400 feet on Forty-ninth and Fiftieth streets. In the rear of the Ninth ave­ nue sitlo there was a wilderness of carpenter and wagon rels shops, and mountains of old bar­ ,many thousands stacked to a height of thirty or forty feet. They were saved by the efforts of the firemen, who from the beginning specially directed their attention to this point to prevent a general conflagration among the tenement houses on Ninth avenue. Almost before a movement to save the stock in the s'ables could be made, the flames burst simul­ taneously from the windows in Fiftieth and Forty-ninth streets sides, and it became clear that the building was doomed to destruction. The cars stored on the ground floor were run out and saved, while the horses stabled on the upoer floor were untied and ran down the in­ clined plane to the ground. There were' near iy 800 horses and the work of getting them out was one of great difficulty and danger. Blinded by the smoke and frightened by the flames they kicked and reared, and over 100 had to be abandoned to destruction. Their piteous whining could be heard above the roar of the flames. By falling walls four fire men were badly infured, two of whom fatally. Loss $260,000. The fire is supposed to have originated from spontaneous combnstion in damp hay. ENGLISH MARKETS. The Mark Lane Express says: Fortun ately wheat sowing made fair progress before the frost set in, and it will proceed faster 11 the weather ameliorates. However, in some districts it is feared future prospects arc jeop ardized oy the badness of the seed wheat, re­ ally good samples of which are exceedingly scarce. The operations in Scotland are more backward, but if the weather remains prop! tious for another fortnight a-fair area will be sown. The harvest is now completed in the latter districts of Scotland. But the results are very unsatisfactory. In England the home crop is arriving more freely at the country markets, but its condition continues unsatis factory. Provincial trade was dull. Wheat declined a shilling per quarter In many .im portant centres. In London, imports of for­ eign wheat were again unusually heavy, sup­ plies from Monday to Friday having been 87, 280 quarters. A large proportion of imports were from Russia, and these may yet be pro­ longed if the weather continues mild, as no definite news of the closing of the Baltic ports has been received. The futufe course of psi ces, however, depends on the action of Amer ica alone. The gigantic visible supply fetters trade. Of course, the large imports now ar­ riving are considerably in excess of the pres. ent requirements, but notwithstanding the surface fluctuation the outlook for holders is decidedly hopeful. The stoppage of Russian supplies may probably turn the scalo In the seller's favor. Very little business has been done during the week just paBt Wheat for ex­ port was pressed for sale to avoid landing ex­ penses. and declined about a shilling. Tho arrivals at ports of call have been moderate. There was a fair demand for wheat ofl coast, and a good many cargoes were sold both for the continent and tho united kingdom at im­ proving prices, the decline of the early part of the week being fully recovered. Maize was slightly lower but the demand somewhat im p-oved. There was very little business done in forwarding wheat, owing to the high prices asked in America. Resellers offered very spar. Ingly,but there have been some sales of red winter on passage at 53s@53s 9d, and at 66s for December and January. Shipments of, English wheat last week, 40,065 quarters, at 47s lOd per quarter, against 49,580 quarters, at 41s 2d the same week last year.

Cithern of the Senate and Home of Representatives The members of the Forty sixth Congress have assembled in the first reg­ ular session, under cironmstances calling tor mntnal congratulation and grateful acknowl­ edgment to the giver of all good, tot .the large and universal measure of national prosperity whioh we now enjoy. The most interesting events which have occurred in onr public af­ fairs since last annual message to'Congress are oonneeted with tho financial operations of the government directly affecting the basinets interests of the country. THE 

RESUMPTION AOT. I congratulate Congress on the successful ex­ ecution of the resumption aot at the time fixed and in the manner contemplated by law. The notes of the United States began to be re­ deemed in coin since the 1st of January last, and they have been promptly redeemed on pre­ sentation and in business, transactions, pnblic and private, in all parts of the country. They are reoeived and paid out as the equivalent of The demand upon the treasury for gold and silver in exobange for United States notes has been comparatively smaller and the voluntary deposits of coin and bullion in exchange for notes have been very large. The excess of prcoious metals deposited or ex­ changed for United States notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed,' is about $40,000,000. The resumption of specie payment has been followed by a very great re­ vival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world,, we are enabled to enter upon equal competi­ tion with other nations in trade andproduc-. tion. The increasing foreign demand for our manufactures and agricultural produots has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold from the 1st of July last to November 15 to the amount of about «9,000.000. WVUNDINO OPERATIONS. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. Bonds of the government bearing only fonr per cent, in­ terest have been sold at or above par sufficient in-amountto pay off all the national debt which was redeemable under the present laws. The amonnt of interest saved annnally by the process of refunding the debt since March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bmods sold were largely in small sums, and the dumber of our oitizens now holding "public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt which ma­ tures within less than two years is $792,121, 700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of five per cent, and the balance, is in bonds bearing 0 per cent, interest. It is be­ lieved that this part of the publio debt can be refnndedby the issue rf 4 per ct. bonds, and by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected, about $10,000,000 can be annually Baved to the treasury. To secure this import­ ant reduction of interest to be paid by the United States further legislation is required, which it is hoped will be provided by Congress during the present session. 

GOLD AND BILVKB COINAGE. The coinage of gold by the mints of theUnit. ed States during the last fiscal year was $400, 986,915. The coinage of silver dollars since the passage of the act for that purpose, report­ ed Nov. 1, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which $13,700,844 have been issued from the treasury and are now in circulation and $32,300,506 are still in the possession of the government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of ac­ tion before the United States and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect permanent system of equality of gold and Bilver in tho recognized money of the world, leads me to recommend tkat Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply during the coming year its own instructions which may well be awaited before attempting further ex­ perimental measures with the coinage. I would, however, strongly urge upon Congress the importance of authorizing the secretary of tbe treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars npoft the present legal ratio. The mar­ ket value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value ef the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation, it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of valne, and thus.defeat tbe desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver whioh shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world. BXTIBKMXNT or LEGAL TENDSBC. The retirement from circulation of United States notes' with the capacity of the legal ten­ der in private contracts is a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency, which should be accented as the policy of the government and the interest and security of the people of it. It is my firm conviction that the issue of legal tender money, money baaed wholly on the authority and credit of the government, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the constitution and a vio­ lation of sound finaneial principles. The issue of United States notes during the late civil war with the capacity of legal tender between private individuals was not authorized except as a means for rescuing the country from immi­ nent periL The circulation of these notes for paper money for any protracted period of time after the accomplishment of this purpose was not contemplated by tbe framera of the law under which they were issu&i. They an­ ticipate the redemption and withdrawal of the notes at the earliest practicable period consist­ ent with the attainment of the object for which they were provided.' The policy of the United States steadily adhered to from the adoption of the constitution has been to avoid the creation of a national debt, and when from necessity in time of war, debts have been cre­ ated, they havo been paid off on return of peace as rapidly as possible. With this view, and for this purpose, it is recommended that existing laws for the accumulation cf a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the pnblic debt within a limited period, be maintained. If any change of tbe objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress it is suggested, experience has shown, a duty can be placed on tea and coffee, which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars an­ nually to the treasury. MORMONISM. Tho continued deliberate violation, by a large number of proiaiaent and idfl'iential oitizens of the Territory of Utah, of the laws of tbe United States.for tha prosecution and punishment of polygamy, merits the attention of every de­ partment of the government. This Territory has a population sufficient to entitle it to ad­ mission as a State. This important-change will not, however, be approved by tbe conntry while the citizens of Utah, in very considera­ ble numbers, uphold a practice whioh ik con­ demned as a crime by the laws of all civilised communities throughout tbe world. The law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with unanimitybyCongress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained until recently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah because of the peculiar difficulties attending its en­ forcement. Tha opinion widely prevailed among citixens of Utah that the law was in contradiction of the constitutional guarantee of religions freedom. This objection is now removed. The supreme court of the United States hgs decided the law to be within the legislative power of Congress, binding as a rufc of aption for all who rosida within tbe Territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It should be firmly and ef­ fectually executed. If not sufficiently strin­ gent in the provisions, it should be amended, and in aid of the purposes'in view, 1 recom­ mend more comprehension and more searching methods for preventing as well as punishing tbjg crime, be provided. If necessary to secure obedieuse £o law, the enjoyment and exercise of the righta and privileges of citizenship in the Territories of tbe United States may be withheld or withdrawn from'those who violate or oppose the enforcement of law on this sub­ ject. PHOTXCTION or THE BALLOT. The el&tions of the past year, though occu­ pied only with State ojOSoes, have not failed to elicit in political dissuasions which attended them all over the country new an4 d«c»%ive evi­ dence of (he deep interest which the great body of citigen* t*ke in the progress of the country towards more general and complete establish­ ment, at whatever oost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topics of political con­ cern demand great attention from our people, both in tho sphere of national and State au­ thority, I find ho reason to qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative interests of the government, however urgent or weighty, will ever displaoe the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of citizenship, and that public opinion will override prejudices, and -that and. State attachment jn demanding that.yU'tyy our .wide territory the name#!*? character of e^tyenof the United States shall mean onfi and the saoj thing and carry with tberiT unchallenged security and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelligence and -patriotism of all good citizens, ot every part of the ooqntry. however much they may be divided in opinion on other political sub­ lets, to unite in aompdling obedience to exist­ ing laws aimed at'' the protection of of shffiage. I respectfully. to anpplyany defecta in eypfrieptta haa shown and mi theaelawn wt which it i» Within nsatpnrpsai, ^tmpbwef'p) jpmedy. I a 06-opexaiion of the •mtqiestfsaM **aele will f— jpwitpatfc* ofj service of the government, and expressed an intention, transmitting to Congress aa early as practicable, a report upon this subject by tbe chairman of the civil fOrvice commission. In view of the fact, during a con»ider«ble period, the government of Great Britain has been deal iiig with the administative problems and abuses in various particulars analogous to those presented in this country, and that recent years the measures adopted were under­ stood to have been effeotive and in every re­ spect highly satisfactory, I thought desirable to have fuller information upon the snbjeot. and aooordingly requested tbe obairman of the oivil service commission to make A thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an elaborate and comprehensive report. The report sets forth tbe history of the parti­ san spoil system in Great Britain,and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary patropageand of official interference with the freedom of elections,- shows that after long trials of various kinds of examinations, those whioh are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on under the superin­ tendence of a single commission, have with great advantage been established as the con­ dition of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The com­ pletion of the report, owisg to the extent of the labor involved in its preparation, and the omission of Congress to make any' provision either for the compensation or-the expenses of the commission, has been postponed until the present time. It is herewith transmitted to Congress. While the reform measures of an­ other government are of no authority to us, they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our constitution and social life may com­ mend them to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concerning the de­ fects and abuses in our civil administration, remain unchanged except in so far as an en­ larged experience has deepened my sense of the duty, both of officers and of the people themselves, to co-operate for their removal. The grave evils and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to office, and of the of* fice tenure, are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of the great parties, in reports of departments, in tbe debates and proceed­ ings of Congress, the messages of executives, the gravity if the evils haR been admitted. To command the necessary support every measure of reform most be based on common right and justice, and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties whioh are inevitable and essential in a free State. When people have approved a policy at a national election, confidence in the officers they have selected and the advisers who, in accord­ ance with our political institutions should be consulted as to the policies which it is their duty to carry into effect, is unquestionable. It is eminently proper they should explain to the people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the performance of their official duties. It hardly need be pointed out that very different con­ siderations apply to the greater number of those who fill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their public service consists in the discharge of their functions irrespective of par­ tisan politics. Their duties are the same whatever party is in power, and what­ ever policy prevails. As a consequence, it follows that their terms of offioo should not depend upon the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any party, but should be de­ termined by their capacity to serve the people most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan interests. The same considerations that should govern the tenure, should also prevail in the appointment, discipline and rsmovol of those subordinate. The authority of appointment and removal is not a perquisite which may be Used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but a trust to be oxercised in tho publio inter­ est. The only just ground of discrimination is the measure of character and capacity he has to make that service most useful to the peo­ ple, except in cases when upon just and recog­ nized principles, it is upon the theory of pen­ sions, offices and promotion are bestowed as rewards for past services. Their bestowal up­ on any theory which ..disregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breech of that trust subject to which tbe ap­ pointing power is held. In the light of these principles, it becomes of great importance to provide just and ade­ quate means, especially for every department, or a large administrative office where personal discrimination on the part of the head is not practicable for ascertaining those qualifications to" which appointments and removals should have reference. To fail to provide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of ascer­ taining facts upon which the most righteous claims to office depend, but of ncressity to discourage all worthy aspirants by handing over appointments and removals to mere influence and favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment, and the interest of the people to bestow it upon him, it would seem clear that a wise and just method of ascertain­ ing personal fitness for office must needs be an important and paramount function of every wise and iust government. It has long since become impossible in the great offices for those having the duty of nom­ ination and appointment to personally enquire into tbe individual qualifications of more than a small proportion of those seeking offic a with the enlargement of the civil service, that proportion must continue to become less. In the earlier years of the government the subor­ dinate offices were so few in number that it was quite easy for those making appointments and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of the candidates. Party managers of methods had not then become powerful agen­ cies of coercion, hostile to the free and just exercise of the aDnointing power. A large and responsible par Af the duty of restoring the civil service to the desired purity and efficiency rests on the President, and it has been my purpose to do what is in my power to advance such prudent and gradual measures of reform as will most surely bring about the rad­ ical change of system essential to make our ad­ ministrative methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of au­ thority it is in the power of the executive to do much to promote suoh a reform, and it cannot be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without cooperation on the part of Congress, and a considerate and intelligent sup­ port among the people. Befornfk which cha'lenge tbe generally accepted theories of parties, and demand changes in methods of departments, are not tbe work of a day. Their permanent foundations must be laid in sound principles and in ah experience which demon­ strates their wisdom, and exposes the errors of their adversaries. Every woi thy Officer desires to make his official aotion a gain and honor to his country, but the people themselves, far more than their officers in publio station, are interested in a pure, economical and vigorous administration. By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and now in substance incorporated in the revised stat­ utes, the practice of arbitrary appointmeats to the subordinate grades in the departments was condemned, and examinations as to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of ex­ aminers, were provided for and made condi­ tions of admission to the public service. These statutes ajre a decision by Congress that exam­ inations of Bome sprt as to attainments and capacity, are essential to the wel! being of the public service. The important questions since the cnactmeut of these laws have been as to the character of these examinations, and whether official favor and partisan influence, or common right and merit, were to control ac­ cess to the examinations in practice, ^hesp examinations have not always been open to worthy persons generally, who might wish to be examined, Official favoritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear tp have designated those who alone were permitted to go before the examining board, subjecting even the examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates very difficult to resist. As a oonsequence the standard Of ad mission fell below that which the publio inter­ est demanded. It was also almost inevitable that a system which provides for various boards of examiners with no common supervision or uniform measure of procedure should result in confusion and inadequate teats of capacity highly detrimental to the public interests, further and more radical chango was obviously required. }n the annual ipesBsge of December, 1870, my predecessor declared that "there is no duty which so embarrasses the executive and heads of departments as that of appointments, por is there any Bueh arduous and thankless labors imposed on Senators and Representatives as finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men and often does not tit men for public places. The eleva­ tion and purification of the civil service of the government will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States." Congress accordingly passed* tbe act ap­ proved March 3,1871, to regulate the civil ser­ vice of the United States and promote the ef­ ficiency thereof, giving the necessary authori ity to the executiye to inaugurate a civil ser vice reform. Acting under the statute, whioh was interpreted as intending to secure a systejn r/« pose, who eptpred executive J" of States', in this convinced thai if kftfpst qn'the para nfM«no serious we oomptete retard the gen* theattentkxr at tha carH wityi rial qpon the discharge' of the daties |ae pared, with an intelligent appreciation of the requirements pl the service and regulation?, and who, in their edacity aa a board, haps been known as the pivilser/ute commissippers. Congress for two years appropriated the money needed for the compensation and if* the expense of carrying on the .. work of the commission. It appeara from the n-~ port of the commission submi\ted to-the Presi­ dent in April, 1874, that eramtnationa had been held in various sections of the ooantry, and that an appropriation of about $25,00(1 would be required to meet the annual ex­ penses, including tbe salaries involved, The report was transmitted to Congress by special message on April 18,1874,. with, this ^following f«vonble comment upoirtne labors of the b&h* mission Sus tained by Oongreaa, I have nodonbitthe rnlsa' *fter the experience gained, be so improved and e&for$ed W to'sttll more materially benefit the public, seryioeaad relieve tbe executive, members of-Cang the beads of departmentS frolh influen udicial to good administration^ The I slss. as they have hitherto been enforced, have- result­ ed beneficially as is shown by the" opinions' of the members of the'cSbindt-and-ibetr sabcttdf nates |n the departmenta, and in that opinion I concur.'.''' in the funny! tho same year aimtti andan appropriation of tbe oojftmisajag priation waa not theg*ti*e wprk of thai leafing *he qualifications to be tested in any systematic manner, or of semiring lor tbe public service the advantages of competition upon any ex­ tensive plsn. I recommended in my annual message of Deoember,1877, the making Of an appropria­ tion for the resumption- -of the work of the commission. In -the meantime,' however, competitive examinations nhder man? embarrassments, have been ebndbeted within limited apheres' in the executive da partments in Waahington and in a number -of the custom houses and postofficea of the prin­ cipal cities of the conntry, with a view to fur­ ther test their effects, and in every instanoe have been found to be-as'salutary as tbey are stated to be nnder the administration of my predecessor. I think the economy, purity and efficiency of the public service would bo greatly promotfa by their systematic intro­ duction, wherever practicable throughout the entire civil service of -the .government, togeth­ er with ample provision for their general supervision, in oraer tdieottte consistency ahd uniform iustice. Beports from the secretary of the interior, from the postmaster general, from t^e post­ master in the city of ^ew York, .'where such examinations have been for some time ott trial, and also from the collector of the port, the nar val officers and the surveyor in that city,., and from the postmasters and collectors in several of the other large cities, sh JW that the competi­ tive system, where applied,- has in, various ways contributed to improve the public service. The repbrts show that the results have been salutary in a. marked degree, and that a general application of similar rules cannot fail. to. be a decided benefit to the service. The reports of the gov­ ernment officers in the city of New York es­ pecially, bear decided testimony to the .ntility of open competitive examination in their re­ spective! offices, showing that these etamin'a tions and the excellent qualfications of those submitted to the service through them have bad a marked effect. upon tbe persons previ­ ously in the service, and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has been on the part of the latter au increased interest "in the work and a desire to extend acquaintance with it beyond the par­ ticular desk occupied, and thus the morale of the entire force has been raised. The examina­ tion have been attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investi­ gate the scope and character of the tests, and the method of determining .-the results, and those visitors have Without exception approved the methods employed,- and several of them have publicly attested their favorable opinion. Upon such consideration I deem it my duty to renew the recommendation contained in my annual messsge December, 1877, requesting Congress to make the heoessary appropria­ tions for the resumption 'of the work of the civil service commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a moderate compen­ sation to persons in -the publio service who may perform extra labor upon or 'under the commission, as the executive may direct. I am convinced that if a just 'and adequate test of merit iB enforced for admission to the pub­ lio service in making promotions, such abuses as removals without good cause, and partisan and official interference with the proper exer­ cises of the appointing power, will in a large measnre disappear. There aie other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan ap­ pointments and the constant peril of removal without cause, very naturally lead to an ab­ sorbing and mischevious political activity on the part of those thus appointed, which net only interferes with the due discharge of offioial duty, nut is incompatible with the freedom of elections. Not without warrant in the views of several of my predesessors in the Presidential office, and directly within the law of 1871 al­ ready cited, I endeavored by regulation made on the 22d day of June, 1877, to put some rea­ sonable limits to such abuses. It. may not be easy and it may never, per­ haps, be necessary to define with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of federal officers, but while their right to |hold and freely express their opinions can not be questioned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the proper discharge of their official duties, nor to use the authority of their office to enforce their own opinions or to coerce the political action of those who hold different opinions. Beasons of justice and publio policy, quite analagous to those which forbid the use of official power for the oppres­ sion of the private citizen, impose upon the government the duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbitrary exactions.1 In whatever aspect considered, the practice of making levies for party purposes upon the salaries of officers, is highly demoralizing to the pnblic service and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as any other, citizen from using his own money in aid of his opinion or his party, he should aUv be as free as any other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for time and labor of the officers it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in or­ der that tbey may beara tax, the excess is in­ direct robbery of the public funds. I reccommend therefore such a revision and extension of the present statutes as shall se­ cure to those in every grade of official life or public employment, tbe protection with which a great and enlightened nation should guard those who are faithful in its service. 

FOREIGN BELATIONS. Our relations with foreign counries have con­ tinued peaceful. With Great Britain there are still unsettled questions growing out of the laws of the maritime provinces, and the action of provincial authorities, deemed to be in dero­ gation of rights secured by treaty to American fishermen, the United States minister in Lon don has been instructed to present a demand for $10,530,502 in view of damages received by American citizens at Fortune Bay on the 6th day of January, 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the British government and an early reply is ticipated. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary examinations the sub­ ject of our participation in the provincial fish­ eries as regulated by treaty will at once be brought to tbe attention of the British gov­ ernment with a view to an early and permanent settlement of the whole question, which was only temporarily adjusted by the treaty of Washington. Efforts have been made to obtain the remov­ al, of restrictions found injurious to the ex­ portation of cattle to the United Kingdom. Bome correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and property upon the. lakes, which has resulted in important modifications of the previous regu lation of the dominion government on this sub? ject in the interest of humanity and commerce. In accordance with the joint resolution of the last session of Congress, commissioners were appointed to represent the United States at the two international exhibitions in Aus­ tralia, one of which is now in progress at Syd­ ney and the other to be held next year in Mel­ bourne, a desire has been expressed by mer­ chants and manufacturers interested^ the im­ portant and growing trade with Australia, that an increased provision should be made by Con­ gress for the represeetation of our industries at the Melbourne exhibition of next year, and the subject in respectfully submitted to your favorable consideration. The assent of the government has been given to the landing on tbe coast of Massacbvsetts of a new and independent trans-Atlantic cable between France, by way of the French island St. Pierre, and this country, subject to any fu­ ture legislation of Congress on the subject. The condition imposed' before allowing con­ nection with our shores to be' established, are suph as secure its competition with apy exist­ ing or future lin.es of manne cable, and preclude amalgamation therewith, and provide fpr an entire equality of rights tp our government and people with those of France in the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege as accorded by France to tbe disadvantage of any future cable communication between France and the United States which may be projected and apcom? plished by our citisens. An important reduction of the present rates on cable communication with Europe, which is felt to be too burdensome to tbe interests of onr commerce, must necessarily flow from tbe establishment of this competing line. Tbe attention of Congress waa drawn to the propriety of some general regulation of Congress of the whole subject of transmarine cables by my predecessor, in his -message of December 7, 1875, and I.respectfully submit to yotir consideration tho importance of Con­ gressional action in this matter. The questions 'of 'grave*importance with 8pain grpwipg, opt of the incidents of the Cuban insurrection, have beep, for the most part, happily and honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the commission now sitting in Washington for the decision of private cases in this connection, will soon be able to bring its labors to'a conclusion. The long standing question of East Florida claims has lately been renewed as a subject of correspondence and may' possibly require Con­ gressional aotion for its final disposition. A treaty with the Netherlands with respect to oonsular rights and privileges similar to -those with other powers, has been signed and ratted, and t^e ratifications were exchanged op the Slst of July liut. Negotiations for ex­ tradition treaties with the Ne^ierlan^s and with •"kare n.95* pending. $om«i questions r*i satisfactory basjs red with fespept by $viss t^unipi] question'has also occur tor an 'fssertpd laim authorities to exercise tutelage ovpr persons and property of Swiss pit isena, naturalised in this country. Jt ble this may require adjustment^hy t|¥ the .(Herman empire. Frequent questions arise in oonnection with tbe snbjeot of naturalisa­ tion and expatriation but the imperial govern­ ment has constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty stipulations in regard to them. In oonsequence of the Omission of Congress to provide for a diplomatic representative at AUtem, the. legation to TlreeCe has been with­ drawn. There ia now no channel of diplomatic cbAtfaunication between the two countries and tbe'expediency of providing for one in some form is submitted to Congress. The relations wiUi Austria, Kussia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, anVBelgium continue amicable and marked by no incident of craecial importanoe* A 'change of the personal bead of the government of Egypt has taken plaqe.

BELATIONS WITH MEXICO. It is a gratification to be able to announce that ^brongb tbe judicious and energetic action Of the military commanders of the two nations On each side of the Bio Grande, nnder the in­ structions of 'their respective governments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, and in the localities where formerly most de­ structive have now almost wholly ceased. In view uf this result, I entertain a confident ex­ pectation that the continuance of this preva­ lence of quiet ou the border will soon become so assured as to justify a modification of the presep orders to our military commanders as1 to crossing the border, without encouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of the two countries. The third installment of the award against Mexico, under the claims commission of July 4, 1868, was dnly paid, and has been put in the course of distribution in pursuance of the act of Congress providing for the same. The sat­ isfactory situation between tbe two oonntries leads me to anticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico and an increased contribu­ tion of capital and industry by our people to the development of the great resources of that country. I earnestly commend to the wisdom ot Congress the provision of suitable legisla­ tion looking to this'result.. REPUBLIC OF COLUMBIA. Diplomatic intercjurse with Columbia is again fully restored by the arrival of a minister from that country to the United States. This is especially fortunate in view of the fact that tbe question of an inter-oceanic canal has re jently assumed anew and important aspect and is now under discussionwith the Central Amer­ ican countries, through whose territory the caual, by the Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is trusted that enlightened states­ manship on their part will see that the early prosecution of such a work will largely enure to the benefit not only of their own citizens and those of the United States, but of the com­ merce of the civilized world. It ia not doubted that should the work be undertaken under tbe protective auspices of the United States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the right of way and security by the Central American government, the capital for its completion would be readily furnished from this country and Europe, which might, suoh guarantees failing, prove inaccessible. SOUTH AUEBICA Diplomatic relations with Chili have also been strengthened by the reception of a minis­ ter from that country. The war between Peru, Bolivia and Chili still continnes. The United 8tates have not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter farther than to convey to all the governments concerned the evidence that the friendly offices of the government of tbe United States for tbe restoration of peace upon an hon­ orable basis will be extended in case the bellig­ erents shall exhibit a readiness to accept tbem. Cordial relations c-mtinue with Brazil and the Argentine republic, and trade with those countries is improving. A provision for regu­ lar and more frequent mail communication in our own ships between the ports of this country and the nations of South America seems to me to deserve the attention of Congress as an essen­ tial precursor of an enlargement of our com­ merce with them, and an extension of our car­ rying trade. A recent revolution in Venezuela has been followed by the establishment of a provisional government. This government bas not yet been formally recognized, and it is deemed de­ sirable to await the proposed action of the people, which is expected to give it the sanc­ tion of constitutional forms. A naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan slandg to make surveys and take possession Btation is There is a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all European and American countries, and it is believed that by judicious aotion in re­ gard to its development it oan and will be still more enhanced, and that American products and. manufactures will find new and expanding markets. The reports of diplomatic and con­ sular officers upon this subject under the sys­ tem now adopted have resulted in obtaining much valuable information which has been and will continue to be laid before Congress and the pnblio from time to time. ALASKA. The third article of the treaty with Bnssia of March 30, 1867, by which Alaska was ceded to the United States, provides that the inhabi­ tants of the ceded territory, with the exception of uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to tbe enjoyment of all rights of citizens of the United States, and shall be maintained and protected ip the free enjoy a: ent of their lib­ erty, prosperity and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such laws and regulations as the United States m*y from time to time adopt. In regard to the aboriginal tribes of that country, both the obligations of the treaty and tbe necessities of tbe people demand that some organized form of government over the territory of Alaska be adopted. There appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged with common law offenses, such as assault, robbery and murder, and no magistrate author­ ized to issue «r execute process in such cases. Serious difficulties havo already arisen from offenses of this oharaoter, not only among the original inhabitants but among citizens of the United States and other countries who have engaged in mining, fishing and other business operations within the terri­ tory. A bill authorizing the appointment of justices of the pe%pe and constables, and the arrest and detection of persons charged with criminal offenses and pioviding for an apeal to United States courts for the district of Oregon on suitable cases will at tbe proper time be sub­ mitted to Congress. THE TREASURY Tho attention of Congress is called to tbe annual report of the secretary of the treasury on tbe condition of the pnblic finances, fhe ordinary revenues from all Sources for the fiscal year end­ ing June ^0, 1879 were...... .$273,827,184 46 The ordinary expenditures for the same period were 266,947,883 53 Leaving a surplus revenue for the year of 6,879,300 93 The receipts for the present fiscal year ending June 30,1980, actual and estimated, are as fol lowsf Actual receipts for first quarter oommenoing July. 1879 70,843,663 61 Estimated receipts for remain­ ing three quarters of- the year 208,156,334 39 Total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and esti­ mated 288,000,000 00 Tbe expenditures for the same peri-id will .be, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual expendi­ tures..., $ 91,683,385 10 For the remaining three quar­ ters of the year the expendi­ ture areesfimated at 172,316,614 90 Malcipg the total expenditufes. 204,000,000 00 Leaving an estimated surplus of revenue for the' year end­ ing June 30,1889, of.

T$B WAB DE£ABTiqraT The secretary of war reports that the war de­ partment estimates for the fiscal year ending June 80, 1881, are $40,380,428.89, the same being for a less sum of monqr than any annual estimate tendered to Congress from that de­ partment during period of at least twelve years. He4 concurs with the general of the army in recommending sncb legislation aa will authorize the establishment of the full number of 25,000 men for the line of tbe army, exclu­ sive of 3,463 men required for detached duties, and therefore not available tor service in the field. He also recommends that Congress be asked to .provide by law for the disposition of a large .number of abandoned military posts and reservations, which, though very valuable in •themselves, have been rendered useless for military purposes by the advance of cirili zatir-n and settlement. He unite* with tbe quartermaster general in recommending that appropriations be made for the construction of a ebeap and .perfeoUy fire- pfoftf building for the safe stocsge of a vast amrtsafot mefbey abodahts, votcbers, claims 'aed oiber valaable-zeports now in ther auarter paerafs office and exposed to great totf^destrneUonbyfre. nleo yimonpscis^ incyifog^ »jth the t» statute of convictions as applied to the crime of desertion. In these several recommendations I ooncur. Tbe seoretary of war further reports tfi&t the work tor the improvement of tbe south pass of the Mississippi river, under contract with Mr. James B. Eads, made in pursuance of an act of Congress, has been prosecuted during the past year with a greater measure of sncoess in the attainment of the results than during any previous years. The channel throngh the South Pass, which at the begin­ ning of operations in June, 1875, had a depth of only seven and one-half feet of water, had, on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of twenty-six feet, having a width of not less than 200 feet and a central depth of thirty feet. Payments have been made in accordance with the contract, as the wotk has progressed, amounting in the aggregate to $4,260,000, and further payments will-become due as provided by the statutes, in event of success in main-' taining the channel now secured. The reports of the general of the army and his subordinates present a full detailed ac­ count of tbe military operations for the sup­ pression of hostilities, and praises are justly awarded tbe officers and troops engaged, for the promptitude, skill and courage displayed. The past year bas been one of almost un­ broken peace and quiet on tbe Mexican fron­ tier, ana there is reason to believe the efforts of this government and of Mexico to maintain order in that region will prove permanently anccessful. The department was enabled during the past year to find temporary thongh crowded ac­ commodation and safe depository for a portion of its records in the completed cast wing of the bnilding, designed for tho Btate, war and navy departments. The construction of the north wing of the bnilding, the part of the structure intended for nse of the war depart­ ment, is being carried forward with all pos­ sible dispatch, and tbe work should receivc from Congress such liberal appropriations aa will secure its speedy completion. THE 

NAVT. The report of the secretary of the navy shows continued improvement in that branch of the service. During tho last fiscal year extensive repairs have been made on vessels and two new ships have been completed and made ready for sea. The total expenditures,ended June30,1879, including specific appropriations not esti­ mated for by tho department, were $1,353, 571.09. The expenses chargeable to the year, after deducting the amount ot the specific ap­ propriation, were $13,343,317.79. But this is subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year. The amount of appropriations applied to the last fiscal year was $14,538,646.17. There was therefore a bal­ ance of $1,479,054.37 remaining unexpended and to the credit of tbe d. partment on June 30. 1879. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30,1881, are $14,864,147.93, which exceeds the appropriations for the present fiscal year $301, 897.28. The reason for this increase is ex­ plained in the secretary's report. The appro­ priations available for tbe present fiscal year are $14,502,250.67, which will, injlht opinion of tbe secretary, answer all tbe ordinary demands of the service. The amount drawn from the treasury from July 1st to Nov. 14, 1879, was $5,770,404.12, of which $1,095,440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditures for that period $4,674,963.79. IE the expenditures of the Remaining two-thirds of tbe year do not exceed the proportion for these four months, thf re will remain unexpended at the end of the year $477,359.30 of current appropriations. The report of tbe secretary shows the gratifying fact that among all the disbursing officers of the pay corps of the navy, there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with him in recom­ mending the removal of tbe Observatory to a more healthful location. That institution re­ flects credit upon the nation and bas obtained the approbation of scientific men in all parts of the world. Its removal from its present lo­ cation would not only be conducive to tbe health of its officers and professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The appropriation for judicial expenses which has heretofore been made for the department of justice in gross was subdivided at tbe iast ses­ sion of Congress, and no appropriation what ever was made for tbe payment of the fees of marshals and their deputies, either in the ser­ vice of process or for the-discharge of other du­ ties, and since June 30 these officers have con­ tinued the performance of their duties without compensation from tbe government, taking upon themselves the necessary incidental out­ lays, as well as rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable instances has the proper execution of process of the United States failed by reason of the absence of the requisite appropriations. This couise of official conduct on the part of these officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the at­ torney general, who informed tbem, howv ever, that they would necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon the proR pect of future legislation by Congress. I therefore especially i-ecommend that an imme­ diate appropriation be made by Congress for this purpose. of the privileges ceded to the United States by Samoa in the harbor of Pago Pago. A coaling to be established there which will be convenient and nseful to tho United States vessels. BOUSIANIA AND BEE VIA. The subjeot of opening diplomatic relations with Boumania and Servia, now become inde­ pendent sovereignties, is at present nnder consideration and is a subject of diplomatic correspondence. VOBEIGN TBADE. Tbe act making tbe principal appropriation fi-r the department of justice at previous ses­ sions has uniformly contained the following clause: "And for defraying tbe expenses which may be incurred in the enforcement of the act approved Feb. 28, 1870, entitled an act to amend an act approved May 30, 1870, entitled an act to enforce the right of citizens in the United States to vote in the several States of the United States, and for other purposes, or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto." No appropriation was made for this purpose for tbe current year. As no general election for members of Congress occurred, the omission was a matter of little practical importance. 8udb elections will, however, take plape during the ensuing year, and the appropriation for the pay of marshals and deputies should be suffi­ cient to embrace compensation for the services they may be required to perform at such elec­ tions. THE SUPREME COURT. The business of the supreme court is at pres­ ent largely in arrears. It cannot be expected that more cases can be decided than are now dispose.! ef in the annuai session, or that by any assiduity the distinguished magistrates who compose the court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits the business has inpreased to such an extent that the delay of justice will call the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed all is done in each circuit wbiph can be fairly expected, and the evils arising from delay are less heayily felt by the United States than by private suitors, as its causes are ad­ vanced by the court when it is seen that they involve the 4iscussi of questions pf a public character, The remedy suggested by the attorney gen eral is the appointment of additional ciicuit jndgesand tbe creation of an intermediate court of errors and appeals, which shall relieve the supreme court of apart of its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance of circuit duties. I recommend this suggestion to the consideration of Con­ gress. It would seem to afford a complete remedy and would involve, if ten additional circuit judges are appointed, an .expenditure at tbe present rate of salaries of not more than $60,000 a year, whioh would certainly be small in comparison with the objscts to be attained THE 

INDIANS. The reports'of the secretary of the interior and of the commissioner of Indian affairs, set­ ting forth the present state of our relations with the Indian tribes and onr territory, the measures taken to advance their civilization and prosperity, and the progress already achieved by them, will be found pf more than ordinary, interest. The general conduct of our Indian population has been so satisfactory that the occurrence of two disturbances which resulted in bloodshed and destruction of prop­ erty, is all the more to be lamented. The history of the outbreak on the White BiverUte reservation, Western Colorado, has become so familiar by elaborate report in tbe pnblio press, that its remarkable incidents need not be stated here in detail. It is ex­ pected that tbe settlement of this difficulty will lead to such arrangements as will prevent further hostile conflicts between tbe .Indisns and the border settlements in Western Col­ orado. Tbe other disturbances occurred at the Mes celaro Agency in New Mexico, where Nieland, the head of a small band of marauders, after committing many atrocities, being vigorously charged by a military force made bis way across the Mexican border and is nov on a for­ eign soil. While these occurrences, in which compara­ tively small numbers of Indiana were engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority of onr In­ dian population have fully justified the expec­ tation of those who believe that by humane and peaceful influences, the Indians can be led to abandon the habits of savage life, and to develop a capacity for nseful and civilized occupations. What they have already accomplished is shown in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work. The remarkable success which has at­ tended the experiment of employing as freight­ ers a class of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest and most intractable, and the gen. eral and urgent desire expressed by'them for the education of their children, may be taken aa sufficient proof that they will'be found ca­ pable of accomplishing much more'if tbey con­ tinue to be wisely and fairly guided. The Indian policy, sketched in the report of the secretary of the interior, the object of which ia to make liberal provisions for tbe education of Indian youths, to settle the In­ diana upon farm lots in severalty, and to give them title injfee on their farms inalienable for a certain number of years, and when their wants are thus provided, to dispose of by sale of lands on their reservations, not oocuwed and used by'them, a fund to be formed out of the prooeeds for the benefit of tbe Indians, which will gradually relieve tbe government of the expenses now provided for by annual appropriations, must commend itself as Inst and beneficial to the Indians and is calculated to remove those obstructions whioh the exist­ ence of large reservations presents to the set­ tlement and development of* the conntry. I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enabling the government to give Indi ansjt title in fee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to. them by allotment. 1 also repeat tbe recommendation in my first annual message that a law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proofs by their own labor ot supporting their families for a iramber of years, mid who are wilifog to taeh themselvea from their tribdf relations, to the heufit of tbe homestead act, and to granS them patenta containing tbe SUM provisional lalMsafcpityfor a oertain period. lfcr£teifl!Siit of sending a number of In­ dian children of both sexes to the Hampton plished with the very limited means heretofore normal and agricultural institute, in Virginia, J— to receive an elemementary English education and practical instruction in farinitig and other industries, has led to results so prbmiiiihg that it waa thought expedient to torn over the cav tJry_ barracks.at Ctrlialc, in Pennsylvania, to the interior department for' the establishment ef an Indian school on a larger seale. This school has now 158 pupils, selected from various tribes and in full operation. Arrangements are also made for the education.of number of Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on the Pacific slope in a similar manner at Forest drove in Oregon.' These institutions will commend themselves to the liberality of Congress-and to the philanthrppic munificence of the American people. Last spring information was received of the organisation of an extensive movement in the Western States, the object of which was the occupation by unauthorised persons of oertain lands in the Indian conntry ceded by the Chero kees to tbe government for the pnrpose of set­ tlement by other Indian tribes. On the 99th of April I issued a proclamation warning all persons against participation in such an at­ tempt and by tbe co-operation of a military force the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect tbe rights of the In­ dian inhabitants of that Territory to the full extent of theuexecutive, bnt it wonld be un­ wise to ignore the fact that a Territory so large, and with a population so sparce, and so great a wealth cf unused resources, will be found more exposed to tbe repetition of such attempts as happened this year, when the surrounding States are more densely settled, and the westward movement of our population look still more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under such circum­ stances the difficulty of maintaining the In­ dian territory in its present state will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to prepare for such a contin­ gency. I therefore fully approve of the advice given to them by the secretary of the inteiior on a recent occasion to divide among them­ selves in severalty as large a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire individual title in fee instead of the present tribal ownership in common, and consider in what-manner the balance of their lands may be disposed of by the government for their benefit. By adopting such a policy they would more certainly secure themselves in the valne of their possessions and at the same time pro­ mote progress in civilization and prosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate tbe present stats of things in the Territory. Tbe question whether a change in the control of tbe Indian service should be made was in the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint committee of both Houses for inquiry and re­ port. In my last annual message I expresbed the hope that a decision of that question, then in prospect, would arrest fnrtber agitation of! this subject, such agitation being apt to pro­ duce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as tbe Indians themselves. Since then, the committee having reported, the questions have been decided tbe negative by a vote in the House of Bepresentatives. For the reason here stated and in view of the faet of further uncertainty on this point, will be calculated to obstruct other much needed legislation, to weaken tbe discipline of the service and to unsettle salu­ tary measures now in progress for the govern­ ment and improvement of the Iudians,I respect­ fully recommend that the decision arrived at by Congress at its last eession be permitted to stand. 

TIMBER THEFTS. The efforts made by tbe department of tbe interior to arrest the depredations on the tim­ ber lands of the United States have been con tinned and have met with considerable sncccss. A large number of cases of trespass have been prosecuted in the conrts of the United States. Others have been settled, the trespassers offer­ ing to make payment to tbe government for the value of timber taken by them. The pro­ ceeds of prosecution and settlements, being turned into the treasury, ll exceed the amount of the sums appropriated by Congress for the purpose. A more im­ portant result, however, consists in the fact that the destruction of our publio forests by depredation, although such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in extent, and it is possible, if tbe present policy is vigorously pursue^ and sufficient provision to that end made by Congress,such trespasses, at least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed except in the Territories where timber for the daily requirements of tbe population cannot nnder the present state of the law be easily ob­ tained. I therefore earnestly invite the atten­ tion of Congress to the recommendation made by the secretary of the interior that a law be enaoted enabling the government to sell tim­ ber from tbe pnblio lands withont conveying tbe fee, where such lands are principally valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to conform to domestio wants and business requirements, while at the same time guarding against a sweeping reduction of the forests. The enact­ ment of such a law seemB to become a more pressing necessity every day. EDUCATION It is gratifying to learn from the bnrean of education the extent to whioh educational privileges throughout the Uhited States have been advanced during tbe year. No more fun­ damental responsibility rests in Congress than that of devising appropriate measures of finan­ cial aid to education, npplemental to local action, in the States and Territories, and in the District of Columbia. The wise fore­ thought of the founders of our government has not only furnished the basis for tbe support of the common school systems of tha newer States, but laid the foun­ dations for tbe maintenance of their universi­ ties, and of colleges of agriculture and me­ chanic art. Measures in accordance with this traditional policy for the further benefit of all these interests and the extension of some ad­ vantages to every portion of the country it is hoped will receive your favorable considera­ ble. WASHINGTON MONUMENT. The joint commission, created by the act of Congress of August 2nd, 1876, for the purpose of supervising and directing the completion of the Washington national monument, of which commission the President is a member, has giyen careful attention to this subject, and al­ ready the strengthening of the foundation has BO far progressed as to insure the entire success c-f this part of the work. A massive layer of ma-aonry has been introduced below the original foundation, Widening the base and increasing the stability of tbe structure, rendering it poasiblo to carry the shaft to completion. It is earnestly rec­ ommended that such further appropriation be maae for tbe oontinued prosecution of the work as may be necessary for the completion of this national monument at an early day. THE P06TOFFICE. The report of the postmaster general beare testimony to tbe general revival in business throughout the country. Tbe receipts of the postoffine department for tbe fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, was $30,011,982.86, being $764,465.91 more than in the preceding year, and $2,387,559.23 more than in 1877. The ex­ penditures of the department were $33,149, 899.45, of which the sum of $376,461.63 was paid on liabilities incurred in preceeding years. Tbo expenditures during the year were $801, 209.77 less than in the preceding year. This reduction is to be attributed mainly to the ope­ ration of the law passed on June 17, 1877, changing. the compensation of postmasters from a commission on the valu9 of stamps sold, to a commission on the stamps cancelled. The amonnt drawn from the treasury on ap­ propriations, in addition to the revenues of the department, was $303,454.96, being $2, 276,197,86 less than in the precpeding year. The expenditures of the fiscal year ending Jtraef 1881, are estimated at $39,920,900, and the receipts from all sources at $32,210, 000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for out of the treasury of $7,710,^00, The relations of tbe department with tbe railroad companies have been harmonized, notwithstanding tbe general reduction by Congress of their compensation by the appro­ priation for general facilities, and the railway postoffice lines have been greatly extended, es­ pecially in the Southern States. The interests of the railway mail service wonld be greatly promoted and tbe expendi­ tures cou'd be readily controlled by the classi­ fication of the employes of the railway mail, as recommended by the postmaster general. "The appropriations for services with respect to which the maximum limit is already fixed by law to be made in gross. The postmaster general recommends an amendment to the law regulating an increase of compensation for increased service and in­ creased speed on Star routes so as to enable him to advertise for proposals for snch in­ creased service and speed. He also suggests the advantages to accrue to the commerce of the country from the enact­ ment of a general law authorizing contracts with American built pteamers carrying tbe American flag for transporting the mail be­ tween the United States and ports of tbe West Indies and South America at a fixed maximum per mile, the amount to be expended being eqnalated by annnal appropriations in like manner with the amount for the domestio Star service. The arrangements msde by the postmaster general and the secretary of the treasury foi tbe collection of duties upon books received in the mail from foreign countries bas proved so satisfketory in its practical opera­ tion that the recommendation now made that Congress now extend the provisions of the set of March 8, 1879, nnder whic^i this arrange­ ment was madp, so aa to apply tct all other dutiable articles received in tbe mails from foreign countries.

AGBICULTUBAL BUREAU. My reoommendatiana in former messages are renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of the department of agriculture. Agriculture is the leading intereat and the permanent indus­ try of our people. It is to the abundance of agricultural productions, as compared with our home consumption, and the largely in­ creased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent Tears, that we are mainly indebted for our present prosperity as a people. We must look to ita oontinued maintenance for substantial resource. These is no branch of iuduatry in which labor directed by scientific knowledge yields such Increased production in comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of tbe publio servioe toWfich the encoursge msot ot liberal ^impropriations can be more apprOJHlately extended. The ommissibn to reiqer such aid ik llbt a' wise economy, bnt on the eonttsrr, tadlorttedljr result, in the Iqyy. of Immrtrte sams annnally, tkat mjght. W saysd through wsll^tfeeted government to promote iUs vU ItsI l«ts*e* resalts Steady a*oom- placed at tbe command of tbe department of agriculture is an earnest of what may be ex­ pected with increased appropriations for tbe several purposes indicated in the report of tbe commissioner. With a view to: placing the department upon a footing which wilt enable it to prosecute more effectively the objects for which- it is established appropriations are needed for a mora complete laboratory for the estab­ lishment of a veterinary division and a division of forestry and for an increase of force. The requirements for these and other purposes in­ dicated in tbe report of tb^commiseioner, un­ der the head of immediate nece? sities of the de­ partment, will not involve any expenditure of money that tbe country cannot with propriety now undertake in the interest of a^ricnTtnre." THE CAPITOL LIBRARY. To preserve and perpetuate, the national literature should be among the foremost cares of the national legislature. Tbe library gathered at tbe capitol still remains unpro­ vided with any suitable accommodations for its rapidly increasing stores. The magnitude and importance of tbe collection, increased aa it is by the deposits under tbe laws of copy­ right, by domestic and foreign exchanges, and by tbe scientific library of the Smithsonian institution, call for building accommodations which shall be at once adeqnate and fire proof. Tbe location of sncb public buildipgs, which should pi ovSde for the pressing nece-sities of tho present and for the vast increase of the nation's books in the future, is a matter which addresses itself to tbe discretion of Congress. It is earnestly recommended as a measure which should unite all suffrages and which should no longer be delayed. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. In former messages, impressed with the im­ portance of the subject, I have taken occasion to recommend to Congress the adoption of a generous policy toward the District of Colum­ bia- Tbe rep.'rt of the commissioners of tbe Distriot, herewith transmitted, contain consid­ erations and recommendations, to all of which I earnestly invite careful attention. I ask early and favorable consideration of the views which they express as to the urgent need of legislation for the reclamation of tbe marshes of the Potomac and its eastern branch within the limits of the city, and for the re­ pair of the streets of the capital heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and by. delay rendered almost impassable, and a source of imminent danger to the health of its citizens. The means at the disposal of the commissioners are wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of these important works, and should be supple­ mented by timely appropriations from the federal treasury. ThefiJliDgof tbe flat# front of the city will add" to the adjacent iands and (.arks now owned by the United States a large and valu­ able domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reim­ burse its entire cost, and will also, as an in­ cidental result, secure the permanent improve­ ment of the river for the purpose of naviga­ tion. Tbe constitution has invested Congress with supreme aDd exclusive jurisdiction orer the District of Columbia. Its citizens must of necessity look to Congress alone for all needful legislation affecting their interests and as the territory of this District is the common proper­ ty of the people of the United States who, equally with its resident citizen*, are interest­ ed in the prosperity of their capital. I can not doubt that you will be amply sustained by the general voice of the conntry in any measuM you may adopt for this purpose. I also Invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the wants of the public schools of this District, as exhibited in the report o? the commissioners. While the number ot the pu­ pils is rapidly increasing, no adequate pro­ vision exists for a corresponding increase of school accommodation, and the commissioners are without the means to meet this urgent need A num­ ber of the buildings now used for school pur­ poses are rented, and are in important particu­ lars unBuited for the purpose. 'I he cause of popular education in tbe District of Columbia is surely entitled to tbe same consideration at the hands of tbe national government as in tbe several States and Territories, to which muniticent grants of the public lands havo been made for the endowment of schools and universities. RUTHERFORD B. UATES. Executive Mansion, Dec. 1st, 1870. Aniiual Report of the Secretary of the Interior. WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.—The secretary of the nterior in his annual report to tbe President disposes of the Indian question. He says: 'Whatever trouble and perplexities the pres­ ence of Indians among us may cause, every man who loves justice and who values tho honor of the American name will admit it is a solemn duty to leave nothing untried to pre­ pare a better fate than extermination and a better rule than that of brute force for tho original occupants of the soil on which so many milliors of our people hav: grown pros­ perous and happy. That all Indians ou this northern continent have been tavapee, aiul that many of them are savages now, is true, but it is also true that many tribes have risen to a Drornislng degree of civilization, and there is no reason to doubt chat the rest, if wisely guided, will be found capable of following their example. Of the hundred and bfty-lwo thousand Indians in tbe United Stales, there­ fore, since the pacification of tbe Sioux, tbe-o bas been s. no time more than fifty thousand in hostile conflict with tbe whites. Neither docs it appear that such partial dis­ turbances have been provoked by the abseccn or prevented by the presence of a miiiiatv forces. Of four disturbances that have oc­ curred within the last two years, three broke out in the immediate presence of such military force, aid only one without it* At this mo­ ment a band of ltss tbaa 800 united and another of about 100 Indian marauders in New Mexico, in all less than 1,000 of an Indian pop­ ulation of a quarter of a million, are causing serious trouble. In fact, the number jf white desperadoes who were within the past twelve months band­ ed together in New Mexico for murder and ra­ pine, was larger than that of the Indians re­ cently on tbe war path near tbe southern part of the territory. While I am by all means disposed to f-ettlo the deplorable matter of Indian disturbance*, and to acknowledge the great value of the mili­ tary force in suppressing them, it is but juac (0 the Indians to point out tbe important fact tbit diBtut bancs and hostility is the exception and peaceable conduct tbe rule, that a very large majority of tbe Iedian rcseivations are in a condition of unintcrupted qniet witbout presence of co­ ercing iorce, and tbe equally significant ex­ perience that tke more civilised an Indian be­ comes the more certainly can bis peaceable and orderly conduct be depended upon. The secretary claims to have au Indian po i cy, and says: The ends steadily purnued by the department are the following: First—To set the Indians to work as agricul­ turalists, or herders, and thus to break up their habits of savage life and to make tbem self-supporting. Second—To educate their youth of both sexes. So as to introduce to the growing genera­ tion civilized ideas, wants and aspirations. Third—To allot parcels of lands to the In­ dians in severalty and to give them individual title to their farms in fee inalienable for a cer­ tain period, thns to foster the pride of indiv­ idual ownership of property, instead of their former dependence npon the tribe with ita ter­ ritory had in common. Fourth—When settlement in severalty with individual title is accomplished, to dispuse with their consent of those lands of their reter-: vations which are not settled and used to their proceeds to farm a fund for their benefit, which will gradually relieve the government of tho expenses at present provided lor by annual ap propriatiops. Fifth—When this is accomplished to treat Indians like other inhabitants of the (Jailed Stitcs under the laws of tbe land. This policy, if adopted and supported by ingress and carried out with wixdom and firmness, will, in my opinion, gradually bring about the solntion of the Indian problem withont injustice to Indians and also witbout obstructing the development of the country. It will raise them to a level of civilization, at least equal to that of the civilized tribes in the Indian Territory, and probably higher, considering the stimulus of individual ownership in the land. It will not take away from them by force what in justice and equity belongs to tbem, bnt induce tbem to part with what they cannot cultivate and u*e themselves for faij compensation. It will op'in to progress and improvement large districts now held by the Indians, which will then be of no real advan tage to them and are now to nobody else. Referring to the assertions frequently made that tribal relations must be broken up, and the reservation system must be abandoned, Secretary Soburz observes that an attempt to establish these objects at once all over the country without intermediate stages by mili­ tary force, wonld undoubtedly result in many cases in Indian wars of unprecedented magni­ tude and bitterness, which wonld requires mncb larger army than we at present possess, and prove in the end not only most inhuman, but in blood and treasuro most expensive of all wars. Tbe secretary says tbe cause of tbe pt? trouble cannot be found in any just complain^ on the part of the Utes. It is expected the oc­ currence of their trouble and transactions fc' lowing thereupon will result in such arrange­ ments as will be calculated to prevent for thi future hostile compact between tjie white in, habitants and Indians in that part of the ooun try. THE area of Ireland is about that of the State of Indiana there are 32,000 square miles of land, of which 8,000 are mono tain, bogs, lakes, or waste, and about 24,000 are adapted to agriculture. Of course, a less quantity is capable of high. cultivation. Upon. this, limited area of land theie is now a population in round numbers of 5,700,000, of whom three-quarters are fanners. This is about three times the population of In­ diana. The rent paid by the farmei tec ants for the use-of, this land aggre­ gates over £13,000,000, or about $65,, 000,000 a year.
