The New Meamirc. A measure baa been prepared by the appro priate congressional committee cm bodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested! which will be promptly submitted for'legisla tive action. It is the result of much patriotic and unselfish work, and I believe it deals with ‘"s subjects consistently and thor oughly as existing conditions permit I am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed legislation added to existing internal revenue taxation will in the near future, though perhaps not im mediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government. The committee after full consideration, and to provide m..dost a temporary deficiency which mar exist fore '-*•(- ou.-, oX the country adjusts itself Uj the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few additional internal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes de rived from certain corporate investments Viil) Not lit :irl Ifiislness. These new assessments are not only abso Jutely Just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted without,unfavorable basin* disturbance when ever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists.

In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that its Hiicc'-ss can only be Itv i :ie>i 1 , y pjeans of unselfish coensei on the part of the friends of tarjf reform and as a result of their willingne.-;., to subordii.afe personal oersirra and ambitions to the general good.

A CAT WITH FALSE TEETH. Tried to Scratch Them Out at First, but Finally Wore Them. The cat that owned the false teeth had lost his own, and had his jaws 1 broken besides by a drunken wretch who beat him with a cobble stone. With great care the poor animal final ly recovered; but he had to be fed * with a little milk in a spoon for a long I time. When able to pursue his ordi i nary business of catching rats and mice, he could not eat them because he had no teeth to chew with. Some thing must be done for him, for life ! supported on “spoon vittles” was a burden; and a young dentist in the I neighborhood, who had become great jly interested in the unfortunate cat, resolved to try the experiment of making him a set of false teeth. Taking the cast of the plate was a terrible piece of work, as Captain ob jected to it with all his might, but nothing to what followed when the teeth weie fairly in. If the animal had plunged and scratched while the plate was being fitted, lie acted like a mad thing win u it was firmly attached to his jaw, although it was well made and fitted perfectly. He could not understand that it would enable him to continue the lux urious feasts to which he had been accustomed, anti for several days he i was furious over it. Every possible j and impossible scheme was tried to j get the uncomfortable thing out of his j Laouth; lie tore at, it with his claws, j he shook his head violently to make it i drop out, ln> butted against heavy ; pieces of furniture, and if any one j came near him he growled and i scratched at them. There seemed to be danger of his going mad, anti his friends were sore ly puzzled <o know what to do with him, when, greatly to their relief, he calmed down and appeared to have come to tint conclusion that his new possession was, after all, a blessing in disguise. He was at once more gentle anti affectionate, as he had been previous to his misfortune; and the plate was now often taken out between meals anti put back again. In this way it was worn comfortably for over a year. Harper’s Young People. HOW OUR WORDS ORIGINATE. Daisy is tin* day's eye, or the eye of day. a name applied to this flew or bo eanse of its fancied resemblance to the sun. Milliners first applied their trade Milan, and to lie a Milaner wan equivalent to being able to prepare an elegant headdress. Buttercup was named thus from an old idea that butter was colored be cause* of these flowers being eaten by cows. Foxglove is a, corruption of folks glove, tin* allusion being to the fairies and to Ihe resemblance to the linger of a glove. Bayonet was so called because it was first made at Bayonne, in France. It was originally a knife stuck in the muzzle of a gnu. Biscuit meant baked twice, sea biscuits being formerly so prepared to enable* them to remain eatable during a long voyage. Stocks are so called because the stock market in London where securi ties were first handled had a pair of stocks in front. Rivals were once the men who lived on opposite sides of a brook or stream and quarreled with each other a bon! the water. Tap paper was thus called because, formerly, before being used by grocers in wrapping up goods, it was folded in a cap like form. Canoe, chocolate, hominy, maize, opossum, tomato, tomahawk and some others have come to us from various Indian languages. Bunch is the Hindoo word for five, because live ingredients—arrack, sugar, tea. lemons and water—enter into its composition. COST OF A BILLIARD BALI Abcnl sio in Cash and a Largo Amount of Human Blood. The globe of ivory which is knocked about a table in a game of billiards costs, if of good quality, at least $lO, says the Million. This represents its cost in money. There is. however, a far more important and formidable element in the price which has been paid for it. The billiard ball of pure ivory represents, as it lies white and glistening upon the cloth, an expendi ture of human life blood as well as ol money. Elephants’ tusks are brought down to the African coasts by cara vans. generally in charge of Arabs, who have been trading in the interior. Very often they have picked up slaves as well as ivory. But this phase of the matter may be left out of the ac count. It is estimated that every huge caravan bringing ivory to the coast has cost more than 100 human lives through fights and murders in the course of the expeditions. Thirty more men are likely to have succumbed to fevers or other diseases and the fatigues of the march. The hunting of the elephants and the capture of the ivory are very likely to have caused the death of ton men altogether. Such casualties are the rule in elephant hunting rather than the exception. An average tusk does not furnish more than enough material for two good billiard balls. ;>f course the remainder of the ivory in each tusk is made use of in other ways; a perfect cut billiard ball re quires special quality, or so-called “nerve.” which is found only in one part of the tusk. The chances are that a billiard ball of the first quality has cost at least one human life; and there is not one such ball which may not be truly said to bo stained with men’s blood. They can hardly be con sidered, therefore, a cheerful accom paniment to a sensitive person’s diver sion. Baroelonia police raided a nest of anarchists and captured a large amount of bombs.

A man said unto his angel: “My spirits are fallen through, And I cannot carry this battle; O brother! what shall 1 do? “The terrible Kings are on me, With spears that are deadly bright, Against me so from the cradle Do date and my fathers tight.” Then said to the man his angel: “Thou wavering, foolish soul, Back to the ranks' What matter To win or to lose the whole. “As I judged by the little judges Who harken not well nor see? Not thus, by the outer issue, The wise shall interpret thee. “Thy will is the very, the only. The solemn event of things; The weakest of hearts defying is stronger than all these Kings? “Though out of the past they gather Mind's doubt and bodily pain, And pallid thirst of the spirit That is kin to the other twain. “And grief, in a cloud of banners, And ringlet ted vain desires, And vice, with the spoils upon him Of thee and thy beaten sires, “While Kings of eternal evil Yet darken the hills about, Thy part is with broken saber To rise on the last redoubt; “To fear njt sensible failure, Nor covet the game at all, But lighting, lighting, lighting. Die, driven against the wall!” —Boston Pilot. R J-Jear. A Fire-Hunt on the Little Led in the I'm- West. l>y T. ('. Harbangh. The homes of the Duncans and Tay lors were situated near the Little Red. a swift stream that flowed through a region hut little opened as yet, and still inhabited by the animals of tin west. Indeed, bears roamed at will through the dense cane brakes, and not infre quently made reprisals on the scatter ed settlers. Wolves, too, abounded in the region, and in winter their long, dismal howling made tin* cold nights hideous. The Duncan and Taylor boys—Roy and Phil—had been companions from childhood, and when their parents set tled in the new country they were in their element, as they could roam tin woods or paddle down (he Little Red. every now and then picking up a bear or turkey with their trusty rifles. It was not long before they became known as the best young Nimrods In the whole district, and whenever they started on a hunt it was taken for granted that they womd return with a well-tilled bag. One of their favorite methods of bag ging wild game was by the tire-hunt, and these adventures generally took place on the river. They would set up their torch in the canoe, and while paddling up stream or floating with the current, would by its light see tin eyes of bear or deer on shore, and a shot was pretty sure to bring down the fascinated targets. Tin* night la-fore Thanksgiving Phil Taylor strolled over to tin- Duncan homestead with a proposition almost sure to find favor with his young com panion. This was nothing less than a lire hunt on the river for the purpose of. as Phil expressed it. “bagging a Thanksgiving beat/' “We can float past the big brakes near the bend,” said he, as he laid his proposition before Roy. “Tom Hunter, who came through there the other day, saw lots of fresh signs, and we may be able to get a big one for tomorrow’s feast.” Taken with the prospect of sonic exciting adventure, Roy at once ac quiesced, and tin- two boys began to prepare for the fire-hunt. The canoe was dragged forth, and the pine knots for the torch gathered and made ready. A torch of pine knots, if fashioned properly, will throw a fierce glow for many rods over the water, and animals will come to the shore and gaze at it, fascinated, as it were, until the unerring bullet of the hunter in the canoe terminates their careers. The young hunters of the Little Red waited with some impatience for night fall, and when the hour came they launched the canoe and sprang into it. The torch had been placed in the stern of the boat, and Phil who was to have the first shot, took his seat underneath it, in such a position that the lignt, streaming over him and from behind, would throw its radiance along the shore, thus revealing the gleaming eyes of the wolf or bear, but without the glare’s dazzling his own eyes. In some places the river was danger ous on account of unseen rocks over which the waters boiled like a cauld ron, while in others canoeing was per fectly safe; but the boys knew the stream well, and had paddled it on many occasions after dark. Taking the paddles, Roy, with a sharp lookout along shore, drove the light bark into the middle of the river, while Phil, under the torch, watched the tall canes that lined the edge and tried to catch the first sight of game. The night was calmly beautiful, and the paddles made no noise in the water as the canoe swept down stream. As they neared the bend where they ex pected to catch sight of a living target, Phil and Roy increased their watch fulness. All at once the paddle in Roy’s su ple hands seemed to rest, and he glanc ed at his companion. Phil at the same moment had seen what had caught Roy’s eye. On the right, where the till canes seemed to seek the solitude of the stars, gleamed a pair of intense eyes, very close together, and near the ground. “It is old Ephriam,” whispered Phil as he moved his rifle and leaned for ward for a better look. “We have found our Thanksgiving bear at last!” The canoe had reached a quiet place in the current and Roy had brought it to anchor there. “Don’t miss him,” he said to Phil. “In all my life I never saw eyes shine j so. I believe 1 can make out the out j lines of the boar’s head.” j Slowly, with a hunter’s cool delibera tion, Phil lifted the rifle to his should er, and while ho watched the shining eyes, Roy seemed to hold his breath. The crack of the weapon awoke the I echoes along shore, and as the smoke lifted both boys leaned forward with eagerness and looked toward the shore. "Von missed him!” cried Roy. “No. Look yonder! The old fellow has tumbled into the water and is in in the death struggle. Quick! row to ward him before the eddy sucks him in. We shall lose the bear if we are not careful.” Roy needed no urging to force the canoe through the water toward the spot where something was splashing among the rocks, and Phil, who had reloaded, was watching for another shot, as lie saw that the bear was desperately wounded though not yet quite conquered. I As the canoe neared the spot there j was a sudden plunge on the part of the | animal and the huge bulk vanished fol ia moment. | Lost! exclaimed Roy, disappoiuted ; ly. | Before I>hi l could reply, something jdaik and wet rose almost underneath ithe trail canoe, and the next moment jhe saw the taff-rail in the grip of a ; boar. j 1 great paws, looking doubly for- Jmidable in the unsteady light of the j torch, with the weight of the bear, ; threatened to overturn the boat, and | the ugly head, with the wide mouth ! bleeding from the boy’s shot, was; i enough to send chills of terror to the j Nimrods’ hearts. “Back oft! cried Phil, as he saw that jthe canoe was almost among the rocks : and liable to be capsized by their foe.' Roy sprang anew to the paddles, and , as I’hß rose in the boat to thrust the! t itle into the bear’s face and terminate | the contest, the animal made a des 'perate effort to climb aboard. * The situation was now full of peril ami the rocking of the boat in the swift ; waters caused the torch to scatter a rain of lire over the devoted boys and the bear, but the beast only blinked his little eyes and redoubled his efforts to scale the fragile rampart. Finding that he could not get a shot :it the bear as Roy backed the boat off, Phil struck with all his might with the gun, bringing the heavy stock down upon the huge head. He shattered the weapon by the blow, while he appar ently left the skull of his antagonist uninjured. In another moment 1 lie bear plunged forward again, and the canoe at the same time striking a rock was cap sized, spilling its occupants into the water and putting out the torch. All this happened in a second, as it seemed, and the boys thus thrown into the stream, and at the mercy of bear and current, struggled to right the canoe and clamber in again. Alter awhile they succeeded, and Roy, who was fortunate enough to re tain one paddle.pushed the boat from the rocks and sent it out into the river, where il was caught in a swift cur rent and carried along like a feather. "This is better than drowning among the rocks—or being oaten up by the bear.” said Phil, as he looked back, "But we've lost onr Thanksgivng bear steak, I guess.” “Lost the bear!” cried Roy sharply as his face whitened. “Look yonder. He is still clinging to the stern of the boat.” This was true, as could be seen by the moonlight which at that particular place fell through the trees upon the eddying waters. The two boys stared at the homely head lifted above the tide and at the sharp claws that seemed to dig their way into the woodwork at the stern. The boar hold on with a doath grip as the current bore the canoe and I he young Ni in rods rapidly down stream, now narrowly missing some half-sunken trees, and now nearly cap-' sizing again as Roy tried to escape a hidden rock. ‘■What shall we do?” cried Phil at last as he turned a frightened face toward Ins companion. “The bear is deter-1 mined to prove our Jonah, and in a short time we shall reach the falls.” “Cut him loose,” said Roy. “You have your knife, haven’t you?” Phil hailed the suggestion with a cry of joy and brought from the depths of his pocket a big jack-knife, and in another moment ho leaned to ward the bear in their wake. Instead of striking at the throat, which was exposed, he drove the keen blade into one of the feet near the root of the claws and drew it toward him. The bear growled savagely, but Phil bravely faced the beast and severed the other foot likewise. “A tree! a tree!” rang out Roy’s voice at this moent, and before Phil could duck his head the canoe struck the ob stacle in the middle of the Little Red, and in a jiffy they were in the water again and struggling to grasp the limbs of the lodged tree. In this they were successful, and when they had drawn themselves up among the branches they looked at one another with grim smiles. They knew that they were destined to pass the night in the tree, which they did, and when day came they found themselves near a plantation. By dint of shouting until they were hoarse they made themselves heard, and were rescued by several plantation hands, one of whom discovered the bear lodged in another tree a little | farther down the river. I The animal was dead, and when he | was drawn ashore the boys related their thrilling experience with his bear ship the night before, i A wagon was procured and the home 'ward journey begun, and in ample season for dinner the boys arrived with the Thanksgiving near. The canoe which had been swept un derneath the tree was never found, but Phil and Roy were willing to lose jit since they had saved themselves and the well-won body of Old Ephraim; hut the next Thanksgiving, and the next, they were careful to provide for by daylight, for their thrilling fire hunt on the Little Red was not soon forgotten. DR. MEYER’S TRIAL. New York. Dec. 2.—The trial of Dr. Henry C. W.

READING OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

MESSAGE LISTENED TO. Representatives Very Attentive, But Senators Get Tired —Secretary Omits the Page Relating to Hawaii and is Made to Read It —Dolph Speaks First on Hawaii. I N\ ashiugtou, Nov. 4. —The encircling galleries of the house, except those re served for the president and diplomatic corps, which looked gloomy and vacant, were tilled to overflowing with eager and expectant persons when Speaker Crisp, dignified and stately, ascended the rostrum at high noon today and rapped the regular session of tin* fifty third congress to order. I ally oOU members were in their seats. Conspicuous upon the floor were tin* two vacant chair of Representa tive O’Neill, of Pennsylvania, the "fath ei of the house, and his colleague, Mr. Lilley, the representutive-at-large from the Keystone state. Their desks were diaped in black anil covered with floral tributes. j The Rev. Mr. Bagby, in bis invo cation, referred feelingly to the deaths ;of “Father” O’Neill and Mr. Tilley. According to the rule at the opening of the session, the speaker then di rected the roll in order to officially as certain the presence of a quorum. At 1:05 o’clock the president’s mes sage was brought iu and read. The reading was listened to with marked attention. Recommendations relative to the in ternational monetary conference and a request for further authority for an issue of bonds caused many significant shakes of the head on the part of the extreme silvermen. The president’s bold endorsement of the pension policy of the interior de partment, civil service reform and an appeal for rigid economy in appropri ations also,' attracted attention. 11 is forceful utterance relative to the duty of congress on the tariff question and the hearty endorsement given the Wil son bill seems to please the democratic members greatly, but much surprise was evident when the section of the message was read stating that the ways and means committee had em braced in its plan several additional internal revenue taxes, and a small tax on incomes of corporations. A roar of applause greeted the conclusion of the message. A touching tribute was paid to the memory of Representatives O’Neill and Lilley after which the usual resolutions were adopted and a committee was appointed to attend O’Neill’s funeral, then as a further mark of respect the house adjourned. SEX AT K. The first senate session of the fifty third congress assembled at noon. On many desks were tloral tributes from admirers. Vice-President Stevenson had been remembered with a large basket of roses. The galleries were well tilled, and a touch of color was lent to the scene by bright winter toilets of the ladies present. After the vice-president's gavel fell the blind chaplain was led to the desk and delivered an eloquent prayer. Roll call showed fifty-six senators present. After the passage of the usual resolution notifying the house* of the meeting of the senate and the appointment of a committee from the house to wait on the president and notify him of the assembling of con gress, and one fixing the time of meet ing at noon each day, the senate took a recess of an hour, to enable the com mittee to wait on the president. Uu reassembling the committee to wait on the president announced the accomplishment of its duty and that the president would at once communi cate with the senate. Secretary ITu deu then stepped forward and deliv ered the message to the vice-president, who laid it before the house, and See retary Cox at once began its reading. All present, with a few exceptions, gave close attention when the reading began. There was a general changing about in seats when the portion of the document dealing 'with Hawaii was approached. Many senators an ticipated the secretary’s reading by turning to their printed copies, so very few of them, apparently, observed that the page containing the presi dent's brief communication on Ha waii was turned without being read by the secretary. Senator Kyle called attention to the oversight by sending up a note calling attention to the fact. The senators gradually left their seats and went out into tlie cloak room, so by the time the reading was two-thirds concluded only twenty-five senators were in the chamber and a majority of these were engaged fu conversation. The reading of the message wes concluded at 3 o’clock, having occupied approximately an hour and a indf. Uolph. rep., of Oregon, immediately rose and said there had been dis tribted in the senate printed copies what purported to be the message of the president, in which, on page nine, he found a part of a page devoted to Hawaii and he did not hear that por tion read from the desk. He desired to know, and thought the country did also, whether the part was inadvert ently or purposely omitted by the secretary, or whether the copies which had been circulated were not true copies of the message. The vice-president responded that the portion of the message relating to Hawaii was inadvertently omitted by the secretary and directed it to be read. This was done and Dolph gave notice that he would on tomorrow ad dress the senate on that part of the message. The message was ordered to lie on the table and numerous petitions and bills were introduced and referred to appropriate committees. A message was received from the house an nouncing the deaths of Hon. Charles O'Neill ami Hon. Win. Lilly, repre sentatives from Pennsylvania. Mr. Cameron. rep., of Pennsylvania, of fered suitable resolutions and a com mittee was appointed to attend the 1 iinerals As an additional mark of respect the senate then adjourned.
