This ifternoon and to-morrow morning millions of people will read at least a part-of Piesident Roosevelt's mes-sage to the Fifty-ninth Congress delivered In Washington to-day The salient points of tho message are what the Presiient says on corporations, with especial 'recommendations lor railroad rate legislation; his words on the Insurance question and his slight reteranco to the tariff. These are given in lull in to-day's Issue of the West Vlmlnlaa (Vwr .roaHnro ri'ill rrr .1 to f ??0?HIUtU VUI lV-UUl.t?J TT.lt h-. W l? see what the President has to say many hours before those who wait for the morning papers from Wheeling and Pittsburg. The President doesn'i mlnoe words as to his Ideas on what the government should do in the matter of regulating the operations of the great corporations. He recommends that ti system of examinations into Ihe accounts of railroads should be proi vided similar to the bank examiner's province wlQi the national banks of the country. He says tf railroads make a special rate to afly large shipper that rate ought to be fixed by a commission as the maximum rate to be charged by the read. That would effectually check the speciai privilege rate. lie also cries out against the free pasf evil. One interesting recommendation made is that Oklahoma and Indian Terr'tcry be admitted as one State and Arizona and New Mexico jointly as another. The message consists of 5G pages In book form and is exceedingly Intesesting 'rom start to finish. The West Virginian acknowledges the receipt of a very handsome pub!!. cation entitled "Manual of Physical Training." Professor Anthony V. . fhpz. nhvfilrnl director nf thn West Virginia University, Is the author of the booklet and be is certainly to bo congratulated on the excellence of Lis work. The manual Is replete with Interesting facts and suggestions and i? a model of excellence in design and mechanical make-up. Tho cuts, dingrams and Illustrations are all of high order, making the booklet a credit to 1U author and the University ?hose imprint It bears. This seems to be a time rife with newspaper changes. The Grafton Sentinel announces that the former editor, Mr. Jas. W.Holt, has again become half owner of that paper and will hereafter work In connection with Mr. Boldtn and Mr. Sayre In pushing forward Graf tan's only dally paper.

We 1 shall now expect even greater things I of the Sentinel than we have been accustomed to secLng. THE 

COAL AND COKE M. Jf Charleston is roJoIclnR over the fact thai on last Saturday the last spike la the rails forming the connection, between that.elly end Ell,Ins was driven end that In about two weoks through trains will-be running between Ih&two cities. We moat heartily felicitatai tin people of the soction through ^liljb the Coal and Coke railway passos and we are not unmindful of the factjltia' the Stato capital has been brftngl't much nearer to Fairmont and neighboring cities. A glance at the map shows that there Is only a slight curvaiuro in the lino drawn from Morrantown to Charleston?the lino thus made passing through Fairmont, Clarksburg ana wasum. 1 no umo o> iweon Fairmont and Charleston need not bo more than eight hours, If the proper connootion la maslo at Burn" vlile and the train does not lay over, as at present, three hours at Clarksburg. The run from this city to Burntvlile can bo made in four hours easily, while the run from Burnsvllle to Charles too can bo mn/lo in like timo. Thus, with one chango, under a proper schedule, Fairmont people can teavo here In the morning nt say seven o'clock awl roach Charleston at about three o'clock In the afternoon. That will certaldly be a great Improvement over having to go 10 uiarasourg, nnu No. 3 late, miss connection at Parlcersburg, have a dolay at Pt Pleasart, reaching Charleston from twenty-four to thirty-sk hours after leaving this city, as at present. We Join Charleston in rejoicing over the completion of the Coal and Coke. Editor Morris, of the Parkersburg State Journal, says his life Is too short to read long editorials. He should have the same respect for other people's Uvea as for his own. Whon ho does not uso all his space mmtini: what the Fairmont West Vlr ginlan safj about him, ho writes editorials as long as tbo moral law.? Morgantown Chronicle. Editor Morris Is too great a man to be consistent. Consistency such as the Chronicle man seems to long foils found only In narrow minds, at least that Is what Emerson once in tlmated and we suppose it Is so. ..vnyhow, wo won't allow the editor of the State Journal criticised without entering a protest. Tlie ParVcraburg News-Dispatch bids fair to be the name of a lusty journal published on the Wood county sldo of the Ohio, In the near future, according to current gossip.

Mr. Brohard was one of Taylor county's loading citizens and was well known throughout the State. The Clarksburg Telegram Is a subject of congratulation. It has been sued for $10,000 damages. Of course It is not yot in the west Virginian s class, but it shows evidence of progress. A DEMOCRAT Was Elected Mayor of Portland, Maine Yesterday. PORTLAND.

The train stops down by the scale house a yard englno couples to tho rear, backs around awhlie and aftor a delay of from five to ton miuuteo, pushes the train to the station. For this reason, it is tbouKht, the dispatcher at Grafton refuses to hold 71 for the connection when BO is late, as he considers the delay entirely useless.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.?The Hepbum bill, appropriating JIG,500,000 Imedlatoly available to continue the work on the Isthmian canal, will be passed through the House to-morrow or Thursday without reference to a committee, either by unanimous consent or by a spoclal rule. It la -essential that action on this bill should be taken before the holiday recess by both houses and as the House committees will not be appointed until shortly before the recess, it was deemed necesary to handle the matter thus expeditiously.
