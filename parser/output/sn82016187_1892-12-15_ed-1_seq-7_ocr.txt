Ex-Secretary of State Blaine was roporled so much bettor to-day that bo intended to take a drive in the afternoon, but was prevented from doing so by iho con stant stream of friendly visitors at his homo on Lafayette Square. It is B&id that ho cats heartily and sleeps well, nnd that all dauber is passed. Ho remains in the bouse, but is not confined to his bed. Members of tho Central Conference of American Eabbis be- f;an arriving and were quite numerous in the obbies of Willard's Hotel, which is the head quarters. A. meeting of the Executive Com mittee was held in tho evening, to arrange for tho conference to-morrow.

Tho case of Cross, the convicted wife-murderer, whose sentence of death has been postponed from time to time during tho past year, was settled to-day by tho Qui tod States Supreme Court refusing a writ of habeas corpus. Tho court held that tho Dis trict courts had tho power to suspend their Eentences from time to time, especially when it was done at tho instance of defendant, pending motions for new trial. Tho only re sort Cross now has is Executive clemency, 'which bis counsel will at once urge. STjesdjly, Dec. 6. Gen. W. a Eosccrans, Eegistcr of the Treasury, who has been quite ill fc'iseveral weeks, and who latoly returned fro -Tort Monroe, where ho went for change of air and rest, and was reported to be in a dy ing condition after his return, was very much better to day, and about 11 o'clock at night ho ato heartily. A peculiar phase of tho General's disease is his abnormal appetite, and his impatience over any delay in serving his me;.ls cannot be restrained. His phyEi cian believes the General will now recover. The Carroll Institute, a Catholic society of tho tity, inaugurated a fair at their rooms this evening, there being a large attendanco of people. An orchestra was in attendanco nnd at 10 o'clock tho floors wore cleared and those present enjoyed a dance. Wednesday, Dec. 7. Eov. Frank String fellow, who was a trusted scout of Gen. R.

Th6 accident hap pened while the workmen wero at dinger, and the bole was left without safeguard. Mrs. Freeh bustained a fracture of tht right thigh. Her escape from dea h was miraculous as Ehe fell on a hardenrface. Mr. L. D. Wine, who was commander of the Citizens' Escort at the grand parade curing tho National En campment of the G.A.E. laBt September, was presented by his associates on that occasion with a handsome tablo service of solid silver to-night.

He Tecently sold a pi ceo of property for S50. and carried the monoy to Lis home sod put it, as ho thought, in a safe place, along with some other money. Some colored men were at work in the yard repair ing the pump.

Soley, died at the residence of her son in Washington on "Wednesday, Dec 7, in the 83d year of hor age. The remains were taken to Massachusetts for interment. Col. John L. Jolley, memher of Congress from South Dakota, while on his way to Wash ington last week to attend the opening of Con gress, received a telegram announcing the seri ena illness of his father in Canada. His father is a very aged man, and Col. Jolley hastened So his bedside. At the meeting of tho Trustee of tho Ameri ca University, held at tho Arlington Hotel in W&fihiugiou on Wednesday, Dec 7, Mrs. Gen. John A. Logan was elected President of tho American University League, an organization f tho women of the country, who are expectod to raise $1,0011,000 for building the University. Capt Isaac Bassett, the venerablo Door kcopor of the United States Senate, who has just completed 61 years of service in the Sen ate, keeps his snuff in a box that was given him by Daniol Webster. Among the distin guished men who have taken a pinch from the , Captain's historic box at e nearly all of the great Tho great social card this season In Wash ington will be tho Prince of Iseuberg, of Ans tria, who, with a suite of eight persons, has been making a tour of this country.

Sus picion pointed very strongly to a young man named Jones Seehan, who left tho place with Danenhowcr a few minutes beforo the robbery was discovered. Officers Homo and Sullivan nrrestcd Sceban about 11 o'clock Wednesday night, and when ho was searched at tho station the pension check was found on him. He was charged with larceny from tho person. News was received hero last week of the killing in Carrollton, Miss., of Edward Eiam by George D. Money, son of Eeprcsontative olect Money, of the Fourth Mississippi District. Young Mouey is well known in Washington, having resided hero for several years, and was Assistant Superintendent of tho Document Boom of tho House when his father was a member of Congress. Elam was tho Chairman of the People's Party Executive Committee of tho County, and young Monoy is a practicing lawyer and a Democrat. Politics was tho causo of the quarrel which led to tho shooting, which is said to have been dono by Money in self-defense. The Secretary of State and Mrs. John W. Foster gave on Wednesday evening, Doc 7, the first of a series of Diplomatic dinners, in honor of tho Spanish Minister and Madam Dupuy de Lome. In compliment to the guests of honor tho decorations of the table wero in the Spanish colors, red and yellow.

Hill, of Now York, would Tosign his seat in tho Senate to accept the position of General Counsel of tho New York Equitable Life Assurance Society. Sena tor Hill, when shown a dispatch to that effect published in a daily paper, said: "I havo soen the dispatch to tho effect that I had been offered tho position of Chief Counsel to tho Equitable Life Assurance Society at a salary of $25,000 a year, and that I would prob ably accept. I shall not take tho timo to deny it, or to dignify such assertions with a dcuial. My duties in tho Senate will bo sufficient to oc cupy my working hours." e The Joint Committeo on Printing of tho House and Senate at its meeting on Tuesday, Dec C, had under consideration the selection of a site for tho new Government Printing Office. Nearly two dozen picce3 of ground wore offered, and the prices wero a3 widely apart as the localities. Tho Committee agreed to report in favor of square 713, the property of E. Kurtz Johnson. Tho ground contains 106,000 square feet, and tho consideration to be paid is $1 per foot. Tho block faces 401 feet on L streot, 311 feet on K street, 336 feet on Dela ware avenue, and 323 feet on First street north oast. This is two blocks northeast of tho loca tion of tho building at present in use. a The District Courts woro in a crippled con dition last week. Judge McComas, recently appointed to the bench, was called to his homo in Hagerstown, Md., by tho dangerous illness of his daughter, and Judge Cox was obliged to occupy hii position in the Criminal Court during tho week. Becauso of this but two Justices were loft to sit iu the Court in General Term, as the vacancy left by tho retirement of Judge James has not yet been filled by Presi dent Harrison, aud tho work of that court is practically at a standstill. The jurors who had been drawn for tho December term of the Circuit Court presented themselves at the proper timo, were paid for ono day's attendanco, and excused. . Capt George H. Travis, a well-known 'char actor about Washington, was found dead on a cot in his room at tho Madison Houso, 333 Mis souri avenue northwest, at 12:30 o'clock on Wcdnoslay, Dec 7. Travis was an old vet eran, having lost an arm in the lato war. He drew his pension on Tuesday last. Lato Tues day night ho let himself in with a night-key and retired to his room. Thursday about noon tLo chambermaid went to Travis's room, but found tho door locked. She detected a strong odor of gas and called to tho proprietor, Mr. John A. Frcy, who forced tho door open and found Travis, fully dressed, lying on a cot. Tho windows were closed aud the gas burner turned on at a full head. The remains were removed to the morgue and tho Coroner notified. Eoprcsontativc Michael D. Hartor, of tho Fifteenth Ohio District, introduced a bill in the Houso last week that troats tho financial question in an entirely new manner. It pro vides for tho cessation of silver bullion pur chases on Jan. 1, 1S93, and for the sale of 100, 000,000 ounces of silvor bullion for gold. Mr; Hartor thinks the continuance of silver pur chases would only increase the ultimato enor mous losses of tho country growing out of tho act of March, 187S; that these purchases woro dostroying confidence at homo and abroad, and stand in tho pathway of National prospority to day. Tho cossation of these purchases of silver would, he thinks, cause a renewal of foreign purchases of American securities upon a large scale. Tho repeal of tho pro3ont law would start gold from Europe toward America. A committeo of Police Stationkecpors of Washington appeared before tho House Committeo on Appropriations last week, aud presented a requost for an incroaso iu tlioir pay from $G0 per month, tho present rate, to that of tho socond-class of police privates of $75 per month. Tho District Commissioners and Chief of Pollco woro pres ent at the Capitol and indorsed tho request. The members of tho committoo made strong argumonts for their increaso, and presented the records of tho different stations to show tho amount of work they aro compelled to porform for a small salary. Thoy are also responsible for tho safety of prisoners and tho care of the stations. They claim that their work is more arduous than that of any $1,500 Government clerk. - A party of officials and capitalists loft Wash ington on Wcdnosday evening, Doc 7, for Flor ida. The party consisted of Secretary of Agri culturo Busk, Prof. H. W. Wiley, Chemist of tho Dopartment of Agriculture; Congressmen Hatch, Chairman of tho Houso Committeo on Agriculturo; Huff and Harmor, of Pennsylva nia; Hamilton Disston, of Philadelphia, and several gentlemen associated with him in tho reclamation of a largo body of swamp land3 in that State. One of tho agricultural experi mental stations is located on this body of land, and tho officials go for the purposo of inspect ing the workings of it. Whilothero an inves tigation will bo miido, with a view to determin ing whether or not tho cane sugar industry can bo profitably established. Tho party will bo abseut about a week. Bopre3entativo "Buck" Kilgoro, of Toxas, was on hand when Congress assembled, and, as usual, is ready to kill all tho private pension bills that may be offered. He has tho reputa tion of being a "hard kicker," having kicked down a door of tho Houso during tho 5l3t Con gress, which had beon closed by order of Speaker Beod to keep a quorum in the chamber, as well as having persistently "kicked" against all legislation on private pension bills. "Yon can't fool mo on quorums," ho remarked ono day last week as ho ro3o and swopt his ex perienced and calculating eye around tho Houso. "There are enough of ns hero to do business. Let them bring on their private pen sion bills. I'll not object. But I would hato to seo four or five of us get up and go out. That would bo different." Boprcsontativo Bobert E. Hitt, of tho Sixth District of Illinois, entertained several mem bers of tho family of eJ.-Secretary of State Blaine, at dinuor, on Wednesday evening, Dec 7. Speaking of Mr. Blaine's condition, Mr. Hitt said: "I am glad to say that tho ex Secretary ha? improved very wonderfully in health. Ho gets around tho houso, and yester day ho wont out for a drive. Ho is so much better that ho is saying his old bright things inj, his old bright way. Tho fact of the mattor'is that ho has been dreadfully cut up over tho death of his boy Emmons. That explains his recent gloominess and saduess. Coining so 6oon after the death of his eldest son, Walker, the blow was naturally a very severe one. I hope to see Mr. Blaine restored to his usual vigor in a very short time." Senator Matt. Quay, of Pennsylvania, was placed in a rather embarrassing position Inst week, and ono which threatened destruction to his hopes of ro-election to tho United States Senate. Howjie succeeded is not now known. A Philadelphia delegation was in Washington to induco him to support a Philadolphian for Speaker of tho Pennsylvania Legislature, which meets in January, whilo at the same time a country delegation wa3 here to got him to support the country candidate for tho Speak ership. Both delegations promised Senator Quay to support him for ro-election in return for his influence for their candidate, and it is said that each threatened troublo if ho refused to favor their candidato. Mr. Quay has been endeavoring to keep out of the Speakership fight, but it appears that his constituents will not pe.'tnit him to do so. Tho Democrats aro chuckling over and repeat ing what thoy consider a very good story, in which ex-Speaker Tom Beod, of Maine, figures as tho hero. While tho President's message wab being road on Tuesday, Dec 6, sogoc? the story, Mr. Bced valkcd up to tho Speaker's desk and, leaning over, drawled out to Speaker Crisp iu a stagfl voice that could bo heard 40 feet away, this question: "Will the Houso adjourn, Mr. Speaker, at tho conclusion of the ceremonies, out of respect to tho memory of the departed?" Private John Allen, of Mississippi, tho hu morist of the House, also made a comment on the message, which some of the members think is funnier than Mr. Reed's. "The mess'ige," said Mr. Allen, jusc as tho Clerk finished reading tho document, "sounds liko a motion for a now trial, but I don't think the country is truing to graut it." Congressman Amos J. Cummings, who served as Sergeaut-Major of tho 26th N. J., nnd wlio is also au old printer and newspaper man, nnd Walter Wellman, correspondent of one of the Chicago papers and President of the Prc3S Club of Washington, had a typesetting contest one day last weok. Tho Press Club were ex periencing souio difficulty in gotting a fow cir culars printed, and Maj. Cummings volunteorod to set the typo if thoy could find a printing office open. Mr. Wellman thereupon chal lenged the Congressman to a typesetting con test, which he at onco accepted. They repaired to a printing-office and began work. The room was warm and the light vory poor. Maj. Cum mings's eyeglasses would not stay upon his nose, aud he had to work without them. Ho was consequently beaten by Mr. Wellman by four minutes. Neither of the gentlemen had Eet typo in 15 years. 4 Complaints have been frequently made of late to the police officors of tho thoft of jars of milk left at tho doors of residoncc3 by tho milkmen in their early morning rounds. These complaints becamo so numerous that two officers in citizen's clothes wero detailed to mako investigation of the matter. On Friday morning, Dec 9, tho officers noticed two colored men acting in a suspicious mannor on I streot, aud thoy were followed.- Ono of tho men carried a basket, and thoy were seon to pick up several jars of milk. Thoy arrested one man and tho other made his escape. Tho man arrcstod assaullod Officer Oriuni and took to hia hools also. The officer gavo chase, and when he saw that the man was about to escape, he fired two shots after him. Tho second shot took effect in thejnogo'a back. Ho was taken to tho Emergency Hospital, whoro the physi ciaus stated that t?hcre,was little chauco for his recovery. 'I m a Tho Superintendonbof Chnrities of the Dis trict of Columbia has submitted to the District Commissioners a, billfto create a' Board of Charities for tho District. This Board is to bo composed of five members, who shall sorv without compensation, and are to bo appointed by the President of the United States upon tho recommendation of the District Commis sioners. Each sox must have at lonst ono rep resentative upon the Board. The Board is to appoint a Socrotary at a salary of $3,000 per year. This Board is to porform all tho duties horotoforo oxercisod by the prosont Superin tendent of Charitios, and the Superintendent is to net aa Secretary of the Board from tho dato of organization to not later than Aug. 1, 1893, after which dato tho office of Superin tendent is to bo abolished. Should this bill meet with the approval of the District Commis sioners, it will at onco bo submitted to Con gross. Tho Diplomatic circlo is rapidly filling np, and soon ovory legation will be open. The latest arrivals woro those of Mr. Patonotre, tho French Ministor, and Dr. Van Hollobon, tho German Minister, who returned to Washington last week. These two will be near neighbors this season, tho French Logation having been romoved to the rcsidonco of tho lato Justice Miller on Massachusetts avonuo, while Dr. Von Hollobon hns transferred tho German Lo gation from tho location on Fifteenth street, next to Wormley's Hotel, which it occupiod for many years, to a house in tho samo square with tho Millor residence. Thi3 block is high ground, and known in local parlance as " High land Torraco." Baron and Baronos3 Fava will roturn to Washington on tho 15th iust. and pivo Marquis Imporialll, Secretary of the Italian Legation, who has acted as Chargo d'Affaires during tho Baron's extended absonea from tho time of tho Now Orleans incidont, an opportunity to mako a visit homo. Last wook John H. Jackson, a colored Wash ington brokor, was romoved from hia position as committeo for John W. Clark, by Justice Bradloy, in tho Equity Court, and another man appointed in his stead. Clark is a negro pen sioner who ha3 been in tho Government Insano Asylum for some time, but ia reported to havo nearly recovered front his mental ailments. About throe months ago ho petitioned the court to relievo Jackson of his trust, on the ground that ho refused to account for tho money in hia chargo, or'disburse tho amount for Clark's ex penses. Tho caso was referred to Auditor Payne, and his report showed a shortage of $1,600 in Jacksou's accounts. The man's bonds man, who might havo been hold rosponsiblo for the shortage, dropped dead in Anacostia on Monday. It is thought that tho Pension Bu reau may take action against Jackson, becauso he drew Clark's ponsion of $72 a month by vir tue of his position, and according to testimony in the case represented to his chargo that tho pension was $o0 a month. Bepresentativo Stump, of Maryland, had a conference last week with Senator Chandler, of New Hampshire, .regarding tho immigration bill which tho Senator proposes to introduce, forbidding immigration for one year. Mr. Stump i3 tho Chairman of tho House Com mitteo on Immigration, and Sonator Chandlor holds a similar position in tho Sonato. Mr. Stump proposes to read and study Senator Chandler's bill, and if ho finds it all right, will introduco tho samo measuro in tho Houso, so as to facilitato action upon it. Mr. Stump thinks that tho authority of the Houso and, Sonato Committees to act jointly expired with the last session of Congress and ha3 not been rencvod. In tho meantime tho immigration bill that passed tho Senate last Spring is on tho Houso calendar, and an effort will ho made to get it up for action. If tho endeavor is success ful the proposed limitation act can be substi tuted if it is decmod v.iso to enact it into law. Both Senator Chandlor and Boprcsentative Stump wero very much pleased at tho utter ances of the President's message on the immi gration question. c ti Tho Democratic members of tho Sonato hold a caucus on Wednesday, Dec 7, and the usual steering committeo was appointed, consisting of fivo Senators, who will look after tho inter eats of tho Democratic party in all matters of legislation, and do the best to wield tho minor ity and maintain a sereno front, besido bracing up tho weak-kneed. It i3 understood that a committeo was also appointed, which will act as a law advisory body to Democratic members of Wc3torn aud Northwestern Legislatures, wherein tho voto is close and the ways of the wily enemy may bo dark, and whoro Sen atorial succession is a matter of deep concern aud trembling in tho balance Sonato caucuses never boforo furnished a precedent for such action as this, and it created considerable dis- MF 'VzSsSy KT -wv fn & rsa Is superior to all other preparations claiming to be blood-purifiers, lrst of all, because the principal ingredi ent used in it is the extract of gen uine Honduras sarsaparillaroot, tho variety richest in medicinal proper- Curss Catarrh causeihe'yoi- low dock, being raised expressly for tho Company, is always fresh and of tho very best kind.

Gold byalllDrugglata; Price $1; flix bottles, $5. Gures others, will cure you cussion. Republicans wero disposed to con sider it as a piece of uncalled-for statesmanship, likely to amount to littlo outsidu of tba news papers, while Domocrata regarded it as a wise measure. Tho namos of tho latter committee wore not given out, but a man who know said, "You can rest assured that It contain! the best logal minds on the Democratic side of the chambor, and our interests in the West will bo intelligently consorved." It subsequently appears that Senators Carlisle, Brlce, and Gor man woro appointed as this committoo. Tho Iowa colony in Washington are already canvassing tho prospects of the various candi dates who havo boen announced a3 the proba ble successor of Senator James F. Wilson, whose Sonatorial term will expire March 3, 1895. Nearly all tho porsons that havo been men tioned as Sonator Wilson's successor are well known at tho National Capital, four of them having boen members of Congress, and all of these havo boon elected to tho 53d Congress. Tho names moat prominently mentioned aro Col. W. P. Hopburn, at present Solicitor of tho Treasury and member of Congress-elect from tho Eighth District; ITon. John T. Stone, At-tornoy-Gonoral of Iowa; Congressman Dollivor, of tho Ton th District; Congressman Perkins, of tho Eleventh District ; and last, but by no raean3 least, ox-Gov. John H. Gear, tho present Firat Assistant Secretary of tho Treasury Dopart ment, and member of Congro33-olcct from tho First District. Hon. James S. Clarkson, who helped run tho Republican campaign this Fall, is also montionod. Every one of these gontle mon would roprcsont tho Hawkoyo State in an ablo mannor, butnoarly all boliove that Gov. Gear has much tho be3t chance of securing the prizo, as he is perhaps the beat known of any of tho candidates mentioned, having served two tortus as Governor of tho State, and having brought the First District back into the Ec publican fold this year, overcoming a majority of nearly 2,590 votes. A comrade in tho Pension Bureau writes n3 that considerable excitement was occasioned in that offico on Tuesday, Deo. 6, by a happen ing of an un usual nature. Mr. George W. Arnold, an old veteran and pensionor, who lives at Woodbridgo, Va., and who draws his ponsion at the Washington agency, had boon in correspondence with Miss Cecelia Nein, of Cleveland, O., for the past year, had oschanged photographs, and had mot in Washington for tho purposo of joining their fortunes. Noithor had cvor beforo seen tho other, and they had appointed to moot at the fountain in the court of the Ponsion Office at a certain hour. Thoy mot, walked about tho court several times in conversation, and at last Comrade Arnold ap proached ono of tho messengers and asked where ho could find a minister to porform the marriage ceremony. Tho messenger took In tho situation and summoned Eov. W. II. Black, a clerk in tho Pension Bureau, and Comrado Arnold having already procured a marriage license, there wa3 little delay and tho ceremony was porformed. Tho messenger had dropped a hint in the meantime that something unusual wa3 about to occur, and consequently tho clerks rushod out of thoir room3 to tho balconies over looking tho court, and hundreds of them wero witnesses to the Btrango spectacle Later in the day Commissioner Eaum summoned the Eov. Mr. Black to lm prcsenco, and wanted to know why he had stirred up such a commotion in tho Bureau. When tho minister explained, the incidont was dismissed with a laugh. The happy couple immediately took a train for their Virginia home. It is vory astonishing what an immense amount of cheek tho averago office-seeker ex hibits. A short time ago a man wa3 on the point of striking tho Private Secretary of the Secretary of tho Treasury with a papor-weight because that official refused to devote his en tiro attention to forwarding the claims of the ofliceseokor. But tho oxperionco of Gen. Dan Macauloy, Appointment Clerk of the Treasury Department, is, if possible, still worse. About two wooks ago a woman entered his office, and said: "I havo come for a position, and I mean to have it. I shan't leave the building until I get it." "I regret to state that thero is no vacancy, madam," replied Gen. Macauley. "Then discharge somebody and make a va cancy," suggested tho visitor. "I can hardly do that," said the General. "Then I will stay hero and starve," declared tho woman. "All right, madam," assented the General. "Sit down and starve comfortably." But she would not accept tho invitation. Sho preferred to go to tho anteroom of tho Secre tary of tho Treasury, whoro sho drove tho offi cials nearly distracted. Finally they appealed to tho Appointment Clerk, and ho tried to per suade her to leave. "No," she insisted, "I prefer to starve right hero." "But, madam," protested Gen. Macauley, "you can Btarvo just as well in my room, and thoro is a pleasant cornor which you can have all to yourself." "I chooao to starve on this spot," responded tho woman, with emphasis. Sho has so far kept her word as to spend every day since then from 9 to 4 in the ante room, to tho great discomfort of tho clerks. a t Capt. I. N. Mudget, formerly of the 19th Mass., was iu tho city last wook taking iu the sight's, and viewing tho many points of interest at the National Capital, which he has not vis ited since tho close of the war. He saw much hard service during the war, and was taken prisoner at tho battle of Eeara's Station Aug. 25, 180 1, and suffered several months' imprison ment in the rebel starvation pens. Shortly after his muster-out ho emigrated to the then Territory of Washington, whoro ho has pros pered finely, and is now living at Snohomish City, engaged in an extensive shiugloand lum ber business with his sons. Ue speaks strongly of tho prospects of tho now Stato, aud thinks it is ono of tho favored portions of the earth. But, though it Is ono of tho best farming coun tries in tho world, it does not yet raise sufficient food for its own peoplo, and wheat sells thoro as high as two and a quarter cents a pound by the hundredweight. IIo tolls great stories of the wonderful forests of that region, which have fir and redwood trees 350 feet high and 125 fcot to tho first limb, with a diameter of 25 feet for tho base. The main difficulty in clear ing np a farm there is the difficulty of remov ing the stumps. Tho fir and redwood stumps seem practically indostructiblo by tho weather, and largo stumps, from which trees have been cut ovor 100 years, aro still as strong aud sound, apparently, as ever. Attempts to burn thorn out havo boon unsuccessful, and tho only way to romove them is to blast them with dynamite. Tho extent of tho stumpage is such that if all tho roots woro removed from tho ground thoy would covor tlA) surfaco to the dopth of four feet. A caso which created a gonuino sensation was heard in tho Supreme Court of tho District on Thursday, Dec. 8. Ilonriotta San ford, an or phan, was sent to the ITouse of tho Good Shep herd, a Catholic institution in Georgetown, under tho chargo of tho Sisters of Charity, when sho was 1G years old. That was oight years ago. Hor brother applied to Justice Bradloy on Thursday for a writ of habeas corpus, stating that his 3i'ster was detained against her will, and that he was never per mitted to see her without Bhe was in tho pres ence of ono of the sisters. Tho writ was issued, and tho girl, accompauied by tho Mothor Su perior, was brought to the court. The brother requested permission of Justice Bradley to talk in private with his sistor, and it wns givon. When the two started to goto the consultation room, the Mothor Superior also started to go with her charge, but was ordered by tho court to sit down. Whou tho proceedings on tho haboas corpus writ commenced, ono of iho lawyers asked Henrietta if sho preferred to romain in the Home, or to livo with her brother. Tho Mother Superior said something to the girl, and sho answered that she wa3 not dotained against hor will. Tho Iawyor thon told tho Jndgo it looked liko a caso of intimi dation, and he asked Judge Bradloy to ques tion the girl. Tho Judge took the girl into a room, and when ho returned he 3tatod that ho had questionod her, and that sho desired to leavo the Home and livo with hor brother's family; and as the institution bad no claim upon her, ho ordered her to bo discharged, saying that sho could go with her brother if sho so desired. Tho girl wont away with tho brother and lm wifo, and appeared to be quito happy. Sho is a daughter of a pensioner, who died not long ago leaving her some $00 pon sion money. MAJ.

Tho report of tho Fortification and Ord nanco Board, which was submitted to Congress on Tuesday, Dec. G, makes five important rec ommendations greater facilities and increased appropriations for testing and proving guns, mortars, otc; a Government gun aud mortar carriago factory, which can turn out mounts commensurate with tho production of guns and mortars; the early test and solection of an ac ceptable typo of disappearing carriage for eight inch nnd 10-inch guns; increased and immedi ate appropriations for the acquirement of site3 and construction of additional gun and mortar batteries ;.a constant supply of forging3 com mensurate with the output of the Army gun factory. The Board submits an estimate of an appro priation of $270,207 to make purchases, experi ments, and teats to ascertain the most effective guu3, small-arms, ammunitions, armor plates, etc. The Board recommends a repeal of the law pledging the United States to tho purchase of 50 cast-iron mortars, 50 10-inch, and 50 12 inch guns, on tho ground that cast-iron mortars can not compete with the steel, aud the 100 sea coast guns havo beon contracted for. More over, the report adds, tho Army gun factory is now competent to supply all demands. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. The Civil Service Commission, in its annual report, says that tho Presidential campaign just closed was the first in which it has actively in terfered to prevent the collection of political assessments, and it bolioves that its action had a most beneficial effect. "Public employes folt as thoy never before folt," the report says, " that they wero protected and neod not contribute unless they chose,.and thero was much less assessing dono than ever before, although it cannot bo doubted that, aa it was, altogether too much took place. In the opinion of tho Commission this practice will not bo wholly broken up nutil it is made a penal offense for any porson whatsoevor to solicit a political contribution from a Govorumcnt em ploye in any place whatsoever." Tho Commission recommends that the classi fied service bo oxtended as rapidly a3 practi cable to covor ovory place in tho public servico to which it can bo appropriately applied. Tho report is signed by Commissioners Lyman and Eoosevclt. Commissioner Johnson also ap proves the report, but does not concur in that part which refers to tho extension of the serv ico " to clerks aud writers in Navy-yards, to the officials of tho District of Columbia, to the Internal Eevenuo Service, to Custom Houses with 25 employes, and to free-delivery post offices." A RETALIATORY MEASURE. A bill was introduced in tho Sonato last week by Senator Fryo, of Maine, which smacks very strongly of retaliation, and at tho present time is of moro than usual interest.

Tho bill provides that the President may by proclamation 8U3pond the right of carrying merchandize in bond through tho United States provided for in tho bill in caso the Dominion of Canada should at any timo deprive the citi zens of tho United States of tho uso of tho canals in the Dominion on terms of equality with Canada ns provided by tho 27th Article of tha treat' of Washington.
