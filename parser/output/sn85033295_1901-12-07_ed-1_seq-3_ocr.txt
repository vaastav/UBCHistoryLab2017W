THE INSULAR CASES. i Important Decisions Handed Down by Supreme Court. Government Mnst Repay Unties ( ol lected on Imports from Philip* pines—Customs Levied Aaralnst Porto Rico Are Legal. Washington, Dec. 3.—Porto Rico and the Philippines became domestic terri tories immediately ttpon the ratifica tion of the treaty of peace. The con stitution followed the flag to all of the islands, and they immediately became territories of the United States. Duties levied in this country against the products of those islands under the Dingley law were illegal and must be returned, but merely because of the failure of congress to act. The islands never have been foreign since the treaty of peace. The power of congress to pass laws for the regulation of the territories is unrestricted. It comes from the con stitution itself. The Foraker act, providing civil gov ernment for Porto Rico, is constitu tional. The duties ix levied in the United States and in Porto Rico alike were legally collected because they were imposed by an act passed in pur suance of the constitutional right of congress to govern the territories as it sees fit. Alldutiescoilectedon goods between the United States and the Philippines under the Dingley tariff are illegal, be cause the Dingley tariff specifically fixes duties on goods coming from for eign countries, whereas the Philip pines are domestic. Congress Can Provide Tariff. The right of congress to legislate for the government of the Philippines is affirmed.and under that right a special tariff can be provided by congress at San Francisco and at Manila on goods going in either direction. The Philippines art in exactly the same condition as Porto Rico was just prior to the passage of the For aker act. As soon as congress legis lates for the Philippines those islands can have free trade or otherwise with the United States or with other coun tries, as congress sees fit. These general principles embody the sum and substance of the two im portant decisions handed down in the supreme court Monday. W ill Result in Legisla l lon, The immediate result of the decisions will be the passage of a law by con gress establishing a form of civil gov ernment, no matter how simple, for the Philippine islands, and establish ing tariffs on goods entering the is lands from the United States or else where. The same act will provide for the collection of taxes in the United States on the products of the Philip pines, and those will not be at the Ding ley rates, but at such rates as congress shall fix. The new law will be in its general principles the same as the tariff features of,the Foraker act, be cause it will provide and must pro vide under the ruling of the court that the taxes levied on goods brought from the Philippines shall be used for the government of these islands and shall not be turned into the treasury at all. Washington, Dec. 3. —Chief Justice Fuller on Monday announced that aft er the session of the court on Mon day next a recess would be taken for four weeks, the court reconvening on January 6.

DISCUSSED BY CABINET. Decision)* of Supreme Court in In sular Cases Quite Satisfactory to Government. Washington, Dec. 4. —The cabinet meeting Tuesday was principally con sumed in a discussion of the insular decisions handed down Monday by the supreme court. On the whole it is believed the views of the majority of the court were quite satisfactory to the administration. It was pointed out that the ultimate results of the decisions are in a measure speculative at present with the exception that the customs duties collected in this country on goods slfipped from the Philippines since the ratification of the Paris treaty will have to be refunded. It is not thought, however, that the aggregate will be large and Secretary' Gage expects that it will be within $1,000,000. He called attention to the fact that the great bulk of the im ports from the Philippines were acT mitted free of duty under our gen eral tariff laws, notably hemp, which is one of the leading staples of the islands. "’he present tariff laws now in op eration in the Philippines, Mr. Gage thinks, will need little or no revision. It was prepared after the most thor ough and intelligent investigation and is said to be highly' satisfactory to the business interests of the is lands. The preparation of a tariff on Philippine importations into the Unit ed States, however, is expected to con-\ siime considerable of the time of con gress. but there is expectation that, pending a final settlement of the ques tion, congress by joint resolution may' continue 1 the duties imposed by the Dingley tariff and thus, if it is so dis posed, cut off a flood of imports which might follow the announcement that all duties were removed. Manila. Dec. 4. —Tim local newspa pers published extras on the news of the United States supreme court’s de cision that the Philippines were American territory' and that the im position of duty on articles imported into the United States from the Phil ippines is improper. The decision caused jubilation among the mer chants and the general public. Repre sentatives of the principal business houses say' it will revolutionize the entire trade of the orient. Civil au thorities believe the law applies only to goods going to the United States, and are anxiously awaiting an official communication, since, if the decision holds here, new means for obtaining funds to run the government will be necessary'. Gen. Luke Wright, the vice governor, thinks a general revi sion of taxation is imperative. 

DESPERATE DOOMED MAN. Murderer Awaiting Execution In Jail at Mount Holly, X. J., Mates Dash for Liberty. Mount Holly, N. J., Dec. 4. —Charles Brown made a desperate attempt to break jail a short t:me before the hour set for his execution Tuesday morning. As his spiritual adviser, Rev. J. C. Diesinger, of Camden, was leaving the cell, in compliance with a wish of the prisoner that he be left alone half an hour to prepare himself for death. Brown suddenly rushed from his cell armed with a piece of lead pipe, which he brandished at the guards. Surprised by the suddenness of the attack the guards fell back. Brown dashed down the corridor, sprang down a short flight of steps and had reached the kitchen. He waved aside guards who were following him, jumped through a window and reached the yard, where he armed himself with an ax. One of the deputies who ap proached the desperate man was struck on the arm with a piece of pipe, but others closed in cm Brown and overpowered him. He was manacled and placed in his cell to await execu tion. At 10:05:30 he was hanged. He walked to the scaffold without betray ing the slightest fear and had calmed down completely after his desperate attempt to escape from jail. Death was almost instantaneous.

Criticism on the Whole Is Rather Fa vorable—Position on the Canal Question Not Regarded as Cause for Apprehension. London, Dee. 4. —The London daily papers, looking at President Roose velt’s message from the point of view of its literary power and the wealth of weighty- matters discussed, regard it as one of the most characteristic and remarkable messages ever sent to con gress. At the same time the papers recognize its conservative and busi nesslike moderation and that no at tempt has been made, as the Morning Post remarks, “to strike an attitude or carry- his listeners away-.” Somewhat Skeptical. On the whole, however, thA news papers are skeptical of any great out come from the president’s efforts in the direction of reform of the trusts, anti-anarchism or reciprocity, the idea being that the senate will effectually step in and prevent any great changes in the existing sy-stem. Most of the papers remark upon the tone of exultation adopted by Presi dent Roosevelt in dealing with the canal question, but they do not show the slightest disposition to cavil thereat. The Daily Telegraph says it would have been an inconceivably disastrous blunder to have opposed America’s wishes in this matter and thus driven her to build a still greater fleet than she already contemplated, which, it is safe to predict,will 20 years hence make the United States the second sea power in the world. The Telegraph thinks that President Roosevelt’s policy- is calculated rather to diminish than to increase Europe’s exaggerated dread of “the American danger.” No Cause for Apprehension. The Standard is similarly of the opinion that nothing in the message need in the smallest degree excite anx iety or apprehension abroad. This pa per comments upon the president’s un compromising assertion of the Monroe doctrine as somewhat unnecessary, in asmuch as there is little desire on the part of any- foreign power to extend its area of militarism to the new world. Regarding President Roosevelt’s spirited enunciation of Monroeism, the Chronicle says: “Whether the European nations are likely- to re spect this American prohibition much longer, when the desirable colonizing grounds of the world are being snapped up in a headlong race, must depend ultimately- upon the ability- of the United States to en force their prohibition.” The “Thunderer’s” Views. The Times in an editorial on the message says it is distinguished by a clearness, firmness and reserved strength which do not require the adventitious aid of rhetorical pyro technics or popular platitudes. “We certainly have no fatilt to find,” say-s the Times, “with his language to wards the British government, or in deed with his foreign policy general ly. It is not easy to see how the ex clusion policy can be enforced. The United States would to-day be poor er in many of the finer elements of its national character if an entrance fee had been demanded of every set tler in the early day-s of coloniza tion.” The Times thinks that re ciprocity- and the trusts will prove thorny- problems. In Germany. Berlin, Dec. 4. —The message of Pres ident Roosevelt caused a mild thrill in Germany. On the boerse, where it was eagerly awaited, the message was re ceived with uncommon interest and the market generally- was slightly stimulated upon the posting of a bul letin containing President Roosevelt’s utterances about trusts. The shares of the steamship companies fell one or two points on account of the immi gration inspection paragraph and the proposed development of the merchant marine. President Roosevelt’s words concern ing the restriction of immigration con tain an unpleasant suggestion in the present state of depression, when, as the Berliner Yolks Zeitung says, the hard times make an overflow of the laboring population of Europe neces sary-. The free trade and liberal newspapers welcome the reciprocity recommendations, but regret that President Roosevelt did not recom mend a specific tariff reduction. The first impression of the presi dent’s message in German official cir cles is that the repression of an archists by international agreement is much more likely to be carried through upon the initiative of the United States than by that of any- other power. An anti-anarchist proposition from Ger many- along the same lines as that of President Roosevelt is probably al ready on its way to the state depart ment at Washington. Taking the message altogether, it Iras been favorably received both pop ularly and officially-. The references it contains to the late Empress Fred erick are especially appreciated. Bookkeeper Got Small Port. New York, Dec. 4. —According to the London correspondent of the World Thomas P. Goudie, the book keeper who has just been arrested on the charge of defrauding the Bank of Liverpool of at least $85,000 by- means of forged checks, secured only $14,- 500 as his share of the proceeds. Rig Car Ferry Steamer. Cleveland, 0., Dec. 4. —The Pere Mar quette Railway company has ordered from the American Shipbuilding com pany a car ferry steamer at a cost of $400,000.

Havana, Dee. 4.—A cablegram signed by Eusebio Hernandez, presi dent of the democratic party, has been sent to Secretary of War Root. This message says: “The friends of Gen. Bartolome Maso hear with great satisfaction your declara tion that official Interference in the com ing elections will not be tolerated, but un der the present arrangements interference is inevitable, as all members of the cen tral canvassing board are candidates for office and are also members of the execu tive committee of Senor Tomas Estrada Palma.

Eusebio Hernandez also rep resents the coalition of the national and independent republicans. The lower classes are enthusiastic over the candidacy of Gen. Maso.
