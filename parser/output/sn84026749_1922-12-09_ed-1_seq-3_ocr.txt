At Least One Year Will Elapse Before Definite Action la Taken. By OEOROE R. HOLMES, (tnesraattsaal New. Servtee.) The sentence of death ha? bean passed on the Railway Labor Board. that It appeared certain today there wUl be ft stay of execution tor at 'eaat a year. Republican leaders of all shades of opinion In Congress ?greed today with President Harding that the storm-tossed board, ?a at present constituted, has outlived Its useful ness. But ths method by which the ex?cution will be carried out was ? matter of considerable discussion and divergent views. A careful survey of the existing ?ttufttlon in Congress disclosed to Administration leaders that there le hut alight hope of carrying out be tween now and March 4 more than a amali part of the far-reaching recom mendntiona made by President Hard ing in his 'message. Senate Jam Blocks Action. The House, under pr?teurs, could accomplish the major part of Presi dent Hardlng'a program, but'it would avail nothing because of the log Jam In the Senate. Next week the Senate becomes embroiled In the fight over the Herding-Lasker ship subsidy bin. The result Is In doubt, with ? tew wavering votes holding ?the fate of the bill. But the fighting It certain to be prolonged and bitter. Senate leaders privately expressed the opinion today tnat If the Senate could be whipped into passing the ship subsidy bill and the ten big eupply bills In the ten working weeks' that remain before March 4, they would be well sattofled. If the President's program la to be carried out. therefore, it would apparently necessitate an ex?-a ses sion of the new Sixty-elghTn Con great, with Ha reduced Republican majorities. Immediately after the ex piration of the .Sixty-seventh on March 4. Avete? to Extra Session. President Harding Is not in favor Of ?n extra session next summer. He has expressed himself emphati cally on this point, saying he believed the country waa tired of Congress and was deserving of ? good long rest. Nevertheless, th? President's mes sage will be made the vehicle for a aew drive for an extra session. Sena tor Lafoilette of Wisconsin ?nd his so-called "progressive" lieutenants from the grain belt, will conduct the drive. They will insist, they said today, that the urgent need for ac tion In the railroad and agricultural "?situations necessitate an extra ses sion, ?nd they will quote from the President's message to back up their argument. Farm ? Id Possible. It ?nay be possible. Administra tion leaders said today, to carry out in the neat tee weeks portions of ths President's program dealing With agricultural relief, through extension of farm credit?, and also the consti tutional amendment prohibiting child tabor. The opposition to these parte of his program Is insignificant. No attempt, however, will prob ably be mad? to open up the rail' road situation. Senator Cummins of Iowa, author of ths transportation act, seid today he would introduce no legislation In the present session to abolish the Labor Board. "We can't get any action on such ateista tlrrri at this session, why in troduce ItT" asked Cummins. Ones th? railroad eltuatlon 1? opened up la the senate, some lively flgbtln? to certain. La Follette, Brookhart. Norrto, Lsdd. Capper and other Of the so-called Progres sive group are merely biding their ( time ?nd waiUng Cor an opportunity t? tear ths Esch Cummins bill to ?bred?. _
