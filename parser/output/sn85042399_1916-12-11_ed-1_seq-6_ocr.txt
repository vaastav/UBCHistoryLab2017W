While Rob - e r t P a u 1 o f London was interesting Sir Augustus Har- ris in his mo- 1 1 o n picture device and r.r thereby g e t ting it launch ed, more than half blind to Its larger and ever ex panding possibilities as an amuse ment enterprise in England, a num ber of astute showmen iu Pails, but all of them far less prominent in their day than Harris, were awaken- ing to some faint surmise of the pos- sibilities wrapped up in Lumiere in- volitions. Many of these were what we would term iu this country penny arcade proprietors. They were about the "smallest fry" In tlfo whole amusement realm. However, It has taken but history to prove that all they were lacking was the larger op portunity, j It is a significant fact that, when the opportunity did come in motion pictures. It was these same "small fry" that appreciated and took ad- vantage of it more readily than the aristocrats of the amusement world, ' who then flaunted their greater pros-1 ferity and prominence as a sigu of superior wisdom. j If the showmen of Paris in 1S9G were asked to choose the man who would be greatest among thepi twen- ty years thence, probably one of the last names that would have entered . their minds is that of Charlie Pathe. The more prominent of them would have considered his a "piker's" busi ness. Ho operated the kinetoscopes. He had started with one, then in creased to three. Finally he was op erating in eighteen different cities in France. As a film outlived Its interest In one locality, Pathe would move it on to another and bring in a film from still another locality to take the place of the one that had gone. In this manner he kept his pictures in constant circulation,, making each one do service In eighteen different towns. And here was horn an idea that has developed Into one of the dominating factors of the motion pic ture Industry as it Is regulated today. It was the beginnings of the modern film exchange, of which 1 will speak further In a coming chapter. When the Lumiores had perfected their projecting device, Pathe was among the first to appreciate the In creased scope that It gave the fitm industry. Despite his ingenuity in handling his kinetoscope, returns had been niggardly and slow in coming. 1 He had accumulated barely enough . to buy a motion picture camera, but, I with the spirit that has dominated the remarkable growth of the pic ture business, he made the invest- You Should Know "Guessing is good only when it hits."

He shaved his personal living expense to the quick to get the few extra cents necessary to purchasing raw film stock. He had no certainty of market, being under the necessity of pioneering an unexplored field. It was a disheartening task, but one that he held unflinchingly to. His subjects were primlntlve a man running, chickens feeding, cat- tie grazing, and the like. The mov- ing spirit behind motion pictures was still curlodty the marvel of seeing the subjects in motion on the screen, These first Pathe films were of short length ten, twelve and fifteen feet 'perhaps but they were the embryo of something In the making some- thing tremendously tlonary even. great revolu- I During those early days Pathe was his own cameraman, shipping clerk, manufacturer, demonstrator and salesman.
