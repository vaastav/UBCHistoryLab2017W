When complaint was made about a ilozon years ago against "the billion ilollar Congress," Speaker. Thomas B. Reed replied pithily that tho United States ought to spend this much money because It had become "a billion dollar country." Tho Unit ed States Is still a billion dollar coun. try. SInco Mr. Reed's day it has had to meet tho problems of the Spanish war, tho building of a navy, and tho many other duties and responsibili ties requiring enormous expenditures. Tho revenues increased with tho ex penditures but it required cool heads In Congress to prevent extravagance and waste of public funds. It is most gratifying to noto that an effort is now being made to or ganizo tho fiscal responsibilities of the executive and legislative branch es of tho government. Members of both pnrtles in Congress are co-operating to this end and they have tho hearty support of President Taft and Secretary MacVoagh of the Treasury Department. Tho Senate has appoint ed a Committee on Expenditures, in cluding' tho chairman of tho separate committees having charge of appro priation bills, with a view of binding together the work of these commit tees, and of hnving It all pnssed upon together and in common, thus tend ing toward' making tho appropriation of Congress one appropriation in stead of many. Instead of each mem ber of the Cabinet sending to Con gress tho estimates of his own de partment without any common consid eration of the estimates of the wholo Cabinet, the future practice will bo to have the estimates of all depart ments reported to tho President and his Cabinet for consideration with a view to a relationship to the expected revenue. It) goes without saying that there Is abundance of room for economy in national expenditures. Two) or three years may be required to work out a complete plan. One of the most Bkilled expert accountants in the United States has begun a com prehensive Investigation to enable the executive and legislative branch es to unite in a plan for the perman ent reduction of tho cost of govern mental administration. This is a pru dent business policy which is entit led to the endorsement of men of all political parties. "Wo are a billion dollar country but oven a rich' nation has no business spending more than its income. Persons who arc disposed to com plain about tho high cost of living In tho United States may take some comfort Ini tho fact that they could not improvo their condition by trans ferring their citizenship to somo oth er nation. A report has just been received from the American consul at Nanking that the increasing cost of living in China is a matter of grave concern to missionaries . Ho says that every item of household ex pense is included In the rapid ad vance in prices. The increased cost of living in China compels foreigners to pay twice as much ront for their houses and 150 por cent moro for rico than they paid ten years ago. If this increase continues it ia pos sible tho American Chinese may bo content to remain in tho United States instead of returning to tho land of their forefathers when tho laundry has yielded a competence for old ago. Did you 'ever notlco a herd of cat tle In a Held whore ono or two of them spond half tho day with their heads over tho fence bellowing be causo thoy can't get over into tho next field, and all tho timo tho rest of tho herd aro picking up a living in tho fence corners?

CLOTHES TPIMIAMrit& NINO The New Stadium is an overcoat ot unusual snap py design. It's meant, pri- manly, lor young men, but IS conservative enough to be worn by those ol mature years. Come in and ask to see it. We won't ask how old you are. Now is the the time to buy yovr winter outfit. Assort ment is at its best. Tho editors of country newspapers aro sometimes unjustly criticised for not censuring public ofllcials who are possibly lax in their duties, or cer tain enterprises not always condu cive to tho best interests of the pub lic, and many othor things that might bo brought to public notice by tho press, but did tho readers over stop to think that the nowspaper business in small towns is a privato business upon which the editors and employes depend for a living, and that caution is necessary to protect his business the samo as that of any other busi ness man. Tho editor may bo of tho opinion personally that certain things aro not for tho best but to publicly expose it would bring disaster upon himself, just tho samo as a grocer reasons that he cannot call down a' farmer who brings him poor butter or stole eggs, because if he does -ho loses his trado and possible through the influence of tho "abused" farm er, many of tho farmer's friends. Tho way to look at these things is, aro you willing to do tho writing and slgm your own namo to it? There Is no part of President Taft's message moro gratifying than that in which ho says that no ono Is seeking a tariff war or a condition in which the spirit of retaliation shall bo aroused. It is apparent that the President Intends to avail himself of tho wide discretion granted to him in tho tariff act and that in construing tho words "unduly discriminatory" ho will not bo guided by party con siderations. Ho expresses tho hope and belief that no tariff war will be necessary, lmenuiy negotiations win bo ontored into for the purpose of securing for tho products of tho Unit ed States equal treatmont In tho mar kets of tho world. A trade war with Canada or with any of tho great na tions of Europe would bo most dis astrous to American commerce, and business men without regard to party, will stand back of tho President in his determination to avoid the neces sity of such display of comraorcinl strongth.

WHEN 8NOW WAS 40 FEET DEEP. Took GOO Soldiers to Clear the Way Ir the English Blizzard of 1830. ! Tho mogul engines which wo stalled In tho recent blizzard out wesl do "not appear to bo worthy uucccssori of a certain Hercules onglno which cul n noblo flguro in tho English blizzard of 183C. To appreciate tho role played by th Hercules some idea must bo givon ol tho effect of tho storm on othor meth ods of travel. Fourteen mail coachcj were abandoned on as many ronda Another wns dug out of drifts five times between Exeter and London. Anothor was burled so deep that it took 300 men, principally sappers and minors, soveral hours to mako a pas. sago to tho coach and rcscuo the mails and passengers, whllo near Chatham tho snpw lay to a depth of 30 or 40 feet tho military being turned out to the unmber of COO to clear tho wav. . In London the drifts were ten feel deep and hundreds of men and enrts wero employed hauling snow out to the neius in the suburbs. Tho markets woro in a bad way. Ono day only foui stall holders were able to reach a main market. Greens which a few days be fore tho storm were being sold foi threo pence a bunch at market, now fetched from ten pence to ono shilling, turnips, carrots and celery becoming equally dear; while one penny handfuls of parsley realized two shillings six pence, and the happy possessor of 0 uuuuii wmca no nau previously pur- ennseu lor nmepenco realized for his prize no less a sum than 1 2s 3d Amid all this confusion tho pioneer 1 railways covered themselves with glory j by running trains almost without inter-! ruption.

Rear .mincemeat, hide, hair and spots of blood near Wortraan's .road house mark the place where a careless bear rolled down the hillside Into a bunch of steers being driven over tho trail from Valdez to Fairbanks. The fight took place where the trail runs along the foot of a steep bluff. It is not certain what m: de the bear come 4dovn. He either lost his footing while rubbering at tne neru or took a run ning jump to stampede the bunch In the hope of biting off a porterhouse steak. I either event his calcula tions wero wrong, for those 35 steers fell upon him like two-and-twenty foot ball players upon the ball. In less than a' minute the cowpunche'rs couldn't see what was going on, ex cept that there was trouble. Then the scent of butchered bear assailed the breezes and those 3a hys terical steers stampeded in all ways at once, and it took the punchers half a day to gather them together again. The bear will never get together again in this world. He is supposed to be dead. N Sure Death to Germs, Liberal use of plain old-fashioned whitewash Is urged in a bulletin Is sued by the Chicago sanitary bureau. Inspectors of workshops and tene ments are ordered to insist upon the use of "limowash" in dark basements and workshops. Besides aiding mats rially to light the premises, it is de clared an important aid In fighting tu berculosis. "When made of only 70 grains of lime and five grains of salt to a gallon of water it has a proved power," the bulletin says, "of killing germs on dry surfaces. When used on such surfaces it possesses both a chemical "and mechanical action, kill ing germs and bacteria by the first and sealing them In by Uie other." te. . rnftMa lit hilt-ilUr Winter WheatFlour U,Nothlng is quite so distress ing to the housewife as a baking ruined coarse, doughy bread; leaden bis cuits; tough pie crust that refuses to brown nicely.

Puller's FORT IN AN OLD VOLCANO Extinct Crater of Diamond Head, at Honolulu, Is Center of Govern ment Operations. The United States army is fortify ing the city or Honolulu, Hawaii, and tho extinct crater of the great Dia mond Head volcano Is tho center of tho operations. This crater lies to the east of tho city, and Its bowl, somo 20 acres In area, is inclosed by abrupt cliffs from GO to 200 feot in height. Through this rim of cliffs, on tho sldo farthere8t from tho ocean, our army engineers aro boring two large tun nels which lead from tho great 12-inch mortar batteries on the outer slopo to tho great cavity within the old vol cano. Inside tho mountain will be con structed ammunition magazines, which should be exceptionally secure from tho chance of explosion. Erosion has deposited a layer of about six feet of earth over tho floor of the crater, while a small lako forms at ono sldo during tho greater part of tho year. Probably barracks for troops will bo built in this inclosure and a garden to furnish an adoquato supply of vege tables for tho soldlerB might easily bo planted Jn tho fertile soil. The strongth of this novel Bchomo of fortifications may bo recognized when wo realizo that tho Dla mon Head stands botwoon tho batter ies and tho sea and would render of fectlvo battlo-shlp flro in an attack al most impossible. Slnco tho mortars simply drop their sholls upon tho ob Ject of attack tho nocesslty of firing ovor tho mountain does not interfere in tho slightest wjth tholr accuruoy. Electric Indicators situated nt some sultablo point or observation will di rect tho aiming of tho mortars. Hnr nor's Weekly.

A soldier nt Ahleryhot, not having had much time in which to dress Tor yarade. contained himself by only cleaning the Trent of his boots. Ono of his churns, noticing this, said: "Why don't you clean the back of your boots, Ben?" "A good Eold'er never looks be hind," hu replied. As a result of his carelessness the adjutant awarded Ben three extra pa rades. A few days afterward his chum again remarked: "I thought a good soldier never looked behind, Ben?" "No," said Ben, "but the adjutant did." When the preacher said. "Behold the perfect man!" every male mem ber of the congregation became cross eyed with looking at himself.
