The situation with regard to Presi dent Castro is somewhat anomalous. The Spanish government has. not been ofliciallj' advised from Caracas that tho president is visiting Spain and un der the impression that ho will onl3T touch here enrouto to Bordeaux, has instructed tho local authorities to ron der kim-militar' and civil port honors.

PRESIDENT QUICK TO SEND SPECIAL MESSAGE WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. An emergency volunteer army measure was advocated today by President Roosevelt in a special message sent to congress and t.he draft of the bill accompanying the measure was introduced In the senate by Mr. Cullom. Tho president says tho bill is Intended to replace the present law, which was placod on the statute books' "piecemeal and hurriedly, partly on tho eve of tho war wltli Spain and partly after hostili ties had actually commenced." After declaring the present law to bo faulty and wholly lnadcquato to a speedy und proper organization of a volunteer force, tho president says the bill pro posed, which was drawn under super vision of the chief of staff of the army, has tho hearty approval of tho war de partment. Tho message says further: "It Is designed to afford tho comploto .machinery by which, should wo bo con fronted with n foreign war, tho exocutlvo power could procood at once lo transform enthusiastic ' and patriotic citizens Into efficient and organized soldiers. Happily there Is at present no cloud upon our horizon, but that very fnc.t uffords us tho best opportunity to proceed with delibera tion and care in the preparation of laws adequate nnd Indispensable for our .possi ble war need!." It Is pointed out by the president that the proposed measure would not call for I a dollar's expenditure during the years of peace and Us enactment into law now "would merely be to place ut tho disposal of the executive power machinery where by, should war threaten, the means to wage It could be swiftly brought into be ing." The proponed hill Is clastic; under Its provisions a force of -',000,000 men could be raised, as well as one of 50.000. Empire Theater Special. Living pictures, "Indian Maiden," "Prcscilla."

Tilford, president of tho Standard Oil company of California, was taken up today whero it was left oil last night, in "the hearing of the government suit for the dissolution of tlio Standard Oil companj' of New Jcr sov. Mr. Tilford had taken with him last night a copy of the contract between tho Union Oil company and the Pacific Coast Oil company, which contract Mr. Kellogg, the government's counsel, had insisted provided for a purchase of 150,- 000 barrels of oil monthly from the Union by tho Pacific Coast Oil company. Tho witness told Mr. Kellogg today that he had examined the copy, but could not swear it was correct, because he had never scon tho original, which had been destroyed in the liro following the San Francisco earthquake, but he pointed out that the copy given to him iast night provided for tho purchaso of the given quantity of oil every three months, aud not every month, as Mr. Kellogg had stated tho original did. On a roporusal of the document Mr. Kellogg admitted his mistake. Mr. Tilford tcstined that tho total production of crude oil in California in 1S95 was '10.000,000 barrels, of which amount the Standard produced 9,000,000 barrels. lie said one-half of it was used as fuel by manufacturing concerns and railways "of the country. Mr. Kellogg asiced if the Standard Oil company of California did not sell 9G per ceni of all the refined oil consumed iu the Pacific coast states, but tho wit ness did not think the percentage was quite so high. "You had- 14,000,000 barrels in sloratro iu 1005, had you not?" asked Mr. Kellogg, "1 think so," replied the witness, who ihen eaid the prices paid for the stored oil ranged from 1G to S5 cents per barrel. "Isn't it a fact that you did not pav moro than 20 cents a barrel for this oil on an average?" "Yes, for tho fuel crudo oil, that is true, but for rofinablo crudo we paid higher." Asked if competitors of the Standard I were not selling a relincd oil in Cali fornia, Mr. Tiltord replied that refined l oil was sold by the Union Oil companj-, a, competitor. He said, however, that retailers bought oil from both the Standard Oil company of California and the Union Oil company and mixed them in their tanks beforo selling tho illumi nating oil. This completed Mr. Tilford 's examination.

PROPOSE AMENDMENTS TO HEPBURN RATE LAW WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. Sovoral importaut amendments to the Hepburn railroad rate law were proposed in bills introduced today by Rcprosontativo Townsend of "Michigan, ono of tho most activo advocates of tho lato re medial legislation aloug state com merce lines. Ono of tho bills gives to tho inter state commerce commission tho power to prohibit tho taking on of an ad vance in rates in cases in which ship pers individuallj or collectively pro test against the advanco prior to tho oxpiration of tho legal thirty days' notice. The bill places tho burden on tho carriers to show at subsequent hearings on the proposed rates that tho in creased rates are just and reasonable. Representative Townsend will also f;ivo tho shipper the right and privi ege of routing and prescribing tho connecting lines a shipment shall take. He would havo tho law declare that in rCase the shipper designates no route, the lowest published rate between the points of origin and of destination should apply. Another amondmont provides that tho carriers shall quote j rates in writing upon application and givo the rates upon bills of lading and that the rates be reckoned thereon. In the event that error is made in theso rates it is provided that claims for re covery shall be made only through the interstate commerce commission. The price is way down on uncalled for suits.

INCREASE IN NAVY SEEMS NOT LIKELY WASHINGTON, Dec. S. While the houso committee on naval affairs has not given formal consideration to the proposed increase in tho navy, it was learned toda.y that the members of the committee stand practically tho same as last winter, when au authorization for two battleships was made. That the committee will voto down tho prop osition of President Roosevelt for four battleships is now indicated. Tho attitude of tho loaders in the senate declaring for an appropriation for two battleships annually is eaid to appeal to many members of the house, and a majority of tho member ship is willing to have such a policy approved in the house. It is said that the naval committee will vote down tho suggestion from tho navy department for an appropriation for cruisers, but that it will grant tho request for a number of colliers.
