W r e copy the following from the St. Louis Times: The season for the closing of the upper Mississippi is fast approaching, and mer chants—unless this proves an unusually mild winter—will have to rely mainly upon railroads for their transportation South, as well as to the East. The Mississippi, as is well known, is closed for all practical pur poses from hero out to Cairo, two to tkreo months every winter, thus placing an em bargo upon our Southern trade in grain and produce, the very season when extra freight facilities aro most needed. The grain trade, it maybe said, is espe cially affected by this annua! blockade, and froni December i to February 1 all trade in cereals languishes, and these accumulate here simply for the want of liberal trans portation facilities hence to the seaboard. Now, if floating grain elevators be es tablished to run between East St. Louis aud the Iron Mountain railroad, and at Belmont, from which barges could be loaded without trouble throughout the winter, this difficulty would be partially removed. If also, one of these elevators be established at Cairo in connection with the Cairo Short Line, thus enabling that road to ship bulk grain from here through to New Orleans by connection with boats at Cairo, another difficulty would be over come. The Iron Mountain and Cairo Short Line should also increase their number of bulk gfaiu cars, and with these facilities a heavy grain trade might be done through this channel, not only with New Orleans, but with the leading Eastern and European markets. Would it not be well for the proprietors ol our elevators to look into this matter f We are told bv knowing ones that tioatirig elevators could lie built at a moderate cost, say $10,000, and in a very short time. But if they are not willing to make this outlay, there "is but little doubt that arrange ments could be made with Messrs. J L. Higby 8c Co., of New Orleans, who wo learn have several of these elevators. At all events some effort should be made to create u:i outlet for our grain from here to New Orleans. There are now forty ocean steamers plying between that poiut and European ports, which, in connection with the cheap water transportation thence to New York and New England points, the " Crescent City " should be made a large grain market. Order of Congressional Business. A Washington special to the St. Louis Republican says : The calendar of the order of business of tho House was furnished to-day, and will be ready for. Congress on Monday next, which will be the first day of the session. There are thirteen reports of committees—that is bills reported by committees undisposed of —wliirii include the bill of Mr. Monroe, of Ohio, to provide for the retirement ot worn and mutilated national bank notes, and the bill of Mr. Hawley of Illinois to secure the public lands to actual settlers. On this bill there was quite a contest. The bill reached a decisive vote, but before it was taken the motion was reconsidered. It will be the first business before the House. The bill of Scofield, of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Naval Committee, to au thorize the construction of ten or more steam vessels of war, will be among the first considered. There are eighteen bills on the Speaker's table, which have been passed by the Sen ate and reported favorably by the proper committee of the House. Tbe first ot these is an act to prevent cruelty to animals while in transit by railroad or other means of transportation within tbe United States. Sevoral others are what are termed private bills. The fifth on the list is an act authorizing mail steamship service in the Gulf of Mex ico from Now Orleans. There are two bills to amend the enforcement act. wliieh will cot be pressed, since they were intended for effect dilring the presidential election, and several relating to homesteads. The seventeenth on the Speaker's table is an act to authorize inquiries into tbe cause of steam boiler explosions, and the last is to encour age tiie growth, of timber on Western prairies. This is au unusually small num ber of bills on tbe Speaker's table for tbe closing session of a Congress. Two years ago there were seventy, among which there were so many jobs and schemes for plunder ing the treasury in steamship subsidies, etc., that the House refused to go to work on tbe Speaker's table until nearly the close of the session, when a single objection un der a special rule carried the Dills over. Among the present bills there is but one subsidy job— that of the new ocean steam ship. A Washington dispatch of Thursday says: A Pennsylvania Democrat yesterday visited the White House and was intro duced to the President by a prominent Pennsylvania Republican. During the in terview the Democrat told the President that, curious as it might seem, he voted for him iu preference to Greeley. He also re miuded the President that he had voted for Buchanan. Tbe President said, drily, "It was true he did vote for Buchanan, with a protest. Thinking ho saw the rebellion looming up in the future, he voted for Bu chanan against Fremont, whom lie regard ed as untiled for the emergency.'' This is a sporting item from the More house Conservative: On da.v lasf week, near the Bingham place, on Oak Ridge, Dick Wright, while riding along the road under the induence of whisky, met a party of colored men and concluded to make a display of his skill at shooting. So he presented his pistol at the erowd and fired. The shot took effect upon Nathan McWoodson, killing him instantly. The accused was arrested and brought be fore the parish judge and conjmitted to jail.
