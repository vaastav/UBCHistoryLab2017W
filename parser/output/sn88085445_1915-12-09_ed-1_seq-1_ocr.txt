FOLLOWING is the message oi President Wilson delivered nt B Joint session of the seimte and bouse at the beginning of the Sixty-fourth congress; Gentlemen of the Congress—Sluce i Inst hud the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union the wui jof nations on the other side of the sen which had then only begun to disclose Its portentous proportions, has extend ed its threateniug utid sinister scope until it has swept within its tiatiic some portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own betnl sphere, has altered the whole face ot International uilairs, uud now presents a prospect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen anil I peoples have never been culled ui«oi !to attempt before. The president tells how this country practiced neutrality and declares thul he hopes thut when the time couic for readjustment and recuperation thi.- country will be of Infinite service. Re f erring to Central and South American problems, the president declares thai we should retain unabated the spirit which has Inspired us throughout the whole life of our government uud which was so frankly put Into words by President Monroe. We have been put to the test In the case of Mexico, aud we have stood the test Whether we have benefited Me\ ico by the course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes ure In her own hands. But we have ut leas, proved that we will not take advan tage of her In her distress and under take to impose upon her an order and government of our owu choosing. Lib erty Is often a tierce and intractable thing, to which no bounds can be sei and to which no Inuinds of a few men's choosing ought ever to be set |SVery American who has drunk at the true fountains of principle aud tru ditlon must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Vlr glnlu bill of rights, which in the grea; days In which our government was so up was everywhere among us accept eel as the creed of free men. That doc trine Is, "That government Is or ottshl to be Instituted for the common Line fit. protection nnd security of the ueu pie. nation or community;" that "ol all the various modes nnd forms of government, that is the best which is capable of producing the greatest de gree of happiness uud safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, and thai when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to tltese pur (Kjses a majority of the community hath an Indubitable, iuallenuble and Indefeasible right to reform, alter 01 alx/.ish It iv such inutiuci us shall be Judged most conducive to the public weal." We have unh v*itu tliigly ap piled that heroic principle to the cuse of Mexico nnd now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which bad so much of which to purge Itself and so little sympathy from uny outside quarter in the radical but nee essary process. We will aid and be friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her. and our course with regard to ber ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer- Hm Tribune print* Unlay a •ummary of the President's message because it believes every citizen should read it.

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIPE'S SPIRIT. Economic Adjustment* Inevitable With in the Next Generation. The mural Is that the states of Amer ica nre not hostile rlvuls, but co-op erating friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of Interest, alike in matters political uud la mat ters economic, is likely to give them a uew Significance us factors lv interna tional affairs uud In the political bis lory of the world. It presents them a* In a very deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking to gether. quick with common sympathies and common Ideals. Separated, they ure subject to all the cross currents of the confused politics of a world of bos tile rivalries; united in spirit mid pur pose, they cannot he disappointed ot their peaceful destiny. This Is pan-Americanism. It has none of tbe spirit of empire in it. It is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and Independence ami liberty and mutual service. The president cnlls attention to the meeting in Washington recently of representatives of the pan-American republics and says that economic ad justment Is Inevitable in the next gen eration. No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people foe whom we are appointed to speak can fail to per ceive that their passion Is for peace, their genius heel displayed in the pmc tlce of the arts of peace.

The last one will stand at the corner of Fourth and will be erected for Mr and Mrs. William McDonnell. Declares That if Full Navy Pro gram Is Carried Out We Will Have a Fleet For Defense That Will Be to Our Needs and Worthy of Our Traditions." Greatest Danger to Country Comes From Within Our Bor ders. enthusiasm for Individual liberty and free national development to the lad dents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wher ever there is a people that tries to walk in these difficult paths of Independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed It as important that our neigh bors should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should he; have set America aside as a whole for the uses of independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a peo pie against aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta torial power within our own nation as of aggression from without. We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary in times of peace as In times of war. SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. Increase Standing Regular Force—Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers. Cut war hus never been a mere mat ter of men and guns. It Is a tiling of disciplined might. If our citizens are ever to light effectively upon v sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately avail able and Immediately effective. And tbe government must bo their servant in this matter, must supply them with the truinlng they need to take care of themselves and of it. The military arm of their government, which they will not allow to direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make their Independence secure, and not their own independence merely, but the rights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put In jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the world, and particularly In this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied liy principle and by chastened am bttJon to play. It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense were conceived which will be laid before you. and which I urge yon to sanction and put Into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized and discussed They seem to me the essential first steps, and they seem to me for tbe present sufficient They contemplate an increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5.033 offi cers and tfW.MH enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7.130 officers and 134.707 enlisted men. or 111.843 all told, all services, rank and Die. by the addition of fifty-two companies of const artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four regiments of field artillery and four aero squadrons, besides 780 officers re quired for a great variety of extra service, especially the all Important duty of training the citizen force of which I shall presently speak, 702 non commissioned officers for service in drill, recruiting and the like and the necessary quota of enlisted men for the quartermaster corps, the hospital >rps. the ordnance department and ♦her similar auxiliary services. These are the additions necessary to render the army adequate for lta present du ties, duties which It has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts, but also In the Philippines. In tbe Hawaiian Islands, the Isth mus and In Porto Rleo. By way of making tie country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and ui>on a larger scale should occasion arise the plan also •■onteuiphites supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 dlsclpllued cltl zens, raised In Increments of 133.000 a year throughout a period of three year*. This it Is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of train ing for short periods throughout three years and to come to the colors at call ;»t any time throughout au additional "furlough" period of three years. This force of 400,090 men would be pro vided with personal accouterments as fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready *.o be supplied at any time. They would be assem bled for training at stated intervals at convenient places in association with suitable units of the Jf -tular army. Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months In the year. The president says it Is up to the patriotic young men of the country to respond to this call.
