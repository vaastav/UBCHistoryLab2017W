G. Robinson, recently decoased. But nothing has been given out for publication and nothing has beomsaid about the good U- gross his case has made from the .timcjbefore oven his local peti tion was undertaken. JNow that tho (appointment is- out' there mayjnot bo impropriety m pub- lishihg something of interest in this connection.5 So The "Bee is permitted tdflay that a letter was rccevecl here by a friend of Judge CowPli, written Novem ber .'27th, by Hon.
