DAKOTA, SOLOS BOBGIUH, a Parisian sculptor, has been in South Dakota for the last three months making models iq clay of Indians for the Paris exposition. He found some fine specimens of. the American aborigines among- the Sioux at the Crow Creek agency, South Da* kota, and succeeded in working up a half dozen models. A NOVEL way of illuminating a rail way tunnel has been devised TO Paris. Reflectors throw the light from many electric lamps 16 feet above the rails to the sides of the tunnel, where it is again reflected by burnished tin, a soft and agreeable light. The trains au» tomatically turn the current on: and off in entering the tunnel. OJTE of the most beautiful natural rock carvings in the world is the Southern Cross on the island of Grand Manan, in the Bay of Fundy. It stands at the head of a ledge of rocks jutting into tlie bay from the foot of one of the immense cliffs at the south* ern end of the Grand Manan. Its shape is that of an almost perfect Cross. SPEAKING of big salaries, the biggest on record was paid to George Gould. For ten years' work his father gave him 99,000,000. The account went down as "for services rendered." That was at the rate of $500,000 a year. The highest salary ever paid a railroad president was $75,000 a year that went to Sir William C. Van Horn when he was president of the Canadian Pacific. THE "Kreuz Zeitung" asserts that the Boers are using English cartridges from Kynochs, where Mr. Joseph Chamber lain's brother is a large shareholder. When war was seen to be inevitable, Kynochs underbid the German dealers and secured a big contract for cartridge es which they shipped as hamware, thus escaping seizure, thouglf they were landed just before the outbreak of the war. THE word "God" never appeared in" any government act until the year 1864 when, at the suggestion pf the director of the mint, ex-Gov. Pollock, of Penn sylvania, "In God We Trust" was stamped on the copper two-cent pieces. Before that time, "E Pluribus Dnum" had been the motto. Strange to relate, "E Pluribus Unutn" on coins never was authorized by law. Like Topsy, it just grew. Nearly all the' constitutions mention God. As the result of investigation by a South Carolina lawyer, Gov. Mc Sweeney has called on the governors of the southern states to join him in getting all southern congressmen to support a bill for refunding to right ful owners $11,000,000 now in the Unit ed States treasury as the proceeds of cotton seized during and immediately after the civil war and sold by treas nry officials. The governor is assured that action on this line will be unani mous. 

STSTEMS of electrically lighting rail road cars, particularly dining cars, sleepers and parlor cars, in which the current is generated by a dynamo geared to the car axle, are in .use on a number of railroad lines in this coun try. The high speed at .which these cars travel makes such an arrange ment quite satisfactory and easy to work out, current being supplied dur ing stoppages of the train from stor age batteries charged when the train la running. CONTRARY to the general opinion, more people go mad during the sum mer months than in the usually gloomy and dull months'of November, Decem ber and January, when times are bad and the general conditions appear more conducive to insanity. Not only in this country but also in many oth ers, it is found that more people go mad during May, June and July than during any other portion of the year, and that suicide—which is due to'some form of insanity—is also more preva lent during the summer. IKASUUCH as the electrolysis, which, according to experts, is causing rapid deterioration of the New York ele vated railroad structures, comes sup posedly from a current carried over the Brooklyn bridge, it is feared the bridge itself maybe undergoing dam age from the same cause. The places where electrolysis would be the most dangerous to the structure are at the anchors of the cables, which, being covered with masonry, can not be in spected If, however, the moisture has been excluded there is no danger of electrolysis. GASTON TISSANDIEB, the French aero naut, is dead. Originally a chemist, he devoted himself to the problem of« directing balloons, and rendered im portant services during the siege of Paris. His most memorable ascent was made in the balloon Zenith, in 1875, with Sivel and Croce-Spinelli, when, after reaching a height of over 26,000 feet, the balloonists became un conscious, and on reaching the ground again, it was found that Tissandier's two companions were dead. He was 56 years of age.

NATION'S FINANCES. Interesting: SCxtracta from the Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury. Washington, Dec. 7.—The annual report of the secretary of the treasury occupies 144 pages of closely, printed: matter, in cluding a large number of statistical tables, showing receipts and expenditures of the government during the year and compar isons with previous years. There are also estimates of the receipts for the next two years. The total receipts for the iiscal year, ended June 30, 1899, were $610,982,004,35, and the expenditures $700,093,564.02, showing a deficit of $89,111,559.67. The deficit for the .fiscal year shown by these tables amounts to $89,111,55937. Comparative tables showing receipts and expenditures of the year ended June 30, 1899, and June 30, 1898, show an Increase In receipts in 1899 of $116,648,050.60, and an in crease' in expenditures lor the same .year of $161,703,597.05. Estimates based on existing laws of the receipts and expenditures for the present year, ending June 30, 1900, show the prob able receipts to be $640,958,112.00, and the expenditures for the same time $600,958, 112.00, leaving a surplus of $40,000,000.00. The secretary strongly urges the estab lishment of the gold standard. On the subject of national banks he urges several modifications in existing laws, the first and most important of which is that the minimum of capitalization be placed at $25,000 Instead, of $50,000, as it now Is. He also suggests such modifications in exist ing banking laws as will limit the amount of liability a bank may carry upon a given amount of capital, pointing out that under existing laws the bank with $50,000 capital stands legally as free as does the bank with a capital of $5,000,000. Immigration statistics given show that there arrived during the fiscal year 1899 at ports of the United States and Canada 311,715 immigrants, exclusive of about 25,000 who, says the commissioner general, came as cabin passengersi and an unknown number from Mexico and Canada. The above total was composed of 297,349 from Europe, 8,972 from Asia, 51 from Africa, and 5.343 from all other sources, making an Increase over the number for the pre ceding year of 82,416, or nearly 36 per cent.

Manila, Dec. 5.—Aguinaldo's mother, who was captured by Maj. Crbnin with the little son of the insurgent leader and brought to Manila by order of Gen. Otis, said.in an interview: "I desire nothing but that peace may at once be secured. I am glad from the bot tom of my heart that the insurrection is near its end. Aguinaldo is not sufficiently civilized to keep from being misled by the bad counsel of his ministers and the mem bers of the Filipino congress. A.majority of those about him have, constantly de clared for war. Such a course has always been contrary to Aguinaldo's best judg ment, .but. he was weak enough to allow them to induce him to figbt.
