WASHINGTON, D. C., December 4. Congress Btnrted today with all the Hawaiions, usually hero during tlio winter months, on tho ground. Delegate Italanianaolo arrived hero a day or two ago, from his trip across tho continent 2nd tobk up his residence- at the Dewey Hotel. His secretary, Mr. Gcorgo B. McClollan, preceded him hero by several weeks. Judgo Hatch, who will look after tlio interests of tho Planters' Association, came hero a few days ago, accompanied by Mrs. Hatch and their daughter. He is temporarily at tho Now Willard Hotel, but is looking for a residence. Secretary A. L. C. Atkinson went over to New York last week on some business in connection with tho salo of bonds, but is expectod back today or very soon. Judge Hatch was welcomed by a number of friends, which made Ms coming to Washington again unusually pleasant. Ho said today that he had not found opportunity yet to tako up much business, nnd necessarily would mako linsto slowly at first. Secretary Atkinson has been continuing the work on which he was engaged when the last mail closed. Tho checking of Hawaiian laws for the codo most of his evenings. Ho had a satisfactory talk with Commissioner General of Immigration Sargent, but has nothing definite yet to announce. Ho will tako up with Secretory Taft at an enrly day tho matter of securing transportation to tho mainland nnd back of teachers in Hawaii, who would like to attend tho summer school at tho University of California. Tlio Hawaiian delegnto said today that ho had thought of tho advisability of discussing with tho President tho protest forwarded hero against Governor Carter's decision not to sell bonds for tho full amount authorized by tho last legislature. He has been too busy getting settled for tho session to have undertaken any Congressional work thus far. The annual report of tho Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Mr, Ycrkcs, gives figures on internal rovenuo collections in Hawaii. Tho total collections for tho last fiscal year were $44,230.43, which is only $2,000 less than was collected in Arizona, $7,000 less than was collected in Nevada, and moro than was collected in Now Mexico, North Dakota, Vermont or Wyoming. Two illicit stills wore seized nnd destroyed during tho fiscal year; fivo illicit stills were seized and removed. Seventeen arrests wcro made in connection with those seizures. Hawaii had during tho last fiscal year S53 special taxpayers. Of these thrco were rectifiers, 433 wcro retail liquor dealers; 48 wcro wholesale liquor dealers, one was a brewer, fifty-four wcro retail dealers in malt liquors; cloven woro wholesale- dealers in malt liquors. Thero wero two dealers in olcomargerino containing no artificial coloration and one wbb n wholesalo dealer in the same ' article. Hawaii had moro special taxpayers than Delaware, or Alaska, or Indian , (Territory, and almost as many as Mississippi, which had 002. Vermont had but special taxpayers, it being virtually a prohibition state. S'380 THE 

CONGHESSIONAL OUTLOOK. Tho session of Congress -begins with less general interest in legislative mat- ters than is usually tho cose. Both Scbators and members havo been very tardy in arriving. Thus far no moasure has been much discussed among tho arrivals I oxcopt railroad rato legislation. It is generally concoded that there will bo .some kind of rata legislation, but just what it will bo is not yet clear. The President nnd his friends bclievo they aide. While tho surrender of somo opponents of rato legislation has discouraged tho so-called conservatives, it is apparent that thero will be a fight before the bill is passed. Lawyers and railroad officials havo been flocking to Washington to study tho situation and glvo advice on different bills submitted. Speaker Cannon plans to speed tho work of Congress for all thero is in him. Ho wants to announce his committees next week and havo them busy preparing measures for report before the holidays so that members can have something to deliberate upon between Christmas and New Years except their own affairs.

County Attorney Douthltt, In nn opinion, relieved the Hoard of any liability in the recent nctlon of the police at the Mendonca Uulldlng. It was announced that Mendonca Intended suing Assistant Deputy Sheriff Vlda for $5,-000 damages, Lucas suggested under the circumstances putting In a new glass. Adams wns authorized to enter into negotiations. President Plnkhnm of the Board of Health, In n letter, said the Iwllcl government wnshhouses were In nn condition. He advocated tho floors 3 feet, and making a new building, with only one long room nnd fitted with modern washing npparatus. The present Bystom tore the clothes nnd broke the buttons. Ho added, "I want to make friends of the Supervisors, for later I will need their help and endorsement for the good of tho Honolulu that Is to be." Thero was considerable discussion over the disposition of garbage. Mr. Lucas stated that with President Pink- ham of the Health Board, Dr. Cofer and others, he had Inspected tho Iwllcl burning dumps last Sunday. Dr. Cofer pronounced this method surprisingly good. As to the crematory It was announced that this would cost $800 to maintain. To offset this cost the re- celpts amounted to nbout the same sum. Nothing was done about this matter. I John Aslng wns nppolnted road overseer for Koolauloa at $50 per month. A telephone was ordered Installed between the Pnele and Aslng homes.

PROBLEMS OF HAWAII. h In my judgment immcdlato steps should bo taken for tho 7) $ tion of Hawaii. This is tho most important point In tho Pacific to fort- $ y lfy in order to conscrvo tho interests of tills country. It would bo hard t to overstate tho importance of this need. Hawaii is too heavily taxed. Laws should bo enacted sotting asido for a poriod of say twonty yoars, 75 per cent of tho internal revenue and customs roccipts from Hawaii as a special fund to be expended in tho islands for educational and public buildings, and for harbor improvements and military and naval defonsos. It cannot bo too often repeated that our aim must be to dovolop tho Territory of Hawaii on traditional American lines. That Territory' has serious commercial and industrial problems to reckon with; but no mcoauro of rolicf con bo considorod which looks to legislation admitting Chinese and restricting thorn by statuto to field labor and domestic Tlio status of servility can never again bo tolerated on Amorican soil. We cannot conccdo that the proper solution of its problems is special legislation admitting to Hawaii a class of laborers denied admission to the other States and Territories. Thore are obstacles, and great obstacles, In the way of building up a representative community in tho Hawaiian Islands; but It is not In the Amorican charactor to give up in tho face of difficulty. Many an American commonwealth has bcon built up against odds equal to those that now confront Hawaii. No merely half-hearted effort to meet its problems as othor American communities have met theirs can be accepted as final. Hawaii shall never become a Territory in which a governing class of rich planters' exists by moons of coolio labor. Even if the rate of growth of the Territory Is thereby rendered slower, the growth must only take placo by tho admission of immigrants fit in dens of full American citizenship. rltory on the same basis of stable the end to assume the duties and bur- Our aim must be to develop the Ter- V citizenship as exists on this continent. Y 

OTHER POINTS OF THE MESSAGE. REGULATION OP RAILROAD RATES Tho President's message recommends national supervision of corporations and calls for action by Congress on tho control of insuranco companies, State nuthority having proved inadequate. The President ngaln advises Fcdoral regulation of railway rates, proposing that tho powers of tho Interstate Commerco Commission bo greatly increased. 

SYSTEM OF DUAL TARIFF SCHEDULE Tho message is very briof on tho tariff question. Congress is nsked to consider the dual tariff system, tho minimum and maximum schedules to to "securo u certain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves." FUBLIOITY IN CAMPAIGN FUNDS Full publicity is urged in regard to campaign contributions. It is also proposed that contributions by corporations for any political purpose bo forbidden by law. PEACE AND THE MONROE DOCTRINE Tho desire of this nation for peace is sot forth in tho message, but a warning is raised against disarming, which would removo tho bonds that hold lawlessness in check among tho less civilized countries. Tho now obligations of tho Monroo doctrino must bo assumed, says tho President, and have already been undertaken in tho caso of Santo Domingo with excellent results. 

CHANGES IN THE IMMIGRATION LAWS Radical changes in tho immigration laws are proposed in order to prevent the entrance of undesirables from Europe. Tho President stands for the strict exclusion of Chinese coolies, but urges better treatment for tho exempt classes. PANAMA CANAL AND PHILIPPINES An emergency appropriation is asked for the Panama canal. The President believes that tho big waterway will be constructed in reasonable time. Ultimate freo trade with the Philippines and the suspension of the application of tho coast-wise shipping laws to those islands until 1909 are recommended. 

DEATH OF F. M. HUSTEDXj'i DIRECTORY PUBLISHER HU8TED -In this city, December 3, 1905, Frederic M., beloved bus-band of Anglo Holcomb Huated, and beloved father of Kdlth Husted and Mrs. W. A. Crossman, a native of Starksboro, Vt., aged 55 years and 4 months. Mrs. Husted writes: "Will you kindly insert a copy of the above in your paper and state also that the directory business heretofore conducted by the Into F. M. Husted will be continued by the widow of Mr. Husted under the same management." Hawaiian legislation at that ond of the Capitol lias'not been made up and will not be for some little time. Senators Mitchell, of Oregon, and Burton, of Kansas, are both mombors. There is a movement on foot to appoint neither of them to any committees, as both are now under sentence for violating United States statutes. It is doubtful, however, whether such action will bo taken, notwithstanding the fact that there is a very strong sentiment for expressing disapproval of both senntors in that fashion. Probably the President's recommendation to set apart a portion of tho revenues from the torrltory of Hawaii for the support of schools will figure quite prominently this winter In the discussion of Hawaiian affairs at the Capitol. As was written some months ago, the outlook is not bright for generous appropriations this year, The loaders oro already setting their face against liny legislation that calls for unusual expenditure.

ML 1 1S unci, (From Sunday's Advertiser) Tho funeral of tho late Charles II. Ramsay took place yesterday at the undertaking parlors of II. H, AVIlllams. The services which preceded the burial In Nuuanu cemetery were conducted by Hev. Mr, Wadnian, after which the 131ks took charge. Following Is Mr. Wadmnn's address; Wo are gathered here today under circumstances singularly sad and distressing. Death in any caso Is mysteriously sad, but when it takes place as It has in the case of our mutual friend nnd whoso obsequies we nre mot here to obseive, It Is peculiarly distressing. Mr. Ramsay was much better known to most of you than to myself. He had lived In Honolulu upwards of twelve years. During that period ho had been well known In business nnd social circles. It was here he married and here his four sweet children wore born, Ills early home was in New York State, where a very Infirm and aged mother nnd several beloved brothers nnd Bisters still reside. He was a beloved son nnd a very affectionate brother. One of the most touchlngly affectionate letters I have ever read was one written by a sister during a recent Illness ot his from which it was thought ho might (Hot recover. To those distant loved- ones tho news of his sudden and sad decease will surely come with a crushing blow. Let us all earnestly pray that the "Everlasting Arms"' of tho Eternal God may be beneath them with comforting and sustaining power. I havo never lived in a community where citizens wero more deeply kind and sympathetic than In Honolulu, nnd especially under sorrowful circumstances such as these which bring us here todny. On nil sides people nro rcnchlng out their hands and nsklng, "What can wo do? How can we help?'1 I can assuro the members of the bereaved family assembled with us that all our hearts are deeply touched, and In prnyer to the Loving Father we bow and beseech Him ns tho God of all grace to vouchsafe Ills timely grace anj loving presence. You nro ull well nware of tho subtle causes at work for quite a period which ended In the tragedy of a few hours ago. Business failures, physical weakness, mental dlspondency, notwithstanding all thnt could be done by a devoted wife and loving friends, conspired towards his rapid and rash undoing. Nothing remains In the form of keen regret or bitter rellectlon. Loving hands had constantly ministered to n heart broken with disappointment nnd a mind crushed with a weight of despondency for which It seemed ns though nature failed to supply a sufficient courage and strength to overcome. Ills rash act was not that of a sane man. He was not himself not by any means the gifted, manly man of other years whom men admired for his sterling character and congratulated upon his success. Yes he had his faults, his weakness, his Imperfections. Who of us have not? "Let him that is without sin cast the first stone." These, his faults and mistakes, are gladly covered with the montlo of Christian charity, and whllo we bear his body to Its last resting place, wn all pray that his ashes may rest In peace and In loving faith commend his dear wife, sweet children, faithful mother-in-law and all his kindred across the seas to the watchful caro and tender love of ono whose grace will enable his children to have a childlike submission to the Divine Will and we say: "The Lord hath given and tho Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of tho Lord."
