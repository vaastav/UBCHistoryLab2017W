Following is a synopsis thereof : The President introduces his message With the statement that business has been transacted by the several departments dur ing the year with faithfulness, energy and Success. Revenues amounting to above 9450,000,000 have been collected without revealing a single case of defalcation false statement. This good work, the President says. ... no', his, out is shared by the heads ot sev eral departments with the great, body of faithful officers and those who served under them. 5th« friendly relations of our country with all nations, and refers to the recent confer ences held in Washington by representa tives of South and Central American tries as marking an interesting and influ ential epoch in the history of the Western Hemisjihere. Another worthy feature of the Pan-American conference, lie says, was that Brazil, being under an imperial form iff government, shared as a republic in the deliberations and the results of the conference. Toward the end of the past year the only independent monarchie! government of the western continent, that of Brazil, ceased to exist and was succeeded by a publie. Diplomatic relations were at once established with the new government, but it was not completely recognized until opportunity had been afforded to ascertain that it had'oopular approval and support. When the course of events had yielded as surance of this fact, no time was lost in ex tending to the new government a full and cordial welcome into the family. The President refers to the killing of General Barrundia ßtates steamer Acapulco and : United States Minister Mizner exceeded his authority in granting a provisional order to Guatamahau officers to take General / Barrundia from the vessel, in defending • which action Barrundia lost his life. He further announces that Minister Mlzncr ha* been recalled fr The President calls the attention of C gress to the various subjects under discus sion with other nations, which arc pond ing in a friendly manner, and continuing Bays: President notes the board the United s that his post. 

MEXICO. OÜB RELATIONS The friendship between our country Mexico, born of close ties and strength ened by many considerations of intimate intercourse and reciprocal interest, has conspicuous than more hopeful of increased benefit both nations. The intercourse of the two countries by rail, already great, is making constant growth. The established lines and those recently projected add to the intimacy of traffic and »Mien new channels of access to fresh areas of demand and ply.

No bill was ever framed, suppose, that in all of its rates and Classi fications had the full approval even of a party caucus. Such legislation is always and necessarily the product of compromise as to details and tin* present law is no ex ception, but in its general scope and effect. 1 think it will justify the support of those who believe that American legislati should conserve and defend American trade und the wages of American workmen. The misinformation as to the terms of the act. which has been so wildly disseminated home and abroad, will no corrected by experience, and the evil auguries results, confounded bv the market reports, the savings banks, international trade bul the general prosperity of people. Already we begin to bear from 1 from our custom houses that the prohibitory effect upon importations imputed to the act is not justified. The imports at the port of New York for the first three weeks of November were nearly eight per cent greater than for the same period of 18*9, and 29 per cent greater than m the same period of 18*8, and so far fr< s being an act to limit exports, I confidently believe that under it we shall secure a larger and more profit able participation in foreign trade joyed, and that we participation j !
