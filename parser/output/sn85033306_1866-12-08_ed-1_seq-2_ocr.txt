The message open:-, ti? usual, with thanks to Provi ncc for peace and prosperity, in the abatement Oi the pestilence and the restoration of civil authority througout the United Slates. A review is then had of the facts set forth in the last message, relative to the measures v.hie'n the Executive had taken for the grad ual restoration of the Southern States to the Union, such na appointing Provisional ( yv ernors, etc. Only one thing then remained, the message says, to be dune, and that was the admission of tho loyal representatives to Congress. This question was devolved fiolely on Congress. In the meantime, the President says, no other dan having been proposed, he continued his efforts te perfect a restoration through the judicial, revenue, and postal systems of the country. Tho South had also ratified the amend ment abolishing slavery, conformed their social laws to the fact, repudiated the rebel debts and proceeded in good faith to legislate for the amelioration of the colored racer-. The President then speaks as follows ; " Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these States to representation, and it was near the close of the eighth month of the Hession that an exception was made ia favor uf Tennessee. " i deem it a subject of profound regret that Congress has thus far failed to admit to Feats the loyal Senators and Ucpresentativcs Irani the other States wherein the inhabitants, with those of Tennessee, had engaged in rebellion ; tn States, more than one-fourth of the whole number, remain without rep resentation. Tho seats of fifty members of the House and twenty of the Senate are yet j vacant, not by their own consent, noi by a I failure of election, but by the refusal ot j Congress t) accent their credentials. 41 1 heir ad mis-iion it s belie ire 1, would have accompli ie 1 much toward the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one people, and removed serious cause for dis content on the part of tho people of these States. It would have accorded with the Treat principle eminent! ta m too leciara- tion of American Independ ence, that no people ought to near too buruen ol taxation and yet be denied representation. It would Lave been in consonance with the express provisions of the Constitution, that each 1.. . . 1 .. State shall have at least one Representative, and that no State, without its consent, idiall be deprived of equal suffrage in the Senate. 11 These provisions were in tended to secure to every State the right of representation in Congress, and so important was it deemed by the i'ramer.s of the Constitution that (lie equality of States shall bo preserved in the Senate, that not even oy an amendment ot is, that the pernmmary laws i-c success the Constitution can any State, without its fully and finally passed without impaling consent, be denied a voice 111 that branch of the National Legislature. 11 It has. been assumed that these States by rebellion became Territories, but all depart ments of the Government with great distinct- ness, refused to sanction au assumption so suits of peace. - Directing our etlorls to the incompatible with the nature of our Repub- early accomplishment of the great ends, lican system, and the professed objects of j let us endeavor to preserve harmony between the war. Throughout the recent legislation of I the co ordinate departments of the Gover Congress, the undeniable fact m ikes itst-lf j ment, that each in its proper sphere may apparent that these ten political communt- j cordially co-oporate with the other nine ties are nothing but States." curing the maintenance cf the Conslitu Tho President then quotes the Crittenden l tion, the preservation of the Union, and the resolutions ol I80I, on the object of the war, and reviews tue legislation ol Con gress wherein the States are recognized, and also in Lincoln's proclamation. Ho then proceeds again, as follows : "In the admission of Senators and Rep--rescntatives from all the States there can be i-.o grounus n apprenensiou mat persona who iire ihsioyal will he clothed with the I powers of legislation, for this could not hap pen when tho Constitution and Jaws are enforced by a vigilant an 1 faithful Congress. Each House isthe judge of its own members. A senator or member may be admitted or rejected or Ids credentials referred to' a proper committee. If admitted to a seat, it must be on evidence satisfactory that he possesses the rcquisito loyal and constitu tional qualifications. If refused i-diai.-r-ion, and sent to his constituents for want of due allegiance, they are a irnoni.-.ucd that none but j crseus loyal to the United State, will be allowed m the councils ot t ils of the nation, nnd inlluoncji of Con-ress rted in the interest of the power and moral in are thus "ilectiieiy exertc-i 111 me interest ot b.yalty to the Government and fidelity to the Union. - Upon this question, so vitally affecting the 'restoration of the Union, and the per- inaiu-ncy of our form of governmeat, my convictions, heretofore expressed, have t.n- derg. .ne no change, but, on the contrary, ttu ir correctness have been confirmed reflection and time. "If the admis-don of L.yal members to n ats in Congre.-s was wise and expedient a year no .v now a-, it 1 i no le; w ise and expedient If this anomalous condition is right -if ia the cxaet condition of th Strtts at the present timr, it is lawful to ex. elude th.cm from representation, 1 do not see that the question will be changed by tho c-HVet of time.

All he says on reconstruction I hare driven verb a fiiri . Ti.i! President speaks as fvliowi on Mexi can all urs in we uioiiui oi ,Viu x., u o.ii of U aware, a friendly a-reernont was ma.le between the Jmperor ot J-niieu rnd the 'resident, for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary force. This withdrawal was to be eli'ectt-d in three de tachments, t! stoo-1, was to of which it was under- b-.ileo i:i November, tlie sec .nd in Mar.-h, nnd the. third in Novemher, 1 SOT. Immediately on the completion of the evac'.iat;n, the French Government was to assume lac sun- attitude in rc-.oard to j r.on-intcrventii-n; ns is l;o'd by the United ! States. Repeated assurance's have been I siven t'ae President since that aiTcemctit, I tliat Fn w mill )U1 ph te tho promised evacuation within the rm-i 1 or even sooner. "It was reason. ibly exacted that the pro cee ling thus contemplated would produeo : crisis 01 rreat political interest in the He public of Mexico. Th" newly appointed Minister of the UnV.ed S;.afe, 'Mr." Cetnp beil was therefore sent forward on October 0 fri :koiihi f'orii-fiorij It, sihn thought expedient that he should be attended in the. vicinity of -Mexico by the lieutenant deneral oi tae Lnuej Mates a:mv, w;t!i the view of obiainir.r such information as miglit be import mt to of'termine tne course to oe pursuou oy urn unox-u itaies ia re- estaouMung ami maintaining necessary and proper intercourse with Mexico. Deeply in terested in thcj-.ause of liberty ami hum in it y, it seemed an obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever intiucriec we possessed for the restoration and permanent estabalish m -nt in that country of a domestic and re publican form of government " Se:ch was the condition of affairs in re gard to Mexico, when, on the 25d of No vember, oaieial information was received from Paris that the Emperor had some timer before decided not to withdraw detach ments of his forces in the month of Novem ber, according to agreement ; but this deci sion was made for the purpose of withdraw ing the whole of these forces in the ensuing spring. Of this l itter determination, how ever, the United States has received no notice or intimation, and so soon as this informa tion was revived by this Government, care was taken to make known its dissent to the Emperor of France. " 1 can not forego the hope that France will reconsider the subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which will conform to the existing engagement, and meet the expectations of this Government. The documents on the subject will be laid before Congress. With the evacuation of Mexico by the French, no subject for serious difference between France and the United States would remain." On our relations with Great Britain the President writes as follows : It is a matter of regret that no considerable advance has been made toward an adjust mcufc of the differ ence between the United States and Great liritan, "arising out of the depredations on our national commerce, and other trespasses commited during the civil war by British subjects, in violation of international law and treaty obligations. The delay, however, may bo believed to have resulted in no small degree from the domestic situation of Great Britan. An entire change of Ministry oc curcd in that country during the last ses sion of Parliament. The attention of the new Ministry was called to the subject at an earlv daw and there is some reason to be- ! lieve that it will be considered in a ; becoming and friendly spirit. " 1 he importance ot ai early uisposition of the question cannot be exaggerated, Whatever might be the wish.es of the two Governments, 11 is manifest that lrier.dship and uood will between the two countries J cannot be established until a reciprocity in the practice of good faith and neutrality shall be restored between the respective na tions. The President then alludes to the Fenian invasion of Canada as a violation of the neu trality laws and the sentence of captured ! Fenians he says: "Such reprcsentationshave . i . ! !) -1 :l : . i been mane to vjreai uritam as win, it i hoped induce judicious amnesty to .all who I were engaged in the. invasion." t After re fori ng briellv to the annual re- ports, the President concludes as loilows : "In tiie performance of a duty imposed by the constitution, I have submitted to the Representatives of the States and the people such information of our domesfie and for eign affairs as the public interest may re quire, uur uovermenu.s now unoergoing us j most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer j its original strength ami symmetry, me interests ol the nation are hest to be pro moted bv the veival fraternal relations, the complete obliteration of our past differ- ! ences, and the inauguration cf all the pur- perpetuity ot tree institutions.
