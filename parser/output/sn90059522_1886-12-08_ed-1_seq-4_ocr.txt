C. 3lki.lf.ttk, who masquerades un der the title of "Governor" of Dakota and the sum ami substance of whose politi- . cal wisdom may be gauged by his profound j remark that "Democracy is stupid and it j never learns anything.*' is busily engaged j drawing up the programme to be followed : by the'* '814110"' legislature to convene at ; Huron on Dec. 15. "Gov."' Mellette Is one i of those enthusiastic individuals who desire \ to erect South Dakota at once into a state t Without regard to the formality of congres sional sanction and heedless of the wishes of North Dakota. Whether the fact that j he is to occupy the gubernatorial chair in | the new state has anything to do with his j impetuosity in the matter is not clear, but | it is plain enough that he considers further j delay not only tiresome but dangerous. If j congress will not recognize South Dakota's i claim be thinks it the bounden duty of that \ portion of the territory to take the ! matters out of its hands. While consider- ] ing this matter in detail, the "state" legis lature will debate the advisability of sub mitting to the people an amendment repeal ing the 33d section of the "state" constitu tion, wh eh prevents the "state" officers from exercising their functions until the or ganization is recognized by congress. It looks very much as though a large body of intelligent men was, going to meet for pur poses of very profitless discussion in the convening of the "state" legislature. The ; only way for Dakota to secure statehood Is through the sanction of congress and, big as she is, able as her citizens undoubtedly are. it is useless for her to attempt to bluff Con gress into a premature recognition of her merits. Despite "Gov." Mellette's ex pressed lack of confidence in the Dem ocracy, there is every reason to suppose that the Democrats in the national legisla tive body are quite ready to do Dakota justice as soon as the citizens of the terri tory agree among themselves as to the basis upon which they want to be admitted. So far as the matter of division is concerned. South Dakota, represented by Mellette and his associates, is taking rather an ar bitrary and high-handed course of pro cedure. It is a matter in which the whole territory is interested, and in which accord ingly the whole territory should have a voice. The question of division should be submitted us speedily as possible to the people, • 'and-- their decsion being made known, congress should not delay in grant ing Dakota the boon for which she is well entitled to ask. THE CO-OPERATIVE SYSTEM. The September publication issued by the American Economic association is entitled "Co-operation In a Western City," written by Dr. Albert Shaw, of Minneapolis, lt is a pamphlet of over 100 pages, containing a history of the origin and progress of the co-operative movement in our sister city, and is a valuable contribution to the grow ing mass of illustrative material out of which. as Dr. Shaw appropriately remarks, the useful principles and hopeful plans of tlie future'are to be evolved. The article commences with a history of the initial movement as far back as 1868, when an at tempt was made to establish a cooper shop on the co-operative plan. The original movers iii th is* organization were C. W. Cur tis. F. L. Bacheldeil Peter Kenny, J. W. OvKii acker. 11. E. Roberts. W. 11. Beeves. Georoe W. Sargent and Joseph Combs. Dr. Shaw says that there was no romance in the inception of the co operative system of production, the move ment being inaugurated without the laying on of apostolic hands and received no cod dling advertising. It was an obscure movement, and so far as it was known or noticed it met with disfavor and distrust It was not until after several struggles that the co-operative system got fairly on its feet in IST4 by the organization of the Co operative Barrel Manufacturing company. An important feature of th's organization was the distinction between the two kinds of profit and loss, one affecting the men as capitalists and the other kind affecting them as laborers, a distinction which has not been made by co-operative societies elsewhere, and which, according to Dr. Shaw's opinion, shows keen economic in sight, and has great practical value. The article then proceeds to give an interesting history of the progress made by the several successive co-operative organizations, in cluding the co-operative agricultural col ony, mercantile company, laundry, the Dundas coopers, profit sharing in the Pillsbury mills, co-operation among the painters and building associations of both St. Paul and Minneapolis, as well as the vari ous unsuccessful , attempts at co-operation. The article throughout is a valuable and en tertaining treatise on the co-operative sys tem and its results, and the Economic association displays wisdom in presenting it to the public, under its auspices. THE NATIONAL PARK. Secretary Lamar's suggestions in bis annual report regarding the National Park should receive the discriminating attention of congress, It will require ;he most stringent legislation to preserve the attract iveness of this resort, which has become not i only national, but world-wide in its fame. All the natural features which now consti tute its attractiveness should be rigidly maintained, and this can only be accom plished through the most rigid govern mental supervision. While it is a question whether military or civil control is best adapted for the purpose, there Is no doubt at all that more strict supervision is necessary iv the future. Almost the last resort of the noted varieties of larger game, it Is In dan ger of losing that distinction through the depredations of unauthorized hunters. The governing officers of the park should be invested with complete authority for the detection and punishment of such offenders. In addition, the commercial spirit which seeks to turn the park into a money-making institution under government protection, should be curbed so far as is consistent with the provision of comfort for the j tourists. During: the past sear.on the park j I was visited by a greater number of travel- j ' ers ' than ever before. It has become, in; every sense, a national pleasure resort. It is only by the most thorough control that i ! such a character can be preserved for it, i and no false ideas of economy should actuate congress in considering any meas ures calculated to bring about that desirable enaf. _ WOMEN AND TEMPERANCE. ' The women who aro engaged In temper ance work in this country have manifested wonderful zeal in the cause, and in many instances have accomplished much good, j But, like all people who become infatuated . with one idea, they are liable now and then . to be guilty of an excessive devotion to a i cause that subjects them to ridicule. A i lamentable illustration of this was recently \ furnished in the action of the Woman's Temperance association in Missouri, in relation to Mrs. Secretary Whitney's re ceptions. Because the wife of the naval secretary gave a social entertainment, and set wines and brandies before her guests, the Missouri women who are engaged in temperance immediately gath-.red them selves into a convention and passed resolu tions severely condemning Mrs. Whitney, j This action of the temperance association j was impertinent, if not downright impu dent. No woman, or body of women, has the right to establish a censorship over the households ot the land. Mrs. Whitney. like every other American lady, is the queen of her own home, and she has the right to regulate her domes tic empire according to her Individ ual notions and sense of propriety. The American home is a domain which ought to be sacred from the invasion of im pertinent critics. If the Missouri women who are finding fault with Mrs. Whitney's bill of fare at her social receptions do 'not like her style, they are under no obligations to either accept her hospitality or to imitate her methods. But there is no warrant in ethical or social codes to publicly condemn her conduct. If the temperance women persevere in this disposition to meddle with private domestic affairs, they will soon place themselves beyond the pale of social recognition, and will.be looked upon as a body of meddlesome old grannies, deserving the respect of nobody, aud inviting the con tempt of all. The appeal . recently issued by the Women's National Temperance as sociation to the workingmen of the country, asking their co-operation in the temperance work, was a noble document, capable of accomplishing great good. But a few more breaks like the one made by the Missouri sisters will upset all the good work that Miss Will has been doing. TARIFF EXTORTION. There is one sentence in the president's message which will attract the attention of I the Minnesota farmers. It is the one which occurs in his discussion of tariff reduction, and reads as follows: "Our fanners, too. and those engaged directly and indirectly in supplying the products of agriculture, I see that day .by day, and as often as the j ! daily wants of their households recur, they j are forced to pay excessive and needless , taxation, while their products struggle in ! foreign markets with the competition of \ nations which, by allowing a freer exchange j of productions than we permit enable their ] people to sell for prices which distress the I American fanner." That is a picture so familiar to every Northwestern farmer that none will fail to recognize it. He knows that the protective policy has reduced the price of his wheat and his farm products. lie never sits down to a meal nor stretches himself for rest on his j couch that he does not realize that \ in procuring these comforts he has paid a tax into the treasury of some manufactur ing or importing firm which only serves to make them richer and to make him poorer. j The president has succeeded in drawing a homely picture of the extortion of our sys tem of federal taxation that will be a more forcible argument to the minds of Minne sota farmers in favor ot tat iff revision than all the elegant sophistries that the advocates of protection can pile up from now until doomsday. And while this subject has been brought home so forcibly to the minds of our farmers, it might not be amiss to re mind them the approaching legislature will elect a senator who will have a voice in framine our tariff laws for the future. And at the same time we take the liberty to sug gest that it is a duty the farmers of Minne sota owe to themselves to see that a sena tor is elected who will be hi accord with their ideas and- who will exert his influence in protection of tneir interests. ■ AN 

UNFAIR CRITICISM. In his criticism of the president's mes sage Senator McMillan does himself the discredit of appearing in the light of a fac tions partisan, without adding a particle to his reputation as a fair-minded manor im partial critic. When he says that the pres ident straddles the tariff question he simply exhibits his ignorance of the president's position. There isn't anything in the message which indicates a straddle on any question, and so far as the tar if is concerned language could not be formed to give a clearer or more direct expression of opinion iv favor of tariff revision and tariff reduction. If Senator McMillan would plant himself as squarely in favor of tariff reform as Mr. Cleveland has done, the senator would stand a better show of succeeding himself in the senate than the present outlook pre sents. 

JUDGE REAGAN'S ASPIRATIONS. A Texas telegram announces that Judge John 11. Reagan is a candidate to suc ceed Maxey in the United States senate, with a fair prospect of election. If Judge Reagan gets to the senate it will be after a hard tussle with the railroad influence. But as Texas has never been a profitable field for corruption boodle, the country may yet have the satisfaction of seeing the dis tinguished anti-monopolist grace the sen ate chamber. It would be a proud day for the country when Reagan was elevated to the senate. —.as*— IT IS ALL RIGHT. A conclave of Democratic leaders is to be held at Columbus on the Bth of January to consult with reference to the condition of the Democratic party throughout the coun try. In advance of the meeting we arise to remark that if the condition of the Demo cratic party throughout the country is up to the Minnesota -standard all the distin guished leaders will have to do on assem bling will be to drink one bumper to the good health of the party and then go home in good spirits. — —^— The estimable Duluth Herald should lose no time in appreciating the fact thai Minne sota's Democratic congressmen-elect do not take their seats at the present session. Though the Herald's desire to see them seated at once is commendable enough, un fortunately they cannot be sworn in until after Marcn 4 next. . People who can't afford a trip to Washing ton may get a good idea of the way the con ! gressional mill grinds by observing the Min j nesota legislature when it meets, and they i will have an opportunity, too, of observing i about as much concentrated wisdom as gath ers itself in the national legislative halls. ■ - »•■" —^a— Now if that prominent board of trade man j in Chicago, who has been fined $8,000 because , of an undervaluation of some paintings he j ! was importing, can induce the customs of- 1 ficials to enter a little board deal he may be ! able to get square, after all. «. v The latest whim among Eastern dudes is to I give their hair the appearance of beinj gray. ■Ii 'would make the hair of an ordinarily intel ligent person turn gray to keep track of the THE; ST.

HUNDRED MORE SALOONS. The Council Passes an Ordinance to : ~?Vj: ''■', Allow TOO to do Business. Sale of Ice From the River Prohibited --Routine Council Business. . . Attbe regular meeting of the council last night an ordinance changing the figures 600 to 700 la ordinance 537, regarding the number of saloon licenses to be issued, was adopted, j the ordinance to take effect Jan. 1, 1888. Aid. Kerr said that the date of the ordinance . should be Jan. 1, 18S7, instead of 1886, but ' City Attorney Murray explained that there i had been a considerable number of saloons that had been "-tnining under permits, with no license. The ordinance was j dated Jan. 1, IsBB. to oover these cases. The mayor sent to the council a communica- j tion from Charming Seabury, relative to the , money dispensed to the cyclouo sufferers at j Sauk Rapids and St. Cloud, which was referred - ' to the committee on wa s und means. The mat ter of grading Fauquier sucei, from Earl to English, was sent to the board of public works on a petition from William Dawson and others. Nellie Walsh, who received injuries by falling on the pavement on Fourth street, near Jackson, gave notice that she would sue the city for damages. The committee on streets and city attorney will discuss the petition. Petition from resi dents of the Fourth ward asking for a market house and grounds on West Seventh street near the Chicago. Milwaukee & St. Paul rail road crossing, was referred to the committee on public grounds and buildings. Tbe city attorney submitted an agreement regarding the use of poles on certain streets jointly by the Edison Electric Light and Power company, the city and fire alarm system. The agree ment provides for poles 5J leet high to be put in place of those now in use by the Edison company. : The company is to bear all the ex penses of the change and the fire alarm wires are to be placed 10 feet above the electric light wires.' The agreement holds for Aye years. Aid. Starkey thought it might be amended so as to allow any city wires on the poles, such as the police alarm wires. The agreement aud an ordinance granting the American District Telegraph compauy the right to erect poles and string wires, were referred to the committees on police and fire department. F. H. Schade was allowed $43 lor earth de posited on Webster street in April, 1873, the claim being reported as legal by the city at torney. In tne matter of grading and con structing a main newer on fcdgcitou street, lrom Decatur to Mar.) land street, the city en gineer reported that the cost would be $20, --315 for grading, tie" sewer would require $25, --000 of bonds to be i.-sued, and the bridge over Fauquier street $10,000 more. The. matter was referred to Blue alderman of tho district. The fire com missioners reported the purchase of property at Oak and Ninth street as a site lor the new No. 1 engine bouse, and a resolution author izing the payment of Sa,ooo for the same was passed. The council decided the application of B. Michel and otners asking for the vacat ing of a part of Pleasant avenue, between James and Randolph streets. That part of Prior avenue, between St. Anthony avenue and the Chicago, Milwankee & St. Paul road, was declined vacated as prayed for by John L. Merriam and others. mWDtm The board of public works reported on the paving of the struts on St. Anthony hill as published in the (it. .v.: yesterday, and the same were approved by the council. The re port on the paving of Holly avenue, when read by the clerk, was referred back to the boa.d of public works, together with a remonstrance presented by Aid. Sanborn. The alderman further stated that he thought no street snould be paved unless it was demanded by the property owners. Tho owners on Holly avenue wanted the street paved with asphalt when it was paved, but desired to wait a year and see how tne same pavement on Summit avenue turned out. FOR LIGHTING LAMPS. The contract for lighting of such streets a« deemed proper, with gasoline or oil lamps, was let to Robert Seeger at the rate of $.) each per year, for a term tit three years. Pat rick O'Kegan was ordered paid SoOO for serv ices as sealer of weights and measures in 1864 and 1885. The committee on public buildings favored a rejection of two bids for plumbing at the Foundlings home, ami that the clera re a ivertise for bids. The ordinance relat ing to the sale of ice cut or taken from tho river was adopted after a slight skirmish. Aid. Minea thought tne ordinance was a hardship on the brewers, who would not be allowed to use the ice for pac ing their cooling vaults, lt was explained that the ordinance was to prevent the sale oily. Aid. Luhen wanted the ice from Lake Como, also barred. This brought out an explanation from the health officer, who thought the amendment would deleat the ordinance. The water of the lake. Dr. Jones explained, while containing some vegetable mutter, was healthy compared to the river. Tue amend ment offered by Aid. Cullen was passed, but on a motion of Aid Sanborn was reconsid ered and carried by a vote of 8 to 7, the president voting in favor of the recommendation. The question on the adoption of the amendment forbidding the sale of ice cut from Lake Como was lost, and the ordinance, as recommended by the board of health, passed. City Attorney Murray and the city engineer recommended the building of a bridge at the Dale street crossing of the Manitoba road. The report stated that the railroad company had agreed to build a bridge at the point mentioned pro viding the city abandon what is known as the old Como bridge crossing. As the city bad no crossing at Dale street,, the recommenda tion was that the proposition be accepted and the company notified to build the bridge. The report was adopted. An ordinance was parsed changing tue names of the following streets: Demy street in St. Anthony Park to Lang ford street: Pratt uvenue and Bay less av enue around Longford park to Longford Park Place: Aldin street and Langton street to Pratt avenue; Vane street, from the south line of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba road to Raymond street to bay less avenue; Vane street, from Raymond street to Ellis street and Hampden Place; also West street, in Hewitt's out lots, to Kayuiond avenue; Hampden avenue, from line of i lock 59, St. Antuony Park, to south line of Northern Pa cific, road, to Mature] street: Westward av enue. in St. Anthon.

Hope street to Fry street. The resolution passed at the last meeting, ordering the structure at 176 East Fifth street removed, was rescinded. Too chief of police was notified to cause all parties' whose busi ness requires a city license to secure one be fore Jan. 20, 1887. John Costello was ap pointed special policeman at the Robert street bridge at a salary of $40 per mouth. The report of the committee on streets rela tive to the paving of certain streets, a list of which has been recently published in the Glove, were sent to the board of public works to report as to the cost and advisability of the improvement. a."ui:s«..m is.vrs. "London Assurance" Cleverly Pro duced at Unity Club Kooni Laal Night--" IVtaite Slave" at the i and. An audience beyond the seating capacity of the house assembled in the Unity club room last evening to witness the perform ance of "London Assurance," a drama in five acts, by an amateur company composed of local talent. The play has a good plot, pleasing situations and plenty of room for a display of comedy qualities. As an ama teur performance it was fairly successful, and was produced with about as good effect as half of tlie dramatic perform ances that are given by profes sionals. The roles assumed by the three young ladies were interpreted with remark able ridel and correctness of conception. in some instances the Misses Long played their parts so admirably that they might have passed quite readily for the produc tions of professionals of high, ability. The two young ladies possess real histrionic tal ent, and if they are at all ambitious in the dramatic line they would be justified in giving full rein 'to their ambition. Miss Uosenwinkle assumed a more limited part, but did it most creditably. Ben Johnson carried the role of fair Ilatcourt Cently to perfection. He possesses what is of inesti mable value to an actor, perfect self-con trol, and is a good elocutionist. He had his lines so well committed that he never hesitated, which unfortunately was not the good luck of some of the other actors. With the exception of a few- slight breaks of this character and an 'occasional evidence of timidity, which is almost inherent to ama teur performances, the remainder of the cast got through their parts quite cleverly. The audience expressed its appreciation by frequent applauses, and the general ver dict was, "well done." An increased audience witnessed the "White Slave" last night at the Grand.

TRUSTEES OF ITI ACALESTER Preparing to Enlarge the College Buildincaa— Election of Officers— A Hanquet. The trustees of Macalester college held their annual meeting in the parlors of the West hotel, in Minneapolis, at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. There were present Alexander Ramsey, Henry L. Morse, Thomas Cochran, Jr.. H. K. Taylor, B. F. Wright and Robert P. Lewis, of St. Paul, Dr. Daniel Kice and Dr. McCurdy. of .Macalester, Capt. J. C. Whitney and W. M. Tenuy. of Minneapolis. A committee was appointed to frame proper resolutions upon the death of Dr. McFetridge, the pro fessor who died recently. 'Ihe committer on instruction was authorized to engage an instructor to take his place. The commit tee ou buildings was authorized to have plans prepared for the center portion of the college building, to cost $35,000, of which $10,000 is already subscribed. At present, the college occupies one wing, which was built two years ago. at a cost of $30,000. The original plan contemplates a central building with two wings.

FUTURE row THE TRANSFER. Great Warehouse* to Ue Kuilt Tbere --some. Important Laud Pur chases. In conversation yesterday on the subject of heavy switching charges by railroads, H. S. Fairchild foretold a great business future for the Minnesota Transfer. He said that the Minneapolis business men were complaining bitterly about transfer charges there, and the board of trade has already taken the matter in hand. While the railroad companies say the rates of transfer are lower in St. Paul and Minne apolis, still the aggregate charges to manu facturers, etc.. are enormous. Mr. Fair child says it is estimated that the Minneap olis mills alone pay $232,500 annually for transfer carges on freight. Add to this, he says, the amounts paid in the two cities by lumber men, wholesale houses and manu facturers, and see what an enormous total it makes. Continuing, he said: 1 have been thought visionary in my es timates as to the iuture value of the frontage of the Minnesota Transfer, but in the light of these facts who dares put a limit to their values? Elevators, mills, warehouses and manufactures must at no distant day crowd every foot of this Transfer frontaare, and the frontage of "horseshoes* - thrown out in every direction from the Transfer, and this district be the most active business center of the two Cities, and values reach a point never dreamed of b> those who have not given this matter consideration. Mr. Fairchild said that, apart from the saving of money by concentrating business at the Transfer, there was also a saving of time in the shipment of freight. As evi dencing the current of manufactures in that direction he gave the following pur chasers of property at the Transfer: D. C. shepherd and Mr. Dodge, of Minneapolis, an acre each on the east side of the Trans fer, each paying $4,000 per acre. The Mc- Cormacks, of Chicago, recently paid $5,000 for property on the othor side. J. M. Bohrer and the Spring Valley School Fur niture company each purchased an acre there for storage and manufacturing, pay ing $4,000 per acre. TO-DAY* WEATHER.

FROM FOREIGN FIELDS. Bulgaria Absolutely Declines to Accept ■ Prince Nicholas, of Mingrelia, as a Ruler, Th 6 Liberal Unionist Leaders Hold a Long and Harmonious Conference at London. They Resolve to Fight Gladstone and Ills Irish Policy to the End. Events In Ireland— The French Polit ical Crisis— General Foreign intelligence. Constantinople, Dec. 7.— The Porte has ; advised the Bulgarian regency to accept Prince Nicholas, of Mengrelia. as successor to Prince Alexander. The reason given Is that | his election is the only means to pacify Bul garia. The Porte admits that the regency : must maintain order, "but," it adds, ••so long as an opposing element exists which regards tho country's rests from a different point of view, the door is constantly open to event ualities.'" Sofia, Dec. 7.— The Bulgarian government j has replica to the porte that Bulgaria will never accept Prince Nicholas of Mengrelia. If the porte proposes a proper candidate the government will consider the question of new elections to the sobranje. Pesth. Dec. The Bulgarian deputation of notables arrived here to-day on their way to Vienna, and were accorded an ovation at the railway station by a great crowd. THE LIB*: Aa. UNIONISTS. They Hold a Conference and Decide to Continue tlae Tight Against Gladstone and Ireland. London, Dec. 6. — A conference of the Lib eral Unionists was held here to-day. Among the distinguished persons present were Earls Derby and Northbrock. Baron Rothschild, George J. Goschen, ex-Attorney General James and numerous noblemen. Letters of regret were read from Lord Tennyson, the Duke of Argyie and John Bright. John Bright said: "I do not attend, because I might say something which would give pain. 1 fear to speak or even write regarding Glad stone's course, which astonishes and great!}' pans me, especially his speech to theliish deputation which lately called upon him. It seems that 

GLADSTONE HAS GONE SO FAR in his wrong course that there is no hope of his return. I deplore and condemn such action, and if present might say something which would widen the breach. Gladstone s Irish allies are drivinir matters to an extrem ity and yet no word comes from Panel] or Gladstone to restrain them." Chamberlain wrote: here is no hope of reuniting the Liberal party unless the Glad stone scheme of Irish government is aban doned." LorJ Hartington in bis address to the con vention said the policy which Gladstone ad vocated was directly opposed to the opinions of the entire Liberal party and even all the principles under him. The Liberal Unionists were as true exponents of Liberal principles as were the majorit. who followed Gladstone, and in maintaining the supremacy of the imperial parliament were better representa tives of those principles. Their association was formed. Lord Hartington continued, to preserve the character of its members as Unionist Libera s and by organization they had achieved a success wuich would have been impracticable otherwise, and bad only been achieved after organization by the formation of an alliance with the Conserva tives. Siege would be laid to Gladstone's po sition, which had not been taken b. storm, and the liberal Unionists would have to work until either they were deieated or had ob tained a more decisive victory. The time had not yet arrived when a line of action in . parliament could be laid down. The Liberal Unionists must depend for their J. \ 

LINE OF PARLIAMENTARY POLICY upon the action of the government. The speaker believed there would be found no difficulty on the main point of the main tenee of the union. The present conference would prove to the Liberal Unionists every where tbat they are acting with the full sup port of the liberal opinion in the party. Gladstone, Sir William Vernon Hareourt and uOhn Morley based their speeches upon grant ing Ireland an executive government, but all ignored the arguments of the Liberal Union ists against such a policy. Gladstone as sumed that the government is competing with him in his scheme for Ireland, but the government is opposed to anything of the kind. The removal of the present govern ment would result In the election of Glad stone, who would settle tho Irish question in his own way. We must al ways remember this when questions arise which might result in displacing the government. The Liberal Unionists are in terested In sustaining the government. Ques tions had arisen, which gave the Conserva tives a common interest witb a section of the Liberals and would force them to adopt some reforms necessary to maintain the union between the government and the Liberal Unionists. The question of municipal re form, lor instance, was one which the Union ists should give the government an opportu nity to consider. Referring to the situation in Ireland Lord Hartington said the present anti-rent agitation was not spontaneous, lt had been created lor political purposes and was simply anarchy. If 

SPEECHES LlkE JOHN DILLON'S were not checked the result must be the sub version of every principle of liberty in Ireland. "We are told." said the speaker, "that the English democracy will not stand these evictions, but I think the English democracy will a*k who is responsible for them. "Gladstone," added Lord Huntington, "may not be able to con trol John Dillon, but Gladstone can speak one word which will dissolve the alliance be tween the agitators of Dillon's cause and tbe Liberal party. The English people are awaiting that word, which, if delayed will se riousl.. endanger the good name of the Lib eral part ." [Great cheering.] Earl Ski borne moved that the conference affirm its determination to make ever* effort to uphold the uuion. The resolution was adopted b» acclamation. The Duke of Westminster moved and Heue-ige seconded a resolution to establish ', a Liberal-Unionist association throughout -Great Britain. At the banquet this evening 4011 guests were present. Mr. Goschen made a speech. London, Dec. B.— The Standard says that the action of tbe Unionist conference yester day is a decisive confirmation of the belief that the government can abso.utely rel • upon the support of the Unionists in the imme diate suppression of anarchy iv Ireland.

D blin, Dec. 7. — Members of Gen. But ler's staff have promised the evicted tenants of Castle Island to intercede in tbeir behalf.
