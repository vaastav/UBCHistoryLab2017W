"8alling southeasterly along the shore of that haunt of the walrus and polar bear. St Matthew's island, in the Be ring sea, said a navigator of those waters, "one is impressed by the mingling of the grotesque and the ter rible in the character of the scenery. The northwest point of the Island is split up Into a collection of large rocks of most fantastic shapes. Houses, spires, cathedrals and figures of men and beasts are some of the forms as sumed by these volcanic fragments, which, rising black above the white, seething foam of the seat that breaks against their base, give a weird aspect to the grim and desolate region. One rock resembling a large saddle sug gested to me the thought that some antediluvian giant might in his time have straddled it and perhap fished lot reptilia over the beetling cliffs .which It eurmounta." . Be a "Good Fellow:' The Palladium is in a position to know who the deserving poor fami lies of Richmond are and Is only too willing to supply a list of one or more of these families to any "good fellow" who makes application. It la then up to him to personally bring Christmas cheer to the hearts of those intrusted to his charity. Wre will wager that any "good fellow aft er he has experienced that joy of giving to the destitute and weary will apply again to the Palladium for the names of more deserving families. To aid the poor through some charitable organization is splendid, but the joy one obtains from this kind of charity is indirect. To give directly to some unfortunates who need your helping hand is the essence of pleasure obtainable from a noble and unselfish act. Write to the Palladium for the names of deserving poor families or call at this office for the same, then play Santa Claus to them. They will not prove unappreciative, and you will have the happiest Christmas of your life, because you will be pleased with yourself. Ask any man who has made a Christmas pilgrimage with the Elks if this is not true. P. Morgan and Peace J. Pierpont Morgan is quoted by Baroness Von Stuttner of Vienna, bead of the European peace movement, as saying he had no Interest in world's peace and would no nothing to further such a movement. If Mr. Morgan has been quoted correctly much importance should be attached to his frank statement for his interests stretch throughout the globe and the game he plays is so big that his movements and opinions are of vital interest to the chancelorles of all the world powers. He finan ces bankrupt nations and controls markets frem Hong Kong to New York. But it is no surprise if Mr. Morgan is not interested in maintaining world's peace. Big Business the world over does not advocate peace and Mr. Morgan Is the Napoleon of Big Business. Less than a hundred years ago war was made by rulers of natfons to avenge -petty grievances or for territorial expansion. Today the order of things has changed. Most rulers are puppets and the czars of finance and commerce are the real warmak rs. Big Business in Russia coveted a Chinese port with open water the year round and forced a war with Japan which resulted in humiliation and disaster to the Russian people, but the Japanese business men gloat ed, for it gave them the rich Korean trade. Today one sees the Balkan nations gnawing at the throat of Turkey principally because the allies desired to expand their commercial activi ties. Servia, surrounded on all sides by the high tariff walls of Austria, Montenegro, Roumania and Bulgaria, wanted a port of her own on the Adriatic. She has it now and says she will hold it despite the threats of Austrian Big Business. Bulgaria will have a southern port so that her com merce will not be forced to pass the fortress guarded Dardanelles; Monte negro will acquire some rich agriculture land and Greece will have new territory to stimulate her trade. National Defense. President Taft, In his latest message to congress strongly advocates serious consideration of the question of national defense", but fails to sug gest very definite plans for carrying out this program. American citizens have the self assurance natural to the Anglo Sax on race and are so sublimely confident of their ability to "whip" any foe who has the audacity to attack them that military affairs have been abso lutely ignored and our people have been devoting all their energies to commercial pursuits. But through our national activity in trade and com merce we are constantly exposed to the danger of war with some power ful rival commercial nation. This country has ignored the fact that re cent wars have been brought on through trade expansion, and all the great commercial nations, save the United States, are constantly prepared to support their commerce with effective military organizations. It is not necessary for the United States to become a great military nation, but it is criminal to further neglect our national defense. The most influential newspapers in the country have finally realized this fact and have joined hands in the work of arousing the people to the danger they are constantly exposed to. Like Great Britain this country's strength is sea power. We have, un til the last two years, maintained a powerful fleet, but there Is now a tendency to weaken the navy. Every patriotic American should protest against such a dangerous and false economical policy. Behind a strong battle fleet there should be improved harbor defens es and a reorganized army. There are about 85,000 men in the regular army but only 35,000 are stationed in continental United States, and these men are scattered about the country in companies, battalions and regi ments, a relic of the system employed during the period of Indian troub les. One-half of the army posts in the United States should be abandoned and the regular army concentrated in brigades and divisions so in the event of hostilities they could be mobilized promptly and form an effective nucleus for an army which naturally would be composed for the most part of national guardsmen and volunteers. It Is also important that the National Guard be reorganized and en couraged by federal assistance. The needs of the National Guard are set forth in the following sec tion of President Taft's message: Under existing law the national guard constitutes, after the regular army, the first line of national defense. Its organization, discipline, train ing and equipment under recent legislation have been assimilated, as far as possible, to those of the regular army, and its practical efficiency under present conditions have reached a stage of development beyond which they cannot reasonably be asked to go without further direct assistance in the form of pay from the federal government. On the other hand, such pay from the national treasury would not be justified unless it produced a proper equivalent in additional efficiency on the part of the national guard. The organized militia today cannot be ordered outside of the limits of the United States and thus cannot lawfully be used for general mili tary purposes. The officers and men are ambitious and eager to make themselves thus available and to bcome an efficient national reserve of citizen soldiery. They are the only force of trained men other than the regular army upon which we can rely. The so-called militia pay bill in the form agreed on between the authorities of the war department and the representatives of the national guard, in my opinion, adequately meets these conditions and offers a proper return for the pay which it is proposed to give to the national guard. I believe that its enactment into law would be a very long stap to ward providing this nation with a first line of citizen soldiery, upon which its main reliance must depend In case of any national emergency. Plans for the organization of the national guard into tactical divisions on the same lines as those adopted for the regular army are being formulated by the war college division of the general staff.
