Elbkwhibk we publish an interview had by a reporter of the New York Tribune with Hon. J. I. C. Atkins, Representative in Congress from tLe 8th district of Tennessee, some of the statements of which will attract attention. Mr. . Atkins may be re garded as (he leading DeniocM-at in. OoDgress from Tennessee. He served during the last Congress as chair man of the committee on appropna - . - i a .,f ! lion, ma uiusii imiiuiLtiuL ci n House committees, save one that of ways and means, ileis a geuueman ; of acknowledged ability, and has al- j ways stood high in his party. . He is j a gentleman of education, having graduated from the university of Tennessee. He has had large in fluence in public afi'airp, and what he says is entitled to much more weight than what is said by the average politician. . , This being true, his utterances on the State debt question will be re ceived with astonishment. He is in favor of repealing the law passed at the last session of the Legislature for the settlement of the State debt, and why ? Is it because he believed the law is wrong ? It cannot be that, for he says he ha9 hitherto stood for maintaining the faith and. credit of the State and paying every dollar she owes. He virtually acknowledges the validity of jthe debt, for. he says he is willing to pay 50 per cent, of the principle and 4 per cent, interest. If it is an illegal debt, certainly he would not favor paying any part of it. U we believed the debt to be il legal we would vote against paying $ dollar of it But what reason does ho give? Hear it all ye people, who have look ed upon Congressman Atkins as a great man and a statesman. Why, he says, the readjuters having suc ceeded in Virginia the State credit Pemocrats in Tennesse are " sadly demoralized " and therefore he is in clined to support the 50-4 proposi tion, a proposition which was voted down by the people only a short time ago by an over whelmyig majority, He says the Republicans of Tennessee will op pose any such a proposition, and a great many State credit Democrats will vote with them, and appears to think the Democrats will bd beaten as usual. Well, we must think Congressman Atk'ns is himself fear fully demoralized. ; When a man who aspires to the rank of statesmanship i gives so flirney a reason for changing j his views onlso impertant a question, ., , , . , r jt argues a state of demoralization t 4 ! trnly pitiable. Because the readjust-1 ers succeeded in Virginia, he will j turn readjnster himself. Because j his rmrtr i dmnri7a on a r.- i A tion which its leaders have been say ing for more than ten years tbat they were gcing to settle, and have not settled et, he consents to Le de moralized himself. And as, accord ing to his view, his party is on the run like a drove of frightened Texas attle, he will ran with the others, notwithstanding he admits that they nre "doomed" to land in political per dition.

The meseage, in a word, is full of views, and the views are not pretended to be the views cf the country, or even of a parly, bjit only the personal opinions of the author of the message, which are to be taken, as the savin; ip, for what they are j worth. New Y'ork World. I The style of the meesage, it may be edded, is exceedingly unpreten tious and utterly devoid of rhetorical flourishes or mere writing for effect. It is not probable that it will take rank with the effusions of a higher order of statesmanship, but it will be recognized as the production of at least a tolerably clear-headed and eonmionssense matter of fact man of business. Commercial Bulletin'. President Arthur's- first annual message will stand with the best of n'nety-one which have been made by his predocessors. Presidential mes sages have lately come to be mere summaries of department reports. President Arthur's iu not, and he has thrown about the entire instrument a dignified consciousness of his posi tion ag the head of a great nation, which is commendable as it is rare in these annual State papers. Right or wrong in his recommendations he is nowhere commonplace j and in dealing with the foreign relations of the Government, a topic on which his predecessors have been too often either barren or blundering, Pres ident Arthur is at once suggestive and felicitous. Philadelphia Press. (Rep.) Whatever may have been the past opinions of men as to the capacity, the fitness, the partisanship of Lr. Arthur, it must be allowed that a man who can thus, coming from what is regarded as the extremest wing of his party, catch the spirit of the times, adapt himself practically to the prevailing sentiment of "the country, seize upon and present its I leaclmg themes and the points up- ; permost in the public mind, has in the act given indications of possess ing tbat practical statesmanship j which is now so much needed. ! When this is the case, considering it as an established truth that the CQuniry is more interested in what it receives than in the ciue.tion from whom it may receive it, carping, and narrow partisan criticism would be ou' PJace- - ; Thorough d'scusnon is an essen- i , . . a , . , tial element to f ecunng the best pol- icVf aU(i part- differences and criti- cism must and ehoull continue, AYhen this country ceases to have its MSt lines OI progress WOTKea 0HP through party it will cease to have free discussion and caase to be free. We do not agree with all Mr. Arthur says, nor as to . what we accept do we agree in detail in all things -, but his suggestions are so entirely to the practical business sense of the coun try that partisan criticism is dis armed and his suggestions must be tried calmly upon their merits. Nashville American. - Presidedent Arthur's first message is on the whole a very creditable paper. The number of topics it has become the custom to mention in a President's mesEage is so large that it would be unjust to complain of the length of the document. Presi dent Arthur has contrived to say something of .value on a, great many of them, and to dismiss others with out expressing an opinion, but also without great - waste of words. With . regard to most subjects he summarizes the reports of the differ ent secretaries. " He recommentfs an increase of the army and the build ing of a navy. 'He . sets forth the savings made in the postal service UMid urges a vigorous prosecution of those chargeable with the Star rcrate frauds. He ' approves v the Indian policy which has been advocated in President's messages and', depart ment rcpoils- lor several years, and recommends the legislation necessary to give it general effect. But the most interesting parts of the message aro unquestionably those vhieh refer to our foreign relations, to our finan- : ciai policy, and to tbe civil service. Upon the subject of civil service refcr-m the President has evidently bestowed much consideration. He j recognizes the existence of great evils in the ww prevailing system, and tho necessity of a reform. Ho points out iu tue clear and forcible language of his letter of acceptance to what objects that reform should be diree'ed. "Original appointments should be based upon ascertained fitness; the tenure of ofiice should bo stable ; positions of responsibil ity should, so far .as practicable, be tilled by the promotion of worthy and efficient officers." As to the method by which "fitness" is to be ascertained, President Arthur admits that the system of competitive exam inations as carried on in Great Brit ain has produced very Fatisfactory re&ults ; but he adds that it is cou pled there with certain features, such as life tenure, a limitation of the maximum age at which an applicant cau enter the service, and a system of pensions, which would not be re ceived with favor in this country. Admitting this for argument's sake, then the fact would ttill remain a fuct which is also recognized by the President that competitive exami nations have been carried on with excellent results also in this country, as in the New York custom house and other places, without being coupled with such features, and the President gives no reason why they should not be continued end extends ed over a large rpart of the service in the Bhape already tested. The problem is' to put a "system of ap pointment bast d upon ascertained merit in. the place of a system of appointment by favor. While the President acknowledges the necessi ty of this, and expresses at the same time some doubt as to competitive examinations,, he does not suggest any other method which he considers more practicable. But he promises j his concurrence and faithful support ' if Congress should pass a law estab j lishing competitive tests, which, un I der the ciicum stances, is all that ; could have been expected. The i President's r.tterances on the civil service are not only valuable for the j suggestions they contain, but as a j sure sign that this subject has taken ! too firm a hold upon tli6 attention of I the American people to be dismissed with mere unmeaning phrases. ! On the whole it may be said that j President Arthur's message deserves, i and if we may judge from the ex i preesions of opinion we have seen has had, a respectful and even hearty I reception from tbe American people. !
