WHAT IS THOUGHT OF CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE. Congressmen and Senators Chary in Their Talk About the Paper. Comment of Leading Eastern and Foreign Newspapers. Praised by Some and Criticised by Others—A Document Which De serves and Doubtless Will Obtain a Serious Study of the European Powers - While It Will Excite Bitterness in Spain, She nust Hake Up Her flind to Listen to Friendly Counsel. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Neither the House nor the Senate had a good op portunity of judging the President's massage by the public reading of it. Representatives and Senators were chary in their comments. Congressman Grosvenor thinks the Cuban and other foreign matters will not be satisfactory to those who have so earnestly hoped for the early action of our country In the interest of an early cessation of the wholesale murder in the unhappy island of Cuba. Francis G. Newlands of Nevada said that the remedy for financial Ills pro posed by the President, namely, the re tirement of the greenbacks and the substitution of national bank notes, would not give relief. Mr. Loud of California: "The posi tion of the President on Cuban affairs should receive the commendation of all Americans. It Is dignified, yet it is sufficiently aggressive to intimate to Spain that this country is anxiously watching the events In Cuba, with the hope that further effusion of blood and needless loss of property may be pre vented in some honorable manner with out outside intervention." Speaker Reed said: "It seems hardly necessary to comment upon the mes sage. It is calm in tone, and on the Cuban question will be much more sat isfactory to the country than It would have been a year ago." NEW 

YORK PRESS. NEW" YORK, Dec. 7.—Commenting on President Cleveland's message the leading papers will to-morrow say: The "Sun": The Cuban matter Is clearly written In a style differing con spicuously from that of the opening and closing paragraphs of the message. Its statements and suggestions hold the attention closely until you come to the disheartening conclusion. In well bal anced periods, sympathy for the strug gling patriots and friendship and ad miration for Spain are equally dis penamdL With the happy consciousness of having unloaded everything, this wonderful statesman winds up hi 3 last : '-age to Congress with a beautiful trlbsate to himself. "When our differ ences are forgotten and our contests of political opinion are no longer remem bered, nothing In the retrospect of our public service will be as fortunate and comforting as the recollection of official duty well performed and the memory of constant devotion to the interests of our confiding fellow countrymen." His confiding fellow countrymen will not doubt that the final paragraph at least is Mr. Cleveland's own. Only two men who ever lived could have written it, and Mr. Pecksniff Is dead. The "Times": Mr. Cleveland makes a singularly clear statement of the pres ent situation and of the course of events that has produced it. The "Tribune": It is now more than twelve years since Cleveland by his nomination against Mr. Blame became the unquestioned leader of a great na tional party. To him it is largely due that a disastrous change in the tariff has been effected, and but for him the effort of that party to debase the na tional currency and tarnish the nation al honor might have prevailed. The "Herald": President Cleveland not- ■ that affairs in Cuba are worse than they were a year ago; that Spain baa not succeeded in establishing her from itching and hamine eczema* and other ak:n and acalp torture*. None but parent* real lze how them- little one* suffer. To know that a> warm bath with Cuticcra Soap, and a eintfk application of (Xticcra (ointment), the pre;;: akin cure, will in the majority of

The "Journal": The space which President Cleveland devotes to the re ciprocal relations of Cuba, Spain and the United States in his last message to Congress Indicates that he is not wholly Insensible to the agitation of the ques tion which has long progressed in this country. But his conclusions show be yond a doubt that he will leave to his successor the honor of taking the first step to assure Cuban liberty. 

LONDON PRESS COMMENT. LONDON, Dec. 7.—The "Standard" to-morrow will say,in commenting on the President's message: It is dignified and full of common sense. It deserves and doubtless will obtain the serious study of the European Powers. The "Stand ard" is of the opinion that the message will excite bitterness in Spain, who, nevertheless, must make up her mind to listen to friendly counsel. Spaniards may be excused if they detect a tone of menace. The oondition of Cuba will certainly not induce impartial observ ers to say that menace is unwarranted. The paper dwells on Mr. Cleveland's pointed reassertion of the Monroe doc trine in the paragraph reading: What ever circumstances may arise, our pol icy and our interests would constrain us to object to the acquisition of the island or any Interference with its con trol by any European Power. It sees in this the intention of the United States to claim a virtual pro tectorate over the continent and the is lands thereof. This, it adds, is a large and bold policy that is not quite free from danger, as Spain is not the only power with which the United States might thereby become embroiled. The paper expresses the opinion that if Spain found a powerful friend in Europe to help prevent Cuba from passing from her hands, the objection of the United States, based on the Monroe doctrine, would not be of much account. For tunately, there seems to be no real risk that the Monroe doctrine will cause further disputes with Great Britain. In conclusion, the "Standard" refers to the passages referring to the passing of the Venezuelan dispute, and says that the dignified language of the mes sage where it refers to Turkey shows the Powers that they can be assured of the cordial support of the United States in executing corrective measures in that country.. The "Daily News" Is chiefly impressed by the section of the message referring to Cuba. It admits that the Americans cannot be permanently Indifferent to the disastrous war, but says that while the intentions of President Cleveland and Secretary Olney may be ever so good, European opinion is not favorable to the latest version of the Monroe doc trine, and Spain will have some influen tial support if she holds out for it. The "Chronicle" will say In a leader on the same subject hat the alternative before Spain is really to either satisfy the Cubans or have Cuba taken from her forcibly. In conclusion the paper says: "We advise Spain in her own interest to sell Cuba quickly, but he would be no friend of the United States who would advise the latter to buy the island." 

UTAH ELECTION. The State Board Enjoined From Can vassing the Returns. SALT LAKE (Utah), Dec. 7.—When the State Board of Canvassers met this morning for the purpose of making the official canvass of the votes cast at the recent election they were served with an injunction issued by the State Su preme Court, enjoining them from mak ing the canvass or issuing the certifi cates of election to the successful can didates. The injunction was issued on the pe tition of M. L. Ritchie, one of the Judges of the Third Judicial District, who sets up in his petition that the election held on November 3d is null and no account, for the reason that the Act of the Legis'ature authorizing it was not legally p ssed, and the ballot was not secret, as according to the Con stitution it ought to have been. It is claimed that the entire election is void, and that the present State and county officers hold over until the next regular election. The hearing of argument on the pe tition is set for Friday next, when It will be decided whether or not the In junction will be made permanent. Senator Arthur Brown is the leading counsel for the petitioners. LOS

HIGH WATERS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. Second Flood Visitation Fully as Great in Extent as That in November. Rivers Emptying Into the Sound Reach an Appalling Hight. A San Francisco Cook Lured Down to the Wharves by Two Unknown Ruffians, Who Cut His Throat, Rifled His Pockets and Threw Him Into the Bay—An Attempted Mur der at Los Angeles. SEATTLE (Wash.), Dec 7.—ln its second flood visitation the Pacific Northwest is suffering to fully as great an extent as during the disastrous No vember storms. To-day the mad waters of many rivers emptying into Puget Sound from the north and east reached an appalling night. Between Friday and Monday morning all the railroad bridges which were reconstructed, and the trackage rebuilt during the latter days ot last month, were again swept away. The Snohomish River between Snohomish City and Everett Is six miles wide. The Great Northern tracks be tween Sultan City and Everett are in undated to a depth of from two to five feet, and three big bridges over the Skykomish River in the Cascades were swept away. The Skykomish River is a raging torrent, running in many places like a mill race. The Everett and Monte Cristo road is almost a to tal wreck, and it is only with the great est difficulty that food supplies are to be had at Monte Cristo and the neigh boring towns. Nearer Seattle, in the fertile valleys of Duwamish, White Green and Puy allup, great damage is being done to private property. The tides backing up the Duwamish River are forcing the waters through the dykes and out over the lowlands. The Northern Pacific and Great Northern roads are still un able to operate the main lines from Seattle. RACES AT INGLESIDE. Four Favorites Home in Front in Yes terday's Events.

Ills attorneys asked the court to withdraw its recent order pre venting them from filing their brief on appeal, and continued the whole mat ter for two weeks, when the request will probably be granted. It was agreed that on the filing of the Attorney-Gen eral's brief ten days additional should be given them to file a reply brief. When the case finally comes before the court a long time will be taken for its consideration, so that many months will elapse before it will be known whether Dun-ant Is to be retried.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.—John Van Aiken, a cook employed in the Em porium Building Restaurant, was lured down to the wharf at the foot of Bat tery street to-night by two unknown ruffians, who cut his throat, rifled his pockets and threw him into the bay.
