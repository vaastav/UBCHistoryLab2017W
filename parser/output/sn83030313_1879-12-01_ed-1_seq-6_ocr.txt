6 PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. ' Prosperity at Home and Peace Abroad. 9 no financial legislation wanted. A?. Civil Service, Polygamy and the Indian Policy Reviewed. OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS, j The President's Message, which will be laid beforo the two houses of Cougress to-day, deals with all tbo 1 important questions likely to engage the attention of the national legislature. At tlic very outset of hia > Message the President congratulates Congress ou the ' successful execution of the resumption act, and J status that the excess of the precious metals dopos- ; iUd or exchanged for United States notes over tho amount of United States notes redeemed is about $lu.ooo,oou. He then adverts to the revival of i business and tho marked improvement in the public credit. From July 1 to November 15 tho balance of trade in our favor was about $50,000,000. Speaking of the salo of four per cent United States bonds he says they have been disposed of at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay oil all the national debt which was redeemable under present lawa. The amount of interest saved annually by the process of refunding tho debt since March 1, 1877, is $14.2?7,177. The amount of the nationaj debt which matures within less thou two years Is $7!>2,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent, and the balance is in bonds bearing C per cent interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of 4 per cent bonds, and by the reduction of inter, est which will thus be effected, about $11,000,000 can be annually saved to the Treasury. To Hecure this important reduction ot interest to be paid by the United States further legislation is required, which, it is hoped, will be provided by Congress during its present session. 

KQUAL1TY OF GOLD AMD SILVER. The coinage of gold by the'mints of tBe United States during the last fiscal year was $40,'J8C,!H2. The coinage of silver dollars since the passage of the act for that purpose up to November 1, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury and are now in circulation, and $32,300,506 are still in the possession of the government. After stating these figures and refer, ring to the efforts of commercial nations of Europe to effect a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world. me iresiueui recomineuus mat ^ou^ress reiruin from new legislation on the subject. He j ays tlie groat revival of trade, internal and I foreign, will supply, during tiie coming year, ! Its own instructions, which may well be i 1 awaited before attempting further experimental measures with the coinage. I would, however, lirongly urge upon Congress the importance of tuthorizing tho Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon tho present legal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar . being uniformly and largely less than tho market 1 value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin 1 is forced into circulation it will, if coined without , limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and | thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency ot both gold and silver, which shall be of equlv- . aleut value, dollar for dollar, with tho universally recognized money of the world. llKTIltEMKNT OF (iH??SBACK8. The retirement from circulation of United States Dotes, with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be takeu in our progress toward a safo and stable currency, which should bo ccepted a the policy and duty of tho government Mid tho interest and security of tho people. It is my firm conviction that tho issue of legal tender paper money, based wholly upon the authority and credit of the government, except m extreme emergency, is . without warrant in tlie constitution and a violation of sound llnaucial principles. Xlie issue of United States notes during the lato civil war, with the ca- i pacity of legal tender between privato individuals, > was not authorized except as a means 01 rescuing J the country from imminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money lor any protracted period of tinio utter the accomplishment of this purpose was not contemplated by tho framers o: the law under which they were issued. They anticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicab e period consistent with the attainment ot the object tor which they were provided. Tho policy of tho United States, steadily adnered to from the adoption of the constitution, his been to avoid the creation ot a national debt, and when, from necessity, in the time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly as possible. With this view and for this purpose it is recommended that the existing laws for tho accumulation of a sinking fund sutttcient to extinguish the public debt ! within a limited period be maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has shown that a duty can be placed ou tea and eotl'ee which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer and which will add severs! millions of dollars annually to the Treasury. 

UTAH AND POLYGAMY. Tho ad.nission of the Territory of Utah iuto the Union as a State is recommended, but the President says:?"This important change will uot be approved by the country while tho oiti/eus ot Utah, in very consideraole number, uphold a practice which is Sondeiuned as acrinie by the laws of all civilized com- ' muuities throughout the world." A stricter enforcement of the law prohibiting polygamy is commended j to every department of the government, and if i necessary to secure obedience he says:?"The en- 1 Joymeiit and exercise of the rights and privileges of 1 citizenship in the Territories of the United States may be withheld or withdrawn from those who \ violate or oppose the cnlorcement of tho law on this 1 subject." THE HltlHT OF SirprUAIlK. The elections 01 the vast year, though occupied ! only with State ollici s, have not failed to elicit, in the political discussions which attended them all | over the country, new and decisive evidence ot tho deep interest which the groat body of citizens taUo . in the progress ot the country toward a more general sua complete establishment, at whatever cost, of j c universal security and freedom in the exercise ot tho tleetive Iraocliibo. Wink many topics of political , concern demand nrc.it attention from our people, 0 both in the sphere of national and State authority, j| l.tind uo reasou to nu.ility tin: opinion 1 expressed ,| in my lest annu.d Message, that no temporary or n adiumiati alive Interest* of KOVurumeiit, how- ^ evur urgent or weighty, will ever display tho neal of our people m deteneo of tho primary rl?litn 1; of cltixeuahip, anil tiiat tho power 01 public opin- t ion will override nil political prejudice ft and all fl * ctional and Statu attach men ts, lu demanding p that all over our wide territory tho iiutuu ?ntl character of cillMn of tlie United States shall iii'an ono and the same tiling ?ud carry with them unchallenged security nnd respect.

CIVIL RUV1CC. 1 Tho Preaideut transmits to Congiusx the report of tlie Civil Service Commission. 'J lie report, he Myi, sets forth tho history ot the partisan spoils system n In (ircnt Itritam and of tho rlxu and tall ot the par- < liameiitary patrouage, and of official interierence i with the ireedom of elections. It shows that, alter i long trials of various kinds of examinations, those i which are competitive and open on eijtial terms to all, and which are carried on under the mperln1 tendeiice o' a single commission, have, with gre it advantage, been established ax conditions of autiilssion to almost every official place in tho nubordi* naie administration of that country and ot Uriti.->h India. As rcganis the civil service tlie Mosmtge contains nothing now, either in argument or lu the recommendations to Congress. Competitive examinations, tho President remarks, under many embarrassments, hive been conducted, within limited apheres, In the executivo department* in Washington and in a number ot the custom houses and post offices of tliu principal eitle* of tho country, with a view to further text their ell acts, j nnil in every instance they have been found to bo i salutary. The economy, pnrlty and elUi iencjr of tho i public service would be gr at.y promoted by their I systematic introduction, wbeiuvtr piaoticaUu, i I NEW YOKE throughout the entire civil service of the government. together with ample provision tor tht'ir general supervision, ill oritur to secure consistency and uniform justice. Ki-ports trout the Sec-rotary of the Interior, iroiu the l'ostmaster General, truiii the i'ostuiaster iu the city of New York, where such examinations have been some time ou trial, and also rroiu the Collector of the fort, the Naval Officer and the Surveyor iu that city and from the postmasters au<l collectors in several of the other largv cities, show that the competitive ttvsteni where applied has iu various way* contributed to improve the public service. The reports show that the results have beuu salutary iu a marked decree and that the general applicatiou of similar rules canuot fail to bu of decided benetit to the service. The reports of the goveruiueut officers iu the city of New York especially bear decided testimony to the utility of opeu competitive examinations in tlieir respective offices, showing that "these examinations and the excellent qualification* ot those admitted to the service through them have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service, and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There ha* been, on the part of these latter, ail Increased interest in the w*>rk and a desire to i xteud acquaintance witli it beyond a particular desk, ana thus the moralo of the entire fqree has becu raised. The examinations have been atteuded by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope aud character of the tests and the method of determiuing the results, and those visitors have without exception approved the modes employed, and several of theiu have publicly attested their favorable opinion upon such considerations." POLITICAL LEVIES FOB PA11TY PURPOSES. In closing his discussion of the civil service quel tion tb President declares that, in whatever aspect considered, the practice of making levies (or party purposes upon tho salaries or officers is hiehly demoralizing to the public service and discreditable to the country. Though uu officer should be aa tree as any other citizen to give bib own money in aid of his opinions or hia party he should ulao be at Moo na any other citizen to refuse to luake such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the officers it is gross injustice to levy a tax upou them, if they are made excessive in order that they may bear the tax tho excess la an indirect robbery of the public funds, lie, therefore, recommends such a revision and extension of present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public employment the protection with which a great and enlightened nation should guard those who are faithful in its service. OUK FOllKIUN 11KJLATIONS. Relations with Austria, ltussia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey aud Belgium continue amicable aud marked by no incident of especial importance. With the German Empire frequent questions I'.rise in connection with the subject of naturalization and expatriation, but the imperial government has constantly manifested a desire to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty stipulations in regard to them. Some questions with Switzerland in regard to pauper and convict emigrants have arisen, but it is not doubted that they will be arranged upon a just and satisfactory basis. The questions ot grave importance with Spain, growing out of the incidents of the Cuban insurrection, have leen, tor the most part, happily aud honorably settled. The treaty recently made between Japan and the United States, in regard to the revision of former treaties, it is now believed will be followed by similar action on the part of other treaty Powers. The government of China has signified its willingness to consider tlin question of the emigration of its subjects to the United States with a dispassionate fairness, aud to co-operate in such measures as may teud to prevent injurious consequences to the United Stales. The negotiations are still proceeding and will be pressed with diligence. THE FORTUNE HAY MATTER. The United StateB Minister in London has been instructed to present a demand for $ll)5,3Uo 02, in view of the damages received by Americau citizens ut Fortune llay on the tith day of January, 1878. The subject haa been taken into consideration by the British government and an early reply is anticipated. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary examination the subject of our participation in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at once be brought to the attention of the British government, with a view to an early and permanent settlement of the whole question, which was only temporarily adjusted by the Treaty of Washington. Efforts have beeu made to obtain the removal of restrictions found injurious to the exportation of cattle to the United Kingdom. Some correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and property upon the lakes, which has resulted in important modifications of the previous regulations of the Dominion government ou tho subject in the interest of humanity and commerce. .In accordance with the joint resolution of the lust session of Congress Commissioners were appointed to represent the United States at the two international exhibitions in Australia, one of which is now in progress at Sydney mid the otlier to be held next year at Melbourne. A lesire has been expressed by our merchants and manufacturers interested in the important and {rowing trade with Australia that an increased provision should be made by Congress for the representation of our induHtries at tlie Melbourne Exhibition of next year, and the subject is respectfully submitted to your favorable consideration. TIIK NKW FUKNCH CAUI.E. The assent of tlie government has been givon to tbe landing 011 the coast of Massachusetts 01 a new and independent transatlantic cable between France, by way of the French island of St. Piorre, ai.d this country, subject to any future legislation of Congress on tlie subject. Tlie conditions imposed, bolore allowing this connection with our shores to be established, are such as to secure its competition with any existing or future lines of mariue cable and preclude amalgamation therewith. To provide for entire equality ot rights to our government and people with those of Frauce in the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusivo possession of the privilege as accorded by France to the disadvantage of any Future cable communication between France and the United States which may be projected and accomplished by our citizens, an important reduction of the present rates of cable communication with Lufope, felt to bo too burdonsome to the interests ot our commerce, must nocessarily flow from tho istabiisliment ot this competing line. TRADE WITH IU1\/IL. Cordial relations continue with Brazil and the irge litine Uepublic, and trade with those countries s improving. A provision for regular and more trejuent mail communication in our own ships, be.ween the ports ot this country and the nations of iouth America, seems to me to deserve the attention )l Congress as an essential precursor of an enlargenent of our commerce with them and an cxteusion >f our carrying trade. THE NICARAGUA CANAL. Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again tilly restored by the arrival of a Minister from that ouutry to the United States. This is especially lorunate, in view of tlie fact that the question of an nturoceanic canal has recently assumed a new and mportaiit aspect and is now under discussion with he Central American countries, through whose territory the canal by tho Xicarauga route would have o pass. It is trusted that enlightened statosmanliip on their part will see that the early prosecuion of such a work will largely inure to ho benettt, not only of their own citizens ml those ot the United States, but of ho commerce o! the civilizod world. It s not doubted that, should the work bo tinderaken under the protective auspices of the United Itates, aud upon satlsiuctory concessions for tho ight of way and its security by the Central Amerian governments, tho capital for its completion rould be readily furnished from this country and Europe which mit;ht, tailing such guarantees, prove u accessible. BORDKU RAIDS STOPPED. Through tho judicious nu t energetic action of tho nilitary commanders of the two nations on each I ide of tlie Kio Jrando. under the instructions of ; heir resDectivu governments, raids and depredations < tave grsatly decreased, and in the localities where ' ormerly most destructive have now almost wholly | eased. In view of this result the I'residont outer- l ains confident expectation that tho continuance of ! he prevalence of quiet on the border wiil soon booine so assured as to justify a modification of tho rousing tho border, without encouraging hucU cliaurbauces uti would endanger tho peace of tho two uun tries.

I'AY or t'mtku STATRS MARSHALS. The report of the Secretary ot tho Treasury, | ilri ady published, and of tho Secretaries ot War nud ( if the Navy aud tho Postm 'ster General's report, ' tre briefly summarized. In regard to the Department of Justice the President calls tho attention of Uongress to tiie (set that at the last session no nppropriattou whatever was made tor tho payment of the lees of marshals and tlieir deputies, either in the servico of process or for the discharge of other duties, Mid stneo June 30 those officers liavo continued the performance of their duties without compensation from the government, taking upon themselves the necessary incidental outlays as well as rendering their own services, lu only a low unavoidable instances has tho proper execution or tho process of the United States tailed by reason of the absence of tho requisite appropriation. This course of official conduct on the part ot these officers, highly oredltable to their fidelity, wus advised by the Attorney Oolieral, who informed them, however, that they would necessarily have to rely lor their compensation upon the prospect ot future legislation I?y l oii;;P'Ms. lie therefore specially ret omnieuds that immediate aupTopriation b made by Oujv.r ss ior this purpose. The act uiaaiug tuu pnucipul ap : HERALD, MONDAY, DEI , propriation for the Department of Justice at previi ous HeaHioDK has uuiformly coutuined the following I cliuw:?"And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred ui the enforcement of the act approved February i!H. 187U, entitled 'Au act to ameud an act approved il.iy Jo, 18T0,' eutitled 'An act tj enforce tbo right oi citizens of the United State* to vote iu the several States of the United States, and tor other purposes, or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto.' " No appropriation wuh made for this purpose for ihe current year. As no general election of member* of C'ougrcss occurred, tne omission was a matter of little practical importance. Suchelcc- > tion will, however, take place during the ensuing year, sud the appropriation made for the pay of mamlials and deputies should be sufficient to embrace compensation for the services they may bo required to perform at such election. thk indian question. After referring to the recent Indian outbreaks the President says that while these occurrences, in which a comparatively small number of Indians were engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority of our ludiau population have fu>9 justified the expectations of those who believed that by humane and peaceful iidluenceu the Indian can be led to abandou the' habits of savage life and to develop a H4>.KU> IUI usciui ttuu u?iu/,cu uucupauuus. ?'uan they have already ac oiuplislied iu the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable success which lias attended the experiment of employing iM| freighters a class of Indians hitherto counted among tlie wildest and most Intractable, and the general and urgent dot, ire expressed by them for the education of their children, may bo taken as sufficient proof that they will be found capable of accomplishing much more if they continue to bo wisoly and fairly guided. The Indian policy sketched iu the report of the Secretary of the Interior?tlie object of which is to make liberal provision for tlie education of Indiau youth, to settle the Indians upon farm lots in severalty; to give thein title in fee to their farms, inalienable lor a certain number of years, und when tlieir watts are thus provided for to dispose by Hale of the lands on their reservations rot occupied and used by them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds tor the benefit of the Indians, which will gradually relieve the government of the expenses now provided for by annual appropriations?must commend itself as just and beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated to remove those obstructions which the existence of large reservations presents to the settlement mid development of the conntry. Ue therefore earnestly recommends the enactment of a law enabling the government to give Indiana a title in fee, iualienablo tor twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to them by allotment. He also repeals the recommendation made iu liis first annual Message that a law bo passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported their families for u number of years, and who are willing to detach themselves from their tribal relations, to the benefit of the Homestead act, und to grant them patents containing tho same provision of inalienability for a certain period. Tne experiment of sending a number o4 Indian children of both sexes to the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, iu Virginia, to receive an elementary Kuglisli education and practical instruction in farming and other useful industries, has led to results so promising that it was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania,- to the Interior Department for the establishment of an Indian school on a larger scale. This school has now 154 pupils, selected trom various tribes, and is in full operation. Arrangements are also made for tho education ?of a number of Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on the Pacific slope in a similar manner at Forest Grove, in Orugon. Those institutions will cummcnd themselves to the liberality of Congress and to the philanthropic munificence of the American people. TUG

THE GRANT BOOM. CONGRESSMAN AIKEN, OP SOUTH CAROLINA, DENIES THAT IT HAS ANT STRENGTH IN HIS STATE?A SOUTHERN VICE PRESIDENT UNDESIRABLE. Congressman Aiken, of South Carolina, arrived in this city on Saturday evening from a session of the grangers, held during the past week at Canandaigua, in this State, and is at present stopping at the Astor House. His son, a youth of eighteen, accompanies him. Yesterday morning they went to hear Dr. Talmago preach, and spont the afternoon in riding on the "L" roads and a visit to Central Park. Last night a Hebald reporter called upon Mr. Aiken to loarn his views as to tlie extent of the Southern "boom" for Grant in South Carolina. He said it was two weeks since he left South Carolina aud ho thought his Ideas upou direct questions were a little old, but ho was sure of the attitudo of his State toward Grant. "As for the Southern 'boom' for Grant for President and Wade Hampton for Vice President," the Congressman said, "I don't believe it has reached the alarming proportions credited to It. The idea of such a ticket is nonsensical in the highest degree to a Southern man. H there is any man in my State that would support General Grant I havo yet to know liim." "Does this feeling arise from his part in the suppression of the rebellion?" the reporter inquired. "Why, no. The feeling come* from his position In the latter years of his term as President. I don't believe that Grant is any worse a man than many others. It is his associates that the Southern Seople dislike and that did us so much harm during is term of office. With the ushering 01 Grant into office we would probably nave bayonet rule, and ltobeson, Babcock and all the other fellows' misrule." NO IMPROVEMENT TO BK ROPED FOR. "Cut would not Grant do better now that the Southern Statea havo showed for four years that they know how to rule themselves?" "What can we expect ot the man that said once, ! 'Let us have pence,' and then followed that harmo- ' nious express Ion by sondiug troops down into our State to rule us with their bayonets. As for the latter part of the ticket 1 will sav that I don't believe that Southerners wish to see a man lrom their section on the Presidential ticket, and it they did I would dread the results of the accomplishment of such a desire." "Why so? Do you anticipate any trouble to arise from that desire?" "Simply that it would ruin the entire country. My knowledge of the Northern people is that they would rather reduce the whole number of States under bayonet rule than allow a Southern mau to get a place on the ticket as Vice President. Such men as Garfield showed tho liberality of thought and tooling now existing toward Southerners in the North. lie is one of the leaders among the Northern people, and just such speeches as he made at Toledo tend to increase sectional feeling between the North and Mouth. lbslinun ?!. >? >... ?:,lt Mm Minlfn (if Wa.lu TTnnm.

DEMBER 1, 1879.?WITH S LITERATURE. Ulilhorn's Conflict Between Christianity and Paganism. SOME RECENT NOVELS. Poetry, Sports, Prints, Acting and Oratory? Book Notes. Christianity's conflict with heathenism. Dr. Gerhard Clilhoru, a German Protectant scholar and ecclesiastic, whoso titles in the latter world include the rather solocistic one of Abbot of Loccuin?a traditional and leyul one, however? as well aa member of the Supreme Consistory in Hanover, has written a work ou "The Conflict of Christianity with Heathenism," ot which Scribners publish a good translation, done by K. C. Smith and C. J. U. Hopes. lhe author intends his book to be a two-edged sword, cutting at old paganism with one edge and modern scepticism with tho other. It is a history of tho struggles of the early Church in the lioman Empire, viewed iu one respect irom the stand" point of those conclusions which ore distinctly Protestant. Aside from the disputed point as to the internal government of the early Church, on which so much is supposed to hang, it is catholic enough in tone and treatment to be accepted by Christiana at large as a clear, able and graphic picture of the war waged by Christianity for nearly four centuries on Uoiniin paganism?a war in which the victims were uniformly on tho side ot the victors. His opening chapter on the religious oonditlon of the heathen world, if not so elaborate in its details as that chapter iu the recent more voluminous work of the Jesuit, Father Thebaud, entitled "The . dentile World Confronting the Infant Church," summarizes the positiou very clearly. Perhaps the learned author strains for an epigram when he says "An abstract monotheism hovered more or less dixtinctly over polytheism." The sneers of certain writers in Homo at the existing religion are small material ont of which to make a monotheistic phantom. It was certainly very indistinct. To the con. flict in Home itself, however. Dr. Uhlhorn speaks most directly. There the final battle for the empire of the world had to be fought; but the growth of Christianity in the widely separated provinces was, alter all, the greatest factor in determining tho victory. The fortress had to capitulato wheu the in* vestment was complote. The perfect simplicity of the new faith, its emphatic teaching in the natne and by tho example of Christ, was eagerly grasped by the unsophisticated?that is, we may say it plainly, the ignorant?who now saw, as our author keenly says, that "the heathen deities were neither tho authors of the moral law nor Its exemplars." The varying degrees of gravity of the persecutions from Nero to Dioclotian are cleary indicated, the overdrawn pictures of meditevaj and modern commentators being through uui avuiueu. xue nttrauiiB persecution neaescriues, with the best modern writers, an a purely isolated outburst of politic rage, but be shows that so long as Christianity was illegal the strict execution of the law was never possible, even when pious pagans like Pliny the younger anxiously sought its exact meaning, or warlike emperors like Decius, laying all qualms aside, ordered its bloodiest fulfilment. It is the history of penal legislation in matters of faith without exception. Xhe author inclines fondly toward a belief in Constantino's vision of the conquering cross, though he prudentially enjoins caution aguinst accepting miracles outside the New Testament. Here we are brought to the author's standpoint again. We can only see plainly that he would aocept no modern miracles?JLourdcs miracles, for instance?on any such evidence as makes him look fondly at the cross in the heavens. But he inakos his strongest controversial point in setting up the attacks of Celsus on Christianity in the second century side by side with the destructive criticism or ltenan and Strauss in the nineteenth. Assuming that the conversion of the Human Empire completely answered Celsus, he leaves it to inference that all antagonists of Christianity to-day will be and are similarly answered. It is too much to leave to Inference. The example of the martyrs is out. worn as a weapon against modern scepticism, which readily admits their singleness and purity of purpose, and only asJta, What thon ? THE SECOND ADVENT. Br. Chauncey Giles, who Is probably the moat satisfactory American expositor of the beliefs that have been deduced from the writings of Emmanuel Swedenborg, has just published, through J. B. Lippincott & Co., a volume entitled "The Hecoud Coming of Our Lord." The book consists of twelve lectures, all of which the author has frequently delivered, and they are as different as can be imagined from the ignorant assumptions and declarations of the more material class of Adventists. The prophecies of Scripture and the visions of Swedenborg are spiritualized in th9 extreme, and, although many of the theories advanced will appear fanciful to thoso who have atudled only the biblical allusions to the general resurrection, their tone and directiou is such that the author finally seems to meet all Christians upon common ground, and to offer them much cause lor spiritual edification. ENOLIHH CONVICT LIFE. "Convict Life," by a ticket-of-leave man (Wyman & Son, London), Is written by a man who was transported for seven years for a crime committed under the influence of drink, its aim is to show how rotten the boasted English prison system has become. He says that he waa a gentleman, aud his book shows that ho was a man of education, lor it Is a fair ^oco of literary work. He does not make any attempt to excuso his crime and he asks no pity. That he should have beeu punished for breaking a law ho considers perfectly Ju*t, but be does find fault with a system which throws prisoners of his class with the professional convict. Men, he says, who "are so vile and so filthy that no reformatory system under God's sun would have the slightest chance of inspiring their cursed natures with ouo pure thought or ouo honest aspiration." lie finds that the "green" prisoner in punished for the aiighteat infringement of the law, while the "old birds," who play into the keeper*' hands, are allowed to go unpunished. Ho ho losos all respect for the authority over him, and learna to be ua tricky, and in the end a< corrupt, aa the moat hardened criminal. This writer gives as an example of the priaou rules a painful experience of his own. To kill time ha learned by hoart a number of poems from the fow books in the library. To facilitate the process of luemuriziug ho wroto some of tho lines with a bit of lead on a piece of brown paper. One warder who knew that he was dolug thia dreadful deed winked at it, but another, man who waa held iu bad repute by the olUclals, wishing to appear extremely active in the discharge of his duty, searched this prisoner's call, and there fouud tha offending paper, and carriod it in great gle* to the governor. The cocvlct'a timo was within a few day* of expiration; he had boen seven yeara in aervitude, and had never been given a black mark; but for thia helnona crime? wrttlug a few lines of poetry on a bit of paper-he was put on a three daya' bread-and-water diet and detained In prison aeven months over hla time. In giving examples of bad treatment and corrupt ofHciala this convict doea not spare names. William ltonpell, tho forger, formerly M. P. for Lamboth, was one of his associatea, and he aaya that ' that prisoner had a remarkably oaay time of it. The plea for prison reform in thia book la atrongly made. "COtJRIN HENRY." Anthony Trollope's latest story, "Oonaln Henry" (Harper A Brothers), would not hava made half lta length in tho hands of any other novelist. But Mr. Trollope la a great waterer, and It i* no task for him to make three volumes out of what is no more than enough for one. The plot of "Cousin Henry" is aa old aa the hills. Tho heroine, Isabel Uroderlck, lived With her unole, Indefer Jones, a rich bachelor, on a large eatate in the country. Uncle Indefer'a only mala rolative waa hla nephew, Henry Jonsa, UPPLEMENT. whom ho u ouly rich old uucleB can bate. f Tho old gentleman. however, loved Isabel, but ' ha thought it his duty to pocket his _ hate and leave thu property to Henry, a pro- \ ceediug unprecedeuteJ out of the pa^es j of a novel. Isabel, his favorite, lie intended to j leave nothing, but to provide tor her wants he ' planned a match between her and Cousin Henry, j Isabel was a young lady with a uiiud of her own, J and she turned a deaf ear to Cousin lienry's suit. | Uncle lndefer was taken ill, uud at the last inoineut 1 he changed his mind about the property and made another will leaving everything to Isabel, Tlien lie turned his face to the wall and died. Isabel, who was off on a visit, got back in time to hear her uncle say that he had made it all right. When it was time to read tlie will only the first copycould bo founa, and that left everything to Cousin Henry. It was darkly hinted that this young man had destroyed document No. 2, but he denied knowing anything about tho matter. He had not destroyed the second will, but ho knew where it was. He saw his uncle put it in a volume of sermons and he put the volumo on tho bookshelf in the library. When tho lawyers searched tho house they of course did uot thick of the books. AbjoUn, a Welsh lawyer, aud tlie?best, character 111 the book, suspected Cousin Hcury aud watched him closely. The wrongful heir was a great coward, aud spout moat of Ilia time iu the library with his eyes rivetod on the precious volume. At the proper momeut Abjoliu Collared Cousin lioury, aud Isabel's father waved the book before hiB eyes. He owned up aud they let him off easy. Isabel married the mau of her choice, who cliaugod his uirne to J ones, to share Uucle Iudefer's propjrty. "VIVIAN THE BEAUT 1." "Vivian the Beauty," a new story, by Mrs. Annio Edwards, just issued iu Appleton's Handy Volume series, is iu that lady's characteristic style. The principal Ilguro is a slapdash caricature of the "professional beauty" of the present day. Among tho other characters Mrs. Edwards' aduiirors will recognize old friends, notwithstanding the thiu veil which change of scenery, costuuios and names throws over them. The readers of "A Vagabond Heroine" will not fail to renew acquaintance with that character in Jeanne Dempster, the little English maiden brought up by her aunt in gloomy old Schloss Esmond, in tho Black forest, aud who grows up in love with the young Count whom sho remembors only as a boy ere he disgraced his family by leaving home to become an artist in foreign lauds. Herr Wolfgang, an unknown youth, who turus up in the Black Forest and is engaged us tutor to the lonely little muideu and wins her love "for himself alone," is seen by the reader to be the lost Count long before he makes himself known as such to his affianoed and the world. It la the story of Cinderell* over again, the matrimonial prize being curried off by the despised heroine from the clutches of Vivian Vivosh, the "beauty" who comes to the Schloss to marry the Couut, but whom tthe snubs unwittingly in the person of the despised tutor. Whatever be the faults of the story, aud they are many, duluess is not among them, aud the book will give full satisfaction to the admirers of its author's style. "THE SERPENT CHARMER." Boys In search of the adventurous will find all their hearts can desire in "The Serpent Charmer," translated from the Freuch of Louis Kousselet by Mary de Hautville. (Charles Scribncr's Sons.) The scone of the story Is laid duriug the time of the Indian mutiny, and the hero iB au old serpent charmer by the name of Mall. He is befriended by the son of a French planter living on the bauks of the Gauges, and when the father is killed he takes the boy under his protection. The young Frenchman is (Tressed like a Hindoo and learns to charm serpents so that the terrible cobra is a plaything In his hands. A boy with performing monkeys joins their party, and together they roam through Iudia. Th? mivniituraH of such a trio could uot fail to bo thrilling, ana M. Bousnelet has made the most of them. His stylo is graphic In the extreme and very natural withal. "SPOBT IN MAN? LANDS." Major Henry AsUbury Leveson, better known as "The Old Shekarry," was a soldier as well as a sportsman, and fought in muny wars and many countries. Hunting was his passion, aud when there woro no battles to light ho would shoulder his rifle and start off in pursuit of sport. The wountfc which caused his death was received in the Abyssinian war. Major Leveson has a graphic manner of describing his adventures, and ho tells the most astonishing stories without auy attempt at selfgloriflcation. In his lust book, "Sport In Many Lands" (Scribner & Welford), "The Old 8hekarry" takes ns Into African forest, over Scotch hills, through Indian jungles and across North American plains. Every page of Major Levesou's book abounds with the vitality of the man, and there is a rush and rattle about it that fill the reader with enthusiasm. "along THE WAY." This pretty volume of smooth and sweet poetry by Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge, published by 0. Scribner's Sons, has the m<?rit of an expressi ve title. It is a collection of fugitive versos, mostly gathered from magaziues to which the skilful editor or St. Xichotcu lias contributed thorn during the last few years. A great part are written on themes suggested by Incidents of childhood, but all are addressed to adult taste. We find no stunzaa among them likely to become familiar quotations, but mauy that give quiet pleasuro by refinement of imagery and purity of tone, and some that well deserve to be set to music. Mrs. Dodge possesses abundance of humor?possibly inherited?and ft dolicato vein of it runs through much of the poetry in this little book und will help to make it a cheerful Christmas gift in many a household, whllo here and there occurs a piece, like the introductory verses entitled "In the Canyon," which displays an uncommon power of perception and description of natural scenery in its relation to.human sentiment. "ACTINO AND OBATOltY." Mr. J. E. Frobishor, the toacher of elocution, has added to his published works ono bearing the above title (College of Oratory and Acting) which contains some usetul Introductory chaptors on elocution and gesture, passes on to a conglomerate of extracts from various works and uutlioritios arranged not too systematically. The author or eompiler indeed seems conscious of this, for in his prefaro ho considers "the present effort as rather eclectic in its charactor," which is rathor a lame way of accounting for what ho terms "its sometimes apparently coutradictory opiuious and illogical arrangement." He lias, in fact, emptied his scrap books into it with little heud to that artistic effect which he so often pleads should be strenuously attompted by others. As u result wo have a choppy, unsatisfactory book. Here is abundance of secondhand material, aud most of it good of its kind, but so tossed hither and thither as to try tho patience severely in the attempt to uaiu a concrete idea of what the author desires to Inculcate on auy particular point. Thla age ia in literature above all one of systematicatiou, collation and arrangement; H la an profoundly synthetic an analytic, and a book of thla kind ia unworthy of It. A patient editor might make aomething of it* inaterlala, which we do not wish to underrate, but wo caunot in frankueaa cotiuuond tha 111 digested divisions which here confront and confuse ua. In lapsos of graintnar and the typos It beara evidence of haate. To the former we noad not call apucial attention, bnt wo would instance a glaring error, perhaps oriiiiaally ono of tho types, but none the lean ao vitally mialeading aa to demand instant correction. Delaarte'a definition of art ia given aa "motion passed through thought and fl*od In form. Ita ocmu la the motion eubjectod to the deepeat scrutiny of thought and flxod in the noblest form." Thla nonsense may be corrected by reading "(. motion" for "motion." "THE PRINT COLLKCTOH." Aa a companion volume to Lubke'a "History of Painting" bodd, Mead & Co. have publlahod a handaome edition of Maberly'a "Print Collector," which haa been for aorao timo claaaed among "rare books." The value of Maberly'a volumo la well known to all intereated In art matters. Mr. R. Hoe, Jr., an amateur colloctor and one of tho directora of the Metropolitan Muaeuin of Art, haa edited thla first American edition and brought It down to dato. It Is with the utmost interest and delight that we follow tho expert Maberly through tlie ins and outs of Ilia print collector'* art. With what rare grace aud delightful a Auction he treats of old prints. How ho grows el njuent over tho engraver'* chisel aud the etcher's needle! Wo stop to read Mr. iioe's copious notes, full o! information until we come to the department of Contemporary Ktchiug aud liugraviug," wbcro lie lias tne [iayes to himself. Mr. Hoe begins his department by lamenting tho craving of the people for seuiatlou&lism in art. lie deplores the fact that artists 140 abroad aud seek novel subjects ill strange land*. Vut out of this very disruptiou of time honored systems have arisen new forms of art whoso intluuuco is now beginning to be felt, bucb men at ltousseau, Daubiguy and Corot, be says, did not flea it necessary "to draw inspiration from the ends of Mm earth. me urt or otcmug, be toils us, has do rival iu tho rapidity with which the "varied effects of nature can be seized and I transmitted to the copper, uud in the holiness I ad well ib delicacy of execution of which it is sua- I ceptible." Mr. Hoe thinks that the American mind / is especially adapted to the cxpre.?Bion of art in I this form. Under the head of "American Utcheru" only two naiucs are mentioned?Whistler and Henry Farrar. Tlyjse gentlemen are probably the best known, though some admirable work has been dona by -Mr. Peter Morun and Mr. Stephen J. Ferris with the etchers' needle. Although there are other books written on tho subject of print collecting Maber ly's has long b<n>u tho favorite, particularly witt amateurs, to whom its simple and genial styl< directly appeals. Tho publishers have sparod nc pains to make this an edition worthy of the subject, and it abounds in excellent fac-simile illustration! from master etchers and engravers. LITEKARY CHIT CHAT. Edmund Yates was one of Dickens' pets. Herbert Spencer ts one of the favorite authors or 1 tho ltussiaus. Tennyson has written two poems for St. Nicholas I which will be publishod in January. \ Mr. E. C. Stedman says that English girls dress \ better than they did five years ago. ) Mrs. Uayard Taylor's translations have made hei husband's works known to Germany"Isms of Forty Years Ago" is tho title of a papei which will appear in the January Jlarper't. A now novelfotte by Mrs. Burnett, called "Louisi* ana," is announced for publication in Scribner't. It is maliciously said thatViotor Hugo never reads but always praises the books and manuscripts that are dally sent to him. A new paper is announced in Paris with the title ot Gil IiUu. It is to be in the style of the Figaro, with a slightly republican tinge. The Figaro 1s just now conservative. "The Pledge and the Cross," written by Mrs. S. M. I. Henry, and published by the National Temperanca Society, is a simple but often affecting narrative of temperance efforts from the religious standpoint. "Constance Winter's Choice" (Loring) is an interesting story of a young girl who einbraccd the theat ricai proicssion. one piayeu iuu svse line or par it as Mary Anderson??. e., J uliet, Evadne, Meg Morrllcs. Speaking of Edmtind W. Gosse's new volume of poetry, tho Athenaum, which In general praises it highly, remarks:?"It is strange that sweetness of temper seems to be, of all the poetio moods, the most difficult to work in." "St. Maar: an Earl's Wooing,*' is the title of a sensational novel by John Carroll, of "The Caves," Baltimore couuty, Md. The scene is laid in Eng. land. There is a Are mud the hero rescues the heroine, and T. B. Peterson k Brothers are the pub? lisbers. Dr. Moritz Busch, whose "Bismarck and Bis Men" attracted nbout a year ago a great deal of attention, has published "New Diary Leaves," which, it appears, is mostly devoted to describing Dr. Busch himself, the "Iron Chancellor" being % mere "supe" in tho story. "Church Hymns, with Tunes," edited by Mr. Arthur Sullivan, is ono of tbe valuable books issued by the London Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (Pott, Young & Co., Now York). It is arranged on the simplest and most compact plan devisable, and gives, except in the children's hymns, a harmonized version of each tune. It has reached 111* one hundred and filth thousand of copies sold ia Great Britain and America. "Tho Stroet Singer," a poem by A Musician (Bel mick, Cincinnati), is a dramatic little story, illustrating the dangers of adopting street waifs into families. In this case the husband runs away with the adopted daughter. He is struck blind by lightning near Jerusalem, she forsakes him and both are received back by the patient wife. Tbe intended moral probably lies in the fact that the husband is a positivist, like Mr. Bob Ingersoll. "Talcs of Old Tliule" (Lippincott & Co.). collected and illustrated by J. Moyr Smith, is a bundle of old Scotch-Norae fairy stories?that is, they are of a Norse stamp and have been circulating in Scotland, in whose dialect tliuy aro told. Such books tell of the coming of Christmastlde, and their alarmingly grotesque or super-ornate illustrations Indicate the youthful fancies they are expected to fire. In "SUaker Sermons" Bishop H. L. Eads, of South Union, Ky., presents the body of Shaker theology. The doctrinos of self-denial, celibacy and chastity, which the Bishop seems to think the "goodly Ana Lee" discovered as bases of tho Christ-life, and therefore worthy of imitation, are discussed calmly and fully, while attention is paid to tho utterances of Mr. Bcechcr, Mr. Tulinage and Mr. Bob Ingersoll. Tho work is issued by the New York community. "Around tho Yule Log" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) proclaims its devotion to boys and to Christmas on its cover, gorgeous in gold, crimson, green, yellow, blue and orange. Mr. Klchard Markham has therein told the story of fivo boys and five girls on a Christmas visit to tho seaside in such a way as to bring into his narrative a number of the most striklug things in American history up to revolutionary times. Indians, sea rangers and patriots mingle bowilderingly iu it < plentiful illustrations, while the text, including some old ballads, is calculated to firo the young American heart. A really fino book for the young who have outgrown mere literary syllabub is "The Boys' Frolssort' " (Scribuer's Sons), being selections from the chivalrous chrouicles of Jean Froissart, "edited for boys, with an Introduction by the poet, Sidney Lanier. The selections from the chronicles are of tho stirring kind, and will please young readers immoiisciy, but wo would recommend to them tho preface as particularly worthy of carofal Biuuy. xi ih ciear iuu nuipio, ?uu K>vv" IM ??* Bpuce more iuaight tuto tUe rel?tlon? to each otbei of curtain chronicler* nn?l romancers of tbo Middla Ago* tUnil ninny u pretention* eaaay on tlio subject.
