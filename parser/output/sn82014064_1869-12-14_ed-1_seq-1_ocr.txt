Tbe action of the Senate last week, and of the Douse to-day, •hows, however, that a liberal policy will be pur sued toward persons who ask for a removal of disabilities, A fact or interest tn this connection Is that on the Ssturday before the message was delivered the President had in Ua sentence recom mending the passage ol an act of general amnesty as soon as all the States were restored, which he ■track ont on Monday morning, for the reason that he finally concluded it would not be Judicious adnoe. m FRiKimo rxmixGE.

Mr. TRUMBULL, from the Committee on the Judiciary, repartee, with amendment, the bill to relieve members of congress from im portunity and preseve the Independence of the departments of the govern ment. Tbe biH, as amended, prohibits recommendation to office by members of Con gress, ana appointments In accordance therewith, under a penalty of misdemeanor, punishable hy a fine not exceeding >I.OOO. T&e clause allowing each recommendations in response to written re quests from heads of departments Is stricken oat. jrxtspicnox op contra. On notion of Mr. DRAKE, the Senate took tip the bill further to define and regulate thejnn*. diction and powers oi courts of the Coned States The btli prohibits acy Court created by an act of Coni rets, or Judge thereof. from holding any act of Congress invalid for aoymppoeed repugnancy between neb act and the coosilmtlanx)! the united States, or for any supposed want of authority In the cousUcntloQ for iberaae; sudslvo requires that lb« appellate Jurisdiction of the Sapteuia Court 01 the Utdted states not be construed to authorize that Court, in any esse now pending or here alter brought before U, to affirm any Judgment, order, or decree of an inferior court which shall appear to hare been based upon such holdi&ra, nor shall any Justice of raid coon tn furtherance of the exercise of aald appellate Jurisdiction, make any oner based upon any such bolding by him or by said Supreme Court. Mr. DRAKE addressed the Senate at length in sopport oi the bill. In toe coarse of his remarks he aald that pnor to IS£T the practice of passing lodgment upon the constitutionality oi an act of Congress was unknown in tne Federal Courts. If this claim of the Federal Jodioary was estab lished, then a veto power more potent than that of the President—a power to veto, not a bin. tmt alav—was created. This power would virtually far exceed that oi Congress in point of sopremacy tn the goreroment. Its existence man be warranted by tho constitution, and 1 t not granted there, Its exercise can only be re garded as sn usurpation, which no sincerity of jaakln conviction to its favor coold uphold, and which coold deserve no rightful force became of long continued alienee on the part of Congress. if - the exercise of this power bad been tolerated because of the misinterpretation of ue Constunilon or a want of consideration of the subject, and consequently bad been exercised for yean, tt was no leas the duty of Congress to apply the remedy then tt would I be tf the assertion of the power h*d Just been I broached for the first time. Slxry-*lx years ago I the Supreme Court of the United States, under t&e 1 lead of Chief Justice Marshal', without having heard any arguments on the question, asserted Its j riahttoholdanactof Cocgrees ancon*tirntioiial; and from that day to this U had passed into a proiesstonal dogma that subh a rlgat existed, | which dogma had been accepted without- tovwtl- 1 caUon or question. The legal fraternity bad not questioned it, nor had it been qaeadocel in t&e , balls of Congress, until the speaker de nied us truth 'in February. The error was one which urgently needed attention, because of laie years toe Supreme Coon hid teen bwt by parties to decare son and void important acts of Congress—amoog oth ers, those in which Congress bad exer cised t&e power of declaring a tax on cotton grown tn country, of taxing state tasks, of disposing of ndltar* lands, and of declaring military governments over sub jected rebels. ifthw claim of the Judiciary wjs acceedcd to, where would u end? Each snoceeefnl effort to overthrow Conzres* atonal action would lead to oihers until the judi ciary weold loom op as tae great cwotral power of the government. It was the purpose 0: the bill to reach tee root of this threatened evil—to place CcrgrpM wdere the Constitution placed it—above and not below me Jjdiciary, Jt was not the object to take from me court any cDccutnUonsi right, for that was beyond the power of Cotgress, but to prevent U from passing toe limits of in rightful anthocur under the constitution. it was cot intended to assail t&e Court, but to shield the representatives of the peop’e in their legislation from unauthorised Judicial interfer ence. The power of Congress to pass this bill, was beyond dispute, it ought be urged that to give congress a right to fudge of the constuußouainy of tta acts made it In effect omnipotent; but this objection had uo face, inasmuch as tt was baaed naou the hypo thesis tnst a majoroy of Osamas vsow he VOL. 23. equally of their oaths of office, their fealty ta the

BROOKS, of New York, said be had hoped the gentleman from Massachusetts would have redeemed the promise he made tn the last Con* pirn to bring in a genera.’ bill removing these disabilities. He had, ne hoped, to hear no more of this peddling the amnesty ox toe government, bat that a general amnesty would be passed wormy of tbe chanty and generosity of this great govern ment, and that the statute hook would bsno locicr encumbered with the pardons is detail. Mr. BUTLER was happy to inform the gentle man from New York that tbe consideration of a bill to provide for the removal of disabilities from those who bad offended tne country by their re bellion was coir before the Committee on Recon struction, and he doubled so; that as boos as other usu more pressing duties could be attended to in that committee, such a bill will be reported. At least he knew is would be considered by the committee. This bill was pat forward pending the necessary delay tn consideration of such gen eral bl.l, end to meet the exigencies of the case. Mr. COX said he bad objected, the other day, to this bin, when the gentleman from Masiachn setts introduced It, and substantially, in nu own mind, aitrongb be did not express it, for tbe same reason given by his coOasgoe (Brooks), it looked like small business to be peddling out the amnesty of tbe government in tuts sort of way. lie believed It was so recognised by all parties. 1; tad been recognised always tn all tree govern ments, sad tn ali ages, msl when a civil war was over amnesty should be given; and now, after five years since tbe conclusion of the late civil war, this government had atUl these per sonal amnesties, lie gsve notice to the gentleman tram MasracbuKtu that, hereafter, whenever a bill came on granting amnesties to a «m»i[ anm. ter of iaolrldoaU, be should Interpose hts objec tions. Be did not propose to do it on this occa sion, for tbe reason thit the men named in the bill had applied to the necessary Federal offices, and it was necessary that they should hare their par don, in order teat they might fill their inactions. Mr. BUTLER said be could not agree with the gentleman tram New Yore la say log this was a small business. There was more joy in Heaven over one Earner that repented than over the nicety and nine Jut persona who need no repent ance. Mr. COX remarked that he understood from that (bat the sinners pardoned by bill belonged to the Republican party. If they were Democratic sift ers they would not be isctoded tn this amnesty. Bnt tte Democrats forgive them freely if gentle men on tbe other side woo'd forgive them. Gen erally, these amnesties ware given ai the coniid- . eratioa for treachery, and for the purpose of ad ding recrntta.to the Radical party, and not out of that abonoant generosity of wluca the gentleman from Massachusetts was himself so brilliant an example. [Laughter.] Mr. MAYNARD asked the gentleman from New York If that was not a proper motive far pardon, to bring recruits from tne rebel ranks into the ranks oc loyalty 7 Mr. 001 referred to the fact that the other day Louis Napoleon, six smu after an attrinnud in auzrecilon, while men were after hts life, gave an amnesty to the whole realm, and made nimself ■ JTng by the act. Mr. BUTLER desired to ray, once for all, that be did not think a great republic needed to take a leeron from an Emperor how to make Itself strong. • The bin passed. Tbe Douse then went into committee of the Whole, Mr. DAWKd tntbe chair, and resumed tbe consideration of tbe Census bul. Amendments offered by Mean.

The great difficulty til through the ertns Just paired has been on account of ue Independents. Of We fifteen elected on this basis, perhspa but four ccold be truly relied upon aa such, aad these were Republicans exception. All the so called Independent Democrats have been in a* fall unison and harmony with the rest of their party aa the most bitter partisan could wtan. THW OUSXS. My tut despatch informed yon that Anthony, of Cook, had been put forward on tho pan of some of the independents, sad that the nomination wu folly endorsed by the Democrat*. The first ones to kick against this movement were members of the Cook County delegation, who bad pledged them selves to sappon Hitchcock. Upon learning of the cool manner in whkh some of the rankest Demo crats haiTproceeded to arrange the balance of the so called Independent ticket, the opposition from this quarter became very intense, and then it was discovered that some of the Southern Democrats were rampant and refused positively to sappon Hitchcock,whatever might be the consequences. At an early hour this morning, and while the Re publicans were in caucus at the Capitol, matters again looked more equally, if pout hie, than ever. It required all the influences that the Dsoocratie leaders could bring to bear to prevent an open outbreak. Perhaps this would hsve never been accomplished bat for the fact that four Demo cratic members had not yet arrived, and that the two Tlsines were said to be In caucus with the Re publicans. Then it was rumored that Anthony was weakening, and that Underwood was iu ton harmony with his party. All these things had the effect of keeping the rebellious Democrats la the traces. The manner in which things fluctuated throrghout the morning hours is be yond all precedent. This moment, and one man seemed to hold in bis hand the destinies or the convention. Then be would be dogged aid followed and interviewed until be committed himself. Then there would be au outbreak some where else, and some other Independent would wsnt a Uttie cooking. While there was this sen sation m Democratic circles, the Bepublicans were sot leas active. The latter called a caucus at 9 o’clock in the morning, which was held in the Library Boom of tho Capitol. This was attended by all the Bepublicans, and by Haines, of Cook, Haines, of Lake, and Medlll, of the Chicago dele gation. MB. MZPXU. AFP TSX TUSZDDfCT. The latter gentlemin went there for the pur pose of mbaEy declining the nomination for the Presidency, which had been tendered him a few days prevlou*. He told the caucus that, besides his physical reasons for declining, he was aouted, beyond the possibility ot a doubt, that he could not be elected. He could count opou but the vote* of two Independents, whereas twice that nsaber woald be required to elect him. There were a great many tuirlng speeches made, the burdens ot which were that the Republicans could net ac cept of Mr. MedUl's declination, and that be most take the nomination. There were a large of Influential members oi the party from all pans of the state preteat la the caucus, who also to. slated that Mr. MediU should abide by tne wishes of the ranwiki That gentleman then stated »*—* he had expressed hla opinion and could aj no more. The caucus then proceeded to a ballot, when It was found that Ur. Medlll had agaii the Republican Domination for the Presidency, and this without a dissenting vote. sxrcßttcax woMucanowa The following slate was also arranged for the balance of the officers: Secretary, £.

In the meantime the Democrats had been tn constant telegraphic communication with their absent member*, and bad learned the exact time of their arrival, and to offered no opposition to the auem* bllsg of the delegates. to or m* anrmnoit. A half hoar after the timw appointed, dwray which the delegates bad got together in the ante, room, the doon of the Ball of Representative* were thrown opes. The rnah of outsiders waa immense. They filled the gallery, crowded the aitlea,;and occupied every available mauding point. It took hot a few moments for the dele* gates to select their seats, when a system of fill* busteriog acd pettifogging waa commenced, which bay. probably, never had its equel in this city in so great a body. Josh Allen sprang to hia feet and nominated Colonel Dement, of Lee, for President, and called for the ayes and Does. There was .'about an equal response. Be* lore a division could be called, Allen eaid the affirmative had it, and appointed a com* mmee to conduct Dement to the chain Hr. Church then took the floor and nominated Carey, of Jo Daviess, for temporary President. Upon a vote being taken, it was decided In the tlve, and Hr. Cany was also escorted to the chair. During the rest of the day these gentlemen oo* copied the position together. For two home there waa no business done whatever. Hr. Church wished the Secretary of Stare to can the roll of members, and proceed at osce to the elec tion of officer*. This movement brought about a doxen menberi to the floor. Skinner, of Adams, got the eyes of the Chairman, and proceeded to make an argu ment of two boors' length against any saeh pre- ceeding. The Democrats knew that Cody, of Du page, bad cot yet sent tn bis certificate, and that, therefore, he was not on the roll, which was about to be called; and they were also Informed of the fact that two more of their number were within tn hour’s ride of the city, and Vere nearing there with an the speed that steam could give, asd so Skinner talked against tune, notwithstanding frequent interruptions, and only finished when n was announced that the. ab sentee* had arrived, with the exception of Heeoe, who is delayed at home by sickness la his family. After this utae incident, things went okin aeon* relatively hanaonioos manner. <'X raounxx xucnoiv tcwdat.

The Democrats have some good talkers, and win talk into all eternity before they win allow the question to come np, tmtee* It win be clear that one vote their views win be adopted.

While there has been soxneihmgtbatsrstappcaredu though copies*- aot rewntis might occur, my obligations and grati tude are eminently increased by what I firmly be lieve to be a hanooaiona coaclaalon of this httle episode, as 1 shall please to call It lam frond of it on account or the kindness and good eeltrg that 1 believe exists between the gentle man who was proposed for the same position and myself, and when 1 cast my vote for him then was something more intended than a mere exchange of courtesies. I respect the gentleman—l respect these gentlemen woo exchanged their rotes in his favor, for to doing. 1 really recognize and esteem the motives of those gentlemen. The compliment that I have receivea at jour baud* ta greatly enhanced by the circumstances that have been mentioned here already to, 1 may say, too complimentary terms by me. Nevertheless, with out adopting thee© compliments and sentiments, I most say that l regard this compliment as high as it-Is possible for me to regard any. from the reason that lam fully sensible that of your honor able body there are members who are my seniors and my superiors. But I hare another reason to feel grateful to you. There are gentlemen here with whom I have been associated la the conven tions of isn and 1562, and there are. gentlemen, my friends and acquaintances or forty years* standing. These circumstance* renew to my mind scenes of my Ufe that are dear to me. It carries me back.** U has been sold, to the period when I explored the then wilderness of the Territory of Illinois, and you will allow me, with yourselves, to express my gratitude, admiration, and wonder at the great change which we experi ence in comparing these two periods; when our State contained, probably, not over twenty thou sand white people, and the prestnt, when we esti mate ita population by millions. We all recognize the fact that we occupy our present positions at the call of thlsgreat people, in the exercise of the mott conservative and liberal spirit, and also the obligation that these clrcamitauces impose upon ns, of framing a constitution and a fundamental law under the provisions of which the aChtrs of our State shall be administered for the prosperity and happiness of the millions of our Slate, as well as far their welfare in the future.
