There'll jps no opportunity for a Wrangel with any odious contemporary. Justice Stephen J.

The latter was appointed in 1ST9. ^.At the recent election in Salt Lake ''City, where women have the same rights of suffrage as men, all the women candidates for office were defeated, and efentedbadly. They were slaughtered ky tht~^*^j| of their own sex, who, it seems, were unwilling to lift any of their number to official preeminence. John Wanamaker, of Philadelphia, who i^tine of the heaviest and most un ^•ffiitting advertisers ever known, says his method is simple: "My plan for 20 years has been to buy so much space in a newspaper and fill it up as I wanted." There are many ways to advertise, but Mr. Wanamaker sticks to one, and is satisfied with It. The old gold-brick game has just been, played in Cleveland, only with varia tions adapted to the times. A saloon keeper of that enterprising city was in duced to part with $12,000 of his good money for 67 pounds of brass filings and sand, palmed off on the poor fellow iis a bag of Klondike clean-up. A fel low saloon keeper who played the part of decoy duck is in jail, "but the old miners skipped. According to the government report, the number of money order offices iu the country is 20,000, as against 9.382 re ported in 1S90, and this does not include the J,051 limited offices where orders arc limited to sums not over five dollars. The amount of orders issued last year was $175,000,000. In this branch of Uncle Sam's business there wasa profit last fiscal year of $790,230, which is do ing very well. Steps will be taken to greatly increase the number of offices and the business. It appears that there is not a single st ate nor territory in the union in which there is not a trial for murder pending. While it is a mooted point whether legal punishment lias any deterrent ef fect upon crime, there is ample evi dence of too much professional cour tesy at the expense of justice. There is a feeling among the people, how ever, that in the near future crime must be punished more, and more effective measures for the preservation of so ciety's peace are to be made. The Thanksgivingproclamtion of the governor of Alaska is a unique paper. Here it is: "On account of the wonder ful discoveries of gold upon the Klon dike we have been brought prominently before the public, and many who have decried Alaska as good for nothing now are admitting that it has wonderful possibilities. For this turn in the tide of opinion let us give thanks. While the cattle uponlthe hills are the Almighty's, tljc. gold, copper and coal in the moun tains and the fish in the sea are His also." No one who has kept track of the de velopments in the Klondike region will be surprised af the news that a famine as imminent at Dawson City. All through the fall men continued to flock into thatdistrict, relying upon the transportation companies to bring in supplies of provisions for the winter. They were warned by experienced Alas kans against the danger that threat ened them, but very few heeded the warning. The result is that starvation threatens every man'in the Klondike re gion who failed to bring with him six months' supplies. Every little while reports come from the great oceanic spaces of the orient of elemental disturbance, sv.ch as earthquakes, tidal waves and hurri canes, that result in loss of life that, make disasters on this continent seem tame in comparison. The latest horror is a typhoon that swept the Philippine islands and left 0,000 dead1. Between the Spanish besom and the typhoon's sweep the Philippines are in a lamenta ble condition. The awful strength of one of these hurricanes in southern seas is quite unimaginable by those who have not had experience of these disturbances. The rapidity with which a wild ani mal tnay be exterminated can be judged from the fact that the Smithsonian in stitution has recently tried in vain to obtain a living specimen of the wild, or tjassenger, pigeon which was formerly found in this country in countless mil lions. After tho offer of a liberal reward and much correspondence it lias been concluded that the American wild pi geon is extinct. The seals arc going just as fast. This year's catch In the North Pacific is little more than half that of last season. Three or four years more will wipe out the seals unless their slaughter is stopped or regulated. With both the emperor of China and the king of Italy considering the ad visability of abdicating their thrones it is evident that what Artemus Ward called "the king business" is not an al together satisfactory iudustry at the present time. Royalty has worries and tribulations that ordinary humanity exempt from. The theory that the king can do no wrong is only a theory.

SAQASTA ON THE MESSAGE Intimate* That President Doesn't Mean All He Says. Madrid, Dec. 9.—The. premier, Senor Sagasta, in an interview regarding President McKinlcy's message to con gress, is quoted as saying lie thinks tlie message satisfactory, "because the threat to Intervene In Cuba was made merely to give satisfaction to a portion of American opinion, without the in tention of executing it." Continuing, the premier said that the government would not make a declara tion on the subject. He believed the president's words would have influence with the insurgents, and added+hat the cortes would not be convened until the government had ascertained the effect of the message upon the United States congress. El Liberal, commenting on the presi dent's message, saya: "It is more fa vorable to Spain than President Cleve land's, because it recognizes Spain's in tention to enthusiastically labor to re establish peace in Cuba." The minis terial El Globo praised President Mc Kinley's message, the sooialist repub lican El Pais asserts that the message is "shameful" as it "implied the moral bankruptcy of the monarchy." The republican Progresso takes the ground that the message is a "great humilia tion." La Corrcspondencia de Espana, the official organ, say3 that after reflection Spanish opinion on President McKin ley's message to congress Is less opti mistic than at first. Tt proceeds to im pugn tho sincerity of .the president's protestation of friendship for Spain and of respect for international obliga tion, but itadmits t'hat the message was "addressed to congress principally and in language which, though not intend ed to please Spain, will annoy jingoes and filibusters."
