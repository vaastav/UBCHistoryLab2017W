UMSto M Charge Against Peacock Dismissed Because Of Error IlliL OF 01HEIS AWtSIED IS POSTPONEB HEADS OF FIRM8 BROUGHT INTO COURT ON WARRANTS IS SUED AGAINST COR PORATION8 An error In tho manncr of making out and serving tho warrant against V.

Attorneys Drcckons and Ashford rep resented tho defenso In tho cases against Peacock, Cho Hut Hln and Sing I.oy. - When Cho Hut Hln's case was call ed Ashfo'rd Immediately moved that the defendant bo discharged from cus tody on tho ground thcro was no war rantHacalnst. him. Tho warrant on v.hlchho wss arrested was sworn out against the wing Chung Lun Co., and the attorneys for tho dofensa claimed that tho arrest of one of the supposed raombors of, 'tho .firm was, Illegal. "Thora Is no charga'agalnst this man," said Asbfbrd, and ho Is not hero by due ptricess of law. Wo demand that he berclcSBCd. Ahdnulb opposed tho motion on the ground ;tbat Che nut Hln was not yet charged before tho court. Judgo Whit ney continued lho case until tomor row. In tho caso against W. C. Peacock tho same arguments wcro advanced, but with better success for the de fense. Brcckons argued that Peacock was Illegally arrested slnco tho war rant was directed against tho corpora tion of which Peacock was supposed to bo lho president. "Thcro 1b a way In which tho corporation may be brought Into court on such a chargo," he said, "but a singlo member of lho firm cannot bo tried for an offciiso committed by the firm." Andrade did not strongly oppose tho' motion for dismissal In this csbc, hav ing apparently come to the conclusion that nothing could bo gained by trying the case In lis present form. It In probable that new warrants, not opn to tho same objections, will be Issued. Harry Jucn and Joe Clark did not have tho samo excuse, of being only co-partners In a firm, and will prob ably have to stand trial. Both asked for a continuance In order to obtain counsel, and their cases were contin ued. Clark's caso was set for Decern ler 18 aud Juen'a for tho 12th. Sing I.oy, charged with tho samo of fense, was also represented by Brcck ons and Ashford, who entered a pica of not guilty and demanded Immediate trial.

YODNI DECLINED OFFEI TO BUY BIS CONCEtN WILL DO ONLY A REPAIR AND AQENCY BUSINESS IN HORSE LESS VEHICLES BUT NOT LIVERY TRADE A movement Is on foot to start a new garage. The only business of this kind now In operation Is that belonging to Alexander Young, but It Is thought that tho large number of automobiles In tho city will Justify the cstAbllshlng of a rival concern. It has not been quite settled as yet, whothcr tho proposition will bo carried through, but the matter Is being looked up carefully, and It Is expected that In tho near future, a definite decision will bo made. One of those who havo tho matter in hand, stated this morning that no dcflnllo arrangements had been made nss yet, but admitted that the proposi tion had been taken up. "Wo will. It wo decide to enter Into the business at all, merely take tip the repair and agency business," he said. "We will -noVdoWiy livery work, as wo do Hot think It pays. If you do livery busi ness with cheap machines, you aro continually having trouble-with thciu, and If you use expensive cars, you tie up too much capital. "We proposed at first to buy out the Alexander Young garage, but Young would not sell. Ho would not even Rive us a figure. Ho said that ho be lieved that he must run the garago In connection uith tlic Youn; Hotel. "We will, If we go Into the ,mi;.nc;js. begin with a rented building for our garago. We have at present In view tho Stock Yards building and another. "The entire proposition Is still un settled, and tho negotiations regarding It are still pending. However, there nre now over n hundred machines In this city, and we bellovo that there would bo sufficient business for a new concern, If It wero started." The Bulletin's Informant would not give out the nltnes otv4tbobc who arc associated with him In the proposition. He stated that he did not feel Justified In doing bo at the present time. e a
