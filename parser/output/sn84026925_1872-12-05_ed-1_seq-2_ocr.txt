The Chief Engineer of the Army, in his report to the Secretary of War, asks for appropriations in the following suras for the repairs of and strengthening sea coast defences in the south : Fort Moultrie, 830,000; Fort Sumter, 850,000; Fort Johnson, 810,000; Castle Pinckney, 88,500. No indictments were found at the last term of the St. John's County, Fla., Circuit Court.

They must prepare to resign one or the other." One of the most touching instances of gratitude is alleged to have occured at Lock Haven the other day. A little boy, the child of a wealthy mother, tumbled into the river. He was rescued by a workingman and restored to his parent. The woman gave the man a three cent postage stamp, and said she would be glad to have him come up to her house and sit out in the entry and hear her play the piano. He went away with tears in his'eyes. He said he wasu't used to such overwhelming kindness. The government gets compensated in an unexpected way for the losses it suffered in the injury done by fire to the new Boston Postoffice and sub-treasury building. The sale of stamps in Eoston for four days of last week was in excess of the sale of any whole month previous, and it is estimated that the destruction of postage and revenue stamps in the burned district?which, of course, was all gain to the government?will exceed all the government losses by the fire. In relation to the tax levy, the Columbia correspondent of the Charleston News says: "I learn from good authority that the plan now favored by the members of the new administration contemplates the authorization by the Legislature of a tax of thirteen mills. This will include six mills to pay the expeuses of the current fiscal year, two mills for the support of the public schools, and five mills to pay "deficiencies." No one talks of making any provision for the payment of the interest on the State bonds until all doubts have been cleared away as to their proper amount and I status." While some colored men were digging j . a post hole in the marble yard of William A. , Nicholson, last week, they discovered a deposit of bogus Mexican dollars, which had evidently lain there for many years, for the roots of an oak tree, standing many feet from the spot, where interwoven among the spurious coin. They pretended to represent Mexican dollars, dated 1808, but were badly executed, lioth in metal aud the impress of the die.

Cash.?It must be distinctly understood that our terms for subscription, advertising and jobwork, are cash, in advance DEATH OF HORACE GREELEY. Never before in the history of this nation has it occurred that the man acting so prominent a part as candidate for the Chief Magistracy, has died in the interval between the casting of the popular vote and the rendition of the vote of electors on the Presidential tickets. But so it is in the death of Horace Greeley, the announcement of which, coming so unexpectedly, takes the country by surprise. Mr. Greeley died on Friday evening last, at fifty minutes past six o'clock. His constitution broke down under a prolonged physical prostration, superinduced by an exaggerated sense of the meaning and consequences of his defeat for the Presidency, and most intense sorrow for the death of his wife, for whom he had a tender and almost romantic affection. It will be remembered that he was called to her bed-side before the close of the canvass, and he was unremitting in his attention to her wants until the moment of her death, during which time, embracing a period of several weeks, he scarcely slept or ate. So prostrated was his system, that on the 12th ultimo he abandoned the effort to discharge the duties of editor of the Tribune, which he resumed on the day after the election, and he steadily grew worse, the symptoms of his disease developing into inflammation of the brain, under which he rapidly sank. The Tribune thus describes Mr. Greeley's closing hours: At times he was delirious, at other times as clear-headed as ever. He lost strength with startling rapidity, and in a few days the possibility of his speedy death forced itself into unwilling recognition. It was not, however, until Thursday last that his associates and family brought themselves to admit it, and even then they still clung to his faith in the vigor of his constitution. On Wednesday night he failed very rapidly. Thursday afternoon and evening he seemed somewhat easier. During the night he slept well, muttering occasionally, and frequently raising his right hand. Toward morning he was more quiet, and between 8 and 9 o'clock fell into an unconscious condition, which continued with some intervals through the day. He made occasional exclamations, but many of them, in consequence of his extreme weakness and apparent inability to finish what he began, were unintelligible. About noon, however, he said quite distinctly and with some force : "I know that ray Redeemer liveth." During the day he recognized various people, his daughter many times, the members of his household at Chappaqua, Mr. John R. Stuart and Mr. Reid. On the whole, he suffered little, and seemed to have no more than the ordinary restlessness which accompanies the last stage of disease. During the day his extremities were cold, and there was no pulse at the wrist, and the action of the heart was very intermittent and constantly diminishing. He had not asked for water or been willing to drink it up to Friday, when he asked for it frequently. Up to within a half hour of the end he manifested by various ways his consciousness of what was going on around him, and even answered in monosylables any intelligently questions addressed to him. About half past three he said very distinctly, "It is done!" Beyond the briefest answer, this was his last utterance. The remains of Mr. Greeley were conveyed to New York from Pleasantville, the town in which he died, on Saturday evening, and placed in the residence of Samuel Sinclair, publisher of the Tribune. The funeral took place yesterday from Rev. Dr. Chapin's church. No special invitations were seut out, but the various organizations in the city formally attended, and the Union League made an effort to secure the attendance of President Grant at the obsequies of his late distinguished rival in the political field. 

ALABAMA AFFAIRS. The State of Alabama presents the singular spectacle of having two Legislatures in session at the same time?both at the capital; one having assembled in the capitol building, and the other in the court house. The former has a small Democratic majority, and the latter a Republican majority, and both bodies claim to have been constitutionally elected. Governor Lindsay, whose term had not expired at the time of the assembling of these legislative bodies, refused to recognize the one which assembled in the court house; but his successor, Lewis, who was installed last week, sent a commuuicationto this body, designated as the bolters, recoguizing them as the properly constituted Legislature, and promising cooperation with them in legislation. It thus turns out that both bodies have received gubernatorial recognition. Much excitement exists, but the Legislature at the capitol, having in both branches been called to order by the officers and means provided by the Constitution of the State, and being composed of men holding regular certificates of election, and having been officially recognized by Governor Lindsey, who was Governor of Alabama when the Legislature assembled, and who sent his message to and approved bills passed by them, are determined to hold their organization, relying on the regularity and legality of their course and the sense of justice of the Federal Government. The excitement was somewhat increased on Saturday, caused by a detachment of the Seventh United States Cavalry marching in front of the capitol grounds. When it was ascertained, however, that the troops were merely intended as a posse comitatus, and that it was not the intention to eject the Legislature from the capitol, the excitement subsided. The as-1 sembly in the capitol-building, designated as | the Conservatives, passed a bill on Saturday | and sent it to Governor Lewis, but he refused j to receive it; whereupon a joint resolution ' was passed raising a committee to communi-1 cate the facts of the situation "by telegraph j to the Government at Washington, and appointing delegates to present a written statement of the case to the President. The Conservative Legislature expresses the greatest confidence that the President will sustain them when the facts are laid before him. In answer to the committee of the capital*' (Conservative) Governor Lewis replied that ; there were two bodies claiming his recogni- j tion, and that the members of the other body,' (bolters,) had received a majority of the votes cast, and that he could not recognize the Capitol Legislature, because if the persons whom he said did not receive a majority were included, that body would be without a quorum. The court-house body was in secret session most of the time on Saturday, and their proceedings have not been made public. 

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS. Both Houses organized ou Monday, with J Vice-President Colfax and Speaker Blaine in the chairs. Mr. Sumner introduced a bill proposing to strike from the United States flags and the Army Register all mention of battles with fellow-citizens. He also attempted to call up his old pet, the civil rights bill, but was prevented by the rules. The House refused to accept the resignation of Banks from the chairmanship of the Foreign Committee. A resolution was introduced regarding the Credit Mobilief, proposing to appoint a committee of investigation. Pending this resolution Speaker Blaine called S. S. Cox to the chair, and the resolution as now before the House is, that the temporary Chairman, S. S. Cox, Democrat, announce thecommittee. [Credit Mobilier is a French term, * t t . ?.3 a1_ simply meaning movaoie creau, ana in mis sense is used to dignify alleged swindles in the construction of the Pacific Railroad, in which several New England capitalists are implicated.] At forty minutes past one o'clock the President's message was received and read. The subjects he treats are the Geneva arbitration ; the northern fisheries and our relations with the British North American provinces; our relations with China and Japan; the importance of legislation to cheapen the transportation of western products to the Atlantic coast; the weakness of the navy; the abolition of the franking system, which he recommends. He refers to the operations of the ku-klux, and expresses his conviction that the time is not far distaut when the obvious advantages of good order and peace will induce an abandonment of all such combinations, and when it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecutions or to inflict punishment in order to protect citizens from the lawless doings of such combinations. He also recommends that a census be taken in 1875. After the reading of the message, both Houses adjourned in respect to the memory of Mr. Greeley.

EDITORI ALKKLINGS. The North Carolina Senatorship. Balloting for a Senator to succeed Hon. John Pool has occupied most of the time of the Legislature of North Carolina since its organization. The Republicans placed Mr. Pool in nomination, and the Democrats, up to Saturday, have been divided in their support of ex-Governor Vance and Judge Merriraon. Several ballotings have taken place, but neither candidate received the number of votes necessary to a choice. At the latest advices the friends of Vance and Merrimon had withdrawn them, and it was probable that Gen. A. M. Scales would be elected. The Tote for Mr. Greeley. Since the death of Mr. Greeley, the question has already arisen, "For whom shall the Democratic or Liberal Electors cast their votes for President?" The importance at-, tached to the vote to be cast seeins to. be the bearing it may have on a nomination four years hence. The name of Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, has been suggested. The New York Tribune, in a leading editorial, counsels the electoral colleges of the States which cast their votes for its late editor to give their suffrages to Grant. The World claims that the Greeley electoral votes should be cast blank. The National Democratic Committee have issued Of circular in which they say they do not regard it as within the scope of the authority delegated to them to advise the electors as to the course which they shall pursue in view of the death of Mr. Greeley, and deem it inadvisable to make any recommendation. The Forty-Third Congress. The present Congress, the forty-second, which assembled on Monday last, and the term of which will expire on the 4th of March, has in the House 243 members. Of these the Republicans have 139 members and the Democrats 104 members. In the forty-third Congress, the House will have 292 members, or 49 more than at present. Of this number the Republicans will have 208 members and the Democrats 84, which restores the Republicans two-thirds majority. The present Senate is composed of 57 Republicans and 17 Democrats. The Senate of the forty-third Congress will have 55 Republicans and 19 Democrats, a gain of two Democrats. Five of the Republicans are Liberals, who may be expected to vote with the Democrats, making 50 Grant supporters and 24 opposition. This still leaves a two-thirds majority for the Republican party in the Senate. President Grant and the Ku-KIux. An Alabama ku-klux, who was sentenced to the Albany penitentiary for ten years, has been pardoned recently by President Grant in pursuance of a policy which it is reported the administration intends to carry out in other cases, and is based on a petition for clemency signed by leading citizens of 1 botl) political parties residing m tne locality and familiar with the charges on which conviction and imprisonment were secured. It is also further stated that in a recent conversation, the President declared he intended to inaugurate no particular line of policy toward the South, as had been represented, unless it was embodied in the careful consideration of application for the pardon of the ku-klux 1 prisoners. He had already pardoned one, (mentioned above,) and should probably pardon more, though he intended no general jail delivery. He thought that where the neighbors of these ku-klux prisoners applied for pardon, and represented the average senti- 1 ment of the community, all applications should be promptly acted upon; but to favor & general release of that element, would, in his opinion, be a virtual admission that they bad been improperly convicted, or that the law under which they were imprisoned was unnecessary. The Arkansas Governorship. Affairs in Arkansas are somewhat threatening. It is claimed that Brooks, the candidate of the Liberal Republican party, received at the last election a majority of from 1000 to 1500 votes, while the Radical Republicans claim their candidate, Baxter, to have been elected by a majority of 700. It is alleged that the Radicals practiced fraud in various ways in order to overcome the majority cast for Brooks, and the Brooks party openly and deffantly declare that he shall be inaugurated, if need be, "at the point of the bayonet." A large meeting of the Liberals,

Brooks himself was present, and in a passionate speech declared that, so far as the rights of the people were concerned, he was ready to install the officers elected by them. In his speech he said : "If you say install, I say install. We have reached a crisis, or soon will, when it will be decided whether we are to have a government of law or be at the mercy of a gang of outlaws. I feel satisfied that it is incumbent on the people to meet this issue like men who dare maintain their manhood. There is no parallel to the outrages committed at this election. The people should see that he is installed. A man lawfully elected should take and hold the office." This plucky speech was received with applause, and resolutions were adopted calling a ! mass convention to be held in Little Rock } upon the assembling of the Legislature, at which time we may expect to hear exciting news from the Rackensack State, as the delegates will doubtless attend armed and equip- i ped for battle. The Radicals are equally de-1 termined, and as they have a majority in the Legislature, which body is to decide the election for Governor, it is safe to presume that! Baxter will be declared duly elected, when the Brooks party will let slip their dogs ofj! war, and unless the Federal Government in- i terferes, it is likely that the muddle will end :1 in rioting and bloodshed, and the State be re-, manded back to military rule.

On Monday last the Sheriff sold, under the orders of the Judge of Probate, a tract of land, for partition among the heirs?at-law of Win. Smith, deceased. The tract is situated on Susybold Creek, and contains one hundred and forty-eight acres. It was purchased by Reuben Cranford at three dollars per acre. We have heard of no other sales.

The information which led to the frustration of his design, was communicated to the Sherriff by Robert T. Riggins, one of the prisoners confined in the jail under a sentence for three years. We are informed that this is the third instance in which Riggins has prevented the escape of prisoners where he was confined; once from the jail in Columbia and twice from the jail of this county. RELEASED. Dr. T. B. Whitesides, of this county, who on the 27th of December last was sentenced to one year's imprisonment by the United States Circuit Court, on the charge of kukluxing, reached this place on Saturday afternoon last from the Albany penitentiary. He was discharged about one month before the expiration of his sentence; but for what reason we have been unable to definitely ascertain. It is rumored, however, that it was in consequence of his uniformly good conduct while a prisoner. We hope that a number of the other prisoners, who were convicted of minor offenses, may soon be pardoned by the President and permitted to return to their UULUtSJ.

A fine band of music had been engaged by the managers, and a bountiful supper had been provided; indeed, every preparation had been made by the different committees to hail the Commencement season with joy and gladness. About eight o'clock the guests began to gather in the brilliantly illuminated and tastefully dressed halls. Expectancy ran high, and "a thousand hearts beat happily." Swells of voluptuous music now filled the rooms, and in accord with it were the "movements gay and sprightly" of the light fantastic toe? "Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again, And all went merry as a marriage bell." At one o'clock the supper was served?an elegant and sumptuous repast?to which all did their devoir, even those over whom the power of music had no charm. The dance was then renewed, and was kept up about an hour, after which the party dispersed to their homes, to rest in the arms of Morpheus, and meet again in the land of dreams. X. Raleigh Term of the U. S. District Court. The United States uistnct uourt, Judge Brooks presiding, has been in session in Raleigh for the past two weeks, though the proceedings of the tribunal are so raeagerly reported in the Raleigh papers that we infer but little business has been transacted. The most prominent case before the Court is the indictment of Hon. Josiah Turner, editor of the Sentinel, charged with being implicated in the ku-klux conspiracy. Mr. Turner, in his paper, expresses anxiety for his trial to come on, and complains because it was continued to next term. In ordering the continuance of the case, Judge Brooks announced that he would not hear it, but leave it to be tried by Judge Bond. Judge Brooks charged the grand jury that the editor of the Sentinel is liable to indictment for violation ofi an act of Congress to prevent and punish the ; obstruction of the administration of justice in the courts of the United States.

The Court then adjourned until Friday morning, at 10 o'clock. Fridat, November 29, 1872. The Court re-assembled at lOo'clock, Judge Bryan presiding: The respective jurors having answered to their names, the District Attorney desired the Judge to further define the crime of conspiracy, and what constitutes it; more particularly as to what relation the declaration of one conspirator shall have towards others engaged in the same conspiracy; and, also as to what bearing or connection the conspiracy had with the right of suffrage. Also, that the grand jury should be further instructed relative to crimes under the enforcement act. The case of the United States versus Claiborne Hopper, for conspiracy and murder, was resumed, the murder counts being omitted. This case is of the same tenor as those tried a year ago, the defendant being one of the persons named in the bill of indictment, in the Tom Roundtree murder. Witnesses were put upon the stand to prove the good character of Roundtree; that he was a colored man, and a leading Republican in the northwestern portion of York county, and that for this he was persecuted and murdered by members of a conspiracy, of which the defendant was one. Only two witnesses were called by the government yesterday, viz: Senator White and Mr. Hammond, of York, after which the government closed their testimony. Considerable discussion followed btween Mr. Thompson, counsel for defense, and the Dis' 1! iL. C -C inci Attorney, regaruiug tne iurm ui piwodure, as counsel for defense intimated that he might not desire to put any witness upon the stand. The Judge, after a somewhat lengthy review, decided that the same rules governing State Courts should govern in the present case: Mr. Corbin then argued the case before the jury, that one of the purposes of the ku-klux was to hinder colored citizens in their right to vote, and that Hopper was a member of the conspiracy. Some little good-natured sparring occurred between counsel during the argument, arising from a statement made by the District Attorney to the effect that it was a tacit acknowledgment of guilt on the part of defendant, because he did not take the stand. Mr. J. S. R. Thompson followed for the defense. Judge Bryan made a thorough charge to the jury, and they retired to their room, returning after about two hours' absence, a verdict of not guilty. The Judge gave notice to the Bar that he would devote to-morrow to the hearing of civil cases. John G. Gaffney, conspiracy, <fcc., against Thomas Roundtree. A scire facias was issued on the bail bond, returnable on the 15th of December next. J. T. Walker alias Jerry Walker, conspiracy. Continued by consent.
