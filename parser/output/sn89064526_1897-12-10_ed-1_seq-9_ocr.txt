WASHINGTON, CURRENCY LEGISLATION. Now tho Tat- IT in Out of tlm Wnjr, That 1* of r»t Importance. The extra session of this congress which closed July last, enacted important, legis­ lation, mid, while its full effect has not yet been iv ili/.o !, what, it has already ac­ complished assures .is of it:? timeliness and wisdom. T. test its valuo furthor time will bo reqnired, and ihe people, satisfied with its operation and re.iultsjthus l'iir, are in no mind to withhold froiui it a fair trial. Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of congress, the question next pressing for consideration is that of the currency. lteview of Put Flnnnolal Operations. The work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, difficult as it may seem, will appear easier when we recall the financial operations of the government since 1800. On tho :30th day of June of that year we had outstanding demand liabilities in the gum of $788,868,447.41. On the 1st of Jan­ uary, 1879, these liabilities had been re­ duced to $443,881),405.83. Of our interest bearing obligations the figures are even .mo'-e striking. On July 1. 1806, the principal of the interest bearing debt of the government was $2,333,331,208. On the 1st day of July, 18'A this sum had been reduced to $585,037,100, or an aggre gate reduction of $1,747,204, 108. Tho in­ terest bearing debt of the United States on the 1st day of December, 1897, was $847,3(15,620. The government money now outstanding (Dec. 1) consists of $340,681, 016 of United States notes, $107,793,280 of treasury notes issued by authority of tho law of 1800, $:i84,0iW,."»03 of silver certifi­ cates and $61,&iO,731 of standard silver dollars. Oscht Not to HxiitHte. "With the great resources of the govern­ ment and with the honorable example of the past before us, wo ought not to hesi­ tate to enter upon a currency revision Tvh ch will make our demand obligations less onerous to the government and re­ lieve iir Jiiianci.il laws from ambiguity ami doubt. The brief review of what was net uplished from the close of the war to 1803 makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of on$ financial abil­ ity or soundness while the situation lrom IS 1 to 1SU7 must admonish congress of the immediate necessity of so legislat­ ing as to make tho return of the condi­ tions then prevailing impossible. A Correct Dlngnoilii tho First Thing. There are many plans proposed as a remedy for the evil. Before we can find the true rornedy we muse appreciate tho real evil. It is not that our currency of every kind is not good, for every dollar o{ It is good good because the governnent's pledgo Is out to keep it so, and that pledge will not be hrokeo. However, the guar­ anty ot our purpose to Keep the pledge will bo best shown fry advancing toward ItB fulfillment. The evil of the present system is found in the great cost the government of maintaining the parity of our different forms of money, that is, keeping all of them at par with gold. We surely can not be longer heedless of the burden this imposes upon the people even under fairly prosperous conditions, while the past four years have demonstrated that it is not only an expensive charge upon the government but a dangerous menacd to the national credit. Cartall Obligations or IiierraM K«Mm. It is manifest that we must devise some plou to protect the government against "bond issues for repeated redemptions. We must either curtail the opportunity for •peculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions of our demand obligations, or increase the gold reserve for their re­ demption. We have $900,000,000 of cur­ rency which the government by solemn enact... .it has undertaken to keep at par with a JHl. Mobodyis obliged to redeem In gold bun th« government. The banks mut j*utsedte wteoa* ia gold. %a* "-V Deo. 6.—Following is tbo first annual message of President McKinley to congress: To the Senate and House of Representa­ tives: It gives me pleasure to oxtend greeting to the Fiftv-fourth congress assembled at the seat of government, with many of whose senators and representatives 1 have been associated in the legislative sorvicc. Their meeting occurs under felicitouu conditions, justifying sincere congratula­ tion and calling for our grateful acknowl­ edgment to a bene/Iceut Providence which has so signally blessed and prospered us as a nation. Pence and good will with all the nations of the earth continue un­ broken. I'atrlotlMn Now Atinv.i Partisanship. A matter of genuino satisfaction is the growing feeling of fraternal regard and unification of all sections of our country, the incompleteness of which has too long delayed realization of the highest bless­ ings of the Union. The spirit of patriot­ ism is universal and is ever Increasing in fervor. The public questions which now most engross us are lifted far above either partizanship, prejudice or former sectional differences. Ihey affect every part of our common country alike and permit of no division on ancient lines. Questions of foreign policy, of revenue, the soundness of tlioeurreucy, the inviola­ bility of national obligations, the im­ provement of the public service, appeal to the individual oonscienre of every earnest citizen to whatever any ho belongs or in whatever section of the country lie may reside. government is obliged lo top equal with gold all its outstanding currency and coin obligations, while its receipts are not re­ quired to be paid In gold. They are paid In every kind of money but gold, and the only meant by which the government can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It can get it in no other way when it most needs it. The government without any fixed gold revenue bi pledged to maintain gold redemption, which It has steadily and faithfully done, and which under the authority now given it will oontinue to do.. Demand* Constant KaplanItltraant. The law which requires the govern­ ment, after having redeemed its United States notes, to pay them out again as current fuuds demands a constant re­ plenishment of the gold reserve. This is ospdolaUy so in fclmes of business panic and when tho revenues are insufficient to meet the expenses of the government. At such times the government has no other way to supply its deficit and main tuin redemption but through the increase of its bonded debt as during tho adminis­ tration of my prodo3essor when $ai2, »15, 4i.) of 4 per cent bonds were issued and sorid and the proceeds used to pay tho ex­ pense of the government in excess of the revenues and sustain tha gold reserve. While it Is true that the greater pan of the proceeds of thoo uonds were us to supply deficient rc/enues, a cotnidu*able portion was required to maintain tbo t,od resorvo. Slum 1 Hiive Authority 'o S«-!t Still.. With our revenues equsil to our expen­ ses, thero would bo no dell it requiring the issuance of bonds, iiut if tne go.d reservo falls below $100,000,000 how Will it be r.-p.uuished excjpt by selling more bonds? Is there nny other way practica­ ble under existing law? The serious question then is, shall wo continue the policy that has been pursued in the past th »t is. when the gold reserve reauhet the pei..i. t.f danger, issue more bums and sup[ ly the needed gold, or shall wo ro viile other means to pie.cut these re curr.ng drains upon the gold reserve? It no further legisl ition is had and ih pol­ icy of selling bonds is to be continued, theii congress should give the seer, t.iry of the treasury authority to soil bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now authorized by law. No Rciiwii. of Note* Except For Gold. I earnest recommend, as soon as the receipts of the government are quite suf­ ficient to pay all the expenses of the gov­ ernment, that when any of the Unitod Suite notos are presented for-redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set upart, and on.y paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If tho holder of United States notes prefers the gold and gets it from the government, he should not receive back from tho government a United Suites note without pay.ng gold In exchange for it. The reason for this is made all tho more apparent when the government issues an interest bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes—a non-interest o^ariug debt. Surely it should not pay them out again, except on demand for gold. If thay are put out in any other way they may return again to be followed by another bond issue to redeem them— another interest bearing debt to redeem a non-interest bearing debt. Government the Ouly Sufferer. In my view it is of the utmost impor­ tance that the government should be re­ lieved from the burden of providing all the gold required for exchanges and ex­ port. This responsibility is alone borne by the government without any of the usual and necessary banking powers to help itself. The banks do not feel the strain of gold redemption. The whole strain rests upon the government and tho size of tho gold reserve in the treasury has come to lie, with or without reason, the signal of danger or of security. This ought to be stopped. if we are to have an era of prosperity In the country with sufficient receipts for the expenses of the government we may feel no immediate embarrassment from our present currency but the danger still exists and will be ever present menacing us so long us the existing system con­ tinues. And besides, it is in times of ade­ quate revenues and business tranquility that the government should prepare for the worst. We cannot avoid without serious consequences the wise considera­ tion and prompt solution of this question. Calls Attention to Mr. Gage's flan. Tho seeretary of the treasury has out­ lined a plan in great detail for the purpose ot removing the threatened recurrence of a depleted gold reserve and save us from future emharrassment on that account. To this plan I invite your careful consid­ eration. I concur with the secretary of the treas­ ury in his recount, jml.itlon that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the facu value of the bonds which they have deposited for circulation and that tax ou circulating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one-half of 1 per cent per annum. I also join him in recommending that authority be given for tho establishment of national banks with a minimum capitul of $25,000. This will enable the smaller villages and agricultural regions of the country to be supplied with currency to meet their needs. I recommend that the issue of national bank notes be restricted to the denomina­ tion of $lo and upwards. If the sugges­ tions I have herein made shall have the approval of congress then I would recom­ mend that national banks be required to redeem the notes in gold. THE 

CUBAN QUESTION. It Is the Moat Important of Any Per­ taining to Foreign Relatione. The most important problem with which this government is now called upon to deal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection. Problems and condi­ tions more or less in common with those now existing have confronted this govern­ ment at various tunes in tne past, ine story of Cuba for manyjears has been one of unrest and growing disoontent an ef­ fort toward a larger enjoyment of liberty and self-control of organised resistance to the mother country of depression after distress and warfare and of ineffectual settlement, to be followed by renewed re volt. For no enduring period sinoe the enfranchisement of the continental pos­ sessions of Spain in the western continent has the condition of Cuba or the poUoy of Spain toward Cuba not caused Motion concerning the United States. The prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain's hold upon the island and the political vicissitudes and embar­ rassments of the home government might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a conti­ nental power, called forth, between 1823 ind 1860 various omphalic declarations of the policy of *ihe United Statu to permit WEEKLY TKAJMRJJttiPT# IsITttJfc *MMU^ ho disturbance of Cuba's connection with Spain unless In the direction of independ­ ence or acquisition by the United States through purchase nor has there been any cha ige this deolarod policy since upon the part of tho government. The Ten Wmr. The revolution, which be^an in 186$, lasted for ton years, despite the stren­ uous efforts of tho successive peninsula!" governments to suppress it. Then, as no iv, tho government of the United States testified its great concern and offered its aid to put an eud to bloodshed in Cubp. The overtures made by Genneral Grant were refused, and the war dragged on. entailing great loss of life and treasure and increased injury to American Inter­ ests, besides throwing enhanced burdens of neutrality on the government. In 1878 peace was brought about by the truce of Zanjon, obtained by negotiations be­ tween the Spanish commander, Martinez de Campos, and the insurgent leaders. Tiie Present usurreet'on. The present insurrection broko out in February, 18»5. It Is not my purpose at this time to recall its remark-able increase or to characterize its tenacious resistance to the enormous foreign avmy enmassed against it by Spain. The revolt and the efforts to subdue it carried destruction to every quarter of the Island, developing v.ide proportions and defying tho efforts of S a a lor its suppression. The civilized a.: e\'war has been disregarded, no less by Spaniards than by the Cubans. The existing conditions cannot but fiU this government and the Anurlcau people nit gravest apprehension. There is no desire on the part of our people to profit by thj misfortunes of Spain. We have nly tho desire to see tho Cubans prosper­ ous and contented, enjoying that measure cf self-control which is the inalienable ri^ht of man protected In their right to r.:ap tho boue'its of the exhaustless treas­ ures of their country. Tho offer made by my predecessor in Apnl, 1896, tendering tho friendly offices of this government failed. Any mediation on our part was not accepted. In brief, tho answer was: "Thero is no effectual way to pacify Cuba unless it begins with the actual submission of the rebels to the mother country." Then ouly could Spain act in the prom­ ised direction of her own motion and after hor own plan. The Cruel Policy of Concentration. The cruel policy of concentration was Initiated Feb. 1(3, 189S. The dlstslcts con­ trolled by the Spanish armies were de­ populated. The agricultural inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison towns, their lands laid waste and their dwellings destroyed This policy the late cabinet of Spain justified as a nocessary measure of war and as a means of cutting off supplies from tho insurgeuts. It has utterly failed as a war measure. It was not civilized warfare. It was extermina­ tion. H.t. Repeatedly Protested. Against this abuse of rights of war I have felt constrained on repeated occa­ sions to enter the firm and earnest pro­ test of this government There was much of public condemnation of the treatment of American citizens by alleged illegal arrests and long imprisonment awaiting trial or pending protracted judicial pro­ ceedings. I folt it my first duty to make instand demand for the release or speedy trial of all American citizens under ar­ rest. Before the change of the Spanish' cabinet in October last, 33 prisoners, citizens of the Unitod States, hud been given their freedom. For the relief of our own citizens, suffering because of the con­ flict, the aid of congress was sought in a special message, and under tho appropria­ tion of April 4, 1807, effective aid has been given to American citizens in Cuba, many of them at thoir own request having been returned to the United States. Minister Wdodford's Instructions. The instructions given to our new min­ ister to Spain before his departure for his post directed him to impress it upon that government the sincere wish of the Unit­ ed States to lend its aid toward the end­ ing of the war in Cuba by reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and hon­ orable alike to Spain and the Cuban peo­ ple. These instructions recited the char­ acter and duration of the contest, the widespread losses it entails, the burdens and restraints it imposes upon us, with constant disturbance of national interests and tho injury resulting from an indefinite continuance of this state of things. It was stated that at this juncture our government was constrained to strenu­ ously inquire if the time was not ripe when Spain, of her own volition, moved by her own interests and every sontiment of humanity, should put a stop to this de­ structive war and make proposals of set­ tlement honorable to herself and just to her Cuban colony. It was urged that a neighboring nation with largo interests in Cuba could be required to wait only a reasonable time for the mothericountry to establish its authority and restore order within the borders of tho island that wo could not contemplote as Indefinite period for the accomplishment of this result. No Humiliation in the Proposal. No solution was proposed to which tho slightest idoa of humiliation to Spain could attach, and, indeed, precise pro­ posals wore withheld to avoid embarrass­ ment to that government. All that was asked or expected was that some safo way might bo speedily provided and perma­ nent ye ice restored. It so chanced that tho consideration of this offer addressed to the same Spanish administration which had declined tho tenders of my predocessor and which for more than two years had poured men and treasure into Cuba in the fruitless effort to suppress the revolt, fell to others. Between the departure of General Woodford, the new envoy, and his arrival in Spain, the statesman who had shaped the policy of his country fell by thelpndof anassassin, and although the cabinet of the late prem­ ier still held office and received from our envoy the proposals he bore, that cabinet gave place within a few days thereafter to a new adminstration under the leadership of Sagasta. Ia the Direction ot Better Understanding. The reply to qpr note was reoeivsd on the 83d of October. It is in the dlreetlon of a better understanding. It appreciates the friendly proposals of this government. It admits that our country is deeply af fso ted by the war in Cuba and that its de­ sire for peace is just It declares that the present Spanish government is bound by every consideration to a change of policy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end Spain has decided to put into enect the pouueat reforms Heretofore aa vocated by the present premier, without halting for any consideration in the path which in it9 judgment leads to peace. The military preparations will continue, it is said, but will be humane and be conduct­ ed with all regard for private rights, being accompanied by political aotlon leading UfUtomSOTA, 

FRIDAY. DEO. 10, 1897. the autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish sovereignty. The immediate amelioration of existing 1 conditions under tho new administration of Cuban affairs is predicted and there withal the disturbance, and all occasion for any change of attitude on the part of the United states. Have Done Oar Daty as to Filibuster*. Discussion of the question of the inter­ national duties and responsibilities of the United States, as Spain understands thoin, is presented, with an apparent dis­ position to charge us with fuiiure in this tegard. This charge is without any basis in tact. It could not have bejn made if Spain had been cognizant of tiie constant efforts this government has ide, at the cost of millions and by tho employment of the administrative niactuuury of the nation at command to perform its |ill duty, according to the law of nations. Due response to this chai-jb has been made in diplomatic course. Throughout all these horrors and dan­ gers to our own peace this government has never broken nor in any way abro­ gated its sovereign prerogative of reserv­ ing itself the determination of its pol­ icy and course according to its own high seu.se of right and in consonance with the clearest interests and convictions of our own people, should the prolongation of the strife so demand Tliree Uutr.ctl Jk»ea*ures Yet Keinaln. Of the untried measures there remain only: Hejogmtion of the insurgents as belligerents, recognition of the independ­ ence of Cuba neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compro­ mise between the contestants and inter­ vention in favor of one or the other party. 1 speak not of forcible annexation, for that cannot bo thought of. That by our cede of morality would bo criminal ag­ gression. The 4)il«iatiou of Belligerency. Recognition of the belligerency of the Cuoan insurgents has otten been can­ vassed as a possible if not inevitable seep both in regard to tho previous 10 years' struggle and during the present war. I am not unmindful that tha two houses of congress in the spring of 189(i expressed i.ie opinion by concurrent resolution that a condition of public war existed requir­ ing or justifying the recognition of tho state ot belligerency in Cuba and during the extra session tne senate voted a joint resolution of like import, which, how­ ever, was not brought to a vote in the house of the representatives. In tiie presence of these significant expressions of the legislative branch it behooves the executive to sjberly consider tne conditions under which so important a measure must need rest for jus.iucation. it is to be seriously consid­ ered wnether the Cuban insurrection pos­ sesses beyond dispute the attributes of statehood, which alone can demand the recognition of belligerency in its iavor. Possession, in short, of the essential qual­ ifications of sovereignty by the insurgents, and the conduct of tho war by them ac­ cording to the reserved code of war are no less important factors toward the de­ termination of belligerency than are the influences and consequences of the strug­ gle upon the international policy of the recognizing state. KecMlls Grant'* Utterances. THeiitterancesof President Grant in his memorable message of Dec. 7, 1879, are signally relevant to the present situation in Cuba, and it may be wholesome now to recall them. The conditions were the same then as now except that the war had been longer continued and the devastation even greater. Tho conclusions of Presi­ dent Grant were at that time, however, against recognition of belligerency, be­ cause he did not believe it in fact existed, as belligerency is understood by the law of nations. Praetionl Aspnnts of Recognition. Turning to the practical aspects of a recognition of belligerency and reviewing its inconveniences and positive dangers, still further pertinent considerations appear. In the code of nations there is no such thing as a naked recognition of belligerency unaccpmpanied by the as­ sumption of international neutrality. Such recognition without more will not confer upon, either party to the domestic oonflict a status not theretofore actually possessed, or affoct the relation of either party to other states. The act of recogni­ tion usually takes the form of a solemn proclamation of neutrality which recites the de facto condition of belligerency as its motivo. It announces a domestic law on neutrality in declaring state. It as­ sumes international obligations of a neu­ tral in tho presence of a public state of war. It warns all citizens and others within the jurisdiction of the proclaimant that they violate those righteous obliga­ tions at their own peril and cannot expect to be shielded from the consequences. The right of visit and search on the seas and seizure of vessels and cargoes and contraband of war and good prize under admiralty law must under international law'be admitted as a legitimate conse­ quence of a proclamation of belligerency. While uccording the equal belligerent rights defined by public law to each party in our ports disfavors would be imposed on both whioh, while nominally equal would weigh heavily in behalf of Spain herself. Would Be Bad tor Cab*. Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of Cnba her maritime rights could be asserted not only for the military in­ vestment of the island but up to the mar­ gin of our own territorial waters and a condition of things would exist for which the Cubans within their own domain oould not hope to create a parallel while its creation through aid or sympathy from within our domain would be even more impossible than now with the additional obligations of international neutrality we would perforae assume. The enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would only be influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and applicable by our own instrumentalities. It oould Impart to the United States no Jurisdiction be­ tween Spain and the insurgents. It would give the United States no right of inter­ vention to enforce the conduct of the strife within this paramount authority of Spain according to the International code of war. For these reasons I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cu­ ban ln? ir.c-it-i TV-.\*

The supposition of an In­ definite prolongation of the war is de nied will take it •uoMntavlaa Grounds. A new new government has taken office in the mother country. It is pledged in advance to the declaration that all the effort in the world cannot suffice to maintain peace in Cuba by the bayonet that vague promises of reform after subjugation af- uluiiaa a# ALa ImomIow nMlhlOtYl* ford no solution of the insular problem: that with a substitution of ooin manders must come a chanSe In the past systemSof warfare for one in harmony with a new poUoy which shall no longer aim to drive the Cubans to the "horrible alternative of taking to the thicket or succumbing In misery that reforms must be instituted In accordance with the needs and circumstances of the time and that these reforms, while designed to give full autonomy to the oolony and to oreate a virtual entity and self controlled ad­ ministration, shall yet conserve and af­ firm the sovereignty of Spain by a distri­ bution of powers and burdens upon a basis of mutual interest untainted by methods of selfish expediency. The first acts of the new government lie In these honorable paths. The policy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the universal sentiment of humanity has been reversed. Under tho now military commander a broad clem­ ency is profferred. Measures have already been sot on foot to relive the horrors of starvation and decrees for tho application of|ihe foreshadowed reforms have already been promulgated. Recession With Honor Impossible. That the government of Sagasta has entered upon a courso from whbh reces­ sion with honor is impossible ean hardly be questioned that in the few weeks it has existed it has made earnest of tho sincerity of Jts professions is not undoni able. I shali not impugn its sincerity, nor should inpatience be suffered to em­ barrass it in the task it has undertaken. It is honestly due to Spaiu and to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations and to prove the asserted efficacy of the new order of things to which she stands irrevocably commit­ ted. The near future should demonstrate whether the indispensable condition of a righteous peace, just aliks to the Cubans and to Spain as wel I as equitable to all our interests so iuti imr.ely involved in the welfare of Cuba is likely to be ob­ tained. If not. tho :igem of further and other action bv th United States will remain to bo taken. V\ \en that time comes that action will be ilevermined in the line of indisputable right and duty. It will be faced, without misgiving or hesitancy, in the light of the obligation this government owes to itself and to the peop.e who havo confided to it the protec tection of their interests and honor and to humanity. ANNEXATION OF HAWAII. Ratification of the Treaty Negotiated Is Considered Desirable. By a special message dated the 16th day of June last 7 laid beforp the senate a treat7 signed that day by the plenipoten­ tiaries of the United States and of the republic of Hawaii having for its purpose the incorporation of" the Hawaiiau isl­ ands as an integral part of the United States and under its sovereignty. While consistently disavowing from a very early period any aggressive policy of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series, of declarations through three-quarters of a century has proclaimed the vital interest of the United States, in the independent life of tho isl­ ands and their intimate commercial de­ pendency upon this country. At the same time it has been repeatedly asserted that in no event could the entity of Hawaiian statehood cease by their passage un­ der the dominion or influence of an­ other power than the United States. Un­ der these circumstances the logic of events required that annexation, heretofore of­ fered but declined, should in the ripeness of time come about us the natural result of the strengthening the ties that bind us to those islands and be realized by the free will of the Hawaiian state. That treaty was unanimously ratified without amendment by the senate and president of the republic of Hawaii on the 10th of September last, and only awaits the favorable action of the American sen­ ate to effect the complete absorption of the islands into the domain of the United States. What the conditions of such a union shall be, the political relation thereof to the United States, the character of the local administration, the quality and degree of the elective franchise of the inhabitants, the extension of the fed­ eral laws to the territory, the enactment of special laws to flit the peculiaroondition thereof, the regulation if need be of the labor system therein, are all matters which the treaty has wisely relegated to congress. THE 

MONETARY COMMISSION. Work of Messrs. Wolr-ott, .Stevenson and Paino Reviewed Under the provisions of the act of con­ gress approved March 8, 181)7, for tho pro­ motion of international agreement re­ specting bimetallism, I appointed on the 14th day of April, 18 )7, Hon. Edward O Wolcott of Colorado, Hon A'ilai E. Stevenson of Illinois and Hon. (. Iiar'c.s .J. Paine of Massachusetts as special envoys to represent the United States. They have been diligent in their efforts to se­ cure the co-dperatioh of European coun­ tries In the international settlement of the question, but up to this time have not been able to .secure an agreement contem­ plated by their mission. The gratifying action of our great sister republio of France In joining thiB coun­ try in the attempt to tring about an agreement among the principal commer­ cial nations of Europe whereby a fixed and relative value between gold and sil­ ver shall be secured, furnishes assur­ ances that we are not alone among the larger nations of the world in realizing the international character of the prob­ lem and in the desire of reaching some wise and practical solution of It. The British government pubUshed a resume «f the steps taken jointly by the French ambassador in London and the speoial envoys of the United States, to whom our ambassador at London Actively co-operated in the presentation of this subject to her majesty's govern­ ment.' This will be laid before congress. Our speoial envoys have not made their final report, as further negotiations be­ tween tiie representatives of this govern­ ment and the governments of other coun n-'p fn contemplation. Mve been -inst-h.- Mssfbflity of maintaining the staMIltyo# tiie pMity between the metals and kin* dred questions may yet be solved lp fur­ ther negotiations. Meanwhile it gives me satisfaction to state that the speoial envoys have already demonstrated their ability and fitness to deal with the subject, and it is to he-hoped that their labors may result in an inter national agreement whioh will bring about recognition of both gold and silver as money upon suoh terms and with such safeguards as will secure the use of both metals upon a basis whioh shall work no injury to any olass of our citizen* Protection mt teal*. The efforts which had been made dup­ ing the two previous years by my prede­ cessor to secure better protection to the fur seals in the North Pacific '.ocean and Bering sea weft renewed at an early' data by this administration and have been pur­ sued with earnestness. Conferences with Japan, Russia and Great Britain have been held and further negotiations will be had for the preserva­ tion and restoration of the seal herd, the result of which it is hoped may be re­ ported to congress at an early day. International Arbitration. International arbitration cannot be omited from the list of subjects claiming our consideration. Events have only served to strengthen the general views or. this question expressed in my ineugural address. The best dentimeot of the civ­ ilized world is moving toward the settle­ ment of differences between nations with­ out resorting to tho horrors of war. Treaties embodying these humane princi­ ples on broad lines without in any way imperiling our interests or our honor shall hive my coustant encouragement. A liberal appropriation is bospoken, in order that the United States may make a creditable exhibit at the approaching Paris exposition, in which the people have shown an unprecedented interest. Needs of the Navy. Under the head of the navy, the presi­ dent points to the necessity for speedy legislation to procure the armor for three battleships now building which would be otherwise useless. Ho speaks in terms of praise of the quality of our ships and thinks the time has now arrived when the increase to which the country isconimitted should for a time take the form of increased facilities commensurate with the increase of our naval vessels. He re­ fers to the lock of Hocks and urges that three or four of the largest docks be pro* vided on the Atlantic and at least one on the Pacific coast and a floating dock on the gulf. Alaskan Matter*. Attention is called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and the extension of civil authority within the territory. There is need for surveys and for the establishment of another land office at some point in the Yukon valley for which an appropriation is asked. Mili­ tary force is also necessary and the estab­ lishment of some sort of flexible govern­ ment. If the startling reports as to the probable shortage of food for the miners oe fully verified, every effort should be made at any cost to carry them relief. The Indian Territory Difficulty. The message deals at some length with the unsatisfactory condition of affairs in the Indian Territory. The large white element is said to be without protection aud without schools or other rights of citizens leading Indians have absorbed great tracts of lands and created an aris­ tocracy and the friends of the Indians be­ lieve that the b-'st interests of the Five Civilized Tribes would be foum} in Amer­ ican citizenship. Reference is made to the failure so far of the Dawes commis­ sion to secure the consent of the tribes to an extinguishment of the tribal titles and a division of the lands. It is said that should the tribes still fail to ratify the agreement then some legislation should be had by congress. Kansas Pnelllc Sale. Speaking of the pending sale of the Kansas Pacific railroad it is said that if no better bid is received than the upset price fixed by the court the government would receive only *3,500,000 on its claim of nearly $12,000,000. He believes that the government has the authority to bid on the road and has directed the secretary of the treasury to make the deposit of $900,000 required to qualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum at least equal to the principal of the debt to the govern­ ment. He suggests, however, that in a matter so important as the government becoming a possiole owner of the railroad, congress should enact some legislation to define its views. It is clear to him, how­ ever, that the government should not permit the property to be sold at a price less than one-half the principal of its debt and less than one-fifth of its entire debt, principul and interest. The Civil Service. The president devotes the last chapter of his message to the civil service, the practical improvement of which, he says, has long been a subject of earnest discus sion, and which has of late years received increased legislative and executive ap­ proval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon a still firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. Whi.c the right of deserving vet­ eran soldiers to reinstatement has been asserted, dismissals for merely, political reasons hav« been carefully guarded against the examinations improved and made practical, and a distinct advance has been made by giving a hearing before dismissal upon all cases where incompe­ tency is charged or demand made for the removal of officials. This last has been. done without impairing the power of re­ moval, one of the vital safeguards of the syutem. Much remains to be done before the system can be perfected, and the pres­ ident says that he shall not hesitate to exempt cases which he thinks havo been properly included in the classified service or include those which in his judgment will best promote the pubUo servioe. The system has the approval of the people It wlU be his endeavor to uphold and ax tend it. Department Be port*. Concluding the message, the president says: I am forced by the length, of this mes­ sage to omit many important references to affairs of the government with which congress will have to deal at the present session. They are fully discussed in the departmental reports, to all of which I in vite your earnest attention. The estimates of the expense of '::1 W I ill "\k vths government by'the several.! departments will, I am sure, have your careful scrutiny. -While the oongress may not find it an easy task to re­ duce the expense of the government, it should not encourage their increase.' These expenses will, in my judgment, ad­ mit of a decrease in many branches of the government without injury to the publioj service. It is a commanding 1 -try to keep1 the appropriations wlihin Uiu receipts of the (^'VClxiiUCul iiLiii UUO v. oid a deiwih j|
