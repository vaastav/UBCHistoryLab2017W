The first skirmish in the war on the civl service law was pulled off in the house last week, and it was lively while' it lasted. A conference of all members of the house who desire change in ths law is to be held, in or der to arrange for an organized at tack. President MeKinley's conciliatory lansuage in his message, where he re fers to Spain has caused a correspond ent to remark that if Spain isn't en tirely pleased with the situation at the Washington end of the line, she must be hard to please. It was a new thing for a p- esident of the United States to derate nearly half of his message to congress to an argument in favor of allowing a foreign nation more time in which to try to squeeze the life out of a people residing in sight of our coast, and the innovation was nauseous to many. A dose equally nauseous fol lowed, when Secretary Gage presented several columns of solid newspaper scatter, giving in detail the extraordi nary efforts of this country to aid Spain by suppressing filibustering. Senator Alien offered a resolution in the senate for the recognition of Cuban indepandence, but it is feared that the committee on foreign relations, to which it was referred, will pigeon-hole it- A week or two ago we had occasion to say that the Ansonia Sentinel, as guided by Editor J, M. Emerson, was all wool and a yard wide. When the editor of the Sentinel makes an error, and that Is not often, he is willing to correct it, if possible, and that is more than some editors not a thousand miles rom Waterbury are willing to do. On a recent occasion, two local editors not only libeled a gentleman, but when told they did bo, they failed to make the 'amende honorable," or to offer any 30rt of an apology, whatever. Herein they differ from the editor down the road, for when he made a mistake he corrected it in the following manner:. 'We owe an apology to the Rev Dr Joseph Anderson of Waterbury, and we are frank enough to say we made a mistake. It was an oversight, how ever, and the reverend gentleman knows enough about newapaper mak ing to understand that busy editors do not always have time to read every ser mon printed in the newspapers, not even when preached by so eloquent e minister as Dr Anderson. In a receni odltorial item we mentioned that the Catholic clergymen bad recently de nounced the boxing contests in Water bury, and aaked: 'Why do not the Protestant clergymen say a few words against them?' A Waterbury paper re plied that we ought to read Dr Ander- eon'a Thanksgiving sermon. We have done so now, hence the apology." 

CURRENT COMMENT. A wire trust Is the latest, and J. Pier- pent Morgan, who is an old hand ai wire pulling, is at the had of it. In one province of Cuba, Matanzas, ten thousand people have died, the most of them from starvation, in ten months. Still 'Mr McKinley tells con gress to keep its hands off. The gullible newspaper readers of the country will be saved untold mil lions of dollars by the decision of the postoffice department to deny such newspapers as print advertisements of lottery schemes, under the name of guessing or missing letter contests, the privilege of going through the mail at pound rates. . , .

MAY GET THKOUGH APRIL 1 Appropriation Bills Ordered to lie nurnen 1 11 v u II II H rrienua Block ilie Speaker- Schemes The Civil-Service Fight. Washington, Dec. 13. It is given out upon the authority of members very close to Speaker Reed that all the ap propriation bills, save two the Sundry Civil and Deficiency bills will be put througrh the House'before the loth and possibly before the 1st of April. Tho chairmen of the several committees hr '. 'r.g charge of the annual appropria te .. bills besides the Committee on Ap priaUons have been notified by Speaker Reed to prepare and report their bills not later than Feb. 1. The Speaker is determined to beat the record of short sessions if possible, and as the House rules effectually choke off filibuster! nfj there is the best of reasons to believe that he will succeed in carrying out his policy so far as the House is concerned. There will, of course, be a sharp con test over the River and Harbor bill, and in spite of the Speaker's efforts the bill reported from the committee, of which Mr. Hooker, of New York, is chairman, will be loaded down in the Committee of the Whole and further increased in the Senate. The terms of several Senators expire with this Con gress, and they will, it Is believed, "pool their issues," and as usual se cure large increases for rivers and harbors in their respective States, most of yhich will disappear in conference, for the bill, as it reaches the Senate, will greatly exceed a prudent and proper limit. The extra session called by President Cleveland Aug. 7, 1893, did not adjourn until Nov. 3, while the second, or wnat is known as the regular or "long" ses sion, which commenced on Dec. 4, did not terminate until Aug. 28, 1894. Sev eral of the leading Senators have ex pressed the opinion that Congress will certainly remain In session a part of the Summer and that there is little likelihood of an adjournment before Aug. 1. The Senate, however, will de termine the time of adjournment, as it has nearly always done. If the opposition, which includes the Democrats, Populists and Silver Re publicans, shall decide to push the cur rency question forward and also to hold up two or three of the more im portant appropriation bills until a vote has been reached in the House on the Cuban question, then it is certain that Speaker Reed's policy of an early ad journment will come to grief. The Speaker is said to urge very earnestly the argument that an early adjourn ment means less appropriations as well as less trouble for the Administration, though it is given out that the Speaker will antagonize the President on the question of the annexation of Hawaii. 

ANNEXATION IN THE SENATE. Supporters of the 1)111 Will Consider It in Executive Session. Washington, Dec. 13. The supporters of Hawaiian annexation have definitely decided to consider the question in ex ecutive session of the Senate,, In order to do this it will be necessary for them to take up the annexation treaty rath er than a joint resolution providing for annexation. Some few of those who support Hawaii in this matter were at first inclined to believe that unless it became evident that the two-thirds vote necessary to secure the ratifica tion of the treaty was assured from the beginning it would be a waste of time to take the matter up at all upon the basis of the treaty, but they ap pear to have changed their minds, and to be at least disposed to defer to the opinions of the majority, who oppose this course. It is now stated on be half of the pro-annexationists that to abandon the treaty at the present time would create the impression that they had surrendered the fight entirely. The stanchest friends of annexation admit that it will be well nigh impossi ble to secure the two-thirds vote neces sary to ratify the treaty, but they con tend that they will come very near reaching the necessary .number. The House bill to prevent the free use of timber on the public lands for commercial purposes Is being consid ered by the House Committee on Pub lic Lands. The bill was passed by the House heretofore, but killed in the Sen ate. Mr. McRae, of Arkansas, the au thor of the bill, is confident of its pas sage in the House, and believes that the recent aggTessions on the Govern ment's timber in the Western States will tend to secure favorable action in (1 the Senate. 

ATTACK CIVIL SERVICE. Kepnblican CtfagreMmcn Devlsins Means to Alter the Present Law, Washington, Dec. 13. A meeting of Republican Representatives in Con gress was held Saturday night at the River and Harbor Committee rooms to devise means for securing a change in the present civil-service law. About sixty members were present, represent ing most of the States having Republi can delegations in Congress. It was noticeable, however, that Speaker Reed, Mr. Dingley and other leaders of the House did not attend. Representative Hepburn acted as chairman. The dis cussion took a wide range. The main speakers were Grosvenor, Connolly, Evans, Farls, Mahaney and Darr. It was determined to name a commit tee to "examine the bills pending be fore the Committee on Reform of the Civil Service and report to a subse quent meeting of this conference by bill or otherwise." Mr. Grosvenor is chairman of the committee. The advisability of attack ing the civil-service items in the Legis lative, Executive and Judicial Appro priation bill, which will come before the House this week, was discussed, but opinion was against that course. Representative Brosius, who Is chair man of the Committee on Reform of the Civil Service, said yesterday morn ing that the law would not be modified to any appreciable extent, and he doubted if any legislation would be en acted on the subject of civil service at this session. Other leaders, including Dingley, of Maine; Cannon, of Illinois, and Johnston, of Indiana, exnrosed the same opinion. ' P .

Examined nt rienfnrgon at Sugges tion of I'niteuL States Consul. Havana, Cuba, via Key West, Fla, Dec. 13. Reliable reports state that American citizens in Cienfuegos and that vicinity are indignant over the searching of the American steamer Santiago at that port by the police and civil guards. The indignation was heightened because the alleged search was made at the suggestion of Ameri can Consul McGarr. It is charged against Air. McGarr that he Informed the authorities that, in his judgment, a search would result in finding insurgent correspondence. As a matter of fact, the police discovered nothing suspicious. Since the capture of Caimanera by the insurgents, and the recapture of Guisa by the Spanish, there has been a lull in military operations in the East. Denial of Atrocities. The Spanish official report of appall ing atrocities committed by the insur gents in Guisa Is declared by members of the Junta to be a stupid falsifica tion. They point out that it is unrea sonable to suppose that women and children were burned alive when among the inhabitants there must have been the families of rebel soldiers, and the Spanish soldiers were spared and taken prisoners. The Palace officials say the story of atrocities is fully con firmed, but are unable to furnish any details. ' Spanish Paper Warlike. Madrid, Dec. 13. The Imparclal pub lishes a strong article in which It de clares Spain will not accept the right of President McKinley to Intervene in Cuba in case the war is prolonged, and demands that the Government adopt "the same energetic attitude towards the United States as Germany adopted towards Hayti, because President Me Kinley's message Is equivalent to ques tioning the right of Spain's sovereign ty in Cuba." Continuing, the Imparcial insists that Spain must prepare for all eventuali ties, and augment her navy "by or ganizing a subscription in which the whole nation from the Queen to the most humble subject should partici pate."
