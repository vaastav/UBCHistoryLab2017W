liMM^fi Uv SATURDAY, DEC. 17, 1898. WASHINGTON LETTER PRESIDENT HcKlNLEYS SOUTHERN TOUR. Distinguished Visitors. The Census Com? mittee Meets. TO ADJOURN FOR THE HOLIDAYS. More About the Nicarauga Canal. ADMISAL DEWEY'8 WI8HES. (From Our Regular Correspondent.) Washington, D. C.. Deo. 12th, 98. President McKinley does not regard himself as personal guardian of Con? ferees, ss Mr. Cleveland did. There fare he and almost the entire Cabinet, together with members of their fami? lies will go South to-morrow, tobe ?way from Washington eight days, without any fear that Congreta will be frailty of anything very naughty while they are away. His long service in Congress makea President McKinley know how to treat that bedy in such a manner as to keep the good will of its members, regardless of party. It is always a good thine to be able to put yourself io a mao's place when you are ?leafing with him equally good for both parlies, as it tends to treating the oth? er fellow as you would like to be treat? ed yourself. This trip will be relaxa? tion for President McKinley and no ad?.ty will be neglected, sa the original copy of the treaty of Peace, signed Saturday night cannot possibly reach Washington before he gets back. 

IPIAEII BfcBO'l WIT. Speaker Reed uses hia wit without regard to ths etstus of tnose who hap? pen to be with him when he sees sn -opening for it. He was tbe guide of Sir Wilfrid L^urir-r and a number of members nnd attaches of the Canadian American Jo.nt high Comm usion, in abeu tour of the Capitol tue day that -Ona ir man Dingi-" entertained them at a luncheon ia his Committee room. Mr. R*?d procured his vi*uor< dm tl tanee into numerous roo.ru th?.t wouiu not have be*n op-?nei to ordm.ry vi* - tor*, or in fact to ha di? anyooly. ex ?cept upon an order from the Speaker Tftic was appreciated by sir Wilfrid, out when theie was a slight delay at atMi dining ro>m entr-mje, owing to aoame ?*onfu-ion in arrangiug the ta ?bias ard chairs, he thought to h-ve a little fuu st ene speaker's expenae, by aaytng: "Your authority here, Mr. JKeed. doesn't seem to be abiolute." The Speaker's eyes twinkled as he re? plied, in his customary drawl: 'Oh, ii asa't hair trigger, bititw>li be all aright in a minut"." Thn delay was forgotten in the laughter which follow aaal. _ a busibbii aaaaioK. The House showed ita intention to make this a business session by passing two billa?the deficiency appropriation ?jill and tha ami-scalping bill during 'Ita fi rat week, and it ia now pegging at way at the jj. C. Appropriation bill. Representative Berry, of Kentucky, aalthough a democrat, is a red-hut ex Baanaioniat. He says: "If we do not grriv, tnere will be decay. Growth Ortogslife energy and devolopm~nt. Aa to the Philippines, I think a Mili? tary government should continue for a wear until we can determine what kind ot a oermanent government is applica ail*" He House Census Committee held i's first meeting, thia sesoioo today, ?_ od g?t right down to bnetneae. Cnair anan Hopkins of the (oinmittce. s-.ys lie hopes to be able to repirt a bill be lore the Chm tans recess. The Cen ?us bill that waa passed by the .Senate aaa (he last session doei not seem to meet the views o' the members of the members of the House Commicte- in a number cf num or rw*a important p.rt culara, tut it has n t y?t been de *stdrd whether to amend the Senate trill, or to repr.it an entirely lev anea''ti e. One thing appears to he ao asotut-ly certain?rh? employees of the ?Ce4i?ui Bureau will not 1>j put under civil a irv ice rules. B MT8 rOB DI7.IT, Ia response to a request from \d rn.ral Dewey, a number of light draft kui b^ata will be sent to him, they toeing more suitable to the work c( ?Bruising among the numerous Philip? pine islands than the Isree vessels he now has, the most of whieh will be or *sd h mn se fast as they can be spared. Ceristnias packages may be sent to C. rt soldiers in Cuba, Porto Rico, and arie Philippine*, without the payment ?or tariff duties imposed upon other merchandise sent to tho?e islands. By Oireetionof President McKinley, the Warr Department has issued an official order to that effect. Senator Morgan today called up hil BioaraguaCanal bili, which now has exclusive rightofwayin tha Renate viutil disposed of. He H?ys he will puah it until it is paaaed. There is no doubt of tts passage as soon as a vote ii rea the 1 Ton bia makes this govern mont, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, the note owners of the stock of tbe Mari time Canal Company, which holde a eoncession to build the Canal, a major? ity of the stock to be held by this gov or nene nt, which is to guarantee $100 OOO COO in the bondi of tne Compa&y tha be need in ahe construction of thc ajeonl. with exception of 

I5.CO0.OO0 tc 4aa paid to the praaent stock asaanrra ol the Company, for their eon > eeeaion and to recompense mern for money they have already apent on the janal. THB FRBSIDBBT's POWIS. The President alone will have au rho-ity to issue theme bondi, and he may suspend their iasue at any time re'deem-* it prudent to do so. There is a serong lobby in Washington working against this bill, both openly and se? cretly. The secret work is the mest dangerous, because it is apparently in interest of building the Canal, and only agaicst this particular bill; in reality it is against the building of the Canal. Editor Smith Galla oa the Lord. [Cleveland, O. Gazette.] Not a line in the President's message in nundemnation of the recent anarcn istic display in North Carolina that re? sulted in the usurp ttion of a state and many of its local governments; the murier of between 25 and 80 innocent and defenseless citizens and the death of a number of women and children driven by fear from their humble homes into the woods to freeze and starve. None of the oth?r leaders of the re? publican party nor any of the promi? nent statemsn of the country have had anything to say in condemnation of the recent brutal exhibition in the Caro? linas, whieh wa* worse than Weylerism in Cuba. There *eems to be no doubt of it?the Afro-American ii the sacri? fice that ii being offered upon the al? tar of a oloaer union of tbe whites of the north and south, and there ii every indication th-t the republican party has b*cjm? a party to the crime. O Lord! Howlong howlong! Blamed For What He End Not Sty.' I Bolton, Mags. New England To-**'-'* light. I It is not what tbe President did say, but what he did not say that the peo? ple might have a juat cause for com? plaint. We very muib regr-t that a President representing the p?rty of our life rime p ditical faith, and above a:l. the President of the most bo-st-d republic on earth, could, in an annual metaag?, rise to height* so universal ai t > note every existing wrong in for? eign lands, and ye could bow to depths io low, and could lonfl ia himself with? in limit* so narrow th*t he could fi id no ex'use for giving even a slight of a reference to j nt a few of the many open wrongs that exist here within our very threshold. Lacked Ona Essential Point. [Washington, D. C. Bee j! The President's tne???ge was a mag? nificent document, lacking only one essential point. Xmas "Ads," begin now.

"I only knew this mau slightly, and when ho met nie I just nodded, but he l?'?iin to talk about the war." "Do you moan to say that ho is a sympathizer with Spain?" demanded the Justice, glaring at the bandaged man. "So, It wasn't that. We both agreed that Weyler ought to be hm ned at UM stake, and if we hadn't both bad families ara would uo to morrow. Then the talk drifted to oui families, and he began to tell me about the smart remark marie by lils t jaar oki boy. who. whan ba beard of the sailing of tin- (loot, said-" "I understand," said the Judg" baa Illy, preparing to write the magic word "discharged" ou the ror-nrd.

An excellent perfume for use in pack? ing clothes away that will retain its properties for a long time is made by taking a pound of any sachet powder and one ounce each of the following: Cloves, caraway seeds, nutmeg, mace, cinnamon and tonga beans; also as much orris root as will equal the weight of all the foregoing ingredients. Pill small bags made of linen or fine muslin. Old linen harrikprrrd-fg win make nice bags for the purpose. Lay these bags among the garments, and it will give them a soft perfume that will cling to them even through washing. HOMELY OBSERVATIONS. The hinges of true friendship never rust. Pressed corned beef is moye substan? tial than pressed autumn lJeaves. The proud father ls always anxious to give his first baby a-vfeigh. The success of the man who falls for a million is something phenome? nal. A fisherman has plenty- of leisure time in which to think out scaly stor? ies. Some men are of no more conse? quence than a thermometer on a pleas? ant day. There are times when the almighty dollar will not go aa far aa a little po? liteness. Go to the ant, thou sluggard?con? sider her ways, and keep away from your "uncle." After a woman reaches the age of 30 it is impossible to convince her thai the good all die young. The undoing of the work that Satan' finds for idle hands to do furnishes em? ployment for a lot of other people. There are two places in a newspa? per where a man doesn't care to hava bis name appear?tbe obituary column and tbe police court record. HOW DISHES WERE NAMED. Mulllgatawney ls from an East India word meaning pepper water. Waffle is from wafel, a word of Teu? tonic origin, meaning honeycomb. Hominy is from anhuminea, the North American word* for parched corn. Gooselierry fool is a corruption of gooseberry fouls, milled or pressed gooseberries. Foremeat Is a corruption of farce meat, from the French farce, stuffing, I. e.. meat for stiffing. Succotash is a dish borrowed from the Narragansett Indians and called by them m'slckquatash. Blanc-mange means literally white food; hence chocolate blanc-mange is something of a misnomer. Charlotte ls a corruption of the old English word charlyt, which means a dish of custard and charlotte russe Is Russian charlotte. Macaroni is taken from a Greek de? rivation, which means "the blessed dead," in allusion to the ancient cus? tom of eating it at feasts for thc dead. Gumbo is simoly okra soup, gumbo being the name by which okra is often known in the south. Chicken gumbo ls soup ef okra and chicken. HIGH LIGHTS. Occupation keeps us from thinking of what ws would rather do. People of tact never irritate a pes? simist by telling him that he looks happy. The man who wears a wig always puts a false construction upon his own thoughts. Woman likes man to cmoke, because then eke grus a good conversatioual chance at him. The man who has never done any? thing foolish should watch himseif well until he is dead. When a woman al mi ts she is wrong her husband feta Beared and thinks she is going to die. He ealtn in argument; the omer man will then 'ose his head wondering why you dcift get mad. The whole family feels injured when a woman comes home from her sewing society and anya aha didn't hear any The woman who can't get away in sommer always knows some good rea? son why the woman next door ought to have stayed at home.?Chicago Rec? ord. FROM MANY SOURCES. A British antiquarian has discover? ed that Shakespeare was of Welsh de? scent. When a fish has lost any of its scales by a wound or abrasion they are never renewed. Some scientists assert that the pur? est air In cities ls found about twenty five feet above the street surface. It ls now stated ihat the invention of gunboats and armor protected gun* dates back to the fifteenth century. A diamond in constant use for cut? ting cold glasi lasts about three months, but if used to cut hot glass would only last for one day. Early man used to be able to wag his ears as an Indication of pleasure or to brush away flies from under his back hair, hut as the muscles were net brought into continual use they be? came rudimentary. Carbonic oxide being found normally in the blood of living beings existing In Paris, M. Nicloux has demonstrated to the French Academy of Science that gas forms within the organism itself without external causes. MEN AND WOMEN. I Why isn't a good wife a woman pos? sessed ? Why does a girl seldom attempt to extinguish the spark of love? | Some engagements end happily, while others end in marriage. Cold cash melts lots of hearts that are not affected by warm love. The realities of matrimony are usu? ally less pleasing than the Illusions of love. Some bachelors voluntarily join the ranks of the Benedicts and some are drafted. i Ali the classics and metaphors at tha command of a woman school teacher don't prevent her Jumping on a chair at sight of a mouse.
