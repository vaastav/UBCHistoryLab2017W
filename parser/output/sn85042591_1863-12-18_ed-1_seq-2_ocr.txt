Au attempt to guaran toe and protect a revised State of (ovcrninent, constructed Id wholo or preponderating part from tho very clement ftniost whose hostility and violence, it i to bo protected, is Mm ply nbaurd. There must be n test by which to separate opposing do lueiits, so as to build only from the sound, and that test is a sufficient and liberal one, which accept sound whoever will mako a sworn recants tion of his former unsotindnesN. But tr it be proper to require as a test of Admission to the politico! bo dy an oath o( allegiance to the Con utitution of the United States and the Union under it, why not also to the laws and proclamations in regard to slrtverj? Those laws and proclama tions were enacted and put forth for the purpose of nidingin the suppress ion of tho rebellion. To give them tbs fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my Judgement they have aided, and wiil further aid, the cause lor which they were enlisted. To give up this prin ciple would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a ciuel and astounding breach of faith. I may add at this poiut, that whilo 1 remain im my present position, I flhult not attempt to retract or modi fy the Emancipation Proclamation,! nor shall I return to slavery any per son who is marie free by the terms of tho Proclamation, or by any act of Congress. For these, and other rea sons, it is thought best that the sup port of these persons elinll bo inclu ded in the oath, aud it is believed that the Executive may lawfully laim it in return for pardon and the reatoration of protested rights which be has a clear constitutional power to withhold altogether, or grant upon the terras which he shall deem wisest for the public interest. It should be observed, also, that this part of tho. oath is Rubje.et to the modifying aud abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision. The pro posed acquiescence of the National Executive in any honorable tempore ry fetato arrangement for the freed people, is made with a view of possi Uy modifying the confusion and dis tressing destitution which must, at least, attend all classes, by a total revolution of labor throughout the whole .States It is hoped that alrea dy deeply nfllicti d people in those States may be somewhat more rendy to give up tho cause of their allllctioii and to this extent this vital matter is life to themselves, while no power of me national executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by this proposi tion. The suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining thi political frame work of the States on what is called reconstruction, is made in the hope that it may do good without harm. it will favor labor, and avoid great contusion. Hut why any proclnnia tion now upon me suojectr mis question is beset with tho conflicting views that tho step might be delayed too Jong or be taken too soon. In some of the States the elements for resumption have been all ready for action; bat remain inactive, apparent ly for a rallying point or a plan of ac tion. Why shall A. adopt the plan of B . rather than II. that of A? If A. and JJ. should agree, how can they know that the General Government here will respect their plan? By the proc lamation, a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rally ing point, aud which will not bo re jected here. This may bring them to act sooner than otherwise would. Tho objection to a premature presen tation of a plan by the National Ex ecutive, consists in the dangor of com mittals in points which could be more safoly left to further developments. Care has been taken to nlmpe the doc ument as to avoid embarassinent from this source. In saying that, on cer tain terms, certain classes will be par doned, with their rights restored it is not said that other classes, on oth er classes, on other terms, will never bo included. In saying that a recon struction will be accepted, if present ed in a specified way, it is not said that it will bo accepted in no other way. The movements by State ac tion for emancipation, not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, are matters of prolound gratulntion; and, while I do not repeat what I have heretofore so earnestly urged upou this subject, my general views and feelings remaiu unchanged, and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these import ant steps to the great consumotion. In the midst of other cares, how ever important we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our mam reliance, Io that power alone can we loon yet, for a time, to rive confidence to the people in con tehtedreglons.that theinsurgent power will not again overrun tbeui. Until that confidence shall be established. little can be done anywhere, for what is called reconstruction. Hence, our chiefest care must still be directed to our army and navy, who Lave thus far borno their harder part so nobly and well: aud it may bo esteemed for tunate that lu giving the greatest effi ciency to'their indispeusible arms, wo do also honorably encourage gallant tnen, from commander to sentinel, who compose them, and to whom, more than all others, the world must stand Indebted, for the heme of freedom, disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged find perpetuated.

The message of President Lincoln will attract more attention than any document of the kind ever issued. Tho momentous subjects of which it treats, and tho simple, plain, honest and frank manner in which ho meets them will cause it to be read and re read as a most important part of the history of the war. The friends and enemies of the gov- emment will read that nortion devo. ted to reco .trurtlon v-ith intense terest ine lormer win approu it., for while it leaves an open door for peace, it is guarded in such n manner the peace nut be lasting and. . , A ... . pe.-mnent-tLa latter will condemn it becauao 't forces tbe rebels to down their arms, wlien ther do if, in ueh a wav that they can never tsjeen np again. Of course it would be toomnchto expect tho Copper- head fraternity who bellowed 'pcace, on anr terms' over Ohio Inst Fall, to .. .. ., . . accept those, portions that reaffirm the Emancipation Proclamation, tin- excluding the leaders of the rebellion from pardon and tho taking of the out.h. So long as the rebellion had a ... chance of success, so long they advo- cated unconditional surrender to it, and now that its failure and the suc-hc cess of the government is a certainty, , , , . , they desire nothing so much as that it shall be ended in such a manner as to leave the rehelliou9 states as 6trong and in as good condition to com menee again, as ever, They would have a Tree pardon extended to all concerned in it, and, above all, they would have tho creat ennae of it tho root of all this bitterness that has desolated North and South slavery, left untouched, to again deluge the with blood. " But the President, that wis-, loin mid foresight that has marked his career from the beginning, has not only to crush the rc-'ei but to so effectually crush it J and its causo that the peace will be lasting.

Giv,n lmder mv hand Bt th City of Washington, tho eiuhth day of ABRAHAM LINCOLN. By the President: WM. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State. The Situation. At last we have tho definite and posi tive assurance that the rebel General Longstreet has been compelled to a bandon his operations in East Tenn essee, and that he is retreating, with our forces in hot pursuit. The rebel seige of Knoxville has proved au in glorious failure, and the last desperate etiort that the rebels can make to re gain possession of that much coveted region, litis been effectually foiled. Tho arrival of Gen. Sherman, with heavy reinforcements, setles the mat- ter flaiiy, ad if Longstreet succeed in eluding capture, he must thank his flect-footedness. The boundary line between iennessee and North Caroli na now forms the new lineof demurk ation between tho rebellion and our undisputed uiilitrry occupation. 1 tike a loo It at any map ot the United States, and you will see into what nar row limits this circumscribes the ter ritorial domain of the "Southern Con federacy." It cannot bear much more pressure, before it will have to col lapse, lu view of this result of our military operations the whole of Tenuessoo reclaimed, aud the Gulf states menace '.the eeueral military situation assumes a most flat ter inc aspect. General llaHeck has a pur- pose in ordoring so large a force of O rants troops, under Sherman, to Knoxville, and we conjecture that a new programme has been adopted,! looking to a movement into Virginia. from the West, to co-operate with the armies of Meade and Uutler for the . capture of Richmond and theoccupa tton of Virginia and North Carolina. General Grant still has troops enough nt Chattanooga to hold Uragg in check in Georgia, and Itragg cannot rein force Longstreet or Lee for fear of iGrant; anil Lee and Longstreet can not reinforce lirngg for fear of Meade Foster, Sherman butler. If we hear by and by, that Sherman and Foster are moving into North Carolina, and pen tetrating Virginia towards Lynchburg. wo shall lie rrennrcd lor the trood news. The force that Sherman brought up from Chattanooga is larger than is generally supposed, and it means something. If, in the event of this movement towards the rear of Rich mond, Hragg should send reinforco ments northward, Grant will not be slow in taking advantage of the oppor tunity to move into Georgia and Al abama, and plant the "old flag" over the Gulf St-ttfls. The armr of the Potomac, abandon ing its movement against Left's forces, tins sareJy and leisurely recrossed the Rapidan, and is again encamped at Culpepper, and along tho Orngo and Alexandria lailroad. It is laid that Gen. Meade, ascertaining that Lee's intrench no onts were too strong to be successfully attacked, and finding the roads bad, he deemed it prudent to fall back The news from Charleston is cheering. Gilmore's swamp angel is dropping a score ofjflre shells lady info the doom ed city, whose inhabitants have fled its dangerous precincts. It must tall Grant says. 

CONGRESSIONAL. Congress is now in good working order. The Committers are all op pointed, and the work of Legislation is going on. James M. Ashley is Chairman of the Committee on Territory. Dec. 14th. Sematv.. Mr. Wil son introduced a resolution thanking Gen's Hooker and Meade Banks and others and Mr. Doolittle one voting a gold medal to Gen. Grant.

Referred to the Judici ary Committee. Fernando Wood of X. Y. submitted the following: resolution: Whereas, The President in his Mes- sa:e delivered to this House on the 7th inst, in his recommendation to the people assemble at their places of worship io give shouts to God for the recent victories, claims that the Uni- on cause has gained important and substantial advantages, and whereas, in view of these triumphs, it is no beneath our dignity, nor dun- gerous to our safety to evince a gen- magnanimity becoming u great powerful people, by offering to the iusurgents an opportunity to re- turn to the Union without imposing upon them degrading or destructive Resolued, That tho President be re- ers, who shall be empowered to open negotiations with the authorities at Richmond to the end, that this bloo- dy.destructivo and inhuman war sliall cease, and the Union bo restored up on terms of equity, fraternity and equality under the Constitution Mr. Washburne, of 111., moved that resolution be laid ,-n tho table, which was agreed to. Dec. 15th Ssxatk. There was a handsome little skirmish in the Sen- ate on me lOtD. Mr. Davis of Kentnekv. cMa ..m the resolutions in relation to tho ex- change of prisoners, arguing veho- mently against the policy of refusing to exchance our suffering whito sol- diets the languishing, starving and diseased white men, becauso the reb- els refuse to exchange tho negro cap- tives. He denounced at length the policy of the Administration upon the several points in which the neu-ro is affected, characterising its position as monstrous, and referring to the present era as the reio-n of Abraham tho First. He closed with on iudijr- nnnt and earnest protest nainst the refusal of the Administration to liber ate thousands of starving and dying white men for the sake of a few ne gro. The preamble of the Constitu tion confers no power on the Govern ment. The President cannot raise troops or armies, nor has the power to originate any measures to put down insurrection, without the consent ol Congress. It was the determination of the party in power that the war shall continue till tho next Presiden tial election. Tho war would have been brought to a close long ago; if the Administration had sinirlv and in good faith devoted itself to the principles announced in the Critten den resolution; and if commanders of the armies had not been selected, not because of their opposition to Slavo-ry. thilt this special committee also ; Constitution as it is and the Union as t w;ll ftntl not as it h!ls beeu iterpret shall I He wp(lM dispossess the slave so uoiders of Hie Union as he would those jw,,0 Be-Vie( the Chesapeake.

A more atro- allegation against the honors- bio members was never listened to from the beginning of the war to the present moment. If the allcg-.it ion of the Senator's were true, he would sooner take into his hands-the hand a man from the charnel house, reek- ing with pestilence, than the hands off those around him. If the allegation was true, then every Senator was stamped with the foulest treason and perjury.

The Govern ment having used them, and they hav ing been taken prisoners, if they are abandoned to their fate, it is guilty of baseness unheard of in history. The idea that the Administration and its supporters desire the control the next Presidential election is insin uation so base that the wonder is that it has found utterance even from the Senator from Kentucky. In the House, Davis of Md., mov ed that so much of the President's message as rolates to the duty of the United States to guarantee to every State a republican form of government and that relating to those States in which the Government has been abro gated or overthrown, be referred a Select Committee of Nine who shall report the bill9 necessary xo carry imo effect this duty.
