The Natchez Bun has "gone down." The Stale Grange meets at Forest, Tues day. Bob Toomb's disabilities have never been removed. Women have been admitted to the Bar in eight States. (HEN.

Hendricks says lie will not have the Yice-rrcsidency on any ticket. JfR. Darwin, it is said will publish the life of his grand-father this year. The Washington Capital gives the so-called Grant boom uushirted fury. Citizen Bobinoersoll is what Don Piatt calls the Colonel. The bulls and bears of Wall street are growling and snarling. Miss Lotta the celebrated actress is in Memphis. Bob Toombs now has the credit of being a superannuated old imbecile. Stewart and Taylor Beattie spoke in New Orleans on the 1st inst. The returns from Lonisiana are not nil in. But it is safe to say the State is over whelmingly Democratic. It is quite natural to exclaim "Holy Moses." When a bull rushes N. O. Times. The President's Message is about ten columns long. It is too prosy for the Comet. All the Mississippi delegation an swered to the roll-call of Congress last Monday. The Yazoo Sentinel contains more read ing matter than any paper in the State. It is a good paper. "Talking Tournament," is what the New Orleans Times calls the Sen; ate committee. David G.Duncan, of New Orleans, a celebrated newspaper man, died on the first of this month. Hon. A. H. Stevens says he is not for Grant. That the report is a ground less fabrication. Citizens of Tennessee want Gov. Marks to convene a special session of the Legislature. H. Polkinghokne, is an Independ ent candidate for Alderman inNatchez. His name has one dozen letters in it. Sherman and the Western Kepub publicans differ very widely upon the financial question. Mr. Geo. K. Birchett, is announ ced in the Commercial as a candidate for State Senator. Tub Friars Point Gazettte is de lighted with ihenuxltu operandi ot the Postolllce at that place. The President's Message fills up the Vicksburg Commercial. Why will Presidents write such long messages? The Shubuta Messenger has lccn enlarged, and its hopeful Editor ex presses satisfaction at the success of his paper. "Thanks for your potitenexs, but I must decline the invitation." That is what Wade Hampton telegraphed when invited to be present at Grant's reception. Col. Gaknett Askbews declines to he roine candidate for Speaker of the nest House. He would make au excellent offi cer, and in a ntronR man. Miss Johkphixe Meeker, is said to I a siiccphs as a lecturer. She has . been offered $300 a week and traveling expenses to tell about her capture and king life among the Indians. A Special, from Crystal Springs to the Now Orleans Times, dated Nov. , states thut the body of Heury Black man, a mulatto, wim found dead on the morning of that date.

We are quite ready to gee the remnants and scraps of Radicalism left In the South mani fest an eagerness to fall down and worship him. But that men or sense and real patriotism of either party should (seriously look to him as the coming man to restore tho country and bring peace and prosperity and union, is to us oue of the most singular anom- oliea of this pregnant epoch of anoui- olies. If there is any restorative geuius In Grant he succeeded in smothering it during the eight years he held the presidency, with power almost unlim ited and a pliant Congress always ready to register his wishes. With all these powers and advantages larger than those enjoyed by any of his pre decessors, and greater than those wielded by any modern constitutional monarch his administration was a flat failure insofar as the restoration and harmony of the country are con cerned. It descended into a disgrace ful nepotism, was marked by plunder and corruption on all sides, and settled down into an embecile, demoralizing system of Grautism. Clothed with almost unbound ed authority during an era in which a truly great statesmanship would have made a mark that would have shown brightly on the pages of history, what is there iu Grant's ad ministration that his most servile wor shippers can point to with pride? What has he done but play into the hands of the narrowest, most rascally and venomous time-servers ? His ad ministration is a foul blot on the I American escutcheon. It developed the stupendous robberies of the whis ky rings, the trading post corruptions, and the tomb-stone sacrileges! It stood as a devouring night-mare upon the hopes and returning loyalty of the South. It destroyed, as far as it could, the returning sense of justice in tho North towards tho South. And what is Grant anyhow? A mere creature of fortunate circum stancesas a General immeasurably below Sherman; as a Statesman a full fledged burlesque. Tho man is nothing except what the surrounding circumstances make out of him. His conception of true statesmanship is hardly equal to the average cross roads politician. Intensely selfish, coarse and brutal in his instincts, too lazy to work, too ignorant to think, it is nat ural for him to fall a prey to and aud to be led by designing and cor rupt men. The straits of the Republican party may drive them again to urant, out, we do not believe that even that de structive party is ready to break rudely over the traditions oi me tamers, anu menace the country with the perils of a third term and imperialism. And for patriots, and especially Southern patriots, to to talk about accepting Grant for President, indicates nothing but a despair for the Republic, and a reckless desire to hasten its destruction. But Grant will hardly be nominated by any party. He would be a goose to accept the nomination if tendered to him ; for of all. the men in the Re publican ranks, he would be the easiest to beat. There is a species of unsound sentimentality that would canonize him as the embodiment of the late war. There is a decayed veneration which would keep the spirit of the war alive in him. But the American people the true, thinking, patriotic American people think more of the country than they do of Grant, and they are heartily tired of Grantism. This great Republic is too big for any one man, ana let any man uuueriaKe to belittle it by pluming himself as necessary to it, or to attempt to foist himself upon it and change the genius of the Government,and he will quickly see how sternly and effectually the American people will rebuke the presumption. A restoration of Grantism means the abandonment of Republicanism, and the inauguration of Imperialism The country is not ready for this, and Gen. Grant may be the President of a Canal Company, but our President he THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAOB The annual message of President Hayes Is a long, but fairly written document. None of the King's Eng lish is murdered by It. "But it con tains nothing startling. He takes oc casion to congratulate Congress upon the resumption of specie payment, tho accomplishment of the funding scheme aud speaks of the era of prosperity which dates from the first of these events. Attention is called to the re. ports and ronews of some of the sufrircstions of tho heads of the several departments, and in this connection he speaks of the arrears of the business of the Supremo Court, and recommends tho creation of ten additional Circuit Judges Oue of the points of the message is the President's deter mination to enforce the Federal laws which prohibit polygamy. Our boinS at peace with all foreign nations is alluded to, and a large portion of the message is consumed iu commenting upon the silver service. He reoommonds the passage of a law that will give the Indians a title iu foe to such lands as may full to them by lot; and suggests the establishment of a department of agriculture; and for a territorial gov ernment in Alaska, He also commends the interests of the Dissrict of Colum bia, particularly its educational needs, to the careful attention of Congress. There are other and minor sugguestious, but they are not of interest to the gen eral render. Vn have had some diiliculty hereto fore in fixing the responsibility for the late war. We had an idea that Davis, and Lincoln and Beauregard and Maj. Andeison, South Carolina and some other States North and South, had some hand in brincine on the clash of arms. But all our views were false. The problem has been explained, and the true cause of the war discovered by the Greenville Local and Advertiser. In its issue of Nov. 27th this paper says: "Only for E. Barksdale and W P. Harris the war would have been an Impossibility." We are glad to find out the truth about it at last, but the distinguished gentlemen who are sad dled with the responsibility for the war will, doubtless, be as much surprised as we were to learn the fact.
