Page fait ALBUQUERQUE MORNING JOURNAL December 7, 1921. TEXT OF MESSAGE OF DELIVERED TO 67TH COHGRES Washington, Dec. 6. The text of President Harding's message to congress in part follows: Air. Speaker and Members of Con cress; It is a very gratifying privilege to come to the congress with the republic at peace with all the na tions ot the world. More, It Is equally gratifying to report that our country is not only free from every Impending menace of war but there are growing assurances of the permanency of the peace which we so deeply cherish. It is not my purpose to bring to you a program of world restoration. In the main, such a program must be worked out by the nations most directly concerned. They must themselves turn to the heroic rem edies for the menacing conditions under which they are struggling, then we can help, and we mean to nelp. We shall do so unselfishly because there Is compensation in the consciousness of assisting, self ishly because the commerce and International exchanges In trade which marked our high tide of for tunate advancement are possible only when the nations of all con tinents am restored to stable order' and normal relationship. Mrrrhnnt Marine. The previous congress, deeply concerned on behalf of our mer chant marine, in 1920 enacted the existing shipping law, designed tor the upbuilding of the American merchant marine. Among other things wo provided to encourage our shipping on the world seas, the executive was directed to give no tlce ot the termination of all exist ing commercial treaties In order to admit of reduced duties on imports carried in American bottoms dur ing the life of the act; no executive has complied with this order of the congress. When the present ad ministration came into responsibil ity it t gan an early Inquiry into the failure to execute the expressed purpose of the Jones act. Only one conclusion has been possible. Frankly, members of house and senate, eager a I am to Join you in the making of an American mer chant marine commensurate with our commerce, the denouncement of our commercial treaties would Involve us in a chaos of trade rela tionships and add to the confusion of the already disordered commer cial world. Our power to do so Is not disputed, but power and ships. without comity of relationship, will not give us the expanded trade which Is Inseparably linked with a great merchant marine. Moreover, the applied reduction ot duty, for which the treaty de nouncements were necessary, en couraged only the carrying or dutiable imports to our shores, while the tonnage which unfurls the flag on the seas Is both free and dutiable, and the cargoes which make a nation eminent in trade are outgoing rather than in coming. It is not my thought to lay the problem In detail before you to day. It Is desired only to say to you that the executive Branch of the government, uninfluenced by the protest of any nation, for none has been made. Is well con vinced that your proposal, high ly intended and heartily support ed here, Is so fraught with diffi culties and so marked by ten dencies to discourage trade ex pansion, that I invite your toler ance of non-compliance for a very few weeks, until a plan may be presented which contemplates no greater draft upon the public treasury, and which, though yet too crude, to offer It today gives such promise of expanding our merchant marine that It will argue its own approval. It is enough to say today that we are so possessed of ships, and the American Intention to establish a merchant marine Is so unalter able, that a plan of reimburse ment, at no other cost than is contemplated In the existing act, will appeal to the pride and en courage the hope of all the Am erican people. Permanent Tariff Law. There is before you the com pleting ot the enactment of what has been termed a. "permanent" tariff law, the word "permanent" being used to distinguish It from the emergency act which the congress expedited early In the extraordinary session and which Is the law today. I cannot too strongly urge an early comple tion of this necessary legislation. It is needed to stabilize our in dustry at home; it Is essential to make more definite our trade re lations abroad. More, It Is vital to the preservation of many of our own industries, which contribute so notably to the very life blood of our nation. There Is now, and there always will be, a storm of conflicting op- (BT THE 

ASSOCIATED PRESS.) inion about any tariff revision. We can not go far wrong when we base our tariffs on the policy of preserving the productive ac tivities, whicn erhance employ ment and add to our national prosperity. World Conditions. Again comes the reminder thnt we must not be unmindful of the world conditions, thnt peoples aro struggling for industrial re habilitation and that we cannot dwell in industrial and commer clal exclusion and at the same time do the Just thing in aiding world recognition nn.l readjust ment. We do not seek a selfish aloofness, and we could not pro fit bv it. were it possible. Wo rec ognize the necessity of buying wherever we sell, and the per manence of trade lies In its ac- ceptablo exchanges. In our pur- suit of markets we most give as well as receive. Wo cannot se'.l to others who do not produco, nor can wo buy unless we pro duce at home. hciibiule ot every obligation of humanity. com merce and finance, linked as iney are in the present worm condi tion, it Is not to be argued that we need destroy ourselves to ne helpful to others. With nil my heart I wish restoration to the peoples blighted by the. awful world war, but the process of restoration does not lie in our acceptance of like conditions. It were better to remain on firm ground, strive for ample employ ment fid high standards of wages at home, and point the way to balanced budgets, rigid economy and resolute, efficient work as the necessary remedies to cure disaster. Madness in Flnnm-c. Everything relating to trade among ourselves and among na tions has been expanded, exces- nve. inflated, abnormal and tner. is a madness in finance which no American policy alone can cuie. We are a creditor nation, not by normal processes, but mane so hv war. It is not an unwortny selfishness to seek to save our selves when the processes of that salvation are not only not denied to others, but commended to them. We seek to undermine ior others no industry by which they subsist; we are obliged to per mit the, undermining ot none oi our own which make for employ ment and maintained activities. Every contemplation, it little matters which way one turns, magnifies the difficulties of tariff legislation, but the necessity of the revision is magnified with it. Doubtless we are Justified in seek ing a more flexible policy than we have provided heretofore. 1 hope a way will be found to mako for flexibility and elasticity so that rates may be adjusted to meet unusual and changing con ditions, which cannot be accurate, ly anticipated. There are prob lems Incident to unfair practices, and to exchanges which madness in money have made almost un solvable. I know of no manner in which to effect this flexibility other than the extension of the powers of the tariff commission, so that it can adapt itself to a scientiflo and wholly Just admin istration of the law. I am not unmindful of the con stitutional difficulties. These can be met by giving authority to the chief executives who could pro claim additional duties to meet conditions, which the congress may designate. At this point I must disavow any desire to enlarge the execu tive's powers or add to the respon slblUties of the office. They are already too large. If there were any other plan I would prefer it. Tariff Commission. The grant of authority to pro claim woud necessarily bring the tariff commission new and en larged activities because no execu tive could discharge such a duty except upon the Information ac quired and recommendations by this commission. But the plan le feasible and the proper function ing of the board would give us a better administration of a defined policy than ever can bo made pos sible by tariff duties prescribed without flexibility. There is a manifest difference of opinion about the American valua tion. Many ;iations have adopted delivery valuation as the basis for collecting duties; that Is, they take the cost of the imports delivered at the port of entry as the basis for levying duty, it is no radical departure, in view of the varying conditions and the disordered state of money values, to provide for American valuation, but there can not be Ignored the danger of such a valuation brought to the level ot our own production costs, making our tariffs prohibitive. It might 

BETTER TIMES IF YOU HUSTLE "Better times are coming; work will soon be more plentiful, and the wide-awake man in business will again enjoy the fruits of prosperity." That is what the students of economics tell us, and that is what men of big affairs are saying. They know because they can read the signs. We believe them. The wide-awake man! Is that you? The hustler is going to get the best of it, because it is not going to be as easy as it was two years ago. Everything came too easy then and most people were spoiled. Now we have to rustle as we did in 1916. Are you ambitious? Join the ranks of the future greats who do business at these two banks. Fifty dollars will start a checking account. State National Bank Affiliated With TKe State Trust & Savings Bank. .Combined Resources Four and One-Half Million Dollars do so In many instances where imports ought to be encouraged. I be!. eve congress ought well to .consider the desirability of only 'promising alternative, namely, a provision authorising proclaimed American valuation, under pre scribed conditions, on any given list of articles imported. In this proposed flexibility authorizing Increases to meet con ditions so likely to change, there should also be provision for de creases. A rate may be Just today, and entirely out of proportion six months from today. If our tariffs are to be made equitable, and not necessarily burden our imports and hinder our trade abroad, frequent adjustment will be necessary for years to come. Knowing the im possibility of modification by act of congress for any one or a score of lines without Involving a ions; array of schedules, I think we shall go a long ways toward stab ilization, if there is recognition of the tariff commission's fitness to recommend urgent changes by proclamation. .signs of Business Revival. I am sore about public opinion favoring the early determination of our tariff policy. There liavo been reassuring signs of a busi ness revival from the deep Blump which all the world has been ex periencing. Our unemployment, which gave us deep concern only a few weeks ago, has grown en couragingly less and new assur ances and renewed confidence will attend the congressional declara tion that American industry will be held secure. Much has been said about the protective policy for ourselves mak ing it impossible tor our debtors to discharge their obligations to us. This is a contention not ncv pressing for decision. If we must choose between a peoplo in idle ness pressing for the payment of indebtedness, or a people resum ing tho normal ways of employ ment and carrying the credit, let us choose the latter. Sometimes we appraise largest the human 111 most vivid in our minds. We havo been giving, and are giving now, our influence and appeals to minimize the likolihood ot war and throw off the crushing bur dens of armament. It is all very earnest, with a national soul Im pelling. Hut a people unemployed and gaunt with hunger, face a situation quite as disheartening as war and our greater obligation to day Is to do the government's part toward resuming productivity and promoting fortunate and remuner ative employment. American Agriculture. Something more than tariff pro tection is required by American agriculture. To the farm has come the earlier and the heavier bur dens of readjustment. There Is actual depression in our agricul ture industry, while agricultura prosperity Is absolutely essential to the general prosperity of the coun try. Congress has sought very earn estly to provide relief. It has promptly given such temporary re lief as has been possible, but tho call is Insistent for the permanent solution. It is Inevitable that large crops lower the prices and short crops advance them. No legislation can cure that funda mental law, but there must be some economic solution for the excessive variation In returns for agriculture production. It Is rather shocking to be told and to have the statement strong ly supported that 9,000,000 bales of cotton, raised on American plantations In a given year, actu ally will be worth more to the producers than 15,000,000 bales would have been. Equally shock ing is the statement that 700,000, 000 bushels of wheat, raised by Amorican farmers would bring them more money than a billion bushels, yet these are not exag gerated statements. In a world where there are tens of millions who need food and clothing, which they can not get, such a condition is sure to Indict the social sys tem which makes it possible, Cooperating Communities. In the main the remedy lies in distribution and marketing. Every proper encouragement should bs given to the cooperative marketing programs. These havo proven very helpful to the cooperating communities In Europe. In Rus sia the cooperative community has become a recognized bulwark of law and order, and saved Individ ualism from engulfment In social paralysis. Ultimately they will be accredited with the salvation of the Kussian state. There is the appeal for this ex periment. Why not try It? None challenges the right of the farmer to a larger share of the consumers' pay for his product, no ono can dispute that we can not live with out the farmer. He is Justified in rebelling against the transpor tation cost. Given a fair return for his labor he will have less oc casion to appeal for financial aid, and given assurance that his labors shall not be in vain, we assure all the people of a production suf ficient to meet our national re quirement and guard against disaster. Movement to Cities. The base ot the pyramid of civilization which rests upon the soil is shrinking through the drift of population from farm to city. ! or a generation we have been j expressing more or less concern i about this tendency. Economic ! have warned and statesmen have deplored. We thought for a time that modern conveniences and I the more intimate contact would halt the movement, but It has gone steadily on. Perhaps only ; grim necessity will correct It, but j we ought to find a less drastic ! remedy. j The existing scheme of ad Justing freight rates has been favoring the basing points, until inaustnes are attracted to some centers and repelled from others. A great volume of uneconomic and wasteful transportation has at tended and the cost Increased ac cordingly. The grain milling and meat packing industries afford ample Illustration, and the attend ing concentration Is readily ap parent. The menaces In concen tration are not limited to the re tarding influences on agriculture, Manifestly the conditions and terms of railway transDortatinn ought not be permitted to increase the undesirable tendency. We nave a Just pride In our great cities, but we shall find a greater pride In the nation, which has a larger distribution of its popula tlon into the country, where com paratively self-sufficient smaller communities may blend agricul tural and manufacturing interests in harmonious helpfulness and en hanced good fortune. Such a movement contemplates no des truction of things wrought, of in vestments made, or wealth in volved. It only looks to a general policy of transportation of dis tributed industry and of highway construction, to encourage the spread of our population and restore the proper balance be tween city 'and country. The problem may well have your earnest attention; It has been perhaps the proud tlon that in dealing with human reiationsmps It has constantly movea lowara sucn Justice in dis tributing tho product of human energy that it has improved con tinuously the economical status of the mass of people. Ours has been a highly productive social organization. On the way up from the olementa! stages of society we have eliminated slavery and serf dom, and are now far on the way to the elimination of poverty. I Diffusion of Education. 'Through the eradication of illiteracy, and the diffusion of edu cation, mankind has reached a wiiurp we may ralrly say that in the United States equality "i opportunity nas been attained uiougn an are not prepared to emDrace it. Thore is indeed, a 100 great divergence between the oconomlo conditions of the most and the least favored classes in the community. But even that divergence has now come to the point where we bracket tho very poor and the very rich together as the least fortunate classes. Our efforts may well be directed to improving the status of both. While this set of problems is commonly comprehended under the general phrase "capital and labor," it is really Justly broader. It is a question of social and economic or ganization. Labor has become a largo contributor, through its sav ings, to tho stock of capital; while the people who own the largest in- mviuuai aggregate of capital, are themsolves often hard and earnest laborers. Very often it is extreme ly difficult to draw the line of de marcation between the two groups; to determine whether an individual is entitled to bo set down as labor or as capitalist. In a very large proportion of cases he is both and when he Is both he is the most useful citizen. Right to Organize. The right of labor to organize Is Just as fundamental and necessary as is the right of capital to organ ize. The right of labor to negoti ate, to deal with and solve its par ticular problems, In an organized way, through Its chosen agents, is Just ns essential as Is tho right of capital to organize, to maintain corporations, to limit the liabilities of stockholders. Indeed we have come to realize that the limited liability of the citizens ns a mem ber of a labor organization closely parallels the limitation of liability of the citizen as a stockholder in a corporation for profit. Along this lino of reasoning we shall make the greatest progress towards solution of our problems of capital and labor. In the case of the corporation which enjoys the privilege ot limit ed aliblty of stockholders, particu larly when engaged in tho public service it is recognized that the outside puWie has a lare concern which must be protected; and so we provide regulations, restrictions and in some cases detailed supervi sion. Likewise in the case ot labor organization, we might well apply similar and equally well defined principles of regulation and super vision in order to conserve tho pub lic's Interest as affected by their operations. Just as it is not desirable that a j corporation shall be allowed to im pose undue exactions upon the pub lic, so It Is not desirable that a labor organization shall be per mitted to exact unfair terms of employment or subject the public to actual depresses in order to in force its terms. Finally Just as we are earnestly seeking for pro cedures whereby to adjust and set tle political differences between na tions without resort to war, so we mav well look about for means to settle the differences between or ganized capital and organized labor without resort to those forms of warfare which wo recognize under the names of strikes, lockouts, boy cotts and the like. As we have creat bodies of law carefully regulating the organlza. tlon nnd operations of industrial and financial corporations, as we have treaties and compacts among nations which look to tho settle ment of differences witnout tne necessity of conflict in arms, so we might well have plans of confer ence, of common counsel, of medi ation, arbitration and Judicial de termination in controversies oe- tween labor and capital. To accom plish this would involve the neces sity to develop a thorough-going code of practice in dealing with such affairs. It might be well to frankly set forth the superior in terest of the community as a whole to either the labor group or tne capital group. With rights, privi leges, Immunities and modes of or ganizations thus carefully defined, it should be impossible to set up Judicial or quasi-Judicial tribunals for the consideration and determi nation of all disputes which men ace the public welfare. (Strikes and Lockouts, In an industrial society such as ours the strike, the lockout and the bovcott are as much out of place and as disastrous in their results as is war or armed revolution in the domain ot politics. The same disposition to reasonableness, to conciliation, to recognition of the other side's point of view, the same provision of fair and recognized tribunals and processes, ought to make it possible to eolve the one set of questions as easy as the other. I believe solution is possible. The consideration of such a policy would necessitate the exer cise of care, of deliberation In the construction of a code and a char ter of elemental rights, dealing with the relations of employer and employe. This foundation In the law. dealing with the modern con ditions of social and economic life would hasten the building of the temple of peace In industry which a rejoicing nation would acclaim. After each war, until the last, the government has been enabled to give homes to Us returned soldiers and a large part of our settlement and development has attended this generous provision of land for the nation's defenders. FubUo Domain. There Is yet unreserved approxi mately 200,000,000 acres in tho public domain, 20,000,000 acres of which are known to be suceptible of reclamation and made fit for homes by provision for Irrigation. The government has been assist ing in the development of Its re maining lands, until tne esumaii.ii increase In land values in the irri gated sections is fully $500,000,000, and the crops of 1920 alone on these lands are estimated to ex ceed $100,000,000. Under the law authorizing these expenditures for development, the advances are to be returned end it would be good business for the government to provide for the re clamation of the remaining 20, 000,000 acres, in addition to ex pediting the completion of projects long under way. Under what is known as the coal and gas lease law, applicable also to deposits of phosphates and other minerals on the public domain, leases are now being made on the royalty basis, and are producing large revenues to the government. Under this legislation, 10 per centum of all royalties Is to be paid airectiy to tne reaeral treasury and of the remainder 60 per centum is est claim of our American civlllza. to be used for reclamation of arid lands by Irrigation and 40 per centum is to be paid to the states in which the operations are located, to be used by them for school and road purposes. These resources are so vast and the development is affording so re liable a basis of estimate that the interior department expresses the belief that ultimately the present law will add In royalties and pay ments to the treasurers of the federal government and the ttnie containing these public lands o otal of $12,000,000,000. This means, of course, an added wealth of many times that sum. These pros pects seem to afford every Justifi cation of government advices in reclamation and irrigation. Reclaiming Lands, Contemplating tho inequitabla and desirable Increase of popula tion, there is another phaso of re clamation full worthy of considera tion. There are 70,000,000 acres of swamp and cutover lands whlcn may be reclaimed and made as valuable as any farm lands we pos sess. These acres are largely lo cuted in southern states, and tho greater proportion Is ownoi by tho states or by private citizen). Con gress has a report of the survey of this field for reclamation, and the feasibility is established. I gladly commend federal aid by way of advances where state in! private participation is assured. Home making is one of tne greater benefits which government cun bestow. Measures are pending embodying these sound policies to which wo may well adhere. It is easily possible to make available permanent homes which will pro vide in turn, for prosperous Amer ican families without injurious competition with established activ ities, or imposition on wealth al ready acquired. While we aro thinking of pro moting the fortunes of our own people, I am sure there Is room In the sympathetic thought of America for fellow human, beings who (ire suffering and dying of starvation in Russia. -A severe drought In the valley of the Volga has plunged 15,000,000 people into ' grievous famine. Our voluntary agencies are exerting themselves to the utmost to save the lives of children in this area, but it is now evident that unless relief Is af forded the loss of life will extend Into many millions. America can not be deaf to such a call as that Call of the Dying. We do not recognize the govern ment of Russia nor tolerate tho propaganda which emanates there from, but we do not forget the tra-j ditlons of Russian friendship. We' may put aside our consideration of all International politics and fundamental differences in govern ment. The big thing is the call of the suffering and the dying. Unreservedly I recommend the ap propriation necessary to supply the American relief administration change with 10,000,000 bushels of corn billions and 1,000,000 bushels of seed grains, not alone to halt tho wave of death through starvation, but to enable spring planting In areas wnere tne seed grains have been exhausted temporarily to stem starvation. The American relief admlnistra' tlon Is directed In Russia by for mer officers of our own armies and has fully demonstrated Its ability to transport and distribute relief through American hands without hinderance or loss. The time has come to add the govern ment Bupport to the wonderful re lief already wrought out of the generosity of the American prl vato purse. I am not unaware that we have suffering and privation at homa. When it extends the capacity for the relief within the slates con cerned, it will have federal con sideration. It seems to me we should be indifferent to our own heart promptings, and out of ac cord with the spirit which acclaims the Christmas tide, if we do not give out of our national abundance to lighten this burden of woe upon a people blameless and helpless In famine's peril. Amending Organic Law. There are a full score of topics concerning which it would be be-1 might develop Into causes of in coming to address you, and on which I hope to make report at a later time. I have alluded to the things requiring your earlier attention. However, I cannot end this limited address without a sug gested amendment to the organic law. Many of us belong to that school of thought which is hesitant about altering the fundamental law. I think our tax problems, the tend ency of wealth to seek non-taxable investment, and tne menacing in crease of public debt, federal state and municipal all Justifies a proposal to change the consti tution so as to end the Issue of non-taxable bonds. No action can the status of the many outstanding, but we can guard against future encourage ment of capita) paralysis, ivhl'.o a halt in the growth of public in debtedness would be bencflca! throughout our whole land. Such a change In the constitution must bo very thoroughly considered be fore submission. There ought to be known what influence it will have on the inevitable refunding of our vast national debt, how it will operate on the necessary re funding of state and municipal debts, how the advantages of na tion over state and municipal or the contrary, may be avoided. Clearly the states would not ratify to their own apparent disadvant age. I suggest the consideration because the drift of wealth Into non-taxable securities is hindering the flow of large capital to our Industries, manufacturing, agri cultural and carrying, until we are discouraging the very activities which make our wealth. Agreeable to your expressed desire and in complete accord with the purposes of legislative branch of the government, there Is in Washington as you happily know. an international conference now most earnestly at work on plans for the limitation of armaments, naval holiday and the Just settlement of problems which ternational disagreement. It is easy to believe a world hope is centered on this capital city. A most gratifying world accomplishment is not improbable. 

MAJOR LEAGUE CHIEFS MEETINCMN BUFFALO Buffalo, N. Y Dec. 6. Scouts for the major leagues, hovering about the side lines as the 26 minor leagues got down to busi ness today, apparently found the picking and choosing of new ma terial very poor. A day of dicker ing and rumors brought no defi nite announcement of the acquisi tion of a single player either by purchase from the minors or trades among the major leagues. Tne opening session of the min ors was late In convening and ad journment was tanen until tomor row after President M. T. Sexton delivered his annual address and Secretary J. H. Farrell submitted his report. Hie secretary s report showed that all of the 26 minor leagues launched last spring completed their respective seasons. Twenty- eight league organizations quali fied for membership in 1921 and only two rauea to get a start. These were the Kentucky State league and the lnter-Provlncial league. Richard Barthelmess will prob ably be the next eastern star to go to California to make his pictures. Alice camoun. vitagraph luminary has Just arrived in Los Angeles to work there permanently.
