Small-Boat Landing at tub Batteey. ? T ie necessity for the prompt construction of a suitable iaudiag for small boats at the Battery is becoming evory day more and more appa rent. During tb* last week or two a number p.* tiuf own national reusels, as well as a<'.reral lorjigr: men-of-war, have been anchored off (he Batieff. and the uGlscrs and others have b:en obliged to go out of the way, and at tr.ftob inconvenience, nit to say danger, etfcot a lauding at the lickcty oid steps in the rear of tho tumblo-dowa iS^rge OfEce.

The two Houses of the Vorty-llrst Congress reassemble iu the national Capitol to-day. The Congress with the session oxpircs oa the 4th of March next, whon the new or Forty ?ooond Congress, unless meantime otherwise ordered by law, will immediately take its place. A quorum in each branch will doubtless be present to-day at nooij, tb<? hour of meeting, with Speaker I'laino in the chair of the House, and Vice President Colfax in the Senate. A joint committee will then be appointed to wait upoa the President to inform him that the two houses are iu session and are ready to receive any communication he may have to make. Th? President then, we expect, will at once, by his confidential sacretary, send up to the two houses his annual Message, with the usual accompanying reports from the several executive departments. With the readiug of the Message in Congress the tele graph will scatter it broadcast over the coun try, so that before sunset it will probably be as well understood in New York, Bangor, New Orleans and San Francisco as in Washington. We expect nothing very starring in this Message. General Grant, abounding in start ling effects during the war, has, since the picturesque winding up at Appomattox Court House, bean the very embodiment or peace. Ik- will give us a gratifying exhibit of the prac tical results of bis administrative policy of economy, retrenchment, reform and the re demption of the national debt ; he will show how with Sherman, Sheridan and the army on the one band, and tlie Quaker peace commis sioners and agonts on the other, Red Cloud und Spotted Tail have been induced to abandon the war path; how the revenue hus b.-en increased from the reduced tax on whiskey ; how marvellous are the prosperity and devel opment of the new States aud Territories of the West; how quietly under the fifteenth amendment negro suffrage has been estab lished; how peaceably the new election laws of Congress, with the consent of Tammany Hall, w^re enforcod in the Now York city election; how friendly are the relations sub siding between the United States and "all the world and the rest of mankind," and how small is our national debt compared with our u mazing national resources. We expect all this and much more i* tho same vein in the Message. Nor do ire think tli at it will overlook our shipping interest, or the importance of the acquisition of the island of St. Domingo, or the co l fisheries of New foundland or the seal fisheries of Alaska. But wo have no conception of what the President will propose or say in reference to free trade, Cuba, Mexico er those aforesaid Alabama claim.). Wo shall, perhaps, bj informed that our commercial relations with Cuba are still disturbed by the intestine disorders of the island, and that negotiations on the Alabama claims will probably be resumod after tho restoration of peace in France or after the adjournment of the European conference which is soon to m-?ot in London to rectify the status of U issia is the Black Sea. Bjarin; in mind that "Let us have peace" is the motto of General Grant, and that ''Slow and eura" is the legond of Mr. Fish, we anlicipate a Mes sage on our foreign affairs which the wurliko General B,>n Butler, we are afraid, will pro nounce broad-brimmed, shad-bellied, slip shod and fl it, but which will bo well adapted | to the programme of economy, retrenchment, reduction of taxes and redemption of the debt. What, then, will Congress do ? Very little in the way of legislation this short suasion, we apprehend, beyond the regular appropriation bills. There is a heavy budget of uifinishod business on hand romaining orer from tho last session, including big railway jobs and small private claims, internal tax bills, tariff bills, postal telegraph bills and a great variety of other bills ; but, from present appearances, tho month of December will be occupied in discussing the late elections, General Grant and his chanccs, Tammany Hall, Fcnton and Tom Murphy, Sumner and Motley, Fish and Cuba, Gratz Brown, Carl Schurz and the Mis souri rumpus, the Alabama gubernatorial muddle and the free trade or revenue reform conspiracy for the upper hand in the next Con gress. Tho "everlasting nigger" is exhausted in the fifteenth amendment, and the coast is clear for a free and full discussion of anything and everything under the Sim. The late elec tions, General Grant und the money question, however, will first have to be ventiluted, though we suspect that in the interval to Christmas Gen?-ral Butler will m tke a power ful sortie with Yankee fishermen's rights against Canada and those Anglo-rebel Ala bama spoliations. Nor do we despair of a tremendous effort by Mr. Julian, of Indiana, to bring into the foreground the sixteenth amendment, for woman suffrage. Inspired by the re-elcction of Governor Hoffman and the defeat of General Schonck, Mr. Brook?, Mr. Cox aud Mr. Wood may bring up in the House the question of federal bayonets in our political elections and the tax on salt; but if Cox, Wood and Brooks move in these matters we expect that Joha Mor risscy and John Fox, before their retirement, will givu a counterblast that will exhilarate the Young Democracy. Surely Morrissey and Fox ought to do something to leave as their mark in Congress before they retire, and their time is short. It is supposed, however, that one of tho most exciting debates of this session will be npon a bill to postpone the first meet ing of the next Congress until the first Mon day in December next. Under Andy John son's lively administration, when the Fortieth Congress was elected the conflict between him and Congress for the reconstruction of the rebel States was at white heat. As the law then stood there would be the long interval from the 4th of March to the first Monday in December between tho outgoing and the incasing Congress, aud if left to himself rt was feared that Johnson, by what ho called "my policy," might, in that long interval of nine months, Johnsonize the whole South or get up another rebellion. So, to head off Johnson, the two honses passed the law, and passed it over bis head, requiring the new Congress to meet on the 4th of March, immediately after tho ad journment of the "outgoing Congress. TIiub Johnson was completely flankod and defeated in his policy of reconstruction, and thus the new law worked to a charm. Now this law snoms to be in the way of , republican harmoar. It is known that there ia a scheme on foot for the election of !he Speaker of the next House by a coalition of all tbo free traders or roveauo reformers, demo crats and republicans ; and it it* feared that if the new Congress be permitted to come to gether on the It h of March thin coalition may be successful in the election of the Speaker. It is supposed, on the o'her hund, that with the repeal of this law, which will postpone tho meeting of the new Congress till Docember next (unless specially called by the President), this free trade coalition may be broken up or def-ated. Hence the idea of a repeal, and as the anti-free trader* in the present Congress have the power they may change the law. But the bill, if introduced, will not pass with out a lively debate, develop! :g all the ina and ou b of the political parties, cliques and fac tions of the day. First of all, however, we await the meeting of the two houses and the President's message. General Grant has a fine opportunity in this message for the consolidation of the republi can party; but we apprehend that in the exccss of his caution upon tbo great questions of the day he will fail in this message to make any decisivo impression upon Congress or the country. Papal NpoHnfloii? I*roto?t? of KukIIhIi H)>L-nltliic Catbollra. Such a spectacle as was witnessed yester day in this city and Philadelphia was alto gether unprecedented in the history of the republic ; and although the action of tho London Catholics at the same time was rot without precedent, it was performed with a I measure of vigor and boldness unknown ! to Catholicism in England since the great struggle between opposing reli gious ideas ended with the triumph of the Protestants in the British Islands. Yesterday was, in fine, rendered memorable by the pro tests then offered, by English-speaking Catho lics, against the forcible seizure of the Pope's temporal domains by the government of King Victor Emmanuel. For close reasoning and hard logic the protest of the Archbishop of Westmiisier is remarkable. We have heard the justification of the Italian authorities for tho Boizuro of Rome, and we now hear it at tacked by Catholics. Undeniably the ques tion ia a grave one, containing problems insol uble to the ordinary intelligence, but the solu tion of which is as much a necessity to the Catholic world as it is to the social and politi cal future of Italy. The Archbishop of West minster argues with great force against what he terms the "sacrilegious" spoliation of the Papacy. He reviews the question from all points of view, religious, social and political, and his conclusions are naturally against the act of King Victor Emmanuel. If his argument is even not incontestible, it is at least entitled to respectful and thoughtful consideration as embodying the views of thoso who adhere to the doctrine that the temporal depondenco of the Pope is inconsistent with his office of Vice regent of God on Earth. But the protest of tho English Archbishop was, perhaps, of lfss significance than the protests of the Catholics of New York and Philadelphia, because in these citios they came from the laity almost without interme diate agency. Every Catholic church in this city wa3 densely thronged to listen to and to approve the address to tho Pope, prepared, it is said, by Mr. Charles O'Conor, himself an eminent American Catholic, protesting against the seizure of Rome. It is noteworthy that at one church ? St. Joseph's ? the pastor, Rev. Father Farrell, was the only person who objected to any part of the pro test, and although bis objections were merely to the wording, and were of much force, they were voted down by his congregation with marked unanimity. In Philadelphia the movement was not bo general ; nevertheless thirty thousaud Catholics assembled in and arouad the Cathedral and protested against the "Italian usurpation." Whatever be the effect of these protests, their moral and religious significance cannot be denied and should not be underrated. We have no apprehensions that American Catholics will ever bo called upon to aid,, by force of arms, to replaee Pius the Ninth on the Papal throne, nor are we at all aauguine that they would respond to any such call if it were made. Our age is too civilized for such a thing as a religious war. But there is a moral fact in the protests which is unmistakable. It is that the Catho lics of the United States and of England en tertain the liveliest affection and veneration for the Pope ; that they balieve that the cause of the Christian religion imperatively demands that the head of their Church be temporally independent of all earthly lulers. The alacrity with which they responded to the summons to protest and tho unanimity with which they protested demon strate the unity of their minds on this, the most profound, exeitiag and important religious topic of the day. And we may say, without offering any opinion as to their merits or demerits, that the protests, made as they were, prove that the materialism of the age has not usurped the piaee of tho religious sentiment of human ity to as great an extent as is popularly sup posed. Secretary Robeson's Report. ? We pub lish this morning the annual report of the Sec retary of the Navy, showing the condition of the naval department of the government and making suggestions for its improvement. As will be seen the expenditures have decreased, but this has admittedly been at the expense of our position as one of the great naval Powers of the Earth. Secretary Robeson, without making any complaint, shows how inadequate our squadrons are to perform the duties ex pected of thorn, and compares their weakness, in point of the numbar of vessels composing them, with the strength of English and French squadrons. The report embruces numurous other Matters imyqflfrqca. ftU of are succinctly stated and will bo perused with interest. Ths Cabinet and Oik Navy m this Black Ska. ? It will be seen by a special Washington despatch elsewhere that the ques tion of the right of our war vessels to pan* through the Dardanelles has been officially discussed in the Cabinet. The result of the discussion, we are informs^, was a resolve that our government would aot make that demand just at this time, as we were net in a position to go to war upon that issue. Cool aqd cautious; The War Hii nation la France. Th^rc Is little in the news pebjishod this morning which would lead to the iri&renoo that any marked alteration has taken plac^in tho situation of the French or German armies^ from what it was two days ago. The news of the severity of tlif fight of Friday is confirmed by telegrams this morning. The Saxon troops suffered terribly in the assault made on tho French lines, while attempting to recover their lost positions on tho east bank of the Marne. The conflict must have b.'en moat fierce. Tho tempo rary gain of the French resulted from tho adoption of the tactics employed by the Ger mans throughout this whole war ? that of being ready with reinforcements at the prvper time and having thorn on tho gtound whun wanted. From the report ?f the Prince of Saxony we find that Brie and Cbampigny urc again in possession of the Germaus. Thus it would appear that most of the lest ground has been regained, and that bo fur as the French are concerned their victories were but ne ;a tive successes, which were now wholly neutral ized. There is, however, one point gained by the late sorties. It is this : tho forces within Paris are capuble of accomplishing somatbing worthy of the traditional fame of French arms. The question is, will they accomplish it ? If the report that, the soldiers who were wounded in tho recent sorties, and who fell prisoners to tho Germans, requested not to be sent back to Paris be true, it is, to say tho least of it, a bad indication. Wouuded soldiers, as a rule, prefer to be in the care of their own army, rather than in that of their captoru. We have tho rumor that the German officers ara becoming downhearted, and lack the energy which they exhibited at the com mencement of the campaign. This is but natural, and no doubt the general desire among the rank and file of tho German armies now in France is for the war to end. With the fall of Paris the Fronch cause will bo lost, and the capitulation of Paris depends on the supplies within tho city. So long as the people and the army can bo fed bo long, wo think, will Puris hold out. It is purely a question of supplies, and those in control in the city will make them go as far as possible. It was ho at Strasbourg and at Mots, and will bo so at Paris. The Army of the Loire has made no advance within tho past few days, and is not likely to do so for some days to come. In other words, it has keen checked. Reinforcements from the South uro passing through en route to join it. The Germans hold their old positions at Pilhiviern, Artenay and Augurville, with Prince Frederick Charles at their head. This is tho situation as we regard it from the despatches published ilus morning. The liritUb Nary. Thi3 is a time when the fierce light of pub licity beats dowa upon all things and shows tbem us they arc with pitiless exactitude. Nothing escapes. We all live now with the privilege of going behind tho scenes aud seeing how emperors and ?impresses, as well as cob blers, "make up'* for the part they have to play on the stage. The ciphered despatches rec?ived by a crownod conspirator against humanity are soon made public property by thunder strokes of calamity that search him out through the walls of his palace and the ranks of his guards. Nobody, nothing, can escape this dread ordeal. And it is well that it should bo ho. Truth has lived too long at the bottom of a well. It is high time she came a little nearer the surface. Tho latest sham to be exploded is the British navy, conventionally supposed to be all powerful, but in reality, as iB well known to those who have followed the ignoble story of British naval maladministration, a quite untrustworthy instrument of power in point of fact. This exposure has been made with crushing effect by that brilliant sailor Captain Sberard Osborn, who has spent years of energetic, but fruitless, attack upon the Board of Admiralty at Whitehall ? an office which has been for a century standing before the world wearing a fool's cap and bells as complacently as though they were a laurelled crown and a sceptre. In a letter to tho London Times of November in Captain Osborn states facts which are humiliating and 6hameful to England, and, in view of possible complica tions, ought, just now, to be really alarming. First, it appears, incredible as it may seem, that this precious Board was in possession of tho most complete analysis, mathematically certain In its terms, that the ill-fated Captain, which went down like a stone a little whiie ago, drowning ail her crcw, was quite unfit to cope with a gale of wiud under canvas. This thoroughly reasoned Hlateme.it contrasts tho sailing qualities ia heavy weather of the Monarch and the Captain, and umounts to a plain warning that the latter unfortunate ves sel was absolutely unfitted to sail ia company with tho first; in fact, amounted to a elear prophecy that if she attempted to do under canvas what the Monarch could easily do there would bo a tremendous catastrophe. This warning was not ccmmunicatod to the commander of the Captain, and, accordingly, he and his ship's company perished, slain vir tually by the criminal negligence of the British Admiralty. But Captain Onborn'a letter contains far more serious matter. He charges upon the whole British fleet of iron-clads that the un equal thickness of their armor plating, their full rig and their high freeboard, or side com bined make them qaito unfit to keep the seas in heavy weather, and expose them to certain destruction at the hands of foreign artillerists, who knew, in fact, far more about them than British naval officers. The Captain quotes from a letter to himself of one of the ablest of Britisn naval officers tbo startling statement, "I do IfelUjTS we have to-d?y six vas peld that ccuM keep the sea and sail together iu a very ordinary winter's gale." So much for their seaworthiness and power to sail to gether as consorts and a fleet. But what of their armor plating? T.'ie Captain is even more decisive on this head, ana states facts which throw light upon the powerlessness of the French navy in this war, as well as upon the certain helplessness of the existing British navy in any war. The high freeboard, or side, of the British ships ? and the- French are similarly built ? has rendered it necessary to cover them with plating of unequal thickness ; Qtlwrwiae they would uot be capable qf coins: to sea at all, from sheer dead weight. Therofprd they hare soft plaOes and hard places. Parts of their sides are re all/ protected by adequate iron plates against the powerful rifled ordnance of land batteries and small uhips of the Monitor if ^e. But all the rust is as vulnerable as paper to the tremendous guns which every Power poss-Bses^ The result being that such ships are worth, as Captain Osborn pronounces thorn with bitter sarcasm, the French vessels just the value of old iron j the Euglijh ships a j small percentage, perhapn, moro. But more, and here comes a strikimr illuv tration of tho marvellous prescience of Prus sian military administration. Captain Osborn | vouches for it, on his own personal knowledge, j that every Prussian officer in charge of a gun ' on a Prussian ship is furnished with diagrams ? showing precisely the condition of the side* of every French iron-clad, where its weak part* are and where its strong, so thai it would be certain destruction to the French fleet to ex pose itself to the Are of the Prussian batteries ' and smaller vessels, at which the Frenoh naval officers have, therefore, been obliged to con tent themselves with gassing ingloriously un>l to no purpose. This is not only so with the French vessel#, but, the Captain alleges, also en his persoual knowledge, that tho Prussian-* are furnished a3 well with diagrams of the sides of the British vessels, telling the story of their condition with t so most scientific accu racy and precision. So tb&l in point of fact j the uphhoi of this remarkable critioism and dis closure is thai EngUud is practically without | a nary at this most momentous crisis of Euro pean affairs. Could anything more effectually point tho moral of what we have elsewhere said con cerning the duty of England just now to hold her own peace and not break the world's peace ? And what has come, let us ask, to tho first naval power of the world that In spito of ten years' trials and warnings she cannot get a fleet in which ber leading naval officers can feel any confidence ? Tho disorganization and imbecility that prevail in British politics and administration are positively startling to impartial observers. How will they end? Certainly in soma deserved catastrophe, if she persists in spending upon impertinent attempts to set other people at right abroad, auy of tke energy which is all required for settling her much disordered house at homo. Church Hrrmont Yeaterdar. Yesterday nearly all tlic churches were well filled, sinners and saints agreeing to take advantago of the fine weather to display their costumes and their piety. As is usual, It v. Mr. llepworth preached before a fashionable congregation, upon whom ho impressed the good policy, and even necessity, of entering into closer relationship with God than they had yet done. Rev. Mr. Smyth, at the American Free church, lectured on the European war, reminded his hearers of the verification of tho prophecy which he had uttered at its incep tion, and proceeded to predict the extermina tion of Mohammedanism .as the ultimate result of the renewed agitation of the Eastern ques tion. Upon Dr. Chapin devolved the task of pointing out the duty of to-day and the attain ment of a true life. Rev. J. M. Pullman demon strated ih it the God of philosophy was by no means tho God of Christianity, in which he was doubtless, in a measure, correct. Father Aubrlel, at the Church of St. Vincent de Paul, urged the necessity of prayer and meditation, while, at the close of the annual "retreat" at St. Francfs Xavler's, Father Bapts delivered a short and interesting address. The dedication of a new Catholic church at Kingsbrid^e was also the occasion for an instructive sermon delivered by Arahhishop McClo3key. Returning to the Protestant places o'' wor ship we find that tho Rev. W. S. Mikebi, at the Nineteenth stroet Baptist church, dis coursed on the happiness and value of Chris tianity, which sonn members of his congra gation seemed to find in flirtation and loud talking, much td the scandal of religion. In Brooklyn Apostle Beecher did not attract his accustomed large congregation, the reason for which is stated to be the absence of those jokes and iheir consequent hilarity which have made the tabernacle famous. But Brother Beech er has, temporarily at least, abandoned the merry jest and confined himself to the elucidatioa of solemn truths solemnly spoken. There was certainly nothing to laugh about in the subject of salvation, which was discoursed upon yesterday understanding ly and acceptably. At St. -lames' Catholic Cathe dral also, in Brooklyn, P?i?hop Loughlin preached on the subject of scandal, the enor mity of which and its meretricious effects ho eloquently described. In Washington Dr. Newman administered a sharp rebuke to politicians and slanderers, arguing that the las!, in many instances, proceeded from tha first. Even iu Jersey City evil doing and acting was rebuked, and at the Third Presbyterian church Dr. JIar R tenj smote a deadly sin in the shape of "a large lump of tobacco" in a godless chewer's month. Such, in brief, wero the religious topics of yesterday. We commend to the public a caro ful perusal of the sermons published in the Herald this morning, believing that from them there may bo derived much spiritual aad moral consolation. .Ilywtcrluu* Death*. Mysterious deaths in different parts of the city have become very frequent of late. There waB the case of Mr. Doughty, who was arrested for noisy conduct in the street and sent to the hospital on Black well's Island, where he died. There were marks of blood upon bim when arrested, yet nobody appears to havo taken tho trouble to discover whether the man was hurt.

His Grace, Archbishop Manning, of Went minster, England, speaks to the Christian world in defence of the lay sovereignty and the integrity and authority of the Holy See I an episcopal protest directed against th occupation of Rome by King Victor Emmanuel, bin rule in the Eternal City and the means of its accomplishment. Thij powerful manifesto was read in all the Cathofi churches of London and the suburbnij parishes yesterday. We huvtj had specially telegraphed, verbatim, through the Atlantis cable and present it the transatlantic peoples in the columns o| the Herald to-day. The issue of this pape: will produce a great cffect in Europe. Th^ Archbishop makes the call on the surround ing crowns to revolve around the centre ol unity in Rome ; he founds the claim of divintj right as the exemplar of law and the guar dian of society on the words of the inspired volume, and then places the sacred word for exposition and the transmission of its precepts in the hand* of the Sovereign Pontiff. In this view of th? case the production of this Church paper becomes of vast importance, particularly on the eve of the assembling of a European lay Congrea3 in London, near to the tomb of Wolsey, and not far distant from the shrine of Thomas h Be eke t and the footprints of St. Augustia. Wo shall learn of its consequences at an early day after its first principles have been discussed by the sovereign delegates to the Congress. A European Congretm, Pop* Pin* Pre liMnf. Our despatches from the Cabinets of the Old World, coining in simultaneously with those which emanate from the military camps and headquarters of that d:sordered and ui bapny region of the Earth, disclose son*! sense of returning, if it be but tardy, reason The wand of Gortchakoff has summoned u the spirit of compromise from the vasty deep of monarchical contentions, and all the Powers cosignatory to the Treaty of Paris, along with othors who stood outside of that Convention, manifest a willingness to meet by delegate at London, there to rearrange tbo map of Europe in a sense consistent with the altered relations of States and the demands of our time. This is groat, good news to the world, and it comes ut an auspicious period, when tho wonderfully eventful year of 1870 is waning to its close and the holidays of the blessed Nativity are approaching to remind Christen dom of its grand privileges and ils imposing duty. No such critical moment, no sue1! glorious opportunity, has been presented to tha enlightened nations since tho signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio, which gave a pew life and a fresh lease of existence to modern liberty. On the 10th of December, 1797, or within a few days of seven ty-three years ago, the First Napolo"ry amid the splendid surroundings of the Luxcm bourc Palace, in responding to Talleyrand'* speech on the occasion of the delivery of thiit treaty, said that the French people, in order to be free, had kiigs to combat-, and in order to obtain n constitution founded on reason bad the prejudices of eighteen centurfej to ovei* come. Feudalism and despotism had gor erned Europe for two thousand years. "From tho peace which you have just concluded," continued the Dictator, "dates an era of rep resentative governments." France was, at that moment, emerging from a frightful con vulsion, as she is while wc write, and her greatest mind believed that, with her happi ness secured by sound organic laws, the order and safety of Europe would bo established. To-day the area of the case has been Im - mensely widened. The whole Continent is now where France was in 17D7. It is in the agony of that parturition which precedes a mighty birth. The conference at London will be but preliminary to a congress in which all the elements of order will have to be repre sented?the Church, the monarch* and tho people. Claiming their places by divine right and "tho grace of God," the kings must recog nize the authority of the divine law on the one hand and the sanction of the Third Estate, or people, on the other, and they must, for the Hake of prestige and precedent alike, so arrange their congress that these high ele ments shall be admitted in their appropriate places. When, very shortly before his downfall, Napoleon III. was negotiating for a European Congress to assemble at Paris, it was on all sides deemed appropriate that Home should have her distinct and prominent representa tion in that body, and Cardinal Antonelli was the delegate selected by Phis IX. to sustain the dignity and interests of his vast Church before the conclave of sovereigns and depu ties. Now that the idea, then crude and incomplete, is taking real, living shape out of the clouds and tnrmoil of the hour, let the Powers proceed to a still grander initiative. Let them invite Pius IX. to preside over the Plnropean Congress, whether it be held at London or elsewhere. Thus will the Pontiff, with the vast influences he represents, be identified with tho new era of reconciliation ; prejudices will be softened ; differences will be explained, and. wo honestly believe, the con vocation will be harmonized with both order and liberty under the broad banner of the Priuce of Peace ! pa 1 i * W ep^| be \ | The Committee ov the Fouudlixg Astluw Faib, while returning thanks to the public, tho press and tho officers of the Twenty-second regiment for tho aid tendered to make tho fair a eucoosa, announce that they will soon publish a full report of tho proceedings, in which will be furnished tha completo return? of oach table.
