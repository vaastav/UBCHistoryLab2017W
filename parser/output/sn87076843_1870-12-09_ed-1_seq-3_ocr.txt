Wilson has chosen " The Heart" as hi subject for next Sabbath morn ning. In the evening he will deliver an address to the children. We publish elsewhere the proceedings of the Masnnio installation at Tontogsny, and will give next week the able address at Rev. O. A. Adams, delivered upon that occasion. The Rev. Stxtsm D. SnArrxn is after the rnmsellers in West Milgroye, snd hasswakened the people of that village H Mi Importance of the trsfio which causes so much misery and woe. Through John Baii.st, Esq. we learn that Mr. Jon Nom.g, of Lakotwp., has raised M0 bushels of corn on four acres of land. That would be about 83 bushels of shelled corn loth acre. That beats all. The man who claims to run the SnUmel, alone, after Imposing upon a literary youth In his employ, by putting him in the position of a spy, now slinks back to his retired position snd gives utterance to his stereotyped phrase, "no influence, no circulation." We neglected in onr last issns to call atten tion to the fact that A. J. GabonrbA Co. had been especially favored with a call from Kbis Kbish.s during the last snow. Full particu lars of this visit will be found in our advertis ing columns, under the bead 1 Santa Claua Head quarters.' The Sabbath School Concert, given at the church on last Sabbath evening, was largely st touded, and passed nff very creditable to the participants. A beautiful quartet was snog by Mrs. Cook, Miss.

In another column will be found the Prespectns of the Cin cinnati Gatett for 1871, to which we-invite the attention of onr readers. For many years past w hare regarded it as one of the very best pa pers in the country ; able, patriotic and indepen dent. Each day we look for it ai earnestly as we do for our daily meals, in fact wa feel as if we could not dispense with its visits, without sustains loss. Temperance Lecture. The Methodist Church in this place wm crowded to oversow ing on last Friday evening, to listen to a lecture on Temperance from Mr. A. M. Collins. Those who hare beard JonN B. Gocsn, and also heard Mr. Collins, can testify that the let ter's abilities, in many respects, sre equal to the former. Mr. C. informs us that be will very pnrbably vi.it this place again in the course of two or three weeks. Death of Mr. Bamford. We regret to learn throngh Thomas Gobrill, Esq. of the death of Richard Bamford, which took place at the Empire House at six o'clock on Tuesday evening last. Mr. B. was about sixty-fire years of sge, a native of England, and for many years was in the employ of the Messrs. Wai.bkidoi of Toledo. He was an industrious and hard working"mao. For the past two or three years he has been in charge of the Empire House in Troy township. Exciting Trial.- Some excitemect hss been created over a trial in Justice Schwind's Court, in which JonN Fbbcksb is plaintiff, and P. Cbankbb A Sons, defendents. Two days were occupied in the first trial and the Jury failed t agree. One day was taken up in the second, and the second Jury found a verdict in favor of plain tiff forti 80. Mr.J. H. Rgio was the Attorney for plaintiff, and Mr.J. R. Ttlib for delendent. Owing to a difficulty between the Squirt and Mr. Tvleb, the former has Issued a warrant for the arrest of the Utter for contempt of Court. It Will Pnyl aud How. We heard recently of two farmers who each came to the village with a load of grain. One accepted th first offer of six cents bus:ie" over bis pieciotis sal. The other having real io his local paper of an advance of 15 to 20 ceuts per bushel, held off until be obtained Mi cents advance, or tl more than the other on 32 bushels of the same quality of grain. The paper cost him 12 for s whole year. The above instnnce was only one of several of such gains (luring the year, in s ilea, and purchases. Did th paper ptttt His fami ly know what is going on at home and abroad, and are growing up intelligent. Only last month a man received one of forty or fifty " pri vate coufiJ' litU't circulars," seut by niail to dif ferent parties oJjring great returns for $10. He sent Lii m ney, Jnd that is t'a last he can hea- from i.. Twe of his neighbors received the same 'taking' circular aud were disposed to in vest also, but turning to the A.m:riea A'jneid- urulitt they fouud the affair described among the multitude of swiudles constantly being shown up in that journal, and tbey kept tActr money. The paper cost them SI 50 a year. Did it pyt Any of our farmers may, .if they can find a copy of the Bowling Green Stntiiul, turn to tba county advertising and find it spread out and charged for by the acre, and yet they don't thiuk of the swindle until tbey see it exposed io the Perrysburg Journal. Send lice emu for a spec imen copy bf th SenltHel thst contains th 'Treasurer' Notice to Tax-payer,' snd you will find it spread over three coluoms, when not so other psper io the District has used above two columns, and many of them less. Of course pay to take your county pojxr, and after you pay your faxes you ought to have it for nothing, as you will then be a stock-holder. We could give many illustrations similar the above. The man who thinks h cannot afford ptake such papers is greatly mistaken he can not afford to be without them. Titer is not m in io the country who e iu afforl to be without at least one local paper,'ven if it be wholly filled with adrertisemeut. He will sell enough better, aun buj enough eheaper, to many times repay the cost. And when this home want supplied, we are sure it will also pay him to take such a paper as the Amiriotut Auricitltumliit. is full of good, reliable information to all mat. ters pertaining to" soil culture, upon animals, I bor-saving implements, etc., for th farm, garden and household. It has a capital deparment fur the young people and little folks, and th four to flv hundred beautiful and instructive Harai-af given every year, are atone worth many time iUooat, which is only $1 60 a yvarj or four copies for $5; ten copies for SI2j snd tweuty or more copies at 1 00 each. It is marvel of cheapness, combined with beauty and real value. The Jhirlieik AohhiI Vuluim is just beginuiug, and we ad viae all our readers to seud at out and secure it for a year.

Congress assembled on Monday last, and the President's Messago, with the reports of the De partment were promptly delivered. It affords o much pleasure to lay them before onr read er in a elear and eoncisa form In this edition of the Journal. Their Importance will seoure for them an attentive and impartial perusal. It I notable foot that the terseness of Oen. Grant's speeches and writings have hitherto oreated great favor with the publio. Tholr very brevity made tkem appear a bordoring on the neuter. Th message which h hss jnst de livered to Congress, i an exception to that rule, Th President hss amplified his View therein, so thst his capacity aa a statesman at th helm of tha ship of state m ay be fully ap prehended. Th policy Indicated by it In onr foreign rela tion in adjusting th Alabama and other claims on foreign nation, are such as will command th respeot of every eonslderat reader. Th same may also be said of it in regard to much that Is stated concerning th Internal affair of the astion. Th other matters adverted to on which, in th Republican party 'itself, a wide dif ference of opinion exists, for th reconciling o f which the President's message afford but little prospect. In th just sentiments expressed in the closing paragraph, which w give below, w may, with conn lonco, cordially endorso and sustain the Chief Magistrate, while he may use the influonee of his office in the attainment of such results t In conclusion I would sum np th policy of the administration to be a thorough enforcement of every law, a faithful eolleution of the taxes, provided Tor; economy In the disbursement or the same ) a prompt payment of the debt of the nation, a reduction of taxes as rapidly as the re quirements of the country will admit) a reduo- li n taxation anu tariu to ue wo arranged as to afford the are i teal relief to the greatest num ber; b nest and fair dealings with all other peo ples, lo the end that war. with all ita blightine consequences, m iy be avoided, but without sur rendering any right or obligation due to us ; a relorm on the treatment or the Indians, and In the whole civil service of the country, snd final ly in securing a pure, nntramnielled ballot where every man entitled to cast a vote may do so, just once at each election, without rear or molesta tion or proscription on account of bis political faith, nativity, or color.
