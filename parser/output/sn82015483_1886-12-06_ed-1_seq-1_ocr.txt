Having unsuccessfully tried to stir up the tired people of New Haven with a State House "issue," onr esteemed contemporary the Register has been looking about for some thing else with which to influence the voters to vote for Judge York. It has again brought to the light its ''prominent Republican," and vigorous palling of the string attached to him has made him assert that Mr. Trow bridge has placed himself "under the banner of a gigantic corporation," namely, the Con solidated railroad, and dark hints as to the dreadful evils which are likely to come to this Jy t h -as eleoted while under this banner are given. More nonsense, esteemed contemporary, and ranker nonsense, if that is possible, than the intimation that the election of Mr. Trow bridge would confound the enemies of New Haven's Parthenon. Perhaps it is worth while to take a look at some of the dangers which the Journal and Cotjrikh's "promi nent Democrat" sees in the candidacy of Judge York. The string having been duly palled he responds by wondering if the Bell Telephone company's monopolistic banner isn't floating over the Democratic candidate for Mayor. He sees visions of streets dark ened by the mass of wires overhead and blocked by "beautiful" poles. He sees a Democratic mayor busily engaged in signing the rights of the city away to the Bell gang and finally surrendering to them the city charter and thirty-five per cent, of the taxes collected, which is quite reasonable for the Bell company. . He takes another look and sees another banner floating. It is the ban ner of that gigantic corporation, the Stand ard Oil company. This company is laying a 'pipe line" through the principal streets and is turning the City Hall into an oil reservoir. Should Judge York be elected under any such banner! But this is not all. Oar prominent Democrat" can see still more. He sees the black and piratical banner of the gigantic coal ring. He sees coal rising at the rate of fifty cents per ton a day, and a Dem ocratic mayor of New Haven acting as the agent of the ring and obscuring the white and pare beauty of our Parthenon by per mitting mountains of black and dirty coal to be piled high around it on the Green. These are sad sights, indeed. No sadder, of coarse, than the banner of the Consoli dated road, bnt just as sad. Are the voters of this city less afraid of the banners of the Bell Telephone company,, the Standard Oil company and the anthracite coal ring than of the banner of the Consolidated roadf We trow not. - EDITORIAL MOTES. The President's message will, it is expect ed, contain about 1 5,000 words. Yesterday was a day of savage wintry winds, bnt there are several politicians in this city who are realizing that wintry winds are more endurable than man's ingratitude. The new navy that has been started is very much needed. We have now in commission only twenty-two ships, all of wood, worthless for fighting purposes. Of these three are in the North Atlantio squadron, three- in the South Atlantic, six in the Asiatic waters, seven in the Pacific and three in oar Euro pean squadron. Beside these are five old vessels engaged in surveying or in the train ing squadron, and the new despatch boat, the Dolphin. The total loss by fire in the United States and Canada for this year has already reached the enormous amount of $ 105, 000,000, the total for November being not less than $10, 000,000. It was feared by many a few months ago thai, the loss of This year would reach $100,000,000, but it has now exceeded that amount with the contribution of another month, December, yet to hear from. The November fire loss was one-third greater than the average for that month since 1872. Such a waste as this is saddening. Some curious facts have ootne to light in St. Louis in connection - with the crusade against oleomargarine. One of the leading restaurants in the city was visited and the discovery made that the substance used as batter was about three-fifths oleo. The dis covery was a great surprise to the proprietor of the establishment, inasmuch as he always purchased his butter or what he supposed to be butter irom a farmer who kept twen ty good cows, and to whom he paid an extra price to Insure his getting the best genuine article. So great was his chagrin at the dis covery that he has given up all faith in hu man nature. He is determined to have an analysis of the article used, and if the farmer 1 has been defrauding him be intends refusing to pay a balance of nearly $100 which he still owes on his last purchase. The Michigan Central railroad is preparing to build ferryboats that will run winter and summer across the Straits of Mackinac. Of course there is much ice there in the winter, end to get through the ice each boat will have a screw at each eud, the stern wheel to have one-third greater power than the bow wheel When running through comparatively clear water or smooth ice the bow wheel will pull and the stern wheel will pnsh. Its crushing power will be immense, and its projectors say that it will walk through ice two or two and a half feet thick with perfect ease. When it meets the great floes, so common in the straits, it is expected, that the front screw will posh the boat back and the rear screw will push her ahead. The greater strength or the rear screw will push the boat up against the floe while the powerful currents circling ahead from the front screw will wash a passage in the fioe and allow the ferryboat to run through. The action of the Republican city conven tion in nominating Mr. . Trowbridge is thus commended by the Hartford Courant: "Mr. Thomas R. Trowbridge, jr., Republican and citizens' candidate for Mayor of New Haven, is a lineal and worthy representative of one of New Haven's historical families, identi fied with the growth of the place from its earliest days to the present. He has always taken an active interest in public affairs end everything pertaining to the well-being of the city, and is in every way worthy of the position for which he has been nominated. In the present very mixed condition of Dem ocratic politics in New Haven it would not be surprising if he should be elected by a handsome majority." And -the New' Lon don Cay has the following to say: "The popularity of Thomas R. Trowbridge, jr., among his fellow Republicans of New Haven was demonstrated by his nomination for Mayor after he had formally declined the nse of his name and in spite of the fact that the, nomination was actively sought by oth ers. Mr. Trowbridge will prove a strong candidate. He belongs to a family which has long bean most honorably identified with the business and commercial interests of the city of New Haven. ' He is a man of the highest character of business ability, and experience in municipal affairs. He is in every ' respect a thoroughly representative man."
