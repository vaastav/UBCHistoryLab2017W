VIEWS ON LABOR MATTERS President Roosevelts message to the Fiftyninth Congress of the United States was presented and read to that body on Tuesday It is one of the deepest and most comprehensive messages ever pre sented to that body Simultaneous with its presentation to Congress it appeared in the daily papers in every city in the lifted States Theodore Roosevelt is a typical of the best American types He never flinches when he has a duty to perform After congratulating Congress on tbi peaceful state of affairs and our relations to mankind he jumps right into the question of corporations The gist of his message on this subject is as fol lows I do not believe in the Government interfering in private business more than is necessary I do not believe in the Government undertaking any work which can with propriety be left in private hands but neither do I believe in the Government flinching from overseeing any work when it becomes evident that therein unless abuses are sure to obtain there is Governmental supervision Then the President turns his attention to railroad rates and says It sometimes happens as at present not that a rate is too high but that a favored shipper is given too low a rate In such case the Commission would have the right to fix 1 this already established minimum rate as the maximum and it would need only one or two such decisions by the Com mission to cure railroad companies of = tfaepracUce of giving improper minimum rates Next he turns his attention to the lack of safety appliances on railroads and ad vises Congress to provide legislation for the introduction of the block signal sys tem The President also asks Congress to give attention to the excessive hours of labor to which railroad employes in I train service are in many cases subjected The strain both mental and physical upon those who are engaged In the move ment and operation of railroad trains under modern conditions is perhaps 4greater than that which exists in any other industry and if there are any rea sons for limiting by law the hours of labor in any employment they certainly apply with peculiar force to the employ ment of those upon whose vigilance and alertness In the performance of their duties the safety of all who travel by P rail depends says the message On the subject of labor as a whole he decries Government interference on the ground that each State should take care of its own labor problems At the same time he advocates that Congress take such measures in the District of Colum tola as will make that a model as to hous lug parks honrs ot labor etc Congress is also asked to investigate child labor and woman In Industry In discussing labor troubles the President says In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employ inter ested but also a third partythe gen Aral public Every considerable labor difficulty in which interstate commerce is involved should be investigated by the Government and the facts officially reported to the public He condemns the strife between masses and classes and arrives at this conclusion In the past the most dlrefnl among the influences which have brought about the downfall of republics has ever been the growth of the class spirit the growth of the spirit which tends to make a man subordinate the welfare of the welfare of the public as a whole to the y particular class to which he belongs the substitution of loyalty to a class for loy alty to the nation In concluding his remarks on the classes he says This Government la not and never shall be a Government by a plutocracy This Government is not and never shall be a Government by a mob The President also pays his respects to the insurance situation revenues econ omy in expenditures the currency ques tion federal election the Hague peace conference the Monroe doctrine San Domingo the navy and immigration On the last mentioned subject he says The question of immigration is of vital interest to this country In the year ending June 30 1905 there came to the United States 1026000 alien immi grants In other words in the single o year that has just elapsed there came to this country a greater number of people than came here daring the 169 years of our colonial life which intervened be tween the first landing at Jamestown and the Declaration of Independence It Is clearly shown in the report of the Com iniwlbn r General of tmmfgralioa that while much of this enormous immigra tion is undoubtedly healthy an natural 0 bl from one reason or another moreover a considerable proportion of it probably c very large proportion including most of the undesirable class does not come here of its own initiative but because of the activity of the agents of the great trans portation companies These agencle are distributed throughout Europe and by the offer of all kinds of inducement they wheedle and cajole many immi grants often against their best interest to come here The most serious obstacle o we have to encounter in the effort to I secure a nroper regulation of the immi gration to these shores arises from the determined opposition of the foreign I steamship lines who have no interest whatever in the matter save to increase the returns on their capital by carrying masses of immigrants hither in the steerage quarters of their ships President Roosevelt will stand for no discrimination against the classes of im migrants but he wants a standard of cit lzenship set and maintained He say In dealing with this question it is un wise to depart from tbe old American tradition and to discriminate for or against any man who desires to come here and become a citizen save on the ground of that mans fitness for citizen ship It is our right and duty to con sider his moral and social equality His standard of living should be such that he will not by pressure of competition lower thestandard of living of our own wageworkers for It must ever be a prime object of our legislationto keep high their standard of living If the man who seeks to come here is from the moral and social standpoint uf such a character as to bid fair to add vplue to the community he should be heartily welcomed We can not afford to pay heed to whether he is of one creed or an other of one nation or another We can not afford to consider whether he is Catholic or Protestant Jew or Gentile whether he is Englishman or Irishman Frenchman or German Japanese Italian Scandinavian Slav or Magyar What we should desire to find out is the indi vidual quality of the individual man Every line of the Presidents message Is I good The Kentucky Irish American has only picked out a few of the more salient features It is well worth read ing and digesting digestingGREAT

Substitute For Irish Sapc Latest Movement In Ireland Takes in All Glasses dof People Progress That Has Been Made Since the Gaelic Re vival Began POINTS FROM DR HYDES ADDRESS Will the people of the Irish race in America hearken to the voice of Dr Douglas Hyde In the address delivered in New York at his first public reception he said among other things And when once you in America un derstand thatand I shall have failed in my mission if I do not make you under stand Itthen I know that you will join us in saying to the devouring demon of anglicization in Ireland which with its foul and gluttonous jaws has swallowed up one after another everything that was hereditary natural instinctive ancient intellectual and noble in our race our language our music our songs our in dustries our dances and our pastimes I know I say that you will plant your feet firmly and will cry with us Back demon back Not one other mouthful shall you swallow of the heritage of the Irish nationI I The Irish race the fathers and mothers of the present race of Irish Americans really lived in the closest contact with the traditions of the past and the natioi d life of nearly eighteen hundred years until the beginning of the nineteenth century Even during the dark penal times they produced among themselves a most vigorous liter ary development Thomas Davis and the Young Irelanders come just at the parting of the ways when the nation was as it were still in a state of flux and capable of being turned either to one side or the other Thomas Davis that Irishman without fear and without re proach whose name shall live forever In the grateful hearts of his countrymen and the Young Irelanders generally pro duced a new literature throughout the country It was a literature in which they strove to compete with England herself upon Englands own lines The effect was enormous for a time but it can not be said to be enduring The fact is that the bark had been so recently stripped off the stem of the Irish tree that the attempt to replace it by a new bark stuck on as it were with English gum and glue failed to stick fast or to incorporate Itself with the ancient stem and finally fell off from it as it were in flakes English gum is no substitute and never can be a substitute for Irish sap We have opened the eyes of the entire nation to the awful chasm that lay before them into which they were about to step blindfold the yawn > ing gulf of anglicization which believe me is only another name for national extinctionNow Now the movement upon which we are engaged is not the movement of a few faddistsIt pas long passed put of that stage Papers in Ireland whose policy is on other matter radically opposed to one another are now at last as one in recognizing the necessity of our move meat Churchmen like the Archbishop of Dublin and the Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh are as one with us upon it Even the organ of the Independent Orangeman who has receded from the official body says It is a movement no Protestant need be ashamed of So that you see we have now a great mass of public opinion in Ireland behind us And you also see that we are no clique no faction no party but Hint wf embrace some of all parties and all factions and that offending nobody ex cept the antiIrishman We stand firm upon the pure unmovable bedrock of Irish nationality In one word we mean to deanliclze Ireland meanI I I honor and respect most sincerely I what is good in the great English race I yield to no man in my appreciation of their perseverance their practical quali ties The characteristics of the Celtic race are perhaps lightness brightness wit fluency readiness and an artistic temperament Those of the Teutonic and AngloSaxon people are rather stead Incas perseverance and business faculties Each race can learn something from the other but neither can successfully cut itself adrift from its own past Has this crusade amounted to any thing A dozen years ago the Gaelic language was taught f in less than a dozen schools Six years ago it was taught In 105 schools Today it is tanght more or leas in 3000 schools Between public and parochial schools colleges and con vents there can not be IBM than a quar ter of a million now < studying the tan guage and history of their forefathers Six years ago if you spoke Irish as well asOweu Roe ONeill or wrote it as well as Goeff rey Keating it was not worth a thraneen to yon Today you can not obtain a place under corporation inn the capital of Ireland or under the County Council of Cork Mayo or Limerick or > n a down other pl cf unless you know < Ihe I national language of the country Dr Hyde in conclusion blamed the blatajthe Irish people themselves for the drifting away from the Irish language and cus toms He spoke scornfully of the pa rents who were discarding the old Irish names for their children and even more L bitterly of Irish families which aban doned their original names

RAPID GROWTH Or the Catholic Church In Australia Shown by Pastoral Cardinal Moran and the other members of the Australian hierarchy recently held a plenary council and at its close the following statistics were given out in a general pastoral letter Our Catholic population in Australasia has grown to something over a million 1011550 The clergy number over 1300 the teaching brothers over 600 the nuns over 5500 We maintain thirtythree colleges for boys and 160 boarding schools for girls 215 rnperlor day schools 1087 primary schools ninety four charitable institutions and the chil dren in Catholic schools number over 127000 From these figures it can be seen that although ours Is a land which has developed and grown with the rapid ity of adolescence the church has pro gressed also even so as to keep well to the front among the most progressive in stitutions of the country NEW SEE His Lordship Bishop Grace of Sacra mento Cal who is now in Rome is try ing to prevail upon the church author ides to divide his diocese He has a mountain territory of 100000 square milestoo much for any Bishop to cover either by land or sea It is hoped the diocese will be divided and that Reno Nevada will be the seat of a new diocese In that event the See of Sac ramento will be confined to the northern part of California is QUARTERLY MEETING The metnDcrs of the various confer ences of the St

realized that the Irish party legislation islation for England until some measure of relief was granted to Ireland Lord Rosebery who was until recent ly a supporter of Sir Henrys policy will doubtless be left out of the Cabinet since he came out in opposition to horns rule a few days ago John Morley will doubt less be the head of Indian affairs while Herbert Henry Asquith will be Chancel lor of the
