Rum, Romanism and Rebellion Bur chard and Mr. Cleveland have become warm fiiends. This is a misfortune that In our heart we never wished might come to the Democratic party. It lakes about 1,590,000 tons of salt to supply tne American market. About one-third of this quantity is imported, which shows that there is plenty of room for the Kansas salt miues to prove profit able. It was not partisanship that prompted the vigorious response that the wool growers made to Mr. Cleveland's thrust nt the vitals of that interest in his mes sage; it was simply the instinct of self peraervation the first law of nature. The Arkansas City Republican-Traveler says there is talk of putting on extra police in that city to keep the crowd moving. The extra police are required in "Wichita to keep the crowd from run ning over people. The poet's idyl is oft times a bewilder ing misnomer, more frequently so, in fact, than a fructifying realization to the romancer. In the case of Harper, the Fidelity bank wrecker, "the path of glory lead" not "to the grave," but to state's prison. The Chicago Tribune is displeased with the Blaine interview, and predicts that no national party cau elect a president in this country on such a platform as the Maine statesman outline'- lonsidering that Colonel Joe Medil) nas for a long time been classed among the free traders, his opinion on this point is about as im portant as Mr. Cleveland's. The medical profession now allege that the sore throat of the German prince im perial was caused bj' diseased teeth: not hy cancer. His teeth have been extracted and he is getting well. Thus the ene niiss of tobacco, who claim the cancer was caused by smoking, as in the case of General Grant, are deprived of a good point. The Kansas City Times has been a rather gloomy paper for some time past. It recently however, employed a regular correspondent at this place since which time its editorial columns are illuminat ed with brilliant comments on the metropolis of Kansas. This is the sort of enterprise which the readers of that paper will no doubt commend. "When John J. Ingalls looks through his glasses at Susan Anthony and Susan looks through her glasses at Mr. Ingalls the Courier-Journal concludes there has been a discussion. Some day Senator Ingalls will look through his glasses at the Courier-Journal and then Henry "Watterson will see another Star of Bethlehem. "We may laugh and poke fun at "Wichita and call it names, but it ib really a great town and deserving of all the pneiiomeiml progress it has achieved. It is a credit to Kansas and the entire west. Abilene Gazette. A frank acknowledgement of an hon est paper that is itself published in a splendid little city. Just what the oth ers would all say if they possessed the Gazette's candor and just discrimina tion. It is settled that General Banks, one of the few remaining Republican officials, must lose his head as soon as his teun expires, which is soon. Mr. Lovering, late Democratic candidate for governor, is booked for the place. Another noble exemplification of the beauty and wise discrimination of civil service reform as practiced by a Democratic administra tion. The Eagle Jinds much pleasure in chronicling the safe return of Col. M. Stewart and his estimable wife from their six-months' tour of Europe, North Africa and the Holy Land, and gladly welcome them to their home in this city. The readers of the Eagle have been re galed with vivid descriptions of the wonderful places, peoples and things seen by its versatile correspondent, and while they join us in a most cordial "welcome home," they can but wish that his sojourn and visits might have been extended indefinitely. The Kansas City Times illustrates a remark that is frequently made that peo ple do sometimes arrive at the same con clusion by .reasoning from different propositions. A great many people come to the conclusion that because so many industries have been established . in "Wichita during this year, and that be cause of her unprecedented building boom that Wichita must as a matter of fact be a great city. The Times con cludes that "Wichita is a great city be cause one of her drug firms sold 2.000, 000 bottles of beer in three months. However, we will not quarrel with you so long as your conclusions about "Wich ita are correct. The "Washington correspondent of the New York Herald has succeeded in ob taining an opinion from Mr. Randall in regard to the president's "pointers' on the tariff. He says taxes will be- cut down 00,000.000 or more this session, "but not on the exact line of the presi dent's suggestions." All kinds and forms of tobacco will be wholly relieved from taxation. Mr. Randall thinks, as will also distillations from fruits peach brandy, applejack, etc. Coining to the tarifT, bethinks the free lL-t will le enlarpHl.,.and there will be-considerable reductions in the schedules of duties, hut without injury to established useful industries or the wages of labor. He would be glad, he says, to see the tariff relieved of its inequalities and ambigui ties, and "simplified generally." Sugar, in iiis judgment, should be. let alone. m 

FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED. President Cleveland's message to Con gress has created a distrust throughout the entire country. And as time passes this distrust increases. At first reading Mr. Clevalandls words did not make much impression on the country. People had time and again heard, the same ideas that were made prominent; in this mes sage, promulgated by advocates of free trade like Carlisle and Morrison. They had learned to regard these notions as as mistaken ideas of men, honest though they might be, who could never obtain a majority in Congress. The sound of a cannon in New York city would hardly cause a comment. But should it be learned that the re port was caused by a cannon from some foreign gunboat. That it was an unfriendly shot directed at the city it would cause a commotion in every ham let and city in this land. So when the people learn that this erroneous idea that this country should submit to internal taxation in order that foreign goods might be landed free of import duties on our seacoasts, has been recommended by a president of these United States, they are alarmed. The business men in every city and village are discussing the inju rious effect which will result to our com merce. Down by the blazing forges and along the busy thorough-fares, where is heard the hum of machin-ery, and all the busy manufacturing centers of our land when the day's work is done the workmen gather in groups and talk of their pros pects when the products of their labor are brought in open competition with the half paid labor of Europe. All over this country from Maine to Texas in numerable farmers surrounded by their bleating herds are contemplating the wrothlessness of such herds when they are compelled to compete in open market with Australian wool. These forbodings of evil among the class of people we have enumerated are the beacon lights on the rock bound coasts of political error which will en able the people to steer clear of the free trade rocks upon which Mr. Cleve land, if left alone, would wreck the pros pei ity of our country. "Fore-warned is fore-armed.'' The people of this country, naturally confid ing, might have been led astray by this administration if its designs had not been made known, but now that they understand its object to be taxation for Americans and free trade for foreigners Mr. Cleveland will go down before the American people. Unfortunately for him the friends he made in England are not voters here. 

SENATOR INGALLS OPINION. Of the multitude of opinion and con victions of the statesmen of the couutry touching the position of Mr. Cleveland upon the treasury surplus and the tariff none we have seen covers the points dis cussed with the clearness and perspecuity of Senator Ingalls, of this state. Says ho: '"I think the surplus ought to be re duced, but my idea as to its reduction is far different from that generally offered. The surplus is- a benefit to the nation rather than a detriment. It should be a matter of pride rather than humiliation, and there litis never been a government in history which, with a people as pros-" perous as ours, has had more millions in its treasury than sufficed for its need. 1 would spend this surplus in bettering the condition of the country. "' The senator's plan is to establish a great national normal college for train ing teachers, as soldiers are trained at West Point and sailors at Annapolis. These teachers he would send under government pay to establish schools where they are needed to battle with ig norance. This plan he regaids as far preferable to the absurd and extravagant and unconstitutipnal scheme of Mr. Blair, but even this plan is open to objection. Next, Mr. Ingalls would expend the sur plus in providing suitable coast defenses, in building up a respectable navy, and hi erecting government buildings wher ever the government is obliged to pa' rent forjbuildings. To the reply that "the people are com plaining about the taxes," the senator made this very sensible reply: You are mistaken. The people are not complaining of taxation. The "burdens of taxation" is a dishonest phra.se in vented by demagogues. They howl at the "burdens of taxation" because the phrase sounds well, and the idea is pop ular. It is the demagogue's stock in trade. The people of the Unites States pay their taxes without feeling them, i and those winch it is proposed to reduce in cutting down the "surplus." are those which are least felt and which are voluntarily paid. The amount con- J tributed by each individual is so small as to be inappreciable. This constant j uproar about the "burdens of taxation" is as sensible as an assault iixn the laws of nature would be by the assertion that every man is sustaining ' an atmospheric pressure of several bun-1 dred pounds upon every square inch of his bod. It would seem like an intol- erable hardship if all the other facts were suppressed, as these demagogues sup-, press everv other fact in the"great prob lem of political economy with which they profess to deal. If you don't care i to pay the tax on whisky, you can get i rid of it by letting whisky alone. If 1 1 don't smoke my cigar, take snuff or chew tobacco. I avoid the tobacco tax. as far I as I am concerned, and even were the i tax taken off, I don't believe it would re- j duce the retail price of whisky, or beer, j or tobacco. "We pay. they say. $17,000.- uw a year duty out of the $100,000,000 worth of sugar which we buy. The fig ures sound big, and when it is consid ered that the tax is levied to support the industries of Louisiana, whose annual production of sugar" has never amounted to' more than" $20,000. U00 and the product of which has often run down to . 12,000,000. it does sound rather inconsistent. But if the tax wore taken off sugar and export duty would undoubtedly le levied in Ctikt and else where, and the result would be no cheaper to the consumer than now. It was so with coffee and tea. The articles were no cheajier after being placed on the free list. The producing countries paid an export tax. The consumer pays the old price anil the foreign govern ment gets the profits instead of Uncle Sam. As to wljisky and tobacco, these are purchased by the consumer in such small quantities that the retail price would not be reduced. Secretary Fairchild says that under the present tariff, which is so low on competing foreign goods, the making of worsted fabrics will soon be extinct in this country. That is in his report, and yet Cleveland says our manufacturers "always" realize "Immense profits," and that if the duties are reduced they still would have no right to reduce wages'. Many of them would shut their doors altogether. A "Washington attorney and claim agent has begun mandamus proceedings in the supreme court of the District of Columbia to compel the "Washington postmatser to receive and forward as second-class matter his circulars having his business cards printed on the envel opes Postmaster General "Vilas' order to the contrary notwithstanding. Business people all over the country will await the action of the court on this audacious attorney's position with lively interest. THE 

SPEAKERSHIP. Xew York World, Mr. Carlisle is now entering upon his thi.id term as speaker, and when he has completed it Kentucky will have had the speakership twentj'-three years. New York has not had a speaker since the days of John Quincy Adams, when John "W. Taylor closed his term, and she h.'is been represented only three years in the speaker's chair since the beginning of our government. Kentucky ranks the other states of the Union as a fur nisher of speakers of congiess, and Vir ginia comes next, with just two-thirds the period of service, or four teen years. Pennsylvania has held the speakership eleven years, Mas sachusetts ten years, Indiana eight years, Main, North Carolina and New jersey six years, Ohio four years, and Georgia, when Howell Cobb was speaker, two. Henry Clay is the only man in our history who has sat more than eight years in the speaker's chair. He pre sided over the house for twelve years, and he was elected speaker at the age of 31 and during his first term in the house of representatives. He did not confine himself to his duties as a pre siding officer, but took a leading part in debate on almost all important occasions. It was his failure to become president and that of ex-Speaker James G. Blaine that has given rise to the superstition that no speaker of the. house will ever be president of the United States; and. indeed, considering that these were the two most popular men in our political histoiy there seems to be a sort of" fatality about it. But some day an ex-speaker will be led into the "White House and the fatality will go to the winds. The first speaker of the house of repre sentatives was Frederick A. Muehlen berg, a Lutheran preacher of Philadel phia, whose statue now stands in statu ary hall in the- Capitol. It is a life-size figuie of white marble, bearing an effem inate face and dressed in knee breeches, with the legs so adjusted that the whole looks like an instantaneous phonograph of a pedestrian in action. "When Mueh lenbeig was elected the seat of govern ment was in New York. The president, George Washington, had been taken from Virginia, and Massachusetts had boen given the vice-presidency in John Adams. The speakership naturally fell to 'Pennsylvania, and Muehlenberg, who had been sneaker of the Pennsvlvania legislature, was chosen. He served two terms in the speaker's chair, presiding over the First and Third congresses, and he gave as chairman of the committee of thep whole the casting vote in favor of the law required to carry Jay's treaty into effect. Illinois has never had a speaker of the house or a president of the senate, and no speaker has ever lived west of the Mississippi. Rhode Island and Dela ware, among the eastern states, have never b"en honored with the speaker ship, and neither Louisiana nor Alabama has ever had a speaker. When Carlisle closes this congress ho will have had as many years in the chair as had Blaine, Colfax and Nathaniel Macon, of Noith Carolina, and between him and Henry Clay, in point of service, there will only stand Andrew Stevenson, of Virginia, avIio served eiht years as speaker and whose term closed during tlje second administration of Andrew Jackson. Jackson made him minister to England, and upon his return he devoted himself to agriculture and literature, Cineinnatus-like preferring his farm to the field of public action. 

CREMATION IN CINCINNATI. Cincinnati Enquirer. The bodj' of an old and respected citi zen, Mr. John Galvangi, was cremated at the crematoej", on Dixmyth avenue, yesterday morning. The cremation was ai ranged to take place at 9 o'clock, but owing to the impassable condition of the loads, and the fact that the Clifton cable is being laid on Ludlow avenue, the funeral cortege was compelled to go around by Biowne street, and it was fully 11 o'clock before the hearse bear ing the corpse, followed by fitteen car riages, wound up the steep hill and de posited its burden at the house for incin eration. The coffin was taken into the incinera tion furnace, and remained for a few minutes, where the friends of the family gazed upon the familiar features for the last time. Rev. Hugo G. Eisenlohr, pas tor of the German Evangelical Protest ant chinch, on the northwest corner of Twelfth and Elm streets, made a few remarks and the corpse was removed into the preparatory room, where it was laid out of the coffin on an iron stretcher, about six feet long, and covered with a linen sheet soaked m a solution of alum. Flowers were placed on the breast, and the attendants, transporting the body to the front of the furnace, opened the two large iron doors and shoved the stretcher audits contents into the oven. The doors were quickly closed, and in an hour and fifteen minutes the body,which in life weighed 50 pounds, was reduced to four pounds of ashes. Today they will be gathered up and placed by the family of the deceased in the family lot at Spring Grove cemetery. It was the wish of the deceased that his remains be cremated, and although some memlers of the family objected to this method of dispo-ing of the dead, yet at a family conference .deference was paid to the father's wishes. A great crowd of people was present, and among them one old lady who said she had never been to a cremation before. "Why. I thought they were all atheists,5 she saiil. "but I see a preacher here.'' "Oh. yes. madam: this is the fifth clergyman that has. conducted religious services at the crematory." The old lady was much pleased, and declared that she was a religious woman, but be lieved in cremation. This is the tenth cremation that has transpired in this city. Kansas i always to the front.

Winter The Outlook Machine Politcia The Pretended Territorial Council. Beaver City, N. S., L T., Dec. 5. To the Editor of the Eagle. Our winter, so far, is quite Italian, only one blizzardy day; the snow accom panying it and that which preceeded and came after, with some gentle show ers of rain, with the freeze and thaw-out, has put a good season in the ground and plowing has commenced, all favorable to the next crop. Stock is still keeping fat on the ranges. While some of our people have left to winter over, about as many more are coming in and the popu lation remains the same. All are looking forward with anxiety to what congress may do to open the strip for moretpermanent and rapid set tlement. Two delegates have gone on to Washington to represent us in con gress and hurry up this matter; one elected by a process gotten up and carried out through a delegated convention of the people, which was held at Bothwell last September. The other delegate was elected under the auspices of a political machine called the territorial council of "Cimarron territory," gotten up and chiefly managed by" one man, himself now the delegate to congress. The coun cil, which is pretty much a creature of his own hands, passes resolutions of in structions, pretending to voice the peo ple, and send them on to Washington to enlighten congressmen, etc. (I would just say in parenthasis that said reso lutions' are dictated if not written by the said delegate before he left, and the whole thing, machine and its environ ments, made more effective by the ' in spiration of Sid Clark, of Kansas, on his mission tour to the strip last fall.) This same pretended council of Cimarron ter ritoiy which has been flaunted so much of late, in public prints, met in Beaver today. Out of the full dele gation for the whole strip re ported to have been elected, twenty-three in all, only nine put in an appearance; and all of them but one in the immediate vicinity of Beaver, and he only three miles away. The organ ization of the concern was stereotyped. The committee on credentials counted out or counted in as it best suited tho purposes of the machine. The object was to get those who would serve, and be of one mind; and to do this, the- dropped out whn ever a certificate of election had been- issued and substituted others instead. Then to secure a quoroum of all the members pretended to have been elected, vacancies, or absentees are filled by the council itself. The organization and running of this bogus council is as big a farce as the election was a fraud upon the people. Two or three men got up the election: placed such men on the ticket as were of the same opinion of the ring masters, some by their own con sent and others without their consent. Polls were opened wherever the most voles could be had for the ticket. The largest returns were made from places never before or since heard of in the strip; and these returns, tickets, poll books, tally sheets and all, were made to one man the son-in-law of the machine's congressman in the name, however, for appearances sake, of the secretary of the bogus territorial council. The resolu tions and acts of such a pretended terri torial council, claiming to voice the peo ple of this public land strip, aie of no more authority than an equal number of men assembled for a similar purpose of expressing their opinions anywhere in the strip, and they are no more than an average for intelligence and hardly an average for honesty. And yet, such political schemers, honor-seekers and as pirants are deceiving the public and even attempting to impose upon congress by asking for some sort of recognition. They.don't love law and order half so much as they love fame and self agrau dizement. Tun Neutral Spy. THE SOUTH WEAKENING. rt-a Clohc-Deniocrat. The president has made the tariff the great dividing issue between the parties. The tariff, to be sure, has for years been the dominant question in our politics, but it did not enterinto presidential or congressional canvasses so vitally and thoroughlv as it is now certain to do in the canvass of 18S8. While the Republic-ins have been the friends and the Democrats the foes of the protective pol icy, the Democrats have never had either the political courage or the political honesty to accept the Republi cans' challenge to draw the line rig idly on the tariff issue, and submit the question to the verdict of the people. The president in his message, the secretary of the treasury in his report and the speaker in his address to the house on taking his chair, have presented the issue so clearly and boldly that Dem cratic quibbling, shufiling and straddling on this question will be impossible, in the coming canvass at least. The south, which is the Democratic stronghold, has been supposed, for two thirds of a century past, to be committed to free trade. For a large part of the time this supposition was true, but it is not true now to the extent or in the sense which it was true a few years ago. The development and diversification of indus tries in that region have modified the views of its people on the tariff ques tion. The South still wants "revenue reform," but a large and important ele ment m it desires to bring this reform about by wiping out the internal revenue system. This element has able and con spicuous journals and well known and influential political, leaders. The utter ances of these journals and these lead ers, so far as we have seen them chroni cled in the past few days, have been antagonistic to the p Hey marked out by the president. The Democratic part- has for years been clamoring for the reduction of "war taxes." The new and progressive element of the party in the south de clares that the real "war taxe3'' are the internal revenue taxes, and they de- j mand that these be stricken off before , the tariff is- touched. The president and j the leaders of the dominant branch of j the party demand that the internal taxes ' romnin jis now- mid that the enfirp ro- 1 duction of the revenue be made upon the tariff. Here is a conflict between the Democratic factions which the party organs ean not .conceai, and which party discipline can not sup press. With this new element in the South the Republican party is. to some extent, in harmony. The Republicans would abolish the tax on tobacco, as well as upon alcohol used in the arts. Such other reductions of revenue as would be required by the Republicans would make revising the tariff, although keeping the interests of tiie American toiler em ployer and employed carefully in vie-w. The presidents "message, m fat t, has weakened the Democratic line in the southern statJs. The Republicans di break it next November if they make a f a wie presidential nomination and an intelligent and vigorous. canvass m tL , south on the tariff question. ; The Original and Only. Top-5.

BORDER QUEEN, Caldwell, Kan., Dec. 9, 1SS7. To the Editor of the Dally- Eagle: Please tell the people that the little Border Queen is neither dead nor asleep, but quietly adding to lier charms. Yes; Caldwell has been building right along, and making preparations to receive the vast throng of immigration the coming spring. Several propositions have been made to the board of trade, yiz: A cracker factory; foundry; cigar factory and roller mill, all of which have been favorably received and acted upon. The board of trade has received about $'2o, 000 in subscription for the above and other enterprises. The people hereabout generally are en thusiastic over the prespect of the open ing up of the territory, and all praise the Eagle in the stand she has taken in opening up the same. The Rock Island railroad is doing some substantial Avork here by putting in twor iron bridges over Fall and Bluff creek, and from the general outlook said road will begin work in the territory this win ter, and there is no question but what Caldwell will have a through line to Gal vestion by the 4th of July next. We had a .$20,000 fire, partly insured. Street cars and electric light have been before the council under consideration, and before spring sets in both will be in course of construction. L. WHO CAN TELL? To the Editor of the Eagle: I want to get the address of two brothers who passed through this place about thirty days ago with a flock of sheep, a small flock of bucks, a cabin on a wagon, a feed wagon, etc. Driving the bucks was a mulatto boy. about 14 or 10 years of age. This boy came to my barn in Augusta, on Friday night, De cember 2. and on Sunday, the 4th, was found lying by the side of the 'Frisco railroad, about two miles east of Au gusta, with his shoulder out of place and badly bruised about the head and neck, and last niglit he died. My object is to find where he belongs, as he was in sensible when -found. He told my boys he was bearding sheep for Roberts Bros. , about ten miles west of Wichita. Yours. D. Stixe. Augusta, Kan., December 11, 1SS7. FROMn6MAN'S LAND. Xew York Sun. Washington is awaiting with' eome interest the arrival of the delegate from Xo Plan's Land. A "great many people will be surprised to learn that there is such a province under the shadow of the American lias:. It will only be found under that name on the older maps. It is the disputed strip of country north of the pan handle of Texas, whose inhabi tants recently held a convention and elected officers. A territorial delegate is on his wav here to ask for a stat in con-; gress and admission for their .sec tion into the United States as the territory of Cimarron. Tho name is derived from the largest river which flows through the piopoed territory. This land appears on the maps at the in terior department as '-public land.' It is a parallelogram thirty miles wide, larger than the state of "Delaware and nearly as large as New Jersey. It is bounded on the north by Colorado and Kansas, on the east by Indian Territory, on the south by Texas, and on the west by New Mexico. The Cimarron river rises near the northwestern boundary and empties into the Arkansas river in the Indian Territory. Cimanon territory came into the pos session of the United States in ISIS, un der what is known as the Florida treaty with Spain, by which treaty we secured Florida but'lost Texas. The pioposed territory of Cimarron is the most sys tematical division of the United States. Not far to the south of it, in Texas and in New Mexico, is the high table land known as the Llano Estacado, or "staked plains"" which forms the, eastern base of the Rocky mountains and rises to tho height of over 2,000 feet. The vote of the new delegate will be Democratic. EXCHANGE SEOTS. Pasteur's Plan, State Journal.
