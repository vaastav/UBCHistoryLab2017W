Washington, Dec. 4.—The attitude dt the administration today with re card to the peace treaty waa that of watchful waiting." declaring __________ that a great popular de mend for ratification will come from »'• > country within a few weeks. Pres ident Wilson is keeping "handii off" the present situation waiting for this urge to materialise according to numer ous Indications. The president refrained from direotly mentioning the treaty in his message to congress, it is believed with the idea that further argument was useless. The need for it. friends of the ad ministration predict, will steadily be come more apparent. They are looking for events to convince the people that the treaty Is desirable and that no, other means of bringing about official pence will do. The president s silence, they assert, does not mean that he has given tip the fight or that he is any less interested in ratification than when he toured the country appealing loi It. Thul ne is 'wrapped up In the treaty" was the expression used by some of his advisers In describing the a.luation. . Hecommendution of AVilson for a third term by the state convention at Pierre, S. I)., was interpreted by the president's supporters as endorsement of the treaty and as an answer to the arguments of those who claim the pact is iu dead that the Democrats Mill not want f> exhume it and make It an Issue in lil-'O. Opponents of the treaty openly scoff rt the iriei that the nation will de mand ratification.

CRISIS CLOSE fContlnued from Page One.) not favored by American border offi cials for a showdown, but contributes to show Carranza's "lack of good faith," they say. 3. Merc Americans are in Mexico than at any time since the exodus which followed President Taft's first warning to Americans to leave that revolution-ridden country. Americans have flocked into the Tampico oil re gions. The boom in the silver market has resulted in hundreds of American returning to Mexican camps and smel ter plants. 

SLEEP BEHIND 8TOCKADE8. In Parral, the Americans sleep nightly behind a stockade, heavily armed and with sentries on guard to prevent a surprise assauli. The "last straw" may be another murder of an American. Kail's charges of the spread of Bolshevist propaganda in the United States with the connivance of Mexi cans and with the knowledge of Car ranza are said to be equalled by al leged evidence of Mexican I. \V. W. plots, pro-Gorman activity, suspicion directed at Japan and Mexico in the Magdalena Bay case, witli which the 1-os Angeles hearing will deal and tostlmony of Carranza's rabid anti Americanism. Following introduction of Senator J'all's resolution in congress lo seevr diplomatic relations with Mexico the herder today figuratively rang with rumors. That tlic marines would "go in and get Jenkins" and that the war department's plans for Invading Mex io were expected at headquarters here ioday so that preparations could be made were .products of the rumor factory. i-ITTLE ACTIVITY. The only visible unusual activity in the border army was arrival of a num ber of army automobile mechanics who atartod work of clearing out carbon in the motors of camouflaged tanks here. C'andido Aguilar, son-in-law of Car ranza, Is said to he in Spain pur chasing arms and ammunition. His activities are being closely watched by American secret service men. Ar rival of a Mexican munitions ship in gulf waters at a critieul time should relations reach the breaking point might mean another Vera Cruz issue. Non-interventionists, however, still hoped that President Wilson would block war; that the maneuvers of the X.rssldenttsl campaign in the United Btatea would postpone a Mexican war •t least until after 1920, or hoped that an "Iron man" would arise In Mexico to paclf' ; ' -Itably for America.

DEMOCRATS AND (Continued fiom page one.) ers deny they have this possibility In mind In delaying. Glass, in his annual report to con gress. declared the excess profits tax "encourages wasteful expenditure, puts a premium on over capitalisation and a penalty on brains discourages new ventures and confirms old ventures In their monopolies. He also puts upon it part of the blame for high prices. "I do not think the ways and means committee Is likely to follow this sug gestion." was Representative Green's r.nswer to Glass. Green, next to Chair man Fordney, Is ranking member of the committee. OBJECTIONABLE FEATURES "There are many objectionable fea tures connected with the excess profits tax. but the reduction in rates will riltlgate its application," Green contin ued. "It lias one merit that is often overlooked, namely that only those who are making a high profit pay It." To make up for the loss through abolition of the profits tax Glass sug rested a raise In the normal Income tax rate and a raise in the surtax rats on medium sized Incomes. To this. Green says: "It would be extremely difficult to obtain the amount produced by the excess profits tax from Incomes. It is well known that the multimillion aires are transferring their holdings to tax exempt securities. I think the e ,me result would follow if we under look to establish Intermediate rates u.i suggested by the secretary's re port." GERMAN CLAIM (Continued from Page One.) showed plainly that Reuter had re ceived communications from hit, gov ernment. Copies of von Reuter's sinking or der also were discovered In the Em den, the statement said. One of the communications now In possession of the admiralty is a letter dated May 9 from the chief of the German admiralty to von Reuter. This letter said the fate of the In terned German fleet would be decided at Versailles and that it wag the "duty of the German delegates to safeguard tlie ships and to arrive at a solution in accordance with German traditions and rights. The first condition is that the ships remain German. Their fate will not be decided without co operation. "Surrender to the enemy Is out of the question." Von Reuter's order for the sinking of the fleet was quoted In the admir alty statement as follows: "Commanding officers are ordered to make necessary arrangements for the sinking of ships. It should be en sured that each vessel sinks as rap idly as possible after receipt of the order." The vessels were to be sunk upon personal orders from von Reuter or in event the British tried to take for cible possession, the statement said. If the Germon government agreed to turn over the vessels to the allies then von Reuter said he would do so. Commodore Sinclair's statement pointed out that German ships ar rived at 8caps Flow on June 1". "Cu riously enough." he added, "It was on June 17 that von Reuter Issued his ! sinking orders." I Von Reuter still is interned St Don ington.
