PERSONAL CABD. A Matter In "Which the Puello Should Have a Deal of Interest To the readers of this paper. Why does the government spend so much money and risk so many lives in trying to capture the counterfeiter? "Suppose he does counterfeit gov­ ernment bonds and notes, surely the government is rich enough to stand any loss his act may confer!" But the individual citizen could ill afford to be put to continued financial loss if such desperados were let go un whipped of justice. It is only the valuable thing that is counterfeited it is only in the light of purity and virtue that impurity and vice can be known. No one in these days would counterfeit a Confederate bond or note. People who commit fraud always do it by simulating the highest virtue by preying on the cleanest reputation, by employing the fair name of virtue with which to give respectability to vice. Let us explain: Seven or eight years ago, so we have been informad many times in public prints, aNew York state gentleman was pronounced, as many millions have been pronounced before, incurably sick of an extreme disorder. By suggestions which he believed were providential, he was led to the use of a preparation'wtoich had been for sev­ eral years employed by a select few physicians in New York city, and one or two other prominent places. The result was that he was cured.he whom doctors without number nnd of con­ ceded ability said was incurable. Hav­ ing secured possession of the formula, absolutely and irrevocably, he deter­ mined to devote a portion of his ac­ cumulated wealth to the manufacture and sale of this remedy for the benefit of the many who suffer as he suffered, in apparent hopelessness. In less than three years,so tremendous became the demand for this remedy and soexalted the reputation, that he was obliged for his purpose to erect a laboratory and warehouse containing four and a quarter acres of flooring andlilled with the most approved chemical and ma n facturing devices. Probably there nev­ er was a remedy 1 hat lias won such a meritorious name, such extraordinary sales, and has accomplished so much good for the race. Unprincipled parties who flourish only upon the ruins of others, saw in this reputation and sale an opportu­ nity to reap a golden harvest, (not legitimately, not honorably) for which purpose they have made imitations and substitutions of it in every sec­ tion of the country, and many drug­ gists, who can make a larger profit on these imitation goods, often comprom­ ise their honor by forcing a sale upon the unposted customer. Yes undoubtedly the manufacturers could well alford to ignore such in­ stances of fraud so far as the effect upon themselves is concerned, for their remedies have a constant and unremit ting sale but they 'Jeel it to be their duty to warn the public against such imitations and substitutions non-secret and otherwise. The indi­ vidual who buys them and the public who countenances their sale alone suffer in mind, body and estate there­ for. The authors of some of these fraudu­ lent practices have been prosecuted and sent to prison for their crimes, but their is another class who claim to know the formula of this remedy and one Sunday ecool journal, we are told, has prostituted its high and holy calling so far as to advertise that for twenty-fivo cents it will send all new subscribers a transcript of the Warner formula! This formula, by the way, must be a wonderfuly kaleidoscopic affair, for there is hardly a month passes when some paper is not issued which pretends to give the only cor­ rect formula! The manufacturers inform us that they would be perfectly willing that the public should know what the true formula of Warner's Safe Cure is, (none that have been published are any­ thing like it), but even if every man, woman and child in the United States were as familiar with this formula as with their A C'a they could not compound the remedy. The method of manufacture is a secret. It is im­ possible to obtain the results that are wrought by this remedy if one does not nave the perfect skill acquir­ ed only by years of practice, for cora- pounding and assimilating the simple elements which enter into its compo­ sition. The learned Dr. Foster, the honored head of Clifton Springs sanitarium, once said that having roughly an* alyzed this remedy he recognized that the elements that compose it were simple but he attributed the secret of its power to the method of its com­ pounding, and this method no one knows except the manufacturers and no one can acquire it. Our advice to our readers, therefore, cannot bo to strongly emphasized. As you would prefer virtue to vice, gold to droes, physical happiness to physical misery, shun the imitator aful refuse thereby to lend yonr aid financially to those who seek to get, by trading upon another's refutation and honesty, a sale for wares and goods which on their merits are fit only to be rejected as the veriest re­ fuse. You can neither afford to pat­ ronize such people nor can you afford to take their injurious compounds in­ to your system. When you call for Warner's Safe Cure see that the wrap­ per is black with white letters and that the wrapper and label bear an imprint of an iron safe, the trade mark, and that a safe is blown in the back of the bottle and that a perfect lc prommisory note stamp is over the cork. You can't be imposed on if you observe these cautions. We have the highest respect for the remedy we have mentioned and the highest regard for the manufactures, and we cannot to highly commend their dignified and considerate tone in relation to those who would traduce their fair name and ruin the best in­ terest of the publifc in such matters. Athlophoros always gives me relief from rheumatism, and I am not troubled again with the complaint for months. A little exposure bringB it back again, but not as severely as before using your remedy.

It is an astonishing thing to observe the style which New York men are oc­ casionally able to put on by dint ol stretching out an income which is ab­ surdly small. Smallclerks, with sal­ aries of twelve, dollars a week, pay seven dollars of it for their board, two dollars for their washing, at least two dollars for their car f&res and luncheons, and yet manage to wear fashionable clothes. Some of these well-dressed but impecunious young men possess an amount of in­ formation about clothes, boots, hats, and the like that astonishes men who devote their time and thinking to graver things, and even equals that of the feminine dresser. They will go five miles up town and patronize a little shoemaker in aside street, because he is cheap and has the nack of pasting a paten on a shoe with such cleverness that itisscacely visible. Most of them have very old suits of clothes, which they put on as soon as they arrive down town, and they all shave them­ selves, black their own boofts, smoke cigarettes, go through no end of de­ privations and endure heart-rending miseries that they may be able to go with girls in the best society. Lots of fun is made of them, but, after all, they may be right, for dress has a great deal to do with a man's success in New York. Business men like to be surrounded by fashion­ ably clad and prosperous-looking clerks, and the knowledge that he is wearing good clothes always imparts a certain amount of confidence to the wearer. The merchant tailors along Broadway and the better avenues brag principally of the. fit they give their customers in return for a rather liberal expenditure of money. It does not do to go to a halfway tailor. Even though he succeeds in fitting you, there is sure to be a common look about the clothes. An ordinary suit, with a cut-away coat, made at any one of the hundred or two Broad­ way tailors, will cost from fifty to sixty dollars, and will look common­ place but durable. A similar suit bought of a.-swell concern, would cost sevonty-fivedollars.bui.it would be distinctively fashionable in cut, and have that peculiar air of distinction which goes to make a fashionable tailoi's fortune.—New York Corres­ pondent Cincinnati Enquirer.

If any doubt existed in this section as to the genuine fairness of the Lousiana State Lottery in making its monthly and semi­ annual distribution of prizes, that doubt was dispelled Saturday night. A letter re­ ceived from a Cincinnati merchant in which the following postscript was added: "I nee your town has again drawn capital prize in Louisiana Lottery," was sufficient to set our "city on the hills" in a blaze of ex­ citement. An indescribable hunt for ticket holders ensued. Pocket-books, day-books, desks, safes, trunks, valises, satchels, every­ thing was rummaged and tickets brought forth. For a time,suspense prevailed, and then the discovery was made that only one list had been received at the postoflice, ad­ dressed to S. H. Bettys. Mr. Bettys and J. M. McDowell formed a partnership some time ago in the purchase of tickets, agreeing to divide profits, if any accrued. Mounting ahorse bright and early Sunday morning, McDowell went out three miles in the coun­ try to «ee Bettys, and returning to town, Bettys' ticket and the number on the list, (46,799) corresponded. Going home in the western suburbs of Olivet, they were soon called on by the Tribune man, who wished to learn the particulars. Examining the ticket and list, we assured the parties that they were each $7,500 richer th^n thf.y were previous to their last investment in the Louisiana State Lottery. The parties went to Marsville Monday morning, and deposited their ticket foi collection with Pearce, Wallingford & Co., of the State National Bank, tho leading bankers ol Northern Kentucky and South­ ern Ohio, and in a few days will receive a check for their money. Mr. Bettys informed u* that he had been holding a ticket regularly in the Louisiana State Lottery for four or five years, with the exception ot a few monthly drawings, and he would have invested in them if he had had the money to spare. "I missed last September drawing with much reluc­ tance," said he, "but-I bad very urgent need of the dollar. I always recognized that the chance of drawing the capital prito was meagre, but felt my chances were as good as anybody else's. My faith is rewarded after long years of deprivations by receiv­ ing a sufficiency of money which, if judi­ ciously invested, will keep me in comfort­ able circumstances the remainder of .my days." He has been a teacher in the pub­ lic schools of Robertson since the organisa­ tion of the county, at a salary ranging from $20 to $40.per month. Many are the'eon gratulations he 1b reewving on his streak, of good fortune. Since Montgomery drew $15,000 in April. 1884, and even since Bettys and McDowell drew a similar amount in this inoiijk'i drawing, we have received numerousletrors from persons in several states and terri­ tories inquiring if the drawings were^genu­ ine. In every instance we have taken, pains to answer these- questions in the affirma­ tive, and we again repeat through the col ums of the Tribnne that these prises were actually drawn by the parties mentioned. Montgomery purchased a form near Mjb. !?r tk® of bis brother*, paying $3,000 therefor, and bought himself afarm within one mile of Mt. 8&rUng for which he paid $0,500. Minor prises, amounting in aggregate to $1,900 or over, have beep also drawn here, the largest of these prwes being drawn by M. D. Ellis andNim rod Camber, the former drawing $150 and the latter $70.

Postmaster Gqneral Vilas hails from Madison, Wis., and tbat extremely pretty city is very proud ot her handsome and eloquent cabinet officer, who, at the time he was chosen by President Cleveland as one of bis advisers, represented her in the Wisconsin legislature. Madison is also proud because she is ths State Capital and possesses a very imposing Capitol building standing in a lovely park. Then Madison may' also be proud of Wisconsin Univer sity, with its hundreds of students and able faculty of the Soldiers' Orphans' Homo, of the State Lunatic Asylum build­ ings, and of the many industries which go to make up the prosperity of the thriving little capital. All these institutions have grown up since 1836, at which time Madi­ son was in the wilderness. Pushing and intelligent citizens have mado her what she is, and it is pleasant to observe that Madi­ son still possesses a very large proportion of clear-headed men and women, who ap­ preciate a good thing when they see it and are glad to make its merits known. One of this class of citizens is L. A.

Mr. Rogers has this to Bay of how be was cured of a long-standing complaint: "I suffered with rhumatism for some time, so that it was with great pain that I could move around at all, and I also spent many uleeplesR nights. I am glad to »ay that after using two bottles of Athlo­ phoros I am entirely free from pain. No one need suffer from rheumatism if they will give it a fair trial." George W. Huntly, a dealer in groceries at No. 66 Pinckney street, and a leading merchant and old resident, commends the medicine as follows: "I have used Athlophoros for rheuma­ tism and can most cheerfully say with the most satisfactory results." "Mary I. Whiting, of No. 810 University avenue, who has lived iu Madison for thir­ ty years and is known and respected by every one, 6ays: '"I have been a victim of severe rheuma­ tism for the past three years, and having tried almost every remedy known without any avail, I was much discouraged. Last winter I was afflicted much worse than ever and was induced to try Athlophoros. I am glad to state tliatl am now free from pain and I pronounce the medicine a God­ send for the afflicted." To those words of commendation may be added those of Mr. T. R. Lutzow, a well known citizen who Bays of Athlo­ phoros: •'My wife was seriously afflicted with rheumatism, principally in her arms, fehe has now used two bottles of Athlophoros und is well and free from pain. I car cheer­ fully recommend the remedy to my friends and the public as being all that it claims to be." William Soinmers, foreman for B. F. McMillan & Bro., of McMillan, Wis., says tliat seven bottles of Athlophoros relieved him entirely of rheumatism of five years stft ndin^j, which was so acute at times as to compel him to give up work.
