Tho President of tho constitutional convention, Mr. Meredith, we ore pleaded to see, has constituted tha committees with a degred of fairnws that may not suit some craxy parti sans in tho radical ranks. He has not ignored the democrats in the conven tion, and seems to bo conscious that there are over 300,000 democratic TO tens in this state, who are entittled to some consideration. A. G. Curiin has boon appointed as chairman of the committa on the Executive De partment. Public and Municipal Debt, CR. Buckalew. Private Cor porations, Geo. W. Woodward. Dec laration of Rights, Wo. Hopkins. Constitutional sanctions, J.?. Black, —all democrats. Mr. M'Allister is chairman of the committee on Suffrage, Election and Representation, also a good selection as we would sooner entrust tho affairs of that important commute into tha hands ofMr. M'Allister, than any oth er republican we know of in that body —he will discharge his duties free from partisan bias. Seargeant Bates, an American, is just uow making a fool of himself by a tramp, on foot, through Engiaud. bearing the American flag, having en tered into a bet with some one that he could perform such a feat without ba ing molested. We have no doubt he can, unless in his walk he comes acrose a son of John Bull, who is as big a fool as himself and who may wish to kick his backside. But whether Bates es cape a kicking or not, will not settle the question that England is not a tolerably free country, and if he ahouid be greetted with rotten and at some points be denied a bite of "am," or have an application of sole leather administered to his seat, it would only be accounted for on the score that John Bull became enraged more at the fool than at the flag he carried. Gen. Grant has lately done two things for which many radicals, who lately supported him, will curse him, and are already doing it, while the democrats give him credit. These are the appointment of Fairman, as post master of Philadelphia, instead of Tru man, who belongs to the ring and whom Cameron insisted on having ap pointed, but got snubbed ; the other is the promotion of that gallant sol dier, Gen. Hanckock, to the position made vacant by the death of Gen. Meade. President Grant had been treating Gen. Hancock very, very odeanly all along, and banished him to the re motest and most isolated frontiers oat of sheer spite, and contrary to the rules and usages which apply to a soldier of Gen. Hancock's rank. Gen. Han cock submitted to all this shabby treatment without a murmer. It is one of the little and discreditable things in the life of Gen. Grant which he now would gladly wipe out, and while the entire democratic press, and other right thinking men (ensured President Grant for his mean treat ment of Gen. Hancock, tbey give him credit for doing him what is simple justice now, and what was meanly de nied him during the last four years. We give credit where credit is due, and should President Grant lift him self above the past littleness of his na ture, and keep snubbing the Camerons, and thatjclass of thieving radicals, we shall praise him for it. Let's see how long he holds out in this course. Death of Horaee Greeley. We are pained to chronicle the death of Horace Greeley, which oc curred on last Friday evening. His death is a loss to the nation, and at the present stage of American politics, his death is to be regretted by every American citizen. The nation has sustained a lost —be occupied a posi tion, as editor-in-chief of one of the most influential journals in the coun try, which gave him an influence and an opportunity for good, that few oth ers, if any, can be found to fill, at prc-s ent. Mr. Greeiey may have had —did have —his fault* ;of these it does not now behoove us to speak ; but he had his good qualities and enough of them, to entitle him to the respect of all. He was honest, he was sincere, and he was fearless in the ad vocacy of what he thought was right. Nothing else can be said of J/orace Greeley, scan his life as you may covering the last thirty years, and this' is what can be said of too few of our great men, who are .time-servers and in whom selfishness and the desire to gain place and wealth is the controlling motive, and without any re gard as to the means by which they obtain these. In the present hour, when the government in its every branch is reeking with corruption, and when the constitution and law are violated with the greatest possible non concern, we believe that the nation sustains a loss in the death of Mr. Greeley, for he was enlisted is oppo sition to these abuses, and was dealing corruption and aaal-admistration the hardest blows they received, and his paper became a terror to the evil doers cf the radical party, of-which he had becu the fermost ehampiou, but j which he did not hesitate to Jash with A whip of scorpions when it so notorU ously forsook the path of duty. This 4 Mr, Greeley has been engaged in fori several year*, ami all honest men re gret that hi* life was not spared, that he might continue in the good work of seeking to purify the government and bring it back to the good old standard jof honesty which'once was it charac teristic. All accord to Mr. Greeley hon est y)of purpose, although many, and the democrats particularly, may have dif fered with him and thought hi it er ratic upon a oeitnin great i* le. He believed he was right—wo democrats believed he was wrong. That issue has passed—it was decided in favor of Jlfr. Greeley —let it be dead with him. But in the present, and as far as re | gard* the future of the government, he was right, he was democratic, and he had the honesty, the manliuee* and courage to say that the radical party, tho party of his own making, was wrong, and ho was among the bold est aud most powerful opponents of that wrong, aud bis stand did much to check abuses, and bad ho liv er! to continue in the battle for the right, its triumph would have been hasteued. Mr. Greeley was agenerou* hearted man ; he was possessed of tho noblest social qualities; ho was strictly tem perate iu all his habits. Of his uhili !ty as f. thinker and a writer, no need say nothing, his jmwers iu thek-o re spects are known. As a speaker he never was rated high, until the !u>t [campaigu —for want of opporiuuitv or because he never strove to show his powers in that line—but tho speeches he made during (he last presidential campaigu proved that in this respect he was a truly remarkable man a!*o. His speeches were all so clbarly to llie point ; so full of moaning aud good sound sense that none of his most bit ter opponents could pick n flaw iu them, a tribute which cannot bo paid to the addresses of any other presiden tial candidate who undertook to ad dress the public at the time of his candidacy. , But, us the life of Horace Greeley |is so familiar to all, we will not go to further length iu this article. Hor ace Greeley is dead—the nation sus ! tains a deep loss —Peace to his ash lea. Harry White the Blatherskite. The Pennsylvania Senate for quite a number of years has been pestered with a member, called General Harry White, of Indiana county, the same chap, who, during the war, was south, not to fight but to look, aud was cap tured by the rebs and held at Rich mond. He is the greatest success as a paper general wo know of—he never fought any, aud we are doubly sure he never died a bit for his couulry, or for any body—yet be is General Har ry White, and stands prominent among all the dunghill roosters about the capkol at Harrisburg. He is a great talker, likes to hear himself talk and imagins every-bodv else has the same liking, in which he is greatly mistaken —for ho is a disagreable talk er, and as an imitation of tho braying of an ass, bis speeches are a perfect success. He cau draw just as long, broad and disagreeable as that ani mal, only the ass has the advantage of him by knowing when to keep qui et. In the senate, he pokes his gab into every thing, and this propensity for gab has made him disagreeable to all his fellow members, for his deliv ery is disagreeable, and his talk has nothing in it—he is a perfect walking definition of the word "Blatherskite." Yet general Harry White stands at the bead of the capital roosters, and he may yet be governor—stranger things have happened. This Harry Blatherskite White, is a member of the constitutional con vention, to the disgust of every decent member of that body. True to his na ture, be brays into every thing that | comes up, and will, as he docs in the j senate, monopolize more pages upon j the record than any other three "talky" members in it. It is a pity there is not a provision 1 somewhere to make the aaphcaded | blatherskite subside, so that the con- j vention could get along wifhout the j annoyance. Ha is the noisiest empty tin-can that ever turned up, and tied to a dog's tail, the dog's death would be certain from fright. Wc hope gen eral Harry White, will let the conven tion go on without inflicting his dis agreeable talk continually upon that body upon every subject, to tho an-i noyauce and disgust of the rest of the members—none of whom is fond of bearing him. ♦ > The Proposed Official Oath. A few weeks previous to the meet ing of the constitutional convention, we favored, in these columns, a clause in the constitution by which all mem bers of the legislature should be re quired 00 taking the oath, to swear, that they will accept no bribe directly on indirectly, for any vote or action taken by them as such. We see that one of the members of that body has introduced a resolution to that effect j of which a Harrisburg paper says: The new oath for civil officers, pro posed to be incorporated in tlto amen ded Constitution, if'adopted, would revolutionize the usages and practices of political parties, and is the first rec ognition in the reform convention, that there are fraud aud corruption in politics. The oath compels the man who qualifies on going into a civil of fice, to swear or affirm that he paid no one to secure bim such an ofiice; that he gave no bribes of any kind to se cure his nomination, and that he is un der no promise to uny man or men, to shape his official course to meet their iadiwdu&l interests—in short the oath is to prevent .candidates for office to resort to any foul iacu; to secure such places. We repeat, iftheo&W) en forced, the occupation ofthe profession al politician is gone, or perjury become | as -common as pea-uuts. —Horace Greeley was 62 years of uge. His foaeraltook place on Wednesday 4th. The President's Message [ Cugr* luwt on Monday. Ptosi- . dent Grant's Message i* long and dry. Contains nothing now, and it is mostly , a nummary of the reports of the lu>ads ( of the different departments. The Pitts- ; burg /tat'# nrlicle upon it, embrace* a i fair idea of the document : ( The document urt* out in the titusl { w#,v of thank (\itncst to the Olver ol *lll Oo.nl, refers to the Boston and Chicsjj • ftiv*. notes how the f.coplo aru rallyina' under their mhfertunee and how free we . lur# been from war |elileiice end other o tlamilic*.

The question tctween thlacountry and Great Uritain in regard t<> the tUlwr ie* has be*n disputed of and legislation to carry out tho provisions of tho tr.-aiy are *.krd for. The bounda- i ry line w Ith the llrituh po*eion* reooives a passing notice, and an invitation is asked for the International Congress to hold iu next session in the United States. The Vienna exposition receives considerable; attention, as it deserves, and money andl two naval vessels to transport article', sol 1 as the United Statu* will bo properly rep-: resented is desired. Our affair* with Me*- j ten, Spain, and other foreign powers are alluded to with all of which we are upon the most friendly relations. Provision is urged for distressed seamen in foreign l countries, and theu come extracts fromi the reports of the secretaries of the various | departments, one of thein tho most iinpor-1 ant, tho Treasury, and in which Mr. Grant uow makes, or Mr. Bout wall has uiadej some very huge blunders in regard to the reduction of the debt. A* there may be some mistake in traas- j mitting the figures over the wires, w* deter J farther comment for the present Tiiei me;>age then re.'cf* to river and harbor! improvements, and favorable attention is' requested to suggestions of the Secretary of War in regatd to the appointment of eadels nud other matters. Some other questions and suggestions; how they; should bo met are spoken of. and tha abo lition of the franking privilege is rvceoni men Jeil. Then eoines the question of the Government taking posession of the tele- j graph lines. Grant is in favor of this—in I fact it is one of his pet schemes. It give* him considerable more power and some thirty, perhaps fifty thousand additional etficers to appoint, ail calculated to assist in centraliaatien. Whatever action is tak en he says he wants to be fair to the Gov ernment and to private parties conecrned. He says there is an alarming falling off in our carry ing trade, and thinks that an expenditure of $6,000,000 per annum for the next five years would help our mer chant marine. Should'nt wonder. Tho President inform* us that the dis bursements through the Departments of - Justice have somewhat increased and blame* it on the reckless and lawless men of the South. He much regrets the neces sity for the Enforcement Act, and hopes the cause for applying it may not be again' demanded.

The message closes with reference to Civil Service Reform In which the Presi-j dent confesses that Federal offices have been regarded too much as the reward of. political services, and promises to apply' tho rule* as he understands them, but we. hardly infer from this that he will appoint; any Democrats. It is needless to say that the document falls far behind what the country had a right to expect. It has nd comfort for the!

FRAXCISCO, Nov. 25.—The Chronicle of to-day exclusively prints a full expose of the diamond swindle, which has just been discovered to be one of the most gigantic frauds ever perpetrated on the public. The fields belong to the New York and San Francisco Diamond Company. They were discovered by J. F. Bar rv of Salt Lake. The claim, which is about fifty miles from Fort Bridges, in Summit county, Colorado, turns out to have been salted with stoues purchased in London six or eight months ago. Arnold and Slack, the men who lo cated tho claim, are said to have made one million out of the swindle. Near ly all the capitalists in San Francisco are out from 820,000 to 8100,000 each by the transaction. The directors held a meeting to-day ; and acknowledged that they had been {duped, but claim thatCaliiorninnsare ! not to blame. There is great excitement in this' city over the disclosure.^ A TRIAL OF 50 YEARS. The New York Observer has pass ed through the ordeal, and starts out anew on the second fifty years with a, larger list of readers nnd more numer- I ous friends than ever.

Hi* sleeplessness was known to become greatly worse, but for years he had '■tillered more or less from the same difficulty, and as is now clear suffi cient allowance had not been made for the intense strain U|M>II him through out the summer, especially during the Inst month of his wife's illneas, but it soon become evident that his strength was uneipial to the hard task to which he had set himself. He wrote ouly three or four careful articles, one of them half a column in length. Tbr most notable perhaps was that entitled "Conclusions, wherein he summed up his views of the canvass. Ali he wrote was less than thiae and a half 1 columns. At lust, on Tuesday, the 12th insL. ho abandoned the effort to visit the of fice regularly, aud scut for his family Physician. Effort was made to iuduoe aleep, but he grew steadily worse, uutil it became evi lent that his case was critical, Dr. George P. Choate and others were called in for consultation, and finally it was decided to take him to Dr. Choate's residence, two or three miles distaut from Mr. Greeley's owu couu try house, at Cbappaqua. Here he received unremitting attention from Dr. Choate, Dr. Brown, and Dr. He jquard. Dr. Brown aud others wvre called iu for consultation. The in ■omnia had developed into inflatna ; tion of the brain, aud uudcr this the ;venerated palimt rapidly sauk. At times he was delcrious ; at other timts as clear-headed as ever. He lost flesh and strength with startling rapidity, and iu a few days his speedy death forced itself into uuwilling recogni tion. it was not, however, uutil Thursday that his associates and fami ly brought themselves to admit it; even then they still clung to his faith in the vigor of his constitution. Ou Wednesday nigbt he failed very rapidly. Thursday moruiog and eve ning he was deemed somewhat easier, !during the uight h# slept very uneasy, 1 muttering occasionally aud frequent ||y raising his right hand. Toward*' morning he was more quiet, and be lt ween eight aud nine o'clock fell into ja nearly unconscious condition, which Icontiuued with some intervals through the day. He made an occasional ex clamation, but many of them in con-1 sequence of his extreme weakness and apparent inability to finish what h* begun were unintelligible. About noon,however, he said quite distinct ly, and with some force, "I know that my Redeemer livetb." During the 'day he recognized various people, bis daughter many times, the members of his household at Chappaqua, Mr. Jno. ( 'R. Stuart, aud Mr. Retd. On the whole he suffered little, and seemed to have no more thau ordinary restless ness which accompanies the last stage of disease. About half-past three he -aid distinctly, "It Is Done." And beyond briefest answers to questions ibis was his last utterance. His youngest daughter, Miss Gabrielle. was with him through Thursday eve ning. Throughout Friday the elder daughter, Miss Ida, was in constant ' attendance as she had been during the whole of his illneas and ofMts. Gree ley's before him. At ten minutes hefere seveu o'clock the watchers drew back in reverent stillness from the bedside. The great editor was gone in peace after so mauy •druggies in honor after to much oblo quy.

Mr. Greeley's Health Some of ike more malicious radical papers have asserted that Mr. Greeley had become iusanc. The Tribune of 28th, ult., puts the story to rest, as follows: {from The Tribune.) To relievo tho soyioty of Mr. Gree ley's many frieuds, who haye beep disturbed by untrue reports that be is an applicaut for admission to Bloom ingdale, or some other Asylum, and by other wild inventions, it is proper to repeat what The Tribune said, a ' week or more ago. He still suffers [ from nervous prostration, arising from almost total loss of sleep for a month 'or more, during and since nis wife's; illness. This finally affected the nerves of the. stomach, and its rejec tion of food still further weakened the system. What he needs is a re turn of appetite and .sloop, restoring tone to the systtyn ; and in tyotb these particulars there has been an improve ment this week.

The the others u-adily consented, uod all four clambered to the tup of a large rock about fiftjr feet above the glycer ine, aud rolling a stoue weighing about fifty pounds to the edge of the rock, Hill and Gallagher proposed to tumble it into the pit. l'erry said; the darned thing might strike tire aud blow the stuff up. llill, laughingly, said, "let her blow ; we'll have some fun anyway."

Workmen from the railroad hur ried to the scene, well knowing what had happened. They found Terry and Donnolly with their clothing ■tripped from their bodies, lying about two hundred feet from the scene of the explosion, groaning in agony. Donnolly' body was badly lacerated. His legs aud one arm were broken, his body was black and blue, and one eye WM gone. He was mortally wounded. Terrr was the least hurt and will probably recover. He is the only one left to givejan account of the afternoon. When the smoke had cleared away search was made for Hill aud Galla gher. Hill's body was blowu to atoms.

We found her commodious and comfortable, with a jolly lot of Englishmen on Itoard. j 'tine parti .was going down the Mediterra-j nean to llriuditi, on a sort of pleasure ex cursion, thence t> return aero** the conti- i •nent to England Another party hollow 1 eyed and sunken-cheeked Was going to search fur health In the salubrious aim us-j , idler* of Hifily.

The engine had scarcely been reversed until we were bescigcd by -cores of noisy,, clamoring boatmen, yell j ing at the top of their voices in e horrible mixture of bed French and worse Italian and striving with each other for the job off j taking us on shore. If we had not known > befoi ehaud that their intentions were peaceful and saw that they were unarmed, the savage looking beggar- might have given rise to visions of cannibalism, or at the very least, sf scalping. All manner of things had they for sate -oranges, cab bage*. rabbits, pigeons Ac. The ever-, lasting Jew was among the rest—selling ornament* made out or the lava of Etna, and I discovered that the universal Inrlti icharacteristic of knavery and running were not wenling to my Hicilian Isrcalite The discovery, however, cost me five 1 fCanrs. Palermo is said to contain I'JO,UJU,lllhab itants. It is fair outwardly, but a vile bole, within. The climate of Sicily is most genial. Bold, rugged mountain ranges form the boundary of the island on every side, but I ain told that beyond those craggy moun tain top* there are delightful valley* (•bounding in streams of limpta water,, .bright clear villages, with cbarminr little sequestered nooks that make Sicily a utoat desirable winter retreat for scores of inva lids from Northern Europe. A dapper, little Russian on board, with whom I had made a temporary acquaintance, had spent the previous winter on the island. 1L was moat extravagant in praise* of itiisaiubniy and health-giving atmosphere.

We remained at I'alerma a day. and then raised anchor and stood for Vwms on the opposite side of the island.

The old story about this passage., like a good many other thing* in this ■ world, when properly invi-irtigaiefl. turns , out to be a good deal of a humbug. There is no real whirlpool to make the passage dangerous : though it is said to be trouble some to small craft sometimes.

SLANDER. • (The following Is the conclusion of S'sl communication, which we- < ifewdml out last week.) KniToa ltai-n ma : -Centre llall wss s nourishing little town situated at the foot <>f Nltlanjr mountain In ono of the int beautiful snd fertile vallies of lVnn'a. ! The LewUbtirg Centre and Spruce Creek II It., passing through the valley j a mile ♦outb of the town which fora time hid fair to make Centre Hall the great metropolis of Centre county. Unfortunately Centre llall has met with her reverses and Just at , present j* very much In need of a thorough * leconstructing, from the fact that one man i> a* good as another and a great deal het ier. Just now wrangling, malice, haired, and scandal seems to ho the order of the day. Charity Is a stranger here now;; * harily Ihltiknth no evil, rejoiceth not in | iniquity and beareth all things. It take* no pleasure In hearing or talking of the fancied or real faults of others ; it says, let ill bitterness and evil speaking he pull away rom you with all malice. The most i malignant kind of evil speaking is invent-' mg the slander, but there Is not usecb dif-1 Terence between the great devil who, makes it and the little imps who circulate it Hays one, ! did not hear fatso witness sgainst *o and so, I only told what ! had heard. But how did you know It was nut false ? How seldom they who spread an evi! report take any pains to investigate it* truth, lie sure before you repeat a charge that it is true. Once uttered you cannot recall it He to whom you tell it tells oth ers. Before repealing an evil report we should ask doe* charity prompt ma ; am 1 seeking (he good of others ; but 1 will just tell my friend, at the same time enjoining •ecrecy on him. The causes of this evil 'peaking uf other* is various- sometimes I from eavv. The wise and the good are rendered less superior in the eyes of the werid when some evil Is Slid of them, then from hstred and revenge O, what a eowardly'uielhod of retaliation ! why; not stand up face to face with your enemy and tell him of his faults. How hypocrit ical it is t profess to be your friend to your £* ce and shooting the poisoned arrow of slander at you from behind your back. Sometimes this is done ibrough pride There is a secret, self-lau dation in finding fault* with other* the | scandal monger seem* to say. "How much belter 1 am than uiy neighbor. ' Home •etui to think there is a fixed amount of merit and praise in the world, and so the tnoiVthejr deprive others of itthe more they reserve for themselves, and declare how 'dreadfully they hare been shocked to boar such ai d such things. And say, O I am n> sorry to have to tell you so and so about so and s). But how alien beneath this mask there is tejoicing. Ttiere U positive satisfaction, there it an exultation ill con cealed at the inconsistent ic* and dis grace of an enemy or a rival of any one who has stood high in the estimation of other*. The evil speaker should bear in tniuJ Uial whether the person maligned be guilty or innocent the speaker condemns j himself as lacking that charity without which he is nothing. How many are ready to take the judge * chair and pronounce sentence, but let me say to all such, stop the trial till you send lor the accused and j hear what ne ha* to say. As greedy j vultures pouncing down upon a putrid! carcase, as filly fiies butting round a ►ticking dirt limp, all the po*sij>ers who with evident relish utter detraction or, iisten to it. "When men combine lohate and treat on ill. Must he return them good and love them still. But if his name and character they tear, And cruel malice too, too plain appear, And when be sorrow and afHiction knew* They try to add unto his cup of vow." In conclusion let me say to mv western friend* they have my heartfelt thanks for their kindness shown me while sojourning in their midst. And to ali contemplating a visit to the west, that they will never re gret it, is my honest conviction. A. S.
