the world which was postponed from Nov 1 15 lat owing to the sudden death of John Fleming manager of the National Sporting club came off tonight The National Sporting club was crowded Barry scaled a 104 pounds and Croot 9 i at 104 the betting favoring the former During the first ten rounds Barry did most of the scoring in a thorouchly scientific struggle Then Croot made a determined stand and at the 18th round ha almost equalized matters When the lth round opened Barry im mediately forced the work at a great pace and finished much stronger than his opponfnt In the 20th round Barry put in some excellent drives and with a cMihirc right hander on Croots jaw knocked him out when only 40 seconds remained to the stipulated limit Barry had just sufficient lead to have secured a verdict had the contest reach ed its full length but the decisive man ntr in which he finished his rival stamped him as a dangerous hitter Croot remained unconscious 8 long that medical assistance was called I v as

Glendinning Appoints Will I iam Iglfthcart t Till the Vacancy Condition of toe o k On Hand lore Applications For Appoint ments as Librarian and Assist ant The Pioneer Library association for I merly the Masonic has a very valuable I collection of 10000 or more volumes I but by reason oflack of public support and inadequate financial aid the institution tution has not kept pace with the times nor been able to fill the measure I of its usefulness The common under I standing has been that the municipal ity would fail hell to the books if it I would take them give them suitable I rooms for safe keeping and provide I means for their proper care Another condition that would be imposed is generally understood to be an implied pledge that taking the Pioneer asso ciations volumes as a nucleus a public library and free reading room would be established and that the library would be enlarged by the procurement of new bocks By virtue of legislative authority the municipality through its representatives the board of library demonstrate trustees is prepared to its good faith toward making the pro posed city library the institution that every person desires to see On Jan 1 next there will be about 1100 of funds from taxes available for the purposes intendedthat is I to give the Pioneer associations collection of books a new home provide for its support and to aCQuire additional volumes QUESTIONS OF TRANSFER Unless the Pioneer collection is trans ferred to the itys trustees and their successors in trust tha municipality will not have even a respectablelook ing nucleus of a library with which to nuceus commence business Whether the city becomes possessed of the coveted 10000 volumes by clear title and on equitable if not magnanimous terms depends upon the action of a minority of the stockholders of the Pioneer Library as sociation and the generosity of the landlords of the Board of Trade build ing which has provided a room and furnished light heat and janitor and elevator service for the library with out any compensation to date because the librarys funds have been inade quate to pay even the librarians sal ary I the citys trustees take the old library it will be after the closing of negotiations that will be eminently satisfactory to the taxpayers and pub lic generally The terms will be most advantageous to the municipality while not detrimental to the present owners of the library as measured by the greatest possible benefit to the pub lic and every citizen the shareholders of the Pioneer association Included This was the concensus of opinion ex pressed by the trustees at their meet ing in Mayor Glendinnings office es ter ay afternoon 

WHERE THE TITLE IS VESTED Major H C Hill of the committee appointed to confer with the repre sentatives of the Pioneer association reported tljat lie had interviewed Judge C W Bennett the president Mr Christophei Dioal cretary Mr C W Morse represcrthig a large por tion of the Masonic holdings of the associations shares and other inter assocatons ested persons All were favorable to the library project and the assurance was given that the bulk of the stock holders owning the library would con vey their hol < mrs to the city without monetary recompense However there are some Masonic lodges outside ofthe city that would probably want a consideration paid for I their shares of stock but the Sgures i asked vll likely be so reasonable that they would scarcely be considered inoro than nominal Some minority shareholders Major Hill reported were disposed to demand full value for their i stock computed on a basis or cost and assessnitns but he believed they v ould yield to the majority in consid I ering the new era of prosperity about to dan on the public library as a pr > IerJy maintained cru institution The major was assued by those i with whom he conferred that a fspt ink ci the stockholders will be culled in a few days probably on Satut day to take formal action on the proposi tion to soil all the stock to tie city for a nominal consideration However the deal probably could not be uloaed until the Masonic grand lodge meets I which will be about the middle of Jan ON ITS 

LAST LEGS j I I As to the library itself Major Hill stated that it would be a splendid ac quisition to the city as affording a foundation upon which to build How j eer niciny new books would be needed ito i to bring the institution up to date in a city such as Salt Lake The Pioneer I cty association members had afsefSid themselves and in sundry ways had endeavored to carry the library along but it seemed no longer possible to I I keep its i doors open unless the city I I took l it off their hands 1 I LANDLORDS WILL BE FAIR I j Referring to the matter of rent the I i major reported the landlords of the t Board of Trade building were not un favorable to the library project but I I they reminded the committee that no j rent had ever been paid by the asso j elation for the room occupied by the claton library and for light heat and other j service Long ago a lease had been ed drawn up but it was never executed i I While the owners of the building had not demanded any back rent they sug gested that some negotiations with the prospective new owners of the library en lines of an equitable settlement of the rent problem would be considered germane to the subject before taking the books away to a more suitable lo cation Major Hill anticipated no serious con fiict with the landlords but he con sidered that the trustees had a unique problem to solve before the library goes to the city He for one would favor making no move toward getting the library until nil questions of ownership and possible liens were worked out by the nthr side to the entire satisfaction of the trustees I A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT Mrs Dart anothar member of the committee reported on the general con dition of the books and tons of un bound magazines The books consid ering the number are up to the stand ard of many of the best selections I found in the leading public libraries of the country Some of the books are invaluable and others could not be duplicated now for much less than they cost when put on the shelves As i I rule the books ate In splendid condi tion considering thdir long term of i uc or lack of use although not a j little binding and rebiading would have to be one to make minyvolumes I Ci > mny ser vices hlo WILL CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS j The subject wns disposed of by au I I thoiizins the committee of which Mr George D Pypcr is also a member to oortirUc hh powci 1j ait 21 notia tos for the transfer o1 ti > K i neer I i library to the city on the lines l idl i I I cduci m the commifess ivpov L of cunN j < tifrrb friistirs and to bo oercyme j J The only absentee at the board meet Ing was Rev A L Hudson who ten I dered his si io7ugO one of the trustees on account of his contemplated departure from the city The resigna tion was placed in the hands of Mayor Glendinning who subsequently filed with the city recorder his notice of ap pointment of William Igleheart to fill the vacancy The notice of appoint ment and request for its confirmation will come up for consideration at this evenings session ot the city council SUNDRY PROCEEDINGS Several applications for appointment as librarian and assistant librarian were fed without reading for future consideration along with other applica tions tons The secretary made requisition fort few stationery supplies and the pur chase of the articles needed was au thorized Secretary Hill suggested that the board consider the advisability of se lecting an executivtrcommittee but ac tion on the subject was deferred The board adjourned to meet again I at the call of President Webber I THE

despairing view concerning our currency which the president presents While there are some improvements which I should like to see made I I g Wdbel let think we shall be able to get alone I if l we do not get any currency legislation and a the situation presents itself now it looks a if it might be impracti cable to secure legislation on the lines of the presidents recommendations The recommendations in regard to Cu ba are humane and considerate 

IMPRACTICABLE VIEWS DIPRACTIALE I Senator Smith Dem While some I of the presidents recommendations I with regard to the currency may be I well enough i must be evident to him 1 that at the present time they are im possible of enactment His reference I I to bonds is painfully suggestive of the i I inadequacy of the present tariff law I and while his policy in regard to Cuba seems more moderate I hardly think it is in line with the special order of the Republican oolcv Senator Allen PopI do hot care to enter upon a criticism of the presi dents utterance but will say that I ntSta th noahiS r fail to eec with i him on his three principal suggestions of policy 

SENATOR TELLER PLAIN Senator Teller Silver ReprI do not believe that any legislation will be enacted authorizing the retention of the greenback in the treasury until I somebody is willing to pay gold for them The radical advocates of the gold standard will not be willing to accept this suggestion nor will the silver ver men so far as I am informed favor this disposition of the financial question I may be that the admin istration will be willing to go on furth er to meet the demands of the so I called currency reformers but judging from the utterances of the secretary of uterancts I the treasury he will be willing to make further concessions I do not believe that the suggestion for the tying up of the greenbacks will meet the approval 1 of the people as such a course would inevitably result in great contraction of the currency Indeed it looks to me I a i the suggestions of the president would not be satisfactory to any great number of people of any party The president is certainly mistaken when he says that the government is obliged to redeem its obligations in gold 1 has been the policy of the administration to so redeem but there is no compul sion on this point 

DISGUISES HIS METHOD Senator Pettigrew Silver RepThe president proposes to retire the green backs and in doing so he tries to dis guise the method by which it is to be accomplished I Is plain that if the presidents plan is adopted no more greenbacks can be in circulation than there is gold In the treasury Thus the greenbacks virtually become gold cer tificates and will be Immediately re I tired 

STARTLING PROPOSITION Representative Walker Rep Mass chairman of the committee on bank ing and currency said as to the finan I r cial l features of the message I fear the message is not sufficiently specific and does not gf enough to relieve f g I the situation It does not recommend I that anything shall be done until the revenues exceed the expenditures of the government which may be many II months in the future and is far from I immediate action Secondly the rec ommendation that greenbacks be not I paid out exdept for Jn when so e re I deemed in gold if enacted into law would enable one man with 1OOOOM of the I of greenbacks demanding gold I treasury and by depositing the gold in I the bank for greenbacks and repeating the process 246 times to retire the I whole 346000000 in the time it voud take him to oscillate between the sub I treasur in New Vork and his confed erate foreign brokers TIe recommend i ation that banks be required to redtem I their notes in gold with no other pro I visions of law would cause every bank i in the country to surrender its circu I lation and what other agency would I keep the country on a gold basis SOUNDS APOLOGETIC I Representative Bland Demo Mo I Representatve iIo I the recognized free silver Democratic I leader said The presidents proposition to retire i the greenbacks by holding them in the I treasury except for gold deposits 1 means a contraction of the currency to the amount of the greenbacks so im 1 pounded His statement of the situa I tion as t international bimetallism will Inot be accepted in earnest by anybody 1 There are few serious international bi I metallists but among them I suppose the president may be classed as one i I The message on all subjects sounds apologetic and like an affidavit for continuance I Representative Cox Dem Tenn the I ranking Democratic member of the committee on banking and currency The message in regard to the cur rency in my judgment is an utter 1 failure I the policy advocated was i carried out into law i could only re i i suit in the contraction of the cur I 1 rency renc1IXCAN 

OPINION I I Clericals Paver STcJIinleys Position I Masses Want Belligerency City of Mexico Dec Mexican i pub I I lic opinion regarding President McKin j leys utterances on the Cuba j question I is that they will greatly strengthen the Sagasta government and enable it to I win friends in Spain for its reform pol I icy in the island The clerical party naturally regards the attitude of the I president as wise and prudent but the masses who favor Cuba would have I liked to belligerency accorded the insurgents as such a course would I have led eventually to similar action in Latin America Resident Cubans are I opposed to autonomy in Cuba and as I sert that the fight will go on and that the autonomists in the island arc a I feeble minority They utterly distrust the promises of Spain I The Mexican Herald says it was for j I tunate for the American colonies in the I 1 revolt against Great Britain that the i French king did not take the same i view of their belligerency as1 does the I president of the United States to the Cuban patriots cause I 

ENGLISH OPINION I I I McKinley Bsvissd a Specious Pra tent Per Gaining Time London Dec 7The Daily Tele f 1 i graph commenting editorially on i 1 President McKinleys message this I i mormning says > I It used to be Americas proud boast that she had no foreign policy Jung V ing from President McKinieys nu < + sage the new world is no more five from the burdens of diplomatic nego tiations than the old In a document of portentous length mostly intended for Spanish consumption President McKinley has devised a specious pretext for gaining time It contains passages that will I certainly wound Spains national sus ceptibilities The whole tone though meant to be conciliatory savors too much of the magistrate availing hiri self of the first offenders act to lu very acceptable at Madrid Spain may not be so thickskinned as we are to these delicate usages of Americas dip lomatic courtesy Moreover there are serious dangers of revolution in Spain and the indis creet adjectives President McKinly applied to General Weylers policy will not lessen the latters popularity Much depends upon the attitude of I congress If as our correspondent thinks the jingos acquiesce in the de cision of the executive and give the Spaniards a chance all may yet be well but recent experience d6es not make us oversanguine The Daily Mail says it is very seats factory that President McKinley coms out so strongly against the jingos The Daily Chronicle describes the message as weak and colorless com pared with the vigorous handling of public questions to which Mr Cleve land accustomed us It says The explanation of this is simple Mr Cleveland was in front of congress McKinley Is behind it The presidents comments on the currency issue art positively childlike in their simplicity The Times says Its tone of pat ronizing tolerance will make the mes sage not wholly agreeable to Spain 1 Probably the president calculates that if he can satisfy the jingos for a time with eloquent denunciations and warn ings he will find it easier to pursue a moderate policy Regarding his currency proposals it seems too probable that Mr McKinley still clings to the notion that somt thing may be done for silver So Ion as he follows that will o the wisp h can hardly be expected to attempt any thoroughgoing reform of the cur rency
