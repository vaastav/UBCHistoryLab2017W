Country is not a mere zone of ter ritory. The true country is the Ideal to which it gives birth; It is tho: thought of love, tho sense of com munion. which unites in one all sons of the terr tory.?JOSfiPil .MiAZ 2i.NI. No one has heard of the present Adamston adm.nistrat.on's being a brilliant succeso. There aro l.kely to bo some rad.cal changes out there with n about three more full moons. Some of the bridge approaches In the suburbs of the city are pro-' nounced Unsafe and at other bridges there s no protection tftj pedestrians, whatever. Those in' authority should look after these at once. -A Negotiations seem well under way for a street car line to N'orthrj view, it is hoped that they will be successful. That hustling suburban town a entitled to easy access '.q.i tho city and a street car line lo( Northvlew certainly would start that place to booming rapidly. Harassing Jurors. It Is reported that criminal court: jurors are bein? harassed by per-: sons who make it their particular business to reprimand jurors after verdicts have been returned. Those alleged busy-bodies have the r own Ideas as to what shoijld happen to men on trial, and if juries fail to! return verdicts conforming to such! IdeaB. the jurors are told by them I that they did not do their duty, i There ought to be some way to pro tect men from such insults, rep rimands and harass ng who are' commanded by the state to do jury J duty. They aro not there of their own free will as a usual th ng and most of them would prefer not to do jury duty. Why should they boj made victims of adverse criticism because their verdicts do not suit1 designers nnd meddlers? The practice is a peril to justlco as there-may be men on juries some^j t mes who thus flnd'ng themselves criticized by men who ought to know better nyty bo Influenced In later trials to act to some extent ar leaBt so *as to allay such further criticism. Especially, is this true in the trials of colored and fore gn-born persons. These busy-bod es engender class hatred. They should be given to understand that jurors aro an Important part of a court and that persons have no more moral right at leaBt to approach and reprove them for their verdicts thin such persons or anyone else would have to repri mand the trial judge because they differed from him as to hia sentences. Shopp ng nt Home. Tho duty to do Christmas shop ping early is not more imperative than to do Christmas shopping and all other kinds of shopping at home. If possible. Civic patriotism s d's credlted every time anyone runs away from Clarksburg to buy goods elsewhere. To do shopp ng at home Is a thing dictated also by self-lnterst: for there ia no form of bus ness or profess'onal life that is not indi rectly benefited by loyalty to local ?tores. The more goods home Merchants sell, the more work there is for every one whose pros perity depends upon the wealth, j the size and the activity of Clarks burg. Cnfted we stand, divided we fall. All for each and each for all Spend your money at homo and It "Will come back to you, rJiTa 'here any among ? us who1 tpeak of malting purchases In Pitts oni'g or S'ew York with pride? Then' let us admonish them that they should acknowledge such action re luctantly and with shame. Let them reflect bow such action would appear tp them Jf thoy were the home merchants discriminated aga'nst In this disloyal fashion. As a general rule, nothing can be obtained In the' shops of other cities that can not be obtained here. See what confl dence home merchants have shown j In provld ng these splend'd empori ums crammed with articles adapted to the most exacting taste and to the slenderest purBO. Do we not all owe them tribute of loyal sup port? , Anti-Trust Records. An append.* to President Taft's ; message to the Congress on the mt -trust subject is of more than ord nary importance as it is a con cise review of what the courts and various administrations have been and are do ng under the Sherman anti-trust law. Beginning with the administration of 'President Harr son, Presiden Taft shows that the department of justice brought seven suits under that law and won three. Durinp the second administration of Grover Cleveland the government prose cuted eight suits and won four. Un der MoKinley three suits were In stituted and two won. With the Roosevelt admin stration forty-four suits were instituted and the gov-; ernment obtained favorable action oa- twenty-three of them with sev eral pending. Thus far within the Taft adminis tration thirty-seven court actions have been brought under the Sher man anti-trust law. Many of them are of too recent date to be at the stage of decree in both the lower and higher courts, but there has been favorable action In eight or ten cases and combinations have beon dissolved In several Instances. Be sides 'n 'the neghborhood of $200, 000 in fines has been Imposed, the major portion of which has been col lected. In view pt this record, it is not a matter of truth to say that the trusts have not been vigorously prosecuted under the anti-trust law, especially during the adm n stra tions of former President Roosevelt and President Taft. Those who have any conception of court pro cedure at all muBt confess that the department of justice has been very busy and the success attained em phas zes the v'gorous manner em nloyed In breaking up combinations and monopolies. The anti-trust records of Roose velt and Taft are not to be desp'sei by any except those In sympathy with trusts and monopolies. Away Ahead. On the scorn of progressiveness' through the channel of an alert board [of trade, ClarkBburg has gono away "ahead of most West Virginia cities. The Dispatch-News at Parkersburs admits this in respcct to Parkers burg and refers to that city's pos tlon in the premises as a shame and a disgrace. The Parkersburg news paper also recognizes that there is much more to be gained through the united effort of a large number of business men of a community than through the efforts of only a' few and in th's both new and old members of the Clarksburg Board of Trade have cause for gratiflcat on and encouragement. Says the Dia pntch-News: The people o( Huntington, Charles ton. Clarksburg, Morgantown and Fairmont have rallied magnificently to the support of their chambers of commerce or boards of trado, hun dreds of business men in each town Joining just to help out with a membership fee. And yet, the board of commerce of Tarkersburg goes plodd'ng along with Icbs than ono hundred pay ng members, and doing as successful work for Par kersburg as any of these richer con temporaries have done or aro doing for their respective cities. It is a shnmo and a disgrace; the Parkeri burg board of commerce should have a membership of 1.000, and every application to belong should he accompanied by a chock for a year's dues. A Good Suggestion. A most commsndable suggestion has been made by prominent labor unionists In Pittsburg, 'Wheeling and elsewhere to distribute the re maining port on of the $190,001) contributed toward the defense of the confessed IMoN'amara dynamiters! among the w dows and orphans of; the men who were killed In the blowing up of the Los Angeles' Times. Such a course would help, In a great measure to lift the labor organizations of the coutnry out oil the plight nto which they hare: fallen, though Innocently, and aid ln; removing the stigma that has been! cast upon their operations. The Pittsburg Dispatch declares such a course would be humane, just and creditable, and comments thereon as'follows: It offers to the contributors, mis led by the most positive affirma tions of innocence and faith ill fel low unionists, an opportunity for the amende honorable. Having been deceived Into volunteering support where none. It Is now shown, was deserved, there could be no finer dis avowal of that error than to turn over the money so subscribed for the relief of the 'nnocent living vie tlms of the crime. >In no other way. j possibly, can they so convincingly Bet themselves right with public opinion, remove from unionism ?ho reproach cast upon it by the MoNamaras and disassociate them selves from the complications in which they have been deceitfully n j volved by the belief that they werr aas'stlng in protecting Innocence un j justly accused. Much of this money has no doubi been expended In the conduct of the, case, but whatever has not been j spent could not, we believe, be de ' voted to a cause ntore deserving or! more redounding to the credit of or- ? ganlzed labor than 'ts distribution; amdng the widows and orphans of the victims. -nnCH3OTOffl3?OOOOW?OOBB^ >CKMXH>0OOO?O0OCSSaB3)SC83??eM?0. "Mamma, what's a seal?" asked eight-year-old Mary, looking up from the paper, whose black headlines she was laboriously deciphering. "A seal Is a I'ttle animal that live? in the ocean. We use its fur for coats and wraps," was the enlightening an swer of the Trent. Mary puckered her brow for some minutes, and again interrogated. "Mamma, will seals stop plagues?" referring perhaps to some of the Biblical narratives Ehe had heard told ln Sunday school. "Stop plagues! Why, child, what are you talking about?" cried the mother in amazement. "Why here It says, 'Red Cross Seals Stop White Plague," triumph antly holding up the paper. Then mamma explained to her lit lie girl that the Red Cross Seal Is a tiny stamp-like sticker which Is placed on the hack of letters and packages coming from Santa Claus and others. Every seal costs a penny, and every penny gees to fight and cure consumption, which la the real name of the white plague, and which Is an awful sickness. Mamma told her of a little girl in their own neigh borhood who had consumption, but who was given a chance to get well because the people had bought Red Cross Seals. Mary listened attentively, and final iy touched by the closeness of the ap peal,. said, "Mamma. I think I'd ra&her have some of those seals than a now dolly."
