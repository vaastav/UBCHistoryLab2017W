THE TOPEKA DAILY STATE JOURNAL TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 3, 1918 SENATE IS SPLIT liesolutions Offered on Presi dent's Actions Up in the Air. , Another In Today Maying Mar shall the President. THIS BY SENATOR SHERMAN Some Feel It Unwise To Send ' Ah road a Committee. Hitchcock Advocates "Barring" Wilson From Acting President. j . Washington, Dec. 3. Senator Hitch cock, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee today advocated passage of a resolution declaring Pres ident Wilson "unable" to perform the duties of his office while abroad. v Hitchcock's attitude r;as a surprise to other Democrats. He explained it by saying: "My personal opinion is that the senate should do something to settle thd matter definitely, to say who is president. I believe the supreme court, if called on to rule on a reso lution declaring 'resident Wilson un able, by reason of his absence, to per form the functions of his office, would hold tjiat congress is the best judge Of the eafecMtive'a ability or inability function- In my opinic. on the matter I am at variance with most of the, Democrats.'' Discuss Resolution. Hitchcock announced that the for eign relations committee will meet this week to discuss the Cummins resolution creating a senate committee to attend the peace conference- The Sherman resolution to be introduced today, declaring the office of president vacant and seating Vice President Marshall for the remainder of the term, probably will go to the judiciary Committee. Hitchcock today called Jtha Sherman resolution "absurd." "I think t not probable that the Cummins resilution will be favor aWy;.rfP?rtis by the foreign relations fammitteeV said Hitchcock. "I do xrot betteve It will pass the senate. I have no disposition. however, to Km other it in committee. It should t given its fair chance in the senate. It- is likely, therefore, that this com mittee will report it without recom mendation. i'"Home senators feel that it would be unwise to send abroad a committee that, because of its unofficial position, WpuW be subject to snubs and which flight embarrass our peace delegates a-nd the senate. Others think that the supreme importance of having the annate take part, thru discussions here, pt peace terms contemporaneously Uhj the peaces-conference, warrants the sending of the committee." The Whole Senate. j Senator IMtt mean's amendment to end the whole senate to Paris will not receive serious consideration. The house judiciary committee probably will be in no hurry to meet rt the Kodenburg resolution substi tuting the vice president for the presl eVnti during th latter's absence, Chair man Webb indicated today. r -Hitchcock said that neither he nor tether Democratic leaders had devised 4 try plan as a substitute for the Cum mins resolution as a means of keeping Che senate informed of developments. believe the senate will have full ii.'formauon," he said. "The discus ilpns'here, I feel, will have consider able Influence abroad, as reflecting American public opinion on the ques tions under discussion." Must Keep Head. publican opposition to the Cum mins plan grew today. Senator Wat bn, leading Republican, declared "the senate must keep its head and do nothing to alienate the country." $ Other Republicans said they will vote against the Cummins resolution. The generally expressed Republican View of President Wilson's message " was that it was disappointing with re spect to filling the demand for further light on certain of the fourteen prin ciples of peace terms. Republicans said .they expected some definition of freedom of the seas, amplification of the leacue of nations man. and a state Ttyint of just .how the president ex . pects to impress-his views abroad. Replying to expressions. Senator Dew is, Democratic whip, said: t Already Kx plained Them. TVPreslden.t Wilson already has ex- Tiainen nm pPHy term: seems to

As to the freedom of the seas, there may be some vagueness, but that grows out of the fact that no satisfactory definition hus ever been evolved pn that point by any body. The president is pre- servine a wise measure or reticence, so as not to tell the enemy all he hopes to do nor how he hopes to do it. That would be poor strategy." On this point .senator Hitchcoca called attention to the fact that when the fourteen peace terms were first, enunciated "there was no adverse comment, but much that was favor able. The assumption rightly follows that the terms were accepted by the American people aa an expression of their views and so long as President Wilson stuys within those fourteen terms, T don't see thnt he will be do ing anything extraordinary."

HARD TO SETTLE Says Congress of the Railroad Question as It Stands. May Reach. So Agreement at the Session Opening. GALL FOR INVESTIGATION Cannot Let Roads Go Bark on Their Pre-War Basis. But Congressmen Do "ot Know What They Will Do. Washington, Dec. 3. Settlement of the railroad problem at this session of ! congress will be practically impos I sible, leaders of both houses declare today- They based the assertion upon pi hurried survey of the situation, fol : lowing President Wilson's request in his message that congress immediately evolve a plan of railroad control, which will eliminate evils that existed when the government took the lines as a war measure. Senators Smith, South Carolina: Un derwood, Alabama; Cummins. Iowa; and Representatives Esch and Kims; members of the interstate commerce committees df the two houses, con curred in this view. They and prac tically all other members of congress agreed heartily with the president's assertion that the roads cannot be turned back under pre-war conditions. As to the degree of modification, the views rangea irom complete govern ment ownership, and operation to slighf changes in existing laws. Xo Plan in Mind. Senator Smith and Representative Sims, chairmen of the two committees, both stated they have no plan in mind for attacking'the problem which the president puts squarely up to congress. Within a short time they will call meetings of their respective commit tees to outline the speediest way of dealing with the matter, in view of the president's intimation that undue de lay by congress will lead him to turn the railroads back just as he took them. "It is my clear impression that the president intends, if there is no legis lation in the near future to restore the railroads to their owners," said Senator Underwood. "It is a physi cal impossibility for there to be any legislation at the present session. It therefore,- seems obvious to me that the president's attitude will result in throwing this problem into the lap of the new congress which the Republi cans will control." Approacli It Openly. Senator Cummins, who after March 4, succeeds Senator Smith as chair man of the interstate commerce com mittee, said congress should "ap proach the question with open minds ready to hear all that is to be said and willing to view it from every 'standpoint and then decide without fear, favor or prejudice. This does not mean that members snouia dis card their convictions, but it does mean that we must hold our Judg ment subject to the change which in vestigation, argument and reason may require." Cummins urged immediate opening of a painstaking investigation upon which to base action. He is generally regarded as favoring public owner ship. Representative Ksch, who on March 4, becomes chairman of the house committee said: Make an Investigation. "The railroad investigation should be made by the joint committee for merly headed by Senator Newlands. It is the only body I know of which has even made a start on an investiga tion along the required lines. Its life ends January 1, but it could, be ex tended." Ksch is a member of this commit tee, which already has gathered more than 7,000 pages of testimony regard ing railroad operation. "I do not believe," he continued, "that the federal government should retain any powers such -as it now has, such as ordering Interchange of ser vice, distribution of equipment and rerouting by shortest routes."

MARTIN IS BACK Kansas Military Leader a Passenger on Rcturnlns Ship. New York. Dec. S. Brig-. Gen. Chas. I. Martin was a passenger on the troop ship Northern Pacific, which arrived at Hoboken. Monday, carrying- 1,000 wounded soldiers. Brig. Gen. Charles I. Martin's re turn to Kansas was indicated several weeks ago in a dispatch announcing mat several ongaaier generate naa been reduced to ranks of colonel and command units materially changed. General Martin's name appeared on the list. It was assumed by men in army circles that the well known Kan san would probably return at an early date. General Martin won his first mili tary recognition in the Spanish-Ameri can war. where he served as an off! cer in the famous fighting Twentieth Kansas. He was made adjutant gen eral by Governor Stubbs in 1 9 10, having previously served four ears tia oLtiuo t-iiu.i.t'r 1 1 u in Kuyruuii utili ty. General Martin was reappointed by Governor Hodges, Democrat, and by Governor Capper, Republican. In 1116, General Martin went with the national guard to the Mexican border. When the guard organizations were federalized in 1917. the Kansas com mander was commissioned a brigadier general and last spring accompanied the troops to France after more than six months training at Camp Doni phan. General Martin was in com mand of the Sixtieth brigade compos ed of the 139th and 140th infantry. BAVARIA IS CHANGING Kurt Isnrr, Premier, Losing and Ac- j tion for Monarchy Is Expected, j London, Dec. 3. Kurt Eisner, the Bavarian premier, is losing prestige, according to a Danish advice received here by the way of Amsterdam, Cop enhagen and Berne. A Copenhagen dispatch says that Eisner was hissed oy his own partisans at Munich dur ing a celebration in honor of return ing soldiers. Later a supporter of Eisner was not allowed to make a speech and was obliged to flee from an angry crowd which removed the red flags along the streets and storm ed the ministry of the interior, shout ing: "Down with Eisner. Guards fired over the heads of the crowd, which dispersed. A Berne dispatch to the Mail says it is believed that "Bavaria is gradually reaching a conclusion to retain its unity with the rest of Ger many rather than seeking a separate peace." This message also reports evi dences of growing hostility toward Eisner, adding that there are signs in Munich that a crisis is approachina and that action favoring some form of monarchy may be taken within three weeks. BOCHE WILL BE SLOW May Not Be Abro To Give Vp 5,000 lioeomotives by Teeember 21. Paris, Dec 3. It appears the Ger mans will he unable to hand over all the 5,000 locomotives-stipulated in the armistice agreement by December 21 according to the Matin and it is pos sible that the allies will grant more time to the enemy. This will have the effect of delaying peace negotiations since they cannot begin until the armistice conditions have all been ful filled. Discussions among the allied dele gations to the peace conference will probably begin' on December 20 with President Wilson taking part person ally.

Price Regulation Thru Illegal Combination, Was Stated. Washington, Dec 3. Congressional action to control the meat packers to day promised to result from the fed eral trade commission's charges of illegal combination and price regula tion In the trade. - A conference of senators, including Kenyon, Iowa, and Borah, Idaho, will be- held soon to outline some course of action to correct evils the trade commission's two reports declare exist. The problem facing those who want action is how to retain the undoubted utility of the meat industry machinery without giving the firms mentioned by the trade commission power to abso lutely control meat supplies and processes. The flat charges that the packers Armour. Swift, Morris, Cudahy and Wilson now exercise this power thru I a gigantic and close combination Is made by the commission in a report submitted to congress yesterday. The trade commission's conclusions as drawn from several hundred pages of evidence are in the main: That the five companies have di vided up the country for their opera tions in such a way as to allow them to absolutely control both buying and selling prices. ' That the companies exchange con fidential information. That the companies act cojluslvely in buying and selling. That Swift, Armour, Wilson and Morris have combined to control the South American cattle .market. That all contribute to a Joint fund to swing public opinion. The "black; book" figures promi nently in the report. This book con tains the notes of various packers' meetings and .was the property of Ger mon S. Su!rberger of Sulzberger & Sons, the report states. One of the practices of the pack ers to control prices of cattle, the re port said, was to wire ahead when a seller wag-not satisfied with the price originally offered by one packer ana was on his way to another. When the seller reached the second buyer he was offered the same price as the first offered. GOULD STOP REDS So Says Baron Aexkuell, After Fleeing From Esthonia. L Few Cruisers Could Put an End to Murder and Plunder. (By tbe Associated Press) Berlin, Monday, Dec 2 (delayed).' If a few British torpedo boats or light cruisers, with even a small landing force could reach Keval this week. they could dam the Bolshevist flood which f has been murdering, burning anu plundering Esthonia and Lavonia, according to a declaration made to the correspondent by Baron Aexkuell of Esthonia, who escaped from that country on Thursday in disguise. Baron Aexkuell reports that Ger maa forces had begun to evacuate Narva when they were attacked and defeated by Russian troops. Last Tuesday, white guards eom matided by former Russian officers under the leadership of Count Keller, of the Old Russian regime,, were at tacked by a superior Bolshevist force. The guards gave protection a month ago to 51)0 Russians who alleged they had deserted from the Bolshevist army because of bad treatment. They brought twenty-three machine guns with them. "While the attack was pro ceeding last Tuesday, these Russians fired upon the white guards from the rear, contributing materially to their defeat. The white guards, half an nihilated, retired. Esthonian workmen are nearly all Bolshevists, according to Baron Aexkuell. and the middle classes of Esthonia and Iavonia are facing the same reign of terror that the bourgeoisie of Russia have suffered.
