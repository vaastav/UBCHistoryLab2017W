PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. THE FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT ARTHUR To t/u Member* of the Sc mitt (•/id House of Representative*: An appalling calamity has befallen the American people since their chosen Rep resentatives last met in the halls where ; you are now assembled. Wc else recall, with unaltered content, the rare prosperity with which, throughout the year, the nation has been blessed. Its harvests have been plente ous, its various industries have thriven, the health of its people has been pre served, it has maintained with foreign j governments the undisturbed relations of amity and peace. For these manifesta- l dons of 11 is favor we owe to Him who i holds our destiny in 11 is hands I lie tri bute of our grateful devotion. To that mysterious exercise of His will, which has taken from us the loved ami illustrious citizen who was but lately the head of the Nation, we bow iu sor row and submission. The memory of his character, of his noble achievements and of his patriotic life, will be treasured forever as a sacred possession of the whole people. The announcement of his death drew from foreign governments and peoples tributes of sympathy and sorrow which history will record as signal tokens o( the kinship of nations and the federation of mankind. 1 OUR 

RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN. The feeling of good-will between our i own Government and iliat of Great Bri- j tain was never more marked than at present. In recognition of this pleasing | fact I directed on the occasion of the late ! Centennial Celebration at Yorktown that a salute be given the British flag. Save for the correspondence, to which I shall refer hereafter in relation to the proposed i canal across the Isthmus ot Panama, lit- ! tie has occurred worthy of mention in . the diplomatic relations of the countries. 1 Early in the year the Fortune Bay claims i were satisfactorily settled by the British j Government paying in full the sum of 1 £15.000, most of which lias been already distributed. As the terms of the settle- i ment included compensation for injuries j suffered by our fishermen at Aspy Bay, ■ there has been retained from the gross ; award a sum which is deemed adequate ( for those claims. The participation of Americans iu the exhibitions at Melbourne ami Sydney will I be approvingly mentioned in the reports j of the two exhibitions soon to be pro- , sented to Congress. They will disclose | the readiness of our countrymen to make ! successful competition in distant, fields of enterprise. The surrender of Sitting Bull and his forces upon the Canada frontier has allayed apprehension,although bodies of British Indians still cross the border in quest of sustenance. Upon this sub ject a correspondence has been opened, which promises an adequate understand ing. Our troops have orders to avoid, | meanwhile, all collisions with alien In- i dians. THE INTER-OCEANIC CANAL. The questions growing out of the pro- i posed inter-oceanic water way across the j Isthmus of Panama are of grave national : importance. This Government has not j been unmindful of the solemn obligations i imposed upon it by its compact of 1849 with Colombia as the independent and j sovereign mistress of the territory crossed ! by the canal, and has sought to render them effective by fresh engagements with the Colombian Republic looking to their practical execution. The negotiations to this end. after they had reached what appeared to be a mutually satisfactory solution here were met in Colombia by a disavowal of the powers which its envoy had assumed ami by a proposal for re newed negotiation on a modified basis. ' Meanwhile this Government learned j that Colombia had proposed to the Euro- , I pean Powers to join in a guarantee of | the neutrality of the proposed Panama I Canal, a guarantee which would be in | direct contravention of our obligation as ; the sole guaranty of the integrity of Co i lombian territory and of the neutrality j of the canal itself. Foreseeing the probable reliance of the ! I British Government on the provisions of: j the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850 as j affording room for a share in the guaran tees which the United States covenanted with Colombia four years before, i have not hesitated to supplement the action of my predecessor by proposing to Her Majesty’s Government the modification i of that instrument, and the abrogation j of such clauses thereof as do not com port with the obligations of the United | States toward Columbia or with tho vital needs of the two friendly parties to the ! j compact. SOUTH AMERICA AND OTHER NATIONS. Special envoys have been sent to Chili. Bolivia and Peru, in order, if possible, to 1 bring about friendly relations between j j these governments. | An honorable adjustment of affairs be i tweet: Venzuela and France, through the j 1 interposition of the United States, is j speedily looked for. The recent treaties with China are ini full force, and the relations between the two governments very friendly. The intimacy between this country and ! Japan, the most advanced of the Eastern nations, continues to be cordial. The Emperor contemplates the establishment > of full constitutional government, and he lias already sujnuioued a parliament ary congress for the purpose of effecting : the change. * THE NATIONAL FINANCES. The report of the Secretary of the j Treasury presents in detail a highly i satisfactory exhibit of the state of the i finances, and the condition of the vari- : ous branches of the public service admin istered by that department. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the filial year ending June 30, 1881, were: From customs, $108,159,(17(5.02: from internal revenue, $135,2(52.385.51: from sales of public land*, $2,301,8(5-5.17: from tax on circulation and depoitfi of national banks, $8.11(5,115.12; from re payment of interest by Pacific Railway Companies. $810,883.80; from Sinking Fund for Pacific Railway Companies, customs fees, fine*, penalties, *Ac., sl,- 225,514.50; from fees, consular letters, patents and lands, $2,244.9*3.99: from proceeds of sales of Government property j $262,144.00: from profits on coinage, $3.- j 405.455.fi1: from revenues of the District of Columbia, S2.OK>. 199.2:5: from miscel laneous sources $15.20(5.880.13.

Total ordinary expendi tures. $200.7 59. Leaving a sur plus of revenue of 404.95, which was applied as follows: To ike .redemp tion of bonds for the sinking funl, 371.290.00: fractional currency for the i sinking fund. $109,001.05.

The sum of $74,480,201.05 was j t applied to this fund, which left a deficit ; j of $10,307).55JU.47- The increase of the , ; revenues for J.*Bs over those of the pre -1 vions yea r was $29.352.1/9f . J 0. It is estimated that the rouidpts dur- I ing tho present fiscal year wili i£;udi , ; $409,000,000, and the expenditures $270,- j 000.000, leaving a surplus of $130,000,000 j 1 applicable to the sinking fund and the j ffeifomption of the public debt. 1 ap -1 proven t*ie recommendation of the Sec | rotary of tu% Treasury, that provision be j made for the eat %y yeti re ment of silver 1 certificates, and that z, n t requiring i their issue be repealed. They wjjre is sued in pursuance of the policy of iie Government to maintain silver at or near ! the gold cfondard. and were accordingly made icceryabtu for all customs, taxes, | and public dues. About sixty-six mill ions of them are now outstanding. They form an unnecessary addition to Hu: per currency, a suflicicnt amount of which • may be readily supplied by the national j banks. THE 

COIN AGE OF SILVER DOLLARS. In accordance with tlie act of Februa- j *ry 28, 1878, the Treasury Department lias monthly caused at least two millions I iu value of silver builliou to be coined ! into standard silver dollars. One hundred ami two million of these dollars have been already coined: while only about thirty-four millions are in circulation. For the reason which he specifies, 1 concur in the Secretary's recommenda tion that the provision for coinage of a i fixed amount each month be repealed. ! and that hereafter only so much be coin ed as shall be necessary to supply the 1 demand. The Secretary advises that the j issue of gold certificates should not for the present be resumed, ami suggests that the national banks may properly be forbidden by law to retire their currency except upon reasonable notice of their intention .so to do. Such legislation ! would seem to be justified by the recent • action of certain banks on the occasion ! referred to in the Secretary's report. 

REFUNDING THE BONDED DEBT. In tho iast annual report of the Score- j tary of the Treasury the attention of j j Uongrcss was called to the fact that 1 j $409.(551.050 in five per centum bonds j and $203,573,750 in six per cent bonds would become redeemable during the year, and Uongress was asked io an- | thorize the refunding of these bonds at a low'd* rate of interest. The bill for | such refunding having failed to become a law the Secretary of the Treasury, in April last, notified the holders of tin* $195,(500.400 six per centum bonds then outstanding that the bonds would Ik* paid at par on the first day of July fob; ! lowing, or that they might be “contin ued," at tho pleasure of the Government, j to bear interest at the rate of three and i 1 one-half per centum per annum. Under I this notice $178,055,150 of the six per 1 centum bonds were continued at the low | rate, and $17,035,250 were redeemed. In the month of May, a like notice was given respecting the redemption or continuance of the $439,841,350 of five \ j per centum bonds outstanding, and of. ; these. $401,504,900 were continued ui | ; three and one-half per centum per an t nuin. and $38,33(5.450 redeemed. Tin; 1 (I per centum bonds of the loan of Feb | ruary 8. 1801. and of llie Oregon war debt, amounting together to >l-1.123.890 1 having matured /luring the year, the | j Secretary of the Treasury gave notice of i his intention to redeem the same, and | such as have been presented have been ! paid from the surplus revenues. There i i have also been redeemed at par, $1(5.179.- i 190 of the 3V per centum continued bonds. , , making a total of bonds redeemed, or 1 • ! which have ceased to bear interest, dui ! ing the year of 123,909.550. The redne ; lion of the annual interest on the public ! i debt through these transactions is as fob j lows; By reduction of interest to three and one-half per cent... $10,478,952.25; j by redemption of bonds, $0,352,3 hi; j*o tal. $1(5.82(5.292 25. The three and one- 1 half per centum bonds, being payable at the pleasure of the Government, are available for the investment of surplus revenue without the payment of premi ums. Unless these bonds can be funded I at a much lower rate of interest than ! they now bear, I agree with the Soereta ! ry of the Treasury that no legislation i respecting them is desirable. REDUCING THE REV I N! E. | It is a matter for congratuinatiou that j the business of the century has been so j prosperous during the past year as to • yield by taxation a large surplus of Sn i come to the Govern ment. If the reve i line laws remain unchanged this surplus must, year by year, increase, on account i of the reduction of the public debt ami : its burden of interest, and because of tho rapid increase of our population. In | 1800. just prior to the institution of our internal revenue system, our population but slightly exceeded 30.009,009. By II the census of I*Bo it is now found to exceed 50,000,000. It is estimated that. ; even if the annual receipts and expendi tures should continue as at present, the entire debt could be paid in ten years.— In view however, of the heavy load of j taxation which our people have already borne, we may well consider whether it is not the part of wisdom to reduce the revenues, even if we delay a little the 1 payment of the debt. It seems to me that the time has ar- I rived when the people may justly dc . mand some relief from their present on , erous burden, and that, by doe economy in the various branches of the public ! service, this may readily be afforded. 1 therefore, concur with the Secretary in recommending the abolition of all inter nal revenue taxes except those upon to i bacco in its various forms, and upon dis ; tilled spirits and fermented liquors, and I except, also, the special tax upon the | manufacturers of and dealers in such ar ! tides. 1 The retention of the latter tax isdesir ; able as affording the officers ef the Gov j eminent a proper supervision of these i articles for the prevention of fraud. I agree with the Secretary of the Treas ! ury that the law imposing a stamp tax ; upon matches, proprietary articles, play ing cards, checks and draff s may with propriety he repealed: and the law also i by which hanks and hankers are assess !cd upon their capital and deposits. 1 There seems to he a general sentiment j in favor of this course. 

REVISING THE TARIFF LAWS. 'fhe tariff laws also need revision, but ! that a due regard may be paid to the i conflicting interests ot our citizens, ini- i ; portaut changes should be made with caution. If .a careful revision cannot be I made at this session, a committee, snub , i as was lately appointed by the Senate. and is now being recoin mended by the i Secrutary of the Treasury, would doubt- ; i less lighten ii*n labors ot Uongress when -1 ever this subject shail };• brought to its | consideration. THE WAR DEPARTMENT, i The President endorses the recoin men • datum of the Secretary of War for an iu creaseof the army, details t he work done during the last year in collecting Indians J on their reservations, and says; The report of the Uhief of Engineers j furnishes a detailed account of the opei- i atious for the improvement of rivers and I harbors. I commend to your attention j the Suggestions contained in this report j in regard tc ibe condition of our fortiti- i cations, especially on nmur defences, and i recommend an increase of tha urengßi I of the engineer battalion, by which the j efficiency of our torpedo system would | he improved. I also call your attention , j to the remarks upon tin* improvement of ; j the South Pass of the Mississippi River, j the proposed free bridge over the Poto- • mac River at Georg town, the import- j ancc of completing at an early day the • north wing of the Department building, j and other recommendations of the Secre- 1 tary of War, which appear in his report. ' The actual expenditures of (his Depart- | i ment lor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1 I 18SI, were $42.122.20).39. The appropri- i I afions for the year JSB2 were $44.8*9,- j 725.42. The estimatca for 1883 were j j $44,541,27(5.91. THE 

NAVY DEPARTMENT. , The report of the Secretary of the i I .Navy exhibits the condition of that i | branch of the service, and presents valu- ! abhi suggestions for its improvement. I i call your especial attention, also, to tin* ; appended report of the Advisory Board j which he convened to device suitable measures for increasing the efficiency of ; the navy, and particularly to report as to ! the character and number of vessels ncc- i essary to place it upon a footing common- j surate with the necessities of the gov rnmgut. 1 cannot too strongly urge i I upon you n,y conviction that every con ! sideration of national gaiety, economy ; j and honor imperatively demand* a thor- : j ough rehabilitation of our navy, with * \ I full appreciation of the fact that cotnpli- ( ance with the suggestions of the head of i : t!;a,‘ department and of the Advisory ! ' Hoard must jnyolye a large expenditure j ot tin* public moneys. J earnestly ree- i j omniend such appropriaGous as y, id ac- j | complish an end which (o iuc ‘0 i desirable.

AFFAIRS OF THE I'OST OF FIFE. The report of the Bostinaster General is a gratifying exhibit of the growth and 1 efficiency of the postal service. The re ceipts from postage and other ordinary sources/luring the past fiscal year were $3(5.189.885.55. The receipts from the money order business were $295,581.39. making a total of $3(5,785,397.97. The expenditure for tho fiscal year was $39,- 251,733.4(5. The deficit supplied out of the general treasury was s2*. 181,129.35. ; or t> 3-10 per cent of the amount exnend e/1. Tho receipts were $3.-i09.915,(i:{ in excess of those of the previous year, and $4,575,397.97 in excess of the estimate l made two years ago, before tin* present. | period of business prosperity bad fairly i begun. I The whole number of letters mailed in ! this country in the last fiscal >ear ex ceeded one thousand millions. The reg , istry svsn-m is reported to he in excel ! lent condition, having been remodelled during the past four \ear* with good re sult. Tlie amount of registratimi fees /•olleet/’/l /luring the last fiscal year was : $712..->82.20, an increase over the li-cal year ending June 3(. 1*77, of $345,443,40. flic entire number of letLcrs and pack ages registered during the year was 8,- 1 8,919. of which onl\ 2,9il were lost or ; /iestroyed in transit. The operations of , tin* money older system are multiplying yearly under the impulse of immigration, of the rapid development of tne new States and Territories, and the conse quent demand for additional means of interior communication and exchange. During the pisfc year 33* additional . money order offices have been establish ed. making a total of 5.499 in operation at the da to o* this report, I luring the year the domestic money ordei > aggre gate/! in value .’‘105,075,769.35.

Legislation for tin* disposition of unclaimed money orders in rlie posses sion of the Lost Office Department Is reconimeinicd in view of the fact that Uucii total value row exceeds one million ; dollars. POSTAL SAVING BANKS. The attention of Congress is again in vited to tlie subject of establishing a I system of savings depositories in connec tion with tlie Post Office Department. THE STAR ROUTES. 1 As lias been already stated, great re ductions have recently been made in the expense of the Star Route service. The investiations of the Department ef Jus tice and tlie Post Office Department have resulted in the presentation of indict ments against persons formerly connect ed with that service, accusing them of I offences against the 1 idted Slates. I have enjoined upon the officials who are charged with tlie conductor the eases on the part of the government, and upon the eminent counsel who, before my ac cession to the Presidency, were called to their assistance, tlie duty of prosecuting, with the utmost rigor of the law. all peisous who may he found chargeable with frauds upon the postal service. INDIAN AFFAIRS. The rep >rt of the Secretary of the In ti rior contains many valuable suggestions particularly t mcliing upon the Indian questions. r \ fie Indian should receive the protection of the law. He should he allowed to maintain in court his rights of person and property, has repeatedly beg ged for this privilege. Its exercise would be very valuable to him in his progress towards civilization, (ff even greater importance is the enactment of a genera! law permitting the allotment in severalty, to such Indians at least as desire it, of a reasonable quantity of land secured to them by patent, and for their own pro tection made inalienable for twenty of twcnty-ive years, is demanded for their present welfare and their permanent ad vancement. 

SUPPRESSING POL VGA MV. For many years the Executive in his annual message to Uongress has urged the necessity of stringent legislation for the suppression of polygamy in the Ter ritories, and especially in the Territory of Utah. The existing statute for the punishment of this odious crime, so re volting to the moral ami religious sense of (’’n; ist n/lom, has been persistently and contemptuously violated ever since its 'enactment. Indeed, in spite of commen dable efforts on tin* part of tlie authori ties v.ho represent the United States in that Territ/u v, the law has in very rare , instances been enforced, and. for a cause to which reference will presently be made is practically a dead letter. The fact that adherents of the Mormon Uiiurch. which zests upon polygamy as its corner stone, have recently been peopling in large numbers Idaho. Arizona and other of our western territories, is well calculated to ■ : iixeitc the liveliest interest and appre- ; hension. it imposes upon Congress and i and the Executive the duty of arraying I against the barbarous system the power i which, under the Constitution and tlie law, they can wield for its destruction. | ; Reference lias been already made to ] thgso obstacles, wide!; the United States : ; officers hav.' encognfored in their efforts I to punish violators of ttu* law. l\omi- j nent among these obstacles is tlie diiii- j ; cully *f pioenring legal evidence sufii- I ciciit to warrant a conviction even in the ( case of Hie most notorious offenders. V.v.t attention is called to a recent ! opinion of li.e Supreme Court of the; United States, explaining its judgment of J reversal in the case of’Miles who had been convicted of bigamy in Utah. The i j Court refers to the fact, that the secrecy ■ ; attending the celebration of marriages j 1 in that Territory makes the proof of ’ ! p'iiygguiy vpry difficult, and the proprie | tv is suggest-nd /,f ipqdilyjng Die lap of j evidence, which now makes a wife ineom j petent to testily against her husband, j i I ids suggestion is approved.

PEXIJGN < LAI Ms. It appears, from me rcr (| o *i n* ( i missi/mer of Beiisions that, since I**s9, j 788,003 original pensions claims have j | been filed; 450.949 of these have been j allowed and inscribed on the pension roll j 72.539 have rejected and abandoned, be- j j ing Th pigs ner cent, of the whole num ber of claims sc* r f};ere are now | j pending for settlement 205.513 original j i pension claims, 227.040 of which were j filled prior to July 1. I**o. These, when allowed, will involve the payment of arrears from the date of discharge incase of an invalid, spid from date /! death or ! tennin ifion qf a prior right in all ofJier ; casec. Ffniß the data obtainable it is | estimated that it percent, uf t|;e num ber of claims now pending will be. reject ed or abandoned. This would show the , probable rejection of 34.040 cases, and | the probable admission of about 193.900 ' claims, all of which involve the payment 1 of arrears of pension. With the present ; force employed, the number of adjudi cations remaining the same, and no new business intervening, this number of claims (193,009) could be acted upon iu j a period of six years, ami taking January ! I, I*B4. as a near period from wliich to estimate in each case nu average amount of arrears, it is found that every case al- . lowed would require for the first payment * * upon It il.p sum of $1350. Multiplying - this amount by the whole number of probable admissions, gives $250,(MH.00U : as tiie sum required for first payments. This represents the sum which must i be paid upon claims which we refused . before July 1, I*B9, and are now pi-mi ing and entitled to the. benefits of the arrears ad. From the: amount (259.900.990) may be deducted from ten to fifteen millions 1 for cases win re the claimant dying there 1 is no person who under the law' would be entitled to succeed to the pension, leaving >'235.999,009 ;s tho probable amount to ‘ be paid. ‘ In these estimates no ‘account has been taken of tho 38.590 cases filed since June ■ 3*0(1). I**9. ami now pending, which must received attention as current business, i hut which /Id rot involve the payment of any arrears beyond tin* date of tiling the claim. Of this numb r it i.% estimated i that *' per cent, will be allowed. As I lias been stated with the present force of t in; Pension Bureau, 375 clerks, it is esti mated that it w ill take six years to dis pose of (he claims now pending. It is stated by tho Commissioner of 1 , Pensions that by an addition of 259 clerks ■ increasing the adjudicating force rather than the mechanical), double the amount of work could be accomplished, so tiiat : these cases could be acted upon within three years. Aside from the considera tions of justice which may be urged for a speedy self lenient of the c aims now I on tlie files of the Pension (• liicc, it is no ! i’*ss important on the score of economy, inasmuch as fully one-third of the cleri cal force of the ofiices now wholly occu . pied in giving attention to correspondence ; with the thousands of H Fu.iaiits whose cases have been on the tiles for the past eighteen years, the fact that a sum so enormous may he expended by the Gov ernment to meet demand for arrears of pensions, is an admoaitiou to Uongress : and the Executive to give cautious con sideration to any similar project in tin* . future. The great tempi.iti/m to the pre | ' s ntaiiou of tictitious ehtims afforded by 1 the fact that the average sum obtained up u each applicate n is $1309 leads me to suggest the propriety of making some special appropriation for the prevention i : : ' !\ !!. 

SEBV H I-: REFORM. I pon this question the President says: i In my letter accepting the nomination ! * j for the Viee-Presi/icncy, I state/* that, in : *! my judgment-. ":m nan should be the : incumbent of an office, the duties of s which he is for aiy cause unfit to per form, who is hu king in the ability, fulel* 1 S y or integrity which a proper adminis i t ration of such office demands/’ This j ‘ ’ sentiment would doubtless meet with , 1 general acquiescence, but opinion has ; been Avid< !y divided upon the wisdom and practicability of the various reform atory schemes which have been suggest ed and of certain proposed regulations , governing appointments to public office. . The efficiency m such regulations has been distrusted mainly because they . 1 nve seemed to exalt mere educational ’ ; and abstract tests above general business ip.icitv and even special fitness for the r p irticuhir work in hand. It seems to me [ that tne rules which slmuld be applied to . ; tlie management of the public service may properly conform in the main to t such as regulate the conduct of success ful private business. Original appoint- | ( incuts should he based upon ascertained J •fitness. The tenure of office should be | s able. Positions of responsibility should s ( far as possible be tilled by t lie promo r; n of worthy and efiie.icut officers. The investigation of al! complaints and the punishment /! al! official misconduct should be prompt and thorough. There arc very many characteristics 11 wliich go t make a model civil servant. ■ Frominent am/uig them are probity, in ‘ dnstry, g/>o/l sense, good habits, good temper, patience, order, courtesy, tact, ; si If-reliance, manly deference to superior ’ officers, ami manly c/>nsideration for in * f/’i iors. The absence of these traits is * not supplied with (lie knowledge of ! books or by promptitude in answering questions, or by any other quality likely 1 t'/ be brought to light by competitive ex aminations To m ike success in such a : contest, therefore, an indispensable con- I /iiiion of public employment, would very likely result in tlie practical exclusion of the older applicants, even though they might possess qualifications far superior to their younger and more brilliant com petitors. The suggestions must not be j * regarded as evidencing any spirit of op position to tlie competitive plan, which has been, to some extent, successfully employed already, and which hereafter may vindicate the claim of iis most earn est supporters. j • But it ought to be seriously considered whether application of the same educa tional standard to persons of mature , years, and to young men fresh from school and college, would not be likely to exalt mere intellectual proficiency j above other qualities of equal or greater | importance. Another feature of the pro- 1 posed system is the selection by promo- I 1 tion of all officers of the government above the lowest grade, except such as w. aid fairly bo legarded us exponents of tiie policy of the executive and the prin i ciplcs of tho dominant party. To afford encouragement to faithful public servants by exciting iu their minds ■ the hope of promotion if they are found to merit it is much lo be desired. But ■ ■ would it be wise to adopt a rule so rigid ‘ as to permit no other mode of supplying 1 ■ the walks of Uie service’.* There are j 1 i many persons who till subordinate posi- ' ! tions with great credit, but lack those | | qualities which are requisite for higher ' posts of duty: ami besides, the modes /if i ; *l. light and a&tion of onu whose service ! '• : in a governmental buieau lias been long : continued are often so cramped by rou- \ I line ]>rocedure as almost to disqualify | ' I him from instituting changes required by ! / • ;Ih* public interests. An infusion of new ! ' : blood from time to time into the middle ’ I ranks of tiie service might he very bene- , i ! licial In its results. Tiie subject under i i discussion is one of grave importance, j ( •1 3< ♦•vils v/hich are complained of can- : • not be eradicated at once. The work ! > | must be gradual. i The submission /if a pojtiar, of the \ / , iio:iui t aiii>Uo ui a ueiitral hoard of exam- j t I iners. jcleete/l soiely for testing the /jnali- 1 • ! cal ions of applicants, may. perhaps* with- | / 1 out resorting to the competitive test, put i | an end to the mischiefs which attend the ! i present, system of appointment, and it ! 1 I may be feasible to vest iu bqch *V board a 1 i | Avi/le uisprpfciqi; ap ascertain the charac- 1 s j terisn/aj and altainm/*nts /f candidates i j in those particulars which I have already | Ire fern*/1 to as being no less important J t •than mere intellectual attainments. IfJ : (”/nigress should deem it advisable at the j i present session to establish competitive ' . j tests lor admission to the service, no ; ] j doubt sq/ h as have been suggested -hall j * *4/ ter me i./i.u giving the measure my .

MEETING OF CONGRESS. Congress met on Monday last, in the Senate President pro tempore Davis oc cupied the chair, and Senator-elect Win dom, of Minnesota, was sworn in. A number of hills were introduced, among them the following: liy .Mr. Deck, to provide for the retirement of the trade dollar: by Mr. Sherman, to provide fur issue of d per cent bonds: by Mr. (Jar land. for a TariiV Commission; by Mr. Morrell, (or a tariff and tax commission; by Messrs, (hover and Miller. I restrict 1 Chinese immigration: and by Mi. f.ap- I bam. to punish attempts to assassinate : ‘ he President. Mr. Frye ottered a reso lution. which was laid over, providing I for a special committee of seven, to con sider ameiidmems to the Presidential i election laws. Mr. Edmunds offered a resolution that the standing and special committees of last session be revived and i continued. Mr. Pugh ottered an amend ment that the President of the Senate be ; authorized to decide upon the represen tation ot the respective parties on said ’ committees. Pending the matter the i Senate adjourned. The assembling of the first regular session of the Forty-seventh Congress had the effect of drawing to the Capitol a vast number of visitors. As early as ten o'clock the approach leading to the building presented a lively appearance, and by eleven every seat in the galleries of the House of Representatives (except in the space reserved for the Diplomatic Corps) was tilled, even tlie steps leading to them being utilized as seating places. <>n the floor the members indulged ii cordial handshaking and greetings. Air. Keifer stood for a short time in the rear i of the desks and was warmly congratu i lated by bis colleagues upon his success in obtaining the Republican nomination for Speaker. The hum of conversation and t he bursts of noisy laughter continued till twelve o'clock, when it was promptly hushed, when the Clerk of the House, Mr. Adams, called the body to order and announced the opening of the session. He then pro ceeded to call the roll, beginning with the State of Alabama. The roll call dis closed the presence of -So Representa tives elect: and the list of absentees was I called. The roll call was then finished and showed that 290 Representatives had answered to their names, the absentees being Messrs. Morse, Scales, Mills and Deuster. The election of officers of the House was next in order, and resulted as fol lows: J. tV. Keifer, of Ohio, was elect ed Speaker by 14. s vot.ns to 129 for S. J. Randall, and s for Nicholas Ford. The mcmbers-clect were then sworn in, ob jections to a number of them having been overruled by the House. The or ganization of the House was then com pleted by the election of Edward Mc- Pherson as Clerk, and also the other can didates nominated by the Republican caucus. Pending action on a resolution continuing the rules of the last Congress until otherwise ordered, the House ud ■ journed. 

HKKUAY. In the Senate several additional bills were introduced, among them one for the admission of Dakota as a State, and one by Mr. Pendleton for the reform of the civil service. Resolutions wore sub mitted by Messrs Deck and Maxey, di recting the Judiciary Committee to in quire whether legislation is necessary to provide for the Presidential succession in ease of vacancy. The resolutions were laid on the tabic, with the undestanding that they should be called up for discus sion next Tuesday. The President's mes sage was received, read, and ordered to be printed. Mr. Sherman's resolution for the appointment of a joint commit, tec to prepare an expression of the sen timent of the nation in regard to the death of President Garfield was taken up and agreed to. Several other hills were introduced, among them one by Mr. Blair, for the support of tHe com mon schools of the Inited States. Mr. Edmund* 1 resolution continuing the Sen- \ ate Committees was passed. In the House, all the Territorial Dele gates, except the Delegate from I tail, were sworn in. Mr. Haskell, of Kansas, ottered a resolution that Allan G. (’amp bell be sworn in us Delegate from I tali, but after some discussion the matter was postponed. The President's Message was read, ordered printed, and referred to the Committee of the Whole, Mi. Kinley, , of Ohio, offered a resolution, which was | unanimously adopted, for the appoint- i ment uf a committee of one member from 1 each State represented, to act incoujunc- ■ tion with a Senate committee, to prepare j a suitable expression in regard to the \ death of President Garfield. Mr. McEane asked leave to offer a resolution asking 1 the President to communicate to the I House the instructions sent to our Min isters to Chili and Peru, but Mr. Robe son objected. The House then ad journed until Friday, with the understanding that a further adjournment should then he i taken until Tuesday.
