BENJAMIN JIARMSOK. H quotes from the census eit cnsively itaw m the condition of various indus try il the country, he devotes some at tention o the tin plate industry and nt up to Sept. 30, 1892 there were dirty-two companies manufacturing tupiite in the United States aud four teen companies building new works for r.ct manufacture, lie estimated tho rite jf production at two hundred mil us pounds pur annum. Djr ng the year 1892, the value of inpor's entered free nf duty wat 65.35 percent jf the total value of imports as (cmoami with 33.C0 per cent in 1890. Ihrine tne year exports exceeded im ports by nearly three hundred million fciar. tie quotes other statistics ii' ng the increase ovor former years ways. "There nover has been a time a iur b'story when work waB so abun Jini or when wages were so high.

Tlie ''"ntii jfthe protective system with uuliuumshed confidence in the prin ipif ttipy lmvo advocated will await "'" t! if the new experiment. After wumirating a number of things, which ""bfOi.ji-ratic party has claimed the 8e tariff will accomplish nnd which ,!" president intimates are impossible, ) We have had in our history 'eveia exju-rieiices of contrabted effects 1 "-n-mi,, and protective tariff and the Upeiii-in'o f one generation is not '"!' ostructivo to tho next. Tho ) tea Ilh xplains that tho disturbed between employees and x in great manufacturing tiK-nts wore not favor- a calm consideration by '! earners of tho effect upon wages of M'e,T,v0 sy8tom nnd says: "Ho -" u w ba able to rovlew tho question ,B giit of his personal experience "'' " f tiie operation of a tariff for ""Hi- unly." He adds: Tho gen " p' .. ,-3 0 Wage reduction cannot " "tnplated by any patriotic citi ! " "it tho gravest npprehonsion " i is impossible for the Amo- ''"n manufacturer to compote sue- ssiu v with hiB foreign rival in many "' hen 0f nroduction without tho dfente of nrotectiro duties. . Tlie ounety unemployed now holding "tquiTit and threatening parades in the streets of foreign cities would not bo nl lowed to acquire an American domicile. Our relations with other nations are now undisturbed by any serious con troversy. Ho rolatos tho progress and advantages of reciprocity and recom onds that this policy bo maintained. Regarding tho sealing question he says: "I recommend that power be given tho president by proclamation to prohibit the taking of seals in tho south Pacific by American vessels. Tho presi dent is confident that our claims before the tribunal of arbitration will be sub stantially established. Speaking of our relation with Canada, ho says: "If as all must suppose, the political relations of Canada and com position of the Canadian government are to remain unchanged, a some what radical revision of our trade relations should be made, so that our relations may continue intimate and friendly. I regret to say, however, that in many controversies negotiations with Great Britain have been continuously thwart ed by unreaBonablo and unfriendly ob jections and protests from Canada. Ho refers to the advantages the Canadian railways have over American roads and sayB there is no disposition on tho part of the government of the United States to interfere in the smallest degree with the political relations of Canada. It is time for us, however, to consider whether if the present state of things continue in our entire independence of Canadian canals and of the St. Lawrenco as an outlet to the sea should not bo surrendered. He advises that tho sup port given to Canadian lines of rail roads and steamships be withdrawn. Speaking of our relations with Chili, the president tells of our good will to that country and present peaceful re lations and saye: I believe, however, that we must insist upon a just re sponsibility for any injuries inflicted upon our official repretentatotives or upon our citizens Tina will I believe promote peace and mutual respect. He urges tho completion of a sub marine cable between the United States and Hawaii and continued close rela tions with that govemrsi-nt. Italian Question. The president refers to the mutual respect and good will which has been promoted between this country and Italy by the recent payment of indem nity on account of the lynching of Itali ans in New Orleans, relations with other countries are specially mentioned, among them being Turkey in which connection the president calls atten tion to the troubles which American missionaries have recently met -with thero and mentions the promptness with which tho Turkish government granted indemnity for injury sustained by Americans. Tho Nicaragua Canal. The president next soeaka of tho Ni caragua canal and expresses a hope that tho present congrees may take some action which will result in the early completion of that enterprise. Freo Silver. In tlie clause relating to the monetary conference in Rrussells. the president says he has no doubt that the freo coin ago of silver upon an agreed interna tional ratio would probably promote tho interests of our people equally with those of other nations. Tho president further says on the Bilver question that owing to tho fact that the monetary conference is not kitting and that no conclusion has as yet been reached, he withholds any re commendation as to legislation upon that subject. Secretary of Treasury's Report. Speaking of the secretary of the treasury's report he says: There have been many misleading statctements as to the condition of the public revenues, and he mentions three preliminary facts to he born in mind. First: That tho public debt has been reduced since March 4, 1892. over $259,000,000. Sec ond that nearly $433,000,000 has been expended during this administration for pensions and third : That under the present tariff law $93,000,000 have been withdrawn from tho revenue by removing tho duty on sugar. The president concurs with tho recom mendation of tho secretary that the sinking fund law be repealed. Tin. rntirmiient of bonds in the future before maturity ehould bo matter of convenience not compulsion. We should not collect revenuo for that purpoeo but only uso any casual tur plus. Army Matters. Tho president agrees with the secre tary of war in recommending that tho email armv posta be abandoned and the army concentrated at largo posts which havo proper strategic relations to the frontiers. Tho work of building heavy guns and thi construction of coast de fenses should be carried on without check. Postal Affairs. Ho compliments tho postmaster cen eral upon tho conduct of his office. During tho past four years tho number of postoflices have been increased by 2,700. American Marino Tho president speaks of tho decadence th American marine and says in of lS92ouiy 12.3 percent of our imports wero brought in Aiuem-un .uuia. Foreign steamships maintained by our traffic aro many of them under contract with their respective governments by which in time of war they will become a part of thoir armed naval establish ments, profiting by our commerce in time of war. This condition of affairs is both intolerable and disgraceful. Tho President speaks of the improvement in conditions under tho law of 1891, whero bv numerous mail controcts havo been madoand many new vessals been builtor contracted to bo built in American ship yards. He earnestly urges the contin uance of tho policy inaugurated by this legislation and that appropriations re quired to meet obligations of tho government under those contracts may bo promptly made. The president calls nttention to tho inroads made by Cana dian subsidized lines in our Pacific coast commerce, and suggests that facil ities of custom entry and transportation across our territory are not such as to make tho Canadian route a favored one and that discrimination as to the im portation of these articles from Canada. No subject he thinks more nearly touches the power and prosperity of the country than this of tho development of the merchant marine upon the 6ea. In order to do this tho president thinks a payment of subsides to American lines should be made. Our Navy. The president speaks enthusiastically about the progress of the navy and de velopment in manufacture of tin plate as well as of offensive weapons. The organization of tho naval militia is characterised as an important achieve ment. Speaking of the navy, the presi dent says: "I earnestly express the hope that the work which has made such noblo progress may not now be stayed." The Indian Question. Tho president pays considerable at tention to tho Indian question, giving many points contained in the secretary of tho interior's report which has al ready been made public. Pensions. Concerning pensions, the maximum expendituro on that account will be reached Juno 30, 1894, and will be at its highest point which Is 1188,000,000 per annum but tho president adds: "I cannot beliove this process has yet reached the point with our people that would sustain the policy of remitting the care of these dieabled veterans to inadequate agencies provided by local laws. Agricultural Department. The president rofers to the work ot the agricultural department in the in spection of cattle shipped to foreign countries and eays that our expecta tions are largely promoted by a careful exclusion of diseased livestock. Pluro pneumonia no longer exists in the United States. The agricultural products continue 71.1 per cent. Our unprecedented ex ports for the fiBcal year ending June 30, 1892, show a total export of one billion thirty million two hundred eightyseven dollars nnd the agricultural exports amounted to seven hundred and ninety three million seven hundred nnd seven teen thousand dollars which exceeds by more than one hundred fifty million dollars the agricultural exports in any previous year. ' Promising work for the benefit of the American farmers has been begun through the agents ot the agricultural department in Europe in the way of efforts to introduce our various products there as food. The suggestions of the secretary of agriculture for the enlarge ment of "tho department work are re recommended to your favorable con sideration. The Cholera. Concerning tho quarantine against cholera in August the president eays the whole subject of quarantine should bo taken into National control and ade quate power given the executive to pro tect the people againit plague invasions. The president recommends a liberal appropriation at this session to prose cute the work of guarding against a recunence of the plague next spring. Immigration. Tho president holds it is now his duty to the people especially to tho working classes not only to keen out vicious, ignorant pauper and contract labor im migration but to cheek too great a flow of immigration by further restrictions. World's Fair. The construction and preparation of opening the world's fair, May next has progressed most satisfactorily and upon a scale of liberality and magnificence that will worthily sustain the honor of tlie United State's. Election Laws. The president says lie has in three annual messages called attention to the evils and dangers connected with tlie election methods as related to the choice of national government repro rentatives and eays he cannot close this meseage without again calling at tention to thebe crave aud threatening oyils. "II is time mutual charges of unfairness nnd fraud between the great parties siiould cease and that the sin cerity of those who profess desire for pure and honest elections should be brought to tho test of their willingness to freo our legislation and election methods from everything that tends to impair public confidence. The neces sity for inquiry by congress upon this subject is emphasized by the fact that the tendency of legislation m some states in recent years has in some im portant particulars been away from ami not toward free and fair elections and equal apportionments. General Rocommondatlons. The president recommends legislation for tlie regulation of tho liquor traffic in tho district of Columbia; also for the better protection of railioad em ployees. An appropriation as nskod for by tho civil service commission is recom mended. He compliments the reports of tho va rious cabinet officers. The meseage closes as follows: "This brief exhibit of growth and prosperity of the country will give us a level from which to note the increase or decadence that new legislative poli cies may bring to the United States. There is no reason why national in fluence, power and prosperity should not observo the same rates of increase that characterized the past thirty years. There is no reason why, in many linest of nroduction. wo should not surpass all other nations, as we have already done in some. There is no near lrontiers to endanger our possible development, and retrogression would bo a crime. "Bkkjamis F. Haiiuison."

LBVI P. MORION. supposed effects of a tariff for revonue, teemed to meet with general approval on the Republican" side of the chamber but attracted little attention on the other eide. Various subjects discussed in the peage, however, seemed to have very little interest for Bonatora on either side. At the conclusion of the reading of the message Vest offered a resolution in reference to "pernicious activity of tho census bureau in the recent election and proposing an investigation." It will be called up for action tomorrow. A petition was presented by Peffer from the citizens of Kaneas, alleging tho existence of a combination between the elevators, millers and railroads of Minneapolis and St. Louis, to depreci ate the price of grain. It was referred to the committee on agriculture. Chandler introduced a bill for the sus peniion of immigration one year.

Vest aleo offered a resolu' ion reciting tho allegation in the public press, charging gross misconduct on tho part of the consus employees, especially enumerators in tho state of Missouri, who are said to have taken a list of voters for partiean use, and also charg ing certain clerks of the census bureau sent to the state of New York during the recent election to perform partisan service, and directing an investigation of such charges by the senate commit tee on census.

In tho senate ns soon ns the secretary had finished read ing the journal a messenger handed him the president's message which he proceeded to read. Tho death of Re presentative Warwick of Ohio, was an nounced and ns a mark of respect the house adjourned. . The financial theories of tho Third Partv were emphasized today in a bill introduced bv Otis (Kansas) having the voluminous "title, "To change our monetary system, reduce interest, fix unit value, supply fetates with their circulating medium nnd for other pur poses." Tho bill is amedentatory to one introduced at the last session. It fixes tho dollar as a unite of value and declares all paper money mentioned in tlie act to bo absolute upou its faco and nnr in llio fnrtn nf !1 IirOIllisC. All I money specified is to be full legal tender to the amount of $5 in any one tran saction. In addition to tho provisions for freo coinage in the previous bill the measure provides for money paid for bullion in the treasury to be converted into the treasury as a part of the "general fund." Immediately upon the passage of this act the secre tary of the treasury is required to have coined all gold and silver bullion in tho hands of tho general government for any purpose and to havo prepared at as early a date as possible fifteen hundred million dollars in paper money, all of which, gold, silver and paper money will be used to form part of tho general resorve. Secretary Foster, of the treasury, is directed to prepare the amount of paper money, not to exceed in volume 60 per cent of the assessed value of real estate of the United States as shown in the last census to be held in the general treas ury as "states improvement fund," and only to be paid out on order of tho respective governors and secretaries of the states. Any state may avail itself of the provisions of this act by a joint resolution of the legislature, and the state is required to pay the United States an annual tax of 1 per cent on all sums drawn and retained during each year and to open and keep in op eration an exchange and a general de posit at some department at the capital of tho etatee. Harter, of Ohio, introduced a bill providing for the cessation o' bilver bullion purchases January 1, 1993, and tho sale on one million ounces of silver bullion for gold. Telegraphic Briefs.

WATER CASE. Important Decision for Water Owners. Howthe Colorado Courts View the Case. The Supreme Court Makes an Important Decision. A CaseComes Up In Which Priority Water Claims Are Considered By the Courts. Gkeklkv, Colo., Dec. 0. Associ ated Press. The caBeof the Cache La Poudre Irrigating Company vs. the Catche La Poudre Irrigat ing Ditch Company, the Larimer and Weld Reservoir Comanv, the Dry Creek Ditch Company and the Larimer and Weld Irrigation Company, was put on -trial in the district court Tuesday morn ing and lasted until late yesterday evening. Being a cas? in equity, no jury was impaneled. It look about two and one-half hours for the attorneys to read the pleading, but the caeo in a few words is to prevent the defendants from taking water from the little Cache La Puudre Ditch, located in Larimer county, under water stock shares or by any other means. It appears that this ditch was located many years ago, and owns some twenty-four water rights, eome of which have been acquired by the defendants. The plaintiff claims that by the defendants getting water under these shares it is deprived of water that it is entitled to. aud injures the rights of the original stockholders, especially in eeaoons of scarcity of water; and that by the de fendants acquiring Block in the ditch it is really allowing subsequent appro priatora to get the benefit of older ap propriations. Some lime ago the supreme court de cided that ehares in a ditch company could be transferred as other personal property, unless it could be Bhown that such transfer was not injurious to the original appropnutors, and the plaintiff put in evidence to snow that the stock holders of this ditch have been and will be iniuied bv allowing the defendant companies to take a portion of the water during the months oi July and August especially, as well as later in the sea eon, when it is necessary to irrigate al falfa, potatoes and other late crops. The defendants put on witneeees to show that all the water taken by them has been used for beneficial purposes, and that there had been no waste. The case is an attack againet the present system of selling water to sub sequent appropnators, thereby depriv ing the one next in order of its right, and plaintiff seeks to establish a rule that when a prior appropnator has more water than ho needs, it must go to the next appropriator in line of pri ority. This, if correct, will prevent the sale of water rights to subsequent ap propriators, unless tbey are next in or der of priority. The sale of water rights to the Lari mer and Weld Reservoir company, whose priority is long subsequent to that of plaintiff is the immediate caueo of the suit. Plaintiff also claims that tho water must be applied to the land appropriated for, under that ditch, and that water cannot be traded by different ditches. The evidence ie somewhat conflicting as to the waste of water and the ques tion of injury to prior apporpnators. By this case the constitutionality , of a great many of our la as, concerning water rights may come in question. Judge Downer took the matter under advisement and no matter what his de cision may be, there is no doubt but what it will be hotly contested in the supreme court, as it involves a vital question in irrigation. It is undoubtedly ono of the most im portant irrigation questions ever brought up in our courts, and one that our ditch and reservoir stockholders and irrigators generally aro deeply in terested in. The ablest legal talent on questions of irrigation, in northern Colorado were engaged by the litigants. J. E. Garrigues appeared for the plain tiff; Judge Ballard of Denver, Hon. James W. McCreery and Harry N. Haynes of this city appearing for Jheir respective defendant clients.
