In many cases collectors have received but one-half the number of stamps they-were entitled to, which in view of the fact that the collector is in duced to exchange by positive misrepresentation N ampunts to little short of actual robbery. Collectors are again warned to pay no attention to such state ments.

PRESIDENT PB1ISED I BlTff S PAPER is- W Attitude on Japanese 'Question j.Aplaudedby Coaim^ie^ 'H* Some Mu^ Thrown, *,ll"',"v Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 7.Commenting on President.Roos^eit's message, Wil liam J.-Bryattsays^iiere dp much that is good and^much^thftt is bad in it,, but it may be regarded as the presi dent's most important state paper. Mr, Bryan says: "The message states much that is democratic, and for which the general public may well thank him. *It states some things that ought to arouse se vere criticism. The president boldlv appropriates -some of the doctrines which the democrats have been advo cating, and, on the other hand, he an nounces some doctrines which are so absurd as to excite amusement if the suggestions came from a less promi nent source. In some cases he takes advanced grounds in some case he re treats from ground already taken Mr. Bryan complains that ^what the president says on the subject of gov ernment by injunction wili not be sat isfactoryy President' stand on to the laboring man or to thoseu respect the right of trial 7.J ?who Th child* labor is commended, as" is also the position he has taken on the eight hour Jaw and the right of the people to criticize a judge. Praises Jap Reference. Referring to Mr. Roosevelt's refer ence to the Japanese question, Mr Bryan says: ''He pays a deserved tribute to the progress of the Japanese nation and asks for legislation which will enable congress to protect the rights of for eigners. That there should be such legislation cannot be generally dis puted, but a great deal depends upon the character Of the legislation. If any bills are presented in regard to this suggestion* th0y-.must be carefully scrutinized to be sure that they do not deny to'the':various states the right' to protect themselves and their people in matters purely local.*' Finally, Mr. ^Bryan deplores what he calls the president's, warlike attitude. 

GILLETTE OWNED GUILT? Officials Do Not Deny Report that Con fession Was Overheard. Journal Special Service. Herkimer, N. Dec. 7.-Herkimer county officials, who had a hand in the prosecution of Chester Gillette, con victed of the murder of "Billy" Brown, have virtually confirmed the statement that Gillette was overheard confessing to, his lawyer that he struck the girl after she was in the water. This they do by refusing to deny it, and that is enough of an admission to satisfy Herkimer folk that the state ment is true.: The announcement has aroused new and greater indignation among the peo ple. The sheriff's department has re ceived additional letters threatening1 the life of Gillette should he ever go free, and one writer hwfnented that he was to get off so easy as a simple snuf fing out of his mortal existence by elec tric shock. .i-nT? _j.V'. WINDWAGON ON BROADWAY Success of Dr. Thomas' Experiment %maieli^w Y^icers. Journal Special Sjjryloe. 4 New Yorkp Dec.B ?.i-Dr. Julian P. Thomas last night operated,the first mato&driven/ wiiidwagon ever^un in this country. In effectiveness it ex ceeded even his expectations and -his Chief difficulty was in checking* its speed. With a free course it would easily run away from anything except a very fast automobile. 1 Incidentally, Dt. Thomas was respond sible for more excitement on Broadway than has'been ^en in many a day. Horses shied and' pedestrians crossing the street rushed in a panic for. the sidewalks. With the gasolene engine snapping like $jh#t.-of a racing auto mobile and the Jpfrieat propeller blades swishing thru rtfe air: as they swung ahead of the majffaine, the effect was as startling as if a real flying machine had been sailing between the lines of ex cited persons on both sides of the street.
