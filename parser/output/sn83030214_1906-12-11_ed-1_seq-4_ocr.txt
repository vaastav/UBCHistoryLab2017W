Tl c magnitude of the transactions. Involving many millions of dollars, left no doubt In my mind as to the party furnishing the capital, and that if said transfers- or drilling contracts were- allowed to stand the oil Industry in the Indian Territory would be practically under the control of the cor poration which already dominates to a large extent the oil Industry of the country. The parties there fore were required to comply strictly with tr.e regu lations and reduce their holdings within the limit prescribed by the regulations— 4.800 acres to one person or corporation. Not satisfied, however, the parties endeavored to secure a reversal or modification of the depart mental regulations from the President, but having been fully advised of my action in the premises the President declined to make any modification and directed that the rulings he enforced, of which the attorney of said parties was duly notified. It Is a matter of gratification that the lessees, parties to the transfer, have acquiesced in the rul ing of the department and have so signified their acceptance In writing. THE

"Wnile property other than mines and railroads was assessed at from 40 to 75 per cent of its value., it. was estimated that the mines, with all their improvements, were as pessed at not more than •", per cent of their value. Although the product of the mines In 1904 was wot more than $30,000,000, all the mines in the territory, with their 'improvements, were returned for taxation in 1905 at a valuation of less than $5,000,000.

May Be a Test Vote in the House on Wednesday. [Fwm Th» Trihiin* Bureau. 1 "Washington. Dec. Simplified spelling had an airing in the House to-day when, the Legislative. Executive and Judicial bill, which contains a pro vision barring the new orthography in documents authorized by law and order by Congress, was taken up. Representative Gillett. of Massachusetts, who fought this provision when It was under considera tion in committee, gave the House to understand to-day that he would raise a point of order on the new legislation, and this precipitated a discussion in which some of the House humorists attempted to have fun with what Champ Clark termed this "new fangled kind of spelling." As no vote was taken, there was no opportunity to test the relative strength of the simplified spelling advocates and their opponents in the House-, but this will prob ably be determined on Wednesday. Representative Clark, of Missouri, announced with great posltiveness that he wanted either a complete reform of the whole system of spelling. bo that everybody might begin on the same tooting , or none at all. "I am also In favor." he said, "of adopting some standard system of shorthand writ ing in place of the present form of handwriting so that we might save time in that respect. I believe that If we had complete phonetic spelling and shorthand writing taught in the schools it would pave between three and five years in the education of every child." Mr. Olllett said that the new spelling ordered by the President In the printing of executive docu ments was not a revolutionary change, but that the adoption of simplified spelling was merely to ac celerate the progress in spelling which Is going on every year. Representative Livingston, of Georgia, said In the course of a speech on the bill that he understood the President would send a special message to Congress in a few days recommending a 20 per cent increase in the salaries of all government employes. Under the wide latitude of debate. Mr. Macon. of Arkansas, delivered a speech on "bucketshops" and in favor of his bill prohibiting gambling in agricult ural commodities, and Mr. Sheppard. of Texas, criticised the manner in which appropriation bills were prepared. NEW 

JERSEY WINS sriT. Corporation Tax Case Decided by Supreme Court. "Washington. Dec. 10.— Question of the taxa tion of a New Jersey corporation doing business In Illinois was involved in the case of New Jersey vs. W. F. Anderson, trustee of the Cosmopolitan Power Company, which was decided to-day by the Supreme Court. The suit grew out of a controversy over taxes due New Jersey on the company's fran chise for 1903 and 1903. and also involved the ques tion as to whether taxes should have preference over other debts where the debtor Is insolvent. The case was tried in the United States Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois, which allowed $4,934. and the verdict was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The state claimed $9,234. , and appealed the case. The opinion in- the eas* was handed down by Justice Day, and was favorable to the state. The decision of the Court of Appeals was reversed on the ground that under the bankrupt law state taxes should have preference. The Chief Justice. Justice Harlan and Justice Peckham united In a dissenting opinion. Finding th» principal question Involved to be whether the claim was a tax legally due and ow ing to the State of New Jersey. Justice Day said: We think the weight of judicial decision In that state favors the view that this is a tax imposed upon the right of the corporation to continue to be a corporation, with power to exercise its corporate franchises, based upon tho amount of Its capital stock Issued and outstanding. He. could not. he said, accept the view that th« case presents a question of contract, as the char ter is absolutely controlled by the state. He added: The bankrupt act requires the payment of nil taxes legally due and owing. We think th« tax thus assessed upon that basis was legally due and owing, although not collectable until after the ad judication. We reach the conclusion that under the bankruptcy act these taxes, in the amounts hereinbefore indicated, were entitled to preferential payment In favor of the Stats of New Jersey.
