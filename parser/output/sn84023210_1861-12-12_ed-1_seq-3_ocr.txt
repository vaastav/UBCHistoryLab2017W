O'CLOCK p. ivi. FROM WASHINGTON. New York, Dec. 12. The World's Washington dispatch states that it is not probable that any decided emancipation scheme will be successful as even if it was pas sed by Congress it would be vetoed by the Pres ident. It is probable that many European manufac turcs which can be supplied at home will be charged with high duties. The Herald's dispatch says that Bigelow Law rence ol Boston has succeeded in prevailing on the Government to send a war vessel to protect American commerce in the Mediterranean. BY TELEGRAPH 10 THE FREEMAN. 7 O'CLOCK. A . M. vroii roar pick ens. A private letter received at New York, from on board the steamer Richmond which took part nitha fight at Fort Pickens, dated Nov. 23d, states that that vessel commenced bombarding rort lucitae at 1U o cloeic on the 22tl. The writer says he bad been complimenting the Captain of one of tbo gnus, on the accura cy of his aim, when a shell bouneed through our bulwa;ks and look bis head off, and wound ed six more men. This shell, on exploding, raised tho ship out of tho water and mado her stagger like a drunken man. Another shell burst six feet below the water line, causing a bad leak, but tho steam pumps kept the vessel i free. I Tbo firing continued all day and was resumed by the enemy (ho next morning, when the Richmond moved out of range. The frigate Niagara still kept at them, but being outside ot the bar she was not much injured. Fort Pick ens had, up to date, lost but one man killed, and seven wounded. Fort McRae is much dam aged, but we cannot destroy it with our smooth bore guns, as they are no match for tho enemy's rifled cannon. The bombardment was to bo renewed tho next day, the 24th, with the de termination to whip or bo whipped. FROM GEN. BANKS DIVISION. Frederick, Md., Dec. 11.

Mr. Lanbay's resolution was then taken up and toiuidefid. Mr. staviiia said if the resolution is to have a good fillet, especially in the West iho sooner ,it is pitsbed the Letter. The allegation of Gen. 'llulkck that lugitive slaves' information to the tneuiy is too bold a pretence to justify hhn. Ehe return of fugitives was intended by Gen. McCklhiu und followed by Kelly and Uix. All these casja are a disgrace to tho profession of arms. If men return has been mado by tho or ders ot the comiuanyiug generals thoy deserve to bnvo tlio epaulettes snipped frotu tlteir snoul dtis ; if by higher authority, then God forgiva theiu, they know not what they do. , Mr. Lnvejoy expressed his honest convictions that such orders were iesued by commanding Rcnerals, without authority from tho President.

A letter from Key West of tho 5th instant, states that their Pensacola dates are of tho 26th ult. It appeared that the rebol steamers have bficn plving between tho Navy Yard and town, constantly carrying guns, munitions, &c. Col. Brown notified Bragg that he should firo on them, to, which Bragg replied, "fire away." On the :.raorning of the 22J, two stcamera again appeared. Col. Brown disabled one, the other escaped. A general cannonuding then took place between Fort Pickens and Fort Bar rancas, tho Niagara and Richmond oponing on Fo-t McRae and several water batteries, the eu pagamont lasting nearly two whole days. Fort McRae was silenced, also the water batteries in leach of tho Richmond's guns. No person was injured aboard tho Niagara. James Cook was the person killed on the Richmond. Both ves sels were slightly damaged in tho upper work. Fort Pii-kens had not even a sand basi displaced the Fort Barrancas fire. On the 24th, v. hile fnsn from ft shell, it exnloded, kill ing five men, and wounding many others. Col. Brown says he has Fort Barrancas com pletely at his mercy and is awaiting reinforce ments to hold tho Forts when ha shall take them. Another letter states that one of Wilson's Zouaves was killed and another wounded on the 22d. About 2500 guns were fired in the two days. At 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the 23d, Warrington was set on fire by our guns, and that place and nearly all tho Navy Yard de stroyed. Tho Bteamer Times was disabled at tho first shot. The rebel firo slackened on the sec ond day. Two companies of Wilson's Zouaves have chargo of tho batteries near tho fort, and the remainder of the regiment are in trenches to ropel a midnight attack. Tho heaviest rebel guns arc near thc light house, and their best mortars on both sides of tho hospitals. Tho Water battery belowFort McKae is a bad customer. Tho rarges of our artillery are splendid.
