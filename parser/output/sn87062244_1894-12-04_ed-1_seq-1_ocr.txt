There wae the usual attendance of sightseers, though ' not as large as on many occasions, for Con gress has been so constant!' in session during the past sixteen months that its reassembling attracted less attention than on some other occasions. Promptly nt 12 o'clock Vice Preeldont Stevenson called the Senate to order and Chaplain Milburn, in eloquent terms, pro nounced the opening prayer. He referred feolingly to the critical illness through which She daughter of the Vice President had safely , Dassod.

The tall, gaunt form of Mr. Sherman moved about the chamber much of the time, being on tho Democratic side. Mr. Gorman passed among bis associates, giving greetings with that suavity which is eueh a marked characteristic with him. Mr. Poffer sat in his rear seat, absorbed in a news paper. Messrs. Jones, of Arkansas, and Hams, of Tennessee, who had borne tbo brunt of the tariff work last fall, conferred together. Senators Voorhees and Vest, the two other oonspieuous figures of tho last BOnnEE OOCKXAX, WHO CREATES BOOMLETS. tariff battle, had their heads together during the recees. The galleries looked in vain for Mr. Hill, of New York, who was still absent in Florida. On the Republican side was Mr. "Woloott, of Colorado, who has been so promi nently identified in tho light for silver, con ferred with Mr. -Cameron, of Pennsylvania. On the reassembling of the Senate at 1:30 Messrs. Harris and Manderson reported that the President would communicate with tho Senate by ono of his secretaries. Executive Olerk Pruden immediately appeared at tho main door, and the mesage was carried to the Vice President, who directed that it bo read. There was special attontion given to tho reference to the China-Japan war. Itwa3 the first official information known oven to members or the Foroign Committee. It was much briefer, however, than had been ex pected, and left still open the exact dotails of the negotiations. Shortly before tho reference to China-Japan was reachod the Chinese minister, attended by Mr. Chung, an attache, entered the gallery leservoi for the diplomatic corps and were interested listeners to tho foroign features ot the message.

The complainants say they aro poor and ig norant and wero misled.

New Yoke, Doc. 8. President H. O. Havo meyor, of tho American Sugar Beflulng Com pany, this afternoon gave out tho following signed statement: "If any ono will fairly and dispassionately consider tho President's recommendation about sugar, it will bocomo appnrent that it comes down to this: 'Tho sugar company has taken action, the result of which is to doprivo temporarily of work 25,000 porsons employed in tho various Industries dependent upon tho refining of sugar, together with tho members of their families. I recommend such action as to doprivo those porsons of work perma nently. If tho industry is languishing, tho proper course is to destroy it. "There are some things which can bo es tablished through a demonstration. A com parison of tho duty put by tho tariff bill upon various articles will show that while tbo maximum protection accorded to sugar is 5 per cent., other and more favored articles re ceive protection up to 40 per cent, and 60 per oent. -"Why this discrimination should bo made against a largo number of persons who hold tho stock in tho company and are employed in its refineries it is impossiblo to say. Thoy protest against it. The answer to this protest in tho President's message is that as the prosent protection is inadequate it ought to bo removed altogetbor. ' " 'Reasonable legislative aid' requires that tho sugar Industry shall bo treated ns other important industries. If this is done tho in dustry need not languish, and 'thousands of discharged workmen' will have remunerative employment. "The country has nlrendy pronounced its judgment upon the mode In which tho Inst Congress dealt with tho Interests of working- men. The President apparently has not learned tho lesson. "It ought not to roquire much timo for workmen to appreciate thnt tho Presidont in a bid for personal popularity is willing to strike a death blow nt their interests. "II. O. Havesieyeh."

Mr. Holmos said it would bo tho duty of tho workors in Amorica.as thoy had dono in Eng land, to put down faction and insist upon united action. His speech aroused much en thusiasm. Ho warned laboring men ngainst divisions on account of politics. Ho said: "In Lnnca3hiro whon wo worklngmon ro quiro nnything, wo invito our parliamentary representatives to attend a mctting aud thoy have novor opposod our views. Thoy have more sense, for if thoy opposed us we would send them about thoir business." Chairman Gompers then introduced Mr. John Burns, whom he roforred to as the hero of Trafalgar Square. Mr. Burns, on coming forward, was ro coived with an ovation, no spoko distinctly nnd with ease. Ho said in part: "I esteem it a groutor honor than if I wero a delegate from kings or potentialities to bo a raomber of tho embassy from English work lngmon to you in America.

"an Immonso amount of scamped work, and it appears to mo to have been a clear caso of 'job, job and job again.' This you workingmen aro responsible for, whilo you allow tho contractors' system. I have been in every largo city In Europe, and I bavo never seen a city with such a futuro as New York if prop erly organized." Speaking of tho pensions paid to tho vet erans of tho civil war, Mr. Burns jaid: "Theso men fought for u great principle. It was right to roward tnom. But if you deem it right to roward these men. who at best were partakorslu tho bloody ami brutal trade of war, do you not consider thnt tho toilers in tho slums, tho mon who in removing gar bage from your streets inhalo malarial odors, which brim: them to the gravo; tho men who in tho mines of Pennsylvania lose their lives in obtaining for your homos light nnd heat; the men who toil in tho furnaces of Pittsburg and other cities. "Do you not think that tho families of these men whoto lives have been lost iu Eeaccful employment, or who, broken down in ealth, wear out tho ends of their lives In your slums amid misery nnd starvation aro more worthy of pensions than thoso who fought In battlo? It is tho voice ot tho IiusLandless woman and the fatherless orphan which I hear crying for tho justice they have been denied." Mr. Burns concluded by saying ho had more pity for tho American women thnn tho men. It wns thoy who hnvo the greater pri vations.
