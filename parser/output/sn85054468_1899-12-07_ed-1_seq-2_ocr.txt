HOUSE BILI.S rWTBODUCED. Affnlr.s of nepiictiiient Employes Riven Considerable Attention. A bill that would affect a large number of departmental clerks should it become a law was introduced in the House by Rep resentative Ball of Texas. It provides that atij person now on the pension roll and in the Government service receiving $100 per month or more shall have their pensions withheld during incumbency in office. Upon the termination of their civil em ployment the pensions are to be restored. Representative Hrosius of Pennsylvania lias submitted a measuie for the benefit ot clerks under the classified service. It is to establish a pension retirement roll. Be ginning July l, 1900, 2 per cent of the sal ary of these employes is to be deducted each month to constitute a civil service fund to be held in trust by the Secretary of the Treasury, who shall invest it in interest-bearing bonds of the United States. Such bonds shall be sold at the discretion of the Secretary to secure cash as needed. The first retirements are to begin on July 1. 3904, the annual retired pay to be 7." per cent of the highest pay received at any time while the person has been in the civil service of the Government. After twenty years' service those physically or mentally incapacitated can be retired. Those attain ing sixty years of age and having served thirty years may be retired. Anyone at taining the age of seventy-five and having served thirty-five years may be compul- sorily retired. Applications for retirement shall be made to the Civil Service Commis sion. Any employe who shall be discharge! before becoming eligible for retiienicnt shall have the amounts withheld from him during his term of office refunded. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make all needful regulations to carry the measure into effect. Representative Capron of Rhode Island introduced a bill asking for 550,000 to pre pare a site for the erection of a monument in this city to Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burn side. Representative Fitzgerald of Massachu setts submitted an amendment to the Con stitution to be proposed to the Legislatures of the various States, providing that from March 4, 1901, the teim of President shall be for six years and he shall be ineligible for re-election. Three-fourths of the Leg islatures are required to ratify the meas ure. Another effort is made to make Abraham Lincoln's birthday a national holiday. Rep resentative William Alden Smith of Mich igan is the latest to introduce a bill to that effect. Representative Bull of Rhode Island asks an appropriation of $25,000 to erect a bronze statue in memory of the late Hon. George Bancroft, formerly Secretary of the Navy, upon the grounds of the Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md. Representative Bingham of Pennsylvania wants the United States Ambassador to France directed to have the remains of John Paul Jones disinterred and brought to this country on a United States man-of-war and interred in Arlington Cemetery. Mr. Butler of Pennsylvania introduced a bill to create the office of warrant pay clerks in the Navy after pay clerks have served twelve years in that capacity, five of which shall be sea service. Other bills introduced were: By Representative Bull of Rhode Island, to erect a statue in Washington to James G. Blaine to cast 450,000. By Representative Littaucr of New York, for the adoption of the metric system of weights and measures.

By Representative Mercer of Nebraska, for the establishment of a postal savings bank. Among the mass of bills introduced were 163 by Representative Brownlow of Tennes see, who now holds the record for the greatest number in one day. 

CURRENCY BILL ADOPTED. Uciiiiblienn Caucus ScmmI the Meas ure to the Public Printer. The Republican members of the House In caucus yesterday afternoon without a dis senting vote adopted the Administration's currency bill "to define and fix the stand ard of value, to maintain the parity of all forms of money issued or coined by the United States," etc. The caucus, which was a continuation of the one held Tuesday night, was called to order at 2 o'clock by Chairman Cannon. He called Representative Hepburn of Iowa to the chair, and took the floor to make some observations on the measure. He spoke for half au hour. iu voting his re marks to that section of the bill authoriz ing national banks to issue circulating notes up to the par value of the bonds de posited to secure their circulation. He was very free in his criticism of this section of the bill, and expressed his willingness to see it omitted. He had prepared an amendment which he had intended to offer to the section of the bill, but at the sug gestion of the caucus committee which was appointed during the closing hours of the last Congress to draft the bill, he re frained from doing so. The only other critcism made was by Representative Warren ot Illinois, who, it is said, forced the adjournment of the cau cus Titesdar night. He doubted the wis dom of the section impounding greenbacks exchanged for gold until they are released for another exchange for gold. He was op posed to this feature of the measure, be cause in his opinion it meant the retire ment of the greenbacks. Representative Hill of Connecticut, who has been most pronounced in his view on the currency question, took exception to the criticism made by Mr. Warner, and con tended that this provision of the bill did not retire the greenbacks, which he dtplred to have done. Speeches in favor of the bill were made by Representative Dolliver of lowa and Payne of New York. The former made a ringing speech in favor of the gold standard and in support of the measure. In section 4 of the bill, to obviate any possible misunderstanding, the word "re demption" was inserted to identify without question the fund to be held for that pur pose. An additional section was added, changing section 10 of the national banking act so as to make the limit of the issue of circulating notes to any bank to 100 per cent of its capital stock. As originally drawn the bill provided Chat the amount of notes to lie issued to a bank should be in creased from 90 to 100 per cent of the par value of bond deposited to secure their redemption. No raentiou was made of the capital stock restriction, and it was feared by some that it might be held to be re pealed by implication, thus removing nil restriction upon the ainouut to be Ubucd, except the ability of the bank to deposit bonds. The bill, with the foregoing changes, which were made by the caucus committee th&t drafted the measure, was sent to the Public Printer last night with an order for the printing of two thousand copies for the Ubc of the House. Today Representative Over&treet, having charge of the bill, will introduce a resolu tion asking the Commutes on Ru'es when appointed to report a special order fixing a period for a discussion of the measure. Unless a change is made in the programme. the House will take up the bill next Mon day and vote 'on it the latter part of the week. TWO VACANCIES TO FILL. Seuule Dl.strlet Committee to lie Kc orKriuilzoil. Two vacancies exist In the Senate Com mittee on the District of Columbia, caused by the retirement of Senators Gorman of Maryland and Faulkner of West Virginia. Thre is also a rumor that Senator Bncon jf Georgia withes to bs relieved from far ther service on this committee. It v. & said yesterday that the flrjit moot ing of the committee would be held on the first Friday following the reorganization of the Senate committees. The complexion of the committee politi cally will be somewhat changed when its membership is again completed, as it is understood to be the intention to appoint only one Democrat, and it is also stated on good authority that Senator Stewart ill change his seat from the Democratic side of the committee table to that of the Republican side. Senator McMillan, Chairman of the com mittee, is doing all that is possible be fore a meeting is held, to get the affairs of the committee in working order. Yes terday he reintroduced a number of Dis trict bills for which ho had been personally responsible at the last session of Con gress, among them being the following: A bill to provide for the appointment of a collector of fines in the Police Court; to compel street railway companies .n the District to itraove abandoned tracks; to provide for a board of charities; to provide for the compulsory support of children by their parents; to regulate insurance; to provide for the publication of Revolution ary archives in the Department of State; a bill concerning land titles, and several personal relief bills. NAMED BY SENATOR ALLISON. The Itepi:ltllca:i Committee on Com. iiiltteeM Seleeted.

McMillan of Michigan, Hansborough of North Dakota. Perkins of California, Lodge of Massachusetts, El kins of West Virginia, Spooner of Wis consin, and Piatt of New York. The members of this committee were In session a greater part of Uie day. and it is understood that their plans for reorgan izing the Senate committees are progress ing rapidly. CUBANS WELL PLEASED. The President's JIcsshkc Itecctveil AVIth Great Sntisftietion. HAVANA, Dec. C President McKinley's message to Congress has been received here with the greatest satisfaction, and the opinion is freely expressed that it will effectually quiet the Island. The Cuban revolutionary party is delighted, though somewhat surprised by what is considered the extreme clearness of the statements in regard to the future of Cuba. The "Patrla" says that President McKinlcy could not have spoken clearer. The message, it adds, is the echo of the joint resolution adopt ed by Congress. "It is impossible that the greatest nation in history, the founder ot true democracy, would stultify its past by overpowering a weaker race." "La Discusion" says tho message will fill the hearts of Cubans in spite of the miserable campaign that has been waged by some miserable people to persuade the United States to break its promises con tained in the joint resolution, which Pres ident McKinlcy has ratified. The convention of the Cuban League and National party has passed a vote of gen eral congratulation on account of the re cent mutual expressions of friendship on the part of Generals Gomez, Clsneros, and Lacret. A committee of forty members was elected by the convention to establish committees of the National party in places where they Imve not already been formed. The "Neuvo Pals' calls attention to the poor attendance of councilors at the meet ings of the municipalities. Mayor Lacoste says that the councilor, who are unpaid, all have to work for a living. Thougli they are willing to serve the public, they can not devote the time necessary for the quick despatch of business. Many matters, such as the Dady contract, need an extended ex amination of their details, all of which work costs tho public nothing. The mayor would like to sec fewer councilors, but would have them paid salaries. Four thousand Spaniards arrived here during the past week. 

LITTLE HOPE POR HORTON. I'lilcs the President Interferes He Ik to Die Krlilny. It was slated last night that in all prob ability the President would decline to in terfere with 'the execution of tbc law in the case of former Policeman George W. Horton, now under sentence of death at the District Jail. Notwithstanding this appar ent fact, the condemned man passed a quiet night. Ho displays remarkable nerve, the prison officials bay, and s-till appears to feel perfect confidence in the ability of his attorneys to ward off his impending fate. Last night the dea'th watch was estab lished over the murderer, and his every movement will be subject to scrutiny from now until the drop falls tomorrow morn ing. Preparations have been begun for the execution. The scaffold Is already in place, and but few details remain to be completed. A tst ot the ropes to be used in the ex ecution will be made today, and everything placed in readiness for the final moment. Permissions to witness the execution will be limited, it is said, to those required by law and members of tho press. They will bo issued by Warden Harris probably to day. The baby's coming is often looked for ward to as a time of dread and danger. Many women are physically unfit to be come mothers. They are sick and weak in a womanlv way and may well look with fear toward the time of maternity. Intelligent preparation for this time Is most essential. An athlete " trains " for months before his trial. Most women do not ' train " at all and yet their trial is to be fifty times as severe as the athlete's. During the period of gestation every woman should use every means to strengthen the organs that are to be tried. They should be kept in perfect health. The faintest symptom of dis order or disease should be promptly eliminated. Dr. Tierce's Favorite Prescription is designed to do this very thing has been doing it for over thirty years. It is the one sure medicine for all female com plaints, It is the only medicine that may be absolutely depended upon to practically abolish the pain and danger of childbirth. If is the only preparation of its kind that is the invention of a reg ularly graduated physician a skilled and experienced specialist in the cure of diseases of women. Mn, Emerson Allan, of Dorset, Ontario Co Ont., writes I was in very poor health for a long time dating from the birth of tnv little L'irl. I trieil different doctor and diflerent'mediciucs I took four bottles of ' Favorite Prescription aud seem to be perfectly well again."
