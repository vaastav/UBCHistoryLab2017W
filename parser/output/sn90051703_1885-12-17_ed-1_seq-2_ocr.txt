Jons W, Daniels (Democrat) -was elected United States senator by the Virginia legislature yesterday. The house of representatives have much difficulty in deciding upon the new rules. Better abolish rules al together and do some work. The Gou'd system of railroads is spreading itself all over Kansas. This is likely why the Frisco line is pull ing out west, in order to cut off the cattle business from the Gould roads. The Albuquerque Democrat is dis posed to find fault with the climate of Las Vegas. Our snow with fine calm days overhead beats the terri ble sand and wind storms of Albu querque a long ways. The El Paso Times describes the Rio Grande, in high water, as a roar ing, swift-running deluge that sweeps away bridges, railways, every thing in its path with a resistless fury. In low water, it is a brown trail of moist mud and sand. Fences fn government lauds in tie vicinity of Nepesta are all being taken down and the range thrown opon to all Much difference of opinion exists here ri'guidinx the validity of the leasts given by heirs of the Vigil and St. Vrain ijrant. Should thry prove a title to ' lands in dispute, all fenses now be'u g taken duwn will have to be replaced. Trinidad Advertiser. The Daily átate of Mew Orleans, under dato of December 10, has a column article on the exhihitsot Xew Mexico at the exposition. ' It is pro nounced much superior to the ex hibit made by New Mexico last year, and consists of a very fine display of the mineral products of the territory. Ores from nearly all the counties, specimens of building stone, over 200 mounted varieties of the native birds and a fine display of the native grasses and vegetables. Commis sioner Sloan has evidently been put ting in his time to some pur nose. President Cleveland's message Is being complimented every where. Even the Republican jour nals cau only carp and cavil at its length. The Washington corres pondent of the Kansas City Times says: The more ciitically the president's message is scanned and ana'yzed, the higher is the appreciation of its emi nence as a state paper. All concede at Washington, irrespective of party or individual opinions concerning public measures, that it evidence preat labor and careful thought in all essentials, and is therefore worthy to be placed side by side with any similar document emanating from the most distinguished of our presidents, The order has gone forth for the ex tension westward of the St. Louis & San Francisco railroad in the Indian territory. The western terminus of this road is now about 500 miles di rectly east of Las Vegas, and the surveyed route, principally up the Canadian valley, into this territory. The projected line leaves the Cana dian in the v'.cinity of Fort Bascom, and crosses over to the Pecos valley by Cabra springs and Gallinas spring8 in this county, and through Canon Viatico and Tijeras canon to the Rio Grande, connecting with the Atlantic fe Pacific at Isleta, some fifteen miles below Albuquerque. A branch will be constructed from the vicinity of Gallinas Springs to this city. It is understood that the construction of this road from Tulsa, its present ter minus, will bo pushed with great vigor to the west. This road will give Las Vegas an air line to the east. Ex-Congressman Sidney Clabk and Captain Crouch of the Oklahoma colonists, have prepared a compre hensive uiU tor the establishment of a territorial government, to inclu ide all that portion of the conntrv with in the limits of the Indian territory. and also what is now known as the public land strip north of the Pan handle of Texas. To settle all dis putes this bill was forwarded to Wash ington last night, and will be present- ed in both the house and senate at an early day. It contains twenty ques tions, and is framed with a view of reaching a prompt and just solution of all unsettled questions connected with the present anomalous condition of affairs in the Indian territory. It ial provides ior a complete territori government, and for all the iimm sary executive, judicial and legisla tive machinery. It is not proposed to interfere in any way with the In dians to whom land has been con veyed by absolute patent from the Vnited States, v Th White Oaks Road. Fr tn the El Paa Tl-rea. The movement t afUot recently in our city to make the much desired connection with tin coal fields cf White Oak, ha hrougot the Atchi son, Topeka fc Santa Fe people to the front. Telegrams have been re ceived by reliable parties here from Major Strong, president, and A. A. Robinson, general manager of the Atchison. Topeka fc banta Feroad, stating that they were on their way to El i'aso to make propositions for the building of the White Oaks road, and requesting a stay of proceed ings until they could be heard from. This announcement is very signifi cant, and it is difficult "to determine, or even guess, at the result which may spring from the complication. It will no doubt Htfect the present movement and check momentarily the favorable" influence ' which' the originitors of the enterprise had sue ceeded in gaining over tne commun ity by their well timed, energetical and business like exertions. They have secured already a strong xoot hold and it will cost the new com petition in the field some trouble to dislodge them from their point of vantage. ; " A storehouse belonging - to the Mojave Indians, situated on the bank of the Colorado riyer, opposite Fort Mojave, fell in a few days since, killing one Indian and severely in juring two others. The accident was caused by piling several tons of mes ouit beans and corn on the roof. The Indian who was killed was instantly placed on a couple of cords of wood and burned to 'ashes, after which the Indians proceeded to burn everything belonging to him, and to kill his horses and have a tig feast, which is their invariable custom when any of the tribe dies. $250 Reward.
