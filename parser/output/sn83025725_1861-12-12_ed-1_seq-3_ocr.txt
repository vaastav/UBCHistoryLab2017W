Furthermore, let these solemn protestations be carried to Washington by delegations of the most emi nent and influential citizens of the respective communities, and be urged upon the Jrrest dent with all the weight of exalted character and intelligence seconded by., the power of personal presence. Let the loyal men ef the South rise up as one man, and tell tne tr resi dent be knows not what he does.. Nor must the loyal men of. the North sit inactive. Let the enlightened journalists and speakers of the North set forth in a strong light the facts, first, tbat slavery is not the cause, but the mere pretext of tbe rebellion, and, secondly: that the policy of emancipation, if adopted by tbe administration, would render the bare physical suppression'of the. rebellion more difficult infinitely, while it would make the re-establishment of the Goverpmenf wholly impossible. .'A ..rv-.'n-.'A Let them point out the. transparent folly which lies at tne bottom on tnis cry tor ex treme measures, and bold up to view the im measurable folly and enormity of the cry Hy and enormity of the cry finer-intelligence- and- nobler northern masses be awakened itself. .-Let tbe impulses of tire into triumphant action by just and determin ed and universal appeals; and let tbe better J .
