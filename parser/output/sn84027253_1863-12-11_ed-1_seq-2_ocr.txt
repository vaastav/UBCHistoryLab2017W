WEEKLY JOURNAL. ORRIOIAL PAPKK or THK COUNT*. JOHN MAHIN, EDITOR. CITY OF MIIICATIinB. FRIDAY MORNING DEC. 11,1868. The MeMBffe. This important document was delirered to Congress Wednesday and reached us by tele graph in the evening Although some mistakes may hare been made by the operators and compositors, we think it will be found much freer from errors than is usual in such lengthy reports, which are generally put through in a hurry by operators and printers. At all events it reads sensibly, like all of President Lincoln's utterances. It dealt but little in argument, being mainly a plain and lucid statement of national affairs for the consideration of Congress. The proclamation of amnesty and recon struction is also plain and practical, and de cidedly opportune. fe^~Gen. Hurlbut has issued another order requiring all dealers in clothing to remove their stocks North. Since our occupation of Memphis, it has been of more value to the rebels than when it was held by the Confede racy. The men who follow the army to make money, are, to a very great extent, smugglers. This is the experience of Gens. Grant, Sherman, Hurlbut, and all other Gen. erals who have had commands in the South. Why is it, therefore, that the government does not adopt the policy of closing the lines, altogether, against trades. The great mass of those following our armies for money-making purposes don't care a button about the gov ernment, and they would sell to a rebel, for the use of the rebel army, quite as willingly, prices being equal, as to loyal men. At Yicksburg enough negro troops are now organized, with the help of the for tifications, to hold the place against all the the powers of the rebellion, even if every white man were withdrawn. Adjutant Gen eral Thomas expects that by Spring he will have enough negro troops to thoroughly guard and hold the Mississippi from Cairo to New Orleans. In this event all our white soldiers will be free to operate on other fields The prejudice which the soldiers had against the negroes as soldiers is rapidly passing sway, for they see them to be active, obedient and brave. A soldier is forced to respect a brave man all the world respect him. EP"A circular issued by Provost General Fry to the Provost Marshals directs that the State authorities adjust the quotas of the towns on the basis of quotas assigned to the districts by the Provost Marshal's depart ment and that in all cases a volunteer shall be credited to the town or district where he enlists, if his muster-in papers give the town or district as the place of his residence. In all cases where no place of residence is given the volunteer shall be credited to the Con* gressional District at large. One ground of the cessation of ex changes is the refusal of the rebels to exchange min for man. They insist on the release of all excess on parole, and, as they have broken their former paroles, we are not very likely to give them such a chance again. At a per sonal interview between Gen. Meredith and the rebel Commissioner Ould, held at the ex change of Surgeons, Gen. Meredith proposed to waive all disputed points, and exchange 16,0G0 prisoners. The proposition waa re fused. er The Copperhead papers are evidently running short of material for slanders. One of their last stories, started by the New Tork Day Book, is that the President's son, Rob ert, has made $500,000 as a Government contractor. The reasonableness of this de lightful fiction is shown by the fact that he is only about twenty years old, and was a student in Harvard College till July last Major W. S. Marshall of the 5th Iowa Infantry, and Captain Pickerell, Co. K, with the Adjutant, were taken prisoners by the rebels in the recent engagement of Sherman's division. The whole of Company A, and part of K, were captured, the latter being the color company. The 5th, when last heard from, were in the vicinity of Tuscumbia. [For the Muscatine Journal.] 

MUSCATINB, Dec. 8, IMS. EDITOR OF JOURNAL :—Will you allow me to say that I consider the objections you make to some things stated in my article the result cf misunderstanding, in part, of my state ment, as well as my disposition. In the first place I did not state that the President and his administration had been rebuked by the late elections, but on the contrary I said that the President having heeded the rebuke given him by the election of 1862, and having adopted the policy of freedom which the peo ple urged, that the late elections endorse that change with an Almighty voice. As to my disposition to take advantage of the Nation's necessities to raise the pay of private soldiers, I would ask what are the ne cessities of the Nation? Evidently not a want of money, for that has been furnished the government without stint or limit, and the North is claimed to be more prosperous than ever before. The great need is of men, and I simply recommend to use the money and prosperity to induce good men to fill up the rank and file of the army and I venture the assertion that the war cannot be prosecu ted to a successlul termination, without doing justice to private soldiers, by offering better inducements for that reason, I urge that it be done without delay. W. On closer inspection, we find that our cor respondent is right, and that we misunder stood, on hastily reading his article before it was put in type, what he said in reference to the verdict of the last election. We heartily agree with him in the desire to see our brave and self-sacrificing soldiers bet ter paid, but think it not right that recruit ing should be suspended till it is seen whether Congress will advance their pay.— We have the fullest confidence that their pay will be increased. Then let us do all in our power to fill up the ranks, in order to hasten the overthrow of the rebellion, trusting to the honor and wisdom of our rulers to do justice to the private soldier. 

EDITORIAL CONVKXTIOH.—The Desmoines Register moves that an editorial Convention be htid at Desmoines, which motion the Dav enport Gazette seconds and suggests JaBMiy 20th as the time. 'Nuff ced. Among the queer names recently drawn in Hartford, Conn., are "Constant Grinn," Depan Moses," and "A. Krack."— One man was exempted on account of "chron ic lipitudio," and another for chronic peri ostitis of tibia." An exchange expresses the hop* that the poor fellows have't got it very bad. iy |fske a kind of mortar of your aoal •sbe* and place upon th# fire when it is |»urnSif fiWr»tf700 to ««»oato»in Paitarlant montea, et aacltir ridiculuM mas." When we look at the "flourish of trum pets" before the ladies' convention at Des Moines and its results, the above line is forci bly suggested. At the convention at Musca tine an effort was made to induce all the sol diers' aid societies in the State to send their contributions by way of Davenport to the Northwestern Commission, at Ohicago.— Knowing that it would consume more time and money to send goods destined for the Lower Mississippi, by way of Chicago, they wisely refused, and resolved to send to St. Louis, letting all who preferred send to Chi cago. It was this refusal, and this alone, that led to the convention at Des Moines. There, by calling in the aid of men in high places to preside oyer and manipulate the machine, by appointing committees inimical to Mrs. Wit tenmyer,* (who operates entirely through the Western Commission, at St. Louis,) by brow-beating and refusing the floor to Mrs. W. and her friends, the same darling object was sought to be attained. What was the resalt? The convention, seeing the object of the Kynett faction and the folly of sending stores from Council Bluff's to Vicksburg by way of Chicago, refused, by a vote of one hundred and fifteen against forty-five, to stul tify themselves by such a suicidal course.— Having full confidence in both the Commis sions, they refused to make any invidious distinction. A fitting scathing rebuke to some would-be great men in Iowa. Truly their Herculean labor brought forth a ridicu lous mouse. But the convention was not entirely barren. Whereas, before Iowa had a State Sanitary Society, with Mrs. Wittenmyer for President and Miss Shelton for Secretary, and divers other officers from different parts of the State, and one even from Muscatine, the Nazareth of Iowa, now the has another Hermaphrodite Association, conceived and brought forth by a women's convention, with Hon. Judge Dillon (an honor to any station,) for President, and a "polished" though some what tortuous shaft in the Methodist Church and would-be Lieut. Col. in a certain cavalry regiment, lor secretary, and other officers, too tedious to mention, from other parts of the State, with Muscatine left out in the cold.— This may gratify some little mind. Well, the gratification is cheap let them enjoy it. The truly great and good of Iowa will continue to Ubor for the comfort of our sick and wound ed soldiers, and use Mrs. Wittenmyer or Mr. Kynett as agents for distribution, according to their elective affini'ies. A single fact from a hundred others will show the impression made on the minds of the people of Des Moines after having aid seeing the whole course of the two agents in the convention. While the one was suffered to leave unnoticed and ride all night in the cold with the driver rather than sit with and face the noble women who had stood by Mrs. W., she was pressed to remain and partake of a public dinner as a testimony of her worth and noble deeds. Intent on her godlike mis sion, and unwilling to do anything that might sow discord among brethren," this honor she declined. I see by the papers that the new organiza tion has met at Davenport and appointed three agents as evangelists to itinerate the State. One agent might be useful to stir up the people and organize societies where they do not exist, Do the old societies need the visits of such agents Will they teach the ladies how to cut out garments for the sick or to make wine and jellies for the convales cent Or what is their mission If they aim to compel all societies to patronize Davenport, their labor will be in vain. It is to be hoped that the Governor and Legislature will have too much sense to waste the money of the State on any such sinecures. 

ASTI-HCMBCO. •That the strictures on our honorable Senator who preside! over the meeting at Dee Moinee are 1nstf» Iowa Hews. —There are 350 students in the State Uni versity at Iowa City. —The two companies left over after filling up the 9th Iowa Cavalry are to be sent to old regiments. —The remaios of the late Col. Hughes, of the 38th regiment Iowa Infantry, were con veyed to Decorah a few days since for burial. Col. Hughes died at Port Hudson last sum mer of chronic diarrhea, and his corpse, al though enclosed in a metalic case, was refused transportation from Cairo during the warm weather. It was therefore buried at Cairo for the time, and lately taken up and brought home. —The Louisa County Musical Association will bold a convention at Wapello, commenc ing on Monday, the 28th inst., and continu ing until Friday evening, January 1st, at which time a concert will be given for the benefit of the soldiers' fund. Persons attend ing the convention, and taking part in the exercises, will be entertained free of expense. A general invitation to all interested in the science of vocal music is given to attend. AN 

INSIDE YIEW or THE SHELLING OF CHARLESTON.—A correspondent of the Augus ta (Ga.) Sentinel writes from Charleston as follows: About twenty-five 100-pound Parrott shells were flung into the city to-day. Old Gilmore scattered them promiscuously in the lower part of the city, and it really seemed from the way they were pi'ched about that he was trying to hit somebody. The City Hall build ing had a hole punched in one corner and some of the cornice knocked away. One struck the telegraph office, and the operators cut stick." One sma»hed through the roof of a house in Queen street, and several falling in this neighborhood the frightened denizens vamo«ed to the tune of the double quick. Several fell in the vicinity of the banks on Broad street and East Bay, tearing up the streets, smashing window panes and kicking up the mischief generally. One went crashing through the Mechanic's and Plant ters' Bank, and it is evident, I think, that Gilmore was after making a deposit. Wheth er he will bo regularly booked and his currency taken at par," is more than I can say. Several counting rooms on the wharves were slightly smashed, but, during the entire shelling, which lasted from about 9J to 1 o'clock, no one was hurt. A SOLDIER'S DEATH-BED.—Mr. Taylor, of the Chicago Journal, in one of his letters from Chattanooga, relates the following inci dent A soldier, fairly riddled with bullets, like one of those battle flags of Illinois, lay on a blanket gasping for breath. "Jemmy," said a comrade, and a friend before this crucl war began, with one arm swung up in a sling, and who was going home on a furlough, "Jemmy, what shall I tell them at home for you f" "Tell them," said he, "that there isn't hardly enough left of me to say 'I,' but—hold down here a minute—tell Kate there is enough left of me to love her till I die!" Jemmy got his furlough that night, and left the ranks for ever. {gTAmong the letters read at the National Convention of "Conservatives" at Cincinnati, last week, was one from "Hon. Gilbert O. Walker, of Illinois." This is our friend Gilbert C. Walker, a lawyer of this city, and a leader of the ''Democracy" here. It is of such men that the "Conservatives" ask coun sel and co-operation, and this fact indicates that what we said the other day is true, namely, that this "conservative" movement is merely a snare with which to catch gudgeons for the Democratic party. The so called "Constitution Union" party are nothing more or less than procurers (or the "Democracy." —Chicago Journal. President's Message. Fellow- Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: Another year of health and of sufficiently abundant harvests has passed. For these, and especially for the improved condition of our National affairs, our renewed and pro found gratitude to God is due. We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers. The efforts of disloyal citizens of the United Siates to involve us in foreign wars, to aid in inexcusable insunection, have been unavail able. Her Britannic Majesty's government, as was justly expected, have exercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from British ports. The Emperor of Fiance has, by a like proceeding, promptly indicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest.— Questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of the blockade and other bel ligerent operations between the government and several of the maratime powers, but they have been discussed, and, so tar as was possi ble, accommodated in a spirit of frankness and justice and mutual good will. It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by the im partiality of their adjudications, have com manded the respect and confidence ot mara time powers. Tns 

SLAVE TRADE. The supplemental treaty between the Uni ted States and Great Britain, for the sup pression of the African Slave trade, made on the 17th day of February last, has been du ly ratified and carried into execution. It is believed that so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that the in human and barbarous traffic has been brought to an end. CLAIMS IN WASHINGTON TERRITORY. I shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a conventton for the adjustment of certain claims in Washington Territory, arising out of the treaty of the 15 th of June, 1846, between the United States and Great Britain, and which has been the source of some disquiet among the citizens of the now rapidly improving part of the country. A QUESTION WITH SPAIN. A novel and important question, involving the extent of the maratime jurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the Is land of Cuba, has been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed, in an amicable spirit, to refer it to the arbitra ment of a friendly power. A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate. I have thought it a proper subject for the approval of the Senate, to confer with the interested commercial powers, in an arrange ment for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues, upon the principles which have been hereto fore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters of Denmark. SOUTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS. The long pending controversy between this Government and that of Chili touching the seizure at Silano, in Peru, by Chilian officers, of a large amount in treasure belonging to citi citizens of the United States, has been brought to a close by the award of his majesty, the King of the Belgians, to whose arbitrat on the question was referred by the parties. The subject was thoroughly and patiently exam ined by that justly respected magistrate.— Although the sum awarded to the claimants may have not been so large as they expected, there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of His Majesty's decision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chili when intel ligence in regard to it reached that country. The joint commission under the act of the last session of Congress for carrying into ef fect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims, has been organized at ma, and is engaged in the business entrusted to it. The difficulties concerning inter-oceanic tran sit through Nicaraugua are course of arnica ble adjustment in conformity with the prin ciples set forth in my last Annual Message. 1 havn received Representatives from the United States of Columbia, and have credited a minister to that Republic. THE RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY. is (trident from the beggarly vote of thanks for the im partial manner ID which he presided- 1 am informed that ft to nt a baker's dozen only voted in the afflrma* tive, and that if the negative had been put an over whelming No would have rent the room. Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of the international question touching the rights of foreigners i i this coun try, and of United States citizens abroad.— In regard to some governments these rights are at least partially defined by treaties. In no instance, however, is it expressly stipula ted that on the instance of civil war, a for eigner, residing in this country within the lines of the insurgents, is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a bellig erent, in whose behalf the Government of his country cannot expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character. I regret to say, however, that such claims have been put forward and in some instances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the United States the greater part of their lives. There is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries, who have declared their intent'on to become citizens, or who have become fully natural ized, have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the fact and then throwing upon the government the burden of proof. It has been difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof, from the want of guides to the proper sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts, when declarations of intention may be made or naturalization effected, to send, periodically, lists of the names of persons naturalized, or declaring their intention to be come citizens, to the Secretary of the Interior, in whose Department their names must be arranged and printed for general information. There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens of the United States for the sole purpose of evading the duties im posed by the laws of their native country, to which, on becoming naturalized here, they at once repair, and though never returning to the United States, they still claim the inter vention of the government as citizens. Many altercations and great prejudice have hereto fore arisen out of this abuse. It is, therefore, submitted to your serious consideration. It might be advisable to fix a lia it beyond which no citizen of the United States residing abroad may claim the interposition of his government. The right of suffrage has often been as sumed and exercised by aliens, under pre tense of naturalization, which they have dis avowed when drafted into the military service. I submit the expediency of such an amend ment to the laws as will m»ke the fact of vot ing an estoppal against plea of ex mption from military service or other obligation, on grounds of alienage. OUB 

RELATIONS WITH JAPAN. In common with other Western Powers, our relations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the aristocracy of the empire, to the enlightened and liberal policy designed to bring the country in'o the society of na tions. It is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these difficulties may be peacefully overcomo. I ask your attention to the minister residing there, for the damages he sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Yeddo. NATIONAL TELEGRAPHS. Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia which, it is be lieved, will result in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that Empire from our Pacific Coast. I recommend to your favor able consideration the subject of an inter national telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of a telegraph between this Capital and the National forts along the Atlantic Sea Board and the Gulf of Mexico. Such connec tions established with any reasonable outlay would be economical, as well as effective aids to diplomatic military and naval service. THB NEW CONSULAR SY-TEM. The Consular system of the Uoited States, under the enactments of the la-t Congress, begins to be self sustaining, and there is rea son to hope that it will be entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue when ever peace is restored. Our Ministers abroad have been faithful in defending American rights and protecting our commercial interests. Our Consuls have necessarily had to encoun ter increased labors and responsibilities grow ing out of the war. These they have, for the most part, met and discharged with zeal and efficiency. This acknowledgment justly inoludes those Consuls who, residing in Mo rocco, Egypt, China and other central coun tries, are charged with complications and extraordinary powers. TUB TERRITORIES. The condition of the several organised ter ritories is generally satisfactory, although the Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been entirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorodo, New Mexico, Idaho and Arizona are proviug far richer than heretofore understood. I lay be fore you a communication on this subject, from the Governor of New Mcxico. 1 again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encourage ment of immigration Although this source of National wealth is again followed with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred, there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry, and especially in agriculture and all our mines, as well of iron aud coal as of precious metals. While a demand for labor is thus increased here, tens of thousands of persous destitute of remunerative occupation are thronging our foreign Consulates and offering to emigrate to the United States if essential but very cheap assistance could be afforded them. It is easy to see that under the sharp dis cipline of a civil war the nation is beginning a new life. This noble effort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the government. Injuries unfor seen by the government, and unintended, may in some cases have been inflicted upon the subjects or citizens of foreign countries, both at sea and on land, by persons in the ser vice of the United States As this govern ment expects redress from other powers when such injuries are inflicted by persons in their service, on citizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners. If the existing judicial tribunals are inade quate to this purpose, a special Court may be author zed, with power to hear and decide such claims of the character refered to, as may have arisen under treaties and public law. Conventions for adjusting claims by your commission have been proposed to some governments, but no definite answers to the propositions have yet been received from any. In the course of the session I shall proba bly have ocasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been issued, and damages have been awarded by the Admiralty Court, and in other cases where this government may be acknowledged to be liable in princi ple, and when the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal arbitra tion. The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by the law of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign Consuls in this country. While such a demand may not be a violation of public law, or, perhaps, of any existing treaty between the United States and a foreign po .ver, the expediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from the in comes of such Consuls as are not citizens of the United States derived frt the emolu ments of their office or from property not situated in the Un-ted States, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make this sug gestion upon the ground that a courtesy which ou^ht to be reciprocated, exempts our Con suls in all other countries from taxations to the extent that is indicated. The United Stat°s, I think, ought not to be exceptionably illiberal to international trade and commerce. OPERATIONS OF THE TREASURY. The operations of the Treasury during the last year have been successfully conducted.— The enactment by Congress of a National Banking Law has proved a valuable support of the public credit, and the general legisla tion in relation to loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers. Some amendments may be required to perfect the existing laws, but no change in their princi pies or general scope is believed to be needed, Since these measures have been in operation all demands on the Treasury, including pay of the army and navy, ive been promptly met and fully satisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is believed, were ever more amply provided and more liberally and punc tually paid and it may be added, that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever more cheerfully and honorably borno, THE RECEIPTS DURING THE YEAR, From all sources, including loans and balance in the Treasury at the year's commencement, were $901,125,674.86. The aggregate dis bursements were $395,790,630.05. Leaving a balance on the 7th of July, 1863, of $5,329, 044.21. Of the receipts, there were derived from Customs, $09,059,642.40 from Inter nal Revenue, $40,764,787.95 from direct 'axes, $148,510,361 from lands, $167,617 17 from miscellaneous sources, $3,016,615. 35, and from loans, $7,760,823.61 making the aggregate $901,125,674.86. The disbursements were: $232,539.22 for pensions, &c. $4,216,526.59 for interest on public debt, and $24,729,846.51 for War De partment $599,298,600.83 for the Navy De partment $0,321,110,527 for the payment of funded and temporaiy debt, $1,818,063, 507 making an aggregate of |8,957,003,065, and leaving a balance of $532,904,421 but the payment of the funded and temporary debt having been made from monies borrow ed during the year, must be regarded as merely nominal payments, and the monies borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts, and their amount, $1,818,603,507, should, therefore, be deducted both from the receipts and disbursements. This being done, there remains, as actual receipts, $714, 709,995.58, leaving the balance as already stated. The actual receipts and disburse ments for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining thr e quarters of the current fiscal year of 1863 w 11 be shown in detail by the Secre'ary of the Treasury, to which I invite your at'en tion. It is sufficient to say here that it is not believed that the actual results wi 1 exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than those of that officer heretofore submitted, while it is confidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debts will be found very considerably less than has been anticipated. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR. The report of the Secretary of War is document of great interest. It consists in the first: the military operations of the year, detailed in the report of the General-in-Chief second, the organization of colored persons ujto the war service third, the exchange of prisoners fully set forth in the letter of Gen. Hitchcoi k the operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, detailed in the report of the Provost Marshal General fifth, the organization of the Inval id Corps, and sixth, the operations of the several departments of the Quartermaster General, Commissary General, Paymaster General, Chief of Engineers, Chief of Ord nance and Surgeon General. It has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report except such as would be too ex tended for this place, and hence I content myself with referring your attention to the report itself. THE NAVY. The duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been constantly increasing in efficiency as it has expanded. Yet, on so long a line, it has so far neen impossible to entirely suppress illicit trife. From the returns received at the NavyJBpartment, it appearj that more than l,0t'S^essels have been captured since the blocJ^rft was instituted, and that the value of the r'Yize-i already sent in for adjudication amounts to over $13,000,000. The naval force of the United States con sists at this time of 558 vessels completed and in course of construction. Of these sev enty-five are iron clad armored steamers.— The events of the war give an increased interest and importance to the navy, which will probably exter.d beyond the war itself. The aimored vessels in our navy completed and in service, or which are under contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed those of any other power but while these may be relied upon for harbor defense and sea coast survey, others of greater strength and capacity will be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our right- ful position on the ocean. The change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since the introduction of steam as a motive power for ships ef war, demands a corresponding change in some of our navy yards or the establishment of new ones for the construction and necessary repairs of modern war vessels. No inconsiderable em barrassments, delays and public injury has been experienced from the wi nt of some such Government establishment. The necessity of such a navy yard so furnished at come suitable placj ou the Atlantic seaboard has, on repeated occasions, been brought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is again pre sents to you in the report of the Secie tary which accompanies this communication. I think it my duty to invite your special attention to this subject and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval pur poses upon one of the western rivers. A na val force has been created on these interior waters and under many disadvantages, with in litle more than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present admin istration. As satisfactory and important as have been the performance of the heroic men of the navy at this interesting period, they are scarcely more wondorful than the services of our mechanics. Superior to any other na tion in our resources of iron and timber, with inexhaustable quantities of fuel in the imme diate vicinity of both and all available and in close proximity to navigable waters, without the advantage of public works, the resources of the nation have been de veloped and its power displayed in the con struction of a navy of such magnitude, which has, at the very period of its creation, rendered signal service to the Union. The increase of the number of seamen in the public service from 7,000 men in the spring of 1861 to about 24,000 at the present time, has been accomplished without especial legislation and extraordinary bounties to pro mote that increase. It has been found, how ever, that the operation of the draft for army recruits is beginning to affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if not corrected, be finely to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper vocation and in ducing them to enter the army. I therefore respectfully suggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval service by adequate provision on this subject,which would, too, be equitable to the community more especially interested. I recommend to your consid eration the suggextios of the Secretary of the Navy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen for the Naval service. The Naval Academy is rendering signal ser vice, in preparing midshipmen for highly re sponsible duties, which in after life they will be required to perform. In order that the country should not be deprived of educated officers, for which legal provision has been made at the Naval school, the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make nominations from States in insurrection, have been filled by the Secretary of the Navy. The school is now more full and complete than at any previous period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable consideration of Congress. 

POSTAL MATTERS. During the last fiscal year the financial condition of the Post Office Department has been one of increasing prosperity and I am gratified in being able to state that the re ceipts of postal revenue have nearly equalled the entire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,000 85, and the former to $11, 163,789 59, leaving a deficiency|of $15, 417 25. In I860, the year immediately pre ceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to $56,507,051 49. The postal receipts of that year are $2,645,722 19 less than thosi of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation has been only 25 per cent., but the annual expendi tures on account of the same has been re duced 25 per cent It is manifest, therefore, that the Post Office Department may become self-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the whole service. The inter national conference of postal delegates from the principal countries of Europe and Amer ica, which was called at the suggestion of the Postmaster General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last and concluded its deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles estab lished by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postal intercourse between nations and as the basis of future conventions inau gurate a general system of uniform interna tional charges at reduced rates of postage and cannot fail to produce benificial results. THE PUBLIC LANDS. I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior which is herewith laid before you for useful and varied information in re lation to public lnnds, Indian affairs, patents, pensions, and other matters of public concern pertaining to his Department. The quanti ty of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter cf the present fiscal year was 3,851,549 acres, of which 16,011 acres were sold for cash 1,456,514 acres were taken up under the homestead law, and the residue dis posed of under the law granting lands for military bounties, for railroad and other purposes. It also appears that the salo of public lands is largely on the increase. It has long been a cherished opinion of some of 0 .r wisest statesmen that the people of the United States had a higher and more endear ing interest in the early settlement and sub stantial cultivation of the public lands, than jn the amount of direct revenue to be de rived from the sale of them. This opinion has had a controlling influen e in shaping legis tion on the subject of our national domain. 1 may cite as evidence of this, the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual set tlers, in the grant to the States of the over flowed lands within their limits in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation. The grants to railroad com panies of alternate sections of land upon the contemplated lines of their road, when completed, will, too, large ly multiply the facilities for reviewing our distant possessions. This policy has received its most signal and beneficial illustration in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual settlers. Since the first of January ltst, the before-mentioned quantity of one million four hundred and fifiy-six thousand five hundred and fourteen acres of land has been taken up under its provision. This fact, and the amount of Bales, furnish gratifying evidence of increasing settlement upon public lands, notwithstanding the great stiuggle in which the energies of the nation have en gaged and has required so large withdrawal of our citizens from their accus omed pursuits. I accordingly concur in the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, suggesting a modification of the act in favor of those en gaged in the military and naval service of the United State3. I doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will, without essentially changing the general fea tures of the system, secure the greatest prac ticable extent of its benefits to those who have left their homes in defense of the coun try in this arduous cris s. I invite your attention to the views of the Secretary of War as to the propriety of rais ing, by appropriation or legislation, a revenue from the mineral lands of the United States. 

INDIAN AFFAIRS. The measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain Indian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been negotiated, which will, in due time, be submitted for the constitutional action of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the possessor's rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of land. It is hoped that the effecting of these treat ies will result in the establishment of a per manent friendly relation with such of these tribes as have been brought into frequent and bloody collisions with our outlying settle ments and emigrants. Sound policy, and our imperative duty to these wards of the Government, demand our anxious and con stant attention to their material well-being— to their progress in the arts of civilization, and above all to that moral training, which, under the blessing of Divine Providence, will confer upon them the elevating and sanctify ing influences of the Christian faith. I suggested, in my last annual message, the propriety of remodeling our Indian sys tem. Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity. The details set forth in the re­ port of the Secretary will evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action. I commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the government this District, to your serious and fostering re. NATIONAL SIIIP CANAL. The attention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some extent with a proposition for the enlargement of the water communications between the Mississippi riv er and the North Eastern seaboard, which pr position, however, failed for the time. Since then, upon a eall of the greatest respec tability, a convention has been called at Chicago upon the same subject, a summary of whose views is contained in a mem trial addressad to the President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay before you. That this interest is one which ere long wi 1 force its own way, I do not entertain a doubt. While it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done, new importance is given to this subject by the ac tual commencement of work upon the Pacif ic railroad, uuder auspices so favorable to its rapid progress and completion. Enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road. I transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the Department of Agricul ture, asking your attention to tho develop ments in that vital interest of the nation. TUB 

EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. When Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted twenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea with varying results. The rebellion has been pressed back into reduced limits, yet the tide of public feeling and opinion at home and abroad, was not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections, then just passed, indicated uneasiness among our selves, while amid much that was cold and menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accents of pity, that we were too blind to surrender our commerce, which was suffering from a few armed vessels, built upon and furnished from foreign shores, and were threatened with such additions from some quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from European Govern ments anything hopeful upon this subject. The Emancipation Proclamation, which was issued in the month of September, was running its assigned period to the beginning of the New Year, when a month later, the first succeeding the proclamation of emancipation the announcement that colored men would be received into war service—the policy of emancipation and employing black soldiers— gave to the future a new aspect, about which hope, fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict. According to our political system,as a matter of civil administration, the general government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any State. For a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a mili t»ry measure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and if it should the crisis of the contest would th. n be presented. It came, and, as was ex pected, it was followed by dark and doubtful days. —Eleven months have passed. We are permitted to take another review. The rebel borders are pressed still further back, and by the complete opening of the Missis sissippi River, the country dominated over by the rebellion is divided into distant parts, with practically no communication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been so substantially cleared of insurgents' con trol and intluence, that the citizens of each and owners of slaves and advocates of slave ry in the beginning of the rebellion, now de clare openly for emancipation in their respec tive States. Of those States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation are Maryland and Missouri, neither of which years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into the territories, only dispute now as to the best mode of removing within their own limits those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion. Full 100,000 are now in tho United States military service, about ono half of which number actuary bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men. So far as tested it is difficult to say that they are not as good sol diers as any. No servile insurrection or ten dency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of emancipating and arming the blacks. These measures have been much discussed in foreign countries,and cotempora ry with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved at home the satne measures have been fully discussed, supported, criticised and denounced, and the annual elections following are highly encour aging to those whose special duty is to guide the country through this great trial. Thus we believe the crisis which threatened to di vide the friends of tho Union is passed. A PROCLAMATION OF AMNESTY. Looking now to the present and future,and with reference to a resumption of na tional authority in States whero its authority has been suspended, I have thought best to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted anl examination of which proclamation, it will appear, it is believed, amply justified by the Constitution. The form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it—a man is only promised a pardon in case he voluntari ly takes the oath the Constitution author izes the Executive to grant, on terms as is fully established by the judicial and other authorities. It also proffers that if in| any of the States named, the seat of Government shall be determined in the mode prescribed to s°t up such Government, it shall be recog nized and guaranteed by the United States, and th it under it and the Constitution the State shall be proteoted against invasion and domestic violence. The Constitutional obli gation of the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of Government, and to protect the State in the crses stated, is explicit and full. But why tender this provision only to a State Govern ment set up in this particular way This section of the Constitu ion contemplates a case when in the element within a State fa vorable to a Republican Government in the Union may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to and even wi'.hin the Stale, and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing. An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived Govern ment, constructed in whole or preponderating part from the very element against whose hostility and ma'evolence it is to be protect ed, is simply absurd, l'here must be a test by which to separate opposing elements so as to build only from the sound, and that test a sufficiently liberal one to account each one sound who will subscribe to a sworn state ment of his former unsoundness. But if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, and Union under it, why not, also, to the laws and proclamations in regard to slavery These laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aid ing tho suppression of the rebellion. To give their fullest effect, there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my judgment they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were enlisted. To give up this principle would be not only to relin quish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and astounding breach of faith. I may add at this point, that while I remain in my present position I will not attempt to retract or modify the Emancipation Proclamatirn, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of the proclamation, or by any act of Congress. For these and other reasons, it is thought best that the support of these persons shall be included in the o'th, and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim in return for pardon and res toration of projected rights, which he has clear Constitutional power to withhold al together, or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public interest. It should be observed also, that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abroga ting power of tha Legislature and Supreme judicid decision. The proposed acquiescence of the national executive in any honorable temporary State arrangement for the purpose is made with the yiew of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States. It is hoped that tho already deeply afflicted people in those States may be somewhat more icady to give np the cause of their a(ll ction, and to this extent this vital matter is left to them selves while no power of the national execu tive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition. Th) suggestion in the proclama tion as to maintaining the political frame work of the States, in what is ca'led recon struction, is made in the hope it may do good,without the danger of harm—that it will save labor, and also avoid great confusion. But why any proclamation upon this sub ject This qutstion is beset with the con flicting views that the ste might be delayed too long or be taken too soon in some ele ments for resumption, seem ready for action but remain inactive, apparently for want of a rallying point—a plan of action. Why shall we adopt the plan of A rather than that of If A and should agree, how can they know but the General Government here will respect their plan By the Proclamation a plan is presented which can be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would. The objection to a prema ture presentation of a plan by the National Executive consists in the danger of com mittal in points which could be more safely left to further developments. Care has been taken to so phrase the document as to avoid embarrassment from this source. In saying that on certain terms certain classes will be pardoned, with their rights re stored, it is not said that other classes on other terms will ever be included. In saying a re-coLStruction will be accepted if present ed in a specified time, it is not said it will never be accepted in any other way. The movements in State action in emanci pation in several of the States not included in the emancipation proclamation arc matters of profound gratification, and while I do not re peat in detail what I have heretofore so urg ently urged upon this subject, my general views and feelings continue unchanged, and I trust Congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to the great consummation. 

CONCLUSION. In the midst of other cares, however im portant, we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our maintenance, and to that power alone can we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in contested regions, that the insurgent power will not again overrun them. Until that con fidence can be established, little can be done anywhere for what is called reconstruction. However, our chief care must still be direct ed to our army and navy who have borne their part so well, and it may be esteemed fortunate that in giving the greatest efficien cy to these indispensable arms we do also honorably encourage gallant men, from com mander to sentinel, who compose them, to whom, more than to all others, the world stands indebted for the home of freedom dis enthralled, regenerated, enlarged and perpet uated. ABRAHAM LINCOLN December 8,1863. The following proclamation is appended to the message PROCLAMATION. WHEREAS, in and by the constitu'ion of the United States, it is provided that the President shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment and whereas a rebellion now exists whereby the legal States and governments of several States have for a long time been subverted, and many persons have committed, and are now guilty of, treason against the United States and whereas, with reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been enacted by Congress, causing the forfeiture and con fiscation of property, and liberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated, and also declaring that the President was thereby authorized, at any time thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebel lion, in any State and part thereof, paruon and amnesty with such exceptions and at such terms and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare and, whereas, the congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon accords with well established judicial expositions of the pardoning power and, whereas, with refer ence to said rebellion, the President of the United States has issued several proclama tions with provisions in regard to the libera tion of slaves and, whereas, it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion, to resume their allegiance to the United States and re-inaugurate loyal State governments within and for their respective States: therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the Uni ted States, do proclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have directly or by implication participated in the existing rebel lion, except as hereinafter stated that a full pardon is granted to them, and each of them, with a restoration of all rights, if no third parties shall have intervened, and upon the condition that such person shall take and sub scribe an oath and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath will be registered for permanent preservation, and shall be of the tenor and effect following, to-wit: 111 do solemnly swear in presence of Al mighty God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the Union of States thereunder, that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed during the existing rebellion, with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not re pealed, modified or held void by Congress or iy decision of the Supreme Court, and that I will in like manner abide: by and fiithfully support all proclamations of the President made during the existing rebellion, having reference to slavery, so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of the Supreme Court, so help me God." The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing rovisions arc all who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the so called Confederate Govern ment, all who have left judic al stations under the United States to aid the rebellion, all who are or who shall have been naval or military officers, of the rank of colonel in the army or lieutenant in the navy, or who left seats in the United States Congress to aid the rebel lion, all who resigned their commissions in the army or navy of the United States «nd afterward aided the rebellion, and all who have been engaged in tieating colored per sons and white prisoners in charge of such otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war and which persons may be found in the United States servicers soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity. I do further proclaim, declare apd make known, that whenever in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Al abama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina, a number of persons, not less than one tenth of the number of votes cast in each Sta e at the Presidential el ction of the year of our Lord I860, each having taken the oath aforesaid and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter by the election laws of the State immediately before the so-called act of secession and excluding all others, shall have established a State gov ernment which shall be republican and in no wise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and the United States will receive them under the benefits of the constitutional provision, which declares that the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion, on application of tho Legislature, or the Executive when the Legislature cannot be convened, against domestic violence. Secondly, I do further proclaim, declare and make known, that any provision which may be adopted by such State government, in relation to the freed people of such State, which shall recognize and declaro their per manent freedom, and provide for their educa tion, and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement, with their present condition as a laboring, landless and home less classes, will not be objected to by tho national executive and it is suggested as not Jundary,thatinsubdivisions, proper in constructing a legal State pernment any State, the name, the the the constitution, and the Federal code of laws, as before the rebellion, be maintained, subject only to tho modifications made necessary by the condi tions hereinbefore s'ated, and such others, if any, not contravening such conditions, which uiav be deemed expedient by these forming the new State government. To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation, so far as it relates to Statu governments, has no refer ence to States wherein the loyal State Govern ments have all the while been maintained, and fo the same reason it tuay be proper to further say, that whether members sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted to a seat, rests exclusively with the respective Houses and not to any extent with the Ex ecutive, and still further, that this procla mation is intended to present to the people of the States wherein the national authority has been suspended and the loyal State governments have been subverted, mode by which the national authority over every loyal State government may be estab lished within all of said States or any of them, and while the mode presented is the best the executive can suggest with his pres ent impression, it must not be understood that another possible mode would not be ac cepted. Given under my hand, at the City of Washington, this 8th day of December, A. D. 1863, and of the Independence of the United States the Eighty-eighth. 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN. By the President: WM: H. SEWARD, Sec'y of State. Newi Paru«ra| Ii4. A mansion, completely furnished, was presented to Bishop Simpson, of the Metho dist Church, in Philadelphia, on Thanksgiv ing Day. Major D. R. Rushncll, of the 13 th Illinois volunteers, was killed by a eharpshooter at Ringgold Station, south of Chattanooga, on the 27th ultimo. He was from Sterling, 111. Ohio stands an excellent chance of furnish ing nearly her whole quota by draft. Only about 2,000 volunteers have been mustered in since the call was made, leaving 27,000 men to be furnished on the 5th of January, if not before. The Heenan and King fight, which is. to take place in England next month, for a poise of £2,000, is the all-absorbing topic among the sporting men. The final deposit cfi.'100 a side is yet to be made. Both men are in active training. Capt. Streeter, of Medina, Ohio, was tried last week on the charge of murdering a whole family by the name of McCoy last fall, rob bing the house, and setting fire to it to hide his guilt. lie was found guilty of the hor rible deed, and was sentenced to be hung on the 26th of February next. The guerrilla ravages along the Mississippi line are now checked. All boats will go armed, and the gunboats in large numbers, are crui«ing on the river. In Arkansas the guerrillas are committing their depredations among loyal Indians, and a considerable force of them are threatening Gen. McNeil. The losses of cattle by starvation in the southern counties of California, on account of the unusual dry season, is estimated at over 15,000, and many more were killed to save the bide.s and tallow. The recent rains have started vegetation, so that stock may com mence recruiting. At the recent Sunnyside disaster on tho Mississippi, a man swam up to a woman who, together with her child, was struggling with the waves, and said, "I can save one of you, whi-h Save my daughter," said the mother, and the daughter was saved and lives as a witness to the unselfishnoss of a mother's love. The copperhead rioters at Carbon, Pa., haxe come to grief. One hundred of them are now in custody for opposition to the Gov ernment, resisting the draft, incendiarism, murder, and other little copperhead pecca dilloes. Some nine of them are implicated in the murder of Mr. Smith, and various acts of incendiarism. The 12th Illinois, cavalry numbering 583 officers and men, have re-enlisted, their term of service havingjust expired The men were allowed thirty days furlough to visit their homes. The citizens of Chicago gave the 12th a brilliant reception last Saturday.— This regiment has been in service on the Po tomac. General Butler, while witnessing the re view of a number of regiments at Old Point just after his arrival, was much astonished to see among the spectators a rebel general offi cer, and inquired of one of the bystanders who it was. He was answered "General Fitzhugh Lee." It will be remembered that Fitzhugh made a trip to Fort Lafayette im mediately after. A lard tank exploded in the picking house of Griswold & Talcott, Chicago, on Thursday last. The tank was blown through a four teen-inch stone wa'l, a distance of four hun dred feet, falling through the roof of another establishment of the same sort Besides this feat, the building it occupied was completely destroyed by the force of the explosion.— Fortunately, only one person was injured, and he but slightly scalded. It is a fact that one night during the ad vance of Hooker's comman 1 upon the enemy at Lookout Mountain a stampede of about thirty mules took place from our command.— They rushed through the picket lines of both armies into the enemy's camp, causing them to retreat in confusion, imagining the Federal cavalry to be making a dash upon them. An entire brigade was thus driven back upon the main body of the rebel army, leaving about 1500 stand of arms on the ground, which were captured by a party of our men sent out to bring in th-j mules. The -'Midnight Charge of the Mule Brigade" is worthy of a niche in the history of this war. §3^" A characteristic story of the President is narrated in a letter from Washington.— When the telegram from Cumberland Gap reached Mr. Lincoln that "firing was heard in the direction of Knoxville," he remarked that he was "slad of it." Some person present, who had the perils of Burnside's position up permost in his mind, could not see why Mr. Lincoln should be "glad of it," and so expressed himself. "Why, you see," re sponded the President, "it reminds me of Mistress Sallie Ward, a neighbor of mine, who had a very large family. Occasionally one of her numerous progeny would be heard crying in some out of-way place, upon which Mis tress Sallie would exclaim, "Thcie's one of my children that isn't dead yet!" English "society" is very much excited just now by a scandal case in very high life—the subject being no less a person than Lord Pal merston, Her Majesty's Premier, who only a short time ago celebrated his eightieth birth bay. Somebody— one report says an ex Cap tain of the British army, and others say a clergyman named O'Kane—has instituted a suit of divorce against his wife, on a charge of adultery with the "noble Lord,'' and claim ing of him one hundred thousand dollars dam ages. Ne*rly all the last London papers refer to this scandal, and admit the fact of the suit. Lord Palmers ton has refused to compromise the matter. The affair is agitating ail Kng antt. *nr" HE
