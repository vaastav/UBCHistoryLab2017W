It shall be my aim to continue abso lutely unbroken the policy of Presi dent McKinley for the peace and pros perity and honor of our beloved coun try.-President Roosevelt. a ROOSEVELT'S FIRST MESSAGE. Vigorous in style and conserva- n tive in utterance, President Roose. tl velt's first message to congress is d an admirable state paper. The w necromancers who predicted a g short message didn't know what they were talking about, for the s paper is a voluminous document, ti fully.as lengthy as the average run d of such papers, and requires twen- s ty columns of an ordinary news- o paper to give the full text. u From a literary point of view t the message is somewhat above ti the average and gives evidence of s: having been written by the presi- ii dent himself. It is clear and con cise and omits the dry details of s department summaries. As a gen- a eral thing the messages of presi- r dents to congress are not very d widely readl, but it is safe to say s that the one presented to the sen- o ate and house last Tuesday will J receive more than passing notice from the reading public at large. Aside from the excellent and pat- t, riotic recomnmendations which it N makes, the message commands at- a tention by reason of its literary I merit. It is an intensely interest- t ing public document. There isn't I .a dry line in the entire composi- s tion. Though somewhat strenu- s ous in spots, it is not radical, but r a wise, statesmanlike presentation r of the conditions of the country t and a splendid exponent of nation- 1 at affairs. It devotes much space to the subject of anarchy and as serts that "w'ealth was not struck 1 .at when the president was assas- s sinated;" that "the blow was not a .aimed at tyranny or wealth." but f "at one of the strongest c'hampions a that the wageworker has ever had; at one of the most faithful repre- s sentatives of the system of public t rights and representative govern- C ment who has ever risen to public , office." The message asserts that the man who advocates anarchy or apologizes for its believers and their deeds makes himself morally accessory to murder before the fact. It is well said that the an archist's protest of concern for workingmen is outrageous in its impudent falsity. In relation to the question of trusts the message takes the ground that they should be controlled by some sort of federal legislation, but that great discretion should be exercised in dealing with combina. tions of capital, lest in an attempt to regulate the trust evil the busi ness interests of the country should be irreparably damaged and a panic produced. The message favors the immedi ate reenactment of the Chinese ex clusion law and favors legislation 4 whereby the eight-hour law shall be put into practical effect in all governmental contracts. Presi dent Roosevelt takes a firm stand in the interests. of the wageworker and states that the government should provide in its contract that all work should be done under. "fair" conditions. There is nothing in the message indicating that the president is not heartily in favor of the pro tective tariff as it now exists. In deed, his expressions on this im portant question evidence the fact that he is unalterably opposed to any "tariff tinkering," either through a direct lowering of the duties or by the operations of re Sciprocity. It is his opinion that = reciprocity should be treated as the handmaiden of protection and that duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The message takes account of the existence and the splendid pos sibilities of the west. It advocates and emphasizes the necessity for governmental aid in reclaiminig arid lands and says that the west ern half of the United States - would sustain a population greater than that of the whole country to s day if the waters that now run to e waste were saved and used for irri E gation. t The message favors the con e struction, without delay, of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines. It i declares that the Monroe doctrine should be the cardinal feature of our foreign policy. It favors the upbuilding and the extension of v the United States navy, but takes e the ground that there is no neces f sity for any increase in the stand - ing army. Many other important national f subjects are extensively treated, - and as a whole the message will rank well with those historical y documents presented by such able ' statesmen and conservative, patri - otic presidents as Washington, I Jefferson, Lincoln and McKinley. a A new treaty to replace the Clay- b ton-Bulwer treaty was signed in 1 Washington a few days ago. It will be known in history as the Hay-Ponceforte treaty and gives 11 the United States control of the ii Isthmian canal. The treaty as signed also replaces one by the same envoys which was recently ij rejccte(d by the senate. This gets 1 rid of a cause of disquiet between this country and England and will 1be welcome to both countries. (1 Secretary Long of the navy is in bad odor with the American Peace society by his recommendation of 1 an appropriation of $100,000,000 for new warships and supplies. Secretory Long is a prominent memlber of the society. but the society has entered a protest never- s theless. The secretary's idea of cowing and not coddling an enemy will be more acceptable to the county thain to the honoralle peace c society. One by one the governlments of the world are adopting the single t gold standard. Even poor, old, de crepit Spain has finally awakened to the necessity of doing away with the monstrous heresies of the free and unlimited coinage of the white metal. Only the other day the Spanish senate passed a bill to a prohibit silver coinage, thus tak-I ing a step forward in the proces sion of human progress. American railway magnates are invading Germany and gaining control of German lines. The Ger mans have become so badly fright ened that Emperor William has called a conference on the subject. I The Kaiser needn't think he can I get rid of us by barring our hogs. Twelve deer hunters have been shot in the Adirondacks since the hunting season opened. It is al most as dangerous to be a deer [ hunter there as a convict hunter in Kansas, 1 Senator 1Hale is right when he says the kind of reciprocity this country needs is that reciprocity which "gives to our country the products we do not produce in ex change for the products of other countries which they do not pro duce." Judge Thompson, of Illinois, who added $10,000,000 to the Chi cago tax duplicate at one fell swoop, has clinched his decision by ordering the equalization board to report to him whether they have obeyed the mandate of his court. There are 1,800,000 more males than females in the United States. This ought to be encouraging to the old maids and cause them to get up at midnight and look under the bed. It may be admitte(d that Oom Paul was no slouch of a prophet when he.said the Boer war would staggar humanity. It has given the British lion the blind staggers. An encouraging sign of the times in Russia is the fact that the bud get for educational purposes will be increased 4,000,00() roubles the coining year. Colonel Gus Rublin was not knocked out i)adly enough nor often enough to entitle him to start a weakly newspaper. Having pulled down her Vest. it will now be in order for Missou ri to "wipe off her chin" and salute the flag. There seems to be a conspiracy among bank tellers: cashiers and f bank burglars to reduce the sur- r plus. If anybody knows what has hap pened to Miss Stone, and who (lid it, he will please rise to his feet. The republic of Columbia is hav ing the annual disturbance, called by courtesy a revolution. It's always safe to praise the dead. It never encourages them to strike you for a loan. The democratic spitz has ceased harking at the car of progress. He is nursing his wounds. John Bull has asked his Canuck subjects to come over into South Africa and help him. Whenever an Arkansas governor cannot govern a subject he goes after him with a gun. When our British cousins raised the taxes they raised something else also. Those Leavenworth Boers are still out among the kopjes. Big Horn County News: J. A. Virtue I and wife left Thursday morning for the home of Charles Dodge, where they will' visit for a day or two, after which they will leave for their home in Red Lodge.
