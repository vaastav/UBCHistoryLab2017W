WILSON’S MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS Senate and House in Joint Ses sion Hear Address of the President. HE HAKES FEW SUGGESTIONS Further Legislation for Settlement and Regulation of Railway Labor Dis putes Held Imperatively Neces sary by the chief Magistrate. Washington, Dec. s.—The senate and house met in joint session today and heard President Wilson’s message, which was as follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me hy the Constitution of com- j munlcating to you from time to time Information of the state of the Union and recommending to your considera tion such legislative measures as may he judged necessary and expedient • 1 shall continue the practice, which I hope lias been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of Ihe public service and confine myself to those matters of more general pub lic policy with which it seems neces sary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug gestions as few as possible; hut there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now he time to complete and which it seems necessary In the interest of the public to do at once. Tn the first place, It seems to me Im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in view of the pub lic dangers disclosed hy tlie unaccom modated difficulties which then existed, and which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended: First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied in the hill recently passed hy the house of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate; in order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon it with a prompt ness and thoroughness which are, with its present constitution and means of action, practically impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages In the employ ment of all railway employees who are actually engaged in the work of oper ating trains in interstate transporta tion. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment hy the president of a small body of men t<> observe tlie actual re sults in experience of the adoption of tin* eight-hour day in railway trans portation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval hy the con gress of the consideration hy the in terstate commerce commission of an increase of freight ratgs to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads ns may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which havevnot been off set by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed justify the increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for tlie mediation, conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, incase the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall he instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment in the hands of the executive of the power, in case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and snob roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials as the eircumstanoes require for their safe and efficient use. Renews His Recommendations. The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress immediate ly acted on: it established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wages in train service and it au thorized the appointment of a com mission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most Immediately needed; Unusual Experience. “Man.*’ remarked Sandy, “I did a thins: last nicht what I’ve no dune this twenty year. T went to uta bed pairr fectl\ sober, but I'm richt thankful to say I got up this inornln’ none the waur!” Few Beggars in Panama.

Steele in “Doctor Nick.” Its Limitations. “You can't make a bluff with an umbrella.” “Why not?” “Because you must either put up or shut up.” hut it postpone! action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate con sideration of them. The fourth rec ommendation I do not deem it neces sary to renew. The power of the in terstate commerce commission to grant an increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to -draw in question the scope of the com mission’s authority or Its inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions —the increase in the interstate commerce commis sion’s membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity—l now very earnestly rgnew. The necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing. Those who have intrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them in such matters would find it hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does the interstate com merce commission now find it practi cally Impossible, with its present mem bership and organization, to perform its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected us an administrative instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the increase in the effi ciency of the interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives lias already acted; its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should 1 make it, that any man in any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue in an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in do ing so would be to adopt anew prin ciple into our jurisprudence wliieTi I take it for granted we are not prepared to introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the in dustrial processes of the nation, at any rate before ilie nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of (he case as between em ployee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider all practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition But the justifiable safeguarding by so lely of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbi trary or unjust in it unless it be arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupu lous regard for the interests and liber ties of all concerned as well as for the permanent interests of society itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in pro moting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the lawsf against monopoly ; the bill amending the present organic law of Porto Rico; and the bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, com monly called the Corrupt Practices Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies in the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces sary. Even delay would seriously jeopard the Interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill'to reg- Most Fishermen Have Done It. “Simple Simon went a-fishing in his mother’s pail.” “Not so simple, at that.” declared the amateur sportsman. “I’ve spent time and money getting to a place where the likelihood of catching fish was no whit greater.” Nothing New. *T see some scientific sharp has dis covered a substitute for bread.” “He needn’t think he’s so much. Our cook has been turning that out for years.” Proofs of True Love. Grace (sobbing)—"You don’t love me!

Flaw in His Honesty. “Honesty is the best policy,” but he who acts on that principle is not an honest man.—Archbishop Whately. ulnte the expenditure of money in elec tions may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer; be cause at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral offices are to be filled ; but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied In the light of present experience; and a delay would have the further very se rious disadvantage of postponing ac tion until another election was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. 1 shall not argue at length the desir ability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume, has indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary instrumen talities for its prosecution; it is deemed to he doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must he done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Needs. The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning.them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you in the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor in such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion ht a record of rare serviceableness and distinction. Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite. Instead of an ax and saw to remove the tops of trees that are to be used as masts in logging operations, dyna mite is used to shoot off the tops. After the branches have been removed, n rigger climbs the tree, with a set of irons, to the point where it is neces sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk is usually about 12 inches in diame ter. The rigger ties a string of dyna mite cartridges, fastened end to end like sausages, around the trunk at this point, inserts a blasting cap with about 20 feet of fuse in one of these sticks, lights the end of the fuse, and de scends before the explosion takes place. The tree top pumps into the air with the explosion and the trunk is left ready for attaching the rigging for dragging in and loading the logs. —Engineering Record. All He Saw of Battle.

WATERTOWN WEEKLY LEADER, WATERTOWN, WIS. PLANS FIGHT TO MAKE STATE DSYi New Madison Legislator Pre pares to Open Battle in Coming Session. PROPOSES REFERENDUM VOTE Bill to Be Introduced Will Provide for Submission of Question at the General Election in 1918. Madison—That a hot battle is going to be waged at the coining session of the legislature on the liquor question was intimated when William T. Evjue, newly elected member of the assembly from this district, announced that he would introduce a bill providing for a state-wide referendum in Wisconsin. The bill will provide Tor the submis sion of the question for the abolish ment of the liquor business in Wiscon sin to a vote of the people at the gen eral election to be held in November, 1918, In the event of the ratification of the bill by the people of the state it is proposed that the law shall go into effect either in July. 1919, or Jan uary 1, 1920. “At the coming session of the legis lature I shall introduce a bill provid ing that the question of state-wide pro hibition be submitted to a vote of the people at the general election in No vember. 1918,” said Mr. Evjue. “By having this held at the general elec tion in November it can be conducted at little expense. Every state around Wisconsin is making headway on this proposition and if this state is going to continue to be known as progressive it must not lag behind such states as Michigan. Minnesota, lowa and Illi nois. Michigan has just gone dry by a referendum vote by a majority of 70,000. lowa is dry. It is very prob able that the Minnesota legislature will take action this winter which will make that state dry. “I have chosen a referendum plan as the most suitable one to introduce at the coming session because I do not see how any member of the legislature can consistently oppose any plan that would give the people of Wisconsin a chance to settle this question for themselves. Even those members of the legislature inclined to be wet can not deny the citizens of Wisconsin a chance to vote on the proposition. “While the present legislature is wet, there is going to be a good fight ing chance to get a referendum meas ure through.” Mr. Evjue was elected from the Madison district after a hard fight against him by the liquor interests. He won out in a three-cornered fight by the largest plurality ever given a can didate in this district. He is business manager of the Wisconsin State Jour nal. He was born in Merrill and prior to coming to Madison was engaged in the newspaper business in Milwaukee and Chicago. It is reported that William Jennings Bryan will come to Madison during the session of the legislature and that a big mass meeting will be held at the gym nasium in the interests of the Evjue bill. New Forestry Law Sought. A state-wide forestry law that will give to the conservation commission management of the state lands, so far as the constitution will permit, and otherwise simplify and harmonize the statutes relating to forestry land and state parks is proposed by the conser vation commission in its report to Gov ernor Philipp. Authority is asked to sell such forest reserve lands as are suitable for agriculture to purposes settlers, not more than 100 acres to one individual, also scattering tracts of state land. Continuation of the pol icy of building state roads in the state ■ parks is asked and an appropriation i of $40,000 for the purchase of the re- I raaining of the interior holdings with i in the Devil’s lake and peninsula ! parks. A long list of recommendations for laws relating to the protection of fish and game in the state with a view to providing uniformity with neighboring states and at the same time to make the laws more effective is proposed. Among the more important of these are: A general open and closed season over the entire state and the repeal of the many special county laws. A closed season over the entire state for partridgo. grouse and prairie chicken. A change in the open season for wild birds to extend to December 31. A reduction in the limit of the trout catch from 45 to 25. Prohibition of the sale of black bass and muskellunge. Reduction of the bag limit on geese from ten to five. An increase of penalty for violation Workman Injured Fatally. Beloit.—Fret! Lust, workman with a construction crew, fell from n a car in the new yards of the Chi cago, Milwaukee & St. Paul company here and sustained injuries which will probably prove fatal. He had a leg cut qff and the other broken. Short W'eighing Charged. Stevens Point. —Felix Drifka, an Amherst Junction potato buyer, has been bound over to the circuit court charged with short weight. Aged Woman Found Dead. Portage.—Mrs. Eliza Phelps, sev enty-one years old. sister of Hon. F. .T. Kimball and postmistress at Biggsville for 12 years, was found dead on the floor of her home. Death was due to neuralgia of the heart. Files Expense Account. Madison. —H. H. Wirtheimer of Watertown, treasurer of the con gressional Democratic committee in the Second district, tiled a statement ii the office of the secretary of state, Sectoring that he-had spent $334,15. of the game laws is recommended —a line of S3OO for the use of dynamite, 

SIOO for having venison in possession, out of season, S2OO fa* shipping game to market and S3OO for serving venison in lumber camps or hotels. An amendment of the one-buck hunt ing law is asked to provide that the buck must have horns at least four inches long. Normals Seek $3,319,000. Recommendations for the appro priation of $3,319,000 for opera tion, capital and maintenance of the nine state normal schools will be made to the legislature by the state board of education, according to the budget approved by that body for the biennium, 1917 and 1918. Following are the items that make up the budget: Operation. 1917 '..51,003,000 Operation, 1918 1,043.000 Capital, 1917 737,000 Capital!. 1918 478,000 Maintenance, 1917 31.000 Maintenance, 1918 27.000 Total $3,319,000 The above makes no consideration of tiie revolving funds, such as the dormitories at Oshkosh. Stevens Point and Superior and the cafeteria, station ery stand and special music courses. Neither has any recommendation been made for provision for extension work by the normal schools. For this pur pose $4,000 a year is asked by each of the nine schools, hut the matter has been referred to B. B. Buckingham, statistician of the board, for further consideration. The extension work proposed is not academic, hut relates to the promotion of professional work among the teachers. , Included in the capital items above are provisions to meet requests for t lie purchase of lands. $131,850 for 1917 and $75,850 for 1918. These items, however, have been referred to the state engineer, who will make a sur vey of the needs of both the normal schools and the university with a view to determining the ultimate needs of the institutions in the way of added areas. Tiie university also will ask for funds to purchase lands. $60,000 for 1917 and $34,620 for 1918, principally to secure purchases of tracts upon which options now are held. All these land purchase proposals will be made the subject of a supple mentary report after the investiga tion. For the purpose of comparison it is shown by the records that the actual expenditures of the normal schools for the year 1916 were: Operation $ 733,000 Capital 382,000 Maintenance 25,000 Total $1,140,000 For the present year and the future, however, there is an additional school, that of Eau Claire, which was opened last September. ■—Hi,!

Weigle of I the dairy and food commission will j take an immediate appeal to the I United States Supreme court on the i injunction granted the Curtice Brother i company, Rochester, New York, by Judge A. L. Sanborn against the en -1 forcement of the state law prohibiting j benzoate food products to he shipped 1 into Wisconsin. ! In a recent decision in the federal district court, Judge Sanborn declared against the state law. Commissioner Weigle continued the enforcement of the law and the Curtice company i asked an injunction, which was granted In his decree. Judge Sanborn held that as shipments of the Curtice prod ucts Into the state were made in con formance with interstate commerce, the federal, rather than the state laws would apply. Under the state law the use of ben zoate of soda in food stuffs is adul teration and illegal. Rapid Progress in Soil Surveys. The present season has been a busy one for the men who are inventorying the soils of the different sections of Wisconsin. Besides the publication of detailed surveys of Jefferson and Columbia counties, and a preliminary survey of the north part of north central Wis consin. including Iron. Vilas, Price and Oneida counties', the Held work has been completed on detailed surveys in four other counties —Wood, Door. Portage and Milwaukee. At the present rate of progress it will be only a question of a few years before every county in the state wil have been carefully surveyed ana mapped according to its soil resources.

SUNMTSOKE Lesson (By E. O. SELLERS. Acting Director of the Sunday School Course in the Moody Bible Institute of Chicago.) (Copyright. 1916. Western Newspaper Union.) LESSON FOR DECEMBER 10 FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH. LESSON TEXT-Rev. 2:1-17. GOLDEN TEXT—Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.—Rev. 2:10. This passage most wonderfully illus trates that dominating purpose of Paul’s life. More than most lessons a map will be necessary to locate dis tinctly the places mentioned. There tire interesting stories in connection with each of the seven cities and churches. It might be wise to give to seven different people the task of bring ing information to the class regard ing each one mentioned. I. Ephesus, whose love is waning (vv. 1-7). The key word to these mes sages is the word “overcometh.” In each of the messages our Lord de scribes himself in a different way ac cording to the peculiar needs of that particular church. Here he is repre sented as holding the stars (messen gers of the churches, Ch. 1:20) in ids right hand, and keeping them secure, controlling them while he walks in the midst of the seven golden lamp stands, literally churches. The symbolism of “lamp stand” is used because (lie churches were intended to be light bearers as they held forth the light given by the oil of the Spirit (Math. 5:16; Phil. 2:16; Zech. 4:2-6). Ephesus was the capital of a province said to be one of the richest in the Roman em pire. In it was the great temple of Diana. Here Paul had labored and had various experiences, and to Ephesus he had written a letter (See lesson 8, third quarter), but there were good things to be found in Ibis Ephesian church (vv. 2,3). Forty years after be ing founded, John writes this message. He knew their “works,” their general moral conduct, especially its active and passive sides through its trials, its dealing with impostors and its prac tical energy and enterprise; and its pa tience (literally steadfast assurance) in bearing witness for Christ. Jesus knew of their never wearying endur ance. Surely these things would indi cate pretty nearly a model church. Jesus says, “No, there is something seriously wrong,” so seriously wrong that unless repented of he would re move them out of their place. 11. Smyrna, the church with a crown of life (vv. 8-11). Smyrna was 40 or 50 miles from Ephesus, and at this time a city of 250,000 inhabitants. To this church the Son of Man (Ch. 1:11) sends another message. It is interest ing to note that this church and the one at Philadelphia received from the Master unqualified praise. It had works, activities; it also had tribula tions, riches and poverty (for thou art rich) rich in good works, rich toward God, rich in treasures laid up in heaven; however, it was in the midst of persecution. - It was here that Poly carp labored, who afterward, as bishop of Smyrna, was martyred (see v. 10). Of Polycarp it is said tftat rather than save his life by renouncing Christ he cried out, “Eighty and six years have I served him, and he lias done me no ill; how then can I blaspheme my king who hath saved me.” The crown is eternal life, the crown of victory. The second death is the final condemna tion which sinners undergo at the judg ment seat of God. The first death is, on the other hand, the natural one. There was great hardship just ahead for tills church. These hardships pa tiently and loyally endured would bring the crown mentioned. There are doubtless great persecu tions just ahead for believers of the present day, hut we should not judge them but rather rejoice in them, since, patiently endured, they will to us a crown and a throne (Alatfi. 5:10- 12; II Tim. 2:12). Ii I. the church in a strong hold of faith (vv. 12-17). Our glorified Lord knew that the church in Pergumos was in a peculiarly difficult situation, that it was, Satan’s headquarters, ins “throne” (v. 18) ; hence they were in especial need of a defender and tiie Lord is represented as “he that hath a sharp, two-edged sword,” the word of God (Heb. 4:12-13; John 5:22), Per ga mos was almost fifty miles north of Smyrna, a city of about 1~,(X)0 inhabi tants. and the capital of the province. To it were brought many of the early Christians who were compelled to suf fer martyrdom. Again we have a church whose wprks are commended, whose stead fa is mentioned in that they “held fast to ray name, and not denied the faith”—martyrs (vv, 18). However, dangers threatened them for there had been a compromise with the world and with other sys tems of faith, what we would call to day liberality in doctrine and breadth in view in teaching: (1) Some of their number had accepted and practiced the? doctrine of Baalim (Jude 11; Nttra. 31-16). (2) These teachings cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel (v. 14). This was done by per suading the Israelites to join in the idolatrous feasts and revelings of the heathen, and also their impurity of worship. (3) Some of them had held to tiu- teaching of the Nicolaitans re ferred to under the admonition at Ephesus. These taught that the flesh had no part in the divine life, and might be regarded as something in different ; in other words ethical per fection was in the spirit; the body might indulge in whatever sins it saw fir. This kimj of teaching the Lord Jesus hates. The one way of salvation was for thorn to repent f*r the Lord would raise up faithful and time prophets who would wield his sword effectual ly against such monstrous forms of er ror, which were warring against the truth. , 

INTERESTING BITS OF NEWS FROM THE GREAT GERMAN EMPIRE. WHAT’S DOING IN OLD HOME Summary of the Most Important Hap penings in the Land of the Kaiser— Timely Items for the German Readers. “Stomach trouble is now unknown in Germany,” said George K. Eager, 11 years American consul at Karmen, tier many, who returned to America on a two months’ leave of absence. “Since the German has had to save food so carefully he no longer overeats. Most Germans have lost between to and 20 pounds, and the whole nation is in far better health than before (In* war. Germany lacks only fats and woolens.” Mr. Eager said that it was difficult !*► realize that a war was going on in Barmen, which is in the interior not far from Dusseldorf. The only evi dences of it are the many soldiers home on furlough and the women who have taken over the men’s work. “Ger mhny does not lack the necessities of life,” Saul Air. Eager. “There is plenty of food for another winter, especially since the recent harvest, which is a record-breaker. Large quantities of live stock are being fattened in prepa ration for a hard winter. In Ihissel dorf alone are more than 100,000 heif ers.” • * Interest in the announcement re ceived in Vienna that President Wil son intends taking concrete action in behalf of peace, continues unabated, though in many Austrian circles the view is held that the attitude of tin* allies will render Mr. Wilson’s efforts futile. While President Wilson’s good intentions are not in the least doubted and while his offei might gladly be ac cepted it is pointed out that the allies "would gain undue and unjustified en couragement if Austria-Hungary were to pit its own modest claim against those of the allies still seeking the dual monarchy’s dismemberment.
