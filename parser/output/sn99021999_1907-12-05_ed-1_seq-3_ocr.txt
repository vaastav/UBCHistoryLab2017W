The right of the Manley Elevator company, co-operative farmers' concern, to have sidetracks laid to Its property was tn dis pute today before the railroad commission. The company wanted, first free access from Its elevator to the stock yards of the company across property of a com peting elevator. Second, It wanted the railroad to run a sidetrack to Its property. J. H. Orr, speaking for the railroad, de nied the right of the company to proceed through the commission to get the track, claiming legal action In the state courts was necessary, through the Cone UW, which provides a way for enforcing the Harsh elevator law, enacted at an earlier Session. The chief contention, and one which strikes at the root of the right of the commission to aot against any rail road was that the railroad is engaged in Interstate business and as a 'corporation doing an Interstate business the Interstate Commerce commission alone could rule. The road threatened to appeal the case to this commission. Extracts from the re cent message of President Roosevelt were read to show this view of railroad regula tion to be correct. A suit In which Judgment for S500 dam ages was secured against the Missouri Pa cific In trial court Is now pending In tha supreme court In the case of the Manley company over the same track. County At torney Rawis appeared for the elevator company today. " ' After listening practically all day to Mr. Orr argue against the Jurisdiction of the commission to hear the complaint, the com mission late this evening overruled his ob jections and. the hearing will proceed. Governor Sheldon today appointed Mrs. Emma P. Johnson superintendent of the Home for the Friendless. Lincoln, the com mission dating from March 1 last She was first appointed March ,1, 1906.

"UNDER A TAX SUFFI CIENTLY HEAVY TO FORCE THE RETIREMENT- OF THE I88UE." "The president said enough about cur rency reform In Ills message," said Milton T. Barlow, president of the United States National bank, "but the tax must be heavy enough to make the issue an emer gency currency or It will be nothing but an Inflated currency, and we do not want that., The American Bankers' association plan provides for an 'emergency credit cur rency by permitting all national banks actually engaged for one' year and with a surplus of 20 per cent of Its capital to Issue additional notes, without security, equal to 40 per cent of their bond-seoured circulation, subject to a, tax of 2 per cent per annum on the average amount outstanding, and a further amount equal to 12H per cent of the capital, subject to a tax of 6 per cent. This plan I would not favor with the tax of fei per cent per annum on the currency Issued equal to the 40 pep cent ef the, bond-secured capital Of the national banks. The ZH per cent would make the currency simply 'nflated, and most of the banks would be using suoh a currency all the time. Most all of them would be willing to use the 'emergency currency at 2 per cent. The tax would be too low and would not retire the Issue, Favors Five Par Ceat. "It Is no my Idea this tsx should be I per cent at the time of Issue and that this would be the tax for the first six months. For the second six months I would com pel the banks to pay I per cent, and It they were not able to retire the currency at the end cf one year, raise the tax to 10 per cent. That tax would retire the Issue.. It retired the Issue of tha state banks during the war and the days following and put stata bank currency out of bustness. We must besure that ths Issue of emer gency currency will be retired. Blx months Is a sufficient time to tldfl the banks over most any financial flurry or panic, and after that time the rate should be pushed up." Vice President F. H. Davis of tha First National bank, aald: "The president said enough and his plan la 'O. K.' I would make the tax 10 per cent, perhaps, from the start, or after six months. If tbe banks were not in a posi tion to retire the Issue." Mr. Davis has favored such a currency since tha plan was outlined at Atlantio City. Presides MllUrd Caaaaeads Shaw. Former Senator J. H.

I would say that the rata of tax proposed by x- .' .'; --. - w is the Weber being made rapidly in these day&C thing as standing; still in piano mMufactorini'. Secretary Shaw and which I believe haa the endorsement of Comptroller Rldgley, would be satisfactory." President Luther Drake of (he Merchants' National bank said: "I favor the plan of the currency com mission of the American Bankers' associa tion, which provides for an Issue of credit notes equal to 40 per cent of a bank's na tional bank notes at any time outstanding and which are secured - by government bonds, but shall not exceed In amount 25 per cent of Its capital, and that every bank taking out such credit notes pay to the treasurer of tha ' United States in the months of January and July a tax of 1H per cent each half year upon the average amount of such notes In circulation. The tax Is to be paid In gold coin and w to ac cumulate In the United States treasury as a guaranty fund to redeem tbe notes of failed banks and to pay the cost of print ing and current redemption.
