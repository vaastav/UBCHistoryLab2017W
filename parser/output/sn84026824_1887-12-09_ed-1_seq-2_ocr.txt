<?|t ?[itp|trl>stoton Agistor. H. L. SNYDER, Publisher, 8HEPHERDSTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA. Friday, December 9, 1WM7. Ik the last issue of the Wat Virgin ?a Democrat the alitor, James M ason, com pares himself to a harlot. That is rough on the harlot, sure. -South Branch Intelli gencer. , # ? Thk estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury show that next year the sum of *326.530.793 will be require.! to run the government. Where would the go.y eminent be if it had as much trouble making collections as country editors have! # # ? Every now and then some ot the State newspaper* trot out a candidate for this position or that, and by ao doing think that they are thereby creating h boom for their m?n. We advise them to hold off a few mouths yet. lender little boomlets like tho*e we refer to Hre hardly able to live through a severe winter. # ? Several of the prominent northern railroads are doing away with car stove* and substituting steam for heating pur poses. These railroads have shown that steam- heating is possible for passenger trains, and timely action by Congress should bring the matter to the attention of all the railroad* and compel them to do likewise. ^ ^ ? Mr Carlisle of Kentucky has again been elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. No better selection could have been u.ade. lie has ability, integri'V, courage and all the other qualifications for the position. And the country may rest assured that he wil. ,|o all in his power for a fair revision of the tarift laws. ^ ? The coal bosses of Pennsylvania? that Is, the owners and operators of mine recently advance 1 the price of coal (rnm 11.00 lo $1.25 a ton beyond the usual >riie They said to the public, "Pay our prices or freeze." The poor miners asked an advance of 3^ cents a Ion for digging the coal. The bosses at once re ,u-ed It, and said. -Accept the wages we oBer or starve." The miners there upon went on a strike. Now. it i* re ported that the bo?*es are Importing 3 000 Belgian miners to take the place of the miners. The high tariff on coal en ables tl.em to do this infamous work. Who is protected here, the rich manor the poor man? Who always get* trie benefit of a high tariff? It i- designed fur the protection of the wealthy manu facturers, and the poor consumer is in variably the sufferer, ? * * The Senatorial situation, as interest ing to West Virginians, seems to be this: On Monday Mr. Faulkner would have been swort. In without objection from any source, had not Mr. Lucas entered a protest and made a claim for the seat. Acootding to precedent, the Republican former and future chairman of the Com udttee on Elections suggested that the matter be re fern* to the proper commit tev. To this the Democratic Senators n ?'reed. The Republicans have pledged themselves to settle the .natter as soon n* possible, probably within a week. Mr. Faulkner's friends say that if is understood perfectly that he is to be sworn in at the proper time, and he will very likely receive a unanimous vote. Mr. Faulkner himself feels assured that he will be given his seat. In the mean time he has been granted the privileges of the Senate, has had his name-plate placed upon a desk in the Senate cham ber, and daily occupies his seat, being busily engaged in the work that pertains to the position of Senator. # * One of the strangest things to Demo crats in this section is the course pur sued by Mr. Daniel B. Lucas. Mr. Lu cas is a gentleman who has sought, ob tained and accepted many favors at the hands of his party. Last winter he abused the usages of the party that elected him by refusing to go into cau cus and abide by the decision of the par ty. Now he is in Washington playing the same game in an enlarged way. A Democratic caucus of all the Senators in the city, believing that he had no ' claims to the seat, passed a resolution requesting hira to withdraw his preten- ' sions as a Senator, but with singularob- ; stinacy he arrays himself against his own party and refwM-tO yield a peg in ; his selfish, hopeless fight. In the face of all the rebuffs and discouiagements of the leading Democrats of the country, j on Monday he entered a protest against the admission of the Senator chosen by the people of the State, and succecded in temporarily depriving his former par ty of a much needed vote in the Senate of the United States. This dog-in-the manger performance is not much to the credit of Mr. Lucas. ? ? ? Thk President's message, which was sent to Congress on Tuesday, is an orig inal, impressive and courageous docu ment ? remarkable, aI?o, in that it treats of but one subject, the public finances. The President speaks of the dangers that confront the business interests of the country on account of the accumula tion of an immense surplus of money in the Treasury ; of the tremendous and oppressive taxation that is the means ef gathering so much more than can be scattered judiciously; and he suggests the several evil consequences of the state of affairs that now prevail?. But while he realizes these unpleasant facts, he also suggests the remedy unhesitat ingly. He plainly ascribes it to the absurd and unjust tariff laws. He is decidedly of the opinion that the tariff should be largely reduced, but at the pame time thinks that American labor should be carefully protected as far as consistent with fairness. He favors the reduction ot tariff on the necessities, but thinks it should be kept on the luxuries, and especially the hurtful luxuries. The message will probably not b" verj pleas nt reading to the manufacturers who have grown rich at the expense of the consumers, but it will be encouraging to the great m iss of American ciiiz'-ns. It shows that Urover Cleveland is a m ui of rare courage, ability and honesty. I.ntlrr from Washlafffoa. Washington, D. C., Dec. 5. 1887. Editor Btgxtier.^ Contrary 10 expect* tion there was no fight whatever over Mie swearing in of the new Senator* t<?-? ?lny. Judge Turpie, of Indiana, was sworn- In without objection. When ?f il'lge Faulkner's name was called Sena tor Hoar moved that hi* case be referred to the Committee on Elections, and assured the Senate that the case would be considered on its merits and reported back to the Senate as soon as possible. Senator Ken na said that wasa manifestly proper proceeding, and he hoped it would be taken without an V objection. This action was a genuine surprise to ail except the Senators, as it betokened some agreement between Democrats and Republicans to eettle the question ami cably and according to the letter of the law. Senator Kent?a said to-night In reference to the Faulkner case that the Committe; on Election* would be ?p. pointed immediately, and would make all haste ill the case that proper delib eration will permit. "And." he added, 'from my con vers.itions with Senators I predict that within a few days Mr. Faulkner will be awarded his seat by a unanimous vote." Washington Isjust now filled to over flowing with otHoe-seekers. Members of Congress themselves are in a cer aiu seine office-seekers, as they all want to be either chsirinan of a com mittee or a member of the best com mi t ! ees. So in the hotel lobbies at i.iglit are to be seen all grades after a bite at j Government pap ? from the small boy who wants to b<- a page up to the mem ber of Congress who wants to be on a big committee. Monday, Captain BaSfett, the venera ble doorkeeper of the Senate, celebrated the fifty-sixth anniversary of his set vice in that body. He was originally ap pointed through the Influence of Daniel Webster as n page in the Senate, being then only twelve year* of age, and has since been continuously about the cham ber performing the duties of the difler eut offices he has held. There is not a man living who has known more inti uiately the private life of the public men of this country, and during all these years he has kept a journal, which will be published after his death, and will be a most valuable and interesting ' contribution to history. There are twenty-seven red headed men iu the new House. The number ' is vouched for by an officer of the House who has kvpt a record. There are many with sandy hair and hair that is almost red, but they are not, counted in the list, only those whose heads are as red as blood being included in it. Many Congresses hive been noted for gray beads and black heads, but this is the tirstone that will go down iu history ns the red- headed Congress. So many red heads assembled together is supposed to be an augury of good luck. The Democratic caucus to nominate the diflcrent officers of the House Sat urday night was enlivened by a fight between Messrs. Blount ot Georgia and Breckinridge of Arkansas, in which the latter got a blow on the nose from the ' tin of his opponent which caused the ! blood to* flow. After the caucus the ! two honorable gentlemen met and apol ogized, and now everything is lovely : between them. ? Two important decisions were ren i dered by the Supreme Court of the ' United States to-day. The first was that of the Virginia officials who were sent to jtil by Judge Bond for refusing to obey an order ol his court. The Su i preme Court ordered the release of the . officials and declared that the State was ; a sovereign and could not be sued through her officials This gives Judge ; Bond a black eye, as lie has been bull dozing State officials and trying to run ; the State to suit his own ideas, but the 1 officials have been lighting him bitterly, ? and at last have gained a complete vie ; tory. The other case was on the con stitutionality of the Kansas prohibition law, which is sustained. The court held that in its police powers the State Iihs the power t? suppress the liquor tr .file. Senator Faulkner's desk in the Senate to-day was decorated with a chair made of blue, pink and purple immortelles, with a card attached extending the com pliments of Mrs. Charlotte B. Johnson, and adding, "Take a seat, Senator, we will give you three chairs." Conquerable amusement was caused while the House was being organized to-day by a man in the gallery lining (lie doxology and then singing it through in a stentorian tone of voice As soon as he commenced a hush as profound as death fell over the House* which continued until he had concluded, when a policeman tapped hi in on the shouldet and he quietly went out. The President, as his been predicted, has appointed Hon. L. Q. C. Lamar a judge of the Supreme Court of the Uni ted States, Postmaster-General Vilas Secretary of the Interior, and Hon. Don. M. Dickinson, of Michigan, Post master-General to succeed Mr. Vilas. This takes from the South one of itg j Cabinet officers and gives it a judge of the Supreme Court to succeed a South ; eru man, making a net loss ot one Cab I inet officer. S. W. J.
