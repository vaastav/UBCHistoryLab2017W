Wl laid th tha meaeage, it full, before oar raadera yesterday. Take A all in all, it is tha weakest and tnoat inconsequential Uoiminent that evei tnnatel from the ' chief mszietrnte of a Kreat nation. If we had not betore been fully convinced of Mr. Lincoln's utter Inability to successfully . manage the affairs of the Government, we could have no niingivings upon that tub joct after reading hie late message. We cannot help thinking how ssdly we have dcirenerated in the firmness of cliaiaeter and administrative ability of our rulers, comparing pant with the preeeut Adininis , tration. . The message it iliieflv, and almost ex . rrioeively devoted to tha negro question, The " poor African " seems always tip pe: piost, in AenAtiAM's mind. He argues atlcugth in favor oi hie various ernenci Jietion ecboiuea, but entirely fails to show that it ti either posmble, practicable or con etitutional. He taye ' without slavery tha rebellion! could never have existed;" endeavoring thereby to Convey the idea that slavery it the rant of the war. This we ttauy. t:1 tore the cause of the war iIku i tha hands of the assassin i Mi o.. . the murder; the knife is -u'v :,o : neut, and of itself would ' ; ttt.i ulcss.

Tea and dissensions among t'-rt : . (.-.. t. Lincoln might truly " ...ihout Abolitionism the re bellion could never have existed ; without Abolitionism it could not continue." If tha President will devote hiuiKelf to the work of abolishing Abolitiunium, he would soon end the war by removing the cause, ava millions of money, thousands of men, restore the Union, and hind it so thinly that it would nrvei again be rent in frag ments. ' Wa thiuk no more appropriate reply to tha President's arguments for emancipa tion can be adduced than his own language used in his letter to the Chicago preochets, who urged upon hira the necessity, and ' humanity " of a proclamation of eman cipation. In reply to their importunities, he said : "What good would a proclamation of email cipation irutn roe do, especially as we are huw eituaied? 1 do not wish to issue a document that ike whole world knowt must necessarily be inoperative, like the lue' bull against tbe eutneL Would my word Iree the slaves, ben 1 can not even eulorve tbe Constitution IB the rebel Slates? la there a single Court, or magistrate, or inilividset thai would be in fluenced by it there?

It exhibits an utter lack of both principle and patriotism. But no sensible mau ever dreamed of charging BaowNLOty with political principle or honesty. The liypocrisy of his pretended unionism is manifest in the fact that as soon as he could get out of Tennessee he came North ami retailed the silly story , of hie suffer ings at the regular " show price " ot twenty-five cents per head admission, snd pock eted a fortune in a few months by gulling the people. 1 If he it the patriot that he would have people believe, and . is for a vigorous, fierce, and bloody war, why did he nut shoulder a musket; go with the ar my beck to Tennessee, and fight for the deliverance and freedom of tha Union men he deserted and left to their fate ? This would have been more consistent with lus professions than making money out of his martyrdom.'-. - f ' 1 Yjjti-iw1 But we do sot desire, neither "will we hava any farther newspaper "controversy with Bbowslow.

We have already mentioned that the Bos ton newspapers have advanced their price from too to Ihrei cents a copy, and the New York Evening Pott has now increas ed it subscription front 99 to 810 per an um, with single copies at four cents. The subject is also under consideration by the Philadelphia publishers. .

I We kwrdly know wkat to believe ol the si sation of slfuirs on the Rappahaunock, but what have wa mast reason to believe does uot, ws confess, offer as a very plaasaat prospect. The rebels seem to be massing all their avail able force around Fredericksburg to resist our advance on Richmond from that direction, and it ia quite likely that they have aueceeded in perfecting fortifications and collecting a force saKicient to defeat any attempt of onr army to cross the Happahauaock at that point A river that has to be forded, and is yet frequent ly too deep to be forded, does not arroru any verv weal facilities for militarv movemenu even when undefended, aad when iu banks are uueu siw rvuuwuia, bwi kuus, kiiu uvt ..... ilk ,7 . 5 i. a . ered with well armed troops, it is decidedly ah unpleasant obstacle. Against sucn an unsta ble our army appears to have run its hesd, aad halted, either stunned or pnzsled. "A recoauoiesaace from which important results are expected" is promised, but these "iinpor- j tant reconnoiesances have too rarely led to any thing bat the disgust of the troops Con cerned 10 them, to give the puDiio any very lively hope of seeing anything else come uf this one. For the time the rebels have "head ed" as, -and owr Generals-soem to sea no way out of ths difficulty. The change of base to Frederioksburg, like McClellan's "change of base" to James river, was heralded before it was accomplished as a bit of "strategy" that would disconcert the rebel arrangements completely and take us on to Richmond speedily, itbas, so far aa ws can now see, ended just as the other did, in getting ns into a positioo where we can't ad vanoa viihoat danger, nor retreat without dis grace. If the rebels had complaisamly done nothing while we were "changing our base," and had let us cross ths Happabauuock and occupy Fredericksburg without Hindrance, we have little doubt that we should now be in a good deal better position to advance on Kiob mond than we were on tbe Potomac. Uut the rebela, most contumaciously and unexpected ly, it seems, would not lie still along the west ern base of ths Blue Kidge, and among its gaps, while we were getting between them and their capital. They started as soon as we, snd, though they had a longer road to travel, they heat us to the point. both were aiming at In plain English, ihey have outgeneraled us. We wish we could see some deep advantage under the apparent defeat our plan some rea son to hope that this blocking up of ths Rap pahannock and massing ot the rebel forces was expected and prepared for, that our get ting into that exceedingly close corner was only a feint to detain the rebels idle there while we assailed them somewhere else, but we ean't, Wa have seen no such profundity of planning in our Uenerals yet as would malts the failure of such a vast movement as the march to Fredericksburg one of the ar rangements for a final success. . Besidss, tbe rumors that the army is to go into winter quarters, which are begiuning to By tbiokly arouud tbe well informed circles of . Washing ton, show that no success oan be seen under this failure by those whose connection with tbe Government would give them at least the hope, if not the knowledge, that the failure is only a feint. This may be a discouraging : view of the case, but we can see no good iu concealing it Burnside has hardly bad a fair chalice yet, but he seems to have done very little with what he has had, except tode- j prive himselt of all prospect of doing any thing more. 11 it be true, as reported this morning, tbst Stonewall Jackson ia to remain in Northern Virginia, to employ our forces along tbe Potomac, aud revive every month or so those alarms for the safety of Washington, which bare done the country more harm than the destruction of Washington could do, we don t see but that we shall ba held all this winter in very much the same situatioa along the Potomac that we were last, winter. We don t feel happy in the prospect, we admit A Miscalculation. a In December, 1861, Mr, Toombs, in a con versation which is reported in the Atlantic Monthly, said that wars rarsly brought into the field more than a tenth of the adult male population, and estimating the whole number ot voterain the United states at tour millions, be ooncluded that, in the event of a struggls between the North and South, not more than fonr hundred thousand soldiers would be call ed out on both sidss. The loss of life, iu bat tle and campdisease, be estimated at one tenth of tha soldiers, Or torty thousand a mere bag atelle snd especially, as be said, that those Sen "must die enyAoie." II Mr. Toombs was to make figures to-day, ha would make very different ones. Four times four hundred thousand soldiers are in the field. At leaat twice forty thousand men perished in battle or by disease in the single four months' campaign on ths feninsula Nobody can set bounds to tbe range and waste of war. - It be eomos a raging fire, wholly beyond the con trol of those who kindle it, and not unfrequent Iv Involving them in its destructive ' A Grand Truth. oi The Cbicsgo TVwss utters a grand truth in tns tallowing quotation a truth as patent to all unprejudiced minds as ths light of the suu at noonday : "Abolition is the primary cause of our difficulties not slavery.
