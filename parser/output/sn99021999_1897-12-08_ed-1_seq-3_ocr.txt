In the meantime the board Is divided on the question ot the sulllclcncy of the notice , and an adjournment was taken so that an investigation , could be made. It Is desired to Hud out from the records of the postofllcc whether the registered letter was sent to the correct ad'dress ' and whether the admin istrator of the Reed estate know of the letter l > clng In the office and refused to receive it. The provision of the statute Is that it the dellnnent lives outsldo tlio state , or if his address Is unknown , service may bo Jiad by publication.

LINCOLN , Dec. 7 ( Special. ) The attor ney general has written the. following letter In answer to an Inquiry about fees and com pensation of officers : LINCOLN , Dec. 7. M. H. Fleming , County Attorney. Crete. Neb. ' , Dear Sir Your letter of rcctnt date was duly re ceived , In which you Inquire whether or not In the opinion of thin otr.eo the county judge or your county Is entitled to nny ooinixMiRntlon for ths services performed by him In appointing Judiics nnd clerks of olecllon. there being no statute providing for BUoh compensation. I nm of the opinion that he Is not. The right ot n publfc olllcer to compensate Is n cruitme of statute nnd docs not arise by reason of contract. Thote "who ncccpt public olllces which require them to rcn- dor services to the state must tnUe the olllco cum ontrn. The rendition of such service li grntutltous unless by express Htattitory provision , compt'iiBatlon fixed nnd nn express liability for Its payment Im posed on the state. " State against Brewer , ft ) Ala. , 131. A promise to pay nn ofllcer nn cxtrn fee or sum beyond thnt llxed by law Is not binding , though he renders services nnd ex- crclooH n degree of diligence greater tlmn could loyally have been requlr d of him. tlccnturc"nunlnst Vcrmllllon , 77 Illinois , 31G Thin case IB to the point , that the public nnfliorltlcs cannot mnlto even n binding contract to pay nn olllcer for services which the law docs not provide nny com pensation for ; that the officer must per form not only the duties attached to hit otllco hcn ncceptlng the fame , but nny additional dutl s which may be Imposed by lawful authority without additional com pensation unless the sumc Is provided for by ntatute. To the same effect la Sidney against Commissioners. 120 III. . 490. In Sampson against Rochester , CO N. II , 477 n person wns appointed ns a police olll cer nnd he accepted the appointment The Htntutf provided that police otllcers should receive such compensation ns might be \oted by the town. No compensation wa > < voted for this olllcer ; he sued for the value ot hl services. The court held Hint he could not recover. This Is In line with the Alabama case supra , which holds that the services of nn olllcfr nro prntultous unkhs thu compensation Is fixed by stntute. In other words , thnt ilglit cannot rest either In nn express or nn Implied contract ; It rests entirely on the stntute. In State against Silver , fl Neb. , So , lhe supreme court ot this stnte said "a public ofllcer must discharge all the duties pertaining to his olllce for the compensa tion allowed by law , nnd will not be al lowed compensation for cxtrn woik unless It Is authorized by statute. " To the Fame effect Is Uuyhn against Webster County , IS Neb , 131 In Ileald against Polk County , 46 Neb. , 28 , the court said : "When the law prescribes the duties of a public olllcer nnd fixes the compensation of such olllcer , ho must perform the duties required of him. by the law for such com pensation " It Is true thnt In nel'ber of these cases wns the exact question presented by your Inquiry before the court , but I take It , the principle decld'd by them Is Identical with 'hn pilnclplu that must control with respect o your Inquiry. It IH conceded tlmt there U no provision of thu statute authorizing the payment of any fees to the county judge for services rendered In appointing fudges and clciks of election. The right , therefore. If nny , of these otllcers to fees must urlsp. If at nil , from an Implied con tract on the part of the county to pay for the additional services required by the state. It is upon this theory , ns I under- utand it , that the Judges bass their clam. They say that because they were by the stuto requited to perform these services there Is an Implied contract to pay them the reasonable value of the Services. As We have seen , their theory Is not sound because , HO fur ns my Inquiries have gone , all the authorities nro , to the effect that the right of a public olllcer to compensation Is never the cienturo ot contract , but arises , It It arises at all , from the stntute.

With the children were- other relatives , among \\hom vine the aged s'fitcr of Mrs. McKlnley , Mrs. Abigail Osborne , mother of Consul W. M. Ofthonnc. The eceno was a pathetic one that beggars description. In the midst of It alt there was a joy unspeak able In the breaet of the president. He had again been permitted to see h'e mother alive. Ho had answered all the obligations of his country. Ho had fulfilled hie vows to his people. Ho had witnessed the assemblage ot congress and had been cheered with the nous at the same tlmo that h't > mother u < m better. la the little upper room at the McKlnlcy homestead this morning there was a sconu almost too sacred tor ucn to nrltp. The ejca of all prese.H were filled with tears as they witnessed the remarkable and almost miraculous rally of the president's mother from the unconscious state Into which she had fallen In the early morning. As her son entered the room accompanied by hla wlfo aad Miss Mabel McKlnley , the s'ster ' of the president , .Miss Helen said : "Mother , hero are William and Ida. " The president kneeled by her bedalde , kissed his mother tesderly , reverently , and as he diet so she put her arm about his neck and s'gnlfled that she knew him. She also recognized the president's \\lfe and reached her hsnd toward her. She recognized Mabel McKlnley and Jack Duncan. It seemed to friends that she hart been awaiting the arrival of her e : n. 

RCLAPSHS INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS. Soon after she lapsed Into an unconscious .state and the strength that had been hus banded for the bat meeting of mother and j ' son seemed to leave her. An hour after his arrival the president eat by the beJsldo holding the lund of his mother. The attend ing physician was ntirprlsed at the remark ably rally. At 930 ho said she \\ns growing weaker , but ho thinks she will live through the day. At 5 o'clock this morning It was thought by those In attendance' that the president would not arrive before the aged mother had , died. I'o was Informed that such was I thought to bo the condition. Ho was anx ious to get to her bedside. The run was a I rapid c o from I'ltte-burg , but there was a slight de'ay there In making the transfer to the Fort Waynetrack. . The presidential party was made up of President and Mrs. McKinley , Secretary and Mra. Day , Miss Ma. bel McKlnley , Mtes Mary Harbor and Jack | Duncan. The trip was made In the spec'al ; j coach , Newport , and \\sa without special In- I cldent. The party was met at the station ' by Abner McKlnley and Charles II. Mil ler , i Dr. Phillips , who was present at the tlmo of the president's arrival and the recognition , raid that he had never known such a rec ognition to occur in a case where the pa tient was as advanced In'years. It Is plain to the president , however , that despite the rallies f\\a \ has had , his , mother has been felling elnce ho left. "Mrs. McKluley Is resting quietly" was the word given out at the McKlnley residence at 11 o'clock. The president has remained near her ever since his arrival. Dr. Phillips loft Mrs. McKlnley at 1 p , m. She was at that time entirely uncon scious and resting quietly , . She has taken no nourishment for twenty-four hours. The doctor believes 'the ' patient Is stcadllv. though slowly , growing weaker , but can make no prediction as to ths hour ot final dissolution. The piesldeut has remained constzr/ly at the Indsldo since his arrival an 1 Kept to- nlght'a vigil , relieving others of the children who lhavo been BO constantly at the bed Me.

CLBVUbAND , O. , Dec. 7. Herbert W. SVolcott. president of the Cuban-Ajucrlcan , lenguo , gave a Btntcment for publication yes terday regarding the Cuban clause In the president's message. Ha wild : "I sco by a morning paper that the atti tude of McKlnlcy on the Cuban question Is gratifying to Spain , according to Scnor Dupuy Do Lome , the Spanish minister. Slnco reading President iMcKlnlcy's message this afternoon I cnn readily see that , and I think that his position Is much more gratify ing to the Spanish than It Is to the friends ot Cuba In this country. To tell the truth , I nm really disappointed. I had not ex pected very much on account of the late news from ( Washington , but the president shows by his message that ho will not do anything now , and probably nc\cr. Ar. < l this cannot , of course , but disappoint frlends of Cuba and those 'Who ' bollove thnt the president should Aland more nearly an the platform ot hla party , which declared that this government should use Us good olUces to brlctg about the peace and Independence ot thu IMnnd of Cuba. "According to President McKlnlcy the granting ot belligerent rights would be a good thing for Spain ami a Kid thing for Cuba , but , very singularly , the prominent Cubans In this country desire It. and thu Spanish minister , and these like Senator Halo who approve of the Spanish cause In the Island , are eoposed to granting It. "I hope that eongresa will bo more friendly to the Cubans than the ptcsldcnt , and that comethlng nuy > ct bo done for them within a short time. " T. Estrada Palma , representative of the Cuban provisional government In the United States , commenting upon President Mc- Klnley's message , according to the Herald , says : "I did not expect any recommendation to congress for Immediate action , but thu president has lett congress to decide- the tlmo within which an enduring peace must be established In Cuba and Intimates the necessity of haste by the use In this connec tion of thp words 'In. the near future. ' He further ta > s that In case of the failure of Spain < o pacify the island with the scheme of autonomy American Interests , humanity and civilization will demand forcible Interven tion. As Captain General Blanco himself admits that the Cubans In arms will not ac cept autonomy the tlmo the president speaks of has arrived. "It will be noticed that the- president docs not even suggcnt the acceptance of autonomj by the Cubans and It Is evident ho would not have written the last paragraph In the termfi ho did If he believed that autonomy would brlns peace to Cuba. " Mr. Ilenjauiln Dlgorga , formerly a mar ch.nt ot this city , but at present connected with the Cuban delegation and a brother o' Senor iil30 Illgoiga , said to a reporter : "The granting of autonomy to Cuba by Spain proclaims to the world the- Justice ot the Cuban rebellion and the right the Cubans had to appeal to arms , since only through force would Spain line been compelled to grant to Ctib.i what is but a mcic semblance o : homo rule. Ilut It Is now too late c\en fo- the most ample form of autonomy , which 1 * i.ot what Spain Is ready to concede. "Spain's autonomy will be such ! n name only and lor the cxclusUe use of the ipsl- dcits of the pott * and of the fe-v Intfflor towra held by the Spaniards. The Cuban patriots now In armc. who are the only on"s to dec'de. w'll nexer accept autoromj ; thoj have declared It time e.sd . aga'n ' ; they aie Hunting for absolute Independence 'ind th.1 offer of autonomy they corolder a plain I a\owal "by Spain that her oause Id lost. "At the beglnn.ng of the war , when Mar shal Martinez Campos suggfstcd reforms for Cuba , a prominent Madrid newspaper replied to him. vo'clng ' public opinion , that they would fccidto Cnto 'not reforms , but gunn ' Genetal Wejlcr went soon aftei to Cuba tc i carry out the policy then in vogue. Now when all Spaniards fep Spain's cause Irre vocably lost , as blichao no money and no I credit , no more men to send to Cuba and Is threatened with a Carlist war at home , be sides that waxed against her In the Philip pines , they a > c exceedingly anxious for the Cubans to accept autoiipmy. Why did the > lefuse ill before ? Iiee-tusp they considered themselves otrong and Invincible. Why do they offer it now ? Because they are con vinced of their defeat. This Is a signal vic tory for the Cuban arms , since through force Spain concpdcs at present what she formerly refused to grsnt willingly. Spain desires tc end the war In Cuba quickly , but she can only dp eo by acknowledging the independ ence o'f the Island Ne\er before wae Cuba so stiong as she Is now. Spain has never bsen so weak s nco the war began. It Is ri diculous to ask the Cubans to give up when victory , final and decisive Is about to crown their efforts. " nvij iiuMiiinn
