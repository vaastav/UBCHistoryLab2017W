Sells Was Affected and It Ke ') quired All Iler Strength te Re tain iler Calmness IVlien the Girl Finished the Mether "Wns SeMilntc Softly, lint She Sunrcd Florence the Ordeul of Cross-Exninlnntlen. Columbus, 0., Dec. 8. Florence .i. ., SfiWz, resumed the stand Friday morn ing. ' Se far she has told tlhe story of the intimacy of her mother with men ether than her 'husband since 1891. Florence has been fully cognizant of the intrigue of her mother with Hert Jehnsen, Ned lloymeur, Hnrry Lyens and Billy liett, but had kept the se cret, hoping that her mother would de better and the scandal never be come known. At last she was forced in vindication of her own geed name te tnke the stand and tell the whole shameful story. She was in geed vqiee and had recovered from her nervousness of Thursday evening. Florence told of presents of perfumes, diamond rings, wines and liquors which liett had given her mother. She knew of these because her mother had told her about receiving them. She had seen her mother fix the side deer se that Bett could enter with out ringing the bell. Bett sent Mrs. Sells green liquors In fancy bottles. Florence had seen her mother enter the Bunsen block and go up the stairs te Bett's rooms. Hteppptl nt 'Went Ilnilcn, I nil. Florence said that she and her mother stepped at the West Baden hotel. West Baden, Ind., In May, 1809. William Bett was there, and she fre quently saw him In her mother's room at night. Her father was net at West Baden. Bett was also with Mrs. Sells at the Thousand Islands " the same summer. Her mother and Bett had token long trips about the islands together, sometimes being away nil day. Florence said her father was very kind te her mother, and she had never seen 'him under the influence of liquor. According te the testimony of Florence, Bett had been warned ever the telephone by some unknown woman, who told him te put his property out of his hands as seen as pessibles as he was going te be in serious trouble. Florence told of the last day at home and of the last hours she Rpent with her mother. She told of hew en one oc casion that her mother had premised her she would never receive Bett again, and theh en the next night he was in her mother's room. Florence told of leaving home and going te her 'aunt's, where for the first time she told her father of her mother's ehamc. MrsT Sell Wit AfYecteil. As Florence told this story she was overcome by her emotion and vvt.r compelled te pause. Tears came into her eyes as she told of hew she had begged and pleaded with her mother te forbid Bett the house and hew that mother had broken the prom prem ise she had made. Even the judge en the bench was affected and the women in tl)e lobby had their hand kerchiefs te their eyes. Fer the first time Mrs. Sells was affected, and it seemed te require all her strength te retrHn her calmness. When the direct examination of Florence Sells was concluded there was expectation. Every one was ex pecting that no mercy would be shown the girl in the cress-examination, but Cel. Helmes, counsel for Mrs. Sells, arose and said: "Miss Sells, your mother has requested me net te cress-examine her daughter, and T will only nsk you six questions, te which you can return short an swers." Wns Sahhlnir Softly. Mrs. Sells had broken down and was sobbing softly, but her daughter was dry-eyed and answered the questions lnn firm tone. They were in regard te her love for her mother and grand mother and wliy she had net visited them. It was the most sensational scene ever seen in a court room In this city. When Florence was dis missed from the etand the plaintiff rested. Florence was conducted from the court room by her father, while the mother sat sobbing in her chair. The judge en the bench turned his eyes away and the counsel for both defense and plaintiff sat silent In their chairs. There had been dra matic incidents in the case before Fri day, but tlhis was the climax. Forget ting the fact that the daughter had turned from her in her trouble, for fer rrettiug her appearance en the 'stand and the testimony she had given, the mother bowed her head and waived the right of cress-examination, and let the story of Florence go te the judge. Mether Spared Her Child. Ne matter what 'Mrs. Sells was or is, no matter her sinB, her follies or misdeeds, she rose superior te them all and spared her child the ordeal, of a cress-examination. The plaintiff had but one mere witness te call, but he wua ill and could net come.se, with the understanding that he might be put en the stand'at pome future, time, the case et the plaintiff wan .then rested. ,. , . .
