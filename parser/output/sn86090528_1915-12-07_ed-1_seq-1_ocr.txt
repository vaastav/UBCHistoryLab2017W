STRIKING POINTS IN PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE The department of war contemplates an Increaie of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 officers and 102,985 enlisted men to 7,136 officers and 134,'07 enlisted men, and supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citizens. It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency. The gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. It is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and development that we should have a great merchant marine. It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that In what we are now to undertake we should pay as we go. We should be following an almost universal example of modern gov ernment If we were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from the income taxes. We have been put to the test In the case of Mexico and we have atood the test. .Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued remains to be seen. Our concern for the independence and prosperity of the states of Central and South America la not altered. Note The president's message will be found on page four of this paper. Ed.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. That the Democratic national convention, Juno 12, will be held in St. Louis, with Wilson the nominee, now seems th'e probable result of the meeting of the Democratic national committee. Sentiments were sharply but favor St. Louis. The fight now seems narrowed to St. Louis, Chicago and Dallas, in the order named. Balloting for the selec tion is expected to begin at i o'clock this afternoon. ' By United Press. WASHINGTON, Dee 7. The 1916 presidential campaign was launched here today with the Democratic na tional committee meeting to select a place and time for the Democratic na tional convention. The Republican committee meets here a week from today to do the same. The Democratic committeemen favor June. President Wilson's renomination was not questioned by the Democratic chieftains. Other features of the cam- paign, including renomination of Vice President Marshall, were much dis cussed, Informally. Democratic leaders, war horses and politicians, the usual entourage of the national committee's annual meeting and the committees from cities seek ing the convention, were here as usual. There was much verbal speculation regarding the alleged movement to . oust William F. McCoombs of New York as chairman. Friends of Fred B. Lynch of Minnesota were said to be active in trying to have him succeed McCoombs. Party leaders insisted the rumors were without foundation. Among the cities bidding fur the con vention were Chicago, St. Ixjuis, Dal las, San Francisco and Omaha. Lengthy arguments and pyrotechnics were scheduled. Called Jo order at 11 o'clock at the New Willard Hotel by Chairman Mo Coombs, the morning session was largely routine. There were eight vacancies on the committee. In two of these there were contests from Oregon and Kentucky. Urey Woodson and Gen. W. B. Halde man were the contestants for Ken tucky's seat and Will R. King and H. M. Easterly for Oregon's. Both contests presented novel tangles. Woodson was chosen by the Kentucky fctate committee. At last summer's state convention General Haldeman was named national committeeman. A similar family quarrel was the Oregon contest. King was selected by the Oregon state committee and in last year's primary election Easterly was chosen by the Democratic voters. Democratic precedent provides full four year terms for each committee men. The national committee was presented with the prob'""i of over throwing choices of state couiumtees, according to established precedent, by recognizing the choice of a party con ventions and the rank and file in a primary contest. Full authority and discretion was vestd in the commit tees, to decide the contests. Other new members seated today were: Vincent Miles ot Little Rock. Ark., to succeed W. H. Kavanaugh. former president of the Southern Base ball League, deceased; John T. Bar nett of Denver, Colo., succeeding Thomas J. McCue, deceased; W. W. Marsh of Waterloo, la., succeeding Martin J.
