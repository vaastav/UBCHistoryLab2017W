A Washington astronomer says the Pons comet will not bo visible to the nak ed eye much, if any, before New Year's Day.

It will remain visible from January until Spring. j There is great excitement in Montana over recent rich discoveries of gold in the Coeur d'AIene mountain.

The reason given Is, that Eastern mills have accepted orders for steel rails at $ 25 per ton, while tho least they can be made lor at.Ioliel is $:W. In England the present price is $28 a f IJO. As there is still a duty of $18 per ton on steel rails ol course the price in this country Is in no way affected by for. tign competition. It is Bimply because during tho high prices of the past few years the business of making steel rails was enormously overdone, and under our beautiful tarill" system there is no foreign marketoprn to our manufacturers in which t ) work oil' their surplus.

J he exciting content over the Speakership at Washington was settled last Saturday evening with much inure ease and expedition than a few b.'tirs before was believed to be possible. The strencth of Carlisle was found on the fu-t ballot to be ho overwhelming that his op poncnU were annihilated. Tne vote stood 104 for Carlisle. 52 for Randall and 3! for Cox. The voto explodes the nonsensical charge tbst Ihc triumph of Carlisle was "sectional" the north against the sou'.U for halt of Handall's vote and part of Cox's was from the south. Carlisle's heaviest TOte waa from the west, Illinois, Indiana.

The contest for tire clerkship was between Gen. J Clark, of Mo., aud Geu. Atkins, ot Tenn. The vote was a tie on two ballots and then decided in favor Clark by two majority. The other nominations, mailt' in each case on the llrst ballot, were James A. Winter smith, of Texas, lor doorkeeper; John I'.

CARLISLE FOR SPAKEK, The nomination of Carlisle for Speaker by the Democratic caucus at Washington on Saturday evening, by tho decisive vote on the first ballot of 101 against X.l tor all others, was not a personal triumph, lor per sonally either Itundall or Cox is more pop ular than the high strung Keutuckian, but it was the triumph of a principle. It means that the democratic sentiment of th s coun try, as voiced by its representatives in con gress, is sincere and honest in its demand for tariff and revenue reform. While it would not perhaps bo fair to say that Han- tl all is not also in accord with the general sentiment of his parly on the same subject, it is undeniable that the state he haiU Ircin and the centrolling influences of both par ties In that state, are such that the mission of the democratic party, to curb monopo lies and give the country an honest, consti tutional tariff, could not be consistently en rusted to his leadership. This was the more evident when it was 1 ound, from the very bcginningof this contest for thespeali ership, tnat not only the tarill" lobby, but the renrescntativcs or every manner oi suu sidy and all sorts of steals, were in Wash ington in lull furec working for the elec Hon ol Randal!. Rife defeat, as the Chicago Trihiur very justly points out in an arti cle too long to copy, upsets the plans of the dozen of corporations in this country who own about $100,000,000 a;rcs of pub lie lands on which they reluse to pay taxes ; the plans ot the whisky men, who want an indefinite extension of the time to pay their taxes; tho plans of tho California millionaires, who want to grab 15,000,000 acres more of the public domain: of the American Tin Plata Association, who want to double the cost of tin cans, i in cups and cofTco pots to line their own pocket, and so on, and so on. At the same time, however, that the elec tion of Carli6lo fills the whole monopoly and grab mongenng horde with dismay, it is not a committal of the democratic party to the doctrine of Free Trade, in the sense in which republicans always use that term. Mr. Carlisle, in his speech on taking the chair, defined his position unmistakably on that head in tho following pregnant tonus: Sudden and radical c'langes in the laws and regulations affecting the commercial and industrial interests of the people shell J never bo made, uules-s imperatively de manded by tome great public emergency, and, in my opinion, under existing cir cuni.jtiinces such action would not be fav orably received by any considerable hum ijer ()t lhoHl) imvc given any attention to the subject. 7'Wt; irho fear that tiny rutnyt'M that ihuu m uwlertaken mil be m- 1'irtoun t ait' iut' rent or em u aiiord mis- 'liable ran? for elanwr (till be 'really (Us- So the Republicans, bo far as the election ol Mr. Carlisle is ceucerned, may hang up their bugaboo of Free Trade in tho Mu seum of Antiquities by the side of the Bloody Shirt. While the country is under an nnavoldablo necessity ot raising a reve nue of some 200,000,01.10 by tarill' imposi tion, tho democratic parly is not insane enough to commit itsell to the ignis fituan of absolute free trade. But in tho adjust ment of these absolutely unavoidable taritf exactions the democrats can aud will be guided dy the, simple proposition tha': there aro other interests than those of the Penn sylvania iron and New England cotton lords to be looked alter, and that one class of citizens nhall not be favored to the ex clusion of all other classe.v In their opin ion tut) producing classes and tne consum ing classes have as largo a claim upon the recognition of ttie government as the mnn- utact'iring classes, and subsidies and boun ties, m often miscalled protection, do not, as n matter of fact, in the long rim benefit the manufacturer no more than tin y do the consumer. "In the existing tariff," as a very able cotcmporiiry puts if, "there are boundless inequality and false pretence. They may not, indeed, be able to reform its anuses, but they can expose them and lay down n line of reform which they pledge themselves to carry out If intrusted with power. To this reform they will at ence I'ddrc-a tbemselvcs carefully, patient- ly, and thoughtfully. In this work of ex position they will show the country that they are tho friends of the people at the same time that they are agents of honest and enlightened government." THE JUA.INE PROJECT. Tho project of Mr. Blame, in divide the whisky tax among tho states according to population, is variously commented upon bv the press, though upon the whole greeted with more opposition than favor. Tho New York Sua thinks .Mr. Blame can hardly be In oarucst, and that his object is merely l remind his fellow citizens of his continued existence, which they were In danger of forgetting. Aside from that, the project us coming from the state of Maiue, is chiefly notable for its chcekiness, con sidering that the state in question baa for 32 years past utterly forbidden and made a crime tho traffic from which the revenue in question is derived. Tho Chicago Tribune thinks the six mil lions a year the plan would give to Illinois would be a good thing to use io making ,te icncepi0 4 the Illinois ship canal. our state taxes otherwise being so light that their continuance at the samo time would bo no burden. Tho Tribune indorsement ol the Blaine project, however, is very guarded and upon the whole, rather Pick wickian in its tone. Tho papers, however, that take a serious view of the matter, are all agreed that the one fatal objection to tho project Is that It is unconstitutional. Congress has power to "levy and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises" only for national objects "to pay the debts and proviJe for the com mon defense and general wellare" uot of ttie states, but "of the I'nihi States." Judge Story says that "this pover to levy taxes for Ibo common defense aad general welfare of the United States is no; a general power. It is muled to those objects. The federal government cannot transcend them. If the defense proposed by a tat e not the common defense of the United States, 51 the wellare be not general, but tpecial or local, as contradistinguished ;rom national, it is not irithiit the trope of theUonstitn ti'jrt. If the tax be not proposd for the common defense or the general welfare, but lor other objects wholly extrincous, it would be indctensitile upon consti tutional principles." So Mr. Blaines proposition, a-well as John Logan's quixotic tcnenio tt convert the whisky tax into a grand elucntion fund, falls dead at the feet ol the constitu tion. IHE MES8AGE. As usual, wo give place to ths full text of the President's annual message on the re assembling of Congress. The document always contains such a comprehensive survey of the condition of tbecouury, both in its foreign aud domestic reluliois, as to alloid interesting reading to mostpeople, while It does away largely with thcnccessi ty of reading the voluminous repots of the departments, of which it is a sorto rename. The message read to congress in Tues day, as a conventional documeit ot the kind referred to, is a model in its way. It is not unreasonably long, it overs the whole ground, it gives all tho luormution tho people expect to find in it, aid careful ly avoids all expressions und bplcs caleu. l'ded to give offense to any part; or faction. The President no doubt wil' be heartilj endorsed by the down east fsl.crmen fori the stand he takes in favor if protecting their rights; there will bo 10 dissent to his views in regard to pauer immigra tion; nor to his suggestion liateomeihiug should be done to prevent the wholesale evasion which is now systematically prac ticed of tho laws against Ciincsu immigra tion. In his agreement with Secretary Folger that tho present ejecssive taxaticn and redundant revenue arc to be deprecat ed, yet that it "would not be wise at this session of congress to adopt measures for a largo diminution of the revenue," ho is evi dently mir.oi'ul that a presidential election is impending and assumes the role of the wily politician rather th:;n of the honest and courageous statesman. Another deba table agreement ot the President with his finance Secretary is that in favor of allow ing tho Natioual Banks to Issue currency within ten per cent, of the market valuo of their bonds on deposit with the povcni mcnt instead ot tne lace value, ni now. Such regulation would be the organisation of a perpetual picnic for the bulla and beara. Line Ihe Postmaster Gonerat the President is unable to bring himself ip to the point of recommending the estabish- ment of a postal telegraph system, thaigh he has nothing to say against it. On the Mormon question, however, he has 'cry positive, ideas. Ho would treat the uccr heroically, by abolishing the tecto rial government entirely and goverfing Utah by a board of commissioners, nsthc District of Columbia is governed, accrd-, ing 10 laws and regulations lirnl Jowl by congress. The message h notable for some cubpi- cuous omissions, among which are naaed tho uecessity lor a bankrupt law, for rliof to the Supreme Court, for authorizing be al taxation of railroad lunds, for sumiiary rejection of preposterous land claims aud for immediate correction ot the nmsej practised by railroads built with mblit monevs and directly subject to congjesno nal regulation. liut what Illinois has peculiar reasons to complain of is that the President has who), ly ignored the earnest appeal made to hlia by Gov. Hamilton for a simple reference, if but ty a line, to the actioii of thi s.ta'.e of jfering to transfer the Illinois caaal to the general government on certain conditioi.s. It woul.l have been but a simply act of courtesy due fo the Governor of a great state and its peoplo and wonld have cost Arthur iiothini?. 

CONGRESS. There was a full attendance in both houses i, f congress when the gavii rapped to order at 12 o'c'ork on Monday, but the proceedings iu both were very short. The senate did no more than administer the oaiu to nine newly elected members and tl.tn adjourned to await the organization of the bouse. In ihc latter body consider able lime was spent iu calling the roll and witling the members In their seala, after w hich the ballot for speaker was taken, re sulting in 191 voles for Carlisle, 113 for K'eifcr, 1 for Robinson, 1 for Wise of Vs., I lor Wadswortu of N. Y., and 1 for Lacy ot Michigan. The scattering votes were mostly republicans who couldn't stomach Keifer. Mr. Carlisle was escorted to the chair by Randall, Cox and Keifer, and the oath ad ministered to him by Kelly, or Pa., the oldest member or the house. Mr. Carlisle then made the customary speech or a new speaker on taking the chair, after which the house adjourned. ' On Tuesday, in the senate, besides read- ing the president's message, about a dozen of bills were Introduced, including one by Edmonds for the establishment of a postal telegraph system, and one by Heck to aiitbo rizetho purchase of foreign built ships by citizens ot the United States. Tho house completed its organization by electing the nominees of tho democratic caucus for clerk, doorkeeper, &,c. The members spent boiuo time in the usual drawing for Beats, after which the Presi dent's Message was received and read, and the usual motion adopted to refer it to the committee of the whole and order it to be printed. Wednesday the session of the senate was again merely formal, the repub Means, who are supposed to be in a ma jority in that body, being in a peck ol troubles over tho election of the officers Several caucuses have been neld without coming to an agreement, Mahone nnd Reddleberger of Va., refusing to attend the caucus, though promising to yote lor its nominees if Gorham, a creature of Ma hone's, is nominated for sergeant at-arms. whom Edmonds and others violently op pose. Among the bills introduced was one by our senator Cullom to re organize the legislature of Utah, und one by Logan to give each soldier and sailor of ths late war a quarter section of public land. In tho liou90 the death of Thomas II Herndcn, a member elect from Alabama, was announced, and the customary reso lutions were passed, upon which an ad journment was taken to next Monday.
