It Is n horilble of. ferce at lest, and the Philadelphia exploits In this lice were accompanied by so many ag- uriientliu: circumstances as to be dreadful beyond Imagluillon. Xcw York sets nu example In at least one respect lhat other States would do well to follow, and lhat Is sharply following up lrreg. ular practitioners of medicine. Several per sons who had not complied with lbs laws of the State about plivsicinns were arraign cd last week. One of them was charged witli nracllelni under a false name. He c.v plained Hut ho could not afford to pay for n new sl.ru, and therefore used the old one. Another offender hnd no diploma, and was tried for a second offense of the sort. bogus diploma was among Ihe assets of n third healer. The haim these fellows ib is si i ply appalling, and they ought to lie dealt with in the severest tossible wnj. Jnyt'oul.l h is been endeavoring to have Ihe charter of ihe Mutual Union telegraph compa- nv acated,and now Ihe attention Is returned, nimliciith'ii bin hit been made tolhe Altorncy- lleiurd of New Voik.Satuulay.to vacate the ch hut of ll e Western Union or,to quote the words i f th'! application, to "vacate Ihi char ter and annul the existent- of laid compiny n'ld lo icuiove the dirtctors from office, and cunpel them to account for their ofllclal con duet lu Hie iiiniiagenient of the funds and propctH committed to Iheir charge, and to piy to Hie corporation, or its creditor.", Ihe money and Ihe value of the prorerty which they have lranferred to others.lost and wast e 1 by violation of Iheir duties." The ground of the application Is Hi' stock-watning of the Welti rn Union. '1 lie di!Ciisin about tobacco has been l.ig Ingwith mole or less violence ever since King James's day, and still Ihe question is an open one. The 1 it est contribution to the ronlioersy is by tli.it well-kuowii pioTes sinniil journal lb" London famctl, which sajs lhat ' pioperly and moderately enjojed, tohaco smoking is not a baneful habit." The caul'ions added by the Lttnal that those unfavoiably allcctcd and the young should lelniin, and tli.it no dgam should he smoked for nmi e th.iu thiee-qunilers of their length, ought lo be accepted by all icasouable pinole cri, although some m ly doubt that cigars are preferable to pipes. Two of the greatest cviU in connection wilh Ibis habit inhaling the- smoke into the lungs and the use of to bin co by the youug are pointed out by the l.nnnt wilier with timely words of warning. The Niprenie Court of Pennsylvania has jiM rendered a very Important decision in rclstlon to the taxation of foreign corpora thus. The authorities of the Slate under took to lax the SUndanl Oil Company for the toll amount of Its properly, because the Company, although a corpoialion chartered by the State of Ohio, did business in the State of Penusjlvniii.i. The question before the Court was whether Ihe entire properly of this corporation was taxable in I'cnnsyl luuii, or only so much of It as was found within the State and lo Ibis extent subject to Its Jurisdiction. The authorities of Penn aylvania ciatii.ed the right to tax the entire property of the Company, whether it was In the State or not. The Supreme Couit rejects this view, and limits the light of a Slate lo tux n foreign corporation doing business therein to Ihe propel ty that Is actually wlth lu the limits of the Stale. General Sheridan's explorations in Wyom ing, Id dio and Montana last Fall of which he has iccently sent a report lo the Adjutant Genera', surgested to his wind a new Indian policy. The Ciow Nation numbers 3,470 souls, and Its reservation, on which n few cattle graze anil a Tew berries grow, contains U.OUO.OCO acres of valuable land. "I would recommend," wiitcsGeneral Sheridan, ''that Ihe government gie eighty acres to the head of each family, buy the balance from the In. eiians, paying them, say, half a dollar per acre, If thought proper, then purchase gov. eminent bonds with Hie money, and each year use for their support, through the com missioner of Indian affairs and their agent, the inteiest upon the bonds, without touch ing the principal. This Interest would be xcry much more than is now appropriated fiatly, and the Indians, by these means would have n perpetual fund, tho principal nf which should never be touched except by ni ls of Congress. Iu fact, if all Indians and their men rations, sure treated In this way, a belters stem of government lor the Indians could bo oblaini'd. It would also be a good baigain for the government, as llic purchased land could bo sold toiictual Ecltlers for an ad vance, and be occupied by people paying taxes, to say nothing of the opening upof tho country." Theic is sense in the general's idea, but the trouble is lhat the fionlier white man would have to be entirely recon structed in order lo make Ihe plan work. If the actor IVayno hal killed his victim In New Yoik he could not have escaped so easily as he did in Cincinnati. In New York it is a misdemeanor for any person even lo point a firearm at another person. Lack of malice or of intention to discharge the weajion is no palliation of the offence under lltcbiw, and the person convicted of the inbdemcnuor may he fined not more than H0O, or Imprisoned for a year or less, or both lined and Imprisoned ntthe discretion of the court. The statute gives a person wounded or maimed a civil ictnedy In u suit for ihmajci rgiln-.t Ifccaulhorof his Injuries, and If hi should he killed, It continues that right or icmcdy to his heirs or personal rep. resentatlves. Hcclion 4-J7of the new penal code applies this principle even more strict to Ihe inanageis of Ihcalrcs or circuses, who by it arc made vicariously responsible for tho use of wiupons on Ihe stage or In the ring. It says that if the lessee or occupant of ouy place of umubcmcnt or plot of ground or building uses it or allows ii to boused for the exhibition of skill lu throwing any sharp Instiiinient ut u human being, or permits a tiro-arm of any desei I pi Ion or even a how to be aimed or discharged at a human being, he commits u misdemeanor, anil may he punish ed by a fine not exceeding S300, or Imprison ment for not more than a year or by both. Such should be the liw In all States, or even more severe, and It should be mercilessly enforced. Affairs In Utah are not progressing veiy satisfactorily, The Utah (.'oininlsslou.ln Iheir (list icport, say lhat they have no radical measures for (lie suppici'lon of polygamy lo recommend.

Picclsely what legal forms shall bo obs.rved In older lo icnke the mar rings! obllgition undir the I iwa of the United States, is net determined upon. It is n lilt il cas5 to scllle, and Is liable lo Involve Injus tice .llh justice. Seeielsry Teller makes some gold points In his K-cciit litter In Mr. Pilce.Coininl'slon cr of Indian Affairs. He recommends that the old heathenish dances, such us the siu dance, scalp dance and war dance, be discern tinned, ns they are Insurmountable obstacles iu the way of the civilization of the Indians. At these feasts Ihe warrior recounts ids deeels of daring, beasts of Ms Inhumanity in llic destruction of his enemies, and his treatment of the female captive?. In language thntoiight to shock even n savage ear. The nudience assents approvingly to his hoist of falsehood, dec. It, theft, murder, rape, and tic! young listener Is informed Hint this Is the only road to fame aud renown. The Secretary also calls attention to His marriage rilatiou ns re quiring the immediate attention of the agents. When the Indian depended on the chase be was tardy able to suppoit more than one wife, bat since the Government has support ed hlmUjc more wives he Lns the inoie r.i- lions he gets.

He icconuneiids a mole thorough system cil caring for the properly of the Indian", Hat the custom prevailing of destroy ing the propeity upon the deatli of Ihe held of the family miy be rooted out. These suggestions appeir to be excellent ones, nnd though there arc tlilllcul- lles iu the way of canylug them iut, the same thing could be -slid of nny plan fot the amelioration of the Indian lot. nit: novum mi; tn mi: tii.H.itU'ii. The iu guinents advanced by I't'-tinjsler- Geiieral Howe, in his repoil, in favor of n consolidation of the telegraph nud postal sciiiccof thl-. counliy arc pounful, ucil but for tlie-fact that the in.inagcrsof Ihelelegiaph do not sxish lo give up lb' power and iiolit of the gleal monopoly, and lint Ihcy have meanstocxeil a very Miong counteracting inlluciice on public opinion, lliey would he universally convincing. Seme of Ihcm aio as follows i In almost all countries save this, tcheri.iph service Is conducted by the postal nuthorl tlcs. The business of the telegraph is inher ently the same us that of the mad. It is to transmit messages Horn one ncison to niiotti. the power to establish is uot limited to any particular moiics el transmission, llic telegraph was lot known when the constilu. lion was ndiiptcd. Neither was tiie railway. The power to employ one is ns clear as to employ the other, if the union of Hie two sei vices did nut Improve that of the telegraph at all It would impiove the postal service in some important icspceK It wouhl neeissi tale the employment of telegraph operators for postmasters In many office-?. T his would lesult In giving lo tho administration of not u few otlices men who have learr.cd lo do one thing In place of those who have ncvir learned lo elo an thing. If the two olllcis weie united, whenever a mail did not airive on time, the public thronging the psti-illce woiiiii learn, not meieiy mat Hie train li.ul not uirived,but when it would arrive. Again, Ihe necessity for delivering messages would facilitate and draw after il Ihe free delivery of mails in places wheie free drlivciiy Itself is Impracticable. lul a union of llic two services would. I believe, Improve the telegraph more than It would me postal service. Admitting the foruu r service to be honest and ellicieut, the fact remains that it is not cheap, and under corporate control it can not be cheap. Kent for both services would cost but little more than the cost for one. Soofluei nnd of light, Wliere there Is now u free deliveiy of mail, telegraph messages could he deliver ed ut less cost by the postolllcc than by n corporation, lie-sides, if the business was controlled by the Government there would be but a single management of the whole. The business is now charged wilh tho cost of many different inaiiagcuncnts. One dliec. lion is cheaper than several' Again, cor poialions will seek, and ought to have, not only remuneration for the cost of minimis, (ration, hut interest on llic capital Invested. When competition hecomesinjurious tolhe companies the competition Is extinguished. The only protection the public can have against these mullplicd exactions is for Hie Government to nsiunic that exclusive con trol over llic transmission of domesl o mes sages by electricity which It now has over the slower methods by tiiui and stage coach, These, we say, aresliong reasons stiong enough to counterbalance all possible objec tions. Indeed the main objections urged against consolidation of the two systems, ale largely illusory. One is lhat such consolida tion would greatly Increase the number of federal officials. It would not incicase Ihe number ns much as Is supposed, by many. Hut there Is no icason why the Govci nmcnt should not employ what cHlleeis It actually needs. In the smaller olllecs the postmaster aud operator would be one. To add mi operator or two lo thcfoicuof postofliee clerks, In the larger offices, would not practically endanger Hie libeitles of (he psople. Another objection is that telegraph ic messages would lose llielr confidential char acter, when passing threme-li I ho hands of poslofllcc officials. There is nothing of this. The average postmaster or postodlcc clerk, Is iiomoic leaky than the average telegraph opeiator, They could, and we believe would, be held to moro strict coutiol utuler the Government than they now nici under the telegraph superintendents. The gient public would be tho gainer ns regards secre cy nnd immensely the gainer us rcgaids ex pense, under consolidation ; and the sooner it Is e-IIectcd the hellcrfor the country. Con. gress has already provided u mode of ndust. I ng let ins for the purihusu of all telegraph liiUH by llic Government. Let Ihe Govern ment oircr the telegraph companies fuirpilees for their lines, with tho alte rnative that If the offer is declined Ihe Government will build lines for itself, and thtie need be no fear that tho puichase will not bo effected. Tho Government could then icducc the prices of clegiophic despatches at least one-liitir unci yet derive a leveuue fiom tho telegraphic service, On Tuesday Mine.

Just now there Is a good deal of excited discussion In the papeis, ns lo whether llic healih of school children Is not cndangeied by confinement nnd overwork. Not long since, the New York fiiWpnl lislied along list of le-tteis from pupils and pure-ills of pupils, who thought that the (hlldicn's henllh was being mined by loo much nppll cation and confinement. The question Is nn Impoilnnl one of course; but we can not l.ok for any definite nnd sensible concluslou of the trailer, until the lht bent of piejiidiccd discussion is over. it Is ii Hill known flic 1 that when any subject that Interests a lug' numlicrof people divcrsrly Is pulto Ihe test i f pro and con, Ihe fannllci on both sides get into Ihe field of discussion first, brandishing nil manner of otlthllidlsii weapon", and null- lug such nn outrageous hubbub, that sensi ble i-oplr are ural-le lo ge-t their swords of wolds together nt all. Wo have lieatd, on the subject (d overwork In schools, a good deal e f llabel crying from the contending multitude, nnd shsll wnit some-time longer before the true knights of the subject get to gether and decide Ihe dav. Very Utile has been said, ns yet, by the teachers and prominent educators throughout the country. Thev are ceitaluly entitled to n respectful hearing, having made the sub Ject nf popular education, lis best methods and means, the study of their lives, The physicians have sdd little. ie n uy cer- lalnly look to them for the final voice in Hie matter. So far the discusdan bus hern al most cnlliely between parents anil pupils on one hand nnd nJventltloiis scribblers nnd literary old maids cn the other the two classes least qualified to advance any thing of weight on the subict. It is possible, however, as the advance diseucsion becomes less warm and rapid, to anticipate a few of the points upon which the final decision nf llic subject tests. The first, of course, will be that of the number of hours daily spent In sedentaiy school tasks. In mcst of the small towns and cities throughout llic counliy, the number of school hours per day Is limited lo live, or at the most, six. Six bonis, say, oi.t of Ihe tv cnty-fuur i iine-fotirlh of Hits who lime, one-half of Hie winking time. 'I h it I equivalent to saving Hint Ihe life of the school child Is equally divided between wori- nnd play, wilh a considerable suiplus on Hie si le of piny, arising from llic three nnniiil vacations. Consider now lhat the physical cjnstitutlo'i of the average child, in its unde veloped stole, Is not equal Ion cindiilon of cunMnnt bodily activity. It l lnio-sb!e for a child to cxuiisc steadily mote Ih.i'i llnce or four houis ut n lime without ex peiicneing profound fatigue. The sleep of a holiday night 13 often fervcrisb and icsllcs", and the ihild wakes in Ihe moiniiig utile- freshed In body and dull In mind. One half of the hours of Ihe day, judiciously distrib utee!, give ample time for exeielsc undplny. The physical rest of the school hours, of it self, inn not be detrimental. This senti mental talk aboul llic unhealthy effect of "tedentaij" school lite is all nonsense. If it were not fur that same cnfoiicd lest the child would be fai more apt tu exhaust his vital powers before kc came to j cars of dis ciclion. School life, in these daj, is p'cas. ly xnricd, too, by frequent change ol position and surroundings. The classes alternate between one recitation room and another. Lessons aic leciteil In a stand ing position. The study hours nic brief, and tasks made shorter and moic eclectic than they used to he. There Is at least one lecess iu each session. Ample nooning allowed, and the absurd custom nf punishing pupils by keeping Ihemaltei the regular school hours is going out ot vouc. Less commendable, It seems to u, Is llic solid-ses sion mctlio 1 of the city schools. qvo hours' rest belw cen sessions lias a wonderful i lfect In resting and freshening Hie mind s and it would be icasonablu to suppose that much of the value of the second session In city schools is lost by too brief a nooning. Sane additional force may attach to this objection from the fact that it is from the pupils of city schools that the complaint of overwoik principally comes. The second point about which Hie contro versy will wnsc Is that ot competitive ex- nndnntion0. Here, It seems to ih, Ihe ad vantage in argument will lie with the ob jectors. So wise mid sensible a man us Prof, Max Midler deprecates Ihe present system of competitive examinations, in an earnest nr. Ilcle in the Vontemjiorary Iltcietr, He says that the system of packing tl.c mind Willi facts simply for use at examination is aJ hurtful one, and leads to no useful re sults. If the modern scholar is overworked at all, it is only dunug the process of "cramming" for the frcrpient exami nations which vex the course of an otherwise pleasant and interesting sub ject. Some educators claim that this meth od is the only way of testing a scholar's actual acquaintance with a subject. It is a good melhod of listing his absorptive pow. cis, but il is worth absolutely less than noth ing in the cultivation of the luomory. An infrequent examination, not competitive. general and not particular in its character, ut the cloe of each subject, is doubtlcis bene ficial ; but the ficepicnt and exhaustive tests now employed In school work are objection. aide. Mental vigor the power ot doing a go d deal of Intellectual work with out exhaustion depends hugely upon the sanitary uud hygienic Conditions uudei which the student works. This will be the thiid principal point upon which Hie question ot overwork iu siliools will rest. Ventilation, comfoi table seals, piopcr leinperatiuc, ileanlincss, piovision against chaik-dtist, all these are pirlieulais in the piobjcm. In n sihool with proper sinitary aiiniigeincnts there Is seldom sick ness, nnd there is far less likely lo be com plaint about overwetk. A sound mind iu a Sound body is not likely to be ovcibiiide-ned witli u reusouablc ntnuunt of school woik. When educators and physicians nnd those who have a leal knowledge of the subject take hold of it ut the above points, and say what they honestly think, Hie question of overwoik In schools will be In the way to solution. California Republicans made a better show ing at the last election than at first was sup posed. They lost the Governor and all the Congressmen, nnd, remembering that Pago was the leading candidate on the Congres slonnl ticket, the lust showed discrimination among tho voters ; but Ihe Republicans, be low Governor, elected on Ihe Slate ticket Ihu Ijlcutenant-Iiovciuor, the Siiprcinu Judge, Hie clerk of the Suniemo Court, thcciimii- troller, Ihe secretary of Slate, the trcusurer, tho oltoi ney-general, the survey or-gcneral, Ihe superintendent of public instruction, uud the State printer ten out of the twelve. The Democrats keepthe State senate through hold-over Senators, hut of tho eight Senators chosen the Republicans elected six i they chose twenty. six against fourteen in tho House, and have a majority of eight nn joint ballot. Such results us these by no means show that California is a Democratic State.

This is kiown ns the curfew section or Hie repiession act, which reads i "In a proclaimed district, if a person Is o it of tils place of nbode ut any time after one hour later thai sunset and before sunnuo under suspicious circumstunce-, any consta ble nny arrest that person and bring him foithwith before a Justice of the peace, and such justice, after Inquiry in'o the clrcums lance of lb cisc, may either discharg-j him or lake the necessiry steps, by committing him to prison or taking bail, to bring him before n couit of summary Jurisdiction acting under tld net, and if such person on appearing befi re such com t fails to satisfy tiie court that he was out of his place of abvde upon some lawful tceaslou or biislness,hc shall he guilty of mi offence against this act." The enforcement of this law pliiniy shows the condition of lie-land's principal city Government ollicl il- are living iu a state of telloiism.
