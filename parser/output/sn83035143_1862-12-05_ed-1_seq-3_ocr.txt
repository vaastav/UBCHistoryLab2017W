The Philadel phia Ledger says : Petroleum oil, which rose so rapidly from twenty-fire eents a gallon to a dollar and ten, hat taken the back track "again, and is down, as reported to sixty eents. The rise was merely speculative and somebody will make or lose fortunes by the sudden fluctuation." Fabulons amounts hare been realised by oil speculators and it now remains to be seen whether or not they have been lost by re-investment. Michigan Tboops Expictid. Captain Daniel's battery, connected with Col. Cope laud's Mounted Rifles, will arrive here this morning at ten o'clock A. M. The 1st de tachment of Copeland's regiment, (the 1st Michigan Mounted Rifles, )will arrive during the day, on the steamer Morning Star. The Xd detachment will come by rail from De troit, reaching here to-day some time. The ii detachment will be sent on as soon as transportation can be obtained. Col. Gray's 2d regiment of Michigan Mounted Rifles will follow soon. They all go to Washington by the C. A P. B. R. A PcrzLiira Cask. It makes some dif- ; ferenee, in a person's feeling, we inspect, on which side of the prison door he stands when he looks through the iron lattice work. The sensation produced by looking out, day after day, may be novel and interesting, bnt most people prefer to stand on the outside and look in. In oar rounds yesterday we visited the watch-honse. We found a lad about fifteen years of age, with his face pressed against the iron bars, looking out. ( If he had " look ed ont " for himself a little better he never would have got there.) We asked him what he was there for. " Stealing boots," was the reply. He said the man he worked for told him to grease np the boots, and while he stayed, wear them. He did so wore them off and was arrested and locked up. As we walked away we mused curiously over the case, in which there is more than appears at first sight. He had permission to wear the boots while he stayed with his employer. Very well. Suppose he hadn't left his employer's sight for a year and had kept the boots on constantly meantime, wouldn't the boots have been worn away t and wouldn't the boy have been liable to arrest? Be was arrested for taking the boots off. Ha had probably taken the boots off fifty times before and no notice taken of it ; why notice it in this particular case ? Then again it could easily be shown that the boy didn't carry away the boots; the boots carried him away. Why not arrest the boots ? His late employer claims that when the boy abandoned bis service the boots were to have been left. Well, they left, didn't they? Another idea; perhaps the boots were " rights and lefts." Admit ting that, the boy took no more than his right and left. Don't you see T Then how an the man claim the. boots as bis own, when there is abundant eridenee to prove that they had been soled. Thi Ghost Discovxked ! Last evening s party of resolute fellow, armed with clubi, bowie-knives and revolvers, started ont on a search for the ghost. They petroled the streets in the vicinity of the cemetery for several hoars. About midnight one of the party who had got a little ahead of his fel lows, ran back, hatless and pale with fright, exclaiming, " I have seen him I I have seen the Ghost I" His comrades were seised with a sudden trembling and showed a disposition to ran. One-suddenly remem bered an engagement that he had downtown and started on a ran to fulfill it. Another said that he had been np late for several nights and he "thought he'd go home," and away he scampered also. The remainder held a consultation and concluded to investi gate at all hasards. They cocked their re volvers, loosened their knives, and grasping their elubs more firmly, crept stealthily, with chattering teeth, to the spot indicated. They peered through cracks in the fence inclosing the yard, and the horrible spectre was reveal to them, swinging its weird arms in the moonlight, and nodding its bead in a most diabolical manner.. All immediately took to their heels except one bold fellow who determined to ascertain whether his Ghost ship was flesh and blood or not. He sprang over the fence, club in hand. The spectre did not retreat but continued to swing its arms And nod its head mockingly. Choking down bis fear the man raised his club resolutely and aimed a crushing blow fairly at the spectre's head. Down went the ghost and down went the ghost hunter, for his club met with but littleresistanee. Horror stricken he regained his feet, when lo I he found that the Ghost was a woman's night gown which had been left ont on a clothes line. A night-cap pin ned on the line at the top of the garment was what appeared to the excited imagination of the ghost nun tars to be the spectre s (lead. Koneef that party desire to have the papers say anything about It and they probably wont. ARRIVALS. The Shooting Affair at Camp Cleveland-- ARRIVALS. The Shooting Affair at Camp Cleveland--The Soldier who Fired the Shot, in Jail--- ARRIVALS. The Shooting Affair at Camp Cleveland--The Soldier who Fired the Shot, in Jail---Great Excitement in Camp---The Soldiers want to Lynch him. We made brief mention in last evening1 edition of the shooting of Orderly Sergeant John G. Fay, of Smithnight's Battery, by a soldier. The soldier is Malcolm Thompson, of Captain Merrill's Company, 125th regi meet. - Thompson left camp on Wednesday evening, and came to the city. He remained here until nearly noon, yesterday, (getting quite intoxicated meanwhile) when he return ed to camp. Aeoording to the report in casop, he went to the quarters ef the 20th Battery, where he had no business, and was noisy and quarrelsome. He went to Captain Smithnight's quarters, and was ordered away. He refused to go away, and said he could whip any man in the Battery. Orderly Ser geant Fay, of the 20th Battery, took hold of him and thrust him into the guard-house. As Sergeant Fay was in the act of fastening the door, Thompson fired his revolver, the ball passing through the door and entering Fay's breast in about the eenter just above the stomaeh. Fay hardly knew that he was hit for nearly a minute, when he plaeed his hand on his breast, and said " I am shot ! A surgeon was 'summoned, who advised that he be taken to his friends, as it was proba ble that he was fatally hit. He was imme diately eonveyed to the residence of his sister, on Huron street. At five o'elock in the afternoon he was alive, but his recovery was considered hopeless. Doctors Meyer and Schenck and other sur geons are attending him. The ball has not been found. Seme anppo that it is in his lungs ; others that it has passed through his lungs and is lodged in his back. He raises blood constantly. Sergeant Fay is a single man, about Zl years of age. He had formerly practiced law in this city. He served three years in the service in Germany. Great excitement was created in camp when the occurrence became known, espe cially among Captain Smithnight's men. There was a disposition to execute summary vengeance on Thompson, by hanging or shooting him, amd it became necessary to post a strong guard around the guard-house in which he was confined. Sheriff Craw was sent for to remove the man to the County Jail, for fear of his being lynched by the mad dened soldiers. Sheriff Craw and Deputy Sheriff Fraiee went to camp and brought to jail about four o'clock r. M. The soldiers did not interfere, although they ex- ibited a strong inclination to do so. Tho decision and coolness of Capt. Smithnight and his officers, and the firmness of the Sher iff and his Deputy had mnoh to do with pre venting any serious outbreak. Our reporter saw the prisoner, Malcolm Thompson, in jail, last evening, and con versed with him. His history, which he re lated to oar reporter, is interesting. He is twenty-three years of age, and was born in Campbeltown, Argytshire, Highlands of Soot- land, sixty miles from Glasgow, where both is parents still reside. His father, Alexan der Thompson, was for many years a sea cap tain, but is now a road contractor. At nine years of age Malcolm came to New Orleans, on board his father's vessel, together with is mother. Maleolm and his mother went to Little Rock, Ark., and remained for some time. She afterwards retained to Scotland, but Malcolm has always called Little Rock is home, although he has been away from there a good deal. At twelve years of age he went to sea, and has been a sailor eight years of his life. He was at little Rock when the rebellion commenced and enlisted on the 25th of Feb ruary, 1861, in a battery belonging to the 2d Arkansas brigade. He was chosen Orderly Sergeant of the battery. He served for twenty-two months in the rebel army, during which time he was in five important battles, vii: Springfield, (where General Lyon was lied,) Belmont, Fort Donelson, Pittsburg Landing and Perry ville. In the retreat from the field of the latter engagement he gave himself up to Brigadier General Smith, in command of a division of Kentucky troops. He was takon to Louisville, where, after taking the oath of allegiance, he was released. He went to Cincinnati and there enlisted in the 125th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Ho came here about two months ago. With regard to the shooting of Fay, he says he had no intention of shootiog him or anybody else. He acknowledges firing through the door, but says he didn't wish to hit any one. If he had desired to shoot Fay, he says he eould easily have done it before being shut np in the guard-house. He ssys he wa very much in liquor. Thompson is a stout bnilt fellow with dark hair and a most resolute and fearless eye. He looks as If he might be dangerous when interfered with in any way. He expresses sorrow that the Sergeant is shot, and hopes rill recover. He don't appear to be much troubled by the occurrence, and speaks of It as a piece of " carelessness " on his part. He will probably be tried by military law, whether the Sergeant lives o- :es. We learn that a soldier u was in the guard-house at the time Thompson fired the shot, says that after the latter knew that he had shot some one, he (Thompson) began to re-load his revolver. We know not how true it is. Thx Lictuse. There was a good house at Brainard's Hall last evening te listen to Mr. Taeistro's lecture en the " Giants and Pigmies of America." The lecture was a polished and oft-times eloquent effort,deliver- ed without notes, and was interesting, al though mueh of it, pertaining to such men as Clay, Webster, Jackson, Calhoun, Benton and others, whom he placed in the category of " Giants," was necessarily far from new. He interspersed his notices of these men with characteristic anecdotes of them, which gave spice to the lecture. There was a degree ef ostentation in the way in which the speaker managed to introduce himself into all the historic scenes and among all the " Giants" whom he so graphically and eloquently de scribed. It was pardonable, perhaps, for if one has mingled with the great men of the past it is hardly to be expected he will con ceal the fact. The " Pigmies " of America were not mentioned by name, and indeed very little reference wis made to them. The speaker rather left it to be inferred tbat the "Giants" have all departed this life, and that none but " Pigmies " occupy their places. Fob thx 23d. Captain Hunter, of the 23d, (whose arrival in the city we noticed some weeks since, when he brought an ounce of secession home with him in the shape of a ball in his leg,) leaves for his regiment to morrow morning. Any letters left at Hower A Higbee'a to-day will be taken by him. He will be at Elyria Saturday and Sunday. Cap tain Hunter is an old Crimean soldier. LOCAL NOTICES. Pocirr DiABtxs vox 1863.

Mr. Ashler said that during the lata canrasa in Ohio, a number of private and confidential letters, written by him to the surveyor Ueneral or Uoloraao aerntory, touching- the latter's application and ap pointment to office, had been published, in connection with newspaper comments charging him with swindling and defraud ing the Government. He wanted an in vestigation of his conduct. He therefore offered a resolution for the appointment of a select committee of five to investigate and inquire into the whole subject. It -being objected by several members that no specific charges had been made, Mr. Ashley withdrew his resolution, with a view of modifying it so as lo meet the objections as to its phraseology. A resolution was then adopted instruct ing the Committee on Military Affairs to inquire and report as to the better care of sick and wounded soldiers. Mr. Hutchins offered a resolution in structing the Committee on Military Af fairs to inquire and report as to the pro priety of dispensing with the West Point Military Academy, and instead thereof aiding the endowment of military schools in the several States. The resolution was rejected by 49 to 13. Mr. Aldrich introduced a bill to reduce the rates of Congressional Mileage. Re ferred to Committee on Mileage.
