Bryan says that there will "be a general disappointment in the war like tone, where the President dis cusses the army and navy. To Mr. Roosevelt's statement that the navy is the surest guarantor of peace that this country possesses, the Nebraskan says: "Shame upon a chief executive that he should nine" an -f force against the nation's sense of jus tice as a guarantor 01 |j ace. guarantor of peace is our nation's prin ciple to deal justly with other na tions." Not yet. Mr. Bryan may have read about the time when swords shall be beaten into plowshares and spears into prunning hooks, but he will never see it himself. Dealing justly with other nations is no guarantor that they will deal justly with us, especial ly if we are without army and navy. Mr. Bryan's words are high sounding and are doubtless indicative of what the world should be, but Mr. Roosevelt is dealing with the situation as it is today. His messag" is to a congress that is sitting and that is expected to act. It is not a sermon on turning the other cheek if smitten on the one. He may believe in that scriptural ad vice personally, but it is not his person nor his personal property with which he is dealing, but that of a nation, which believes in defending its own, whether it be citizens or property. In all controversies .there may 1e one right and one wrong. If we are right, the other nation must be wrong. If we are just the other must be un just. But the fact that we may be right and just is no guarantee that there will be no pretended grievance against us in order that some of our island possessions* may be secured. The best guarantor of peace in that case is just what President Roosevelt says' it is, a navy. Upon the subject of war the President says: It must ever be kept in mind that 'war is not merely justifiable, but im perative, upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where peace can only be obtained by the sacrifice of our conscientious conviction or of na tional welfare. Peace is normally a great good, and normally it coincides with righteousness but it is right eousjiess and not peace which should bind the conscience of a nation as it should bind the conscience of an in dividual and neither a nation nor an individual can surrender conscience to another's keeping. Neither can a na tion, which is an entity, and which does not die as individuals die, re frain from taking thought for the in terests of the generations fliat are to come, no less than for the interests of the generation of today and no public men have a right, whether from shortsightedness, from selfish in difference, or from sentimentality, to sacrifice national interests which are vital in character." It may be seen that the President takes note of the fact that he is talk ing to public men and not to private individuals. He gives thought not merely to the people of today, but to the generations to come. Mr. Bryan is not practical. His ideas are not for application today, neither are? they in the interest of'the next generation if they are applied now. 

DISCHARGE OF TROOPS. Since the revelations of Secretary Taft in his report of the rioting of the negro troops at Brownsville, Texas, there will be few who will question the justice involved in the dismissal of the men from the government service, although the question of the power of the President in taking the action he did may be one for dispute, especial ly if some of t.ie senators desire to look upon it as such. The people of Brownsville objected when they learned that the colored troops were to be sent there and the secretary of war sent a letter of ex planation to Senator Culbertson. He said that on account of race prejudice there was usually some one to object when the colored troops were sent to a particular locality, but such objec tions usually came before the removal instead of after the troops had occu pied the fort for a time. The soldiers went there and it was but a short time until the trouble arose. There may be a question as to who was the aggressor, but there seems to be satisfactory evidence that on one occasion the soldiers left the fort and "shot up" the town. Houses where innocent women and children were residing were shot into, several people were injured and one or more died. That this took place, there is no denial. The matter was then up to the ad ministration to determine who the guilty parties were, that they might be punished. No information could be secured on the question. Every soldier who should have known it if any rifles were missing from the racks, who should have known it if any men were slow in answering when the battalion was called upon the alarm from the sentinels, and who should have known it if any soldiers participated in any such lawlessness as took ulace in Brownsville, Texas would tell noth ing. After plenty of opportunity was giv en, and after the men had had a hear- lng before the President, through their representatives, the men who refused to give any information on the subject were dismissed along with those ac tually guilty of the shooting. The President may have exceeded his authority, but, it seems, that is yet to be determined." Some of the sena tors have interested themselves in the matter and propose to have a full showing of the evidence, perhaps with the intention of making the executive squirm. However, in this instance it is quite certain that Roosevelt will have supporters in the senators from the south, as well as in some from the north. The question raised is as to whether the men could be legally dis charged without first having been tried by the court martial, and if so, whether or not the order could be made so far teaching as to disqualify the soldiers from any government position, as it was made by President Roosevelt. That the soldiers, white or black, got what they deserved, there is no ques tion. Whether the President had a right under the law, to act as he did, will be determined by the investiga tion that seems certain to follow. Major Lacey wasted no time in tak ing up Ottumwa's federal court bill. It is needless to say that he will do what he can to accomplish the change in this session. If it is not done while he is there the chances are slim. 

QUESTION OF EX-PRESIDENTS. New York Mail.—The story of Air. Roosevelt's desire ttf enter the United States senate at the close of his career in the White House is still in circula tion. Meanwhile John Bigelow re news and presents in pamphlet form his argument for a constitutional amendment under which retiring presi dents shall become senators without further action. "Our Ex-Presidents," reads Mr. Bigelow's title "What Shall We Do. for Them? What Shall They Do for Us?" Tho idea of giving senatorial places to former chief magistrates of the re public is very old. Under discussion, it has presented always as a splitting point of opinion the question as to the voting nov,er of the new class of sen ators. Mr. Bigelow meets the point squarely. "Each senator shnll have one vote." This is a proposition to overthrow the principle of state equal ity in the senate., without the accept ance of which the constitution itself would have failed of adoption. Objec tions to this change are not met by Mr. Bigelow's argument based upon differences in state populations. It was because there were big states and smaller ones that the rule of two senators each was fixed. Representa tion on a popular basis was left to the -other house of congress. Until the last spark of jealousy be tween states shall be extinguished there will be little hope for Mr. Bige low's scheme entire. General consent might be obtained to a proposition that former presidents should sit as honor ary members and advisers of the sen ate. But this position of limited use fulness would scarcely satisfy the as pirations of a man like-Mr, Roosevelt, leaving the presidency as he will do at 51, stiil full of strenuous impulses and ideas. Had it been arranged at the begin ning of the republic that retiring presi dents should become senators, there would have been in the chamber dur ing the period of 1861-62 five members of this class—Van Buren, Tyler, Fill more, Pierce and Buchanan. In 1825 26 Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Mon roe would have been sitting in 1857-61, Van Buren, Tyler, Fillmo-« and PierOo. Since 186S the numoor of senators of the ex-presidential class would never have risen above two. It is possible that the very fewness of survivors of presidential terms in any recent time has militated against national action that wquld keep them in public life. 

ROOSEVELT AND THE JAPS. Kansas City Journal.—Special inter est attaches to that part of the-Presi dent's message that deals with the Japanese situation. Although Presi dent Roosevelt's policy is not set forth, his attitude toward the trouble in San Francisco is definite. He points out that the duty of the government in its relations with other governments is analogous to the duty of the individual to his neightbor. He asks congress to pursue a line of action that will es pouse the exalted cause of honesty and courtesy in international affairs and to believe that ue same honesty, unselfishness and courtesy should be looked for in the motives of friendly nations. At the same time the Presi dent is unwilling that our material in terests may be sacrificed in the pur suit of unreasonable conciliation. It is only a matter of common jus tice that the Japanese residents of this country should be given the same treatment as we accord to immigrants from Germany, Italy, England or other European countries. The children of men and women from these countries are not discriminated against in the public schools. It is also an effective point-in the President's statement that Japanese students are admitted to a'l our first-class colleges and other insti tutions of learning. Thus justice and consistency rally to the side of the Japanese in their controversy. One point in this discussion that has not been sufficiently emphasized is that the grievances of many of the people of San Francisco are not found ed upon any particular aversion to the Japanese race as such. Few people 'n the country at large understand that many of the students who demand ad mission to the San Francisco schools are grown men who came here without a knowledge of the English language and who find the public schools the best place to acquire the rudiments of an xJnglish education. This means that adult men, foreigners who have no inherent respect tor our people and who have been brought up under a different standard of morals, have been in the habit of attending the low grade schools where they have not at all times conducted themselves pro perly toward the children of tender age. The suggestion readily occurs that it would be easy for the state of Cali fornia to pass a school law limiting the age at which students may enter certain grades. That would solve UuU THE 

OTTUMWA COURIER phase of the problem. Such a law exists in other stated, much for the same reason as complained of in San Francisco. But the fact that this sim ple arrangement does not suit the people of California argues some other motive in stirring up this trouble. The labor problem in California takes large stock of the Japanese, and they are denounced and feared as competl tore. because they are unusually good workmen and are a clean, energetic race. That '.s the milk in the cocoanut. Considering this, there should be no hesitancy in supporting the President in the sentiments he has expressed on this subject in his message. 

ALLISON'S SUCCESSION. Marshalltown Times-Republican. The suggestion of Congressman Lacey that he could defeat Governor Cum mins in a primary senatorial succes sion offers a sportsmanlike method of settling a controversy which many of Mr. Lacey's friends insist has caused all the present factionalism in Iowa politics. It is a physical certainty that a successor to Senator Allison will have to be elected or pinpointed before very iong. The aged statesman is past 77 years old and very sick. Even if life 's spared him for several years, as ev rv man in the United States sin cerely hopes, he will never he able to ensure the physical strain of anoth er session at Washington. In the inter, ests of his own health and welfare ho should never try it'. The fate of Sen ator Gear, who was propped ijp at the last solely for factional purposes, and probably shortened his life thereby, sliould serve as a warning. It is no discourtesy to Senator Alli son for the people to begin to discuss his succession. The people of Ala bama, who have primary elections for the nomination of their senators have re-elected two aged statesmen, and have already elected the two men whom they wish their legislators to name for the succession of each, thus officially recognizing that the ravages of time are inevitable. The announce ments to friends in Washington by Secretary Shaw and Congressman La cey that they expect to be considered for Allison's place, would indicate that these two very close friends see no discourtesy to the venerable gentleman in discussing the matter at this time. The primary election method is the only lair and just way of settling a dis pute of this kind. Let the coming leg islature give us a statewide primary law. The recent republican platform declared unequivocally for such a law, which would giye an opportunity for the voters to express their preference in electing United States senators. The democratic party has claimed that it favored popular election of senators. Let a statewide primary election bill be a non-partisan measure, and let's end this factionalism if it all arises from the senatorial ambitions of a few men. Th-3 men in the Times-Republi can office are ready to vote today as between Blythe and Lacey and Shaw and Cummins. The primary is the thing. 

"MADE IN IOWA." Burlington Hawk-Eye.—Ottumwa is to have a new pottery works, which will employ between 200 and 300 hands. No doubt, the enterprise will prove a success and no doubt, as Iowa's fame has now spread to the uttermost confines of the earth, there will be a brisk demand for these goods. They ought to be stamped or labeled, "Made in Iowa." That would be a good ad vertisement for the state and the city and a guarantee to the buyer that he was getting an article of real merit. PEOPLE'S PULPIT. 4* *3* FELLOWS AVENUE SIDEWALK Dear Editor.— I see by the Cburier that the council rescinded the action taken at the last meeting in regard to sidewalk on Fel lows avenue. Now I would like to know in what manner a citizen is go ing to get recognition from this coun cil. Here we have a gap of about 360 feet from the end of the walk at the intersection of Center avenue and Fel lows avenue to the intersection of Bismark and Iowa avenues, that is ab solutely without a walk of any descrip tion. There are quite a number of men and boys that have to travel these streets to get to their work and back, and several young ladles who must wade through this nasty yellow clay mud, and why? Now I have told the members of the council, the mayor, and practically every city-offlcial that could have any thing to do with it, that I am willing to build my part of this walk, which would be 115 feet, and it would be a very small job for the city to make the grade, as the dirt would not have to be moved to exceed 75 feet any place. I got up a petition for this work and presented it to the coun cil early in the summer, with the sig natures of 83 interested parties. Are we going to have to wade this mud another winter and spring or will the council recognize the rights of the la boring men and women and at least put this much of the walk in this win ter and not keep putting it off ag, they have been doing without any good cause, as there is not one of them that will say that this work is not an abso lute necessity.
