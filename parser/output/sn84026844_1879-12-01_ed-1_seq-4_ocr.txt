PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. [Continued from Fir$t Pag*.] War Department estimate* for the figcal year ending June 30, 1881, ore $40,880,428 93, the eauio being for a loss nam of money than any annual estimate rendered to Congress from that Department duriug a period of at loast twelve years. He concura with the General of the Army in recommending such legislation as will anthorizu tho enlistment of the full number of twentv-five thousand men for the lino of tho Armv, exclusive of the three thousand four hundred and sixty* three men required for detachment duty, and therefore uot avuilablo for service in the Held. Ho also recommends that Congress be asVod to provide by law for tho disposition of a large number of abandoned military posts and reservations, which, though very valuablo in themselves, have been rendered useless for military purposes by the advance of civilization auUaeUleuient. IIo unites with the Quartermaster General in recommending that an appropriation be made for tho construction of a cheap and perfectly tlie-proof building for the safe blorage of a vast amount of money accounts, voucher*, claims, and other valuable records now in tho Quartermaster lioneral'aoflU'e, and exposed to great rl*k oi local uesiruouon uy lire. lie alsorecommendsin conformity with tho views of tho J Ailvocatc General, some declaratory legislation in reference (o the military flUtute of limitations as applied to I ho crime of desertion. In these several recommendations i concur. 

TIIK WAR DSI'AliTHKXT. The Secretary of War further reports, t hat the work for the improvement of the South 1'uss of tho Mississippi liver, under contract with Mr. Jameali. JCada, made in pursimnce of hii act of OongreM, lias been prosecuted during tile past year, with a greater measure of success in tho attainment of results than during any previous vear. Tho channel through the South I'ukh. which, at the beginning of opera* tloiiH in Juno, 1875, had u depth of only seven and one-half feet of water, had. on the 8tl? of July, 187l?, a. minimum depth of twenty-six feet, having a width of not leas than two hundred feet and a central depth of thirty feet. Payments have been made in accordance witfi the statute, as tho work progressed, amounting iu the aggregate to $4,260,000; and further paymenta will become due, as provided ^ by the statute, in the event of success in maintaining the channel now secured. The reports of tho General of the army and of his subordinates, present a full and detailed account .of the military operations for tho suppression of hostilities among the Iudianfcof the IJte and Apache tribes, and praise is justly awarded to tho oflicers and troops engaged, for promptU08S, hkilland courage displayed. Tho past year has been ono of almost unbroken peace and (juiet on tho Mexica& frontier, and there is reason to believe that the etl'orts of this Government and of Mexico, to maintain order iu that region, tt'tll nraifn tiorinnnunf 1 ? ctiodncafnl This Department was enabled during tho pnst year lo find temporary though crowded accommodations, and a safe depository for a portion of its records, in the commote east wine of the building, designed for the Rate, War and Navy .Departments. The construction of the north wing of the building, a part of the structure intended for the use of the War Department, ia being carried forward with all possible dispatch, and the work should receive from Congress such liberal appropriations aa will secure its speedy completion. T1IK .NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Navy sliows continued improvement in that branch of the service during the last lineal year. Extensive repairs have been made upon vessels, and two now ships have been completed and uiade ready for sea. The total expenditures of theyearended June SO, 1870, includingspeeiflcapproprialions not estimated for by tho Department, were $13,555,710 01). The expenses chargeable to tho year, nfler deducting the amount of theno specific appropriations, were $13,343,317.70; hut this is subject to a reduction of 5-83,725.09, that amount having been drawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year. The amount of appropriations applicable to the last fiscal year was $14 53$,(HQ. 17. There was, therelore, a balance of $1,470,054 37 remaining unexpended, and to the credit of tho Department, on June SO, 1870. Tho estimates for the fiscal veur ending Juno 30, 18S1, are $14,804,147.95, which exceeds the appropriations for the present fiscal year $301,807.28. Tho rcnaon for this increase is explained in the,Secretary's report. The appropriations available for the present Jiscal year are $14,502,250.07, which will, in the opinion of the Secretary, answer all the ordinary demands of tho service. The amount drawn from the Treasury from July 1 to November 1,1S70, was $5,770,404.12, of whioh $1,005,440 33 has been refunded, loaving us tho expenditure for that period $4,074,903.70. if the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds ol the year do not exceed the proportion for these four months, there will remain unexpended, at tho end of tho year, $477,859 30 of the current appropriations. The report of the .Secretary shows the gratifying fact that among all the disbursing officers of the pay corps of tho Navy there is not one who is a defaulter to the extent of a single dollar. I uuiio wiui mm in recommending mo removal of the Observatory to a inorc healthful location. That institution reMeets credit upon t lie nation, and has ob? taiued the approbation of scientific men iii all part* of the world. lta removal from its present location would not Qnly be conclusive to the health of its officers and professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness. JUDICIARY? MO HE CIRCUIT JUDGES XTIKDKU. The appropriation for judicial expenses, which has heretofore been inade for the Department of Justicc, in gross, was subdivided at the last session of Congress, and no appropriation whatever was uiado for the payment of the fees of marshals and their deputies, either in the service of process or for the discharge of other duties; and, since June 30, these oflicers have continued the performance of their duties, without compensation from the Government, takiui* upon themselves the necessary incidental outlays, as \frell as rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable instances has the proper execution of the process of tho United States failed by reusou of tho absence of the requisite appropriation. This course of pflic.ial conduct on tho part of these officer*, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the Attorney General, who informed them, however, that they would necessarily have to rely for their compensation upon tho prospect of future legislation by Congress, i therefore especially recommend that immediate appropriation be made by Congress for this purpose. 'I iim m't innl-ini? tlinnrincinftl nnnrnnrin- ' tiou for the department of Justice at pre-1 vious Bt'ssiotiH l)ununiformly contained the following clause: "And for defraying the expenses which may bo incurred in tiie enforcement of tlio ant approved February 28,1870, entitled 'an net to amend au act approvod May IIO, 1870, entitled 'An act to enforce the rifrfit of citizens of the United States to vote in tlio several States of tho United States, and for 6ther purpurea,'or any acts amendatory thereof or HUpplementarv thereto.'" No appropriation was made for this purpose fur the curreut year. As no general election for members of Congress occurred, tho omission was a matter of little practical importance.' Stich election will, however, t?ke place during the ensuing year, and the appropriation made for tho l?ay of marshals and deputies should be sufficient to embrace compensation for the services they may lie required to perioral at such election*). The buainwaol tbo Supreme Court Is, at present, h>r?el.v in arrears. It cannot l>o expected that more causes can be decided than are now disposed ol In it* annual session, or that by any assiduity the distinguished magistrates' who compose the Court can uccompiish more than la bo? done. In Uie courts ol many ol the ' "-t\ V* circuit*, lino, the business hu increased to such an extent that the deity of justice will call the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed that all Is done In each circuit which can fairly bo expected from lis Judicial force. The evils arising from delay are leas heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors, aa its causes are tdvanced by the courts when it is teen that they lnvolrt the discussion of question! of a public chiracter. The remedy suggested by the Attorney General Is the appointment of additional circuit judges and the creation of an inter mediate court ol errors and tppeals, wblct shall relievo the Supreme Court of a par of Its jurisdiction, while larger force ii alto obtained for the performance of dr cult duties. I conunend this suggestion to the con sideratlon of Confront. It would seem tt afford a complete remedy, and would ia volve, if ten additional circuit judges an appointed, an expenditure, at the preson rate of salaries, of not more than sixtj thousand dollars a year, which would cer tainly be small in comparison with tin object* to be attained.

PO8TOFKICM DEPABTMBNT. The report of tho Postmaster Genera bears testimony to tho general revival o buHiness throughout the country. The re ceipta of the Postofllce Department for th year ended June 150, 1870, were $30,041, U82 SO, being $704,405 01 more than th revenues of tho preceding year. Th amount realized from the sale of postal stamps, stamped envelopes, and posts cards, was $701,40-*) OL more than in th preceding year, and $2,387,550 23 mor than in 1877. The expenditures of th< Department wore $33,440,800 45, of whic tliesum of $370,401 03 was paid on liubili tios incurred in preceding years. The expenditures during the year wer $801,200 77 less than in the preceding yeai This reduction is to be attributed mainl; to the operation of the law passed Jun 17, 1878, changing the compensation < postmasters from a commission on th value of stamps sold, to a commission o stamps cancelled. The amount drawn from the l'reasur on appropriations in addition to the revt nuesof the department was $3,031,454 IN uuiuk ou it?8? man in inoprecet iug year. The expenditures for the fiscal year ent in# June UO,1881, are estimated at lltl) 820,000, and the receipts from all sourct at ?*.12,210,000, leaving a deficiency tot appropriated (or, out of tho Treasury ( f7,no,uoo. The relations of tho department wit railroad com nan ies have been hurmonizet notwithstanding the general reduction b Congress of their compensation, by tlj appropriation for social facilities, and tli railway postofBce lines have been great! extended, especially in the Souther Slates. The interests of the railway ma service and of the public would be greatl promoted, and the expenditures could L more readily controlled by the classifta tion of the employes of the railway ma service as recommended by the Toatmasti Genera), the appropriation for salarie with respect to which the maximum lim is already lixeH by law, to be made i gross. The Postmaster General recommends a amendment to the law regulating the ii crease of compensations for increased se vice and increased speed on star routes, i as to enable him to advertise for proposa for such increased service and speed. IJ also suggests the advantages to accrue i the commerce of the country from the ei actment of a general law authorizing coi tracts with American built steamers, ca rvingtho American ilag, for traneportic the mail between ports of the Unite States and ports of the West Indies an South America, at a lixed maximum pi mile, the amount to be expended ben regulated by annual appropriations, i like manner with the amount paid for tl domestic star service. The arrangement made by the Postraa ter General and the Secretary of theTrea ury for the collection of duty upon bool received in the mail from foreign coui tries, has proved fo satisfactory in i practical operation that the recommend tion is now made, that Congress shall c: tend the provisions of the act of March 1871), under which this arrangement wi made, so as to apply to all other duiiab articles received in the mails from foreig countries. THE 

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT-?THE INDIA QUESTION. The reports of the Secretary of tho Ii teriorandof tho Commissioner of India Affairs, setting forth tho present state < our relations with the Indian tribes o our territory, the measures taken to a< vance their civilization and prosperity aud the progress already achieved lj them, will be found of more than ordint ry interest. The genoral conduct of ot Indian population has been so satisfacU ry that the occurronce of two disturbai ces, which resulted in bloodshed and d< struction of property, is all the more to 1j lamented. Tho history of tho outbreak on th Whito River lite reservation in Water Colorado baa become so familiar by elal orate- reports in tho public pre?8, that ii remarkable incidents need not be state here in detail. It is oxpectcd that the sc t lenient of this dill lenity will lead to sue arrangements as will prevent further hoi tile contact between the Indians and Ui liorder settlements in Western Coloradc The other disturbance occurred at th Mescalero agency, in Now Mexico, wlier Victoria, the beau of a small band of m? raudere, after committing many atrocitiei being vigorously chased by a militar force, made his way across the Mexicai border and is now- on foreign soil. While these occurrences, in which comparatively small numbeatof Indian were engaged, are most depiorablo, a vas majority ot our Indian population hav fully justified the expectations of tlios who believe that by humane and peacufu influences the Indian can be led to abac don the habits of savage lile and to devel op a capacity for useful and civilued occu patioiiB. ? nat tuey nave already aucoin piished in the pursuit of agriculture am mechanical work, the remarkablo succea which liaa attended tho experiment o employing aa froightera a class of Indian hitherto counted among the wildest am moat intractable, and the general and ui gent desire expressed by tbein for the ed tication of their children, may be taken a sufficient proof that they will be founi capable of accomplishing much more i they continue to be wisely and faithfulii guided. The "Indian policy" sketched ii tho report of tlioSecretary of the Interior tho object of which is to mako libera provision for the education of Indiai vouth, to nettle the Indians upon farm lot iu severalty, to give them title in fee ti their farms, inalienable for a certain num ber of years, and when their wants an thus provided for to dispose by sale of tin lands on their reservations not occupici and used by them, a fund to be formei out of the proceeds for the benetit of th Indians, who will gradually relieve th Government of the expenses now providei fjr by annual appropriations, must com mend ilaelf as iuat and beneficial in 111 Indians, aud ?e also calculated toremovi thane obstructions which the existence o largo reservations presents to the settle uient and development ol the countrv. therefore earnestly recommend tlie enact ment of a lav enabling the Governmen to give Indians a title in fee, inalienabli for twenty-five yean, to the farm-landi assigned to thein by allotment. 1 also re peat the recommendation made In my Orsi annual message, that a law be passed ad milting Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having, by their own labor, sup* ported their families for a number ol years, and who are willing to delach them solves from thoir tribal relations, to the benefit of the homestead act, and to gram them patents containing the same provisional inalienability for a certain period. The experiment of sending a number of Indian children, of both sexes, to the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, to receive an elementary English education and practical instruction in farming aud other useful industries, has led to results so promising, that it was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the Interior Department # i for the establishment o! an Indian icho i on a larger scale. Ibis school has no ono hundred and fifty-eight pupils, i : lected from various tribes, and la In fi operation. Arrangements are alao ma' I for the education of a number of InilL ' boys and girls belonging to tribes on t i Pacific slope, In a similar manner, i Koiest Grove, In Oregon. These Instil i tluns will commend themselves to t ' liberality of Congress, and to the pi lanthroplc munlfcenco of the Amerlc ' people. I L,?t spring, information wan recelv ' of the organisation of an extensive mot i ment in the Western States, the obji t of wjilch was the occupation bv uui i Ihoriroil persona of certain lands In t Indlata Territory ceded by the Cheroki to the Government for the purpose settlement liy other Indian tribes. ) Un the 29th of April, I issued a proc mation warning all persons against psrtl 9 pation in such an attempt, and, by the i I operation of a military force, thelnvasi t was promptly chocked. It is my purp< - to protect the rights of the Indian Inha e tants of that Territory to the full extent the Executive power. But It wonld unwise to ignore tho fact that a Territc so large anil so fertile, with a populat! . so sparse and with so great a wealth of i usea resources, will ho found more < '' posed to the repetition of such attempts happonod this year, when the surroui ' lug States are more densely settled, a the westward movement of our pope lion looks still more eagerly for fresh 1st i io occupy. Under such clrcumstan ' the difficulty of maintaining the Ind ? Territory in Its present state will groa ? Increase, and tl?e Indian tribes Inhabit ? it would do well to prepare for such a b tingCney. I. theroforo, fully approve the advice given to them by the Secret! . of the Interior on a recent occasion e ?i i.. ?1..
