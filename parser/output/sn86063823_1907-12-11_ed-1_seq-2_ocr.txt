AMUSING ORDER. Albany (N. Y.) Argus, Nov. 25. The New York Sun lately published the following Washington dispatch: - "A federal officer close to the Presi dent said today that officeholders in the several states and territories wlio may accept election as instructed Roosevelt delegates would do so only upon pain of dismissal, but ft was added that there was no objection to political activity on the part of these officeholders in the primary conven tions. The embargo applied, as nearly as could be learned, only to actual membership in delegations instructed for the President. There is no objec tion to the election of officeholders as delegates instructed for some candi date other than the President." Soon thereafter, substantially the information above cited began to ap pear in other dispatches emanating from the most reliable "cuckoo corres pondents on the White House list. They were drawn out, undoubtedly, by recently published estimates indi cating that the majority of the next Republican national convention would be federal officeholders. Next came the announcement made on authority of Internal Revenue Com missioner Capers, after visiting the White House, that the President had issued no such restraining order, and would issue none such; and then on the heels thereof it is published that the President had elected Capers to the Ananias Club, and given out th following: - "It has been called to my attention that certain officeholders under your department have been proposing to obtain election as delegates to th national convention advocaiing my nomination or proposing my indorse ment at state conventions. This must not be. You will -.lotify such office holders as is necessary that their ac ceptance of election as delegates for the purpose of their advocating such indorsement will be considered a ser ious violation of official propriety and will be dealt with accordingly." Directly after the issuance of this latest pronunciamento. Governor Cur ry of New Mexico took luncheon with the President, and this is what he told the reporters about it: "I have not talked with the Presi dent about his third term boom. N friend of the President has to. We are going to have six delegates from New Mexico, and the six will be instructed ' for Theodore Roosevelt- I am not go ing to be a delegate, and I suppose no federal official will be, but I will be at the convention whooping it up for the President, The real friends of the President need no instructions from film. They can go ahead and do what they think wise and best for ais interest." What a funny illustration of the mutations and vagaries of the All Reg ulator in the White House. But other wise, what does it all amount to? Federal officeholders control the machinery of the Republican party in this state, in nearly every Southern state, and in many other parts of the country. ' It will not be at all neces sary that they cause their delegate choosing conventions to instruct for Roosevelt, in case he should decide to run for a third term; on the con trary, it will require the most abso lute and undoubtedly" sincere refusal from &lm personally to prevent them from winding up la the third term corner, whether instructed or unin atructed; any tyro In politics knows that At the Saratoga convention of 1906 a majority of the delegates and of the flow on Display Our holiday goods are now displayed on our counters Make your selections early Payton Drag, Book & Stationery Company.

KIPLING'S leaders behind Ihem had agreed upon a candidate for Governor, and his name was not Charles E. Hughes. Mr. Roosevelt at t!ie eleventh hour called Herbert Parsons to the telephone and said "Hughes," and within 15 min utes enough delegations had switch ed to make it certain that Hughes would be nominated. Why? Most of the leaders knew nothing of Mr. Hughes, and several of them knew him only to dislike and distrust him; but they were federal officeholders, and the big stick of fed eral patronage controlled them as per fectly as did Boss Piatt in his palm iest day. To have federal officeholders elect ed as instructed Roosevelt delegates, whatever may be the ultimate intent or plan of the President, would be rather crude and obvious, and it is quite an unnecessary precaution. NEW 

MEXICO PEOPLE FAVOR STATEHOOD. From Santa Fe Eagle. There could be no more positive proof that the people of New Mexico are in favor of single statehood than the earnestness of the meeting which was Sield in this city lst Saturday. No more representative meeting has been held in New Mexico in the advo cacy of statehood at any time than this. The joint statehood movement last year did not begin to arouse the people as the single statehood move ment has done, although it has been only four months since the single statehood movement was started by Governor Curry in his inaugural ad dress. The people of New Mexico want single statehood and they want it now. They are looking to the administration to give it to them, and if congress should fail to pass a bill providing for the . admission of the Territory the disappointment among the masses of the people will be great. The failure of congress to pass a bill of this kind will be charged to the Republican ma jority which has it in its power to pass the bill before the end of this year. Delegate Andrews should work early and late in the attempt to wjlp the Republicans into line. He now has an opportunity to show how much in fluence he has in congress. If he has as much influence as he is credited with he should be able to secure the passage of the statehood bill without trouble. fHREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MINUTE THE PENALTY. New York, Dec. 10. A penalty of three hundred dollars a minute, the heaviest ever imposed by the city, was imposed in a contract just signed with New York by the Edison Com pany. The company forfeits this am ount if it fails within three minutes after a fire alarm is given to furnish adequate power to operate the pumps from the city's new high pressure wa ter mains between - Chambers and Twenty-third street. The plant will be completed tomorrow. GETTING JURY FOR THE TALLMADGE TRIAL. The Federal court has taken the place of the Territorial court and will probably be in session several days.
