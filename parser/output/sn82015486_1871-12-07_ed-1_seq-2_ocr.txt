We have no donbf they voted tbestreight nepnb lican ticket so did we, from tI to bottom and we have no donbt they are at heart sonnd Repnlr licaus hence, we did not doubt that tbey pitched into na to enrry favor with the guilty one whom we had stirred np with a hot i'ker. And to this the BeniiMi'i-nse na Beam: &8ANBOttsreply; "You're another Sol. MlL I.r.tt is venal reeord the C kief liaa Sol. MlLLEli lias bolted ticketa in tbepast, whenever they did not anit him and nil that sort of thing. Aa to our record and reputation, they give na no uneas iness, and we hope Hi" Republican will not worry aboat them. And wo Mispect that all the venal ity we have exhibited, since BlULE & SAxnonx li.ivc known ids has been nothing oat of their purse. The remaining charge, of our having bolted tickets in the past, is a favorite charge, nosed over by every new importation that comes into the County to flourish for a brief season, and do his masters' ill to he kicked out as soon as he musters np independence enough to imagine that he haa a will of his own. For the benefit of the editors of the Republican, their informers and prompters, we will give a bit of history, showing how we bolted the Republican ticket. To begin: We have never bolted a regularly nominated Ke pnblican ticket or candidate. Republican County Conventions were regularly held in this Connty, from 1857 down to the commencement of the war, and in the years 151, 1J2, aud 153. There nev er was a bolt from n ticket during all that time there was harmony, and a united support of the ticket, with almost invariable sneers. Hut in 1864, an clement camo into onr Comity politics, that haa kept up discord and bolting ever since. In the year 154, a Legislature was to be elec ted, that would have the choosing of n United States Senator. Almut tho time a Comity Con vention was being talked up, a sijuad of olliccrs from tho army made their appearand- in the Coun ty, as they did in nearly every Comity in the State, wboliad lieeu furlonghed by Gou.ToM Ew INO from his division and his body-guard, for the purpose of returning to Kansas running fertile Legislature, and electing Jiim tn the United States Senate. These men at oucr put their veto upon a Convention. They would ran, whether or no; and if they were not given a clear field, they would divide the Anti-LAXK vote, and insure the election of Lank men, horn it was desired to de feat. The issne was then Laxk and Aiiti-LxNK, and there was a large Anti-LAXK majority in tho Comity. Rather than see such a result, the Anti LAXK candidates withdrew, in favor of this de tachment from the army tho latter pledging ing themselves to vote against Lank under all circumstances, n hetlier they could elect the man of their choice or not. So the Convention was net aside, and an independent race made. Several of the body-guard were elected, one was defeated, and the Lank men managed to take in most of the County offices. When the legislature met, it was found that Ewixg was a dead duck, and every one of his men from this County, in i iolation of their pledges, voted for Lank for what consider ation, there has been a pretty unanimous belief among the people of tho County ever since. We may remark here, that not one of those men lias been elected to office in the Connty since, and tho candidates they have f.ivored, have almost inva riably been beaten in Convention. But these gentlemen found the Comity offices filled by good Republicans, win-so places they -wanted for their friends. They had come home to rnn the Comity, and they determined to regu late things. In order to do this, their independ ent ticket arrangement wonld not do, for the peo ple wrre not with them. Therefore, in 13, they were hot for a Convention they could manage that. But the old County Central Committee, that held over from 153, would not ib the men did not ault them. So they travelled over the Connty, preaching up the necessity tor a thorough re-organization of the party in tho Comity, but received very little encouragement, except from theirownhangcrs-on. However, they were txtnud to go it; so they met in mass convention at Troy, and appointed s Central Committee of their own. There was no person present from Iowa Township, bnt they ran across an old seed in the street, who lived near the month of Wolf, who never" had, and haa never since, voted the Republican ticket him they inveigled into the meeting, and made a Com mitteeman for Iowa Township. Then they called a Convention, ami held it, and nominated a ticket of their own. They wrre Umnd to clean out the nest of thieves and rascals who ocenpicil the Comi ty offices. Tho men who hail lieeu keeping up the party organizatinn, determined they wonld not submit to the dictation of this-clique of upstarts, who said Convention or no Convention, as pleased them, and who coolly went to work to set aside the rrgnlsr organization, and form one of their own. They therefore pot forth nn independent ticket of their own, some of the candidates on which were veterans from the army, who had lieen disabled in battle, and had made faithful officers. We were a candidate on that ticket, and support ed It; and the whole ticket was elected by a tri emphaat majority. That was the way we bolted a Bepnbliran ticket. The ring-leaders of that Bogt who were thus cleaned out, were the aelf aaaae men who attempted to run the late Convcn tion,in this Connty, and who attempted to defeat a portion of the ticket because they were out-grn-eraled. - That is the whole hiotory of our Wring a Re publican ticket. And now, aa to onr threat of lmlting again. We gave notiee,a few week since, uai u any .or the men who went into tho late Republican Couvrntion, thus tacitly binding themselves to support its ticket, hut who. for pita, attempted to defeat a portion of the ticket, were ever nominated for office by the Republicans of this Connty, the CkZf would, bolt the ticket. We propose to stick to that text! Ta. oakKrltcn. Thrt season of the year is at liand, when every man whom tiie jrtiutrr owrn is after his money, nil tt hen ho nerds all that others owe him. We find it necessary to make ouranuual rail upon our mlwcriliers. Last Summer, a the reader Is aware, we en larged and Improved onr paper. We w ere forced -to get aew tyn-, for our oM drees was worn out; and while we were doing so, we endeavored to get the very beat; ami we made intptirreutcuts be yond what onr patronage justiBed, and, in fact, beyond what we were justly able to do. We eal enlatnl tint the irren-assir$trtronage the improve ment wonld bring, wwiW make np for the outlay. Our latnmagu has- been handsomely increased, bnt still not as much ns it should be, considering the increase at expense. A gnat many of onr subscribers ere J'et In arrears for one or more years. In order to keep onr paper up to its present stan dard, we- nmst have prompt payment from all. We nnrst ask, therefore, that every one who has nut dbno so, make payment in full, without neces sary delay. We wish to bring our business as nearly to a rash basis ris possible. An extensive criilit business Is ruinous to a newspaper. Those wln do not find the. amonnt of their indebtedness marked npon their papers, can ascertain it by applying to this office. Thiainvitation i general. i i m IV (iKiimik K. Clayton, of Ilmwn County, is again in trouble, Gkoihif. is always in trouble, and always has a petition in circulation, repre senting that he is an injured martyr, and asking that something that has lieen done to his discom fort be undone. Once it was the penitentiary that grieved him now he has been tnrned ont of tho Claj toiiville 1'ost Office, aud a Republican appointed in his place; and he has got np a peti tion, signed by all the men, women and children in his latitude, including the Kickapno Reserve, showing that bu is a wronged man, and that the good of the nation requires bis re-iustatement in the Post Office. Then ha fills ever two columns of the Hiawatha DUpalck with bis grievances and petitions, 'lie therefore prays for the emission of Skkman! XV We like the way Judge WKnn, of one of the Southern Districts of this State, jerks the fil ling ont of ancient humbugs and modern imposi tions. Some time since, he pnt the veto npon jail-birds and professional rascals testifying in his Conrt; and now he has decided that grand swin dle, tho Texas cattle law, unconstitutional. Wo have believed, from the start, that that law was got npin the interest of cattle speculators in Kan sas, and that the pretended ground for the law was a fraud and a humbug. We say, no emliar- gocs upon tn.de in aud through, Kansas. There are still other subjects that Judge Wrjin should try his hand on. , 3" The Atchison Patriot wishes there were more jonmals throughout the country, not so much attached to party. The 'Patriot is a nice sheet to deprecate attachment to party. Why, if the Democratic lawgivers were to solemnly de clare, as a new departure, that it is the duty of every good Democrat to live on night-soil, the ed itor of the Patriot would at once provide himself with a snitable liowl and spoon, and taunt the Radicals with being arristocratic and over nice! Slate leW8. I"? An inmate of the State Insane Asylum, who is said to have been respectably connected, recently nte aliout one-third of the blanket that covered him in lied, which caned his death.

IV Marshall County has jnst gone through tho second heat of her County Seat contest. Marys ville is victorious. She polled only almnt 1200 voti-s!

Rkyxolds, having at last got ap pointed to an office, publishes a long editorial, showing tho ad van! ago of appointing "Rcpresent atie Men," men of ability and influence, to im portant offices. Go slow; those fat places are mighty uncertain in Kansas. XV Tiie Democrats accidentally got a majority in the Indiana legislature, last year, and elected a State rriter. Hriias already stolen ovrrf20,000 from the Statr, which his friends term "overdraw ing." As soon as a Democrat gets into office, he goes to stealing. ' t iT HoRNKR, of the Chetopa Ad ranee, and SrK)N ER,of tho Humboldt C(o,'have recently been prosecuted for libel. The former had to pay 2 damages, and the latter $25. This should lie a warning to them to always tell the truth, aa we do. XV For the lienent of' the Atchison Patriot, which publishes an opinion of the Ckirf in italics, we will say that we consider a man who is right in some things and wrong in others, a much bet ter man than one who is wrong in all things.

We find the following in the Osage Mis sion Journal, bnt without a fnll statement -of the rase we are nnable to state what the farts were, exrept that Judge Webb has declared the Texas rattle law unconstitutional: From Messrs. Hutching &. O'Grady. who have jqst returned from, attendance on thr terms of court in Allen and Labette Counties, we get the following item : James C. Barrett v s. 31. Barnes at al. This rase was brought by plaintiff in Laliette County against 31. Barnes, sheriff, and John Ryane, Joseph Rov rmft and D. D. Bray, sureties on bis official lioud, to recovrr the sum of six t honsand dollars damage for Texas rattle taken from the possession of the shrntr, in l-aliette County, and killed by a mob. 3Iesrs. Hntchingt & O'Grady, attorneys for the sheriff, tiled a demurrer to the plaintiff's petition, raising among other points to constitutionality of theTexasrattlelaw.

Xot that we tbink.au v specific harm would come merely from this particular use of the dav; but we are opposed to anything which teuds to increase the already too great tenfenry to break down the obser vance, of the Sabbath. Irrespective of any re ligions nnestiou, wblrh we do not now and here discuss, the diftirnlty is that its srcnlari xation will tend to dimish Its prestige as a season or rest from physical labor; andjbis wonld he a consummation to be deprecated, for the rea aon that in this over active, and, as we sometimes ,mk 5,",V bny country, a very little opportu nity will set a considerable portion of pnidnrers at work on Sunday, thus complicating .the labor question, which. Heaven knows, is complicated enough alreadv." The Abilene Chronicle has lieen informal by Mr. Patrick Hand, who has jnst returned from a trip np the Solomon Valley to the Colorado and Ne braska line, that the new settlers have severely wiffered from the rold and storm. Mr. Hand says that the fall immigration info the Solomon Valley is unprecedented. Jlany fainiKcs arrived just before the late storm, aud the suffrring among them is terrible. -Haying."no nnnscs, they are compelled to lire in their "moving wagona," and the suffering among- the women and rhildreif, par iirnutny, is very severe. To add to tne nanlslnp of the situation, the ieople are almost entirely destitute of food; many uf them having scarcely tasted a mouthful ofbread since reaching the valley. They are tn ine to subsist mainlr niwn sneb mine, as they may lie able to sernre. Tins situation of affairs exists from Mitchell couuty northward and northwestward, up both branches of the river. The people of Mitchell connty have Hersey's mill at Iteloit, and there is barely grain enoughin that county for home consumption ; but in counties be- ond, the pmsieet is gloomy enough until a new crop can lie raised. 3Ir. Hand says that a great many animals have perished in the valley in consequence of the storm, ami that several mm were frozen to death. People were totally nnpreparrd for cold weather, not an ticipating that it wonld set in until some time in December. It is hoped that the old settlers in the Solomon valley will take prompt measures for the relief of the new comers. In some ofthecntsonthe Wathenai. Doniphan Railroad, near Petersburg, large quantities of pjriteaof iron aud thin veins of chalk have been found. The latter might prove profitable mining, if a vein of sufficient thickness ran be discovered. So the Wathcua Reporter thinks. The Clay Centre Independent says" that nn Wednesday last, Mrs. Payne, living nine miles north of that plare, had her house burned. It was one of the coldest mornings of the season. Noth ing was saved cxcrjtt their night clothes; and in that condition they were obliged to remain until her son went one and a half miles to procure help. Jlrs. Payne's husband is au old gentleman, seven ty years of ace. and haa been deranced for the last five years. It required tho ntmost endeavors of Jlrs. P. to keep her husband from flinging hint- sen into i lie names. Ills leet nave been oaiuy frozen. The fire sw opt ever thing they possessed in the way of clothing and household furniture. Their neighbors, as w ell as the citizens of Clay Centre, have ruqKiudnl liderally in relieving their wants. A school teacher in Fredonia, named Martin, lately whipjied a boy named McMhIijii se erely. In return young 3IcMahan's father assaulted the teacher, and broke the bridge of the teacher's nose with a stone. The teacher was fined f 10 for assaulting the boy, and McMahan was fined fcJO for assaulting the teacher. The Leavenworth Time is informed that last Sunday evening a shooting affray occurred on Kickaimo Island, above the fort, when one John T. Wilson endeavored to murder his eon, Wm. Wilson. He shot him in one of the anus, tho ball glancing aud striking him in the breast. The boy was removed to Leavenworth, taken to the hos- Cital, and a warreut issued for the arrest of Wilson y Justice Gould of Leavenworth. Tho boy will probably recover. The Saliua Journal says many rattle and horses have been frozen to death ill Sailnu county during the cold snap. Sixteen head of rattle wrre frozen in the stock yards at Sauna. William II. llrazel, of Greenwood county, and John Hutchinson, of Montgomery county, charged with counterfeiting, were taken tn the Topeka jail ittauicNia. Two Wichita stable men, named resiieetivcly Wilcox and Miller, got into an altercation with butcher knives, nn Wednesday last. Wilcox suc ceeded iu cutting Miller slightly in a couple of places, w hen the city marshal put in an appear ance and arrested both parties. Frank Hiiber killed a man at Oswego many months ago. He was tried at Chetopa last sum mer, convicted and senfenced to be hung. Gov ernor Harvey respited him, and tho supreme court granted a new trial. A change of venue was obtained to Crawford county. Oil Thursday night last Hnlter sletit ct t he Clorer House, Oswego, iu the same bed with his lawyer. J. Crirhton, Esq., of Chetopa. The sheriff locked them np and had tho key to the room, which was in the seceiul sto ry of the hotel. During the night a hole was cut in the roof, o er the lied room, and Hnlier escaped. At last accounts he had not lieen found. It is said he did the killing in self-defence. Fihst Daily Papkil We see it stated in a notice of Charles W. Helm that he edited the tint daily paer in Kansas, the Leavenworth Herald. In one sense this is tine, and in another it is not. As a K-miancnt paper it was. The Kanmt Free man was the first daily paper except the Daily Kama Tribune, published a week in April, le35, ever printed iu Kansas, and was started by E. C. K. Garvey, in Novemlier, 1855, and published during the session of the well known Toprka Con stitutional Convention. JMKrenee Tribune, Dr. Geo. W.

The Colnmbns Independent says: We are in formed that 3I:rjor I'pham's cavalry company, now stationed at Limestone, has lieen 'ordered to tho Arkansas river ronntry, to remove settlers from the Indian Territory. The company will start in the course of ten days. We hope, how ever, the weather will moderate Iieforc any action is taken in the matter, for the greater iortioii of them wonld rrrtainly suffer if they were removed now. We imagine that settlers will learn, after Iieing driven off a few more times, to keep ont of the Territory. The Wathcua Reporter says that sometime ago a young man named Fitzgerald was bitten by a dog belonging to .Martin .Mack", wlio lives lielow town. One day last week young Fitzgerald, ac companied by hi father, proceeded to the resi dence of 3Ir. Slack, and after breaking down the door, entered the house and shot the dog. 3lr. Slack had the parties arrested and taken before Esquire Dixon, last Thursday, who mulcted them in .the sum of (40 and costs, the whole amounting to $50. Got. Carney, the great grocer, sold his large warehouse on thernrnrr of Choctaw and the levee, Leavenworth, to.Cliarles Knnz,theemetient brew er. The consideration was$U2,00U. Kitnz is going to convert the building into a malt house. The hnilding originally cost $50,000. We have reason to believe, at the next session of Congress, arrangements will will lie made by which every settler on the Osage Lands will be enabled tn secure a title to his laud for $125 per acre. There is, in onr opinion, nn cause for fear. Jnstice will be done to the settlers. The whole matter has lieen laid before Senator Pomcrny, who is now in Washington, and with his earnest sup port, we have every reason to lieliere that-in no rase will the settlers lie driven off their Iambi. Walnut ralleg Time. As Rnfus Smith and family, recently from 31a ronpin connty, Illinois, were passing through the connty west of Oswego, on Saturday last, and whilst attemptingto crossonenfthemanystreams that intersect that section of the ronntry, the wagon liecame nnconpled, precipitating thr wo man ami xne cuiiureti into tne stream, over fen feet deep at the time, A little girl, six year old, and a lalie. eighteen month, were drowned, the mother and other children narrowly escaping a similar fate. They were dragged ont of the water byaropejthe mother, with the death-grip of a arent, still holding tn her bosom, as she snpimsed, the body of her ha!c,btit which proved to be her shawl! The postnftire. at Jewell City, was broken into last week and roblird of several packages of money.

Friday morning, which threatnied tnliecome serious. but it was finally extinguished without great loss. It was ransed by a defective fine in Dr. Perrine's quarters. The doctor's Ions was aboat $300. We are informed by the Neodsha Cithen that a young man named William G. Anderson came to NeodeahafrninXewton,onthc25th ofOrtolwr, in a wagon, with another man. He was suffering from a severe cold, contracted before his arrival here. ana wmieeampea near town, rapmiy grew worse; an miieh so that his companion brought him to tkeNeodcsha Honse. At this time he waa suffer ing from pennmonia, and was fast' sinking. lie waa an entire stranger in the place, bnt the pen pie about the hotel and a number of others in town tonic an intrest in his welfare, and treated him with great kindness and attention. Three days after coming to the hotel the stranger died. and on the day following was buried in the ceme tery, north of town. Before becoming nncon scions, the young man gave Dr. Blakeslee his name as iiluun b. Anderson, and his home as brinjr at Kosciusko, Mississippi. He also gave the doctor the address of friends at Kosciusko, to FEArartx Ettect or the Rrccrr Stob. Mr. Panghoru, correspondent of the Kansas City Jisms, writes to his iaper the partiealars of an incident of the late severe storm west of here. He -writes from Wamegn, and saya that reports from the plains concerning the storm are of the most har rowing nature. On Thursday. and Friday, hear ing a reKirt that thirteen men had been found frozen tn death near Hays City, he started for that jsiint tn find out aboat themotter. He says: Oil the train I found Orderly 8ergeant Harvey, of the Sixth cavalry, who left Fort Hays on the ttltlijn charge of a detachment for Leavenworth. He states that joat at dusk on thatday he discov ered six men, all of whom bad been badly frozen. Thry wrre in a ranch on the banks of Smoky riv er, about seven miles from Hays City, aud were suffrriug terrible agony.. Three of them were considered to be in a dangerous condition, while the others had fared but little better. The ser geant saw that tbey were well cared for and then proceeded on bis Journey. When near Five Mile' hollow on the old Santa Fe road, the sergeant's party came npon the corpse of a white man, ami a little farther ou that of a negro, both having per ished in tiie snow storm. These two had belonged to the same party as the six pre ionsly men tioned, having with them abandoned a train. Up to the time of bis leaving Hays City the sergeant reports the bringing in of seven bodies, and fears are entertained that as many as thirty-five or forty men have perished. It is known that full that number were embraced in the different hun ting parties then out, and as yet the company of cavalry searching the plains have not reported the discovery of a solitary man. Relics. Mr. W. F. Steele, while digging post holes on the grounds of John Marcus, of this of fice, unearthed the follow ingjnventory of aborigi nal relics: An old rattle-box, portions of a pair of moccasins, a chain with a medal bearing some indecipherable inscription and snrmnnnted with a crncifix, a pair of ear jiendan ts, a penknife, a glass stopper, with pieces of bone supposed to belong tn the human anatomy. There is quite an open ing in the earth where these relics were found, and it is not unlikely that it was tho grave of an Indian child, as the rattler and the moccasin, which is a small onr, wonld seem to indicate. Who knows bnt therarth In and around Cnnnril Grove is destined Iq time to come tn yield rich stores of Indian relics, and when the uohle Ka w shall have been removed to greener pastures or revel in the "happy hunting grounds" in store for all good Indians, and their existence here among ns become only a matter of tradition to the "oldest inhabitant," nn doubt relic hunters and humanitarians will flock hither from all quarters and delve in these destined classic grounds for evidences of the existence of a no ble race, by that time we hope utterly ex tic tf Council Grore Democrat.
