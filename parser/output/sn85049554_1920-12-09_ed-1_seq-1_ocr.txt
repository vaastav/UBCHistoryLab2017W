The round of social functions con nected with tho meeting of the" as fmbly.lri this city as varied by tlir marriage of Sir George E. Foa* ter, head of the Canadian delegation, to Miss Jessie Allen.

The strong opposition of the mem bers of the 'little entente" to the ad mission of Bulgaria into the league of nations was materially weakened this morning by the receipt by the commission on the admission of new stAtes of a report from Marshall Foch, saying that Bulgaria has ful filled her treaty obligations better than any other enemy country. Roumanla, Serbia, Czecho-Slovakia and Greece have been conducting a fight for several weeks against the entrance of Bulgaria at this time, submitting lon^r documents outlining numerous alleged violations of the peace, treaty by Bulgaria. Marshal Foch points out that Bul garian disarmament has advanced farther than that of any other state, her army now consisting of 23,000 men instead of 40,000, as contended by the "little entente." Final action on Bulgaria's applica tion for admission profoalJly will be taken by the commission this after noon. It is believed here that Marshal Foch's report may overcome the op position of the "little entente" and result in the admission of Bulgaria. REAR ADMIRAL MAYO RETIRED.
