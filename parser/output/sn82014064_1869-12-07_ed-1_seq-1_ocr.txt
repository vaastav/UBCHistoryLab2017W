TUESDAY, PECEMHKB 7, JBG9. ttte psEsissars oessaqk, Th e President’s message was delivered to Congress yesterday. Being the first an nual communication of bis views to tbe National Legislature, it will be read with great interest in all parts of tbe civilized world. After a few introductory remarks, the President takes up tho subject of recon struction, and gives a succinct narration of tbe progress that baa been made in that be half since tbe adjournment of Congress in .March last, which be considers, on the whole, loticffictory. In reference to the Georgia imbroglio, he recommends that Congress pass a law authorizing the Gov- emor to convene the Legislature originally chosen, and requiring the members to take the oath prescribed by law, thereby re- storing the expelled colored members to thc-ir seats, and excluding those who are ineligible under the Fourteenth Amendment to the constitution. Be recommends also that. Virginia be forthwith restored to her former place in the Union, and that her newly-ekcted Senators and Representatives be admitted to their seats in Congress. He exprcs.se* the hope that the acts of the newly-dectcd Legislatures in Mississippi and Texas will be such as to receive the ap- probation of Congress, and thus close the work of reconstruction. This portion oi the message, which is all of it that can be termed political, will meet the entire ap- probation of the Republican party, and will, wo think, bo satisfactory to the coun try. It is the natural sequence of tho election of last year, and it appropriately prefigures tbe close of the great work of restoring the Union on tbe basis of free dom and equal rights to all men. Tbe next subject to which the President addresses himself, is tliat of tho public finances. Be here enters a field which is evidently new to him. His most striking recommendation is that Congress shall pro vide for redeeming the greenback circular tion in gold by paying tho market price for thorn on the day that the law goes into effect, and increasing this price from time lo time at the same rate as tho interest which tho government pays on its bonds. If, for instance, tho market value of green backs should be ?.'• cents to tho dollar on tho day when the law goes into effect, then tho government should commence redeem ing at that rate, and should increase the price, so that at the end of one vear it should redeem at tho rate of Tti 1 .; at tho end of two years 81, and so on. This plan would bring tbe greenbacks to par at the end of five years. The most obvious objection to it is that it would bo on act of voluntary bankruptcy. The condi tion of the government at the present time is that of involuntary bankruptcy. Its demand notes ore oat, and it cannot immediately pay them. It promises, nev* ertholf-ss, to pay them in' full as soon as practicable. To pass a Inw providing for thc-ir payment at less than par is lo con* less either on inability or an unwillingness lo pay one’s honest debts, cither now or at any future time. If it is desired to retire the greenbacks without paying more than their market value, that object cun bo fully accomplished by buvirg them in the open market, bat to pata a law declaring at what rate, less than par, the government will redeem them, i.“, In our judgment, calculated to impair, rather than enhance, the pub lic credit, and to postpone, rather than hasten, the time when capital will seek investment in our bonds at four per cent interest. The plan is substan tially the same in its economical aspects as (hat adopted by England to restore specie payments after the war with Kapoloon. The government passed a law requiring the Hank of England to commence, on a cer tain day, to pay bo many ounces of gold for its five-pound notes—being something Jess than their par value—and to increase the amount of gold from time to time until the par value should be reached. In other words, the government recognized and as sented to the insolvency of the Bank of England (its own fiscal agent) and fixed the rate at which it should compromise with its creditors. We do not think, upon the whole, that this i« a useful precedent to follow. The United States con afford to sot a bet ter example to the world—the example of payieg all her debts at par. The govern went docs not know, and has no right to know, any debtor class, or any creditor class, or any other class. The only debts it can rightfully take cognizance of are its own debts. While it would he proper to arrange for the payment of its own debts in such manner us to produce no unneces sary distress in any quarter, It would be highly improper to take for the basis of its action the supposed condition of one class any more tfrfm .that of another. The President next takes up the subject of taxation. In view of the assumed feasibility of rc-funding the public debt at 4 or 4 £ per cent interest, ho recommends that th«re be no reduction of the existing rate of taxation until that event takes place. That the national debt may be ulti mately funded at a lower rate of interest (ban is now paid we have no doubt, but it can only be done after the existing bonds have risen to par. The rate of interest we shall pay depends upon the will of the lenders; and the will of the lenders is governed mainly by their confidence in the integrity and resources of the borrower : that is, the government. This principle, or rather fact, was set forth in the last Na tional Republican platform. Whether the people will consent to bear the existing burden <>f taxation until capitalists consent to loan us their money at 4 per cent is at least questionable. The President reeom mends that the income tax be renewed at 3 per cent. We presume that this sugges tion will meet the concurrence of Con gress. Coming to the subject of our foreign re lations, the President says that the Caban insurgents have not yet reached a condition entitling them to recognition as belligar •ents, and that the government has endeav ored to execute the neutrality laws in good faith. The views which he expresses on the Cuban question generally will meet tho approval of all good citizens. On tho question of tho Alabama claims, tho Presi dent takes a position calculated to increase rather (ban allay the differences which ex ist between this country and Great Britain. The indictment which he presents against England is almost identical with .that which Mr. Sumner gave in his speech last March, which produced so much excite ment in Great Britain. Tho President inti mates that no settlement of the Alabama will be satisfactory to him* which docs not embrace an apology, or something equivalent to it. Tho President urges a repeal of tho Teuurc-of-Offico law. The reasons which call for its repeal are very forcibly pre sented. We hope (although we do not con fidently expect) that Congress will respond to this request by repealing the offensive statute. The remainder of the message relates to the subjects presented in the several de partment reports, which we discuss hereafter.

There was rain this forenoon, sleet this noon, and snow tbia evening. The storm was ao severe and tbe waiting so bad.tbat the attendance at tbe Capitol was much leas than canal. Mr. Thornton was tbe onlyooe of tbe foreign Ministers present, though most of tbe others were repreieoted by their Secretaries. For half an boor before order waa called, tbe floor of each branch of Congress was thronged with people, and there was tbe usual amount of hand-shaking and congratulation- General good feeling prevailed, and tbe talk indicated a pleasant and agreeable session. All the galieilea were pretty well filled, but none of them were crowded, and there were noticeable vacancies in both the diplomatic gsltertea. among tbote on tbe floor oi tbe Senate, during the after noon, wexe General Sherman; Governor Lowe, the new Minister to China; Governor Bollock, of Georgia, and Governor Walker, of Virginia, becor Lemua, late bead of the Cuban Junta, was in tbe Senate gallery with a number of sympa thisers.

Leans looked very gloomy when that part of the message was read. Everybody was glad to hear the President reiterate his views ot last February cn the Alabama claims question. It will be noticed that they arc similar in genersl terms to these taken by Ur.. Sam* ner in bis speech on the Johnson* Clarendon treaty. Thcpilac'paJ dlscaiuoa in all circles is on tbo financial pan of the message and on the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The last named document was not read to Con* great, but the tenor of Us recommendations soon got abroad. Eastern members seem more gener* ally to favor the early return to specie payments than those from the West, many of whom tala about an increase ot currency. The President’# idea of redeeming the currency at a fixed price is identical with that presented some weeks ago by Ur. Garfield. The tariff men find the message roller more favorable than they expected It would be, more from what is emitted than from what Is sold. The suggestion to remand Georgia back to the condition It was In when the first Legislature assembled, took people by ear* prise, but it win probably be carried cat, and the bill on the subject comes np in the Senate on Wednesday.

It often occurs that revenue officers are lead to assert claims tn behalf of tbe government which have no jut looLiat.on in law or to fact for the roipcctlvc cater, and, where mil culms exist, it la oitec the object of the informer, and officers who share in the penalties, to misrepresent tbe case to the government, so as 'lO secure the greater advantage to themselves Botamoreseitouevllta found tn the practice of allowing persona a fraudulent course until a re sult Is reached which wtu inure to tbe be&ent ot officers and Informer*, instead of checking cnml- Icsi practices outside. It is impos*tbie to aet forth to exact language the character of the evils that grow otft of tbe present system. 1 am, how ever, clearly of opinion that tbe government ought to rely on pub'.tc officers tor tbe proper performance oi their duties, without stimulating them by any contingent advantages. I hare recommended an Increase of salaries of cuicom officers, and tbe abolition ol the system of giving them a share of tinea, penalties, aad forfeitures will be an additional reason for an locreare of salaries to this department of the public service, it baa become a practice for civrkiatd other persons who have held office la I the Treasury Department to accept employment I as agents or atterneya for parties having claims against tag department ;nd w t*. !!Cve ilia' £; CHI* Instance* the information ob tained while tn tbe public service bos been need in aid of the claimant*. Wuaout de tailing ad tbe objectlona to this practice, 1 suggest that a Law be pasted, bar nog pert-on* practising before the Treasury De partment, as agents or attorneys, tn behalf of the claim* that were pending wbeusoeb persona were officers of the department. In March hut there were employed in the Treasury Department at Washington a,&ts clerks, messengers, and labor ers, at a monthly cost of |2&&,Wl.rf. At present tbe whole number of such employes la %*4t, and melr monthly pay amounts to f»o, 23X51 —showing a decrease of expenses at the late ot tST.I6S.ht per annum. It wav found necessary, however, during tbe Periods mentioned, to increase the force in the Internal Revenue Office, and m the office of the First Comptroller. This increase, in the ag gregate, la at the rate of (50,440 per annua. This tdatcmeiA does not relate to the force in the Bu reau of Engraving and Printing. la Uarcblatt there were *ixtv-two special agents in the service of the department, receiving in the aggregate, for their services, the sum of (3*1.10 per Cay. Each of these agents made at* reports to the department, and acted under its direct orders. The number now employed is 54, and their daily pay (34iss. The pay of the agents has been increased generally, tn the hope tbit more efficient service might oe obtained. The eca coast and frontiers of the country, have been divided into sixteen special agency districts, and a superintendent appointed lor each. Assis tants have been appointed and detailed to act under the several district agents. Toe orders of the department are In all ewes sent to the agent in charge cf the district, and the report or his assistant* ore made to him. The agent is requir ed to make a monthly report of his doing! and of the doings of his subordinate*. The results thus Isr obtained appear to Justify the organization in troduced. ArrargemeuU have been mode for the manu facture oi paper for the currency ami other obli gations of tbo United F'aies, and for tbo piloting of (be same, which increase the security or the povernmeiil against the unlawful issues from gen* aloe plate*. under the eleventh section or an ac», approved June so, 13*4, entitled “An act to provide ways and means for tbo support of gar* eminent, and for other purposes," a pe culiar paper baa been designated as government paper, and by that act ft it made a felon; for as; person to bare or retain In bia possession on; use adapted to the making of obligations or secant; oi the Hotted States, except under authority of the Secretary ot the Treasury, or some other proper ornccr ot the Doited states. Arrange ments bare been made for the mannfsctnre of : ibis paper b; Messrs. Wilcox A Co., near Pall a-, deiphlo, and the mills owned by them, which are j exclumet; devoted to this purpose, have been 1 placed under the supervision of officers of i the government, and such precautions I have been taken for the custody of I portions ot the machinery as to reader It Im probable that tbe paper manufactured can be ob tained b; dishonest means. It Is received by an agent of the government stationed at the mills, and, upon requisition of tbe department, it la shipped to the National Bank Note Company, to the American Bank Note company, and to the . Piloting Bureau of the Treasury Department, aa the case may require. Arrangements have also been made with each of the tiro companies for preparing one set ot plates for every issue of currency or other obligation. The Engraving and Printing Bureau at Washington prepares a third set, and each office places an imprint on every obligation of tbe government. Nonce of tbe transmission or the paper from tho agent at tbe mills am! Us receipt by each of the several offices of tbe deliveries therefrom to tbe sealing bnretn in the Treasury Department, and alsoor deliveries to tbe Treasurer of the Coned States, is given each day by tc.egram or by letter, and on the tot* ionics day toe accountants in the Treasury De partment prepare a statement showing the dispo sition of every sheet of paper manmactored. In the mouth of November the paper at the ram and In each ct the several printing establishments was carefully coanted and tbe result compared with the accounts In the Treasury Department In an aggregate of about 7,000,000 of sheets re ceived by the agent at the mills, discrepancies were found to the extent of sixty sheets of irac ttoril caneccy paper.and tor the money value of wb.-tithe companies doing the work are re sponsible. It is believed that these arrangements furnish tetter security than has heretofore been had against tbo fraudulent issue ot currency or other obiigstionsof the government by the use of tbe original dies or plates, and the system of tbe irequent examination of the several establishments entrusted with tho work, wlu dis close at once any discrepancies in accounts. It is cot probable that the ebasges made win dimeo tsb the expense. Indeed the cost is greaser than It would be If the work in all Its branches was done in the Ttea«nry Department. In my judg ment, however, additional security is ot more con sequence to the government than mere economy in the expense of engraving and printing. The marine hospital service of the country is, open the who'e. in an ntuaiisfsctory condition, Several hospitals hare been erected at points where, at present, they aie sot needed, wnile great commercial cities like New York, FttUodel pMa, and Baltimore, bare to hospital accommo dation! for sick and disabled seamen, and a care ful examination or these inituuaoai has been made by Dr. Stewart, of the Treasury Deport ment, and by Dr. Billings, of the United Stales Army. Tbe result of these examina tions Is, that several hospitals have not been properly managed, others should be closed, and that should be erected at New York, Baltimore, and Psiiadel phla. Measures hare already been taken for tbe sole ol hospitals at several places where they ore not needed. The hospital at New Oilcans is rep resented as unsuitable from bad location and out er circumstances. The War Department is in possession ot suitable hospitals at New Orleans and New York, which, 1 am informed, are 00 longer needed for tbe use of the army. I re spectfully recommend that they be transferred 10 the Treasure Department. The revenue moriuu system U on important and expensive branch of the customs revenue service. Tncre are tnuty-slx vessels belonging to the de partment, of which twelve are tailing vessels and twentv-four steamers. They varv in sud from 4fo to tons; 173 officers and 2.400 men are required to man these vessels- and their running expenses amount to abont yssi.ooo a year. Five of these vessels, side-wheel steamers of 4.« d tons burden, are lake steamers, and out of com mission. They are rapidly dimmish tng in value, while the rare ot ’ them involves an annual expense of about |TO,ooo. The vessels now in service have been pare based and built at various times, and. os tar as I con ascertain, without special reference to the nature of the doty to be performed, and certainly without any matured plan. From one-half to three-fourths of the whole somber are not adapted to the busi ness. Congress recently appropriated poa,ooo for the construction ot tour additional vessels, and proposals were issued and bids received under the authority that conferred 00 the Secretary of tbe Treason; but no contracts hate yet been mode. An examination ot the subject has forced the conviction upon me that it is inexpedient to inenr the expenditure onai tbe department la m posses sion ot more accorate and complete information. I shall therefore take the opinion of a board of competent officers open the following points: First, the cue and character ot vessels required by the name of the service that they are to per form : second, whether they should be constructed ot tron or wood, or of a combination of those ma terials. When tbe report of the commission shall hare been received proposals will be issued for the construction of feat vessels as omnoritod. _ The addition to the parent Mint at Philadelphia, six branch mints have been established at various times in different parts of the country: One at San Francisco, one at New Orleans, one at Char lotte, N. C„ one at Dahlontga, one at Den ver, CoL, and one at Portland, Oregon. Since tne commencement ot the war the bronchos at New Orleans. Dohiooego, and charlotte have been closed. An assay office, it is believed, will satisfy the ceceaslUes of the mining Interests in Colora do, and, for the present, only a limited, business will be dose at the Portland Mint. Indeed, with the construction of railroads, and the consequently increasing faculties tor communication. 1 am 01 opinion that me business of the coming j ear wuJ be chieffy at one mint npon the Pscinc, and one mint on the AUontlc coast.

There are too changes in use organization of tbe Treasury De partment which I consider Important. Tbe flrst change to which 1 refer is tbe creation ot a Chief comptroller of tbe Treasury, who shall be au* tbonzed to control tbe system of accounting by tbe several Auditors and Comptroller* and to whom all appeals shall me made upon questions arising In tbe accounting offices of tbe I Treasury. Tbe creation of this office I clothed with tbe powers indicated will give unl- I fortuity 10 tbe accounting system, acd 1 trust U will be In the power or the officer apeatntedto simplify tbe system and materially reduce tbe ex* pensea of the department id this particular. Tbe second chtnge to which 1 cell attention u, in my I opinion, even more important. At present there I are eight divisions in tbe Secretary’s office, whose 1 duties are connected exclusively with the I customs revenue aystsm. There is no per* 1 son exce"* tbe Secretary tbe Treasury who Is Cy law iatibrixed to past flnsJJy j or in any way authoritatively npoo questions arising la the administration of the Cit terns revenue laws. At the present ttnie, the revenue from customs u as large aa the revenue from the excise system. Tbe number of men employed and tbe field of lu operations are nearly ns great. It Is impossible tot the Secretary of tbe Treasury to give toe vari ous questions that arise in the administration of tbe system tbat attention which u essential to 1 tbe goed of the service. The duties of superintending • tbe collection of caitoau I revenue are so varied, delicate, and Un- I portent as to Justify and require the exclusive 1 attention of tbe most competent person whose aer* | rice can be obtained. Tbe experience of the pres* I eot year in tbe adtntoutrauoo of tbe Internal Rev* i ezme system and tbe collection ot excise tax Jasti- I lies the opinion that tbe establishment of tbe office 1 of Commissioner of Customs Hevenae,correjpopd lug in powers aod position to tbat of Commissioner i of Internal Revenue, and the appointment o! a j competent Commisaioucr. would reader tbe ex* I eenuon of the customs revenue lavs much more 1 efficient and harmonious, while the revenue would probabiv be increased to the amount of maay mill* ions of dollars annnsllr, nor is it probable that tbe expenses would be materially greater. including interests earned and not patd, and deducting cash on hand, tbe debt of tbe United , State*, on the Ist of March last, was 98,3*3,453,- 1 soO.oi, and subject to tbe same condition, it was 92.453,669,735.83 on the l«t of the present month, stowing a decrease ot 971,908,5*4.74. Tbia ap parent decrease of the public oebt is less than tae actual decrease. Considerable sum* have been paid on accmni of war and other old claims not I previously aarerwined, and therefore not in* 1 cloded in an/ debt statement. Tbe ao* coact ot Match 1. from >“ ot the cate included oni* the interest accrued and net then payable, but, *a a matter of fact, there were outstanding and ovei7. , ue_ Interest coupons, and tbe several millions have ».‘oce been paid out ot the ordinary revenue. Preview to no interc*t;accouhta had ever been with me several loans. Such measures as wet.? ;°°° a , practicable have since been taken to ascertain tne exact condition of thoae amounts. Tbe bonds .- sued by tbe United States to aid of railways, amounting to 908,103,391), being in tbe na ture ot a loan, are not included In tbe foregoing statement. During tbe fiscal year ending June to, IS6B, there was an excess of receipts over expenditure*, including thg interest I on the public debt, of 94t.4aa.149.4ft. Of this tx- I cess, 918,998,370.03, as neady aa can now be aseer , tamed, arose previous to March 1, and the re* 1 mmnder, 135,400,779.43, between that time and tbe Ist day of July. Tbts excess was applied, from time to time, to the purchase of Mu bonds, and 1 tbe excess of tbe receipts since July l bat been 1 used in tbe same manner. Tbe purchases amounted in tbe aggregate on the 80th day of November to 176,47 ft, 490. A* a large part of tbe excess of receipts was realized in com. sales of gold have been made from time to tune and tbe proceeds applied to the purchase of bonds. With tbe cxcepUeo of tbe sale of moderate amounts of coin in Chicago, New Or leans, su Louis and Baltimore for the payment of duties, tbe sale of gold and tbe purchase of bonds have been made uniformly through the United States Treasurer in New York, aod without any expense to government except tbe comparatively small amount paid Tor advertising tbe proposals. Tbe average premium on gold sold since March 1 has been 83 8-10 per cent, and tbe average pre mium paid for bonds baa been Ift 78-ICO per cent. Upon this basis of tbe sales of gold and tbe par* chase of Donds, tbe average prices paid for bonds in cola has been 68 &MOO per cent. Tbe act of February 53,1868, provided tbat tbe com received for done* upon Imported goods should be annual ly ret spirt as a sinking lend to the extent of 1 per cent of the entire indebtedness of tbe United btaiets In coolormity with this requirement, I have purchased bonds to tbe amount of ttp,oU,&o and designated them as belonging.- to the sloktsg fond. These purchaser’ are a substantial compliance with the statute. Frca the 4tb of March last I have not felt myself an* thorued orrecuired to make any provision for the time tbst elapsed after tbe passage of the act, and previous to the commencement or the administra tion- With tbe excess ot means at my command I have purchased bond* In addition to those pur chased for the sinking fond, to the amount of 952,432,000. These are held as a special fund, sub ject to the action of congress, and I respectfully recommend that they be added to tbe sinking fund, and tbat any lonber purchase* tbat may be made be so added, until the gross aicoant shall consulate a fund equal to tbat which would have been created if there bad been no delay in tbe execution ot tbe law. Tbe depre ciation of the currency la doe to two causes: Pint, anfcxccsstve usoe; secondly, tbe want of faith m the government, and the extent of the influence of tbe fim-named cause cannot be as certained until tbe second ts removed substantial ly. Whenever out credit shall be so much un* moved at home and abroad that holders ot out bonds sre disposed to retain them when tbe public mind is excited open financial subjects we «n«n be able to Judge more accurately tbe extent of the over-issue ot paper money. It is also true that the quantity of currency necessary tor the transaction of the business of tbe country cannot tc fixed accurately, since the close of tbe war tbe wants of tbe states of the Sooth have increased, and consequently a large amount of currency baa been withdrawn from other sections to lupply tbe demand there created. The amount necessary for tbe purposes of the Sooth will steadily increase for the next two .vein. Tbe cccstrucUon of tbe Pacific Railroad lafflkely to refill to tbe t nbsutution of paper for coin by tbe people on tbe Pacific coast. It is probable that the demand for paper for that purpose will not be lef e than thirty millions of dollars’ As a consequence a very large quantity of coin win be withdrawn from circulation, and thus practically the coin will be increased upon the Atlantic Coast, and the patoer circulation's tbe Slate* east of the Eocky Mountains will oe matertauy reduced. These changes will tend to diminish the differ ence tetwren paper and coin. The ability of tbs country to resume payment will not be dns to any special legislation upon tbst subject, but to tbe condition 01 us industries sad to its financial relations to ether countries. These, of course, will be mere cr less dependent on the general pol icy of the government.

When this change shall have taken place the probability of our securities being sent home under the influence of (political or disturbances a England will be very bent: and when, as a concurring tact, out exports, exclusive of public securities, shall be equal to onr imports, specie payments nay be re sumed without even a temporary embarrassment to the business of the country, coder these cir cumstances Udoesnot seem tome to be wise to authorize tbe fan-ling of tbe whole amount of 6-90 bonds, wtocb, aa ts bow anticipated, will be out standing on the lit of Jnly next, t«t that IW loaoco at least should be suffered to remain either for purchase or redemption previous to 1574.

An essential condition to tbe success of tbe pro poted sew loan la the continuance of the present rtvenue avsttm. A chief means by which the present holders of ove-twenty bonds can be In dneed to snrrecder them and receive a bond upon longer time aod at a lower rate of interest lathe certainty furnished by tbe magnitude of the na* tional revenue that these bonds are toon to be redeemed. We must be prepared to oaa them the alternative either ot accepting the new bonds at a lower rate of interest or payment of prin cipal of existing bonds. when tbe five twenty bonds (ball have been funded to the amount of 1i.000.c00.000 or 1u500.000.000, the revenues can be reduced materially, sad yet sufficient soma be ratted to meet tbe ordinary ex penses of the government, to pay the interest on the public debt, and also to pay from tm.oou.ooo to 150,1-00,000 of the principal annually. Should oar success u negotiating the loon be equal to my ex pectations, based upon the fact that (bo abllty and disposition of the people of the United State* to pay tee public debt are a undent to justify as in assuming that the hoods of the United Stales will command the highest rates In the markets of the world, we shall then be in a condition to enter upon tbe work of reducing taxation at tbe com mencement of the next session of Congres*. On the seth of Jane, I*2, the amount of out standing s per cent certificates and compound in terest note*, convertible tniosper cent certificates was |7i,co<,S9u. On the 3cth of June, iso, tbe amount outstanding waa t&t,991,tt0, showing a reduction of fleets, *Bo in that form of Indebted ness. On tbe Ist of December, IMP. tbe amount outstanding was itlli farther reduced to (18,716,* ISO, showing a total redaction tn seventeen months of |ii 8*6,7-10. Tbe s per cent certificates are a substitute, to a considerable extent, for United Siates bonds, being largely held by the banks as a portion of their reserve, and thus, indi rectly, tboogh not to their 101 l nominal value, they swell the volume ot the enrreney. I recommend that provision be made for tbe redemption of tbe 3 per cent certificates witbiu a reasonable time, and os a compensating measure for tbe reduction la amount of tbe currency which would thus be caused, that authority be given to grant charters for banka m tbe btatea where tbe banking capital U leaa than tbe share to which they would be entitled to ao amount not exceeding |35,000,000 in the aggregate. The redemption or 3 per cent certificates aod the addition to tanking capital might be ao arranged as sot to produce serious dletnrbacce la the finances or business of tbe country, while additional banking capital would be topplled to the sections now to need of u, and this witbint any Ib crease of tbe volume of circu lation. There are two evils in the present banking syt ten which repairs remedy by prompt and etrident legislation. The tret is the practice on the part ofbanisor allowing interest on deposit*. The effect of the practice is that moacysm hands of individuals, which otherwise might be loaned for regular mercantile and 01 her business purposes, are diverted Into the custody ox banks, upon the idea that if the security is not better payment can obtain at s moment’s notice. Country basks, and others remote from the large centres of trade, bating received money on deposit for which they pay interest, are anxious to transfer such rands to other hanks from which they will receive an equal or larger amount of interest in return. They are stimulated also by the desire to place thelrlntda where they can be at all times com* manded. Thus influenced, large sums are placed on deposit with banks in the city, especially in the city or New York, which la the great centre of trade and finance for the Atlantic coast. In the otdinaiy course ot trade the currency or the country tends rapidly to the cities. It is unwise to cumulate this tendency by artificial means. Bat the (Til dees cot end with the impoverishment of the conn try, as the banks la the cities may be called upon at any moment to respond to drafts on ihclr depositors. They decline to make loans representing such land npon commercial paper payable on time, bat insist npon i mating call loans, as they are termed, with government bonds or other obligations pledged as eeonruy. Mer chants, generally, will not borrow money in large toms, payable npon demand. The consequence U, that moneys thus accumulated In city rank', are loaned to persons engaged in speculative per* amts. The extent o( this evil la seen lathe tact of the bank loans in the city or New York, in Oc tober, ire?. f 95,000,000 were npon commercial paper, and npoa demand, with a pledge of collaterals; ana In October, 19C9, fW.000,000 were npon commercial paper, and 359,000,000 upon demand. In the former year, 41 per cent, and In the .'attcr year, si per cent or the loans made by : the New York bonks, were npon demand. Afar tner result Is seen In the fact that parties borrowing money npon commercial paper lor legitimate commercial purposes, par from 3 tod per cent additional interest per annum as compare*? with persons who borrow money for speculative purposes. 1, therefore, re spectfully recommend that a law be passed pro hibiting, absolutely, the payment ol interest by the banks upon deposits, and limiting, Mao, their loans upon collaterals to an amount not exceed ing lo percent or their capital. lam satisfied, also, that the practice ot certifying checks, even when funds are in the bank, to the credit or the drawer or the check, is fraught with evil, and that tt ought to be entirely prohibited.
