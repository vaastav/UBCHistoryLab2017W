PRESIDENT TO CONGRESS Message Read to Both Houses of National Assembly LEGISLATION CALLED FOR Financial Standing of the Nation De clared Excellent Control of Cor porations, the President Thinks, Should Be Left to the National Government Labor Leaders Come In for Criticism Respect for Law Vital to the Well-Being of Country. Washington. The message of Presi dent Roosevelt was read in both houses of congress Tuesday. In sub- ' stance the document was as follows: To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: The financial standing of the nation at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the na tion's interests by the government dur ing the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. But our cur rency system is Imperfect, and it is ear nestly to be hoped that the currency commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. During; the period from July 1, 1301, to September 30, 1S0S, there was an Increase in the amount of mousy in circulation of 

?902,SS1,3SS. The increase in the per capita during this period was $7.05. Within this time there were several occasions when it was necessary for the treasury de partment to come t. the relief of the money market by pui chases or redemp tions of United States bonds; by increas ing depeslts in national banks: by stim ulating additional issues of national bank notes, and by facilitating importations from abroad of gold. Our imperfect cur rency system has made these proceedings necessary, and they were effective until the monetary disturbance In the fall of 19OT immensely increased the difficulty of ordinary methods of relief. By the mid dle of November the available working balance In the treasury had been reduced te approximately JC,06,. Clearing heuM asseel&tionc throughout the coun try had keen obliged to resort to the expedient of issuing clearing house cer tificates, te be used as monoy. In this emergenoy it was determined to Invite subscriptions for 330.0Oe.CW Panama canal bends, and $100,000,060 three pur cent, certificates of indebtedness authorized by the met of June 13, 1SSS. It was proposed to redepeslt in the national banks the proceeds of these issues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circu lating notes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was so great that it was necessary to Issue only &4.S31.M0 of the Panama bonds and $15. 36,50e of the certificates of indebtedness. During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 39. 1203, the balance botween the net' ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of the government showed a surplus In the four years 1S02. ISCt. ISM. and 1907. and a deficit in the years 1W4. 1W5. 1903 and a fractional part of tfc fiscal year 19U9. The net rosult was a surplus of $S9.2S3.413.54. The finan cial operations of the govmment daring this period, based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures, re sulted in a net reduction of the interest bearing debt of the United States from $9S7,I4J.e4 to $S97,253.9S0. notwithstanding that there had been two sales of Panama canal bonds amounting in the aggregate to S4,(31.99t, and an issue of three p'-r cent, certificates of indebtedness under the art of June 13. ISL'i. amounting t 515.436.5C0. Refunding operai ons of the treasury department undtr the act of March 14, 19W. resulted in the conver sion into two par cent, consols of ISCv of $20C..15.400 bonds bearing h'gher rates of interest. A decrease of fi.CS7.SZS in the annual interest charge resulted from these operations. In short, during the soven years and three months there has been a net sur plus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a reduction of the interest-bearing debt by ninety millions, in spite of the extraordinary x pense of the Panama car.al. and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual interest charge. Control of Corporations. As regards the groat corporations en gaged In interstatv business. and espe cially the railroads, I can only lopcut what I have already again and again said in my messages to the corrcsa. I be lieve that under the intersfjie clause of the constitution the L'nited States lias complete and paramount right to con trol all agencies of interstate i-ouimsrcf, end I believe that the national govern ment alone can exercise this riht with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from, and to do justice to. the great corporations which are the most important factors in modern busi ness. I believe that it is worsu than folly to attempt to prohibit ail com binations as is done by tl.y Sherman anti-trust law. becuuse sue h a law can be enforced only imperfectly and un equally, and its enforcement works al most as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that instead of an un wise effort to prohibit all combinations, there shall be substituted a law which shall expressly permit combinations which are in the interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to some agency in the national government full power of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features of this contrel should be securing entire pub licity In all matters which the public has & right to know, and furthermore, j tne power, noi oy judicial dux. oy execu tive action, to prevent or put a stop to every form of improper favoritism or other wrongdoing. The railways cf the country should he put completely under the interstate com merce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. The pewer of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, so that it could exercise complete supervision and control over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be summary. . . . Hates must be made as low as is compatible with giving prop er returns to all the employes of the rail road, from the highest to the lowest, and proper returns to the shareholders. but they must not. for instance, be re- ! duced in such fashion z.s to necessitate a cut in the w.-iq- s of the employes or I i he abolition of tlv proper and legitimate profits of honest -hafehoblvrs. relgrrph sn i telephone compani en raged In intvrv.aie cosiness should be put under the junsdh turn of the inter crate conmep-e trin is.ion. ' It l vp-y oam-stl to be wished That our people, through t?e r rnrfintat:ws. .-hould act In this matter, it is to The interest of all of us that .here should be a premium put upon lis- ! jl ideal initiative and individual cu- j pacity, and an ample reward for the great directing Intelligences alone com petent to manage the great business op erations or to-day. It Is well to keep in mind that exactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and the reaction ary the worst enemy of order, so tho men who defend the rights of property have most to fear from the wrongdoers of great wealth, and the men who are championing popular rights have most to fear f-om the demagogues who in the name of popular rights would do wrong to and oppress honest business men. honest men of wealth; fcr the success of either type of wrongdoer "necessarily in vites a violent reaction against the cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds. . . . Neefl of Centralization. The proposal to make the na tional government supreme over, and therefore to give it comolete control over, the railroads and other instruments of interstate commerce is merely a propos al to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes, if not the prime purpose, for which the constitution was founded. It does not represent centralization. It represents merely the acknowledgment of the patent fact that centralization has already coir.e in business. If this irre sponsible outsWe business power is to be controlled in the interest of the general public it can only be controlled in one way: by giving adequate power of con trol to the one sovereignty capable of ex ercising such power the national govern ment. To abandon the effort for national control means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to render like ly continual bursts of action by state leg islatures, which cannot achieve the pur pose sought for. but which can do a great deal of damage to the corporation without conferring any real benefit on the public. Tlre should be regulation by the na tional government of the great interstate corporations, including a simple method of account keeping publicity, supervision of the issue of securities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. There should be abort-time franchises for till corporations engaged in public business; including the corporations which get power from water rights. There should "nc national as well as state guardianship of mines and forests. The labor legisla tion hereinafter referred to should con currently be enacted into law. To accomplish this, means a certain in criwtse in the use of not the creation of -power, by the central government. The power already exists; it does not have to be created: the only question is whether it shall be used or left idle and meanwhile the corporations over which the power ought to be exercised will not remain idle. The danger to Amer ican democracy lies not in tho least In the concentration of administrative power in responsible and accountable hands. It lies in having the power insufficiently concentrated, so that no one can be held responsible to the peoplo for its use. Concentrated power is palpable, visible, responsible, easily reached, quickly held to aecount. Democracy is in peril wherever the administration of po litical power is scattered among a variety of n:un vvi.o work in secret, whose very nan.os are un known to the common people. It is not in peril from any man who der.vos au thority from tho pooplo. who exercises it in sight of the people, aud who is from time to time conipellud to give an account of its exorcise to the people. Legislation for Wageworker. There ara many matters affoctlir; labor and the status of the wagevorker to which I should like to draw your atten tion, but an exhaustive discussion of the probleai in all its aspocts is not now nec essary. I believe in a steady ef fort, or porhapa it would bo more accurate to say in steady efforts in many d:'eront direct: -as. to bring about a condition of aft air;; uudur which the men who work vith huna or w'th brain, the laborers, tho superintendents, die men who produce tl.a taurUel and tho men whs find a market, for tho articles produced, shull own a far greater share titan at present of the wuJ:h they pro duce, and be enabled to invest it in the tools and instruments by which all wcric is carried on. As far as j.,slb!a I hope to see a frank recognition of the advan tages conferred by macb.nery. organiza tion and division of labwr. accompauied by an uffert to bring about a larger share :n the ownership by wage-worker of rail way, mill and factory. Po'stil Savings banks will make it easy for tho poorest to keep their sav ings in absolute safety. Tho regulation of tin nat'onal highways must bo such that they shall serve all peoplo with "qual justice. Corporate finances must be uy,rvi.sud so as to make it far safer than at present for tho man of small in.au; ty invest his monjy in stocks. Tl..re must be prohibition of child la bor. . .minution of women labor, short- ning of hour.? of all mechanical labor; stock watering should be prohibited, and stock gambling so far as is possi ble discouraged. Thero should be a progressive inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial education should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten tho burden of taxation -n the small man. We should put a premium upon thrift, hard work, and bu5ni.ss energy; but these qualities coint! to bo tho main factors in accumulating- a fortune long before that fortune reaches a point where it would be seriously affected by any inheri tance tax such as 1 propose, it is emi nently right that tho nation should fix tli trins upon which tho great for tunes are inherited. They rarely do good and they ofton do harm to those who inherit thorn in their ontirity. There should no longer bo any palter ing with tho question of taking care of the waeworkurs who. under our pres ent industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a given busi msc. As far as concern:; those who have byen worn. out. I call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward providing old-age pen sions have been taken in many of our private industries. These may bo in definitely extended through voluntary association and contributory schemes, or through the agency of savings banks, as under the Massachusetts plan. Urgent Need of Reform. Our present system or rather no ays tem. works dreadful wrong, and is of benefit to only one class of peoplo the lawyers. When a workman is injured what he needs is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of relief through immediate administra tive action. No academic theory about "freedom of contract" or "consti tutional liberty to contract" should be permitted to interfere witli this and similar movements. Pending a thoroughgoing investiga tion and action there is certain legis lation whicli shsuld be enacted at once. The law. passed at the last session of the congress .granting compensation to certain classes of employes of the gov ernment .should be extended to include all employes of the government and should be made more liberal in its terms. There is no good ground for the distinction made in the law be tween those engaged in hazardous oc cutiatidiis and those not o m- g.igd. Tho terms of the act pro- vidieg compensation should be mad more liberal than in the pr.s-iit act. A year's compensation not ade- i i;uate for a wagi. -earner s la:r.:!y in the event of his death by sc-eidont in the course of u!s employment. And in the ovent of death occurring, say. ten or eleven months sfter the ciee nt. tne family wttM only rrrjv as ompen fc&lion the equivalent ef jpno or tws months' earning. In this respect the generosity of the United States towards its employes compares most unfavora bly with that of every country in Eu rope even the poorest. I renew my recommendation made in a previous message that half-holldaya be granted during summer to all wage workers in government employ . I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day phould as rapidly and as far as practi cable be extended to the entire work being carried on by the government; the present law should be amended to embrace contracts on those public works which the present wording of the act seems to exclude. Would Double Salaries of Judges. I most earnestly urge upon the con gress the duty of increasing the totally inadequate salaries now given to our judges. On the whole there is no body of public servants who do af valuable work, nor whose moneyed reward is so Inadequate compared to their work. Be ginning with the supreme couit the judges should have their salaried dou bled. It is not befitting the dignity of the nation that Its most homnd public servants should be paid s'i:r. im -n".ai' compared to what they wr-:!d tarn in private life that the pr''ir::i:in'-e of public service by them ir:.p!ifs un ex ceedingly heavy pecuniary -erif:ce. It is earnestly to be desired that sm method should be devised for doinT away with the long delays which n iv obtain in the admiiii?t ration of jusricf. and which operate with peeuMar sever ity against persons of srri'll meani. ano favor only the very criminal whom It is most desirable to punish. These long delays in the final decisions of casts make in the aggregate a eryirrr evil: and a remedy yli'ui.i be devised Much of litis intolerable rtelay i. due to improper regard paid to technicali ties which sre a mere hindraiioe to justice. In some not'd recent -r.si-s tiii over-regard f-r tr-ii:ii-. a 'itlt-s ha? re sulted in a striking denial of justice, and flagrant wrong to tl.- body poiitic Labor Leaders Criticised. At the la?t election certain le-iders of organized ln'sor made a viohnt an-! j weeping attack upon the ntire judi ciary of the country, jin attack couched in such terms as to include the most upright. honest and broad-minded judges, no less than thfse of narrower mind and more istr:cted outlook. Last year, before the house com mittee on juclciary. these sam labor leaders formulated tiieir de mands, specifying the bill tha" contained thrm. refusing- all compro mise, stating they wished the principle of that bill or nothing. They insisted on a provision that in a labor disput no injunction should issue except to protect a proptrty right, and specifical ly provided that the right to carry on business should not be construed aa a property right; and in a second provis ion their bill made legal in a labor dis pute any act or agreement by or be tween two or more persons that would not have been unlawful if done by a single person. In other words, this bill legalised blacklisting and boycotting in every form, legalising, for instance, those forms of the secondary boycott which the anthracite coal strike com mission so unreservedly condemned; while the right to carr on a business was explicitly taken out from under that protection which the law throws over property. The demand was made that there should be trial by jury in contempt cases, thereby most seriously impairing the authority of the courts. All thia represented a course of policy which. If carrit-d out. would mean the cnthronement of class privilege in its crudest and most brutal form, and the destruction of one of the most essen tial fjnetione of the judiicary in all civ ilized lanJ. Tlu- violence of the crusade for this !e;"iaiation. and its complete failure, illustrate two truths which it is essen t in I our people should learn. In the firs--t pis ce. limy ou;Tht to teach the vov!:ini,.aan. the laborer, the wage worker, that by demanding what is im .iru','r and impossible lie alay into the hands ef hie foes. Such a crude and vicious attsek upon the courts. von if it were temporarily successful, would Inevitably in the end cause a violent reaction and would band the great mass of citizens together, forcing them to stand by all the judges, competent and incompetent alike, rather than to see the wheels of justice stopped. The wageworkers. the workingmen. the laboring mn of the country by the way in which they repudiated the ef fort to get them to cast their votes in response to an appeal to class hatred, have empbesized their sound patriotism and Americanism. Such un attitude is an object lesson in gocd citizenship to the entire nation. Judicial System Sound. Our judicial system is sou'id and ef"e:iv at cor. and it remains, and must ever be maintained. as he safeguard of those prim iples of lib fity and justice which stand at the foundation of American institutions; for. as P.ur!:e finely said, whan iibsrty and justice are separated, n-it?'er i safe. There' are. however, some mtnibwrs of the judicial body who have lagged be hind in lhir understanding of these great and vital changes in Ihj body politic, whose minds have noser been upeiu'd to the new applications of the old pri:i ipies made necessary by tho ncv eondi'ienr. Jvcfgs of this stamp do last ing harm by their decisions, because they convince poor men in need of protection tl at the courts of the land are pro foundly ignorant of and out of sympathy with their me'-', and profoundly ignorant or hostile' to any proposed remedy. To such men it veetus a cruel moc'tory to have any court decide against them on the ground that it desire- to preserve "liberty' in a purely technical form, by withholding liberty in any real and con structive sense There are certain decisions by various courts which have been exceedingly det rimental to the rights of ware-workers. This is true of all decisions tlikt decide that men are, by the constitution, "guar anteed their liberty" to contract to enter a dangerous occupation, or to work an undesirable or improper number of hours, or to work in unhealthy surioundings; and therefore cannot recover damages when maimed in that occupation, and cannot be forbidden to work what the legislature decides is an excessive num ber of hours, or to carry on the work under conditions which the legislature decides to be unhealthy. Derisions such as those nullify the legislative effort to protect the wage-workers who most need protection from those employ ers who take advantage of their grind ing need. They halt or hamper the move ment for securing better and more equi table conditions of labor. There is also, I think, ground for the belief that substantial injustice is often sufferrd by employes in consequence of the custom of courts issuing temporary injunctions without notice to them, and instances where, as a matter of fact, ! they have no knowledge of any proceed-1 ings. Organized labor is chaflnj under the unjust restraint which comes from repeated resort to thi plan of procedure. Its discontent has been unwisely expressed. and often improperly expressed, but thcrs is a sound basis for it, and the or derly ar..1 law-abiding people of a com munity wcitM be in a far stronger posi tion for uphoid'nir the court if the un doubtedly existing nhuses could be pro vided against. ! Injunction Must Rcmsin. j The power cf injunction is a greai editable rwr.ody. which should on irt ! scoc-ant 4estroyc.4v Bu,t efcfeufr.i"i 1 should be erected against its abuse. In substance, provision should be made I that no injunction or temporary re straining order issue otherwise than on notice, except where irreparable injury would otherwise result: arid in such case a hearing on the merits of the order 1 should be had within a short fixed pe riod, and. if not then continued after hearing, it should forthwith lapse. De cisions should be rendered immediately, and the chance of delay minimized in every way. Moreover, I believe that the procedure should be sharply defined, and the Judge required minutely to state the particulars both of his action and of his reasons therefor, so that the congress an if it desires examine and investigate the same. For many of the shortcomings of justice in our country our people as a whole are themselves to blame, and the judges and Juries merely bear their shart together with the public as a whole. It is discreditable to us as a people that there should be difficulty in convicting murderers, or in bringing to justice men who as public servants have been guilty of corruption, or who nave profited by the corruption of public servant. The result is equally unfortunate, whether due to hairsplit ting technicalities in the interpretation f law by judges, to sentimentality and lass consciousness on the part of juries, or to hysteria and sensational ism in the daily press. For much of ti'is failure of Justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such. Wo who make up the mass of the people cannot shift the responsibility from our own shoulders. Hut th-re is an impor tant part of the failure wi..eh has spe cially to do with inability to hold to proper account men of wealth who behave badly. The Modern Corporation. The huge wealth that lias been nccu riifated by a few individuals of recent vars. in what has amount fd to a so- ril and industrial revolution, has Veen is regards some of these individuals :(! possible only by the improper use f the modern corporat.c:i. A certain : -? of modern corporation, with its I cfrs and agents, its many issue? of "Miritics. and its constant consolida tion with allied undertakings, finally " i correi an instrument so complex as - contain a greater number of ek fnts that, under various judicial de-:'-:on. lend themselves to fraud and n-rssion than any device yet evolved n the human brain. Corporat'i:s are "ei-ss.-ry instruments of modern busi ness. Thy have been permitted to t-'co-rf n menace largely because tho T'lvernmental representatives of tho ople have worked slowly in provid . si for adequate control o:cr them. Our griat clusters of corpora tions, huge trusts nnd fabulously wealthy multimillionaires, employ the very best lawyers they can obtain to pick flavs in statutes after their passage; but they also employ a class of secret ngents who seek, under the advice of experts, to render hostile legislx.ion innocuous by making it un constitutional, often through the inser tion of wh.-tt appear on th-ir face to bo drastic and sweeping provisions against the interests of the parties inwpirlng them: while the demagogues the cor rupt creatures who introduce black mailing chetr.es to "strike" corpora tions, and all who demand extrt:ne. and undesirably radical. measures, show tieiueles to be the worst ene mies of the very public whoae loud mouthed chameions they proftss to be Rest darneffe has been done by the manifeld and conflicting interpretations oi the interstate commerce law. Con trol over the great corporations doing interstate business can be effective only if it is vsstes with full power In an administrative department, a branch of the federal executive, carrying out a federal law: It can never be effective if a divii4 responsibility is left in both the states and he nation; it can never be effective if left in the hands of the courts te be decided by lawsuits. Keep est fer Law Must Be Upheld. The courts hold a place of peculiar and Reserved saHctlty under our farm of gov "rnnient. Respect for tho law is essen ial te the permanence of our institu tions: ana respect for the law is largoly conditlonee upon respect for the courts. It is an offense against the re-public to say anything which can weaken this re spect, save for the gravest reason and in the moat carefully guarded manner, in no other nstlen in the world do the -courts wield such vast and far-reaching power as in the United States. All that U nec essary is that the courts as a wtit' should exercise this power with the far sighted wisdom already shown by those judge who scan the future while thoy act in tho present. Let thrn exercise this great power not only honestly and bravely, but with wifie insight into the needs and llxsd purposes of the people, so that they may do justice, and work equity, so that they may protect ull per sons in their rights, ami yet bre-aU down tin- barriers of privilege, which is the foe of right. Fore3t Frasarvatian. If there is any one duty which more than another we owe It to our children to perform at once. It is to save the for Vs of this country, for they constitute tiie first and most important element in the conservation of the natural re- euices of tho country lust as a fi.rmer. after all his life making his living from his farm, will, if he is an ex 1. rt farmer. Isuvo it as un asset of In creased value to his son. so we should leave our national domain to our chil dren, increased in value and not worn oit. There are small suctions of our own country, in the ea3t and In the west, in the Adirondacks. the White mountains and the Appalachians, and in tha Rocky mountains, whore we can already see for nurEtlve the damage in the shape of P'-rmanent injury to the so'il and the rner systems which comes from reckless deforestation. It matters not whether this deforestation is due to the uctual reckless cutting of timber, to the fires th&t inevitably follow such reckless cut ting of timber, or to reckless and uucon trolled graaing, especially by the great migratory bands of sheep. the un checked wandering of which over the country means destruction to forests and disaster to the small home-makers, the settlers of limited means Thanks to our own recklessness in the use of our splendid forests, we have already crossed the verge of a timber famine in this country, and no measures that we now take can. at least for many years, undo the mischief that has already been done. But we can pre vent further mischief being done; and it would be in the highest degree reprehen sible to let any consideration of tem porary convenience or temporary cost interfere with such action, especially as regards the national forests which the nation can now, at this very moment, control. The lesson of deforestation in China is a lesson which mankind should have learned many times already from what ; has occurred in other places. Dcnuda- i tion leaves naked soil; then gullying cuts down to the bare rock; and mean- j while the rock-waste buries tho bottom- lands. When the soil is gone, men must go: and the process does not take long. ; Plea for Inland Vaterway8. Actinn should be begun forthwith, dur- j ing the prtsent session of the congress, J f.-r :he improvement of our Inland wafr- ( v.ayc r.ctton which will result in giving j vs not only navigable but navigated i river?. ; Until the work of river Improvement Is i urdcrtaken in a modern rcay It can not have results that will mset the need? of this modern nation. The plan j Tttdca jp;oii;lscts the b?si &jp& qvJcV et results Is that of a per manent commission authorized to co-ordinate the work of all the government departments relating to waterways, and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. Under such a commission the actual work of construc tion might be entrusted to the reclama tion Mrv'-e; or to the military engineers acting with a sufficient bymbr of civili ans to continue the work m time of war; or it might be divided between the rec lamation service and the corps of en gineers. Funds should V provided from ?urrent revenues if it Is deemed wise jtherwise from the sale of bonds. The essential thing Is that the work should go forward under the best possible plan, and with the least possible delay. The time for playing with our waterways is past. The country demands results. The president urges that national parks adjacent to national forests be placed under the control of the forest service of the agricultural depart ment; he also points out the benefits derived from pure food legislation. The message continues: Needs of the Secret Senice. Last year an am-ntlment wis in. or porated in the measure prmiuing for the secret ser. 're. which provided rfiat there should be no detail from the sc.-ret serv ice aud no transfer therefrom. The amendment in question was of benefit to no one -rrc::itirr to criminals, and it seriously hamper" the government in tlie defection of crime and the securing of justi e. The hief argument in favor of :!.( provision was t'.iat the congressmen did not them selves wish to lie investigated by the secret service men.

Srvings Banks. I again renew my rornmendatio: for postal savings banks, for depos.t ing saving.-, with the security of tu government behind them. 'I he. objee is to encou-r thrift and economy i' the Tvage-f-iraer and person of mod crate means. It is believed that in th asgreate :-s si.r.is of m- ney woi.id b brought ii o i in-i:i-i:ion through the in rtrrn entai.ty of the pistai saving banks. Parcel Pest. In my last annual message T com mended tiie postmaster-gc neral'f recommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural routes. The establishment of a local parcel po-t on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and the cour.tr storekeeper, and it is desirable th-.t the routes, serving more thin iS.flftfl.eCC people, should be utilized to the fullest practicable extent. Education. With the Jirr-ited means hitherto pro vided tho bureau of c duration has rendered .'flicert service, but th con gre.'is has nesl-cted to adequately sap ply the bureau with means to meet the educational growth of the country. 1 eariH'i,:ly tuc ime-id that th:s un fortunate st:'e of aff-iirs as re-nrd the national e It. .-atioual ifes- be reme died by udt quite appropriations. This recommendation is urged by the repre sentatives of our common school" and great state universities and the teaOinj; educators, who all unite in requesting faorable consideration and action by the congress upon this subject. The president points out the neces sity of better organization of th vari ous bureaus responsible for the public health, aud urges the placing of all soldiers' bomts under the jurisdiction of the war department. Statehood. On the question of statehood the president says: I advocFtc the immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states. This should be done at the present session of the congress. The people of the two ter ritories have made it evident by their votes that they will not cmnie in as one state. The only alternative is to admit tlu-m as two. and I trust that this will be done- without delnv. Interstate Fisheries. I call the attention of the congress to the importani e of the problem of the fisheries in t lie interstate waters. On the Oreut Iakes we are now. under the very wise treaty of April 11 of tiiis year, en deavoring to come to an iniernitional agreement for the preservation and sat isfactory un- hi the fisheries of these wa ters which can not otherwise be achieved, lake Erie, for example, has the richest fresh water fisheries in the world; but it is now controlled by the statutes of two nations, four states, and one province, and this province by two different ordi nances in different counties. All these political divisions work at cross pur poses, send in no case can they achieve protection to the fisheries, on tiie one hand, and justice to the localities and in dividuals on the other. Foreign Affairs. This nation's foreign policy is based oi' the theory that right must be done between nations precisely as between individuals, nnd in our actions for the last ten years we have in this mattei proven our faith by our deeds. We have behaved, and are behaving, to wards other nations, as in private life an honorable man would behave to wards his fellows. Latin-American Republics. The commercial and material prog ress of the 20 Latin-American republic! is worthy of the careful attention ol the congress. The International Bureat. of the American Republics is doing a useful work in making these nations and their resources better known tc us. and in acquainting them not onlj with us as a people and with our pur poses towards them, but with what we have to exchange for their goods. Panama Canal. The work on th Panama canal Is be ing done with a speed, efficiency anc entire devotion to duty, which make il a model for all work of tho kind. The men on the Isthmus, from Col. Goethali and his fellow commissioners througr the entire list of employes who are faithfully doing their duty, have wnr their riicfct to the ungruclgintr resnect and gratitude of the American people I Ocean Mail Lines. I again recommend the extension ot tho ocean mall act of 1351 30 that satis factory American ocean mail lines tc South America. Asia, the Philippines and Australasia my be established Hawaii. I call particular attention to the Ter ritory of Hawaii. The Importance o! those islands 1 nonar'nt. and the ii-ec of Improving ihc-ir condition and . de veloping their resources is urgent. The Philippines. Real progress toward self-government Is being made in the Ph.iipp'r.- island I trust that within a ge-ri"T rir the time will srrive vrhn th r'l.'rps.r."? j sac dccJda fcr theiaslv2 whether it u well for thrm to become independent, 09 to rontinue under the protection of a strong and disinterested power, able to guarantee to the islands order at home and protection from foreign invasion, j Porto Rice, t 1 again recommenu that American cit izenship be conferred upon the people cf. ' f'cric Rico. Cuba. ! Tvi Cuba our occupancy will ceas- la i about two months" time: th Cubans I have in orderly manner elected their own ; governmental authorities, and the island j will be turned over to them. Our oceu I pation on this occasion has lasted a lit tle over two years, and Cuba has thriv en and prospeied under it. Our earnest hono and one des?re is that t-hi norilA of the island shall new govern them , selves with justice, co that peace and or- der may he secure. Japanese exposition. The Japanese government has post poned until 1917 the date of the great international exposition, the action be ing taken so as to insure ample tlm in which to prepare to make the expo sition all that it should be made. The American commissioners have vlsitect Japan and the postponement will mere ly give ampler opportunity for Ameri ca to be represented at the exposition. Not since the first international expo sition has there been one of greater importance than this will b marking, as it does, the fiftieth anniversary ot the ascension to tho throne of the em peror of Japan. The extraordtnary leap to tho foremost place among the. nations of the world maele by Japan during this half century is something unparr.llel-d in all previous history. I take this opportunity publiclj to state my appreciation of the way in which in Japan, in Australia. In New Zealand, and in all the states of South America. tha battle fleet has been re ceived on its practice voyage aroutul the world. The American government mn not too stromrly express it appre- ::Uiou of the a'umndin' and generous hospitality shown our jhi;,s in evetl port th- y visit d. The Army. As re-ri-ils tin- army T call attention to the f:ict that while our junior offi cers ant' enlisted men stand very high, the pres. nt system of promotion by seniority results in bringing into the higher graci-s many men of mediocre capacity who have but a short time to serve. Xo man should regard it as his vested right to rise to the highest rank: 'n the army any more than in any o'her profcps'on. It is a curious and bv no means creditable fact that thera should be so often a failure on ths part of the public and its representa tives to understand the great need, freim tho standpoint of the service an5 the nation, of refusing to promote re spectable, elderly incompetents. The higher places should bo given to the most deserving men without regard t seniority; at least seniority should be treated as only one consideration. In the stress of modern industrial com petition no business firm could succeed, if those responsible for its management were chosen simply on the ground that they were tho oldest people in its em ployment: yet this is the course advo cated as regards the army, and re quired by law for all grades except those of general officer. As a matter, of fact all of the h:st officers In the highest ranks of tho army are those who have attained their present posi tion wholly or in part by a process of selection. Tho scope of retiring boards should bo extended so that they could con sider general unfitness to command for any cause, in order to secure a far more rigid enforcement than at present in tho elimination of officers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities. But this p!an is recommended only if tr.e congress docs not see fit to provida what in my judgment is far better, that is. for selection in promotion, and for elimination for age. OtRcers who fail to attain a certain rank by a cer tain age. should be retired for In staneer. if a man should not attain field ran!: by tho time he is 45 he should of course ho placed on the re tired list, t'eneral officers should be selected as at present, and ono-third of the other promotions should be made by selection, the selection to be made by the president or secretary of war from a list of at least two candi dates proposed for each vacancy by a. board of ollicers from the arm of the service from which the promotion is to be made. A bill is now before the congress havinsr for its object to se cure the promotion of officers to vari ous grades at reasonable ages through a process of selection, by boards of of ficers, of the least efficient for retire ment with a percentage of their pay depending upon length of service. The bill, although not accomplishing all that should bo done, is a long step in the rignt direction; and I earnestly recommend its passage, or that of a more completely effective measure. National Guard. Now that the organized militia, the National Guard, has been incorporatiiS with tho army as a part oi the national forces, it In hooves the government to do every re.ironablo thing in its power to perfect its efficiency. It should ba assisted in its instruction and other wise aided more liberally than hereto fore. The continuous sc r vices of many well-trained rciru!ar oflrers will be essential in this connection. A bill is now pending btifora the congress creating a number of extra officers in tiie army, which if passed, as it ought to bo. will enable mora officers to be trained as instructors of. National Guard and assigned to that duty. In rase of war it will ba of th utmost importance' to have a large number of trained officers to us for turning raw levies into good troops. The Navy. I approve the recommendations of the general board for the in crease of the navy, calling especial attention to the need of addi tional destroyers and coll'ers. and above all. of tho four battleships. Tt Is desir able to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight battleships of the best existing type. I most earnestly recommend that the general board be by law turned into a general staff. There is literally no ex cuse whatever for continuing the pres ent bureau organization of the navy. The navy should be treated as a purely mili tary organization, and everything should be subordinated to the one object of se curing military efficiency. A system of promotion by merit, either by selec tion or by exclusion, or by both processes, should be introduced. It is out of the question, if the present principle of promotion by mere seniority is kept, to expect to get the best results from the higher officers. Our men conn too old. and stay for too short a time, in the high command positions. Nothing better for the navy from every standpoint has ever occurred than th cruise of tho battle ri'-et around th world. The improvement of the ships in every way has been extraordinary, and thy have gained far more experience in battle tactics than tl.ey would have gained if they had siyed in the Atlantic waters. The Ati.rian j.'ople ha-.e catists for profound gratift' ation, both in view of the excel?-!:' condition ,,r f tlttt an hcwn by il-:. '-rui-e. and in view of tiny iinproveis.eiit t'.ie cruise has worked in this already high rvaelition. I do not heiirvo that there Is any oth?r service in the world In wt.'ch the average of char acter aid ctRc.'-ncy in the enlisted rneit .3 as h'.gli a:- s i;w the case in our own.
