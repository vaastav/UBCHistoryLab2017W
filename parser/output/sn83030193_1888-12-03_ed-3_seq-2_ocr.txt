PEOPLE'S CAUSE," Oonttmud from first page. Is so apparent as to bs generally conoeded. Dnt the means by which this end shall be accom plished and the snm of direct benefit which shall result to our dtlzons present a controversy of the utmost importance. There should bo no scheme accepted is satisfactory by which tho burdens of tho people aroonly apparently re moved. Extravagant appropriations of pnblio money,wthalithcirdemorallzinir consequences, should not bn tolerated, cither as a means of re lleving the Treasury of Its present surplus or as furnfihlntr pretext for rcsintlnit a proper redaction In tafirT rates. Existing otIIs ancllii. Justlco shonld be honestly rcroKtilzcil, holtlly mot and effectively remedied. There should Ira no cessation of tlio BtrtiHBlo until a plan, In jwr fectcd, fair and consetTatlTO towards existing Industries, but which will rednco the cost to con sumers of the necessaries of life, while it pro vides for our manufacturers tho advantage of freer raw material andpermlU no injury to tho interests of American labor. IT IS TUE FKOFl,a'H CAtMK. The cause for which the battlo Is waged la comprised within lines clearly and distinctly de fined. It should never bo compromised. It is tho people's cause. It cannot bo (tailed that the selfish, and pri vate interests which aro so persistently heard, when efforts are made to deal In a lust and com prehensive manner with onr tariff laws, nro related to, If they aro not responsible for, tho Mntlment largelyprcvalllng among the people, that tho General umemniout is tho fountain of individual and privato aid; that it may be expected to relievo with patornal oaro tho distress of citizens and communities, and that from the fulness of its Treasury it should, upon the slightest possiblo pretext of promoting tho general good, apply publio funds to the benefit of localities and Individuals. Nor can it bo de nied that there Is a growing assumption that, as against the Government and in favor of privato claims and interests, the usual rules amUimita tlons of business principles and Just dealing shonld be waived. These idoas have been unhappily mnch en couraged by lcglslatlvo acquiescence, ltcllef from contracts made with tho Government Is too easily accordod in favor of the citizen ; the failure to support claims against the Govern ment by proof, la often supplied b no bettor consideration than tho wealth of tho Gov ernment and the poverty of tho claim ant; gratuities In tho form of pensions aro granted upon no other real ground than tho Iieody condition of the applicant, or for reasons ess valid: and largo sums aro expended for publio buildings and other improvements upon representations scarcely claimed to bo related to pnhllo needs and necessities. The extent to which tho consideration of such matters subordinate and poatpono action upon subjects of great publio importance, but involv ing no special, private or partisan interest, should arrest attention and lead to reforma tion.

AMERICAN VERflEIA I announce with sincere regret that Ilayti has again become tho theatre of insurrection, dis order and bloodshed. Tho titular Government of President Baloman has been forcibly over thrown and ho driven out of tho country to France, where bo has slnco died. Tho tenure of power lias boon so unstablo amid the war of faotlons that has ensned siuco tho expulsion of President Baloman that no Government constituted by tho will of the Hay tlcn people has been recognized as administer ing responsibly the affairs of that country. Onr representative has been instructed to abstain from interference between the warring factions, and a vessel of our navy has been sent to lluy tien waters to sustain our minister and for tho protection of the pert on and property of Ameri can cltlroiiB, Duo precautions have been taken to enforce our neutrality laws and prevent onr territory from becoming the boso of military supplies for either of tho warring faotlons. Under color of a blockade, of which no rea sonable notice had been given, and which doos not appear to have been efilclently maintained, a seizure of vessels under tho American flag has been reported, and. In conseqnence, measures to preveut and redress any molestation of our innocent merchantmen havo been adopted. 

LOOSE NATCBALIZATION LAWS. With the rapid increase of Immigration to our shores and the facilities of modern travel, ab use of the generous privileges afforded by our natu ralization laws call for their careful revision. The easy and unguarded manner in which cer tificates or American citizenship can now be ob tained has induced a class, unfortunately large, to avail thcmsolvcs of tho opportunity to become absolvod from allegiance to their native land nd yet by a foreign reaidonco to cscapo any Just nty and contribution of service to the country of their proposed adoption. Thus while evad ing the duties of citizenship to the United States, they mako prompt claim for its National protection and demand its intervention in their behalf. International complications of a seri ous nature arise, and the correspondence of tho State Department discloses the great number and complexity of the questions which havo been raised. OUB DELATIONS WITH OI1EAT BniTAIN. The questions between Great Britain and the United States relating to the rights of American fishermen, under treaty and international com ity. In tho territorial waters of Canada and New foundland, I regret to say are not yet satisfac torily adjusted. These manors were fully treated In my mes sage to tho Henato of Feb. UO, 1HKH, together with which a convention, conolnded under niv authority with Her Majesty's Government on the 10th of February last, for tho removal of all causes of misunderstanding, was submitted by mo for tho approval of the Senate. This treaty having been rejected by tho Sen ate I transmitted a message to tho Congress on the 23d of Augnst last, reviewing the transac tions and submitting for consideration certain recommendations for legislation concerning tho important iiucstlons involved. Afterwards, on tho liith of September, in le sponso to a resolution of the Senate, I again communicated fully all the infoimatlon In my poawHaion as to tho action of tho Government of Canada affecting the commercial relations bo tweeu tho Dominion and thu United States, in cluding tho treatment of American tlshiniM is sols in tho ports and waters of British North America. Thesu communications havo all been pub lished, and therefore opened to tho knowledge of both lion-en of UougreiH, although two weio addressed to tho Senate alone. Comment upon or repetition of their content would bo superfluous, and I am not an arc that anything has sinco occurred which shuuld bo added to the facts therein stated. Therefore, I merely repeat, as applicable to the present time, the statement which will be found in my tucx. rage to the Senate of Sept. lL'Uht, " Unit slnco March :i, 1H7. nociue has been repoited to the Department of titatu wherein complaint ha beon made of unfriendly or unlawful treatment of American fishing cko1s on tho pait of tho Canadian authorities, in which reparation was not promptly and satisfactorily obtained by tho United Ht.ites Consul-General at Halifax." Ilaviug eaoayed, in tho dUcharge of my duty, to procure by negotiation tho settlement of a long-standing canso of dixpute. and to remove a constant menace to the good rt latious of the t o countries, ami continuing to be of opinion that tho treaty of February last, which failed to re ceive the approval of the Senate, did Mipply "a tatinfactory, practical slid liual adjustment upon a hauls honorable and Jn'it to both putties of tho difficult and vexed question to which it related," and navlng suboqnently and unavailingly rec ommended other legislation to Congress which I hoped would suffice to meet the exigency cre ated by the rejection of the treaty, I now again invoke the earnest and immediate attention of the Congress to tho condition of this important question, as it now stands bcimo them and tho country, and for the settlement of which I am deeply solicitous,
