Quite a "plum" will be awarded in this Territory in a short time, to-wit: The medical directorship or guperii. tendency of the Territorial Insane Asylum at Black foot. That official will have control of all expenses at the institution, aud be the disciplinarian of the same. He muat, of course, be a physician of good standing. His salary rests entirely with the Board, but will probably not be less than 13U00 a year and board and lodging for himself and family—or a billet equal to *6000 per year. He will probably not be elected until next February or March, as the Asylum will not be ready until then, but it is such a good "plum" that a majority of the physicians in this Territory would doubtless wish to secure it. They will therefore feel grateful to the Times for mentioning the matter at this early date. AN OLD COASTER MARRIED. He Meets HU Fate in Omaha, an* Mettles There for Life, Dr. J. M. Rice recently got married in Omaha, Nebraska, the bride-elect being Mrs. Anna borel, a prominent dealer in hair goods and millinery of that city. Dr. Rice is well and favorably known in Idaho and Oregon, as he has probably done more to colonize those adjoining commonwealths than nineteen-twentieths of their citizens. Prior to 1880 he operated in Oregon, and successfully "floated" the Port land city Homestead, containing over 1000 lots, in 1881 he came to Idaho, and a year or so later agreed to go East fer the purpose of advertising Idaho and starting hitherward a farm ing colony. Being a man of infinite resource, he required but little help besides a few letters of recommenda tion, anJ in 1883 brought out several car-loads of settlers, over half of whom are here to this day, arid delighted with their change of base. I)r. Rice has finally got tired of roaming on the frontier, and conclud ed to settle in Omaha, where he will engage in the real estate business. As he knows no such word as "tail," he will doubtless succeed there, and will not be likely to coine to Wood River again, unless it be to look after some of his mining and other interests here. Idaho has therefore lost in him one of her best citizens. This will not, how ever, deter Ins many friends here from wishing himself and bride life-long happiness and prosperity. The Wiswell Mill.

The telpherage system of Ayrton and Terry, the English electricians, has for its object the conveyance of any kind of goods divisible into par cels of two hundredweight at a speed of four or five miles an hour. The motive power is electricity, which drives the carrying buckets along a cable suspended on posts. A telpher line has just been established at Glyude, in Sussex, and the system has proven a sqccess from n scientific point of view, the commercial value of such a meant of carrying light freight remaining to bo determined.

IT IS A VERY PLAIN AND UNAS* NUX1NU DOCUMENT. He Takes Decided Ground Afalmst the Continued Coinage of Silver, feat la " Solid " ea the Mormon Question —Death of a Two-Hundred Million aire. Sped a 1 to the Wood IIttbb Trait.) Omaha, December 9,1883. The President's message waa sent to Congress yesterday, but too late for your use. Inasmuch as you are most inter csted in the silver question, 1 send you the President's views on this subject first. His Excellency takes positive grounds against the continued coin age of silver, and emphatically recom mends the repeal of the Bland law. In order to defend and strengthen his position, the President states that up to the present time, notwithstand ing the most strenuous effuits of the hi-metallists, only about *50,000,000 of silver coin is in circulation, of the *215,000,000 coined—leaving *165, 000,000 atill in tho United States Treasury or in the hands of the Government officials, necessitating enormous expense in constructing and maintaining strong and large vaults for its secure keeping and prolonged deposit. Against the latter amount of silver coin there are only about *93,000,000 of outstanding silver cer tificates. Every month about *2,000,000 of coin the gold coin in the United States Treasury and sub-treasuries hss to be paid out in exchange for two million silver dollars, according to law, which are regularly added to the idle mass of silver already accumulated. If tliii ia continued long enough it will result in substituting silver for all the gold that the Government owns. It will not do to rely upon the customs receipts of the government to make good this decline of gold because the silver shut coined can easily be made a leyal-tender for all debts and dues. Public and private hoarding of gold has already begun, and when the time comes when gold shall disappear from circulation then there will he a marked and plainly apparent difference be tween the real value of silver and gold dollars and the two coins will part company. Gold will still remain the standard of value and, necessarily, our dealings with for eign countries will compel us to pro cure it, no matter at what premium over silver; the banks which will have received gold for deposits from their customers will pay them in deprecia ted silver bought with such gold— thus realizing a handsome profit, the laboring men and women, who are most defenseless of all, will find that the dollar received in wages fer their haul toil has sadly shrunk in pur chasing power. Mr. Cleveland quotes Daniel Web ster at some length to sustain his views, aud claims thr.t if the coinage of silver be continued we may reason ably expect gold and its equivalent to abandon the field of circulation to silver alone. This must, of course, produce a severe contraction of our circulating medium, instead of adding to it. He refers to the proceedings at the recent monetary conference of the powers of the Latin Union and draws the conclusion therefrom that if the vital parts of the silver coinage act re main in operation unrep ealrd in this country, we will find ourselves with out a single powerful ally or friend j ! I j „ y L. * Amntt llpd l\u #||a ; n the fin'd and be compeilea to name in tne ne a , .... .. • i__ .I • . . ! with silver in the illogical and losing . . contest we nave OU hand. Especial efforts l«ve been made by r J the Secretaries of the Treasury, to . . c •! force an amount of silver coin into circulstion; but the amounts thus put 1 out have soon returned in payment of 1 « - duties. This proves that the people, do not -lesire to keep it on hand,and that continued efforts in this direction would only result in total failure. It being evident that the present stock of silver dollars is ample to sup ply all the legitimate needs of the people and being satisfied that they can be readily obtained in the usual business ways by those who need them, while the demand for silver for use in the arts is increasing, the President recommends the suspension of the coinage of silver dollars au thorized by the law passed in Febru ary, 1878. Omaha, December 9, 3 p. m. The President's message is consid ered a very tame and commonplace document. I therefore refrain from putting you to heavy expense of a synopsis of it. In his recommendations on the Mormon question, he approves of the repressive work already done in Utah and Idaho, and states that he will gladly approve further legislative ac tion for expunging this foul blot upon our fair fame. William II. Vanderbilt died in New York City, at 2:30 o'clock yes terday afternoou, of a stroke of par alysis—the result of appoplezy. His death having been anticipated for some time, it will have very little ef fect on the stock market. Coming to Contract for Ore. Vice President Wright, of the Phil adelphia Mining and Smelting Com pany, will leave Philadelphia to-mor row for Hailey, to make ore contracts for next year's deliver)'. If he suc ceeds in making satisfactory arrange ments the company's furnaoes will run in full blast; otherwise not. Inas much as the ore output is steadily in creasing and the company's treatment of sellers has been very liberal, this year, Mr. Wright will probably have no difficulty iu renewing liia con tracts.
