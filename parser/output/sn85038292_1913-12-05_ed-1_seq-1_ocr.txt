WESTMINSTER, Ml)., FRIDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 5, 191IJ. CONGRESS APPLAUDS WILSON’SMESSAGE. OUTLINES MANY IMPORTANT MAHERS -ADDRESS ONLY 28 MINUTES LONG. Both Democrats and Republicans Are Pleased With Statesmanlike Utterances. President Wilson’s message to Con gress. which he read Tuesday after noon to the two Houses assembled In the House of Representatives, *s a model of berevlty and of diction, for , the words were short and well-chos en and the sentences terse ano un levolved. There was none of the loose magazine style of Involved sen tences and hopelessly intricate para graphs that made Mr. Roosevelt's mes sages such hard reading. No one can read Mr Wilson's message without a feeling of satisfaction at the easy comprehension and the quick grasp of bis words. j For exactly 28 minutes the Presi dent stood before the assembled Sen ate and House in the chamber of the latter find read his first annual mes sage. Applause punctuated Import ant utterances and when he had fln-' Ished there was an enthusiastic item oaslrntlon, with hand clapping and cheers. Briefly the President out lined a program for social Justice and lb general welfare of the nation, and proclaimed the aspirations of the United States for International amity and the maintenance of constitution al government In all America, With close, almost eager attention, members of the two houses listened and, time and again, the legislators themselves gave Vent to thelf en thusiasm along with the crowded gal leries. I>e#B than 3.000 words long, the message was one one of the briefest and most novel of American slate papers—a marked contrast as pro settled by Its author today to the hitherto lengthy documents averaging 20,000 words or more, droned through by n reading clerk to an inattentive Congress. Home of the more Important feat ures of the President’* message are given below. On Csscs—"Tfce United Stales will. I earnestly hope and confidently be- Ueve, give fresh proof of her sincere adherence In. the cause of Internation al friendship by ratifying the several treaties of arbitration awaiting re newal by the Senate.’’ On Mexico--"We shall not, I be lieve, lc obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting. And than, when the end conies, we shall hope to see constitutional order restored In dls tressed Mexico by the concert and energy of such of lo r leaders as pre fer the liberty of their people to their own ambitions." On the Currency 818 I take leave to beg that the whole energy and at tention of live Senate he < oncentraied upon It till the matter Is successfully disposed of. The pending currency hill does the farmers a great service The farmers and the Government will henceforth work together as rival partners In Ibis Held." On Trusts—" The Immediate service that we owe the business communi ties of the country Is to prevent pri vate monopoly more effectually than It has yet been prevented The way of action should be thrown wide open." On Election* I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary i-b-Mlonx through out the country at which the voters (of Oie several parties may choose their nominees’ for the Presidency without the Intervention of nominat ing conventions." "Parly conventions should lie re tallied only for the purpose of declar ing and accepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating the plat- I forms of the parties; and I suggest Hint these conventions should con sist not of delegates chosen for inis single purpose, hut of the nominees for Congress, the nominees for va cant seats in the Rennie of the United Stales, the Senators whose terms have not yet t losed, the national eom inlttee and the candidates for the Presidency themselves In order lhat platforms may be framed by those re sponsible to the people for carrying them Into effect." On our Possessions—"We must ad minister them for the people who live in them, and with the same sense of responsibility to them as toward our own people In our domestic affairs," On Mine*—"Our Bureau of Minos ought to lie equipped and empowered to render even more effectual service In Improving the conditions of mine labor.” I On Employers' Liability—"Wo owe ;It, In mere justice to the railway em -1 ployees, to provide for them a fair and effective employers’ liability act." On Safety—"We ought to address ourselves to the prompt alleviation of the very unsafe, unjust and burden some conditions which now surround the employment of sailor*.’’ Myers -Cooksoii.
