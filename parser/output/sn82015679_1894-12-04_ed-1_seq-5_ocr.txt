t - - 1 - THE INDIANAPOLIS JOURNAL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1894: tal stock until the date of their maturity. The certificates should be prepared by the Fovernmeni and ready to be furnished to the banks at any time by the Controller, who should keep an account of the Fame. They should conform In jtenfral appear ance to that of the currency of the bank?, and be of denominations convenient for which they are descried. They should be piKTted by the president and cashier of the bank i.sulnf them, and counterfeited by the Register or the United States Treas ury. When paid out they should be stamped across their face. giving date of issue, time due and amount, including Interest, at ma turity, and until the time of the date of their maturity the banks should be author ized to pay them out the same as the notes cf the banks in payment of their Indebted ness, and they should be receivable in pay ment of all private debts, except when the obligation Is provided payable in coin. After the certificates become due. their functions rs currency should cease, and they should then become as ordinary certificates of de posit of the banks that Issued them. The effect of such a policy would be, and at the very time most needed, and in proportion to the necessities of the occasion, an increase In the volume of the currency. A resource at such a time would render desirable aid to the banks and provide, for the time be ing, a currency that would serve the con venience of the people. The notes of the Tonka being secured by government bonds, and the certificates by the capital stock of the banks, at double the amount, the ques tion of security to the holdei of either would certainly be considered as satisfac tory. After such certificates have been re turned and paid by the banks, they should be canceled and returned to the Controller to be destroyed." 

CERTIFICATES FOR PROTECTION. "What was the effect uf the panic of 1S93 n the savings banks generally throughout the country?" The effect wts that they were compelled Xo avail themselves of the time privilege they were authorized to exercise by their charter In paying their depositors (which was from sixty days to ninety days.) If they ' had not done so, nearly every one of them would have been forced to suspend and subject to be placed In the hands of a re ceiver. If that had occurred great loss and distress would have followed. As it was. the temporary suspension being authorized by law. the banks maintained their reputa tion as solvent Institutions, and their de positors suffered no loss. So it would seem that at times when the people became panic-stricken they should be restrained in their frenzy in some manner until they have sufficient -time to gain thir better senses. I think the policy I have suggested Is certainly more feasible and better in its tendencies than the plan proposed by the Baltimore Clearing-house Association, as it would affonj essential relief at once to the banks, better serve the people, and, fur ther, have a decided tendency to abridge the duration of a money panic. During the panic of 18'J3 the banks of New York city, without exception, through a com bined action of the Clearing-house Asso ciation, without color or authority of law, issued certificates of Indebtedness to the extent of about seventy millions of dol lars to enable them to pull through the storm. There was no other alternative, ex cept pronounced suspension. The certifi cates were accepted as payment of bal ances between the banks, and to a great extent paid out to their depositors. The . people realized the condition of affairs and accepted the situation, and, the govern ment tolerated their action. Now. if the remedy as applied at the great money cen-" ter proved advantageous to the banks and the public generally, even without any au thority of law, why not prepare for such events and provide a way to meet such an emergency legally and in a manner that will serve all parts of the country?" "Do you (think there would be any formidable objection to the Issue of such long-time bonds aa you have proposed?" "I hardly think there would be. The Issue, as based on the present volume of currency. Including the gold, silver and cur rency .certificates, United States notes and national bank currency, would be about one thousand millions of dollars. The present circulation of the banks is only two hundred and two million dollars. On my plan they would be required to issue live hundred millions on a basis of 73 per cent, of the capital stock of the banks, the present capital being now about six hun dred and sixty millions of dollars; but I think the benefits to be derived from the , privileges of Issuing the certificates of in-ii.i..-t.. ... i t i i . . . i i ueuicuurs nut luuuve iimuj uuu&s IU in crease thetr capital stock and many new banks to be organized, so as to Increase the bank circulation to the full amount de sired, and in the meantime easy facilities would be afforded the government by the sale of the bonds for taking up its out standing notes and certificates. The exist ing national debt was forced upon the country under extraordinary circumstances. The proposed Issue of bonds would bear u very low rate of interest, and the amount realized therefor should b? used in liquidat ing the debt -to the extent of the bonds sold. I am not of the opinion that the present generation should fight all the bat tles, endure the hardships of heavy taxa tion, make the expensive public Improve ments and generally put the country In first class condition for future generations and millions of aliens to come here to enjoy without some consideration on their part." "Don't you think that some additional Precaution should be taken to prevent ank officers and employes from misap propriating the funds of the banks?" "Yes; I would suggest that competent bank examiners he appointed, and that, at the time of an examination of u bank a detailed statement should be furnished to the Controller on proper blanks, showing the entire assets of the bank, giving the namM of the makers, lnclorsers and ac .ceptors on each obligation due the bank, and the kind and amount of collateral therewith pledged. If ary, and at the next examination a similar statement rhould be furnished, that the ttwo may be compared to ascertain if any paper is carried which is not available to the bank. The law should provide that no director, officer or employe of a bank should be allowed to borrow money from the bank In which they re connected, either directly or Indirectly, without the unanimous consent of the mem bers Dresent at a meeting of the board of directors; and such consent should be duly entered of record." mif nr - wm Fair and Warmer In Indiana To-Daj, vrlth Variable Wind.

CLEVELAXO'S I.OXG It I PORT. ltn Financial Recommendation Con demned by Republicans, Popallsta and Some Democrats. CRITICISED BY 3IR. I3RICE WHO SAYS THE II A I jTI MORE PLAV WOULD IX JURE THE COUNTRY. 31 r. Hu vein yer Opinion of the Sok emtion Reicnrdlnir suxar Eipren- Ions of Leading Xewspnpern. WASHINGTON. Dec 3.-The comments on the President's message to-day were varied. By some members of Congress Mr. Cleveland was severely criticised. Of the Democratic members of the Senate com mittee on finance 'Messrs. Voorhees, Har ris and Vest asked to be excused from ex pressing any -opinion cm the financial views advanced by the President, and Senator Jones, of Arkansas, would only repeat what he had heretofore said, that he did not believe that any financial legislation would be possible during the present ses sion. Republican members of the commit tee were almost as disinclined to talk as their Democratic colleagues. Senator Sher man would go no further than to say the message contained nothing striking. Sen ator Allison declared it was not a -time for Republicans to take the lead. Senator Gorman, while declining to di rectly discuss the recommendations of the message, said at the short session, which was now beginning, action would depend largely upon the willingness of the Repub licans to permit anything to be done. Senator Drice said: "The Baltimore plan strikes me as a pure dream. Its adoption would certainly demoralize the finances of the country." Senator Teller said: "I cannot see that the measure offers any relief to the coun try, and It appears to me as if the Presi dent failed entirely to comprehend the fi nancial or political conditions." Senator Hoar said: "It Is a message with out vigor or courage, indicating In every sentence the President's consciousness of public disapproval. Can this be haughty Marmlon?" Senator Caffrey: "With reference to the President's recommendation on the sugar differential, I have my views, but prefer to withhold them for the present." Senator Stewart: "The financial plan in Mr. Cleveland's message, stripped of ver biage, means that the United States shall give bankers $75 for $22.50. Any bank that will deposit 122.50 of legal tender, whether greenbacks or treasury notes, will receive 575, of other government money a cun ning way of retiring greenbacks. It removes all restrictions of the banking law against .expansion and contraction by the banks to enable them and their associates to 'rig' the market." Senator Mitchell, of Oregon: "His whole financial scheme is impossible. It Is a proposition really going back to old wild cats." . Senator Blanchard: "I approve of the State bank recommendation. I am opposed to the repeal of the one-eighth and one tenth per cent, differential on sugar, for the reason that 74 per cent, of seven million pounds of sugar produced in Louisiana shares In the differential." , Senator Hansbrough: "I had heard that the President was suffering from the gout, and the message confirms it. He recom mends a decrease in the tariff, notwith standing the deficit, and makes no rec ommendation for the increase of revenue.' Senator Perkins: "I like hl3 recom mendation for an increase in the navy, but am opposed to his free ship proposition." Senator Vilas: "It is a ?ood, business" message." Senator Chandler said: "The message i3 a very common-place document." Speaker Crisp hai no opportunity to ex amine the message carefully, owing to the frequent interruptions, and was not pre pared to express an opinion until he had done so. Mr. Wilson, chairman of the ways and means committee, expressed his gratifica tion over the President's vigorous recom mendation of the free coal and iron bills sent to the Senate, and his indorsement of the recommendation for the abolition of the differential on refined sugar. x.-Speaker Reed had nothing to say with regard to the message. Mr. Burrows had no comment to make. General Catchlngs, a member of the com mittee on rules, considered the President's financial views. The scheme of making State banks banks of issue, under federal supervision for the redemption of the notes would, he thought, emancipate the banks of the interior from the great financial institutions of the money centers, especially in times of stringency, and furnish a safe and elastic currency. Mr. Bryan said he was opposed to any financial scheme which would give private individuals the power to issue money. Mr. Harter characterizes the President's banking schem? as a good long step In the right direction, . but, personally, he thought he ought to go further. The gov ernment. In his opinion, ought not to guar antee the payment of national bank notes or of any corporation. Mr. Springer said the President's devotion to routine recommendations in reference to business and the tariff suggestions were wise and timely. The business interests of the country may rest assured that there is to be a lony period of rest so far as the general tariff legislation is 'concerned. Mr. Bailey Is opposed to the government becoming a surety for the promissory notes of any business corporation, even though it be a bank. 

HAVEMYKR SATIRICAL. Hodv tAe Sugar Trast President View the MrHitK NEW YORK. Dec. 3.-President II. O. Havemyer, of the American Sugar Refining Company, this afternoon gave out the fol lowing signed statement: "If one will fairly and dispassionately consider the President's recommendation about sugar, it will become apparent that it comes down to this: The sugar company has taken action, the result of which Is to deprive temporarily of work 23,000 persons employed in the various Industries depend ent upon the refining of sugar, together with the members of their families. I recommend such action as to deprive those persons of work "permanently. If the In dustry Is languishing, the proper course is to destroy it "There are some things which can be es tablished through a demonstration. A com parison of the duty put by "the tariff bill upon various articles will show that while the maximum protection accorded to sugar is 5 per cent., other and more favorable articles receive protection up to 40 per cent, and 5") per cent Why this discrimina tion should be made against a large num ber of persons who hold the stock In the company and are employed in Its refineries it is Impossible to say. They protest against it. The answer to this protest in the Presi dent's message is that as the present pro tection is inadequate it ought to be removed altogether. 'Reasonable legislative aid requires that the sugar industry shall be treated as were other im portant industrits. If this is done, the industry need not languish, and thou sands of discharged workmen will have remunerative employment. The country has already pronounced its judgment on the mode in which the last Congress dealt wjth the interests of workln?men. The Presi dent apparently has not learned the lesson. It ought not require much time for work men to appreciate th i" the President, in a bid for personal popularity, is willing to strike a death blow at their Interests. Too Mui'h Centrnllxntlon. 

MONTGOMERY, Ala.. Dec. 3. Comment ing on the banking clause In President Cleveland's message. Governor Oates said to-night: There H a little too much cen tralization In the President's banking scheme to nlease States rights Democrats, but It would be a great Improvement on J the present banking system, and I heartily approve It. 

COMMENT OF THlt PRESS. Some of Mr. Cleveland Recommenda tions Severely Criticised. The annual message of Cleveland Is very much in earnest throughout, and those por tions wnicn express hi3 personal views oi public policy and the principles of govern ment have his usual force and directness. On the whole, it is a satisfactory docu ment, which clears up the situation amaz ingly, which will excite but little hostile criticism, and which is a creditable Ameri can state paper. Chicago Herald (Dem.) The President is nothing if not tena cious In his opinions. He still clings to the idea that coal and Iron ore should be placed upon the free list, but he gives no reasons for it. The Iresident is silent and by his silence approves the tariff on raw sugar. It strikes U3 that raw sugar is a pretty raw material, and If his logic Is good against a tariff on coal, iron ore and wool, cer tainly he ought to advocate putting sugar on the free list. Cleveland Plaindealer (Dem.) Mr. Cleveland's message would have been more useful if he had elaborated his views on the currency and referred briefly to the reports of his secretaries on other subjects Instead of stating other subjects fully and contenting himself with an indorsement of Secretary Carlisle's plan for a change In the currency. Reorganization of the cur rency is by far the most Important subject that has been urged by any President since the war. In the absence of settled knowl edge in their own minds, the great mas3 of citizens would very much, like to have at length the reasons which have induced Mr. Cleveland to give his unqualified ap proval to a reversal of the whole monetary system of the country. St. Liouis Republic (Dem.) It Is therefore the duty of every true Dem ocrat -to labor "earnestly for the enactment of the very best financial legislation that can possibly be accomplished looking to ward a perfect and complete separation of the overnment from the banking busi ness to the removal of the control of the currency out of the hands of a few national bankers, end its restoration, as near as may hi, to the people themselves. Nash ville American (Dem.) The President broadly intimates the ac tion of Germany in excluding Importations of live stock and fresh meat from this country, is due to the provisions of ur cus toms act imposing a discriminating duty of 1 cent a pound on sugars coming from countries that pay an export bounty tbere on. The President recommends a repeal of such duty In the Interest of commerce. We do not feel inclined to approve this recommendation. An export bounty paid by a foreign country operates to the dis advantage of the American producer. A discriminating duty in such cases Is not protection against fair compstiton but aganst unfair competition. Memphis Com mercial Appeal (Dem.) The President's annual message Is un usually long, and Is almost as uninterest ing as It is long. Aside from the indorse ment and synopsis of Secretary Carlisle's plan for currency reform, with one or two other recommendations, the message has little other significance than attaches to a clerk-like condensation of the various de partment reports. In this respect It Is very different from some of the preceding messages of Mr. Cleveland. The feature that will attract most attention is tne recommendation of a plan looking to the commendable object of divorcing the gov ernment from the business of banking and providing for an ample, elastic and per fectly safe bank currency. Louisville Courier-Journal (Dem.) The message Is remarkable for nothing but the President's financial recommenda tions, which are intended to please the Pop ulists and Democrats of the South and West, and which, if carried out, would re sult In a revival of wild-cat currency and the material weakening of the national banking system by decreasing the security of the billholders and leaving depositors at the mercy of dishonest bank officials. Cleveland Leader (Rep.) The Pre: '.dent. In his message, favors the abolition of "every particle of differential duty in favor of refined sugar," and the abolition of the retaliatory duty on refined Imported from countries that pay export bounties. If he had taken this stand at the close of the last session Instead of per mitting Mr. Carlisle to identify the admin istration with the Sugar Trust something might have turned out differently. There Is very little to say about the message on the whole, because it Is not a whole, but an aggregation of unrelated parts. San Fran cisco Examiner (Ind. Dem.) - ; . It Is doubtful if ihere has ever been pre sented to a Congress a more conservative and judicious address than that sent in by President Cleveland. It is free- from radi cal views and aggresslva proposals and should promote harmony In the councils of the party in these, its last' days of power for some time to come. It Is the first time Mr. Cleveland has failed to burden his mes sage with a special policy. New Orleans Picayune .(Dem.). President- Cleveland's message to Con gress 1s what might be called a tardy message. The President has been laid up for two or three weeks with gout or some ailment of that sort at his suburban resi dence, and the message bear3 traces of that compulsory Inactivity, for it is made up, in a large measure, of condensations of the Cabinet ministers reports. The message, in fact, viewed in its totality, makes the remote suggestion that its au-' thor might probably be "losing his grip." 'New Orleans Times-Democrat (Dem.) The message of President Cleveland this year Is the longest one that he has ever written, and the one that contains the least matter of original interest and Importance. It Is composed mainly of abstracts of the reports cf the different departments, with passing recommendations upon points that do not particularly affect the general wel fare. That part of the message which will attract the most attention, however, is the outline of a plan for a new currency sys tem. St. Louis Globe-Democrat (Rep.) The President's unequivocal declaration that he will maintain the national curren cy on a gold basis at any cost In bonds should dispel all doubt on that score If such doubts have still existed anywhere. The recommendation that the discriminat ing duty against German sugars be re moved, and that free coal, free iron and free ships be granted to the citizens of this country merely serve to emphasize the small figure cut by tariff arguments in this message. Chicago Record (lnd.) With the exception of the brief tariff statement and the somewhat longer finan cial statement, the message is purely cler ical and reflects the routine work of the departments. Summed up, it is a long business message without partisan exalta tion on the one hand or useless mourning over recent catastrophies on he other, and with evident suggestions of gout. Chicago Tribune (Rep.) Better, infinitely better, a special session of the Congress-elect in the spring than the overturning of our present monetary system with a return to one fundamentally me same as tne old anti-war State bank bill system. Chicago Inter-Ocean (Rep.) The President's declarations that we ought to have free coal and fre iron, and above all that the differential duty In. favor of refined sugar should be stricken off, are In entire accord, we firmly believe, with the ponular judgment. Detroit Free Pre'ss (Dem.) Mr. Cleveland acknowledges that gold Is at present the only money of financial re demption. The President meets the situ ation with great courage and great ob stinacy. He insists that he will maintain the gold reserve and keen right on sell ing bonds whenever it shall be necessary to keep the gold treasure at 

J100.GOO.000. In that he Is courageous. He is obstinate in that he ignores the real necessity of the hour, and in h!s set hostility to silver stands like a stone wall to prevent any legislation looking to the restoration of a real bi-metallic currency. Detroit Tribune (Rep.) The most interesting feature of the Pres ident's recommendation of withdrawal from the Berlin treaty Is his recognition of Con gress as having some authority concern ing our foreign relations. That the Pres ident should think it worth while to con sult Congress In this matter Is a most en couraging sign of the beneficial educational effect upon him of his experience In the Hawaiian business. Cincinnati Enquirer (Dem.) There is food for serious thought in the plans proposed, for It is very generally conceded that something must be done to stop the drain of gold. If legal tenders and treasury notes are deposited In large amounts for securing circulation the raid upon gold for redemption would cease to the amount deposited. The whole ques tion is a vast c-. and should be consid ered from a bu.ness and not a partisan standpoint. Philadelphia Inquirer (Rep.) Mr. Cleveland deals In his usual plain, straightforward and sensible manner with the various public questions which he dis cusses. His positlOii with regard to the tariff has not been changed by the result of the elections. He sounds afresh the Dem ocratic battle cry for tariff reform free coal, free !ron. free ships and for war upon the greatest of tariff begotten monop olies, the Sugar Trust. Haltimore Sun (Dem.) The President's message shows a weak ening on the tariff and is lacking in any remedial measures for the popular expres sions there for the past two years. Here tofore it was understood President Cleve land would veto a free silver bill; now It Is reasonable to infer a bill for unlimited coinage upon a basis of IS to 1 would be signed. The message will create a measure of renewed distrust and general anxiety. Cincinnati Commercial-Gazette (Rep.) 

TALES OF REFUGEES SURVIVORS OP THE MASSACRE IX ARMENIA ARniVB AT ATHENS, And Give Details of the Atrocities Committed by Turks, of Which. They "Were Eyewitnesses. FIRST ACCOUNTS TOO TMJE COXFIR3IATIOX O' THE REPORTS OP TORTL'RB AMI OUTRAGES. Tito Hundred Women in One Town Meet Death After Suffering from the Lust of Their Drutal Captors. (Copyrighted, 1694. by the Associated Press.) ATHENS, Greece, Dec. 3. The Associated Press exclusively has been able to give to the world the facts of the terrible atroci ties perpetrated upon Armenian Christians In J sla Minor, and to-day a representative of the Associated Press succeeded In ob taining additional details confirming the statements previously made. The repre sentative to-day met twenty Armenian refugees, who arrived here from Armenia after a Journey full of hardships and suf fering. Securing the services of a first class interpreter, he gathered the Armeni ans together at a convenient place, and after having relieved their pressing neces sities, the Interpreter questioned the refu gees concerning the terrible events of which they had in a number of cases been eye witnesses. This party of Armenians is the first that has escaped ; from the districts where the massacres occurred, and It Is believed that even worse remains to be told, as the horrors recorded are under stood to have lasted for a long time after this party fled. Most of the persons who told their stories to-day escaped from Moo&h, DItlls and Sassoun, taking with them what little they could carry and mak ing their way with the greatest difficulty to the Russo-Turkish frontier and going to Erivan and Etchmladzln. Several Armen ian women escaped from the villages with this party, but when near Erzeroum they died from the effects of sabre wounds in flicted upon them before their escape. For about eighteen months, the Armenian refugees say, the province of Sassoun has been surrounded by Turkish troop3, and nobody has been allowed to enter it or to leave. About four months ago the Turkish authorities learned that the inhabitants of Vartemls, a village outside the frontier of Sassoun, were sending for the neces saries of life to the village of Dalvorlg. Such communication between the two vil lages being prohibited, the Turks mas sacred nearly air the inhabitants of Var temls. This wa3 the second massacre to occur. The first took place about a year ago. One of the refugees, a man named Khadjik, states that his uncle and aunt were among, the killed, the latter being violated previous to being put to death. An Armenian priest, . named Kevont, was killed for refusing to celebrate Turkish rites in his church at Vartemis. The village contained 325 Armenian, houses before the Turks attacked it, but when the fugitives left only twenty-five houses remained standing. x. ARMENIANS TAKE REVENGE. Dalvorlg, it appears, is the largest vil lage in the province f "Sassoun, and Its in habitants, when thsy learned of the horrors perpetrated by the Turks at Vartemls, at tacked the Turks on the frontier. The Turk ish commander eventually sent twelve sol diers Into Dalvorlg to 'learn what had oc curred. The Arrnf nlansc' filled with indig nation at the atr6'citIes;c.ommi'tted by the Turks at Vartemls, attacked this detach ment of Turkish soldiers and put them all to death. When the Turkish commander heard of the death of his soldiers he de termined upon avenging it in the most bloody manner possible. A strong force of Turkish troops was sent to the village with artillery and the massacre began. Guns kept up a continuous fire upon Dalvorig until practically not one stone was left standing upon another. Selo, the Bey of Initzoun, a Kurd, wKh a detachment of Kurdish cavalry. ' went with the Turkish soldiers to the village of Semel and forcibly took the Armenian priest from his church, after disgustingly defiling' the sacred vessels and the priests hands. They then bound him on a donkey,, which -they drove a dis tance of a few yards. The soldiers then fired at the priest, and killed him and the beast he was bound to. In the same vil lage the Turkish . soldiers entered an Ar menian house and violated a woman and her daughter, the latter being fourteen years of age. From this village Selo forci bly took eight Armenian girls and sent them to his harem at Inltzoan. P"urther atrocities were committed by tha Turks at the village of Kellehuzen. Before dawn this place was surrounded by sol diers and while the Inhabitants were still asletp it was set on lire. The brutal sol diers entered the house of a man named Arakel. who was asleep with his wife, and tortured them both with red hot irons. At Kellchuzfa the soldiers killed the Ar menian priest Margos who, with twenty other inmates of the house, was burned to death, the soldiers preventing anybody from escaping from the burning dwelling. The chief of the village of Cneneg was cap tured by the soldiers and bound to his two daughters. All three were then scalded to death with boiling water. KILLED 200 WOMEN. A detachment of twenty-five regulars of the Turkish cavarly, after committing In expressible horrors at the village of Seb ghank, went to the village school and ravished the girls found there. The cavalry men then devastated the building. Ibo Bey, a notorious Kurd brigand of the village of Djibran and a colonel In the regular army, went with a detachment of Turkish troops to the Aremnian villages of Bahlou, Hatez gent and Komk and at each place they committed every crime possible to commit. After driving out the men, they collected the female children of Bahlou together, about two hundred In all, and after rav ishing them they killed them all with guns and swords. After this massacre the Turkish soldiers regaled themselves with wine and whatever else they could find In the village. The Kurdish regular troops from Kizan and Bahxan entered the Armenian villages of Alianozig and Aghteg. killed the Inhab itants and wrecked their homes. The num ber of villages devastated in this manner is said to be over thirty-two. The Ar menians fled In every possible direction, but many of them were captured by the Turkish troops before they could get away and were taken to prison. Khadjik. who was the principal spokesman of the Ar menian refugees, told the whole story in a most convincing manner. Dr. G. Thouaiain, a. well-known Arme nian, has Just received a letter written on Sept. 29. from Todoriana. a village near Erzeroum. The writer says: "How can I write of the horrors of our life for the days since the Hth? (Mounted robbers rode into this village an hour after sunset and im mediately began indiscriminate attacks upon the Armenian inhabitants. Over 290 shots were fired at the house of the Rev. Mr. Sookiss, pastor of the Protestant com munity, who was absent In Erzeroum. Three balls struck the pastor's wife in the face. She subsequently died from the ef fects of her wounds. Some poor people Trcm Khnoos, who were living in the base ment of the pastor's house, hurried up stairs when the firing was going on, and all of them were wounded. Mr. Richardson, an American missionary, came from Erze roum to attend the funeral of the pastor's wife. On Sept. 23 a band of robbers com mitted murder at Andag .and carried oft cattle. At Dody Ihey broke Into houses and plundered them of their contents." Dr. Thoumaln was formerly a professor at the American College at Marsovan, and has himself been the victim of cruel perse cution at the hands of the Turks. In 1&3 serious disturbances occurred in various parts of Armenia. Turkish injustice and op pression drove the people to r volt and the American College was held by the authori ties to be the great instigator of the trouble. The truth of the matter was mere ly that, owing to evangelistic work con ducted in Armenia, of which the college was the center, the people had aspired to a higher degree of religious and educational freedom and the uprisings of the oppressed people were made the excuse for throwing scores of innocent Christians into prison, and for closing the college and burning part of it. A number of. those arrested weTe tried at Angorla and seventeen were sen tenced to death on false and forged evi dence, among the number being Dr. Thou maln and another professor of the college. Representations were made to the Sultan by several of the powers on behalf of the condemned men and an agitation towards the same end was carried on in England. This had its effect in the pardon of Dr. Thoumain and the other professor, both of whom were sent into perpetual exile and the reprieve of ten others, who were con demned to eight years imprisonment. Five of the prisoners were, however, executed. ARMENIANS AT FAtLT. Turkish Account of the Killing of Christians by Kurds. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. The Turkish le gation to-day furnished the following offi cial telegram received by the minister from Turkey relative to the troubles In Armenia: "It has been ascertained that agitators, originally from Roumania and Greece and recruited in the Caucausus, took an import ant part in the Sasseun rebellion. Follow ing instructions from London Armenian committee, money Is even now setretly sub scribed in the Caucasus with the view of creating more troubles at Moosh and other places. It was the Armenians of the Talourle district who started the revolt, at tacking Mussulman villages, the Inhabitants of which had great difficulty in sheltering themselves in their winter quarters rlear Diarbekir. Regular troops were Imme diately sent to the spot. These troops never employed more than seventy or eighty Kurds of the Djafer tribe, who served as guides in the hilly regions, according to the customs that all armies follows. These facts show that far from committing any cruel ties, the regular troops succeeded in restor ing peace and order. A further, proof that there was no persecution of any sort Is evinced by the fact that peaceful Armenian villages, not partaking of the revolutionajy movement, although surrounded by the vil lages, the inhabitants of whidh were In open revolt, were left in perfect security and unmolested during and after the mili tary operations." The Kaiser to Naval Recruits. KlEL, Dec. 3. The naval recruit were sworn in to-day in the presence of the Em peror, who exhorted them to remain faith ful to their oath both at home and abroad. "In the dim past," his Majesty proceeded, 'when the Cimbri and the Teutone ad vanced across the Alps, the Germans used to chain them together to light against the enemy. Now, however, no such chain is needed, the oath being the bond holding all warriors together." WANTS 400 000,000 YEN AND CESSION OF THE TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY HER TROOPS. Terms on Which Japan Is "Willing lo Make Peace Xoit with China 1.1 Ilunjr Chans' Patriotism.' YOKOHAMA, Dec. 3. According to the eemi-offlcial 'press, Japan has decided to in sist on heavy conditions of ' peace, which will be increased as tne war is prolonged. If the war .was concluded at the present time Japan would accept an Indemnity of 400,000,000 yen and the cession of the terri tory now occupied by her forces. Too much weight should not be attached to the Chi nese overtures for peace, for It is believed that Japan will be requested to give her enemy further proof of the power of Japan in order that the Chinese people may !arn that their government sued for peace. If Taku and Shan Hal Kwan cannot be at tacked this winter owing to the severity of the climate the war will be carried oil in other populous parts of China. No armis tice will be granted unless China formally sues for peace aid surrenders Peking to the. Japanese or gives other pledges in pro portion to the demands of Japan. If China is unable to pay the war indemnity immedi ately, a portion of the sum decided upon paid down will be accepted and the re mainder may be paid in installments with interest. It must, however, be stipulated that the power of Japan, is regarded as ab solute, and then there will be no further opposition to the conclusion of peace. Ll Hung: ClmuB Worth 34M,000,000. ; 

TACOM A, Wash., Dec. 3.-Donald Frazler, president of the National Bank of China, located at Hong Kong, left the Orient two weeks ago and arrived here Saturday. He is accompanied by A. E. McGlew, a Kobe merchant, who is going to New York to be married. These gentlemen tell a gossipy story about the Chinese-Japanese war, and incidents growing out of and connected with it. Mr. Frazler says, for instance, of LI Hung Chang, who is considered, as a rule, a great patriot in this country, that he is worth $500,000,000. That is his ac cepted worth among financiers in China. He is no more patriotic than the rest of the corrupt Chinese officialdom. He made his money "sweating" those under Mm. He led the Emperor to believe he had a fine army, when, In fact, he had no army at all to speak of. It was understood he was out of his head three years ago, and if that Is so, he certainly is not sound now. Like other Chinamen, he is unpatriotic. They all look out for self, and have no patriotic motives whatever. DPu 

FLOWER'S TROUBLES. Rearrested on n Xew Charge Soon as He Got Oat of Chieasro'a Jail. CHICAGO, Dec. 3. Dr. R. C. Flower, of Boston, brought here yesterday from Gal veston, Tex., and lodged in jail on charges of defrauding N. C. Foster, a lumberman, of Fairfield, Wis., out of $45,000 in connec tion with a deal made with the bonds of the Demlng (N. M.) Land and Water, Com pany, secured ball this evening and was re leased from the Cook county Jail. His lib erty was of short duration, however, as about 9 o'clock he and his private secretary, H. C. Mosher, were arrested by a repre sentative of the Mooney & Boland agency. This second arrest was made at the in stance of William Chapman, of Peoria, III. It seems that Mr. Chapman was the owner of a large amount of valuable property In the coal belt of Illinois, which for a num ber of years was managed by his eon-in-law. A couple of years ago the son-in-law died. Soon after, according to Mr. Chap man's story. Dr. Flower appeared on the scene, and after a time induced Mr. Chap man to allow him to form new stock corporation, taking most . of the Chapman property, Mr. Chapman to retain control and be secured. According to the story told to-night the deal was consummated by Dr. Flower, but up to this time Mr. Chap man has not been secured in any way. and has, therefore, sworn out warrants charg ing Flower with larceny by embezzlement. The Doctor and his private secretary were taken before a Justice, and up to a late hour to-night had not secured ball on this new charge. FATAL RAILWAY WRECKS.

The Spectator, in paying a visit to an old college friend, one of the editorial staff of a leading New York magazine chanced to come upon him when he was at his busiest. On his desk lay a pile of proof sllps, which. It was explained, . were the "revised" proofs that Is. proofs In which typographical errors and variations from copy had been corrected of a forthcom ing story by a celebrated author. Yet, al though the proof-reader had done his work. as the quick eye and answering hand of the Spectator's friend traveled quickly down a. long Blip, a series of queries, sug gestions and substitutions marked the ex tent of further thorough revision. Prompted by curiosity, the Spectator asked to look at one of these re-revlsed slips. The errors were many of them simply careless, show ing slipshod work, such as "that" for "but tha.;" "had been originally" where "orig inally had been" was much bet ter: "reclaimed for sober lives" instead of "reclaimed to sober lives." But the re-revlslon was not confined to mere minor amendments of style, or to obvious corrections. All doubtful state ments of facts were challenged, as, for In stance, the population of Constantinople as given. Any doubtful phrase, which sounded well but would not bear examina tion, was also queried; for instance, the phrase "darksome desert" The Spectator's friend had. close at hand all the tools for quick as well as accurate revision a pile of ready-reference handbooks to save him from the necessity of consulting a big en cyclopedia. And what "a walking ency clopedia" he himself had to be to detect at a glance a possible error of fnc to say nothing of faults of style; and what a won der of constant alertness as well. But the work of revision does not stop with the Spectator's friend. The proof-slips have still to be submitted to his superior e"or, who passes upon the corrections, su..?s tions and substitutions noted, and adds any of his own as they occur to him. It is a wise author, thought the Spectator, who will recognize his own production after It has run the gauntlet of that office. The Spectator expressed the hope that authors Improved as the result of such lessons in thoroughgoing revision. The Spectator's friend declared that the reverse of this was the case; that authors retro graded steadily in exact proportion to their success In securing publication for their articles and stories in. this magazine. They were encouraged in habits of laziness, knowing that they could rely on editorial revision to save thm from the results of slipshod work. "In short," said the Spec tator's friend, "our system may be called one for the discouragement of literary per fection among authors." It is. of course, refreshing to find anywhere in this prac tical world evidence of such excessive pains to maintain an ileal standard. But the old American question, Does it pay? would force itself upon the Spectator's mind. It recalled to him something that a writer of general editorials . for the Naw York Sun once said to him. This man was not a regular member of the staff, but sent in contributions from wherever he hap pened to be. His remark was this: "Mr. Dana always reads over all editorial proof i before any editorial appears. If, after I have mailed an editorial, some word comes to me which would better express my meaning In a particular place than the one I chose, that word is sure to be substituted when ' the editorial appears. Mr. Dana is the most remarkable example of a perfect reviser that I have ever rnown. I do not believe a better Is possible " GreKhum and the Jupanewe. Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. In view of the disgraceful performance of Secretary Gresham every true American will recall with pleasure the noble action of Minister Patrick Egan at Santiago in nrotectinsr refugees at the American lega tion. He was acting under an administra tion that was actuated by the American spirit. When that administration went out of power In March. 1833, the cold-blooded and un-American Gresham ordered Minister Egan -to surrender the men ne had pro tected. The minister, deeply humiliated. did not surrender them, but told them to make their, escape, as he could no longer protect them. We believe that one or two saved themselves, while at least one fell a victim to the barbarous order from Wash ington. All honor to Patrick Kgan and the administration of Benjamin Harrison. The people of this country have no higher duty than to restore Americanism in the State Department and reassert the precedents of the Republic that have been so wantonly and barbarously trampled upon; Tito llunkn Cloned.
