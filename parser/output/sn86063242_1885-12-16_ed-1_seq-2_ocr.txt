TARIFF he says The fact that our revenues are jn excess of the actual needs of an eco noesjcgl administration of the Govern nent justices a reduction in the amount received from the people for its support iOur Government is but the means estab jlkhed by the will of a free people by which certain principles are applied which they have adopted for their benefit ind protection and it is never better ad ministered its true spirit never better observed than when the peopled taxa tion for its support is scrupulously limit jed to tke actual neeessitv of expenditure and distributed according to a just and -equitable plan The proposition with which we Have to deal is a reduction of tke revenue received by the Government and indirectly paid by the people from customs duties The question of free trade is not involved nor is there now any occasion for a general discussion of the wisdom or expediency of a protective system Justice and fairnes dictat sthat in any modification of out present laws relating to revenue the industries and interests which have been encouraged by such laws and in which our citizens have Jarge investments should not be injured CT ruthlessly destroyed Wehould also deal wijh the subject in such a manner as to protect the interest of American labor which is the capital of our work ingmen its stability and proper remu neration furnish the most justifiable pre text for a protective policy Within these limitations a certain reduction should be made in our customs revenue The amount of such reductions having been determined and inquiry follows as to where it can be remitted and which articles can best be released from duty in tke interest of our citizens I think a reduction should be made in the revenue derived from a tax upon the imported necessaries of life We thus directly les sen tke cost of living in every family of the land and release to the people in ev ery husable home a larger measure of the rewards of frugal industry THE 

CJJRREXCY PROBLEM Nothing more important he says than the present condition of our currency and coinage can claim the attention of Con gress The very limited amount of cir culating 2 Tational bank notes compared with the amount the law permits them a issue indicates that the volume of our circulating medium -may be largely in creased through this instrumentality On tke silver question he takes strong reua4sin favor of the suspension of the cfiimayc uf mlyer dollars The authority coi mosey giren to Congress by the CwsCTtutioo if ft permits purchase of kulliau er coinage is any event does not 7 HP to a extent beyond the aasout seeded for a aaMdent circalating edia The desire to utilize tbe silver product of the country should not lead to a misuse or perversion of this power Tke aecessity for suck an addition to ail r cnrrescY as is coiBpaliecl by tke i vsr coinage act he savs is negatired by tke fact tkat ud to tke nrssent tie onlr stout 500060 of tke 210Q000 wlver dollars oiaed siace 1878 kare found their way into circulation leaving more tbaa 165000000 ia the possession of the Governaaeut the custody of which has eatailed considerable expense for the coBstmction of vaults for its deposit Against this latter amount there are out standing silver certificates amounting to about y3000000 Every snonth 2000 000 of eold ia the public treasury is paid out for two milliou orssore of silver accumulated If continued long enough this operation will result in the substitu tion of silver for all the gold the Gov ernment emu applicable to its general purposes It will not do to rely upon the customs receipts of the Government to make good this drain of gold because of the silver thus coined having been made a legal tender for all debts and dues public and private At times du ring the last six months 58 per cent of the receipts for duties have been in silver or silver certificates while the average within that period has been 20 per cent The proportion of silver and its certifi cates received by the Government will probably in crease as time goes on for the reason that the nearer the period reaches when it will be obliged to offer silver m payment of its obligation the greater in ducement there will be to hoard gold against the depreciation in the ralue of silver or for the purpose of speculating This hoarding of gold has already be gun When the time comes that gold has been withdrawn from circulation there will be an apparent difference be tween the real value of a silver dollar and a dollar in gold and the two coins will part company Gold still the stand ard of value and necessary in our deal ings with other countries will be at a over silver the banks which Eremium ave substituted gold for the deposits of their customers may pay them with sil ver bought with such gold thus making a hansbme profit Bich speculators will sell their hoarded gold to their neigh bors who need it to liquidate their for eign debts at a runinous premium over silver and the laboring men and women the most defenseless will find that the dollar received for the wage of their toil has sadly shrunk in ita purchasing power It may be said that the latter result will be but temporary and that ultimate Iy the price of labor will be adjusted to tne change but even if this takes place the wage worker can not possibly gain but must inevitably lose since the price he is compelled to pay for a living will not only be measured in coin heavily depreciated and fluctuating and uncer tain in its value but this uncertainty in the value of the purchasing medium will be made a pretext for an advance in prices beyond that justified by the act ual depreciation Those who do not fear the disastrous consequences arising from the continued compulsory coinage of silver and who suppose that the addition to the currency intended as ita result will be a public benefaction are reminded by the Presi dent that kistory demonstrates that the point is easily reached in the attempt to float at the same time two series of mon ey of different excellence when the bet ter will cease to be in general circulation So if silver coinage be continued we may reasonably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon the field of cir culation to silver alone and this muBt produce a severe contraction of currency instead of adding to it The fact that after special efforts by the Secretary of the Treasury in payment of duties leads to the belief that the people do not now desire to keep it on hand and this with the evident disposition to hoard gold gives rise to the suspicion that there al ready exists a lack of confidence among the people touching our financiel process es There is certainly not enough silver now in circulation to cause uneasiness and the whole amount coined and now on hand might after a time be absorbed by the people without apprehension but it is the ceasless stream that threatens to overflow tke land which causes fear and uncertainty Leaving the considerations of a home nature in the discussion of this subject the President says the line of action in regard to -our currency can not be wisely settled or persisted in with out considering the attitudeon the sub ject of other countries with whom we maintain commercial relations The at1 titnde of foreign powers remain substan tially unchanged since the monetary con ference of 1881 and the steps already taken to secure the adoption of a com mon international ratio between gold and silver demonstrate the uselessness of further attempts at present to arrive at any agreement on the subject with other nations In the meantime we are accu mulating silver coin based on our own peculiar ratio to such an extent as will render us an undesirable party to any fu ture monetary conference of the nations Be turning to the discussion of the ques tion at home the President says we have now on hand all the silver necessary to supply the present needs of the people and to satisfy those who from sentiment wish to see them in circulation If their coinage is suspended they can be readily obtained by all who desire them If the need of more is at any time apparent the coinage can be renewed Look Hebe Bead this please We have carried slow customers until we are loaded down and it is impossible to con tinue to credit those whose notes and ac counts are past due We must have pay from you and will take live stock at its valueon notes and accounts Do not call for credit even if you are good if you are owing us and have not settled We mean what we say J T F Day The Coantxy 2wpKer and It Pay Louisville Commercial The editors of the country press are an ill paid class considering tne value of their work to the State Their work is less easily measured than that of or dinary dayrlaborers hence they are often paid less A copy of a county paper paid for by one subscriber may go through the hands of a dozen other per sons all of whom may be benefited with out compensating the publisher If only one man in a dozen who ate bread from a bakery paid the baker for his loaf the bread making business woujd soon de cline The newspaper as in exchange of local news of real importance to say nothing of the personal gossip which is equally interesting to most readers has a substantial value It saves time for those who otherwise would be obliged to gather by personal efforts the facts con tained in tne paper it saves some per sons from pecuniary loss by keeping them informed in cases where ignorance of current or approaching events would be injurious to business The just basis of compensation for the newspaper man if it were possible would be to compute tke actual value of the information pub lished dividing this by tke number of persoas to be benefited to get the amount of the anneal subscription every one should pay A more practicable method might be to estimate the cost of collecting and printing the local news of a town aud county the amount wkk tkeadilss salary added to be assessd4 Upon tna so Dscn Dera oince no reaacr is liatisfied to accept a poor paper for the reason tkat the price paid is small it is een that the price ana the value of a newspaper do not always correspond as nearly as with articles of food or apparel The local editor is expected to furnish all the news in his county regardless of the cost for the very small sum which the average reader of today insists is enough for the price of the paper Yet the same average reader does not go to hk barer or butcher tender a small sum lars to be added to the idle mass already of money and demand for it enough food for his family regardless of the first cost of that food The price of the county newspaper is generally too small and the publisher as a rule is unable to increase it The mistake many people make is in demanding their county paper for the low price charged by the city weekly papers It snouid be unaerxtooa mat as the circulation of a newspaper increases the price may be lessened If a Louis ville weekly publishes aa many thou sands of copies as a Princeton paper pub lishes hundreds it is impossible that the latter shoud be both as good and as cheap But the two papers belong to two classes The people of Caldwell county few in number need anewspaper printed near their homes to furnish them every week certain information which can not be gven by the outside press The Louisville psper gives a more gen eral class of information suited equally well to every county in the State and to some other States Neither paper can fill the place of the other and the price of one should not be made the basis of that of the other A man can not buy as large a bulk of tea for a dollar as of wheat It would be as reasonable for him to demand this as to ask that his country publisher give him as many columns of print for a dollar as a city publisher does The Kentucky news- apers on an average are not excelled E y the country press of any other State but the editors are doing too much for the money they get Their papers ought to be smaller or their prices higher and arguments such as are given here ought to be instilled into the public mind un til editing local
