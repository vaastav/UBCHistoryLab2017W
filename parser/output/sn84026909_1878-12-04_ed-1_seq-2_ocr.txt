Governor's Annual Message. -7STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, EXECUTIVE CHAMBER, CoLUMBTA, November 26, 1878. Gentlemen of the General Assembly: The painful accident which hap pened to Governor Hampton en Thurs day, the 7th instant, and which sent. deep sorrow and gloom to every house hold in the State, having disabled him physically from the performance of his high duties as Governor of the State of South Carolina, with that ex. ated patriotism and self-sacrificing de votion to the best interest of theState which has characterized him through -ife, as soon as he became aware of the -full extent of his injuries he at once elieved himself by proclamation of -hthe powers and duties of said office, and, under the provisions of the Con stitution, the same devolved upon me This took place on the 13th instant. and-on-the same day I took charge .!-tt9he Executive Department. Un'der -these circumstances, it has become my duty to address you at this your an nual meeting. This unfortunate ca Jamity to Governor Hampton was so unexpected and the time has been so short since I assumed the discharge of the duties appertaining to this o e, and the pressure of the current business has been so heavy, that I have been unable, up to this time, to inform n-- yself fully of the wants and necessi e' of our people so as to make such l and matured recommendations audsuggestions to your honorable as the condition of the Statr - -may perhaps require, and as, no doubt, --Governor Hampton, had he been spar sedthis misfortune, would have been iipared to make. 7.The reports, however, of the very efficient offi3ers in the different de rtments and boards connected with ti administration, which will be laid yon your tables at an early day, are o full ani thorough, so abundant in fmnation and so replete wit h valu Ab1esuggestions covering the special ubject matters to which they sever ly refer, and these matters embrac Fng as they do almost the entire field ofkgislation, I feel greatly relieved hereby ani- shall content myself on his occasion with calling the atten of the General Assembly especial F.10 -the valuable contents of these rdports, with such recommendations tiereon as within the limited time rhiih.has been allowed me I have ~enenabled to conclude would be wise ~j ndproper. - 

FINANCE. 'The annual report of the Comp s ~ller General, to be submitted to Syou with the other department re ~orts by the 1st of iDecember, will contain an elaborate and carefully-pre 2ared statement of the errors and in uraies in the books of his offiee ~ndof thei Treasurer's office, as turned Soeeytothe present incumbents by their -redecessors, and also a report upon thie value of numerous accounts which -camber thle books and reader decep tve tbb balance sheet which he is by $.-1awrequired to lay before your hon orable bodies as exhibiting a true and ~acorate account of the actual state of ~ he Treasury. I beg to commend this -eport to your consideration. B esides the usual statistics relating t~ o taxes and the financies, his report Swllalso be found to contain some -~getons upon these matters, and other subjects relating to his depart 'iient, which I regard as valuable, be K in based upon the experience and ibservation of the last two years or a eist careful and competent public -ofca. - The importance of the sub ~ ecs dealt with in this report, and the fact that any discussion of them. -'to be of value, must go into elaborate 'S etails and statistics, induces me to 6 efrain from further allusion to them - ,at this time, as the report. itself will bea found to be full, clear and ac curate. There is one matter, however, which ~s brought out in the report to which I esire to call your attention espec ia4.There are some evils connected ith the organization of what is u2kown as the Board of Equalization -hieh eminently deserve considera ion. In the report of the Comip > troller will be found suggestions in tended to remedy these exils. It eer ~'tainly is just that every citizen in the State should be required to aid the ~ernment in the shape of taxation Sto the extent of the value of his prop erty protected thereby. The burden of taxation, however, should bear equally on all, and it is to be hoped that in your wisdom, some measure maay- be adopted to improve the pres ~'ent system of assessment and be promo tive of the great end of equality, so mnuch to be desired. If this is done, no eitizen would have the right to complain, nor would they complain, for I feel sure that all of our people ~re willing to bear their proper share 6fihe burden of necessary taxation ; aut in the absence of this, complaints wi not only be numerous but well founded. The object of the Board of "'Equalization is to produce this equal ity, and to this end the manner in which the Board is to be organized is a matter of the highest importance. 

EDUCATION. The report of the State Sup3rin tendent of Education gives an en ~couraging account of the condition of the-public schools. The last General Assembly made -important changes in the school law. wvhich is now better adapted to the wants of our people. The report shows 11G,239 children attended the public schools last year, an increase of nearly 14,000 over the numiber reported for the preceding year. This fact, together with the in ereased interest in education mani S-fested by all classes of our citizens an h npoements in our public sceure more prompt payment of the teachers' salaries. During the past year much embarrassment and loss to teachers resulted in the delay in the collection of taxes. Unless some remedy for this evil is provided, it is feared that we will lose the services of some of our best teachers. The other recommendations con tained in the report are well worthy of your careful consideration. The last General Assembly prepar ed a memorial to be presented to Congress asking the restoration to the State of the property in Charleston known as the Citadel Academy. I am not informed as to what actiou, if any, was taken by Congress in this matter. This valauble property, which belongs to the State, has been held since the war by the Federal govern ment and*used as a garrison for troops. The re establishment of the Military Academy is a measure of -great im portauce to our educational interests. The early opening of the State University is, in my judgement, of the greatest importance. The Con stitution of the State, Article X; Section 9, makes it the duty of the General Assembly to provide for the maintenance of this institution. The faithful discharge of the duty thus imposed, is rendered more binding by considerations of the highest policy. There can be no doubt that the unity of our people in the past and the com manding position which for so many years South Carolina held in the counsels of 91e nation was due in some measure to the influence of the college. Nothing will contribute more to the material prosperity of the State than the restoration of this in stitution to its former condition ol usefulness. I do not underestimate the denomi national colleges which now exist in this State. They are contributing largely to the education of our peo ple, and they-well deserve the patron age which they receive, and more. Bui iu order to complete our educationa fabric, we should have a State insti tution not only worthy of the past, but fitted for the increased wants of th future. This matter, however, is sole. ly for you. You are better informed of the wants and wishes of the peo ple and their necessities, financial and otherwise, than myself; and with vot to whom this subject properly belongs I respectfully leave it. MILITIA. The general condition of this branel of the public service shows great im provement, as will be seen from th< full exhibit in the report of the Ad jutant and Inspector General. Man: nominal organizations of the Nationa Guard, which, on inspection, had failed to meet the requirements o law. have been disbanded, but al effective bodies have been retained and the State Volunteers have rapid; increased in numbers and efficiency and their condition is highly credita table to their officeers and the people The supply of arms and equipments however, is totally inadequate. Man~ of the commands are entirely withou outfit of any kin's, and, though severa artillery companies have been organ ized, yet the State does not own a sin gle piecc of ordnance. The usual source from which sup plies have been drawn is the genera government. By Act of Congress the sum of two hundred thousand dol la-s is annually appropriated for arm ine- the militia of the States, and efforts are now being made in some o: the Northern States to have this sua increased to one million per annum Under the present law, the quota foi this State is the sum of $3,358.50 due on the 30th of June of each year Under the proposed increase, Soutl Carolina would be entitled to aboul 1,000 annually. Tbis sum would be adequate to the wants of the de partment, and would soon place it or a first class footing. There exists, however, serious diffi culty in tbe way of obtaining the rdinance stores needed from the gen eral government. In the year 1809 Gov. R.K. Seog,being authorized t from the United States, actually dreni ten thousand stands of obsolete muzzk loading muskets with equipments The government claimed to regard thi issue as having been drawn in advanc of the whole quota of the years there after, and now declines to issue an~ ordinance stores to South Carolina Under the third section of the Act o: March the 3d, 1875, this State ha~ also been charged' with all its quotas during the period of the war, althougt six years before this Act the larg drafts above re,ferred to had been made It is believed that Congress will re adjust this account whenever the fact~ can be made known, and it is earnest lv desired that the matter should be brought to the attention of our menm bers in Congress by such action as your wisdom may dictate. Until this matter is settled, the troops must re. main unequipped to a great extent, as the financial condition of the State al this time will not justify the expendi ture of the large sum necessary tc purchase the arms and accoutrements needed. Some legislation, however, will be needed to perfect the system and I respectfully recommend to youi consideration the report of the Adju tant and Inspector General as embody ing the immediate wants of this de partment. 

ENAL AND) CHARITABLE INSTITU TION. The reports of the officers of the pnal and charitable institutions will give you all necessary information as to the condition and wants of these institutions. I have had an opportu nity recently of visiting the Lunatic Asyum, and I must congratulate the State in having a Board of Regents who are most zealously devoting much sent in at an early period, and I invite your careful attentiou to its contents, and, if our burdened Treasury cau p.siibly bear it. spare something to th.. humane objects suggested for the benefit of this stricket ponrtio of our people. COURT OF CLAINIS. I have been informed by the lon. J. C. Coit, Judge of the Court of Claims, that, in the discharge of his dutie,s, it became necessary to have counsel to represent the State, and that Mr. John R. Abney, Solicitor of the Fifth Circuit. rendered profe-sio. al service to the Court at such times as he could spare cousistently with his duty upon the Circuit. The Act or ganizing this Court authorized the Coiunssioner, in cases of doubt or. diffliculty, to call iu the aid of the Solicitor of the County, but no pro vision was made for his compeiisa tion. I respectfully recommend this iatter to your consideration, both as to compensation for past services and also as to the propriety of fixing a sum for the future if counsel should be needed. TIE PALMETTO 'MONUMENT. Permit me also to call your atten tion to the condition of the beautiful monument which stands on the Capi tol grounds to the famous Paluietto Regiment of South Carolina, which, by its gallantry on a foreign field. re flected so much honor upon its State during the Mexican war. Two pan els, containing the names of many of the officers and soldiers have been lost. They could be restored at trifling cost and thus the monument preserved, as it was intended, an ever existing memento of that gallant band of Carolinians. MATERIAL I)EVELOPMENT. I hope, gentlemen, that the period is now rapidly approaching when the people of this State can give less time and attention to political affairs and devote themselves to the material development of the State. I do not mean to imply that they should aban don all interest in those public mat ters usually understood as political. On the contrary, every good citizen should take a deep interest in such issues. The character of the government Wider which a people live exerts a more powerful influence upon their destiny than all other agencies com bined, and that character almost en tirely depends upon the character of the governmental officials. That gov ernment is best which is best ad ministered, and the highest and surest guaranty to this end is capacity and integrity Cu the part of those to whom Sthe different departments are en trusted. Under our system, this depends on the wanner in which the elective fran chise is exercised, not by a few but by the whole people; heuce, it follows that every good citizen should take active part and exert all his influence towards the accomplishment of that great end-good government-which in itself is the beginning and founda tion of all progress and prosperity. But good government has now been accomplished in South Caroliua. Home rule has been rescued from the hands of those political brigands who ma rauded the State for so long a time, and I hope that it has been made per manent ; if not, it certainly can be made so by the continued observance of those great and wise principles of justice and e-qual protection, to all which has so eminently distinguished the present administration and whieb so fully meets the approbation of the great heart of the people. Such be ing the fact, it is time to begin mate rial reuperation in earnest. After good government, in this lies the strength, greatness and power of a people. All history teaches the fact that there are three grand departments of human industry,-agriculture, com merce and manufactures,-which are the corner stones of human progress. The temple of earthly prosperity rests upon them, and that people is most fortunate who have been blessed by a kind Providence with material for their full development. Now this is precisely the condition of this State : Small in extent, limited in territory, yet it is full and abounding to a re mnarkabl e degree with all the material elements necessary to the development of these main industries of life. No part of the globe is blessed with a more fertile soil or genial climate; no portion of the Atlantic coast is marked with better harbors ; nor can cheaper roads be built elsewhere ; and where can there be found better facilities for the building up of all kinds of profita ble manufactories, both great and small, than here ? When you look at the State and see it thus so full of such important natural resources, it would seem that Providence had in tended that a great and happy people should dwell within its borders It should be our aim not to defeat this beneficent end of Provideace, either by suffering misrule on the part of the government or by sloth and inaction on the part of the citizens in failing to make use of the advantages by which they are surrounded. And I would earnestly recommend to the General Assembly to take this matter under consideration and see how far legisla tion can aid in the building up of these industries. I have no special scheme to rceowmen'd, but I have thought it would not be out of place to suggest the great ends to be ac complishied, leaving the means to your better judgment and superior infor mation and wisdom. II will, however, venture to sugg-est, in reference to agriculture, onte mecas ure which, in my judgment, is greatly needed, at least in much the larger porton of the up country. I refer to what is usually known as the stock mw* ~ -- i~ proves the stock, more effectuolly t protects growing crops, brings thou I sand of acres of good land under cultivation, and, what is of great importance in some sections of the I State, would preserve the timber and forest of the country, and it adds in every way to the end of all investments and labor, viz., profit. In some Counties in the State it has been adopted by a vote of the people, under i a previous law enacted by the General Assembly. With great deference I would say that this mode of legislation is an innovation of doubtful policy upon the established manner of enact ing laws; and, elections upon local qustious generally produces discord and strife and split communities into parties, which has a tendency to in volve other and perhaps more important matters, to the general prejudice of the country. In this connection, let me say that I have nuderstood that during the past two years there have been 600 able-bodied men constantly on the list of Penitentiary convicts, besides others in the County jails. This is a great mine of useful labor comparatively lost to the State. All this labor should be utilized in the development of our resources. We have rivers that need deepening, canals that ought to be dug, mines explored, railroads built. The beautiful stream that flows by the capital now useless and wasted on ac count of a few trifling obstructions across its bed near the city, might be made s vital artery, high above this point, to the internal commerce of the State: the old Santee Canal opened; those immense phosphatic deposits which lie imbedded in the rivers of the lower country fully explored and developed, and many other important enterprises consummated by a sys tematic employment, through a series of years, of the labor supplied from this source. If wen will commit crime, what better atonement to the public for their vicious conduct than to be made useful in the development of those matters in which the whole people are interested. The forfeiture and sequestration, so to speak, of their labor to the public good, it seems to me, would be a more sensible, humane and effective punishment to them than the immuring of their bodies in cells and dungeons, and at the same time would afford some com pensation for the evils which they have committed. I do not know how far legislation already had may accomplish results in the direction indicated, but I would recommend the whole subject to your careful consideration. If we intend to become a great, strong and prosperous State, the mud sills of our building must be made ofI material developmen t. Comnmence with that, and all the other elements of srengt vesnd greatness will come of The lien law expires by its own limitation on the 1st of January next. This law seems to have been well ma tured at the last session. It protects the interests of the landlord, opens a wsy for the poor man who has nothing but his health and muscles upon which to obtain credit to make these available, and it cheapens the arrange ment of recording and filing, and I think it would promote the welfare of the people to have it re-enacted. CONCLUSION In conclusion, gentlemen, permit me to congratulate the General Assembly and the whole State upon the peace and good order which has mark~ the conduct of our people during the past year, and especially during the excit ing circumstances of the political campaign through which we have just passed. Since the late war we have constantly claimed that if the State could but be placed back under the control of those to whom it rightfully belonged, on account of their superior qualifications of integrity, competeney and interest, free from foreign inter ference and domestic incompetency and misrule, that the violence and turbulence thereby engendered, and which were fast becoming chronic features in her history, would instantly disappear and that peace and good order would immediately reassert them selves. In 1876 this revolution was accomplished, and the late campaign during the present administration fully vindicates the justice and truthfulness of our claim in that event, and should silence forever the libels and slanders to which the character of the citizens of the State has been so long, so unjustly and so shamefully subjected. We as a people are enti tled to rejoice at our redemption from governmental misrule and its consL quences, and I feel sure that good men everywhere, when they come to under stand the situation, will join with us in our rejoicing, and will sympathize with us in our struggle for the per manency of that redemption. Let me express the hope that nothing will occur in the future to ma~r this recordi and that our people throughout the| State will unite together 'n the pre servation of the public peace and the continued supremacy of the law. I have purposely refrained from discussing any matters connected with the Federal government, for several reasons ; among the most prominent is the fact that, while the State and Federal governments are closely con. nected with each other, and while the happiness of the people of this State is much dependent upon both, yet the orbits of these two governments are entirely separate and distinct, anid the harmony of their movements can be best preserved by each confining itself to the discharge of its own functious1 as diined and limited in the Constitu tions of this State and of the United States. This was certainly the intention of the founders of our system, and could ~ l-.,~ ~ ii-~rriPrl rnit~ hnrrt~ r:iJ~ I >right future to the people of this state. In closing this communication, per. nit me, gentlemen, to invoke the >essings of Almighty God upon your ieliberativis. May He give you wis tAom from on high, and may the per orance of your arduous and respon iii- : duties be marked with that har n.1y which so eminently distinguished ,he General Assemblies of the olden past in South Carolina, reflecting [onor upon yourselves and lasting 1 biefits upon your people and State.

The Herald is in the highest respect a Fam ily Newspaper, devoted to the material in terests of the people of this County and the State. It circulates extensively, and as an Advertising medium offers unrivalled ad vantages. For Terms, see first page. Patterson's Successor. Iho Shall He Be? The two names most prominent before. the Legislature as candid ates for the United States Senator ship are those of Gov. Hampton and Gen. Gary. We have nothing to say against Gen. Gary; indeed we admire his brilliant war record, and appreciate at their true value the great services he has ren dered the party and the State in the more recent past. But it is no derogation to him to say that he would stand no chance in a free and untrammeled race with Gov. Hamp ton-no man would. Hampton is beyond comparison; he towers far above every other man in the State in the love and admiration of the people. In this matter of the Sen atorship, however, efforts are being made, not by Gen. Gary, but by some of his frie-ids, to trammel Gov. Hampton with side issues. They maintain that he is impera tively needed at home. They even go further than that, and say that his acceptance of the Senatorship, thereby resigning the Executive oficee, would be to desert his pott; to use his present position as a stepping-stone-that he can accom plish more good as Governor than any other man can, and that he has been elected on that account. That hc is the most suitable man for Governor ; but, at the same time, insist that he is also and in a high er degree the most suitable man for Senator. The State is safe now. With every County but one in the State democratic ; with peace and tranquility pervading every section, what is there to fear ? Whatever else remains to be done in the mat ter of reform and retrenchment must be done by the General As sembly. The democratic party is safe in power in this State. We need now to turn our attention to national politics. It is in the na tional councils that the highest tal ents and the broadest statesman ship are needed. No man can more fitly nor more ably represent South Carolina and the whole South there than Wade Hampton. The people want to see him there, both for his own sake and their own. Having borne the heavy burdens and the light compensation of the Guberna torial office one term, having so .pa triotically and so nobly borne great sacrifices for them, they desire to see the State recompense him by bestowing upon him the highest honor within its gift. To this feel ing of gratitude there is added the almost universal conviction that Hampton is the man for the place ; that, as Gen. Conner says, the best interests of the State require the presence of Gov. Hampton in thie United States Senate. Gov. Hampton's condition. Friday there was a change fQr the worse in Gov. Hampton's condition. Dr. Kinlock, of Charleston, and Dr. Campbell, of Augusta, were tele graphed for, and came. After con ultation with the other physicians in attendance they concluded that imputation is not now necessary and express the hope of saving his Leg and of his ultimate recovery. The Legislature starts off well. With earnest work and not too uch oratorical spouting they can soon wind up all the business before bem.

VEGE TINE Will Cure Rheumatism. MR. ALBERT CROOKER* the well-known druggist and apothecary, of Springvale, Me., always advises every one troubled with Rheu matism to try VEGETINE. Read His Statement: SPRINGVALE, ME., Oct. 12,1878. MR. H. R. STEVENS: Dear Sir-Fifteen years ago last fall I was taken sick with rheumatism, was unable to move until the next April. From that time until three years ago this fall I suffered ev erything with Rheumatism. Sometimes there would be weeks at a time that I could not step one step; these attacks were quite often. I suffered everything that a man could. Over three years ago last spring I cmmenced taking VEGETINE and followed It up until I had taken seven botles; bave had no rheumatism since that time. 1 al ways advise every one that is troubled with rheumatism to try VEGETINE, and not suffer for years as I hav,e done. This statement is gratuitous as far as Mr. Stevens is concerned. Yours, etc., ALBERT CROCKER, Firm of A. Crocker & Co., Druggists and Apothecaries. VEGETINE Has Entirely Cured Me. BOSTON, Oct., 1870. ME. H. R. STETENS: Dear Sir-My daughter, after having a se vere attack of Whooping Cough, was left in a feebie state of healtb. Being advised by a friend she tried the VEGETINE, and after using a few bottles was fully restored to health. I have been a great sufferer from Rheuma tism. I have taken several bottles of the VEGETINE for this complaint, and am happy to say it has entirely cured me. I have re commended the VEGETINE to others with the same good results. It is a great cleanser aud purifier of the blood; it is pleasant to take and I can cheerfully recommend it. JAMES MORSE, 364 Athens Street. Rheumatism is a Disease of the Blood. The blood in this disease, is found to con tain an excess of fibrin. VEGETINE acts by converting the blood from its diseased condi tion to a healthy circulation. VEGETINE regulates the bowels which is very important in this complaint. One bottle of Vegetine will give relief; but, to effect a permanent cure, it must be taken regularly, and may take several bottles, especially in cases of long standing. VEGETINE is sold by all Druggists. Try it, and your verdict will be the same as that of thousands before you, who say, "I never found so much relief as from the use of VEGE INE," which is com posed exclusively of Barks, Roots and Herbs. "VEGETINE," says a Boston physician, "has no equal as a blood purifier. Hearing of its many wonderful cures, after all other remedies had failed, I tested the laboratory and convinced myself of its genuine merit. It is prepared from barks, roots and herbs, each of which is highly effective, and they are compounded in such a manner as to pro duce astonishing results." VEGE TINE Nothing Equal to It. SOUTH SALEM, MASS., Nov. 14, 1876. ME. H. R. STEVNs: Dear Sir-I have been troubled with Scro fula, Canker and Liver Complaint for three years. Nothing ever did me any good until I commenced using the VEGETINE. I am now getting along first-rate, and still using the VEGETINE. I consider there is nothing equa! to it for such complaints. Can hearti ly recommend it to everybody. Yours truly, MRs. LIZZIE M. PACKARD, No. 16 Lagrange Street, South Salem, Mass. VECETINE Prepared by H. R. STEVENS, Boston, Mass.

We would like to know by what varrant of law County Commission 1rs have feed lawyers out of the 3ublic treasurv to advise them con -erning their duty. If this thing s to be continued there are many ,itizens who desire to see the au hority for it. If County Commis 3ioners cannot discharge their du ies without legal advice let them 3ither resign the office to those who ,an or pay for such advice out of bheir own pockets. They have just as much right to pay a merchant, or a farmer, or a loctor, for advice with the public money as to pay a lawyer. Gen. James Conner, of Charles Lon, who was nominated by the Greenville Enterprise and Moun aineer for the U. S. Senate, writes to that paper declining the nomina tion, and strongly urges the elec tion of -Gov. Hampton. He says that it is his settled conviction that the best interests of the State re quire the presence in the Senate of Governor Hampton. The Supreme Court of the State has decided that Probate Courts have no jurisdiction in cases of par tition of real estate; and therefore all acts done by Probate Judgvs in such cases and all sales of real es tate made by them for partition are void. Of the 124 members of the pres ent House of Representatives 89 are new men. We hope the improve ment on the last Hoase will be in the same proportion. Only seven colored men in the Legislature-four Democrats and three Republicans. Something for the New YeAr. The world renowned success of Hostetter's Bitters and their continued popularity for a quarter of a century as a stomachic, is scarcely more wonderful than the welcome that greets the annual appearance of Hostetter's Alma nac. This valuable medical treatise is pub lished by Hostetter & Smith, Pittsburgh, Pa., under their own immediate supervision, em ploying 80 hands in that department. Ten cylinder printing presses, 8 folding machines, 5 job presses, &c., are running about eleven months in the year on this work, and the is sue of same for 1879 will not be less than ten millions, printed in the English, German, French, Welsh! Norwegian, Swedish, Hol land, Bohemian and Spanish languages.
