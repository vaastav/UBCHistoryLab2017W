- WEEKLY CITIZEN. SATURDAY, DEC. 7 1S95 PURE FOOD. "Corruption wins not more than ho nesty" is a maxim that is being applied in the larger citieB, and turns to the screw are being added. Dealers in ad altered foods have had the law read to them, and if found violating it after ward have Buffered the penalties attach ed. Philadelphia is hot after bogus butter, adulterated spices, sugars, teas, coffees, milk and of all articles on the food list. New York is not behind, and perhaps is severer in its imposition of penalties. A few days ago in that city seven dealeis were fined in Special sessions $50 each, with the alternative of spending fifteen days in prison, for selling adulterated vinegar. They had ueei chemicals to improve its appearanoe, and each plead ed guilty. If the proper officers persist in their raids on adulterators of food the latter will soon sour in corrupting other thingb as well as vinegar, and this is the con dition the publio wishes to see brought about. Tucson is all right, but is much in need of su active and enterprising board of trade. Eitteepbising capitalists should keep their eyes open on the copper capabili ties of Pima county. The Sierritas district is one of the most promising in Southern Arizona considering the small amount of work done. Colorado is enjoying a veritable gold boom and Arizona when her capabili ties besome better known will promise a close eecond. President Cleveland message will contain 15,000 words. It promises to be a dreary document and any congressman who is courageous enough to sit and hear it through ought to have have his sins forgiven if he has any. Stand up for your town. Tucson has ever been and ever will continue to be am one the most substantial towns in the territory. The wheels of the wagon may turn slowly for a time but they are turning in the right direction. The gold exports for th- week jest ending amounted to $7,050,000. The gold reserve in the treasury is now down to $52,000,(0. The export of gold from this oountry since Grover Cleveland be gan his eeoond term has exceeded the amount, $100,000,000, below which it is unlawful for the gold reserve to falL Bob Ingersoll. is to be prayed into Christianity. Three thousand prayers are to be ofiered for fiix oonsecutive days in hia behalf. The supplicants before the throne of grace may not open the door of knowledge for the great un believer, but they will have the sweet conclousness of having given their faith a trial in the right direction. The jag cure law in Colorado has been declared unconstitutional. The law was passed at the last session of the state legislature and had for its object the sending of drunkards to the gold oure establishments at the county's ex pense. Silver jags may be the thing Colorado, but gold jags don't go in the Centennial state. The ban rranoisco Keport says fifty-four new gold mining companies have been organized in California in 1895. It is believed that every one of thes9 organizations has incorporated for the bona-fide object of working gold mining properties. There is no indue try in California or in any other state that ia exhibiting such activity, and the simple fact without any elaboration illustrates the present vitality ef the California mining industry and its bust ness importance. The tramp element is becoming equal to a pestilence in suburban Tucson, and householders in the outskirts of town complain of beinc pestered almoet to death by an army of ragamuffins who think the country owes them a living without labor. It is impossible, they Bay, to feed all who come along and persist in telling a tale of oe and de mand food. The Citizen has repeated ly recommended a rock pile for the uses and abuses of the . tramp element. Let them be fed well while in the city, but let them earn their food by their labor like all honest men. If they will not work voluntarily then let them be com pelled to. The ball and chain penalty was tested in the California courts re cently and was declared legal bb was also the bread and water diet to which ob streperous prisoners are occasionally subjected. If ii is a good law in Cali fornia it is a good law in Arizona and should be vigorously enforced. Seveittt Amencbns nave an estimated aggregate wealth equaling $37,500,000 each or S3,G25,C 0,000. These fortunes will form a tower of strength in the development of the gigantic enter prises of the 20th century now near at hand. Sales of mining chares in Color ado exchanges indicate the fever of speculation is not dead or dying. Gold output of Colorado now estimated at one million daily. A South African mining authority estimates the total product of all the mills in Witwater strand district from the discovery to June 30th was 7,651,933 ounces or equal to $153,105,497. United States mints stopped all coinage of silver dollars recently. The standard silver dollars is worth cow about 53 cents gold. United States mint continue coining the gold reserve bullion long held sacred and in trust United States blast furnaces are turning out pig iron at a rate of 11,500, 000 to 11,750,000 tone per annum break ing all records and exceeding consump tive demand. Eleven southern states mined 25,321,008 tons of coal in 1S94, or more than twenty times the product of the 6ame states twenty years ago. Ex ports of manufactured good nice months of 1893 were 115,793,583 against $133,378,009 a year ago. It is to be hoped the coming congress will arrange to meet the government's ordin ary expenses by protection to American industries rather than aid alienB to get our gold and displace our laborer by filling our markets with foreign-made gooda. Clapp Co., Weekly report. Presidential, booms are arriving m ' in Washington along with CoEgrees- meot although their custodians are rarely members of either houee or senate. For instance, Chairman Hackett, of the New York State retublican committee, saye: "New York is for Morton, and we expect to Fee him nomiaated. We have no second choice. We do not expect to need any. We intend to nominate Mor ton." Mr. George V. Cortie, the rich Iowa lumberman, saye: Senator Alli son will have the solid and continued support of Iowa, and he will also be the first choice of several neighboring itateP, especially those lying to the westward, and the second choice of many others." Speaker-to-be-Reed has been the planet around which everything con gressional has revrlred since his arrival in Washington eariy la6fc week. One migat suppose from the number of those who profess to know his inten tions that he had spent the entire week taking newspaper men into his confi dence, if one didn't know a "heap tight" better. Like the wice man that he is be will unquestionably do in the future as he has in the pubt allow his acts to tell his intentions and let other men, lass w ise, do the talking. He has, how ever, done two very good things, for himself aud for the republican party advised ail republican members of the bouse to go slow and to consider well before committing themselves to any particular line of policy, and absolutely refused to take any part or to express any preference in the contest for the minor house offines. Although it is believed that he has nearly or quite com pleted the assignment of members to committers he declines to dienues that matter until after he has taken hi seat as speaker. .Then it is expected that he will give the members an opportuni ty of expressing themselves on the sub ject before be announces the committees and will so far us it may be judicious make such changes es may be desired keeping in view in welfare of the party as a whole and not the ambition of indi viduals to occupy prominent places. When the committee announcements are made it will be eeen that Mr. Reed has not organized the committees of the house in the interest of his own candid ady for the republican presidential nomination but ia the interest of business-like disposition of legislation and consequently in the interest of th republican party and cf the country as wno'e. Air. Kecd is ambitious or being president, but he U more ambitious of seeing the republican party restore the prosperity of the country by its wise legislation. WHY 

GOLD GOES. It does not require a prophet, says the Virginia City Enterprise, to tell why gold is going out of this oountry in 6uch large amounts at present, although the organs and orators of the admiais tration profess to be at a loss to under stand the cause of the outflow of the yellow metal. In the nrst ten months or ls'Jo we bought $118,000,000 more and sold $11, 800,000 less abroad than in the corres ponding period of 1891. This mattes the balance of trade against us $125,000,000 more in the first ten months of the present year, and course the difference must be paid of gold. When we add to this vast amount the $100,009,000 epent by American tourists in Europe, the $75,000,000 paid for ocean freights and the $200,000,000 more which we must pay abroad every year on ac count of interest and dividends on Am erican securities held in Europe, the real wonder is that our exportation of gold is not far greater than at present Every now and then all the adminis tration organs unite in chorus to inform the country that the cause ot gold ex portation is the return of American securities unloaded on our markets be cause their foreign owners fear that silver may be restored in this country but the most cursory examination of the figures given above which, by the way are very moderate estimates in the main, must show every intelligent ob server that instead of having our secur ities returned in large amounts from Europe, we mu't be selling a great many more than we are getting back, or else a very large debt which must be met in the near future is constantly ac cumulating against us in our interna tional trade account. If our reasoning is correct the out flow of gold must increase rapidly in the near future. We shall soon see. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE- ine president s message to congress yesterday was what all true democrats expected, a strong renflirmation of his views on those subjeots which more nearly affect the catioo. He has under gone co change of opinion upon either the tariff or the financial situation and any remedy its ills demand, ilia stead fast course has been rewarded by daily attracting to his side a large and larger part not only of his own party but of the whole peop'e who were at first die tracted by doubt. After a careful read ing cf the president's messnge the term 'sound money" haa a stronger and truer manning and conviotion is brought that any other than eound money" is un sound and unsafe. The president's plan of relief will perhaps incite demagogues to the old cry that the legislation sug gested is in the interest of the rich and against the masses. Yet no honest man of business instinots and business meth od e could suggest any other. Vicious legislation has been largely responsible, not wholly eo, for the evils which it is now designed to correct. A correction may be made only by counter legisla tion. Star. The Citizen takes pleasure in repub lishing the foregoing. We do it for the purpose of giving all true democrats an opportunity to swear, not only at the national administration for foisting such pernicious doctrine upon the oountry, but also at the territorial administra tion for endorsing same and asking all good democrats to fall in line. The message is a goiu Dug document anu gold bug declarations glitter all through and yet the democracy of Arizona are told that it is "what all through demo crats expected." A better opportunity for the explosion of righteous wrath never offered. Let her go. One of the striking coincidents of the new congress is that the new members and the old ones are equally divided in number. Of the 350 members which make up the horse, 178 served in the ast congress and exactly the same num ber never served in congress at all. There are several preeidential aspir ants who will net scamble for the nomin ation but who would like awfully well to be coaxed. Reed is again to be speaker of the house by unanimous election. The in tellectual giant from Maine is once more to preside over the lawmaking power of the nation. No man on earth is better fitted for the exatled position. The president has again sent the name of Judge Peck ham to the senate for a seat on the supreme court bench. When he tried it before it was Hill's fight and Hill won. Mill's position will be watched with interest. The sultan's duplicity is liable to get a hole punched through it. England has again given notice of sending an extra guard boat through the Dardan elles, firman cr no firman. Phis time there can be no backdown if such no tice has really been given. Want of unity among the great powers has been the sole salvation of the sick man. According co senator uorman s ex planation it was his followers who elect ed the republioan ticket in Maryland. His explanation is, that the democrats of the state who believe in protection, weary of having protection periodically attacked with the attendant disastrous results to capital and labor interested in manufacturers, have turned for relief to the party which has a consistent record in favor of protection to home industries.

SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY. The largest individual employer is the Krupp company, employed m the Manufacture of artillery and iron ma chinery. It is said that this company has on its payroll about 19,000 laborers One of the most remarkable ink9 l-now to the chemist is made of a prep aration of Prussian blue in combina tion with nitric and hydrochloric acid The writing done with this ink has the singular property of fading when ex- losed to the light and recovering its color when taken into the shade or placed in jerfect darkness. Salmon packers on the Pacific coast are a trifle disturbed over news brought there last week from Petro- paulovski that the Uussians are arrang ing for the establishment of several large salmon and herring canneries alonar the Siberian coast. When the trans-Siberian railway is completed the product of these canneries is likely to le a considerable factor in European markets. Large tracts of sand wastes arc now being reclaimed along the Welsh coast. Series of parallel fences are put vn seaward, closely interwoven with wires and furze, and spaces between these are filled with earth and road scrapings. In these various trees, such as sycamore, willow, pine and alder, are planted, while the ridges are sown with gor:-e and broom seed and planted with brier. Mr. Wilckens, of Vienna, has found that two pure-blooded English horses transmitted the color of their coat to th"ir nn-'fi'iiiture in 5J eaes cut of 1,000. When the parents are of differ ent colors, the offspring are almost always of the colorof the mother. With Arabian horses the facts a re more strik ing still. The white color of the coat of the mare was found to be clearly transmitted in 729 cases out of 1,000. In other eases there was a more or less marked mixture. The soldiers and workers of the white ants (Termes), are, as a rule blind, with no traces of eyes: but a species has been found in South Africa, the workers and soldiers of which have eyes and work in daylight, like ordinary ants.

Dr. Sharp thinks this species may lo allied to the Termes viarum of Sineathman, whose soldiers and work ers possess eyes. Experiments have shown that birds avoid the bright-colored caterpillars as a rule. And this seems almost to have become a second nature, for a jackdaw. which had been raised in captivity and had had no experience in judging the edible qualities of caterpillars, was ob served to regard the brilliant cater pillar of the figure-of-eight moth with suspicion and aversion, although it eagerly devoured dull, plain caterpil lars placed within its reach.

He Eiye "The present assemblage of the legis lative branch of our government occurs at a time when the interests of our peo ple and the needs of the country give a speoial prominence to the oondition of our foreign relations, and the exigencies of our national finances. I, therefore. deem my executive duty adequately per formed at tnis time by presenting to congress jthe important phases cf our intercourse with foreign nations, and a statement of the financial problem which confronts us." President Cleveland notes the open ing of the free wool market in the Ar gectice Republic, and also that the boundary differences between that na tion and Brazil have been esttled by ar bitration, in which this country acted as arbiter. The resumption of specie payment by China is regarded as evino- ing the ascendancy of sound financial principles in that nation. lhe close of the Japanese-Chinese war has developed a domebtio condition in tho Chinese empire, which ha9 called for prompt attention, owing to the man ifestation cf the aversion of the Chi nese to all foreign ways and undertak ings; moo attacks on foreign missions, oausicg much loss of life and property have been the result. Although but one American suffered, it was plainly the part of this government to take prompt action, and a special American commis sion has gone overland from Tien-Tbio to demonstrate the readiness of our government to check similar outbursts. The cordial relations with France bave been undisturbed, with the excep tion of a full explanation of the treat ment of John L. Waller, formerly Unit ed States consul at Tancavate, Mada gascar, remains to be explained. Mr. Waller remained in Madagascar after his term of office expired, having pro cured business concessions of value, and upi'D the declaration of marshal law by the French, he wes arrested for various chorgep, tried and convicted by a mili tary tribunal and sentenced to twenty years in prison, ihis government re quested the records of that tribunal, the records of the proceedings and charges have been procured, but Ue evidence is etill missing. Meanwhile it appears that Mr. Waller's confinement was cjt onerous. The president recommends the ao ceptacce cf the rrench invitation to participate in the Paris exposition of 1900. He especially commends the re cent resolution of the French chambers favoring a permanent treaty of arbitra tion between the two countries. The close rivalries of competing industries, the influence of the delusive doctrine that the internal development of a na tion is promoted and its wealth increas ed, by a policy which in undertaking to reserve its homo markets for the exclus ive use of its own producers, necessar ily obstructs their sales in foreign mark ets, and prevents free access to the pro ducts of the world, is the president's summary of of the trade conditions with Germany. The exports affected are largely American cattle and food pro ducts. But insurance companies are also suffering. The president suggests retaliatory measures, and exami nation warrants them, while declaring the policy of this country as a produc ing nation, should be marked with na tional good faith and reciprocal forbear ance. An appropriation for the survey cf the Alaskan boundary is recommended, as is also the sum of $425,003 in full settlement of the British sealing claims. A commission to eettle the boundary lines with Canada is urged. In reference to Venezuela the presi dent maintains the Monroe doctrine in opposing a forcible increase by any Eu ropean power of its territorial puwer on this continent, and suggests that Great Britain submits its olaims to arbitra tion. The president touches biiefly on the Hawaiian question, ending by saying that Mr. Thurston, the Hawaiian min ister, furnished abundant rtisons for a?kicg taat he be recalled. A change in the alien laws is suggest ed, which will oheck the vicious sys tem which at present overcomes the im migration aod contract labor laws. The president has co suggestions in the Nicaraguan case.but expect a peace ful settlement with such consideration and indulgence toward Nicaragua as are consistent. The president asks legislation to break the treaty, or agreement, by which this country is jointly bound with England aod Germany tJ assume management cf Samoa. Speoial attention is called to the sit uation in Cuba, and the strict neutrality of this government is advised, despite the sentimental sympathy and adventur ous support arousad in America by stories of cruelties, aod the natural love of liberty, military arrests of Ameriacn citizens, the rights of the American con sular officers to protect property, aud the Alliance incident, have been recog nized and are explained. Occurrences in Turkey, while excit ing concern, information is hard to get; but our consul at Sivas has been in structed to investigate. It is not the intention of this government to become entangled in the eastern question, but simply to care for those entitled to its protection, ships have been sent to the point of aotual disturbance, and on demand of our minister, orders have been issued by the sultan, that Turkish' soldiers shall guard an escort of Amer ican refugees to the coast.. 1 1 is earnest ly hoped that prompt and effective action on the part of the great European powers will not be delayed. Owing to the growth of American in terests in foreign countries the improve ment of the csnsular service is urged In accordance with the reoemmecda tion of the secretary of state, it has been decided to fill consular position payirg from $1,000 to $2,500 annually by application or transfer from some other position in the department of state. These promotions are to be made by examination, and include 100 place? Legislation in needed for consular in spection; the president recommends that ambassadors and ministers at foreign eourts be provided with official resid ences. He advocates that while avoid ing the glitter and show of foreign nations, this country should not suffer by comparison through the shabbine-s and parsimony ot its diplomatic corps As we turn from a review of our foreign relations to the contemplation of our national financial situation, we are im mediately aware that we approach a subject of domestic concern more im portant than any other that can engage our attention, and one at preeent in such a perplexing and delicate predicament, as to require promp and wise treatment. We may well be encouraged to earnest effort iu this direction, when we recall the steps already taken towards improv ing our economic and financial situa tion; and when we appreciate how well the way has been prepared for further progress, by an aroused and intelligent popular interest on the subjects. By oommacd ot tne people, a customs rev enue system designed for the protec tion and benefit of favored classe?, at the expense of the great mass of our countrymen, and which, while inefficient for the purpose of revenues, curtailed our trade relations and impeded our entrance to the markets of the world, has been superseded by a tariff policy wnicn in principle is cased upon a denial of the right. The compulsory purchase and coinage of silver by the government unchecked and regulated by business conditions and heedless of our currency needs, wnicn lor more than fifteen years diluted our circulat ing medium, undermined confidence abroad in our financial ability end at last culminated in distress and panic to home, has been recently stopped by the repeal of the laws which forced this reckless scheme upon the country. The things thus accomplished, notwithstand ing their extreme importance and benefi cent effects, fall far short of curing the monetary evils from which we suffer, as a result ot long indulgence in ill advised financial expedients. After explaining the resumption of specie payment, and the creation of a reserve gold fund of 8100,000,000, the president gives a brief monetary history of the United States, quoting the faoi that in July '90 congress provided for the purchase of Bilver bullion, but decided that gold and silver must be kept at a parity. The redeemed trea sury notes treated as geld obligations in '03 amounted to $155,000,000, with 5500,000,000 outstanding. This served to deplete the gold reserve in April TO to 697,000,330; and the president ascribes its further depletion to hih tariff laws in vogue until the passage of the Wilson bill, together with the infusion of silver into the country and the iccreasicg agitation for its free coinage. In conse quence of these conditions, the reserve had fallen in February '04 to cC5,433,377 a decrease of $3,000,000 in nine months To relieve this state of affairs $102,000,- 000 in bonds were issued in three periods, under the redempt.on act of '05. President Cleveland explains the neces sity for the Morgan syndicate cantraot ard declares if at its special seesion in July congress had authorized the issuance of 3 percent bonds, $10,000,000 would have been 6aved. Despite these efforts, the gold reserve is about in the same condition, there being but $79, 333,066 on hand at present. Between '79 and "J() but iSiS.OW.WU ot gold was withdrawn, while between '00 and '95 the amount is $375,000,000. This is attributed to the increased purchase of silver. The government has paid in gold nine-tenths of notes and owes them all.' It has incurred a bonded indebted ness of 105,500,000 in establishing the gold reserve; and expended $162,315,400 in an effort to maintain it; besides an annual interest of $11,000,000. Im mediate legislative relief is asked. Greenbacks and treasury notes should be retired by exchanging the bonds with small denominations. The seretary cf the treasury should be empowered to sell bonds abroad for gold, in order to can cel these notes. The amount ot cur rency thus withdrawn would not be over $486,000,000, which would be supplied by gold. The presid ent buggests as a relief to circula tion that banks be allowed to iaeua cotes to the full amount of bonds deposited, and the tax on their circula tion be reduced one-fourth cf one per cent; as a further relief it is suggested that revenue collections be made pay able in gold. Not to pay out United States and treasury notes on demand, and to insnt on paying in silver notes, the president deolares it would injure the parity between gold and silver which the government is bound to main tain. An excess of revenue receipts would not alter the question cf national sol vency, as the struggle to maintain the gold reserve the treasury could not pay debts with the money it had, but enly with gold end that to foreign investors, is the only concern as the withdrawal of gold is a dirtct result cf fright, there is nothing to alleviate the situation so much as legislation which will lessen the desire for gold. It is cot clear how any increase in revenue, unless it be in gold, cau satisfy those whose only desire is to draw gold from the government store. Therefore, a revenue increase is depreciated. Speaking of the proposit ion to relieve the financial situation by the free coinage cf silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, the president declares no human contrivance, no act ot legislation has ever been able to hold the two metals together in free coinage at a ratio of appreciable difference from that which is established in the markets ot the world. A change in the standard to silver monometallism would bring a collapse to our entire credit system. THE 

SENATE. Washington, Dec 3The senate in executive session today confirmed the nominations cf Richard Olney, as sec retary cf state, and Judson Harmon, as attorney-general; and at 3 o'clock ad journed until tomorrow, shutting off de bate from several senators primed with epeecbes on Cuba and Venezuela. Stew art introduced the usual free silver bill. At 1:40 the reading of the message was completed, and on motion of Gorman, it was laid on the table and ordered print ed. Cullom presented a communication from Evacston, Ills., asking government action concerning the deplorable con dition ot affairs in Turkey. Gallin?er offered a similar communication from the citizens of New Hampshire; reeolu tions of the Idaho legislature urging the election ot United States senators by popular vote, wa9 presented by Dubois, Lodge was the first to secure recognit ion for the introduction of bills and resolutions.

Cou don, the Tiew chaplain, blind Univerca- list preacher from Port Huron, Mich., delivered an invocation. Hayne (rep.) ot New York, chairman of the committee appointed to wait on the president, reported that Mr. Cleve land sent his respectful salutations to cocgreesand would commuicate io writ ing. Immediately thereafter Mr. Pruden th6 president's executive clerk, appeared with the message, which the clerk read The members listened, some intently but all respectfully to the words of the chief executive. Not during the entire reading of the message was there a single manifesto tion of approval rr disapproval, but at the conclusion of the reading, which occupied an hour and a half, there was slight scattering cf applause. At 1:50 p. m. the house adjourned until Friday. Washington, Do. 1 Sixty-two mem bers of the democratic minority met in caucus yesterday afternoon to form a democratic organization and renominate the officers in the last cocgrpes. Cul berson cf Texas was elected chairman of the democratic caucus for the fifty fourth congress to succeed Hoi man of Indiana, Robinson ot Louisiana and Rusk ot Maryland were elected caucus secretaries. Ex-Speaker Crisp was named for the third term unanimously. Other officers of the fifty third congress were selected as the democratic slate without opposition. The selection of three or four minor officers whom the minority were permitted to came was postponed. In nominating Crisp, Richardson touched upon the future policy of the pirty. "Lay aside all new facgled doctrine and continue to battle for the reduction of taxaticn cn the people, give them cheaper clothing and supplies; broaden and make a better market for the prod ucts of the farms and manufactures; reduce public expenses; greater simplic ty in navonal n flairs; home rule and ationul self government; ample circul ting medium for trade and commeice; sound money; gold Bnd silver coinage cf be constitution and democracy will Hgnin be triumphant and the country will be redeem and regenerate." Crisp responded briefly, expressing his thanks. The best of feeling prevailed and there was a tendency to bring the financial question forward, although gold and silver leaders were both present. A number of republican senators in cluding Haasbrougb, Pettigrew, Clark, Carter, Mantel, Dubois, bhoup, Chand ler, Gallinger and Proctor held an in formal meeting last night and decided to advocate an attempt to reorganize the tne senate in the caucus Monday. They also pronounced in favor of a distribu tion of the appropriation bills among the various senate committees and also discused the committee assignments of senator?. It was evident the westerm men would stand together to Becure con trol of the committees which deal es pecially with western questions. The republicans of the house of repre sentatives met in oaucus tonight and uc aoimously nominated ex-Speaker Tho 9. B. Reed for speaker of the 51th congress. This action was anticipated, as no effort has been inaugurated to contest hia election. Calush Grow, speaker of the house in 1S59, nominated Reed. Previous to Reeds nomination the caucus organized by electing Groevern- or of Ohio chairman of the caucus, Ellis of Oregon secretary. These officers served during the session. The follow ing officers were elected by the caucus: Clerk, Alexander McDowell of Pepn- sylvania; seargeant-at-arms, Benj. F. Uussell of Missouri: doorkeeper. Wm J.
