'1'here is an economic crisis in England, and an alarming percentage of the population are loaf ers, with the number daily increas ing. As strange as this may seem, the new ministry goes into office with out any Idea of trying to remedy this state of affairs, which is alleged by the eminent Joseph Chamberlain to be due to the policy of free trade which England has been persuing for sixty years. Chamberlain's cry against free trade was met by the Liberals with the cry of "free bread," which means that present conditions will continue until the people become converted to Chamberlain's ideas of protection, with differential rates in favor of all the English colonies. This is the most tremendous scheme that has been sprung in the world for a long time, with far reaching effects. Suppose it goes into effect, admitting to England free of duty, for instance, everything from Can ada and placing a tariff on everything from the United States. It is easy to imagine the effects.
