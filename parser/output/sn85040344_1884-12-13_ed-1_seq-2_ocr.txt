I’redlclin About Riislnpitt. New Vor'; letter. Who i' Benner, the Indiana funn er? Why don't vou Western newspa pers that haven’t anything else to do, find out and let us know? “Bonner’s Predictions’’ a queer little book with a fantastic coyer is making a sensation in New York. The book-stand at the U inds >r hotel has so hi 200 copies of it in two months. Some of our most successful speculators are said to he governed Iy it. Of all the bears who made their pile a year ago in the fall of stocks. Cam mack is about the only one of them all who had sense enough to go out at the right time, and so held his own. Woeriscboffer, Clews and others kept in the current and let their pile on a rise in July and Au gust an 1 lost all they had taken out of Jay Could, Vanderbilt and the North ern Pacific, and more too. Camraack says he went out last spring because Benner told him to. He claims that Benner actually did predict correctly the financial variations of the last eight years in his hook printed in l>7tj and he jin~ his faith on Benner’s new predictions, as follows: “1884 —Presidential year, dull trade; iron drooping; lower prices. lw")—little improvement; railroad stocks higher. 188(i —renewed de pression; stocks lower. 1887 —the same. 1888—presidential, hard times; business prostrated; banks failing; stocks at lowest point; upward turn of affairs this year. 1889—now fora boom' lx (I) —great activity and pros perity. 1891—speculation and a pan ic. 18)2, 1893, 1894, 1895, 1890, T s ‘- ! 7 —(lull years and poor trade. 1898 and 1899, good trade, active bus ines.-; century winds up in height of speculative car.” Homier claims that trade moves in cycles, and that hard times have struck us about once in ten years on an av erage. Ihe most colossal liars that in ha! it this terrestrial ball may he found in Duluth. 4he lies told bv the den izens of that hamlet are so silly, how ever, that they hardly need alluding to. Their latest we find in the Pioneer Press of Monday, and is dated the oth hist., and is to the effect that no grain elevators can ever be built ou the Wis cousin side of tlioSt. Louis or Superior bavs because no solid foundation can , be found on which to place such a structure, and that Duluth is the onlv place at the head of the lake where an elevator can find a safe resting place. It i> contemptible in uue to so lie about his neighbor, but the liar gener ally ge!> tlie worst of it in the long i run, tor, when people come to investi gate the matter the lie appears plainly and operates against those who put it in circulation. There are other good points for elevator plants on Lake Su perior, no doubt, but none better than Superior, and the day is not far dist ant wlu n the most of the grain grown iu the great North-west will pass through Superior elevators on its wav to Europe or our own eastern markets. I hat libelous attack on Mr. S. E. i uhhs in the Inter-Ocean last week, proved a regular boomerang to the little clique of schemers who thought to do Mr. Tubbs an injury. Men of all parties immediately rallied to Mr. Dibits support and defense, while the squad of detainers of character, slunk into the shade and swore vehe mently at their failure. We are glad to he able to state, however, that Mr. fay lor, the proprietor of the paper was not in the city at the time the an and. and c mdemns it as severely as any one, and promptly dis charged the party, who as acting edi tor, wrote- the article. It was a dirty piece of work, and as usual in such eases, the parties doing the work, are the ones most bedaubed and disgraced by it. Hie article was clearly libelous, but whether Mr. Tubbs will commence suit against the sheet or not, lias not vet been decided. —One of the Duluth papers says tlu' people of Superior are afraid that Duluth will ct 1 "> close to Super! >r.

OUR WASHINGTON LETTER. Sinvial Correspondence. Wa<hix(*to.v, Dec. oth 1884. 1 be fir-t week of the second session of the 48th Congress has ended. Already both of the Legislative bodies have settled down to work. This they ■hd almost a j naturally and quietly as it only a week instead of five months had intervened between the 'ast and present meeting. On last Monday wh m the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House brought down their gavels ex actly at noon, thus opening Congress, crowds of visitors filled tlie galleries; both chambers had an air of freshness, and cleanliness, and the desks of Sen ators and Representatives were load ed with flowers. Otherwise there was but little to indicate that it was the beginning of anew session. Due interesting and decidedly un usual feature of the occasion was the good natured chaffing indulged in by the Democrats at the expense of their Republican friends, over the result of the Presidential election. The Re publicans took the bantering in good part, and no bitterness was manifest ed. Congressman Cox of New York was conspicuously busy in ottering condolence to his political opponents. 1 he Democrats are in good spirits, but the Republicans skillfully conceal anv dejection they may feel. The South ern Members arc not so demonstrative us it was predicted they would be. They congratulated each other on the Democratic victory, hut they seemed to be impressed with the duty of re straining hilarity in the presence of their defeated opponents. The Presidents message was listened to in both Houses] with the usual in attention. The proportion of Senators and Members who lounged and look ed bored, and tried to kill time was considerably greater than the mini her of attentive listeners. Congressmen consider the official reading of clerks Very monotonous, and prefer to got their impressions of an Executive doc ument from their own perusal of it. After an extended inquiry among them I learn thaN as a whol *, they think President Arthur s last annual message is his best. ’ They praise it for its dignity, for its temper and for the clearness and simplicity of its stylo. But the report of the Secretary of the Treasury is more commented upon than the Presidents message. It has been called the most vigorous present ation of the finaeial conditon of the country that has ever been made. Mr. McCulloch has pleased the friends of lower taxes in his Tariff recommend ations, but his position will doubtless excite a great deal of dissent in his own party. The first sensation of the session was raised in the House of Represent atives by Congressman Follett’s im peachment resolutions. He brought charge* againt Marshall Lot W right in connection with the employment of deputy BMarshals at the election in Cincinnati!. A short, bitter debate followed in which Messrs, Converse, Hiscork, Reed, Brumm, Miller, and ex-Speaker Keitt’er took part, and the resolutions were finally adopted. The new Senator, Mr. Sheffield, who is the temporary successor of the late Senator Anthony of Rhode Island is about sixty years old. He is quite lame and walks laboriously with the assistance of a large cane. He has a few straggling locks of hair, which he combs over a bald head, a benevolent countenance, and prefers, for an ev ery day garment, ala Senator Conger, and Representative Poland a swallow tailed coat. Senator Logan occupies his old scat in the Senate chamber between the two Maine Senators, and was the first man to break the brief silence after tlie chaplains prayer on opening day. Democrats as well as Republicans sought the first opportunity to shake ban Is with.the defeated candidate and pass some words of friendly greeting. Gen. Logan met them all with a smile and ready reply, but it was evident that his old time exuberance of spirits could not be summoned at will. Coiintr.v \i , n>pii|)or , <, Philadelphia Times. Country papers arc the most useful ami least compensated of all the agen cies which stamp the impress of pro gress upon villages and inland cities. Without the aid of local newspapers local towns are, as a rule, thriftless and dead. It is common for small gn at m n to speak with contempt of the local newspaper, but the village newspaper makes more great men out of less material —more brick without straw —than any other in politics, and it is the one ladder on which men climb to local distinction as the be ginning of wider fame. The advent of the local newspaper has always dated the increased thrift of the community. The local newspaper is the life of the locality, and the measure of its sup port. as a rule measures the advance ment of the people. Not only sub scribe but pay for your local newspa pers.

Washington, Special Telegram Dee. sth—The argument of the \\ in ona tV St. Peter land case ha* given the town a good joke. Judge \\ ilson says at one point in his brief: Lord Bacon has wisely and truly written, ‘‘The letter killeth, but the spirit makes alive.” Is it not enough if a man substantially complies with the spirit of the law, if he does not comply with its every letter? If he honestly believes be bus done so and acts accordingly, with his good faith and honest intent not be considered by this department in the interpretation of the law? (ien. Gordon E. Cole opened his brief as follows: The claimant's counsel in this case is either grossly ignorant of the law or has broken his oath as an attorney, for he does not know that Lord Ba con did not write the epistle to the Corinthians, or he is trying to mislead the interior department by falsehood and deceit, by quoting the Apostle Paul as good authority in land cases. When the great apostle wrote to the people of Corinth ‘ The letter killeth but the spirit giveth life,” he had no reference to timber culture cases, and in fact the act entitled, “An act to encourage the growth of timber in \\ estern prairies, - ’ had not become a law in A. 1). GO, nor did it become a law until 1800 years later, so it is clearly to be seen that the language quoted is not in point. There is one thing in bis argument also that is to be regretted, and that is the charge of plagarisiu against the great lord chan cellor of England. Bacon has been charged with being the author of plays commonly credited to Sbak and also with corruption in ofliee; but this new thrust of literary piracy is extremely unjust, coming at tiiis late date from a member of the Minnesota bar. A Second Si.Tlit* Ssi;M*rior round. F. 11. Bignell of Quebec, who left June last in command of a transport expedition of Lake Mistassini has re turned. He gives a few particulars taken en route. The party with great difficulty reached provinces on the northern boundary on Height of Land. They then crossed into Rupert’s land and at a distance of 360 miles from Lake St. John they reached the south western extremity of the great Luke Mistassini. He states that the general trend of the lake as far as known is from southwest to northeast stretching away from Foam buy and Height of Land in the southwest to an unknown distance toward the east of Maine and Labrador. The waters swarm with fish of all kinds and fur bear ng animals are abundant. The climate is agree able and suitable for agricultural pur poses. It is stated that the Hudson Bay company have had their agency there f>r upwards of 100 years, but have held it secret that a lake of such dimensions ever existed. It is sup posed to be as large as Lake Superior. —The report of (Vunmissi mer of Indian Affiairs, Hiram Price, for the year 1884, places the Indian popula tion of Wisconsin at 6 628, of whom all hut 1,210 are enrolled under agents.

Cremation. The destruction of human remains through the action of lire was the mod extensively used and was considered the most honorable mode by most of th ~ nations of antiquity. Aad thence the idea of the funeral ptre and urn sepulture is as much Associated with heatheirsm as burial in the earth is with C. hristiauity, though ilicro is. in truth, no necessary conne -t on between the two. Though it is now’ well asecr ta ned that the body of the poet Shelley was burnt from reasons perta ning to the quarranline regulations, it was al the time considered an additional proof, had any been required, of his de termined hostility to ( hristiaa o iserv ances, and it was with some I tfle diffi culty that a clcrgym 11 could be per suaded to read t lie burial service over his remains. The Greeks commonly buried the r dead on the sixth or sev enth dav after death: but up to that time myrrh, gum of cedar tree, salt, wax and many costly and sweets cute 1 drugs, honey, balm and bitumen w ire used to prove it an disagreeable odor. The funeral pile it-elf was 0111 posed of fir or pine wood, g ncruliy ia the form of an altar. Bitch, turpentine and other intlamnlab’e substan es were spread over the pile, and cypress trees wore set around at a ceiia.u and stance. Then the e.c- of the corpse were gen erally opene 1. and if a wind arose it was considered a favorable omen. When a 1 was eonsum the calcimnl bones and ashes, soaked ai costly wno , were gathered together and placed in the funeral urn, which was c m-igned to the sepulcher. The Ro mans interred their ilea I, in the tir.il in stance, and adopted the cu-tom of burning them from the (Wrecks but not tax a very great extent until low aril the end of tee Rcpubli •. It was most gen eral under tlie Emperors, and gradual ly fell into and snse about the md 0 the fourth century, when ChriM auity became the prevalent creed. But the Gnek and Roman laws a! kc prohibi c l the burning or bury.ng of the dea l withui any city, both fron san tary and civil considerations. The (■reek koimetcrion, or i ed of slum’ cr, was generally at a considerable dis tan o outside o the towns. The Ro mans irei.ue tly ma le their tombs by the roads dc. and when the ! odies of the latter were not burnt they were in closed in stoti' colitis. So sacred were t e tombs that they served often as a place of refuge in times of pcr.se, ntion. The resting place of the Jews was Bcth am. For 1 1 1 0 most part they buried their dead, burning street spices on the couch where the corose rested. < re ti niion was, however. not en irtly un used among them, as reference to the books of the O and 'lest.uucnt will show. Of Asa. King of Juda >, it is recorded “And they bur ed him in his own sc, u tlior, which he ha i made tor him self in !he City of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices ore pared bv the apothecaries’ art, and they made a very great burning for hiui'’ (2 Chron. xvi:l4). “All the vid ian men arose and went all night aad took l ie h >dy of Saul and the bodies of his s‘-n irorn the wail <1 Bethshar, and came to Jabe-h. and I urnt them there. And they took their bones and buried them under a tree at Jabcsh, and lasted seven days.” (1 Sam. xwill2, 1:5).
