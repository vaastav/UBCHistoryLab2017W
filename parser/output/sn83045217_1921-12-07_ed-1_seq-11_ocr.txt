B. Lake & Co.). New York, Dec. 6.—The market at the opening today displayed a very Strong tone but as the session went along some Irregularity developed which tended to give a mixed appearance to the general list during the remainder of the session. Some profit taking made its appearance in certain portions of the list where ad vances have been vigorous and this was particularly true of the equipments and steels On the other hand other indi vidual issues, especially Studebaker, were taken In hand and moved forward. The president's mssage delivered today in its entirety was of very convictive interpretation and this had a helpful effect on sentiment. Money continued in rather liberal supply and conspicuous strength was in évidence in the foreign exchange markets. We are more dis posed to believe that stock market prices will continue to exhibit advanc ing tendencies.—Logan & Bryan. NEW

Dec. 6.—The stock market -was fairly active and broad again to dav, but the only shares to display con . •; , x ^' *1 Vx, sistent strength were, those favored by technical conditions, namely, an exten sive short interest. Favorable developments, such, as Pres ident Harding's message to congress and the strength of foreign exchange, failed to stimulate public support, but impelled considerable short covering In th later dealings. The one feature of the president's message which seemed to cause disap pointment was his qualified reference to the country's merchant marine. Ship ping reacted sharply, mercantile marine preferred being under marked pressure. Declaration of regular dividends by numerous industrial companies includ ing American Car and Foundry, and payment of several deferred dividends indicated more hopeful trade prospects. Motors, rubbers, oils, chemicals, mer chandising and utility issues, featured tj, e constructive side of extreme gains of one t0 S j x points. Rails lagged until we u toward the finish, when Lehigh valley became the center of Interest. steels, equipments and leathers were moderately reactionary. Sales totalled 750,000 shares. Ca n loans ruled at 4% per cent until tlie final hour, an unexpected inquiry then forcing the rate to five per cent. Q n prime collateral, 30 and 60 day loans were made In moderate amounts at 4% P er e« 111 - Settlement of the Irish question caus ed a brisk rise in sterling exchange to 408% for demand bills, that figure ex ceding the maximum of the last two years. Important and continental rates, including German marks, were five to 15 points higher and Swiss francs at i9 8o equalled their par of pre-war value. Further realizing sales accounted for tlve irregular tone of the bond market, that condition applying especially to Liberty and Victory issues. Rails re acted to the heavy trend of Pennsyl vania and St. Louis issues and inter nationals were less active than at any recent period. Total sales (par value) $20,750,000.

BROWN, EIGHT ROUNDS Memphis,c Tenn.', Dec. 6. — Carl Tremaine, Cleveland bantamweight, knocked out K. O. Brown, of New Orleans, in the fourth round of a scheduled eight round bout here Mon day night. CMcag® Mairkett GRAIN AND PROVISIONS. Chicago, Dec. 6.—Wheat underwent material setback in price here today ow ing largely to reports of poor demand for cash wheat and flour at Minneap olis. The close was heavy, 1% cents to 3 cents net lower, with May $1.12% to $1.12%, and July $1.01% to $1.01%. Com lost % cents to 1%@1% and oats % to %. In provisions, the outcome varied from unchanged figures to 7% cents advance. Before starting to decline, the wheat market temporarily showed consider able firmness. Prospects that Germany would be granted three years respite from cash indemnity payments appeared' to have much to do with the early up turns in price. Gossip was also current about crop deterioration in Argentina, that country being represented as re buylng grain which had been sold to Great Britain. Demand here, however, lacked volume, and bulls seemed to lose confidence when news came that Minne apolis wheat stocks were increasing and that the milling demand for wheat in any position had fallen off. Scattered liquidation here ensued, and with no ag gressive support in sight. The finish was at the lowest level of the day. President Harding's recommendation to congress that the Russian relief com mission be given 10,000,000 bushels of corn had no apparent effect on the corn market. The country sold corn rather liberally to arrive, and prices were on the down grade from the start. Oats receeded with other grain. Higher quotations on hogs gave a little firmness to provisions.
