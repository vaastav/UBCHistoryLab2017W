New York, which has no woman suffrage, as In Cal ifornia, where women have the full franchise. Primary elections are not constitutional elections. Any regulations can be made for them by congress, and there |* every reason why the women should par ticipate In the nomination of presi dential candidates. This will certainly appeal to President Wilson and Monetary Jlryan, who are known to cherish a deep and abiding doalre for vot'-n f,r women, but who have so far hesitated to proclaim their feellngH openly.
