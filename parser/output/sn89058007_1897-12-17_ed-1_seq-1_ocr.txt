Tho report deals at length with the lurkish massacres, and says that while many Christians were killed or fled, the number of professed Christians exceeds that previous to the outrages. In India during the famine food rose to abnormal prices. As a large number of the poor of India nearly one-third of all her people livj con- ttantly upon the verge of starva tion, when prices are normal, it is easy to imagine the result of such times as these. Grain riots occurred in many places, starvation stared mil lions in the face, and almost at once became an awful real; t v. This has been bv far the most fruit ful year in the history of the south China mission. In the Foo-Chow (China) mission, within the last two years there has been an expansion of field and growth in churches, schools and hospital work unparalleled in the history of our 'missions in China. There are but five unordained mission aries and in a field, which includes 2, 000,000 souls. The North China mission, ocate d near the political center of the empire. giving access to more than 20,000,000 souls, ably manned and well estab lished in seven wisely-chosen centers, is one of the most important and prom ising under the care of the board.

The educated Japanese are carefully studying the social and religious ques tions in which the scholars of the west are interested, and always the begin nings of enlightenment are subjects of doubt and questioning. In Hawaii, one great drawback to rapid progress is the backward condi tion of the Hawaiian churches. Too large a proportion of Hawaiian church members are not only ignorant of the fundamental requirements of personal rectitude, but indifferent to the obliga tion of common honesty in the regular payment of the promised salaries of their pastors.
