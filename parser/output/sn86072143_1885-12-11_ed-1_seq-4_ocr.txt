President Cleveland disposes of callers at tliu rate of two in one and one-fourth seconds. One might suppose tliat Mr. Cluveiand had served an apprenticeship in a newspaper olllcc. Secretary Whitney evidently made his report a labor of love. It is a very excel lent treatise on an important subject. Iiut sometimes carefully elaborated theories do not work in practice. The silver men are naturally very angry over the ungloved manner in which they are handled in the President's message. Dut they do not succeed in offsetting his facts, or answering his arguments. The movement to compel a reduction of telephone rates in Worcester, Mass., by a general removal of instruments has failed. No one of a trade would take out his tele phone unless all of the same business re moved theirs. ft is mentioned that the government is selling the lust of the lint lelt over from the war. It is a wonder that the vivid imaginations of some of our Democratic contemporaries do not lead them to con sider this another "resurrection of the bloody shirt." Six Newark, N. .1:, children who were bitten by a mad dog have been sent to M. Pasteur at Paris, to be treated by his al ready famous virus inoculation process. A fund has been subscribed to defray their expenses. The experiment will be watched with great interest. The department estimates for govern mental expenses during the ensuing year are rather appalling. They amount to a grand total of s;;a,.-W,,r'-"-. Hut then we must remember that this is a great coun try, and produces an extraordinarily large number of ollicehoiders. Recent captures of mediums while in the act of personating departed sp'r'l.s arc casting fresh odium upon "So' . it'"mii.'" Either spiritualism itself !s in' t or ' s leading professors are frauds and there s not much to choose between these rller natives. Senator Hoar's bill providing for the Presidential succession in the case of the death of both the President and the Vice President is to be taken.up again early in the present .session, and will probably be passed. The Democrats can have no pos sible objections to it now that they are in Iiower. It remains to be seen whether .lay j Gould can retire from Wall street. After a life spent in the daily whirl of linancial I excitement, will it be possible for him to I llndauy rent or satisfaction in domestic j and social life ?

If .Mr. (Jould succeeds, i it will be his greate.it achievement. j Congressman Hland announces to a re-1 porter that he expects to defend his dollar ; II Congre.-s, not because he "loves it so," but becau-e Ills western constituents are ! so .strongly in tavorof its continued com-1 age.

Probably not one person in ten ever reads a President's message. Hut those who read Mr. Cleveland's, wit li any care, must icalize the fact that our shipof State is a big concern, and that lie who stands at the helm and undertakes to guide its course and to care wisely for the multi-, furious interests concerned, has no light task upon ids hands. The position of chief magistrate of this republic, is not an ' enviable one. i of all Hnglishtneu who have visited i merica, none lias left behind him a 1 pleasanter impression than the distin guished gentlemen who sails for home to day. Canon Furrar has proved himself to lie n true friend of tho United states. He camo to us with outstretched hands and departs with words of eulogy of America which we trust lie will never have occa sion to consider over-drawn. One of the heaviest items of expenso in running steamships is that of coal. Tho fast Cunarders, Ktrurla, Umbria and Or egon burn between :iOO and Iftfj tons each daily. Hut there is an American steamer, of tho Cromwell Lino, having a speed within eighteen per cent of that or tho fast transatlantic vessels and earning more freight, which makes the lound trip from New York to Now Orleans and buck, ten dujs of steaming, with thosuino amount of coal that is consumed in a single day by any one of tho big Cunard. ers. This seems like a big story , but it is literally true. It Is stated that the cable method ol ptopelllng ears lias caused more accidents, since Its Introduction Into some of out large wiles, than any other mode of con veyance. However this may be, the le ccnt accident on the ISrooklyn bridge, e (Used by the liiilure of a train to grip the cable, shows that it Is liable to very ser ious fiilluies. In thai, botli grip nnd brakes railed to hold, and thete was a bad smasliup, Tho curly town aichives of .Massachu setts reveal the fact that huge numbers of the men and still larger numbers of the women, among the llrst settlers, made their marks Instead of writing their sig natures in legal transactions. Thete was more illiteracy than has been commonly supposed among the Puritans ; but they laid the foundations for schools which should leave their descendants no excuse for not knowing how to read and write. King Kalakana wants to sell the Culled States theSandwlch Mauds ior.?t l.fiou.OOi). Kalakana would feel safer as a protege o" tho roiled States, governing under a Re publican constitution, and the fourteen million and odd would be ample compen sation for that obsolete bauble known as a crown. It would be a good bargain for Kalakana, no doubt, and perhaps good for this country. It is objected to the mayor of Louisville that lie lias been personally engaged lu three street lights during his term of of lice, if the people of Louisville are get ting so high-toned that these little affairs of honor are no longer considered to lur nish titles for re-elictlon, the mayor should conclude that he is not iuite far enough West. There are many cities toward the setting sun waiting to honor him. . In some cases of de.-perate illness, when the patient seemed unlikely to recover through weakness, transfusion of blood from a healthy person has been re torted to with success, it has been dis covered that the infusion of warm salt water into the arteries answers the same purpose; and the success of this experi ment in a recent case in Iiellevue hospital, New York city, opens new possibilities to the medical profession. Dead men tell no ta'cs, and it is not gen erally tho custom to tell any tales about them. Hut General ifosccraus's animosity refuses to be quenched, even by the death of its object, lie has jitst made another spiteful attack upon the military rcput i t ion of General Grant. Green-eyed envy has marked Roerrnus ior ils own, and it may be as well to let him babble on. The breath of his calumny will never stir one leaf of the laurel that adorns the tomb of the nation's deliverer. The Hulgarian government lias issued a circular letter to the great powers, ex plaining its connection with the lialkan all'air. Servia, it says, began the war, and Hulgaria was obliged to act on the de fensive in order to protect its own soil, Kven after the late armistice had been agreed upon, Servia continued her assault upon Witldin, but notwithstanding this perlidy, .Hulgaria "when victorious, ex ercised moderation at the ri-k of enabling Servia to recover her slrength." Hulgaria appparently lias the right of the matter in this dispute. Secretary .Manning's report is chielly conllned to the consideration of the silver question. Ills views are not quite so .sound as .Mr. Cleveland's on this subject, his bimetalistn project marring the other wise fair outlines of the argument. He strongly recommend j, however, the repeal of the silver coinage act. On the subject of reduction of taxes Mr. Manning is neither very clear nor very definite. He is in favor of reduction, but, as might be expected, i.s rather hazy as to the method to be pursued. The Secretary of tlio Treasury recently sent out invitations to a number of the leading manufacturers of tho country to furnish to him their views upon tarill' re vision. The general tenor of the replies seems to be against any further reduction of duties. The conclusion of one of the leading thread ina'iiil'.icturing llrms is that "any reduction of the present rate of duly on linen thread, would entail the most serious le.-ult-. upon linen thread manufacturing in the Cuited States," and the same no doubt is into in some other industries. It is related that alter Mr. Hendricks had failed of his election, in his llrst can didacy for tile vice-presidency, a Sen ator, nodding towards Mr. Wheeler, tnen in the chair of the Senate, asked the ox goNcrnor whether ho allowed himself to be envious, lie replied : "No, not envy. No place has any attraction for me where all the strain comes on the seat of the trou-ers." I'ossibly ;s imtthing like this occurred to some ot iho Senatois men tioned lor the presidency pro tern. The' presidency pro tempore, however, is n somewhat more deslr iblo position than1 tho vice-presidency, for it does not de-, prive a Senator of his right lu vote, nor I absolutely of ids right to take part in do-1 leitn Humeri, II i t 1 v i , .

The Uostcn of Monday mid, in its second page : According to tlio statements which come fiom Washington, Mr. Sherman was selected because he waved tho bloody shirt lu Ohio, and because he fought for Mahono in Virginia. Mr. Kdiniiinls is therefore fully punished, and the Repub lican party again shows in what it be lieves. Hrt tho I'a-sl was kind enough to cor net this misstatement so far as .Mr. Kd liiunds is concerned, by saying, on its llrst page : Tliero Is little doubt that Kdinuuds could have had tho Presidency pro tem pore for tlio asking, but Ids experience In the chair had taught him that there was not enough in tho ollico to repay Its occu-1 pant for what lio must give up in order to I tint nr ilm rollcdm- of i'minmi f.n- Vv perform ils duties.

What was supposed to be, upon Its dis covery, ono of the greatest boons which modern medical science had conferred ttpoti suffering Immunity, may bo made, It seems, like many other boons, as much a curse as ablessing. Cocoalne Is notonly a powerful anii'stlietlc but a virulent poi son, It possesses all tho fascination and all the deadly effects of opium. The pro fession and the public should bo warned against anything but the most sparing use of It. An eminent physician says : "Cocoalne Is sofasclnatlngadrugfor some persons with overworked nervous systems that 1 think the press is doing a good work In calling the attention of tho pub lic to the. danger of a drug witli tho ef fects of which even physicians in many cases are unacquainted." Mr. Walton suggests, In tho Watchman, that tho cases of extreme inequality in reptesentation which may come, ami in deed exist, under our system of borough representation, may be obviated by mak ing now town lines. Certainly ; and the fact that the legislature has tho power to redlstllct tho State into towns, seems to us to destroy pretty much all that there is of Hie argument fiom analogy as between tlie Vermont towns and tho States of the Union. It. would be a curious constitu tion under which tho legislature should have the power to destroy the existence and autonomy of a town by merging it in a linger one, yet could not change the rep resentation ot the town in the legislature nor permit ten thousand voters in ono town any larger representation than ten voters in another. That Is not the consti tution of Vermont, if we can understand it. lu suggesting that wi! should prefer to reserve discussion of tills subject on our part to a time nearer to that in which pro posals of amendment to tho constitution can lie made, we, of course, have had no desire to limit discussion on t lie part of others. The subject Is an important one ; and tho Fi!i:i: Pi:i:ss wi'l give some atten tion to it, in due .season. There is no doubt that the skating rinks demand very careful management, and tlie exercise of the utmost caution in ex cluding improper persons, ami in miaul ing tho morals ot the young frequenters in them. In Providence, It. I., u ii.id bu , noticed that there v.as a piKcp; .!c ii crease in the number of venrm stici walkers, who made it tla r pi hi, ire I. j promenade up and dow n the sin i Is a:.' , carry on open llirtatioiisw il h lii-t men nn. youths. In many instances t,i" pioni.-u I Jlilillir U'.'W CM ill ieil im u-i.i I i nln l!,i, i . - ing, and by girls of very tender jc.u's Assertions were m ide that the ruber 'fil ing rinks wore u-sponsible in pail tor tin bad conduct ot the girls. Pom weeks ago Mayor Doyle (leteimiiud to trace out these, and detailed ollicer.s to attend the rinks in citizen's dress and investhfa. th" matter. The worst I hat had been said about tlio existence of immoral influences was confirmed by the oillcial report ot the investigation, and n-i a consequence the aldermen will grant no mule rink licenses in Providence after the end of tiiis mouth. No doubt there are many rinks not open to such complaint; but as a general lule, especially in the large cities, they will all bear watching. It is not surprising that Gen. Logan should have declined to be shelved in the presidency pro tern of the Senate, during the impoi taut and exciting debates that are to come. It would, perhaps, have been well enough, if, like Senator Kd munds, he had announced in advance his retusal to be a candidate for the place. Hut ho probably considered their eases not quite parallel. To Mr. iMlmunds.who lias been repeatedly honored by an elec tion to the olllcc, the compliment of the caucus nomination c ould have little value, 'l'o Mr. Logan, tlio unanimous preference i of his peers, under the circumstances, lias given some distinction, though lie did not care to accept the honor thus tendered. With Kdmundsand Logan out of the Held, tlio nomination naturally and properly Tell to Mr. Sherman. Ho is an old and experienced Senator. Though heretofore not often in the chair lie must bo famil iar witli its duties; and there is no reason to doubt that lie will make a fair and com petent residing officer, lieyond that duty there is small importance in the olllcc. Ono of the Hist pieces ot business of Congress, undoubtedly, will be to pass the Hoar bill providing for the succession to tho presidency. If the very slender contingency of the deatli of i'tesident Cleveland should unfortunately occur be fore that bill becomes a law, Mr. Sherman would make an excellent I'tesident dur ing the period which must elap-e before there would bo a new election and re mote as it is, that is probably his only chance to reach the presidency, to which, as is well known, lie lias long had anxious aspirations. It is thought, also, that the presidency pin icmpun may help to make Mr. Shermnn's re-election to tlio Senate more secure. So it is all very well. Tins President's, .Message is long and somewhat diffuse; but is clear, and in spots decidedly forcible. It is but just to sav that it is In the main a strong . , ,. . .... . . .. jllm excellent, message, 'l lie no mis ot es- pecial interest in it are the discussions ot the silver question ; of tho subject of the Indians, and of tho .Mormon problem ; and iho portion lelatingtocivilservico reform. On all these .Mr. Cleveland Is square and sound, Ho sets forth most clearly tho folly and danger of further compulsory coinage of silver, and recommends the re peal of the law. lie thinks that no fixed and unyielding plan of treatment of the Indians can bo adopted. He declares that there must be no relaxation of the Kd inuuds' law against polygamy : and he in sists that t lie principle underlying the civil service law must be maintained and its saleguarils in no way weakened. It is a pity that Mr. Cleveland's acts have not nil been in accordance with his expressed hope that wo shall never return to tlio old system which distributed offices purely as io wards of nubile service. Not a few of 1.1 niitKihitiiu.iitu unr.ii fm. iiuinum mm ever, lie might have inudo more such, than ho has ; and standing as strongly as lie does by ids previous declarations in favor of the reform of tho civil service, it is to bo hoped ho will live up to them better in future. Other subjects of Interest, our readers will discovor for themselves. The Presl- dent and secretary of the navy are prob ably right In holding that there should bo a reorganization of that Important de partment prior to an effort to create a na.'y. Mr. Cleveland straddles the tmlir question, to some extent ; but thinks their should bo a reduction of duties on the necessaries ot life, which Is all right, of course, If wo are still to expect a surplus of revenue. Some of the President's fig ures do not look as if this would long bo the case.
