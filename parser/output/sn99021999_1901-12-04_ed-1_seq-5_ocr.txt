THE OMAHA DAILY BEE: WEDNESDAY, DECEMBETt 4, 1001. FIRST MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT nrid land will enrich every portion of ouri country, Just as the settlement of the Ohio nnd Mississippi valleys brought ,prosporIty to the Atlantic states. Tho Increased do rnand for manufactured articled will stlmu lato Industrial production, while wider home markets and the frado of Asia will consume tho larger food supplies and effectually pro vent western competition with east ern agriculture., Indeed, tho products of Irrigation wljl bo consumed chiefly In jjpbulldng local centers of mining nnd other Industries, which would otherwise not come Into cxlstcnco at all. Our peoplo ns a wholo will profit, for successful homo making Is but another nnmo for tho up building of tho nation. Tho necessary foundation has already been laid for the Inauguration of tho policy Just described, it would be unwtno to begin by doing too much, for n great deal will doubtless bo learned, both as to what can and what cannot bo safely nttomptcd by tho enrly efforts, which 'must of necessity bo pnrtly experimental In character. At tho very be ginning, tho government should make clear boynud shadow, of1 doubt Its Intention to pur sue this policy (in lines of tho broadest I'Ub He Interest. No reservoir or cannl should over bo. built to satisfy selfish personal or local Interests, lint only In accordance with tho advlco of trained experts, after long Investigation has shown tho locality where all tho conditions combine to mako tho work most' needed and fraught with tho greatest usefulness to the So'm'munlty as a whole. There should bo no extravaganco and tho believers In the need of lrrlgatlo will most benefit their cause by seeing to It that It'ls free from tho least taint of exces sive or reckless 'expenditure of tho public moneys. Whatever tho nation docs for the extension of Irrigation should hamonlzc with and tend to Improve the condition of those now living on Irrigated land. . We are not at the stnrt lng point of this development. Over $200, 000,000 of prfvilte capital has already been expended In tho construction of Irrigation works nnd' many million acres' of arid land reclaimed; A high degree of enter prlso and ability has been ahown In the work Itself, but as much cannot bn said In relation to the lnwa relating thereto. Tho accurltv and value of tbo homes' croated' depend largely pntho stability of titles to water, mil ino majority 01 incso resi on tho uncertain foundation of court decl V?lonn 'rendered in ordlnnry sulta at law .PJ.VHh ft few c.rcdltablo exceptions tho nrld Btsitcs'hnve failed to provldo for .the certain nnd Just division' of streams In times of scarcity. Itx and uncertain iaws ifavo mado it nosslhlo to establish rights to water In ercesH of actual' uses or necessities nnd many strenms" huvo nlrcady passed Into private ownership or control .equivalent to ownership. Whoever fcdntrols a stream practically controls tho land it renders nroductlvo nnd Ctio doctrino, ot private ownership of water Nipart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. Tho recognition of sucli ownership, which hns been per mitted to grow up( In tbo arid' regions, should gjvo vyay to a 'moro enlightened and larger recognition of tbo rlghta of "tha public In "the" control and disposal of tho pnbllo water mi0VIicb. Ia'wH founded upon conditions obtaining In humid regions, where watcf Is too abundant' to Justify hoarding it', havo no proper application. In n. dry country. in tho arid stnfeSi tho only right to water which should be; recognlzodv Is that of use. I ii Irrigation this right should attach to the lapd reojnlmed nnd bo Inseparable therefrom. (Jranflng perpetual' walcr rights t other than users, without compensation to tho public. Is open to all tho objections which apply t? glvjng away perpetual fran chises to tl'ih' jiibllc utilities of cities. A tow of tho western, states have already recognized, this and havo Incorporated In their constitutions tho doctrino of perpetual Btato nwn.0Thlp of water. Tho bcnotlls which have, followed the un aided dovoloptuop of the past justify tho nation's Bid, and. .co-operation in tho moro difficult nnd Important work yet to bo ac complished. Laws so vitally affecting homes as thoso which "control tho water supply will only Jbo cffcctlvo when they havo tho sanction .of the Irrigators j reforms can only bo final .npd 'satisfactory when they como through the enlightenment of tho poopln most concerned. Tho larger du volopmont' which nntlonal nld Insures should, howo.yer,. awaken In overy- arid Btato tho determination to. inako Its irriga tion system equal In Justice nnd effective fnesn that of 'nny country In tho civilized 7' world. 'Nothing could bo more unwlso than for Jsolntnd communities to contlnuo to learn jpvorythlng experimentally. Instead of profiting, by whnt Is already known olse Svhorc, Wo are dealing with a now nnd momentous question. In tha pregnant years while Institutions nre forming, and what wo do will affect not only1 tho present but futuro gonorntlbns. Our aim' tthduld bn not simply to reclaim tho largest' Area 'of land and provide homes 1 for thd'lnrgosf number of peoplo, but to croato for thls'nowindustry'tho best possi ble social and Industrial conditions, and this requires that Wo not only understand tbo existing situation, lint nvall ourselves of tho bes't exp'orlenco of tho tlmo In tho Bolutlon of Its prohloms. A careful study should ho made, both by tho nation and tho Htatra,iot the Irrigation laws and condi tions hefet'Alid' abroad; Ultimately It will probably bW1 noficssary for tbo nation to co-opernto With' tho several arid states In proportion as these stutes by their legisla tion nild .Administration show themselves fit to receive' It. llnivnll. In IIawnl p.ur aim must be to develop tho territory on tho traditional American linos. "VVo )o not wish a region of largo estatos tlllecl' iiy. cheap labor: wo wish n health'y American community of men who themselves Jill tbo farms they own. All our lcUlatlpu for tho Islands should bo shapea witu..iqis etui in view; ino won being ,of tho average, home-maker must nf. tnn ttin trim loaf nf tfiA Itivilttiv rinvntnn. went of tho Islands. Tbo land policy should so nearly as. possible bo modeled on our homcBtcad .bystem. , (- I'orto llleo. It Is a- pleasure to say that It Is hardly mora necessary to report' ns to Porto Hlco thau as to any Btato, or territory within our continental limits. Tho Island Is thriving as never before, and It In being admlnls tored ctllcieutly and honestly. Its people oro now enjoying liberty and order under tho proturtlon of tho United States, and upon tuufnct wo cougrntuluto thorn and oursehu. Tholr material welfare must be as l aretuliy nnd Jealously considered as the el fun 'of any other portion of our country. Wo have given them tho great V gift of . fieo inecess for tholr products to tho markets, of tbo United States, I ask ' tha attention of the congress to the need of legislation concerning tho publlo Inuds of Porto Hlco. - i Culm, In Cuba' such progress has been made toward' putting thn 'Independent govern ment of ths Island upon a Arm footing that boforo tho present session of the congress . closes this will bo un accomplished fact Cuba will thoii' start as nor own mistress and to the 'beautiful Queen of the Antilles, as elm unfolds this now pago of her dobtlny, we extend our ' heartiest greetings and good wishes. 'Elsewhere I nave discussed the question of reciprocity' Ilf the caso o Cuba, however, there arc- weighty reasons of morality and of national Interest why tho policy shoutd bo held to have a peculiar application, and 1 most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom, Indeed to thn vital need, of providing for a substantial reduction In tbo tariff duties on Cuban Imports Into tho United States. Cuba has In her constitution nfllrmed what wo do sired, that sho should stand, In Interna tional matters, In closer and moro friendly relations with us than with any other power, nnd wo are bound by overy consider ation of honor and expediency to pass com mercial measures In the Intorost of her material well-being. The Philippine. In tbo Philippines our problem Is larger. They aro very rich tropical Islands, In habited by many varying tribes, represent ing widely different stages of progress to ward civilization. Our earnest effort Is to holp theso peoplo upward along tho stony nnd difficult path that tends to solf-govcrn- ment. Wo hopo to mako our administration of tho Islands honorablo to our nation by making It of the highest benefit to tho Filipinos themsolves, nnd, as an earnest of what wo Intend to do, we point to what wo havo done. Already a greater measttro of material prosperity nnd of governmental honesty nnd efficiency has been attained In tho Philippines than cvor beforo In their history. It Is no light task for a nation to achlove tho temperamental qualities without which tho Institutions of free government are but nn empty mockery. Our peoplo aro now successfully governing themselves, bocause for more than a thousand years thoy havo been slowly fitting themselves, somctlmos consciously, sometimes unconsciously, to ward this end. What has taken us thirty gen erntlons to nchlevo wo cannot expect to see another raco accomplish out of hand, rspo dally when largo portions of that raco start very far behind tho point which our an cestors had reached oven thirty generations ago. In dealing with the Pblllpptno people wo must show both pntlenco and strength, forbearance and steadfast resolution. Our aim Is high. Wo do not deslro to do for tho Islanders morely what has clsowhere been dono for tropic peoples by even the best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what has never beroro been aone for any peoplo of tho tropics to mako them fit for solf-governmcnt nftcr the fash- Ion of tbo really free nations. History may safely bo challenged to show n slnglo Instnnco In which n masterful rriqn such as ours, having been forced by th( exigencies of war to take possession of nn alien In ml, has behaved to Its Inhabitants with tho disinterested zeal for tholr prog res that our peoplo havo .Bhowu In tbo Philippines. To lcavo tho .Islands nt this tlmo would mean that they would fall lnn a welter of murderous anarchy. Such de sertion of duty on our part would bo a crlmo against humanity. The character of (lovcrnor Taft and of his associates and subordinates .Is a proof, If nuch be needed, of tho sincerity of our effort to give thn J neutrnl -use by nil nations on terms of Islandors a constantly Increasing measure ( equality without the guaranty or Intcrfor of self-government, exactly as fast us thoy onco of any OUHtdo nation from any quar show thomsolves fit to exercise. It. Since t(,r Thp BRne,i treaty will at once bo laid tho civil government was cstamuncd not an appointment has been made In the Islands with any roferenco to considerations of political Influence, or to aught else savo the fitness of-the man and tho needs of tho service. In our nnxlcty for the welfare ami prog ress of tho Philippines It may bo that hero and thcro wo have gone too rapidly In giving them local self-government. It Is on this side that ourfnrror, If , any, has been committed. No competent observer, slncorcly desirous of finding out the facts and Influenced only by a deslro for tho wel fare of the natives, can assert that wo have not gono far enough. Wo havo gone to tho very vergo of safety In hastening the process. To havo taken a single step farther or faster In advance would havo been folly nnd w-cakness, and might well havo been crime. We are oxtremoly anx ious that tbo natives shall show tho power of governing themselves. Wo aro nnxtous, first for tholr snkes. nnd next, becnuno It relieve ns of a great burden. Thcro need not bo tho slightest fear of our not con tinuing to glvo them all the liberty for which thoy are fit. Tho only fear Is lest In our over-nnxlcty wo glvo them n degrco of Independence for which thoy nre unfit, thoreby Inviting re action nnd disaster. As fnst ns thero Is any reasonablo hops that In a given district tho people can govern themselves, self- government has been given In that district. Thero is not n locality fitted for self-gov ernment which has not received It. nut It Jm ay woll bo that In certain cases It will havo to bo withdrawn becauso tho Inhabi tants show themsolves unfit, to oxorclsu it; surh Instances have already occurred, in other words, thoro Is not the slightest chance of our falling to show a sufficiently humanitarian spirit. Tho danger .comes In the opposite direction. Stilt Trouble Alirnil. Thcro nro still troubles ahead In the Isl ands. Tho Insurrection has becomo an af fair of local banditti and maraudeni, who deservo no higher regard than tho brigands of portions of tho old world. Encourago ment, direct or indirect, to theso insur- rectos stands .on the same footing as en couragement to hostile Indians In tho days when wo still had Indian wars. Exactly as our aim Is to give to tho Indian who re mains peaceful tho fullest and amplest con sideration, but to havo It understood that wo will show no weakness it ho goes on tho warpath, so wo must mnko It evident, unless wo nro falso to our own traditions and to tho demands of civilization and hu manity, that while wo will do everything in our power for tho Filipino who Is peace ful, wo will take tho stornost measures with tho Filipino who follows tbo path of the Insurrecto nnd tho ladrone. Tho heartiest prnlso Is due to largo num bers of tho natives of thn Islands for tholr steadfast loyalty. Tho Macabebes havo been conspicuous for tholr codrago nnd devotion to tbo flag. I recommend that tho secretary of war bo empowered to take homo syste matic action In tho way of aiding thoso of these men who aro crippled In the service and the families of thoso who nro killed. A iltll ( lit it III Iif-iclsIitHon Xeeileil, Tho time has como when thcro should bo additional legislation for thn Philip pines. Nothing bettor can bo done, for the Islands thau to lntroduco Industrial enter prises. Nothing would benefit them so much as throwing them open to industrial 'development. Tho connection between Idle ness and mischief Is proverbial, and the opportunity to do remunerative work is one nf thn surest preventives of war. Of coursa no business man will go Into tbo Philip pines unless It Is to his Interest to do so, and It Is Immensely to tho Interest of the Islands that ho should go In. It Is there to ro necessary that tha congrees should pass laws by which tho resources of the Islands can bo doveloped, so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can bo granted to companies doing busluoss In them, and every encouragement bo given to tho In coming of business men of every kind. Not to permit this Is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchises must be granted and tho business permitted only under regulation which will guarantee the Islands against auy kind of Improper ex. ptoltatton. lint tho vast natural wealth of the Islands must bo developed aud the capl tal willing to develop It must bo given the opportunity. The field must be thrown open to Individual enterprise, which has beeu the real faotor In tho development of every region over which our flag has flown, It Is urgently necessary to enact sultabte laws dealing with general transportation, min ing, banking, currency, homesteads and the use and ownership of tho lands and timber. These laws will give freo play to industrial enterprise, and tho commercial develop ment which will surely follow will afford to tho pooplo of tho Islands the best proofs of tho sincerity of our desire to nld them. I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawalt and tho Philippines, to be continued from tho Philippines to points in Asia. Wo should not defer a day longer than necessary tho construction of such n cable. It Is demanded not merely for commercial but for political and military considerations. I net fir! Cnbte, Either the congress should immediately provide for tho construction of a govern ment cablo or else an arrangement should be mado by which like advantages to thoso accruing from a government cable may bo secured to thn government by contract wlthj a private cablo company. Isthmlnn Cnnnl. No slnglo great material work which re mains to bo undertaken on this continent Is of such consequonce to tho American people ns tbo building of n canal across the Isth mus connecting North and South America. Its Importance to tho nation Is by no means limited merely to Its material offects upon our business prosperity, and yet with view to those effects alono It would bo to tho last degree Important for us Immedi ately to begin It. Whllo Its beneficial ef fects would perhaps bo most marked upon the Pacific coast and tbo gulf and south Atlantic states, It would also greatly benefit other sections. It Is emphatically n work which It Is for the Interest of the entlro country to begin nnd complete ns soon as possible; It Is one of those great works which only n grcnt nation can undertake with prospects of success, and which when dono nre not only permanent assets In tho nation's material Interests, but standing monuments to Its constructive ability. Cnnnl Trent jr. I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this subject with Great llrltaln, conducted on both sides in a spirit of friendliness nnd mutual good will and renpect, have resulted In ray being nblo to lay before tho senate a treaty wblc'.t If ratified will cnnblc us to begin prepara tions for an Isthmian canal at any time and which guarantees to this nation every right that It has ever asked In connection with the canal. In this treaty, tho old Claytou-Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as Inadequate to supply the baso for tho construction nnd maintenance of a neces sarily American ship cannl. Is abrogated. It specifically provides that the United States alono shall do the work of building and nBsume tuu responsibility of safe guarding the cannl nnd shall rcgulato Its beforo tho senate, and if approved tho con- gress can then proceed to glvo effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for tho building of the canal. Pence Conference. Tho true end of every great and free peo pie should be self-respecting peace, and this nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordial friendship with all others. Over tho entlro world, of recent years, wars be t'een" tlio great civilized powers havo be como less and less frequent. Wars with barbarous or semi-barbarous peoples come In an entirely different category, being morely a most regrettable but necessary International pr ice duty which must be performed for tho sake of tho welfare of mankind. Peaco can only be kept with cer tainty whero both sides wish to keep It, but more and moro the civilized peoples aro realizing tho wicked folly of war and are attaining that condition of Just and Intelli gent regard for tbo 'rights of others which will In the end, ns we hopo and believe, make world-wldo peace possible. Tho poace conferonco at Tho Hague gave definite ex pression to this hopo and belief and marked a stride toward their attainment. This same peaco conferonce acquiesced In our statement of tho Monroe doctrine as compatible with tho purposes nnd alms of the conferonce. Monroe Doctrine. Thi Monroo doctrine should be tho car- llnal featuro nf the foreign policy of all tha nations of tho two Americas, ns It la of the United Status. Just soventy-olght years havo passed slnco President Monroo In his annual message announced that "Tho Amer ican continents are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for futuro coloniza tion by any European power." In other words, the Monroo doctrino Is a declaration that thero must be no territorial aggran dizement by, any non-American power nt tho expenso of any American power on Ameri can soil. It is In no wise intended as hos tile to any nation In the old world. Stilt less Is It Intended to give cover to any aggression by ono new world power at thn expenso of any other. It Is simply u step, and a long etcp, toward assuring tno uni versal peaco of the world by securing the possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere. During tho past century other Influences havo established tho permanenoo and Inde pendence of tho smaller states of Europe. Through the Monroo doctrine wo hope to bo nblo to safeguard like independence and sccuro like permanence for the lesser among the new world nations. This doctrino has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any American power, save that It In truth allows each of them to form uch as It desires. In other words, it Is really a 'guaranty of the com mercial Independence of thn Americas. Wo do not ask under this doctrine for any ex cluslvo commercial dealings with any other American state. We do not guarantoe any state against punishment If It misconducts Itself, provided that punishment does not take tho form of the acquisition of terri tory by any non-American power. Our attltudo In Cuba Is a sufficient guar anty of our own good faith. Wo havo not tho slightest deslro to secure any territory at the expenso of nny of our neighbors. Wo wish to work with them hand Inihand, so that all of us may be uplifted together, and wo rejoice over the good fortune of any of them, wo gladly hall their material prosperity and political stability, and are concerned and alarmed If any of them fall into industrial or political chaos. Wo do not wish to eee nny old world military power grow up on this continent, or to be compelled to becomo a military power our selves. Tho peoples of the Americas can prosper best If left to work out their own salvation In their own way. Unliulldlnar at .vy. The work of upbuilding the navy must be steadily continued. No ono point of our 1 1 i a . i i . . i , fumy, iuiuiku ui uuiui'Qkiu, in luuru lul portant thau this to the honor and material welfare, and above all to the peace, of olir nation In the futuro. Whether we desire It or not, wo must henceforth recognize thai we have International duties no less than International rights. Even If our flag were hauled down In thr Philippines and Porto Hlco, even If wo decided not to build the isthmian canal, we should need a thor oughly trained navy of adequate size, or else be prepared definitely and for all time to abandon tho Idea that our nation Is among thoso whose sons go down to the sea In ships. Unless our commerce is al ways to be carried in forolgn bottoms, we must have war craft to protect It. Inasmuch, however, as tho American peo ple have no thought of abandoning tbo path upon which they havo entered, nnd espe cially In view of the fact that the building of the isthmian canal Is fast becoming ono of tho matters which the wholo peoplo are united In demanding, it Is Imperative that our navy should be put and kopt In the highest state of efficiency, and should be made to answer to our growing needs. So far from being In any way a provocation to war, an adequate and highly trained navy Is tho best guaranty against war, tho cheapest and most effective peace Insur ance. Tho cost of building and maintaining such ft navy represents tho very lightest premium for Insuring peace which this na tion can possibly pay. Probably no other groat nation In the world Is so anxious for peace os we are. Thero is not a single civilized power which ban nnythlng whatever to fear from ag gressiveness on our part. All wo want Is peace, and toward this end we wish to bo ablo to securo tho same respect for our rights from others which we are eager and anxious to extend to tholr rights In return, to lnsuro fnlr treatment to us commercially and to guarantee tho safety of the Ameri can people. Our people Intend to abide by the Monroe doctrino and to Insist upon it as the one sure means of securing the peace of the western hemisphere. The navy offers us the only means of mnklng our insistence upon tho Monroe doctrino anything but a subject of derision to whatever nation chooses to disregard It. Wo desire the peaco which comes as of right to tho Just man armed; not the peace granted on terras of Ignominy to the craven and the weakling. It Is not posslblo to Improvise a nav after war breaks out. The ships must be built and the men trained long In advance. Somo auxiliary vessels can be turned Into raakeohlfts which will do In default of any better for the minor work, and a propor tion of raw men can bo mixed with the highly trained, their shortcomings being made good by the skill of their fellows; but tho efficient lighting force of tho navy when pitted against an equal opponent will be found almost exclusively In tho war ships that have been regularly built and In the officers and men who through years of faithful performance of sea duty havo been trained to handle their formidable but com plex and dellcato weapons with the highest efficiency. In the late war with Spain tho ships that dealt the decisive blows at Ma nila and Santiago had been launched from two to fourteen years and they were able to do as they did becauso the men In tho conning towers, tho gun turrets and the engine rooms had through long years of practice at sea learned how to do their duty. Our present navy was begun In 1882. At that period our navy consisted of a collec tion of antiquated wooden ships, already almost ns out of place against modern war vesncls as the galleys of Alclblades and Hamllcar certainly ns the ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at that tlmo did wo have men tit to handle a modern man-of-war. Under the wise legislation of tho congress and the successful administration of a suc cession of patriotic secretaries of the navy, belonging to,both political parties, the work of upbuilding the navy wont on nnd ships equal to nny In tho world of tholr kind were continually added, and what was oven mote Important, these ships were exercised at sea singly and In squadrons until the mon aboard them wero able to get tho best possible service out of them. The result was seen In the short war with Spain, which was decided with such rapidity be causo of tho Infinitely greater preparedness of our navy than of the Spanish navy. Whllo awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded nnd manned tho ships which destroyed tho Spanish sea forces In tho Philippines and In Cuba, we must not forget that an equal meed of praise belongs to those without, whom neither blow could have beon struck. The congressmen who voted years In advance tho money to lay down the ships, to build the guns, to buy the armorplate; the de partment officials and the business mon and wage workers who furnished what the con gress had authorized; the secretaries of thn navy who asked for and expended the ap propriations, and finally the officers who, In fair weather nnd foul, on actual sea service. trained and disciplined tho crows of tho ships when thero was no war In sight all are entitled to a full share In the glory of Manila und Santiago, and tho respect ac corded by every true American to those who wrought such signal triumph for our coun try. It was forethought nnd preparation which secured us tho overwhelming tri umph of 18981 It we fall to show fore thought and preparation now, thero may come n time when disaster will befall us Instead of triumph, and should this time come, tho fault will rest primarily, not upon those whom the accldont of events puts In supremo command at the moment, but upon thoso who have failed to prepare in advance There should bo no cessation In the work of completing our navy. So far Ingenuity has been wholly unable to devise a sub stituto for the great war craft whoso ham mering guns beat out tho mastery of the high seas. It Is unsafe and unwise not to provldo this year for several additional battle ships and heavy armored cruiser, with auxiliary and lighter craft in propor tion; for tho exact numbers and character I rofer you to the report of thp secretary of the navy. Cut thero Is something w need even moro than additional ships, and this Is additional officers and men. To pro vide battleships nnd cruisers and then lay them up, with the expectation of leaving them unmanned until tbey aro needed in actual war, would "Do worse than folly; it would be a crime against the nation. To send any war ship against a compe tent enemy unless those aboard It have been trained by years of actual sea service, Including Incessant gunnery practice, would bo to Invite not merely disaster, but tlto bitterest shamo and humiliation. Four thousand additional seamen and 1,000 addl tlonal marines Bhould bo provided, and an Increase In tho officers should be provided by making a largo addition to the classes at Annapolis. There Is one small matter which should be mentioned In connection with Annapolis. Tho pretentious and un meaning title of "naval cadot" should be abolished; tho title of "midshipman," full of historic association, should be restored. Even In time of peace a war ship should be used until it wears out, for only so can It bo kept lit to respond to auy emergency. Tbo ofrlcors and men alike should be kept on much ns possible on blue water, for it Is thcro only thoy can learn their duties as they should be learned. The big vessels should be maneuvered In squadrons con talnlng not merely battleships, bdt the neccseary proportion of cruisers and scouts. Tho torpedo boats should be handled b tho younger officers In such manner as will best lit the latter to take responsibility and meet the emergencies of actual warfare. Every detail ashore which can be per formed by a civilian should be ho par formed, the officer being kept for his special duty in tho sea service, Abovo all, gunnery practice- should be unceasing. It Is Im portant to have our navy of adequate size, hut It Is eveu more Important that ship for ship It ehould equal In efficiency any navy In the world, This is possible only with highly drilled crews and officers, and this In turn Imperatively domnnds continuous and progressive Instruction In target prac tice, ship handling, squadron tactics and general discipline. Our ships must bo as sembled In squadrons actively cruising away from harbors and novcr long at anchor. The resulting wenr upon engines and hulls must bo endured; a battleship worn out In long training of officers and mon Is well paid for by the results, while, on tho other hand, no matter in how excel lent condition, it Is useless It tbo crew bo not expert. Wo now have seventeen battleships ap propriated for, of which nlno nro com pleted and have been commissioned for ac tual service The remaining eight will bo roady In from two to four years, but it will tako at least that tlmo to recruit and train tho men to fight them. It Is of vast con cern that wo havo trained crows ready for the vessels by the tlmo they nre commis sioned. Oood ships nnd good guns are sim ply good weapons, and the best weapons nro useless cave In the hands of men who know how to fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled under n thor ough and well-planned system of progres sive Instruction, whllo the recruiting must bo carried on with still greater vigor. Every effort must bo mado to exalt tbo main function of the officer the command of! men. The leading graduates ot tho Naval academy should be assigned to tho combatant bronchos, the lino and marines. Many of the essentials of success nro al ready recognized by tho general board, which, as tho central offlco ot a growing taff, Is moving steadily toward a proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency of the whole navy, under tho secretary. This general board, by fostering tho creation ot a general staff. Is providing for tho official and then tho general recognition of our altered conditions as a nation and ot tho true meaning of a great war floet, which meaning Is, first, the best men, and, second, the best chips. Nntlnnnl .Vnvat nenerre. The naval mllltla forces are state organi zations, and are trained for coast service, aud in event of war they will constitute tho Inner line of defense, They should re ceive hearty encouragement from tho gen eral government. But In addition wo should at once pro vide for a national naval reserve, organized and trained under tha direction of tho Navy department, and nubject to the call of the chief executive whenever war be comes Imminent. It should be a real aux iliary to the naval seagoing peace estab lishment, and offer material to be drawn on at onco for manning our ships In time of war. It should bo composed of graduates of tho Naval academy, graduates of the naval mllltla, officers and crews of coast line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing vessels and steam yachts, together with tho coast population about such centers as life saving stations and lighthouses. The American peoplo must cither build and maintain an adequate navy or else make up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position In International 'affairs, not merely In political, but In commercial matters. It has been well said that thero l no surer way of courting national dis aster than to be "opulent, aggressive and unarmed." Army I.nrare Ennngh. It Is .not necessary to Increase our army beyond its present size at this tlmo. But It Is necessary to keep It at tho highest point ot efficiency. The individual units who, as officers and enlisted men, compose thjs army, are, we have good reason to be lieve, at least as efficient as those ot any other army In the entire world. It Is our duty to see that their training Is of a kind to Insure the highest possible ex pression ot power to these units when act ing In combination. The conditions' of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavier demand than ever befors upon tho individual char acter and capacity of the officer and tho enlisted man, and to make it far moro difficult for men to act togothor with effect. At present the fighting must bo dono In extendod order, which means tbnt each man must act for himself and at the namo time act In combination with others with whom he is no longer In tho old-fashioned elbow- to-elbow touch. Under such conditions a few men of the highest excellence aro worth more than many men without tho special skill which Is only found as the result of special training applied to men of exceptional physlquo and morale. But nowadays the most valuable fighting mnn and the most difficult to perfect Is tho rifleman who Is also a skillful and dnrlng rider. The proportion nf our cavalry regiments has wisely been increased. The American cavalryman, trained to maneuver and fight with equal facility on foot and on horse back, Is tho best type ot soldier for gen eral purposes now to be found In tho world. The Ideal cavalryman of the present day Is a man who can fight on foot as effectively as the best Infantryman, and who Is in ad dition unsurpassed In thtt care and man agement of his horso and In his ability to fight on horsohack. A general staff should be created. As for the present staff and supply depart ments, they should be filled by details from tho lino, thn men so detailed return ing after awhllo to their line duties. It Is very undesirable to havo the senior grades of the array composed of men who have como to fill tho positions by tho mero fact of seniority, A system should bo adopted by which there shall be an elimination, grade by grade, of thoso who seem unfit to render tho best service in the next grade. Justice to tbo veterans of tho civil war who are still in the army would seem to re quire that in the matter of retlroments they be given by law tbo same privileges accorded to their comrades In tho navy. Tho process of elimination of the least fit should be conducted In a manner that would -render it practically impossible to apply political or social pressure on be half ot any candidate, so that each man may be Judged purely on his own merits. Prcasure for tbo promotion of civil officials for political reasons is bad enough, but it Is tenfold worse whero applied on behalf ot officers of the army and navy. Every pro- lnotion and overy detail under tho War de partment must be made aololy with regard to the good of the service and to the ca paclty and merit of the man himself. No pressure, political, social or personal, ot any kind, will be permitted to exercise the least effect In any question ot promotion or detail, and If there U reason to believe that such pressure Is exercised at the insti gation of the officer concerned, it will bo held to militate against him. In our army we cannot afford to havo rewards or duties distributed, save on tho nlmplo ground that those who by their own merits are entitled to the rewards got them, and that those who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to perform them. Every effort should be made to bring the army to a constantly Increasing state of efficiency. When on actual service no work save that directly in the line of such serv ice ehould be required. The paper work In the army, as In the uavy, should bo greatly reduced. What Is needed Is proved power of command and capacity to work well In the field. Constant raro Is neces sary to prevent dry rot lu the transporta tion and commissary departments. Our army is it small and so much scat tered that It Is very dlfllcult to glvo tho higher officers (as well ns tho lower officers and tho enlisted men) n chance to practice maneuvers in mass nnd on n comparatively largo scale. In tlmo ot need no amount of individual cxccllcnco would nvall against tho parnlysls which would follow Innblltty to work ns n coheront whole, under skillful nud daring leadership. The congress should provldo means whereby It Will bo possible to havo Held exercises by nt least a division ot regulars, and It possible also a division of national guardsmen, onco n year. Theso exercises might tnko tho form of field maneuvers; or, If on tho gulf coast or the Pacific or Atlantic seaboard, or In tho region ol tho Great Lakes, tho army corps whon assembled could bo marched from eorao inland point to somo point on the water, thcro embarked, disembarked nttor n couplo of days' Journoy at some other point, nnd again marched Inland. Only by actual handling and providing tor men In masses whllo they nro marching, camp ing, embarking nnd disembarking, will it bo posslblo to trnln tho higher officers to perforin their duties woll and smoothly. A grent dobt Is owing from thn public to tho men of tho nrmy nndt nnvy. They should bo ho treated nn to enable them to reach tho highest point of efficiency, so that they may bo ablo to respond Instantly to any demand mado upon tbem to sustain tho Interests of tbo nation and tho honor of tho flag. Thn Individual American en listed man In probably on thn whole a moro formidable fighting man than tho regular of nny othor nrmy. Every consideration should bo shown htm, and In return tho highest Standard of usefulness should bo exacted from him, It Is woll worth whllo' for tho congress to consldor whether tho pay of enlisted men upon second nnd Bub sequent enlistments should not be Increased to correspond with the Increased value ot tho veteran Soldier. Much good has already como from tbo act reorganizing tho urmy, passed early In tho present year. The thrco prlmo reforms, nil of them of literally Incstlmablo value, nro, first, the substitution of four-yenr dctnlls from the lino for pormancht appointments In tho so-called staff divisions; second, tho establishment of a corps of artillery with a chlot at tho head! third, the establish ment of a maximum and minimum limit for tbo nrmy. It would bo dlfllcult to over estimate tho Improvement In tho efficiency of our army which theso thrco reforms aro making, and have In part already effected. Tho reorganization provided for by tho act has becu substantially accomplished. Tho Improved conditions In tho Philippines havo enabled tho War department ma- terlally to rcduco the military charge upon our revenue and to arrange the number ot soldiers go as to bring this number much nearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit established by law. Tbero is, however, need of supplementary legisla tion. Thorough military education must bo provided, nnd In addition to tho regulars tho advantages of this education should bo given to tho officers ot tho national guard and others In civil llfo who desire Intelli gently to fit themselves for posslblo mili tary duty. Tho officers should bo given tbo chance to perfect themselves by study In tho higher branches of this art. At West Point the education should bo of the kind most apt to turn out men who nro good In actual field service; too much BtresB should not be Inld on mathematics, nor Bhould pro Sclcncy therein bo held to establish tho right of entry to a corps d'olltc. Tho typical American officer of the best kind need not bo n good mathematician; but ho must be able to master himself, to control others, and to show boldness nnd fertility ot resource In every emergency. Mllltln nnd Volunteer. Action should be tnken In reference to tho mllltla and to tho raising ot volunteer forces. Our mllltla law is obsolete and worthless. The organization and nrma ment of thn national guard ot tho several states, which are treated as mllltla In the appropriations by tho congress, should bo mado identical with thoso provided for the regular forces. Tho obligations and duties of tho guard In tlmo of war should bo caro- fully defined, nnd n system established by law under which tho method of proccduro of raising volunteer forces should bo pro scribed In advance. It, Is utterly lmposslblo In tho excitement 'and haste of Impending war to do this satisfactorily If tho arrange ments havo not been mado long beforehand. Provision should bo mado for utilizing In the first volunteer organizations called out the training of theso citizens who havo already had experience under arms, and especially for tho selection In advnnco of the officers ot nny forco which mny bo raised; tor careful selection of tho kind necessary Is Impossible after tbo outbreak of war. That tho nrmy Is not at all a more instru ment of destruction has been shown during the last threo years. In tho Philippines, Cuba and Porto Illco it has proved itself a great constructive force, n most potent Implement for tthe upbuilding ot a peace ful civilization. No other citizens deserve so welt ot the republlo as the veterans, the survivors of those who saved the union. They did the one deed which if left undono would havo meant that alt elso In our history went for nothing. But for their steadfast prowess In the greatest crisis ot our history all our annals would be meaningless and our great experiment In popular freedom nnd Belt government a gloomy failure. Moreover, thoy not only left us a united nation, but they left us also ns a horltage tho memory of tho mighty deeds by which tho nation was kept united.

Tho men who In tho last threo years hav dono bo well In tho East nnd West Indies and on tho mainland of Asia havo shown, that this remcmbrnnco la not lost. In nny serious crisis the United States must rely for tho great mass of Us fighting men upon tho volunteer soldiery who do not mako ft pormanent profession of tho mllltnry caroer, and whenever such n crisis arises tho death less moratrlcs of tho civil war will glvo to Americans the lift of lofty purpose which comes to thoso whoso fathers have stood valiantly in tho forefront of tho battle. Tho merit system of making appointment Is In its csrenco ns democratic and American as tho common school system ttself. It simply means thnt In clerlcul nnd othor positions, whore tho duties nre entirely non political, nil applicants Bhould havo n fntr Held nnd no favor, each standing on hit merits ns ho Is nble to show them by prno tlcal test. Written compotltlvo examina tions offer tho only nvnllablo means in many cases for applying this systom. In othor cases, as whore iabnrors nro employed, n syntcm ot registration undoubtedly can h widely extended. Thero nre, of course. places whoro thn written compotltlvo ex amination cannot bn npplled nnd others: whero it offers by no means an ldenl solu tion, but where undor existing political conditions It Is, though nn imperfect mean, yet the bent present means ot getting satti factory results. Atlvocntrn Merit System. Whcrovcr tho conditions hnvo permitted tho application ot tho merit system in its fullest nnd widest sonso the gain to tha government hss been immense. Tho navy yards and postal service Illustrate, prohabl hotter than any othor branches of tho gov ernment, tho great gain In economy, efficiency nnd honesty duo to tho enforce ment of this principle. 1 recommend tho passago of n law which will extend the classified service to tha District of Columbia, or will at least enabls the president thus to extend It. In my Judgment all laws providing for tho tempo rary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision tbnt thoy bo selcctod under tho civil service law. It Is Important to havo thin system obtain nt home, but It In even morn Important ta havo It applied rigidly In our Insular pos sessions. Not an office should bo filled In tho Philippines or Porto ltlco with any regard to tho man's partisan nffillatlons op scrvlors, with any regnrd to tho political, social or personal Inlluenco which ho may havo at his command: In short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing snvo tho man's own character aud capacity nnd tbo needs of tho Bervlco. Tho administration of theso Islands should bo ns wholly freo from tho suspicion ot partlsnn politics ns tho administration, ot tho army nnd navy. All that wo ask from tho public servant In the Philippines or Porto Hlco Is that ho reflect honor on his country by tho way In which ho makes that country's rtllo a benefit to tho peoples who hnvo como under It. This Is nil that wo should ask and we cannot afford to bn content with lees. The merit nystcm Is simply ono method of securing honest and efficient administra tion of tho government, and In tho long run the sole Justification of nny type of govern ment lien In lte proving Itself both honest and efficient. CoiiMulnr Service. The consular scrvlco is now organized undor tho provisions of a law passed In, 1856, which Is entirely inadequato to exist ing conditions. The Interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout tha country in tho reorganization of tho scrvlco Is hcarlly commended to your attention. Sovcrai bills providing for n new consular scrvlco have In recent yoars been sub mitted to tho congress. Thoy are based upon the just prlnclplo thnt appointment to tho nervlco should bo mado only after n practical test of tbo applicant's fitness, thnt promotions should bo govorned by trustworthiness, adaptability nnd zeal In tho porformanco of duty nnd that tho ten ure ot office should bo unaffected by partl- san considerations. Tho guardianship nnd fostering of our rapidly expanding foreign commerce, the protection of Amorlcnn cltlznns resorting; to foreign countries In lawful pursuit of tholr affairs and tho maintenanco of th dignity ot tho nation abroad combine ta make It essential that our consuls should bo mon of charactor, knowlcdgo and enter prise It Is truo that tho norvlco Is now, In tho main, efficient, but a htundard of ex cellence cannot ho permanently maintained until tbo principles set forth in tho bills horctoforo submitted to the congress oa thin bubject are enacted into law, I.o, the Poor t ml Inn. In my judgment thn tlmo has arrived when wo should definitely mako up our minds to recognize tho Indian as an In dividual nnd not an a member of n tribe. The general allotmont.net is u mighty pul verizing engine to break tip thn tribal mass. It acts directly upon tho family an4 tho Individual. Under ItH provisions nomn 60,000 Indians have, nlready bocomn citizen or the Unltod Statos.
