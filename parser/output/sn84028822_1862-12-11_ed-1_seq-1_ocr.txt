FOREIGN RELATIONS. Tlio correspondence touching foreign nfi'airs, wbicli has taken placo during lliu past yenr, is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with n request to that effect mndo by tho Homo of tRcpresentntivcs nonr tho closo of tho past session of Con jjress. If tho condition of our relations villi other tinlions is less grnlifying than it hns usually been at former period?, it is certainly moio satisfactory than n nation so unhappily distrnetod ns wo nio, might reas onably hnvo apprehended. In the month of Juno last thero wero somo grounds to expect that tho marnlime powers, which at tho beginning of our domestic dillictiliiea so unwisely and unncccsiarily, as wo think, iccognized tho insurgents ns belligerents, would toon rccedo from that position, which has proved only less injurious to thcmsolves than to our own country. Hut the temporary reverses which afterward befel tho national atm, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, hnvo hitherto delayed that act of simplo justice. Tho civil war which has so radically changed for tho moment tho occupations and habits of tho American people, has necessarily disturbed the social conditions nnd piTcctod very deeply tho prosperity of tho nations with which wo have cm lied on ncommcrco thnt hns been steadily increas ing throughout a period of half a century. It has nt the snmo timo excited political ambitions and apprehensions which hnvo produced a piofound agitation throughout tho civilized woifd. In this unusual agita tion wo hava forboma from taking part in any controversy between foreign Slates, and between parties nnd factions or any such Stales. Wo have attempted no propngandism nnd acknowledged no tcvo Jution, but wo hnvo left to every nation tho exclusive conduct and management of its own nfiairs. Our strucglo has been, of course, contemplated by loroign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed nnd often exaggerated c(Tcts and consequence-? resulting to thoio nations themselves. Novel tlndess, com plaint on the part of this Government, even if it wore just, would certainly be unwise. AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. Tho trenly with Groat Uritain fir tho (suppression of tho slavo trndo hns been put into operation, with a good prospect of complelo succe.'s. It is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that tho execution of it on llio part of Ilai Maieslv's Government has been marked with n jealous respect for tho authority of tho United Stales nnd tho rights of ihcir moral and loyal citizens. Tho Convention with Hanover for the abolition of tho slade dues has been car tied into full filled under tho act of Con gress for that purpose. THE BLOCKADE. A blockade of 3,000 miles of sen coast could not bo established nnd vigorously inforced in a season of great commeicial activity like the present, without commit ting occasional mistakes and inflicting un intentional injuries upon foreign nations nnd their subjects. A civil wnr occurring in a country whero foreigners resido nnd carry on trade under treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of complaints of tho violation of noutrnl rights. All such col lisions tend to excite misapprehensions nnd possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations which havo n common interest in preserving peaco and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have, so far as possible, heard and redressed complaints which have boon presented by fiiendly pow crr. Ttoere is still, however, a largo and an nucmiontinir number of doubtful cases upon which ihe Government is unable to Agree with tho Governments whose protection is demanded by tho claimants. Thero are, moreover, many cases in which the United States or their citizens suffer wrongs fiom tho naval or military authorities of foreign nntions which tho Governments of thoso States are not nl onco prepared to redress, I havo proposed to somo of tho foreign Stntes thus interested mutual conventions, to exnmino and adjust such complaints. This proposition hns been made especially to flrent Britnin, to France, to Spain and Piussia. In each caso it hns bsen kindly received, but hns not yet been formnlly adopted. I deem it my duty to recommend nn np propriation in behalf of tho owners of tlio Norwegian baik Admiral Toidenskiold, which vessel was. in Mny, 1801, prevontid by tho Commander of tho blockading fotco oil Ulinrlesloli, irom leaving .uni pun mi cargo, notwithstanding n similar piivilego had shortly before been granted to nn En dish vessel. I havo directed ll o Sec retary of State to cause the pipers in tho caso to bo communicated to tlio proper committees. NEGRO COLONIZATION. Annlicalions havo been mado to mo by many frco Americans of.African doscor.l, to favor their cmiuration with a vhw to such colonization as wns contemplated in ric-nt nets of Congress. Other parties nl homo nnd nbroad,soino from inteiestod motives, . others upon patriotic considerations, nnd s'ill others influenced by philanthropic sen timents, have 6U2cested timilnr measures: while on the other hand, several of tho Spanish American republics hnvo protested nainst the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under theso circumstances I havo decliued to niovo any such colony to nuy Stnto, without first ob taining'tha consent of its Government, nnd with nn agrcomonl on its part to receive nnd protect such emigrants in nil their rights si fieomon. 1 have nt tho same timo offered to several Stnlas situated in the tropics, or having colonies there, to ne gotiate with them, subject to the advice nnd consent of the Seunt, to favor M)e j'hiiii mnn 1 1 T ff r.f --T- voluntary otniuralion of parsons of. tnai . . - ...i clnss to their respective territories, upon conditions which shall bo equal, just and humane. Liberia and liny It nre, as yol, the only countries lo which colonists of African da- scent from hero could go with ceitnintyof being received nnd adopted na citizens, and 1 regret lo say that such persona contem plating colonization, do not oem so willing to migrate to thoio countries as to somo others, nor o willing as 1 think their in terest demands. I believe, howover, opin ion nmong lliom, in this respect, is improv ing, and that erelong thoro will bo nn aug mented and considerable migration to both these countrios from tho United Slate. The now commercial treaty botween tho United Stntes nnd tho Sullnn of Turkey, has boon carried into execution. A com Inuicinl nnd consular treatv has beeen no- ! Gotiated, subject to llio Sennto's consent, t . . . . J . . I witlr Jjilictia, and n smillnr tiPi'otinlion is now pending witlr tho llupublic of Hnyli. i consuleialili) improvement of I he not lonnl commoico is expected to result from thesa inensurcs. Our telnlions with Great Dritnin, Fiance, S)ain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Dun- mntk, bweilen and Austria, llio rselhcr lands, Italy, Rome nnd tho other European States, remain undisturbed. Very favor ablo relations also continue (o bo main tained with Tuikov, Morocco, China and Japan. During the last yenr thero hns not only been no change in our previous relations with llio iiuU'poiidcnt btntes ot our own continent, but moro fiiendly sentiments than have been heretofore existing are bo- lioved to be enteilnined by theso neighbors, whoso safety nnd'procrcss nro so intimately connected will, our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru and Chili. Tho Commission undor tho Convention with tho Republic of New Granadn closed its sesiion without having nutliled and passed upon nil tho claims which wero submitted lo it. A proposition is pending lo revive the Convention, that it may bo able to do mo.o complete justice. 1 ho joint Commission between the United States and tho Republic of Costa Rica hat completed lis labors nuu submit ted its report. ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH. I have favored tho project of connecting the United Stales with Europo by an At lantic Telegraph, and a similar project to extend llio telegraph fiom San Fiancisco lo connect by a 1'acihc telegiapli with llio lino that is being extonded ncross tho Russian Empire. THE TERRITORIES. Tho Tcnitories of llio United Slalec, with unimportant exceptions, have re mnined uudistuibed by civil wnr, and they hevo exhibited such evidence of prosperity as uislllies nil expeciauon inni some oi them will soon be in a condition lo bo or ganized ns States, nnd be constitutionally admitted into tho Fedeial Union. The immense mineral resources of somo of thojo Teiritorios ought to be developed as lapidlv as possible. Every step in that direction would havo a tendency to mi- niovo tho loveinio of tho Governmunt and diminish tho burdens of tho people. ll is wot thy vour serious consideration whothur soma extraoidinary measures to promoU that end cnunol bo adopted. The means w hich suggests itself as most likely to bo effective, is'n scientific exploration of tho mineral regions in those Territories, with a view of publication of its results at homo and in foieign countries results which canrrot fail to bo auspicious. THE NATIONAL FINANCES Tho condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consulernlion. llio vast expenditures incident lo tho military and nnval operations requiied for tho sup pression of the rebellion, Havo iiiuierio been iwt by a promptitudo and ceitainty unusual in similar ciicumslnnces, nnd tho public cicdil hns been fully maintained. l lio conl.nuanco ot llio war, uowuvur, ami tho increased disbursments made neces sary by tho augmented forccs now in llio field, demand your best lellection as 10 mo best modes of providing tho necessary rev- enno wiinoui injury io uusmcss, nuu uu tho least possiblo burdens upon labor. Tho suspension -of. specie payment by lire bnnks soon nflor the commencement of your last session, made largo issues of United Slates notes unavoidable. In no oilier way could tho payment of tho troops and lbs satisfaction of oilier just demands be so economically or so well provided fur. The judicious "logiilalion of Congress so curing the receiiabilily of theso notes for loans nnd internal duties, nnd making them n leunl lender for other debts has mado . i i .J.n them an universal currency, ni:u nn sni su ed, partially at lo.ist, and for tho time, iho long felt want of an uniform ciiculating mo ilium, saving thereby to tho people im menso sums in discounts nnd exchanges. A return to specio pay mauls, however, at thecailiest period compatible with duoie gaid lo all interests concerned, should ever bo kept in view. Fluctuations in tho vnliui of currency nio always iujuiious, and to re duce tin so fluctuations to tho lowest possi blo point will nlways boa leading purposo in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt nnd certain convertibility, into coin is gen erally ncknowlo'lgul to bo tho best nn 1 surest enfegunrd ngainst them, and it is i-xtremely doubtful whether n circulation of Uuitcd Sinks notes, pnyablo in coin, and sullicii-ntlv lr,r0 for the anls of llio pat pie, can bo peimnnently, usefully nud tnfely mnintaiiud. . Is there, then, any other mod,' m wh.cit tho necessary provision for tho public wauls can bo made and tho great advantages of n safo and uniform currency secured? I know of nona which promises so certain results and at the Bamo time so unobject ionable ns tho organization of banking associations under a general net of Con gross, well guarded in its provisions. lo such nssocialious tho government might furnish circulating notes on tho security of United States bonds deposited in tho Treasury. Thoso notos, prepared under tha supervision of proper officers, being uniform in nppearanco nnd security, and convertible always into coin, would nt once protect labor ngaiint tho evils of vioious curroncy, aud facilitate commorco by cheap and safo exohanges. A inodorato .... . i .... . , . I I loscrvnuon irom uio micron on mo iwiius would compensate tho United btalos for l 111 ll IJJ'Vl HIM'll fllUt illitritiulion or llio notes, and a goiicrnl . supervision of tlio system, nnd would lighten tho burden of thnt part of tho public debt employed as senility. Tlio public audit, iiioicom, would bo greatly improved, and llio ncgo linliou of now loaus greatly facilitated iiy tho steady market demand for government bonds, which tho adoption of llio propos ed system would create. It is an addilional recommendation of lire measure of considornbto weight iu my jtidgomorit that it would reconcile, ns far as possible, all existing iutereslH by tho opportunity offered to existing institutions to ro-orgnnizo tinder tho act substituting only llio secured, uniform nntionai ciictt- lalion for tho local nnd various circular lions, secured nnd unsecured, now issued I... .

Tho receipts into tho Trensury from nil sources, including loans and balnuco from llio preceding year for tho fiscal year end ing on llio 30th of June, 1802, wero $58.1,- 885,217 00, of which sum ?! l0,0i)8,.10T 02 wero derived Irom customs; $I,iU.v 331 73 fiom the direct lax; from public lands 152,203 77; from misoolhincous scources, 8031,787 01; from loans in nil forms 0520,002,100 50. Tho remainder, $2,257,005 80, wns tho balanco from last year. The disbursement during tho samo period were: For Congresionnl, Execut ive and Judical purposes $5,030,1)09 20; for foreign intercourse $1,330,710 35; fur miscellnriious expenses including mints, loans, poslollice deficiencies, collection of revenue nnd other charges $11,120, 771 50; for expenses undor tho Interior Department $3,102,085 52; under tho War Department $30 1,308,407 30; under tha Navy Department $42,074,580 09; for interest on public debt $13,190, 324 45, and for tho payment of the pub lic debt, including reimbursement of tem porary loan and redemptions $90,090, 922 09, making an nggiegato of $570, 841,700 25, and lcr.ving n balanco in the Treasury on the fusl day of July, 1802, of $13,043,110 81. It should b'e observed that tho sum of $90,000,922 09, expended for reimbursements nnd redemption of tho public debt, being included also in tho loans made, may bo properly deducted both from the receipts and expenditures, leaving tho actual receipts for tho year $487,788,324 07, and tho expenditures $474,744,788 10. Other information on the subject of Iho linnneei will bo found iu tho roport of the Sccrotnry of tho Trensury, lo whoso statement nnd views 1 invito your most candid nnd considerate attention. ! DEPARTMENT REPORTS. Tho reports of tho Secrelnrios of tho Navy and War nro herowilli linnsinitled. These repoii, though lengthy, nre scnicely moro than brief extincls of tho very nu merous nnd cxleusivo transactions nnd opeintions conducted thiough these do pnrtments. Nor could I give a Mimmaiy of them hero upon nny principle which would admit of its boing much shorter than the lepoits themselves. I therofoio content myself wilh laying tho repot Is be fore you, nnd nskingyou attention to lliem. It gives me pleasure to leport a decided improvement in tho financial condition of tho Pustollico Department, as compared with the seveial preceding ycnis. The re ceipts for tho fiscal year 1801, amounted to $S, 349,290 40, which oinbrnco.l tovunue fiom nil tlio Stntes of tho Union for thrco quarters of that year. Nolwilh standing the cessation of revenuo fiom the so called Confedeinto Stales during tho Inst fiscal yenr, llio incienso of llio corre spondence of tho loynl States has been sullieient to produce a revenuo during tho samo year, of $8,209,820 90, b'dng only $50,000 less thnn was derived from all iho States of the Union during ilia previ ous yenr. Tlio expenditures show a still moie fnvoiabU remit. Tho amount expended iu 1801 was $13,000,709 11. For tho Inst year the amount has been leduced lo $11,125,304 13, showing n decreaso of about $2,481,000 00 in the cxpondituies, as compaied with tho preceding year, nnd about $3,750,000 ns compared wilh the yenr of 1800. Tha deficiency in tho De partment for the previous yenr wns $ 1,551, 900 98. For the Inst fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,81 1 57. These favor able results aro in part owing lo iho cessa tion of mail seivico in tho insurrection ary Slates, nnd in pint to n careful ro view of all oxpondituies iu tho Dcpnt Intent in the interest of economy. Tho efficiency of the postal soivice, it is bolioved, has also been much improved. Tho Postmaster General nlso opened n correspondence thiough tho Depailmcut of Stnlo wilh foreign governments, pro posing a convention of postal rcpresenla iive.,'for llio puiposo of (simplifying tho rales of foieign postage and to expedite the foieign mails. This ptoposition, equally iinportnnt to our ndoplod citizeus nnd to tho commeicial inletcsls of this coutitt y, has boon favoinbly enteilnined nnd agreed to by all tlio governments Irom whom replies havo been received. 1 ask tho attention of Congiess to tho sugges tion of tho Postmaster General, in his ic poil respecting llio further legislation tc quired, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postnl feci vice. Tlio Secroiniy of tho Interior reporls as follows in regard lo public lands: Tho public lands hnvo censed lo bo n sourco of revenue. From tho 1st of July, 1801, to the 30th of September, 1802, the cnliio cash receipts from tho sale of public lands vvoio $137,470 20, a sum much less thnn tho expenso of our land syslom during tho same period. Tho homestead law, which will lako effect on iho 1st of Jnnunry next, ofiers such inducements to settleis that sales for cash cannot bo expected lo nn ox lent sufficient to meet Iho expenses of tha General Land Ollico nnd cost of suivoying nnd bringing tho land into market.

Tho Indian Iribca upon our frontier, hnvo, during tho past enr, manifested n spirit of insubordination, and nt several points engaged in open hostilities against tho while settlers in their ncinily. Tho tribes occupying tho Indian country south of Knnsns, renounced t heir allegiance with tho United Stales, and entered into treaty with tho insurgents. Those who remain ed loyal to tho United Slates were driven irom tho country. The chief of the Cher okees has visited tin's city for tho purpose ol restoring tho former relation of lire tribo with tho United Stntes. Ho alleges that they wero constrained by superior forco to enter into treaties with the insurgents, nnd . 1.., .1. TT. .!. . CI! . , I . . I . t ! I nun mc utmcd oinius ni-giecieu 10 ruririsii tlio protection which their treaty stipula tion requires. In the month of August Inst, the Sioux Indians in Minnesota at tacked tho settlers in their ticinity with exlre.no ferocity, killing, inducri.ninalely, men, women and children. This attack was wholly unexpected, nnd thoicforyio menns of defense had been provided. It is estima ted that not less than 800 persons wero killed by iho Indinirs, and n largo amount of pioperly destroyed. How this outbreak was iuducod is not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not bo slnted. Inforiruition wns received by the Indian llureatt fiom difft-reiit sources nhoul tho time hostilities were commenced, that n simultaneous attack was to be mado upon tho white settlements by nil the tribes between tho Mississippi river nnd tho Rocky Mountains. Tlio Slato of Minne sota has suffered great injury from this In dian war. A largo pot lion of her territory has been depopulated, and n severe loss Iras btcn sustained by tbo destruction of property. The paoplo of thnt Slato manifest much anxiety for tho removeal of the tribes be yond the limits of tho Slate as a guarantee ngainst fnluio hostilities. Tlio Commis sioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details. I submit for your special consideration whether our Indian system shall not bo remodeled. Many uiso and good ' men have been impressed wilh the belief that this can be done. ' I PACIFIC RAILROAD. I submit a statement of tho proceed ings of Commissioners, which shows Iho progress that has been mado in the enter prizo of constituting the Pacific railroad, aud ibis suggests llio earliest completion df the road, and also tho favorable action of Congress upon llio projects now pend ing neiorn lliem lor oninrginp ino cnpncuies of the great canals iu New York and llli nois,ns being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, nnd es pecially lo the vast interior region herein after to be noticed at tomo greater length.

Tho military nnd commercial im portance of enlarging the Illinois nnd Michi gan cnnnl,nud improving tho Illinois river, is pioscntcd in the leport of Colonol Web ster to tho Sectotniy of War and now tiniumitted to Congiess. I respectfully nsk attention lo it. To cany out llio provisions of tho net of Oonpress of tho Ifllh of Alny Inn, I Imio caused lire Dejinitmont of Agriculture of tho United Stntes lo ho organized. Tho Commissioner inloiius mo within tho puriod of a few months this depnit ment has established an extensive kvs tern ol conespondi'iicc and exchanges, both at homo and abroad, which promises to effect highly beneficial results iu tho de velopment of a coirtct knowledge of re cent iinpiovemuuls in agiicultuie, to tho introduction of new pioducts and in llio collection of tho ngnculluial statistics of tho different Stales: also that it will soon ba prepaied to distributo largely, seeds', phittls and culling", and has already pub lished and liberally diffused much valuable information in anticipation of n moio elaborate repot I, which will in duo timo bo furnished, embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progiess in tlio laboialoiy.

On tho 22d day of September last n pioclnmalion was issued by the Executive, a copy of which is heiowith submitted. In accoidaiico ivilli the putpose, oxpiessed in tho second paiagiaph of that papur, I now icspeclfully cnil your attention lo what may bo called "Compensated Eman cipation." A nation may bo said to con sist of its leiritoiies, its peoplo nud its laws. The territory is (ho only pait which is of ecilniti durability. "One geneiiition pass elh away arid another geneiation cometh, but iho enilh abideth forever." It is of tho first importnnco to duly consider and estimate this cvcr-cndiiiing part. Thntpoition of tho eailh's surfneo which is owned and inhnbiled by tho peo ple of iho United Stales is well adapted lo bo tho homo ofono national family, and is not well ndnplcd for two or moro. Its vast extent and its variety of climate aud pioductions ara of ndvnnlngo in this nge for one people, w hntover thoy might hnvo been in lViner 'ages. Steam, teleginphs nud intelligence have biouht theso, io bo an advnuiagouiis combination, for ono united peoplo. In tho inaugural nddrcss I briefly point cd out llio tolnl inadequacy of disunion n a remedy fm dilitficncos between tho people of tho two sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which, thero foio, I beg lo repeat. Ono scctiou of our country believes sla very is right and ought lo bo extended, while tha other believes it is wrong nnd ought not to bo oxtended. This is the ouly substantial dispute.

The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up on the part of lite seceding section the fugitive slave clause along with oilier constitutional oligalions upon tho section seceded, from which I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever bo mado to lake its place. Uni thero is anotiicr diffi culty. The great interior region hounded orr iho cast by the Alleghatiics, north by iho British Dominions, west by tho Kocky Mountain?, nnd south by tho line alone which iho cultivation of corn nud cot ton meets, and which includes part of Vir ginia, part of Tennessee, nil of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, lib- nou, Muinuri, Kautne, Iniva, Mionsteota. and the territories of Decolah, Nebraska, and a pari of Colorado, already has above ten million of people, and will have fifty million within fifty years, if not prevented by any political folly or mi take. It con tains moro than ono-thitd cf tho country owned by tho United S'nte, certainly more than ono million of square miles. Ono half ns populous ns Masachusotls already is, il would have more than seven ty fivo million of people. A glance at iho map shows that, territorially speaking, it is Ihe great body of Iho Republic. The other parts aro but marginal boilers to it, the magtii(icint region sloping west from the Rockv Mountains lo the Pacific, bo- f ii tj the deepest and nlso tho richest in the . . ., , . undeveloped resources, nr the produeton n. . . i ii i : i revisions, grains, grasses, and nil which . .

" 1 bog indulgence to discuss thoso pro- pnsou nrliclesnl somo length. Without slavery the rebellion could nev.-r have ex- "." divcuitios. lb ciuse of these divorsi- ties we waste much strfnth in tru"2les among ourselves. 15y mutual concession we should harmonizo and act together. This would be compromise; but it would be compromise among the friarid?, and n.it with the enemies of the Union. Thcc nrtieles ara intended lo embody a plan of such mutual concession. If tho plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow, nt least in sev eral ol tha Slates. In the first article the main points nre: first tho emancipation; scconil the length of timo for consumma ting it 37 years ; and third, the compena lion. Tho emancipation will bo unatis feclory to Iho advocate of perpetual sla very, but llio langlh of lim should great ly mitigate their disatisfaciion. Tha time spares both races from the evils of sudden derangement; in fact, from tho necessity of nny derangement ; while most of those whoso habitual couro of llionrrlit will be disturbed bv tho measure will hnvo passed away lufore its consum mation. They will never see it. Another class will hail the prospect of omancipation, but will depricatc lite hmlli of lime. They will feel that it gives loo little to the now living slave, but it real ly gives thnn much. It saves them from tho vagrant destitution which must large ly attend immediate emancipation in lo calities whero their numbers aro vory great, nnd it gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever.

It nlso pro vides for compensation, and generally the mode of makin? it. This it wonld seem must further miti gate the dissatisfaction of thoc who fa vor perpetual slavery, nnd especially those those who nro to receive compensa tion Doubtles some of thoso who are to pay, and not to receive, will objeet. Yet the measure is both just and econom ical. In a certain sense, tlio liberation of slaves is tlio destruction of property prop erty acquit cd by descent, or by purchase, the samo as any other propoity. It is no less trno for having been often said that the people of the South are not more re sponsible for the original introduction of tint property than are people of tho jvottli; ' and when it is remembered how uuhesi - , tatingly we all nso c3iton aud sugar, and lofits of doaling in them, it shnro tlin ninfit.s may not be quite safo to say, tliat the South has been mote responsible ;han the North, for its continuance. If, then, for a common object, this property is to bo sacrificed, is it not just thnt it bo donont a common charge? And if with le money, or money more easily pant, we " .i - - - . ' . can piescrVe tlio benchts of tho Union by this meaps than wo cau by the war alone, is it not economical to do it . Ect us const Icr it then. Let us asco:- tain tho sum wo have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was proposed last March, and consider whelh- ar, if that mcauire had been promptly ac cepted, by even somo ot tho Slavo States, tho same sum would not havedono more to close tho war then has been otherwise done. If so, tho measure would save money, and, in that viow, would bo a pru dent and economical measure. CcrtaiY.ly it is not so easy to pay something ns it is to pay nothing; but it is easier to pay a largo sum, than it is to pay a largor ono. And it is easier to pay any sum when wo are ablo than it is to pay it be foio woaro able. Tho war requites largo sums, and requires them at once. Tho aggregate sum necessary for compensa ted emancipation, of cotnsj, would bo large. lint it wquld rcquiro no ready cash ; nor tho bonds oven, any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would not, closo bo fore thociid of thiitv-sevcn ycais. At that timo wo shall probably havo a 100,000.000 people to bhaio tho burden instead of 31, uOO.000, ns now. And not only so.but ih increase of our population may bo ex pected to continue for a long timo aftor that period, as rapidly as befoio; becauso our territory will not havo bacotno full. I do not btato this incousidoratcly. At the samo ratio of increase which wo have maintaiuod, on an avorago from our fiist national census in 1790 until that of 1SG0, wo idiould, in 1900 havo a population of 10320S.-115, nnd why nny wo not con- I (Inr nUn.l.ni i ... . ." .. , " "lj " "1 r "roau nnuon- ' ni iionrcjicau, is our anriilo rcsonrco. - Wore onr torr torv as lln ito.l . 1, , llriii.l.

It is seen that the ratio of increase at no ono of theso seven periods is cither two per cent, below or two per cent, above tho avcrago; thus showing how inflexible, and, conse quently, hovi- reliable the law of increase. in our caso, is. Assuming that it will continue, gives the following results: lS7n -12,323,311 1S?0 50,907,21 fi lfc-90 7C,G77,872 10110 103,20i,115 1910 13S,3I?,52G 1920 1FG,9P.,335 1.30 jl,C;0,Utl These figures that show our country may bo as populous as Europo now is, at some point between 1920 anil 1930 say about 192ij our territory at 73 persons to tho square mile, being of capacity to contain 217.1SG.000. And wo will reach this, too, if wo do not ourselves relinquish tho chances, by the folly and evil" of disunion, or by long and cxhaustinc war sprincinp: from tho ! onlv great element of nationnl discord among us. While it cannot bo foreseen exactly how much one huge cxamplo of secession breeding lesser ones indefi nitely would retard the population, civil zation, and prosperity, no ono can doubt that tho ex'ent of il would bo very great and injurious. The proposed emancipa tion would shorten tho war, perpetuate peace, insure this increase in population and, propoitionately, tho wealth of tho country. With theso wo should pay all tho emancipation would cost, together wi'h our other debts, easier than wo should pay our other debts without it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at 6 per cent, per annum, simplo interest, from the end of our revolutionary slrngglo till to-day without paying anything on either on principal or interest, each man of us would owe less on that debt now, than each man owed upon it then, and this be cause onr increase of men through tho whole period has been greater than G per cent., and has run faster than the interest upon the debt. Thus timo alono relieves a debtor nation so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest ac cumulates on iti debt. This fact would bo no cxcufo for delay- j in? the nnvmcnt of what is Justly due, f ,Mt it shows tho great importance of time in this connection, the gieat advan tage of a policy by which wo shall not have to pay until wo nnmbcr 100,000, 0U0, when "by n different policy wo would have to pay now when we number but31,
