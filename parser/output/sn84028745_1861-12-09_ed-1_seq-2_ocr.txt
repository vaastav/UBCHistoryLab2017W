Chase, Secrotarv of ths Treas ury, Lbs issued an important order relative to the seizure of property In disloyal States by the national forces, llio order provides, in brief, tbat there shall be agents appointed in the different places conquered by our arms, who shall secure and prepare for market the cotton, rice and such other pro ducts as may be seized, and that the naval Bed military authorities shall aid in this work. Slaves or in the euphemism of the Secretary "persons held to service for life under Slate laws" may be employed by the agents, and will be organijed for systematized labor, in securing and preparing for markot their products. Fay-rolls will be prepared, end a just compensation allowed to these laborers, the amount to be fixed by the agent, and approved by the military com tnandant and the Secretary of the Treasury. An inventory of all stock and a record of all products taken will be carefully made by the gents and officers. The cotton and other foods will be shipped to this city for market, end accounts will be Bottled by the Secretary of the Treasury. The agent must so trans act business, tbat as little Injury as possible tray accrue to loyal citlsens, of those who within reasonable time may assume the character of loyal citizens. Southern Union Sentiment. It is not nnfrequently that we hear some tee remark that It will no.t do to trust to the Union sentiment which is believed to exist in the South for aid In suppressing the rebellion snd restoring the authority of the laws. So far in the South wherever onr arms have been victorious, or the least evi dence of onr success has been manifested, the people in those States seem ready at once to return to their allegiance, and, if it were cot fur the force which threatens them from tbe rebel government and their armed bands, this manifestation would be more lively and extensive in every part of tho South, oxcept, perhaps, in South Carolina the nest of the present conspiracy against popular govern rrent. We know that in Western Virginia and the eastern counties it has been so. In North Carolina, as soon as our forces landed, the people, who felt secure, proclaimed for the Union. eastern lennessee is openly In arms egttinst the usurpation, and in the city tie yi Ork ass tbe Unionists have been found organized against the government, and their organization is found so threatening that the rebel government has become alarmed at its character, and has undertaken to break it np by force and the arrest of the prominent actors in it. Theae facta are all positive in dicutions that the present rebellion does not refit upon the popular sentiment, but maintained by the force with which It was first inaugurated. In faot, it can not be Otherwise, When we look at the prosperity which eveVy-where exlste previous to the rebellion, the security every-where enjoyed, both in property and person, and contrast these advantages, the greatest which any government can confer npon a people, with the miserable prostration of trade In the South, tbe destruction of business, tho suffer ing among tbe people, the vast accumulation of debt to be paid out of their toil hereafter, the desolation and misery of war, and the utter bcpelesssess of ever living in peace, even successful in their purpose of separation, with tbe powerful, wealthy, enterprising and in due trious States of the North, the prospect before the people of the rebellious Btatos tnuat be gloomy, and the present effect sad opening and dieheartealng. Whatever ad vantages promised themselves can be no greater than they were previously enjojiog, while the sacrifice tbey will have to make to effect a change Lringiog no greater benefit ere enough to appal the stoutest hearts, even where a more ennobling cause animated the people to revolution. It is contrasts like these which are bringing the people of the South to their reason, and giving force the opposition agaiost the wicked usurpation. Just in proportion as our arms become tri umphant will this sentiment grow stronger and more active, till tbe rebel power, finding itself pre&sed powerfully from the outside, and weakening continually from the Inside, will be compelled to give way, and the au thority of legitimate popnlar government again extended over a willing people. Honest Joe holt. The Washington correspondent of the BpriDgfield Rrpnlliean says Mr. Linoo'.n pays great respect to the opinions of Mr. Holt in all tbat he does in reference to Ken tucky. A day or two since a Kentucky Re publican, a moderate and moat worthy man, asked a small favor of Mr. Lincoln, and was referred to Mr. Joseph Holt. "If hi says yon ought to be attended to, I will do so," was the reply of tbe President. Tbe man went away somewhat indignant, especially as 11 Iioit was bis old political adversary. Brigadier Thomas A. Morris. There has been considerable surprise man ifested, and not little fault finding in Western States, because Brigadier-General Thomas A. Morris, of Indiana, bus not been assigned a command. General Morris was very successful in Western Virginia daring his short campaign, but his whole force being three months' men, when their time expired they left tbe service, and General Morris was thus forced into retirement, where he has since remained. He is a graduate of West Point, end has the reputation of being a very fine officer. Letters to Soldiers. A volunteer writes home and asks why friends do cot write ofiener. He says "No one knows the joy of receiving a letter until he has been a soldier. It comes like a wel come messenger from old familiar scenes and is welcomed as a friend direct from home. Write often to your soldier friends, and write cheerful, brave letters, about all the affairs at home. Children write tbe best letters, they tell all the little things tbat happen." If it is such a luxury to receive letter, see bo reason why the brave fellows bow service shonld not have a continued taut. It is a cheap and not unpleasant way to abeeat enes tbat they are still kindly remembered. Let all who have friends the army try it Fire and Brimstone. A citizen of Salem, Mass., well known for his inventive genius, has given his attention to the subject, and, ills said, has concocted a preparation which, when Ignited, becomes an unquenchable flame of fire and brimstone. Ee proposes to put it u p in glass bottles, make an ascension in a balloon, Boat over tbe camps of the rebels, toss over the bottles, which, npon breaking, will explode and set the camp on fire and blow np ammunition wagons making them, to use Scriptural largnage, as Sodom and Gomorrah. Not to speak profanely, in bis teal to preserve the Government, he wants to give the rebels a foretaste of the wrath to comet There may be difficulties In the execution of such a plan, but a few experiments would test its efficacy. It would be a novelty in war to see fire and brimstone rained npon the jpbel?, but stranger things have happened. We pre sume this is tbe Yankee who proposes to close the war on "contract." The Land Office. The report of Mr. Edmonds, Commissioner of tbe General Land Office, shows that since the 30ih of June, 18G0, there have been sur veyed 8,892,125 acres of the public lands, which have not yet been offered for sle. There were previously surveyed 46,063,470 acres, which still remain-nnoffered, making a total of surveyed lands unoffered of 55,555,. DCS acres, all of which is subject to pre' eruption prior to the actual offering thereof at pnblio sale. To this may be added sur veyed lands heretofore offered in different land States and Territories, which were lia ble to "private sale," and also to pre-emption on the 30th September, 1861, being In the aggregate T8, 662, 735. 64 acres, making a total surveyed, unsold, offered and unoffered, on the 30th September, 1861, of 134,218,339.89 acres. Since the last annnal report no new proclamation has been Issued for the sale of publio lands, Archbishop Hushes' Visit to Europe. The Dublin Freeman' I Journal, of the 20th November, reports the object of Archbishop Hughes' visit to Europe thus : The Most Eev, Dr. Hughes, Arohbiehop of New York, was among tbe passengers on board the Africa, which arrived at Qnecnstown on Monday. Bis Grace will stay a short while in this country, in order to obtain a sufficient ntrnv ber of Catholic clergymen to afford a chap lain to each of the Union regiments requiring one. lie will then proceed to Rome to ob tain the necessary power to grant facilities to such chaplains, so that they can ofiioiate In whatever dioonse the regiments to which they may be attached may happen to be. Our Foreign Policy. of President Lincoln avows his purpose to adhere to a cautious and prudent policy in relation to foreign affairs. There need be no apprehensions of the ocenrrence of hostli itles between the United States and Great Britain; for, unless the British Government should seek a pretext for war, there U no ground for creating serious difficulties. It Is said tbe Cabinet at Washington feels no anxiety on this subject, believing that temperate policy will allay excited feelings and tend to cement the friendly relations which have hitherto existed between the two countries. An Item Not in the Bill. A eye-witness of the arrest of Messrs, Mason and Slldell furnishes the Panama Star and Herald with some particulars of the affair, which would be amusing If they were not so seriously told. Miss Slidell, we learn from this veracious observer, not only re sisted the attempts of Lieutenant Fairfax to take possession of her father, but went so far as to bare her breast, defying death, itself. The former Captain of the Jeff Davis, it is said, was a passenger onboard the Trent, but escaped observation.

Interesting Southern News. The Richmond Diipaich of Saturday, the , 30th, bas tbe following telegram from Charleston: Charleston. November 29. The patriotlo planters of the seaboard are hourly applying tbe torch to their crops of cotton and rice. Those who have not the heart to apply the torch themselves have authorized tbe mili tary authorities, to save'their crops from tbe ravages ana lust or tne enemy, to aestroy every thing before them. Tbe plantations on North Edistoand its neighborhood, are now in one theet of flames and smoke throughout. Parties from below unite In saying that every thing is wrapped In one vast name. General Humphrey Marshall has written a lying letter to tne war .Department at Richmond, in reference to the battle at Piketon, Ky. He says : The Piketon battle occurred with 300 Con federates against 1,500 Federals. Our troops lost one killed, four wounded and seven missing. Tbe Federal loss was killed, 200 counted, 140 wounded and 200 prisoners. Tbe unequal loss resulted from the fact that our men were successfully ambuscaded, and tbe enemy were entrappea. Tbe Utmpbis Appeal, ot tne zuin nit., contains tbe proceedings of a meeting of merchants, held in tbat city, to devise a sub stitute for silver change, which has almost wholly disappeared. Tbe ordinary price of changing a bill is from eighteen to twenty per cent. Tbe meeting recommended that the banks cut tneir nous so as to mate mem pssa for quarter and half dollars. Provisions are abundant and cheap in Charleston, according to a statement in the Courier. That paper of November 29 quotes flour at $10 to $11; bacon and bams 32 cents per pound; salt if 10 per sack; Drown sugar 8 to 12 oents: no coffee to be had. and cotton 8 cents tor npland. Generally provisions are cheaper and more abundant than is supposed at tbe florin, tnrougnout ail tne soma At lantic States. 

ANOTHER BATTERING RAM. [From the New Orleans Bulletin.] a seen an ¬ proved battering ram, by Mr. B. B. Bishop, a gentleman well known In connection with dredging, machinery, boats, &o,, which ap pears to as to possess singular advantages, It combines tbe powers and valuable proper ties or w mans cigar steamer witn tnose ot tbe JHanaitat ana otner internal macnines. One of them may be constructed in a com paratively short petlod, with the requisite st stem and enorey, and at a cost of not over $50,000. jNotblnu eonia wllbstana Its power. and Mr. Bishop Is confident that with five of tnese stnguiar vessels tne blockade ot all tne inmortant ports of the Confederacy could be destioved and kept destroyed, and the ports kept open to the commerce of friendly na tions. We may remark that Mr. Bishop's plan of opening channels and deepening them, which was laid before a soientiln board at Washington two years ago, met wiih the entire approbation of the three em inent engineers who composed it, with that of Mr Toucey, Secretary of the Navy, and Mr. Flojd, Secretary of War. He has charter from the Legislature of Louisiana for permanently deepaning the passes at tbe month of the Mississippi and elsewhere, and but for the war would have had the work nndcr way. We tinst that our capitalists will at once move In tbe matter of this new, improved and terrible internal machine. It enn stein tbioogh the waves of the Gulf or Atlautio with tbe ease of a fish, and with a speed un known to Lincoln's men of-war. THE INEXPLICABLE POLICY. [From the Charleston Mercury.] a on The Richmond Dispatch discourses vorv toucbingly of -'tho inexplicable policy," as wince seen uy me extract we publish, be low. Hut it Is very narrow in its views. when It considers it as exempting "cotton placwi" fiom its beneficent operations. South Carolina ts to be next, may be, in suf fering, to Virginia, as it will learn by the news in our columns. The armada is to dis gorge its bate and f ury on South Carolina. We hope President Davis, and the troops on tbe Potomac, lying on their books In the sun, feel very corutoi table, but we do not envy tbam their glorious inactivity: It is vuin to hope that Lincoln or hts nartv will ever make peace as long as they can carry on tbe war npon onr territory. An in explicable policy bas allowed tnein to take possession of a large portion of Virginia, where they are ruiuing the country aud its people as fait as tbey can. As long as they con conduct the war in that way, so long will they refute to listen to peace. Only by carrying It into their own territories can tbe people of Yankeedom be reached, and made to take tbe matter out of tbe bands of the politicians. As things are managed at pres ent we have no hope of such a consumma tion. Virginia bas been selected as the battle-field. It is not enough that she has 70,000 men nnder arms it is not enough that she has furnished 83,000 stand of arms to troops belonging toother States it is not enough that she has fed the whole enormous army congregated on tbe Potomac for months it is not enough that she has fur Dished them with cannon, and powder, and balls it is not enOngh that she has done more for this war than all the other States the Cotitederacy put together she must made made by ber friends to feel the full weight of it. Her richest counties mast occupied by the enemy, who are by rueans to be disturbed, Jest, if they be de- rtateo, isoy snouia xiy into Maryland, ana into Maryland they must not be pursaed. Tbe enemy are not to be repelled, lest should disturb some strategic combination. t-Lie is regarded as but a geographical expres sion but a field for the exercise of grand strategic combination, in which she is sure to be pint deied. no matter what the result maybe. But patience. This slate of things can not l&tt more than eix years. It will ruin tbouennds of loyal Virginians; but what r - l .

I also sent one out by the steamer A'atSvitl; wbioh left this port last Saturday night, bat whether that this letter will ever reach you, is more than I can tell. I will tell you now I am going try to send this the privateer Sallie brought in a prize here last Sunday, and her passen gers are boarding here at the house where am. I abked one of them to take a letter out with him to Cuba and mail it for me; said he would, and that be was going leave in the morning. The times are dull enough here now, and as there is comparatively nothing doing tbe stores, tbey close from two to tour o'clock in the afternoon. There is nothing doing except for the army. There are very goods in the city now, and what there are bringing just what they choose to for them. I wi.l give you a list of some atd their prices I Cotton flannel, 60 60c. per yard ; coarse cloths any price; blan kets, none to be had; shoes (coarse brogam), none to be bad, last sold at $3 per pair; bacon 25c. per ponnd; bam, 3i)4c. per ponnd; bat ter, 60c. per pound, and most other things (except rice) in proportion. Every luxury that we used to bave from abroad is dis pensed with now. We have bad no weather here jet, but it is nearly time for frost. It is expected that some visitors from the North will be down this way before long, and arrangements are making to give them a warm reception. The coast is very fortified. The prisoners were maved from Castle Pinckney, yesterday, to their quarters in tbe jail, anil they are going fortify tbe castle. If the United States troops do no better tiae to come than they bave as yet, I think tbe war will be a short one, for I bave known of their being victorious as yet once (at Hatteras), and the battle of Manas sas was a great defeat, and a most shameful ailair on the Federal side; but probably newspaper accounts printed at tne North wis South do not agree first rate. I should like to see a Northern paper very mucn, but there It BO Inch thing here. Some say the war will be a long one, and some say it will be short there all kinds of conjectures but I hope it may be short. Tbe worst thing that can befall a Government is civil war, and this I believe to be the worst kind of oae. It in like brothir fighting against brother. There are a great many people here that have very near relations and friends in ins norm. I think it would have been far better for the United States Government to have let the Sonth gone, and I think they will repent yet that they did not. OUR FOREIGN AFFAIRS. WASHINGTON, Thursday, December 5. The miners relation to foreign affairs, aoeom- ranving tbe President's Message, cover four hnndred and twenty-five pages. Minister Adams writes to Mr. Beward, May 17. annonnolos: bis safe arrival at London. &o.. to which Mr. Seward replies that l This Government eonilders that our relations In Europe have reacbed a oriels, in whloh It Is Decesiary for It to take a decided stand, on whloh not only its Immediate measures, but Us ultimate and permanent policy, on be deter mined and defined. At the same time it nei ther means to menace Great Britain nor to wound the snseeptibllity of that or any other European nation. That polioy is developed in this paper. After instrnotlog Mr. Adams on the subjeot of the blockade, Ac, Mr. Seward ssvs i As to the recognition ef the so-called South ern Confederaev, it is not to ba mad the sub ject of technical definition. It Is, of coarse, rilrunt rMOffiiltion to cuDiisa an bokdowibuk- tnent of tbe sovereignty and independence of a new Power. It Is direct recognition u re ceive its Embarsadors, Ministers, Agents or nnmmlialonara officially. A oonoession of bel ligerent riffhi is liable to be construed as a reoofmltion of them. No one of these pro eeedioM will pus unquestioned by th United States In this cfcse. Mr. Adams, In a subsequent dispaton, details his Interview with Lord John Rnssell, remark- ins that Lord Russell said "he did not himself know waat ne was to say. xi it was expeoieu of him to give any pledge of an absolute na tare that hts Government would not at any future time, do matter what the otroumstanoes might be, recognise an existing Btata in Amer Isa. It was more than be could nromle," o. In the course of the oorrespondenoe Mr. Beward says: "The British Government can never expet to Induce the United States to acqulesoe in ber aBnmed position of tils Government as divided In any degree in tbe powers of war more than for peace. At the same time, If Her Majesty's Government shall continue to practice absolute forbearance from any interference in onr domes tic affairs, we shall not be captious enongh to inauire what name It sivos to that forbearance, or in wnat cnarsocern present r.scu oeioro ids Britlfh nation In doles so.

RELATIONS WITH FRANCE. The correspondence wjth France ts volnmln on; Btoretarr Seward to Minister Dayton, May 30, says: I first desire that M. Thouvenel may be in formed that this Government can not but regard ar-y communications held by the French Gov ernment, even though unofficial, wlih the agents of the Insurrectionary movement in this country, as exceptional and injurious to the dignity and Donor ot tne united states, 'xney piotrot against this Intercourse, however, not so much on that ground as on another. They deelre to maintain the most cordial relations wl'h tbe Government of France, and would therefore, if possible, refrain from complaint; but It is manifest that even an unofficial recep tion of the emissaries of disunion has aoertaln though measured tendency to give them a pres-ige wblcb would encourage weir eilorta to prosecute a civil war aeetruouve to tne pros perity of this country, and aimed at the over i brow of tbe Government itself It is earnestly hoped tbat this protest may be sufficient to relieve this Government from the necessity of an action in the nnpleasant subject to whioalt related. Secondly The United States cut not for moment allow the French Government to rest under the delusive belief that they will be con tent to bave th Con ft derate States reoognlzed as a belligerent power by States with whiob.tb.la catien is In amity. No concert of action among foreign States so lecogntslog the insurgents, can reconcile the United Bute to auoh a proceeding, whatever may be the oonseqaenoe of resiu'enee. Thirdly The President turns away from theee points of apprehended aificrenee of opin ion between the two Governments, to Bailee other and more agreeable subjoot. Mr. Dayton to Mr. Seward, May SO, sayst of be be no it I am hat py to say there ts no disposition manifested here, so far as I have observed, favor the rebellion in onr Southern States, to eneoBrage them as an Independent power. All recognition of rights on their part is for commercial nurposes only.

The steamer Vanderbilt arrived at New York on Friday last from Port Royal, 8. O. Nothing of special importance bad tran spired since the departure of the steamer The naval expedition WAS fitting out with all possible speed, and would leave on its mission ss soon as the troops from Fortress Monroe and Annapolis should arrive. Port Roral Harbor bas been surveyed and buoys bave been placed, so that a vessel drawing twenty-five feet of water can enter troops continues. Beaufort is still unoccupied by tbe Federal troops. Visits are daily made to that place by officers of the army and navy. Several transports were busily discharging stores, ordnance, Ac, at Port Royal. Tbe contrabands to the number of about one thousand still remained In the vicinity of the forts, and others were coming in. The large stores of potatoes, vegetables and fruit lett by tne anrigntea reoeis was turnisning an abundant supply of wholesome food, and the negroes, as well as many of the troops, were employed in securing it. Large numbers ot cattle, nogs ana Dorses had naturally fallen into the possession of the slaves, as well as furniture and household effects, which they were offering for sale at any price tbe soldiers were willing to pay. 

REBEL PROPERTY SEIZED. The Seventy-ninth Regiment had been on an expedition toward Charleston, captured three batteries and spiked the guns, retut ned after having a reconnoissance to within twenty miles of Charleston. A large amount of cotton was found stored ready for ship ment, but the rebels were Improving every opportunity to burn and destroy it. Tbe ea!y reply to General Sherman's pro clamation was "Take care of yourselves and Ill .fnn,,.!..,, nnunnull. none but slaves occupied Beaufort. THE REBELS BURNING COTTON. Four days before the Vanderbilt sailed, a gun boat want up one of the rivers in the vicinitv oi t on itovai. ana remained over night. On the passage up vast quantities of cotton were discovered stored ready lor gin ning. The gun-boat penetrated for several miles. JNO rebels were discovered; but on the return the cotton which had been noticed was found on fire: and as far as could be seen in all directions dense smoke rose in cloud?, indicating tbat an organized ettort to burn all the cotton, and probably other property, bad been made. The rebels, it is thought, were nnder the impression that the vessel baa come for tbe purpose ot seizing it. How ever, not a single white man was seen. An Arrival from Nashville. Mr. A. B. Barker, arrived from Nashville, Tenn., last evening, having left that place on tbe 23d nit. He made bis way to this city with much difficulty, as he was known to be a Union man, and was nnable to obtain a pass from the rebel authorities. Mr. Barker has resided in Nashville during the past two years, and, as he was immediately connected with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad op to tbe time of his departure, enjoyed fine opportunities for observing the movements of the arrnv in ttiat Quarter. It will be remembered that Governor Har ris, of Tennessee, made a requisition a few months ago, for thirty thousand men and additional arms. The eall met, with no response whatever, and the authorities were compelled to resort to a drcift in order to fill the requisition. The vf ork of drafting com menced in Nashville the day of his depart ure. He estimates the number of rebel troons between Nashville and Bowling Green at twenty-eigut tD.ou.woa. xie assures as that ther are miserably fed and badlr clothed. aud that there is a great deficiency in tbe matter of arms.
