Resignation ap peals to he their specially, to be used as threauningly as a Frenchman uses a challenge to a duel. Senator Till man claims the honor of originating this method of settling disputes and determining party standing. When the question arose as to which Senator had the confidence of the South Caro lina voters both sent their resignation to the Governor, while the conn r> waited breathless!} - for the result. Governor McSwteury had no idea ol seeing his Stale fought over in a double contest for re-election and decided that he had no power to accept their resig nations. Those documents were care fully returned by the United States mail, but they were not to rest in peace. Each Senator appears to carry his resignation around in his hip pcckct, like a six shooter, and pull it out wLem ver there is a sign of trou ble. Whether Mr. Tillman speaks at Edgefield or in the Senate Chamber he brandishes his resignation like a weapon of war. When Mr. MeLaurin addresses a gathering of commercial expansionists in New York, and when he speaks to his own • admiring fol lowing at Spartanburg, he lays his resignation on the table as a prelimi nary remark. ' But Mr. Tillman lias violated the rules of the game by actually offering to tender his resignation to the Presi dent of the Senate and challenging Mr. MeLaurin to follow his example. As Mr. Till man adjudges himself proprie tor of the South Carolina Legislature be probably thinks he is entirely safe in taking this step. Mr. MeLaurin, who is bec< niing known as South Caro lina's “Senator-al-Large,” and is recom mcndid to fame as the leader of the Ccir.mei eial South, docs not seem anxious to doff the crown of laurel and wage war for indorsement. He very properly thinks his colleague has gone a step too far. In i (filing actually to tender i.is resignation Senator Tillman has almost spoiled the fun.— Baltimore Sun. DEMOCRATS INCONFEKENCE One of the series of conferences which ex-Scnator Gorman will hold with the Democratic Senators and Delegates, as well as city and State leaders, took place Wednesday after noon at the Hotel Rennert, which will be Mr. Gorman’s headquarters during the winter, sa\ s the Baltimore “Sun.” Those w ho gathered there were Gov ernor Smith, Chairman Murray Van diver. of the Democratic Slate Cen tral Committee; Stale Senator John P. Meiore, of Worcester county ; Dr. George Wells, ol Anne Aiundel coun- I} - ; Slate Senator Jolmzie E. Boas man, of Carroll county, and others. It was stated that the question of the methods to be pursued in the Dem ocratic Legislative contests was the thief subject of consideration. These contests, it is said, will be pushed to a finish and will not be allowed to drop. The Speakership of the House of Delegates, it is authoritatively stated, has not been settled, although the in dications are that Mr. Noble L. Mitch ell, of Harford county, will be the man. Mr. Isaac Lobe Straus is by no means out of the fight, however, and will remain a candidate until the cau cus. It is probable there will be no preliminary conference in Baltimore of the Delegate's before the opening ol the session. Representative Wachter, of Mary land, says the Alexandria “Gazette,” thinks of introducing a joint resolution prohibiting in future the annual foot ball game between the cadets of West Point and those of Annapolis. He characterizes foot ball as more brutal than prize fighting and more danger ous to life and limb. And the game as now played is just as Mr. Wachter de scribes it, anel for this very reason lias it become so popular that men and women travel miles and pay entrance fees to sec the “encounters” just as they eliel in the elays of Rome to see the gladiators. During the season just closed over one hundred young men were killed in “playing’ at foot ball, while the number of injured ran up into thousands. Rut the tendency of the age is toward excess, and now nothing in moderation satisfies the masses of the people. The llay-Pauncefolc Treaty was dis cussed by the Senate in executive ses sion on Wednesday. Senator Bacon, of Georgia, declared the now conven tion is no better than the old one and that it dues not give the United Stales entire control of the propped Isthmian I PROPOSED FISH LAWS. The Maryland State Game and Fish Protective Association desires to give notice to all who way lie interested, that it proposes to make a most earnest and active effort to secure the passage of cer tain gcneraltish laws, from which it be lieves it lias successfully eliminated all - provisions, which past and present ex perience have shown to be objectionable, ■ and the purport eif which is set forth in detail below. It makes th's announcement for the following reason : First and foremost, because it not only fully realizes the need, but most earnest ly desires, the aid aud.advice of everyone interested in the preservation and increase of the food dishes in our waters, whether such person be engaged in fishing for a living or for pastime. Secondly, because it believes that hither to its motives have been misunderstood and that it has been unjustly charged with favoring legislation in the interests of a few spoilsmen, to the exclusion of the rights of the much larger and more important class of our citizens, who are employed in the laudable business of capturing fiisb for market and for a liveli hood, whereas the Association -can, with a clear conscience, affirm, that,- while in such measures, which it has from lime to time proposed, it may have erred in judg ment, it has ever been impartially desi rous and mindful of the best interests of all—the market fisherman and the sports-’ man alike. Thirdly, because it has been unjustly charged with endeavoring, in times past, secretly to introduce bills for passage in the Legislature, whereas it lias always be lieved, and still believes, that all under handed methods in this regard are both obnoxious and reprehensible and it there fore desires hereby, to make know in advance, and most fully, what legislation it is now projecting, in order that this time, at all events, there may be no mis understanding of its motives. Fourthly, and finally, because it believes that every one who stops to consider will appreciate and admit, that one general law, applicable to the whole State, is far more desirable than many and often con flicting local statutes, for the simple and manifest reason, that the former is more readily enforceable now ; of such a charac ter are the proposed laws whose provi sions are here set forth and for which it bespeaks, in advance, the co operation and counsel of all interested citizens of the State of Maryland. The Association proposes three sepa rate, general bills; 1. A bill applicable to all t’de and salt waters and only to them. 2. A bill applicable to all fresh waters above tide and only to them. 3. A bill whose sole objects is to abolish the use of pound, purse and staked or other fixed nets, in tide-waters, for a period of five years. The first and salt water bill Ceiutaius the following provisions: 1. Fish to be caught only for food. 2. Haul seines, buck and gill-nets to be lawful in the Chesapeake Bay proper the entire year and in the tide-water tribu taries of the same from November first to June thirtieth, inclusive: the object of this provision being to so frame a general law as to meet the requirements of fisher men both in the upper and lower Bay and its tributaries. 3. Dip nets and hooks and lines, (i. e , used as trot lines or with tlie hand eir on rod and reel or in any other way.) lawful throughout the entile year. 4. No seines hereafter to be lauded on the shore; the object of this being to pre vent destruction of under sized fish. 5. No white perch less than seven inches, no yellow perch less than eight inches, no rock or tailor less than ten inches, and no pike less than fourteen inches to be retained. 0. Unlawful to extend any nets more than half way across tide waters. 7. A penal offense to use dynamite or any explosive substance in tide-waters, except for bona fide engineering or mining purposes. 8. A license necessary for all residents of this State if eugageel in the business of fishing, i. e., if they use haul-seines, buck or gill-nets to capture fish in tide-waters for sale, the ceist of which license shall be $3 00 per annum, to gether with a fee of 25 cents to the Clerk for issuing same, to be paid by applicant; but no license necessary for those who use dip nets or hooks and lines. 9. Non residents not allowed to fish at all for market within the limits of the State of Maryland. And after these provisions follow only the penalties and method of procedure applicable to the respective violations. The fresh water bili contains the fol lowing provisions ; 1. Black bass, pickerel and pike perch, otherwise known as wall-eyed pike anel California salmon, not to be caught be tween April first and Jung fifteenth (the object of this provision being to protect these fish eiuring their spawning season). None of these fish to be caught at any time of any size less than ten inches in length or in any manner except in the manner known as angling, L.e., with rod and reel or with a line equipped with a single hook, cither baited with natural bait or fed with artificial flies or by the use of spoons or spinners, each equipp ed with a single hook only. 2. Unlawful to lake white perch under seven inches long, yellow perch under eight inches long, pike under fourteen inches long and rock or tailor under ten inches long. This, a repetition of salt water bill. 3. Diamond back terrapin protected during their spawning season, i e., from April first to October thirty first, and un lawful to take them at any time smaller than five inches King on the under shell or to keep them in confinement during their said spawning season, or at any time to hunt or destroy their eggs. 4. Unlawful to so obstruct streams con taining or stocked with trout as to pre vent said fish from freely going up and down stream. 5. Owners of all dams on rivers re quireel to keep fish ladders on same, so as to permit fish freelyjo go up anel down said rivers. (3 No nets or seines to be landed on the shores of any waters, salt or fresh, and no under sized fish to be left to perish on the said shores, or anywhere else, when caught: but to be ieturued alive to the water, if possible. 7. Lawful to catch or destroy German carp, or any kind of carp, and cels, at any- time and in any way, except by dynamite, poison, acid, saw dust or shav- | ing= 8. A penal offensi to put in any fresh water, except for bona fide ''(Engineering purposes, any dynamite, or other explo sive, or any lime, poison, aciel, saw dust, shavings or anything injurious to fish life. —s The third preiposed law which prohi bits the use of pound nets, purse nets and all staked or oilier fixed nets, for a period of five years, has the following object in view; To introduce the sea fish, by not des troying their natural food, to run further up the Chesapeake Bay, to permit them to reach their spawning beds in the up permost wateis as to give all of our citizens, alike, a fair and equal chance to capture them, and not confine this privilege to a few fisher men at the mouths of the rivers ; it being the firm conviction of the Association, after long and careful investigation of lire subject, that nothing so largely contrib utes to prevent the general distribution of ocean fish running into our magni ficent Bay*.or is so ruthlessly destructive of under sized fiHi, as nets of the charac ter sought to Tie prohibited by this bill. ■*r OUR 

WASHINGTON LETTER. Washington, D. C, t December 9tb. Mr. Editou: —Almost simultaneously with the opening of Congress the Supreme Court rendered its decision in the “Four teen Diamond Rings” case, declaring that the Philippine Islands are an integral part of the United States and that the provi sions of the Diugley tariff law do not, -therefore, apply to shipments between the islands and the United States. This, of course, leaves the trade absolutely free and threw the protectionists into paroxysms. With this iuceulive in view .he dilatory methods which usually attend the first weeks of u new. Congress have been aban doned, Speaker Henderson lias already named the members of. the Ways and Means Committee and it has held a ses sion with a view to reporting a bill pro viding for tariff regulations between tlie United States and the Philippines. It is believed that the bill will simply apply the provisions of the Diugley tariff without changing any of its rates. The President's message was received with almost unqualified approval by the republicans, and the democrats, while they could detect the erroneous deductions, which are the inevitable concomitant of the acceptance of the protection fallacy in every line that dealt with economic subjects, could uot but admire the frank, direct expression of the individual views of the author. Apart from the specific economic recommendations and reasoning the message is an admirable paper. Congress has received the report of the Isthmian Canal Commission and the Sen ate is in receipt of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty. The latter has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations and that committee has voted unanimously to report the convention for the favorable action of the Senate. It will be promptly ratified. Senator Morgan has reintro duced bis bill providing for the construc tion of the Nicaraguan canal in accord ance with tiie recommendation of the Commission, which favors that route, but to the person who reads carefully between the lines there is reason to suspect that there is, in the promptness with which all this is being doup, something in the nature of a ruse and that it is the hope eif the promoters of the canal to bring the own ers of the Panama route to reasonable terms. They now hold out for approxi mately $70,000,000 more than the Commis sion believes their plant to be worth. The President’s advice on the tariff question quite accords with the views of the high protectionists of his party and when those Congressmen who have advo cated tariff revision have ventilated their opinions to an extent which they believe will satisfy their constituents, and perhaps gain for them some concessions in the way of patronage or local appropriations, they- will graciously consent to have their bills buried in committee and will soon forget - that they ever contemplated the heresy of tariff revision—at least until they have to ask their friends at home to re-elect them. Entirely apart from the question of the merits of the President’s message as demonstrative of statesmanship, etc., it is an exceptional success from a political standpoint. ; It has won the approval of the people and of the capitalists, a by no means easy attainment, and that lias in spired in the members of Congress a re spect which is not uumixed with fear. They appreciate that a president who can at once appeal to both people and vested interests is a man who is not easily downed and they are one and all anxious to stand high in the good graces of the Chief Exec utive. It is, therefore, safe to predict that his stremg recommendation on the subject of Cuban reciprocity will exact far greater consideration than it would have had uot the message proved so popular a elocu meat. After all, the only people to be sacrificed are the beet sugar growers and the cane growers, and they are not either of them of sufficient weight in tlie m liter of ballots to compel very muc'i respect from republican Congressmen. There is i e rieuii.nnndati.il! in the President’s message which should receive the cordial supp r. of Congressmen irre spective of party, and that is his appeal for support of the Postmaster General in his efforts to remove the abuses which have crept into the administration of the laws in regard to second class mail matter. Mr. Roosevelt says that although second class matter constitutes nearly sixty per cent, of the mails, out of a total revenue of $111,031,193 the Post Office Depaitmenl received only $4,299,445 for the transmis sion of that class eif mad. He goes on to siy if the pound rate “were limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law no just exception could be taken." In his annual report the Postmaster General deals with this subject extensively and cites a single instance of a publication w hose admission to the pound rate v as not originally con templated by the framers of the law and which cost the government for transpor tation anel handling $15,057.40, against which the publishers paid postage amount ing to $2,230 88, leaving a net leiss to the Department of $13,320 per weekly issue. An amusing incident occurred the other elay. While st Hiding in the anteroom of the President's n ceplion room I saw a Congressman g . up to Hie Pn.si lent as lie anel Senator Lmi_t came out and say, “I want to say a word for Mr. Blank, who holds a small e ffice in my district—” “What!” the President interrupted. “Is that infernal scoundrel still there? Yes, I knew him when I was on the Civil Ser vice Commission. Yes, 111 lemember j him.” And he left the amazed legislator and passed out with the- Senator. 

BOSTON GOES DEMOCRATIC. The Democrats completely overwhelm ed the Republicans in the city election in Boston on Tuesday, Gen. Patrick A. Col lins being elccteel over Mayor Thomas N. Hpirt by nearly 20,000, the largest plurali ty in a quarter of a century. The Democrats likewise obtained con trol of both branches of the city govern ment, elected their stieet commissioner, Salem I). Chares, and practical!y all their candidates for the school commission. As usual, the city veiled strongly in favor eif license. The result of the canvass was as fully as much a surprise to the Democrats as to their opponents. The most sanguine Democratic prophet last night claimed on ly 7,000, yet this plurality was nearly tri pled. Two years ago Mayor Hart de feated Gen. Collins by 2.281 votes and polled something over 40,000. This vear the total Republican vote for mayor was a trifle over 33,000, the smallest given a party candidate for mayor since 1893, de spite a registration almost 50 per cent, larger than then. Yet Gen. Co’lins re ceived over 53,000 votes, the largest in the history of the city, and he carried 18 of the 25 wards The Republican leaders were inclined to blame the weather, but Ibis does uot account for the tremendous gains made by the Democrats in Republican wards. Naturally there was great excitement in the close wards, and in Se nth Boston two prominent Republican politicians were arrested on suspicion of having obtained repeaters. This, however, was the only unfortunate feature of the day. Massachusetts Republicans vcc not quite as successful in the other city elec tions he-lei Tuesday, as they were in the fourteen lie!e) last week, for, although they carried eleven to the Democrats’ four, the other three being non partisan contests, three Republican mayors were defeated, la Worcestor, Mayor O’Con nell, a Democrat, was defeated. I i Wo-, burn. Mayor Feeney defeated the pres ent mayor, and the city changed from no license to license. In Chelsea, where the Republicans swept the city, there was a change from no license to license for the first time in eleven years. In Newburry port. where license had a firm h del feit twenty years, the city voted no by over 300 majority. One of the stubborn contests was in Balem, where Mayor Hulev's administra tion was indorsed by the vote, although it had been fiercely criticised. The majori ty against license was reduced flora 558 last year te> 75 this year. There was like wise a warm contest in Cambridge. The Democrats succeeded there in electing John H. MrNamcc over Mayor Dickinson by 125. FOR A GREAT UNIVERSITY AT WASHINGTON. “President Roosevelt has received a letter from Andtcw Carnegie, in which the latter offers to make a donation of $10,000,000 to the United States. The letter will be referred to Congress by tb President in a special message. “Mr. Carnegie’s gift is for the purpose of establishing in Washington a universi ty for higher education. As far as liis idea lias been developed, it proposes a gift after the manner of the bequest of James Smithson, the Englishman who gave $1,000,000 for the establishment ami maintenance of what is now known as the Smithsonian Institution. Smithson de sired the institution founded by him to he a factor in ‘the diffusion of scientific knowledge,’ Mr. Carnegie proposes that the university which he is to endow sba’l be the greatest institution in the woild for the development of higher educa tion.” Mr. Carnegie has consultedex President Gilman, of .1 oh ns Hopkins University; President Hadley, i f Yale; President Elieit, of Harvard; ex Pi orient White, eif Cornell, and all the leading e locators eif the c matry. Tuey heartily iud ipsei his pla ;s. The proposed university will not interfere in the least with the educational institutions already established, but will supplement them, for, according to the present plan, its doors will be open only to those who desire to take up a post graduate course. Mr. Carnegie also wants the new university to take the lead in original research, so that the United States can eventually stand side by side w ith Germany, if neit excel that nation in scientific development. “Mr. Carnegie’s plan docs not propose a national university in the sense that an appropriation will be asked eir needed Tlie Government is simply to be trustee of the magnificent endowment, ju-st as it administers the fund bequeathed by . Smithson. It is probable that a board of regreuts will be appointed, as in the case of the Smithsonian Institution, or it may be that the Government will be represent ed upon tlie board of directors, which, it is contemplated, shall consist of men of national reputation. “Mr. Carnegie has kept the proposed endowment a secret until he could defi nite!) - arrange the plans anel scope of the new university. Even vet all these de tails have not been arranged, so that little more than the outline eif his gilt can lie published. “It is known, however, that he docs not propose to ask from Congress a single foot of iauel upon which the university buildings will be constructed. Tlie entire expense is to be borne out of bis endow- > ment. No site lias yet been selected. It will, however, necessarily l>c very large, in it is proposed to erect a series of magi ficient structures. “The amount of money to be given by Mr. Carnegie equals tlie sum of the pre sent endowment fund of Harvard and is considerably more than the invested fund of Yale. With tlie Catholic University, the .Methodist University and the pro posed Carnegie University Washington will be tlie educational center of the country.” The only cloud on the republican sky is the recommendation of Mr. Roosevelt in regard to reciprocity with Cuba. Tlie President lias said that from moral rea sons and national interest we are bound to grant material concessions to Cuba. Tlie- Sugar Trust has promised to add the gentle weight of its persuasive influence to the movement, always provided that there is no reduction on refined sugar, which, of course, means that the Cuban raw sugar can be bought cheaper by the trust but the consumer will have to pay just as much for the refined article, and Senator Lodge has been chosen to lead the light in the Senate The* State- Boarel of Health at its month ly meeting discussed measures to prevent the spread of tuberculosis. Jlcklng Joints In I'Ve fingers, toes, arms, and other parts of the body, are joints that are inflamed and swollen by rheumatism— that acid condition of tlie blood width affects the also. Sufferers dread to move, especially after sitting or lying long, and their condition is common!) - worse in wet weather. “It has been a long time since we have been without Hood's Sarsaparilla. My fattier thinks .he could not do witnout it. He has been troubled with rheumatism since he was a boy. and Hood's Sarsapa rilla is-the only meeP.cine-.he can take that will enable him to take Ids place in the field.” Miss Ada Doty, Sidney, lowa.
