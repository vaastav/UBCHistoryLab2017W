COLUMBIA. Thursday Horning, Deo. 7, 1865. Unhappy Poland. "Thc Borlin correspondent of the London Times informs us that amongst the other woes heapod on unhappy Poland, thc Czar is about to add the merciless Russian cin seription. It was this which two years Ago produced the robellion in that coun? try, just crushed with such terrible severi? ty. Now that the spirit of the nation is broken, now that Poland is completely subjugated, the Czar designs calling upon that down-trodden people for their quota ?duo the Kassian army bet?re the late re? bellion-75,000 men. This will bo an ex? hausting drain upon a little nation of not jmorc than 5,000,000 of people, who have g?roVably lost in the late war-by exile, by ?6oI??cal execution and transportation and flight of rebels-as many men as uki ??ha^e made up the numbers originalb due :ihe armies of thc Czar. And now, after all the sufferings they have gone through, when so much of the best blood of their .nation Jias been spilt in the field ?>r on the scaffold, whilst many of Poland's fair ?.laughters .and leading patriots arc lan sreishing in Russian fortresses or perish? ing on the bleak steppes of Siberia, comes 'this fearful visitation-thc Russian con ascription-carried out with a rigor and severity nowhere equalled. It was done on the 5th ultimo, and well 1 way the London Times, correspondent say it was "a fatal day to many a Polish ;md?bor and bride." It sweeps the whole country. "Only the higher nobility and the scanty compliment of professional men left since the rebellion aro left. Artisans, ..mechanics, merchants, peasants, all go. The .writer .goes on to say, that "families vatjj.fc,faave particularly distinguished them? selves by their loyalty during the late jre'bp'Kion arc alse rcleasod from all service, ito whatever class of society they may belong." Poor, unhappy, down-trodden leland, tho land of Koskiusco and of Pulaski 1 You are bound hand and foot tn the power of thc oppressor, your strug -glee for freedom have been useless-you j.rc a conquered nation and yon writhe in "vain. That deep, deadly, inveterate hatred you bear thoso Russian battalions, far ?bitterer than ever gleamed from the dark ceyefi Italians upon thc white-coated Aus ?ra'in soldiers, is of no avail. The heel of 'tho tyrant is on you, and you must submit So foreign misrule. In tho grasp of the immense Ituosia, with its million of sol ?'liery, with your claws cut, your teeth .extracted, you are as powerless aa a child." The writer thus describes the draft: ."Imagine the men walking up to tho fcerrTbie table, and you have a spectacle in tsomparison to which Hamburg, with all ?A?! sordid anxieties and cowardly suicides, to nothing but a frivolous caricature. The .?election of the nien, the redemption of the rich, and the gambling ordeal and Anal enlistment of the poor, require no less than a mouth to decide." As soon ns the draft commences, many ?-.ikc to thc woods, many try to fly the country, but a strong military cordon is established on the frontiers, and the pant? ing fugitive that falls into their net is at ?J once taken, without hope of escape. Of .coarse the examining boards, in so notori? ously corrupt a country as Bussia, make .enormous profits. Frequently, however, -after a conscript has passed a Government ?otteer, he is seized in the dead of night *n<] lodged in jail to undergo another inspect ion by medical men brought from a neighboring town for tho purpose. So of ?soarse the poor fellow is pretty generally .stripped before ho gets through. Poor unhappy Poland, over since, as a boy, (says the Richmond Times,) wo read "Thaddeus of Warsaw," of your noble stragglers for independence, of tho fall of *b.e gallant Pulaski, at Savannah, in our -defence, our heart has been with you in all yonr unavailing efforts of right against saight, your sufferings as a subjugated, down-trodden people. lt is believed that the circus companies will be deterred from any further attempts ai "Bill Arp's" idea of reconstruction, as ?bey are having such ill lu;k. A short time'ago, the steamer Quaker City was .caught in a severe gale off Hatteras, and it wa? found necessary to throw overboard several horses belonging to Stone A- Bos? ton's circus company, it is now stated that the steamer Catharine Whiting, from New York to New Orleans, was picked up at sea, in a disabled condition, und towed into South-west Pass. Nixon's circus troupe, who were eu route for Texas, and passengers, lost overboard all their trained horses and a large portion of their tent equipage._ Tho Augusta Constitutionalist learns that quite a number of plantations in that vicinity have changed hands lately, the {purchasers being mostly parties from thc 3ke-j.li. I _ Message of SOT. Orr. We publish in our supplement, this morning, the first message of GOT. Orr to tho Legislature. He makes several im? portant suggestions, which we hope will rocoive the due consideration of our legis? lators. Thc President's Message. We learn that the tone of the President's Message is most favorable. The tele? graphic synopsis states that a State can? not commit treason; that acts of secession aro null and void; that when a State has passed the Constitutional amendment, it only remains for her to send members to Congress. It also states that Government cannot make electors of freedmen-that matter being reserved to thc States them? selves; that Government can only see that they are protected in person and property. The telegram does not clearly indicate thc foreign policy of the Government. We will, in all probability, receive tho messace in full in a day or two, and will immediately lay it before our readers. 

CONFEDERATE DEAD BURIED NEAR WIN? CHESTER.-We trust that the following cir? cular, which we find in the Winchester papers, will meet with a hearty and mate? rial rospouse throughout the country: "To THE PEOPLE OK THE SOUTH.-The re? cent battles around Winchester, Virginia, I have left their traces in the many graves i scattered broad cast over an area of twelve i miles radius. The dead wero generally buried where they foll, and their rude j graves are fast disappearing beneath th? I feet of men and beasts, free, from the want of enclosures, to go where they will. "Those who died in the hospitals were mostly buried in the old Episcopal grave? yard, but its enclosures have long boen destroyed, and cattle graze over its whole extent". "The farming operations of next season, thc wear of the winter, and the disappear? ance, by removal and death, of those who were present at their burials, will, in a few months, leave ne knowledge of tho resting place of many martyred dead. "Impelled by these considerations, some of the citizens of Winchester and vicinity 1 have determined to endeavor to collect I these scattered remains in one cemetery, ? and surround them by a substantial en- I closure. This, of course, will require a considerable amount of monev. The moans i of our citizens are very much diminished by the war and its results; wo are, there? fore, induced to appeal to you for aid in this matter, encouraged by the belief that you will feel >t a privilege, as well as a duty, to pay this tribute of respect to the memory of those who fell in your cause. "Every Southern State has its represen tative among these fallen heroes; we ask ! all, then, for such contributions as they feel able to give. "Should we succeed in raising tho neces? sary funds, it is proposed to remove the remains on the 1st of April, 1866; and we would respectfully suggest to all whose friends lie under these battle- fields, to dis? inter them by that time if they wish to do so. In the removal, every precaution will bc taken to preserve all means of identifi? cation, and an accessible record

The hirer agreed, in writing, to convey to tho substitute a tract of land, for which snit was brought. Chancellor Steele, of Ten? nessee, has annulled the contract. Ho declares that the recognition of the Con? federates as belligerents was induced by considerations of humanity, and in no wiso invested thc "so-called" with rights of nationality. Hence contracts made in contemplation of the existence of such Government, in obedience torts exactions, and to promote its ends, are in derogation of public morals and law, and arc void. -? During a trial of a defaulting Govern? ment agent, in Mobile, the important fact was elicited, that of 1)0,000 bales of forfeit? ed Confederate cotton not one-tenth has ever been accounted for to the Govern? ment. Thc remainder, worth fully $15,000, 000, have been appropriated by official and non-official rascals and sharpers. I The San Antonio AVvr.s, of the 4th inst., j says of the departure for New Orleans Of I Judge Devine, late Confederate Distriet 1 Judge, Colonel bucket, who commanded j the Third Texas Infantry, late Confederate j States Army, in the Trans-Mississippi De I partment, and Major S. Maclin, late Com j missarv Confederate States Army, in tho I same Department, that "they were under I orders from General Sheridan," and adds: .one of the gentlemen said to us that 'thc e.l'<t of their trial' was their connec? tion with thc seizure of United States pro? perty in this city in the carly part of 1861, under direction of the State Convention and the Committee of Public Safety; mote particularly with reference to the taking by State troops of 330,600 United States funds, received here from New Orleans subsequent to the general seizure."

CEASE FIBING AT THAT OFFICSH.-Tho Montgomery, Alabama, Mail, dwelling upon the fact (hat Southerners generally prefer their soldiers to represent them in Congress and elsewhere, says: "To vote for such men is not to hnr' de? fiance at thc conqueror, but rather to exorcise thc privilege of co nphmenting gallant men, without a thought whether it may or may not please thc conqueror. The true conqueror is nut only devoid of jealousy, but is willing t<> share his meal and couch with the vanquished. He has learned t > honor bia prisoner from the ole-'ric sympathy which is always gene? rated by bullets and bayonets. "At Rich Mountain, a gallant South Ca? rolinian, in command of a section of artil? lery, had fought his guns well, until he liad not men left to work them. Our lines were broken, and the enemy was dashing upon him. A shell dismounted one of his pieces, killed his horse under bim, and shattered his right arm. Gaining his feet, the gallant fellow mounted his re? maining gun, and standing erect as it dashed away under a shower of bullets, shook his sword at the enemy with his left hand. Just at this moment, an order came sharp and clear from the Federal line, "Cease firing at that officer!'' Such a spectacle of ardent valor drew a sponta? neous shout of applause even from his mortal foe. As it was then, so will it bo hereafter. Wher. the fanatics of the North abuse the men who considered it their duty to obey the mandate of their State, an universal shout will como from the true Union men of the North, "Cease firing at that officer'' " Cot'NTEUFEiTiNti.-A largo number of counterfeiters of United States currency wero captured in Philadelphia last week, and the most conclusive evidenco against them discovered. At thc examination be? fore the United States Commissioner, the following significant circular, found at the house of one of them, (its subscriber,) in Montgomery Comity, Pennsylvania, was produced as testimony: MYSTIC CIBC?LAR.

Many of the applications for pardon are endorsed by our own Generals and Senators.-Coi: Philadelphia Press. FROM MEXICO.-The Mexican Republi? cans on the Ric Grande frontier had made no further attack on Matamoros up to thc 19th November. It is said that * wo thousand Freneh and Austrian troops to reinforce the imperial garrison there, had arrived at the mouth of the river. From New Orleans we are again furnished with a despatch which in different dress has been made to do service at least twice before by tho telegraphers in New York. It states that two republican boats from tho American shore of thc Rio Grande at? tempted an attack on thc imperial steamer Antonio, which tired upon and sunk them, killing or drowning, as is supposed, all on board. Evidently this is the same ntory, in a new shape, which was received from New Orleans and published lately. It has been intimated that tho craft taken by tho imperialists for a republican flotilla were merely American woo * boats. An agree? ment h .s been entered into between Gen. Weitzel and Mejia, that the Matamoros Ranchero shall cease to publish articles insulting to our soldiers and people, and that our soldiers on the Rio Grande shall refrain from insults to the imperialists across the river. Capt. Judkins, of the Cunard line of ocean steamers, lias crossed the. Atlantic five hundred times in the service of the com? pany, and now proposes to quit seafaring. Tjiooal Items.

The House of Representatives suspended busi? ness, yesterday, until Friday, at ll a. m. 

SOUTHERN PUBLISUINO HOUSE.- WO have received from Messrs. Townsend A North a copy of a book from the publishing house of Messrs. Wm. B. Smith A Co., Raleigh, N. C., entitled "Nameless," by Mrs. Fanny Murdough Downing. The book is gotten up in very neat style, but as to its literary merits wo are unable to speak, having only tad time to give it a casual glance. We will notice it more fully hereafter. Messrs. T. A N. havo also favored us with a copy of the "Musical Host," for December, a monthly publication which is highly spoken of by musical amateurs. They have on hand a variety of other new and useful books, to an inspection of which the}- in? vite thc public generally.

" " -10-4 Sheeting. " " -Long Cloths. " " -Shoes. A. M. Shipp-WofTord College. Spartanbnrg Female College, Tho Washington correspondent of tho Cincinnati Gazette-a radical Republican newspaper-is responsible for the fol? lowing: "Thc Treasury Department is plagued to tho very last with tin; cotton question. Every agent sent down is straightway washed out of sight at the Department under the flood of charges against his ho? nesty. 'I know I sent some honest men down there,' said v the Secretary, in de? spair, the other day; 'but it looks very much as if none of them could stay so long.' It has been admitted over and over again, of late, that it would have been about as profitable-and in other respects much more desirable-for thc Govern? ment to havo abandoned tho whole cotton claim, and left the rebel cotton in the hands of whoever happened to havo pos? session of it when the rebellion ended. As it is, tho charges of corruption are inter? minable, and the vexation is infinite." INTERNAI. REVENTES.-The Journal of Commerce (money market) says: We learn from reliable authority that the Commiajioners appointed to propose a revision of the revenue laws have so far advanced in their labors that they can speak very encouragingly of the futuro in this rcsocct. The Commissioners will bc prepared to recommend a closer imitation of h\e best portions of the general Euro? pean systems where heaw taxation has become a science, and will endeavor to condense tho burden, selecting a few items for assessment, rather than spread it over all tho products of the country in smaller measure ai a grcjv?y increased cost and trouble. If this is done judiciously, and incomes are released altogether from taxa? tion, the system would doubtless be much more tolerable, and yield a larger total of collectable revenue. SICK AND WEARY OF IT.-The editor of the New York Tribune is thoroughly sick and disgusted with the- cry for blood of his radical associates. He says: "How weary we aro of death-doing! How perfecth hateful this gallows appears, shadowing the foreground of the brightest future America has ever seen! How revolt? ing to be told that this gallows is to bc tho only response to the loyalty of America! How sad tho present gall.;-.v-scanJain will appear to our children, as they turn over the leaves of living historv, and find thc greatest achievements of Christendom side, by side with the squabbling of polico de? tectives over a condemned, helpless crimi? nal, and Chinese tricks with the bodies of dead men!" "ONE OF THE WITNESSES."-It is stated that one of the witnesses who testified to individu! killing and murder during the trial of Wirz, was appointed to o?ice in ono of the Government departments at Washington upon recommendation of thc military commission, and that subsequent? ly tho man was dismissed on charges niaCo by thc officers and men of the Seventh New York regiment, because of his deser? tion of the service and general unreliabili? ty. If this be true, it will serve to add to tho horrid doubt which many have enter? tained in rogard to much of the testimony brought out on the Wirz case. Maximilian, in a speech made last Sep? tember, said. "I may die, but I will die at the foot of our glorious banner, for no hu? man force can make mo abandon thc post to which your confidence has called me.'
