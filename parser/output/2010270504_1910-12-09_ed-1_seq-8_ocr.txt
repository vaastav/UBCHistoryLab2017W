Taxpayers arc prone to complain of their tax assessment, in iaci nicy kick wh tlher tho levy Is high or low, and only one out of a hundred will atop to consider the benefit he receives in return for tho taxes ho pnyo. Tako for oxam pie, a North Platte resident, such as this writer. In payment of his personal tax for 1910 ho found that tho total stuto and county tax was $14. CO, the total city tax $17 20, tho total school tax $22.80 nnd tho poll tax $2.00. It will bo observed that tho highest Item is that for schools, nnd practically in ovory town and precinct in Lincoln county It will bo found that this item leads the othors. In North Platte it costs $20 per pupil per year to educate our children, so that the man who hns thrto children In school can figuro that tho cost to the school district for edu cating his three children is $00 per year. How many of us nay $60 por year taxes for tho support of the schools)? Isnt It evident tho more wealthy men or tho men without children are helping to educate the children of nine-tenths of tho tox-payors? Then why complain of your school tax, you pcoplo who have children In school? Tho next highest item in the Hat is city tax. In return for this wo have fire protection, police protection, sewer systom, electrically lightod streets, good streets and crosswalks, all of which aro beiroflt or convenience or both. Would you do without thoso for tho sum they cost you? We Milnk not; if wo did not have theso conveniences you would holler your head off. Tho combined county and stnto tax is just about one-fourth of the total paid by a North Platte citizen. This tux maintains Our statu Institutions, our courts, our stnto and county officials, keepj up highways In road districts, maintains our bridges, meets election expenses, takes care of our poor who need aid, nnd defrays other oxpenscs, all of which aro absolutely necossaryin o der that wo may enjoy tho benefits ol' an advanced civilization. And when you think of these things, do you really think you hnvo a kick n-comlng? Taxes in Lincoln county may bo u shade higher than in somo other counties, but the bigness of the county makes ex penses high. Wo havo forty-throe pre cincts moro than twice the number in the averago county In tho oast part of the state. This makes our elections expensive; It costs u big sum to make tho assessment; tho county is bo largo that the mllonge charge of n juror or a wI'ncBS attending court Is often greater than his court foes; wo havo twice the number of miles of road ns has tho nv eriugo county and thoso must bo main tained; we havo eight or ten bridges across tho Platto rivors that must be kopt in repair; in fact our county Is so big and so comparatively spnrsoly set tled that we really ought to congratuluto our Ralvqs thntour taxes nro not hlghor. History of Red Cross Seals. Tho Red Cross Christmas seals that aro now on sale at many of tho stores In North Platto dnto bnck in thoir or igin to "jhnrity stnmps" first used for the soldiers' rcllof funds in Boston in 1802, during tho Civil War. After the war, this method of raising monoy was discontinued In this country for a gen eration, although it found vogue In Portugal, Switzerland Australia, Franco, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Russia Swe den and other European countries, There nro now several hundred differ ent types of charity stamps used in all parts of the world. Stamps St seals were first used to got monoy for tho anti-tuberculosis crusade in Norway and Sweden In 1904. After being used in theso countries for tnreo years, as a direct result of tho in to rent of Jacob Riis in this movement, tho Dulowaro Anti-Tuberculosis As sociation, headed by Miss Emily P. Hlsiell, and tho Rod Cross Socloty of Delewaro combined In Issuing u Tuber culosis Stamp. So successful was this campaign that nearly $3,000 wns ro- auzeu. anu tno next yonr, in iuua, tho American Rod Cross was induced to issue a National Red Cross Tuberculosis Stamp. From this snlo $1113.000 was realized, that amount being almost doubled in lPOi). This veur for thollr.it time, tho snlo Is organized on a compre hensive basis, taking in nil parts of me united mates. A million tor tub berculosin work la confidently expected. Crop Value. Nothing short of omniscience can srasn tho valuo of the farm urn. ducts of this year, Is tho statement of me secretary or agriculture in his an nual report of 1910 published Wednna. day. At no time boforo in thu world's history has n country produced farm products within ono yenr with n valuo reaching $8,920,000,000, which is tho valuo of tho agricultural products of this country for 1910. Tho value of farm product)! from 1899 to tho present year nnsuoon progressive without inter ruption. If the valuo of products In 1899 la placed at 100. the value of this year Is 189, or almost double tho valuo eleven years ago, "During this period of unexampled agricultural production, a period of twolvo years, during which the farmers of this country nave sicauuy nuvanceain property nnr and wealth and In economic in indenun. donee, nn intelligence, and a knowledge of agriculturo, tho total valuo of farm prouuets 10 $7l,UUO,Uu0,UOQ," Bllineer Vindicated. Tho BalllnKor-Pinchntt Investigating committee, after cloven months' work, made its final report to both houses of congress Wednesdny.

President Taft submitted his mes sage to congress Tuesday. The prin cipal features aro: Ha declares it Is time to stop legis lating with reference to regulation of corporations and to witness the ef fect, of a vigorious execution of the laws already on tho statute books. The exact limitation upon business meth ods imposed by law will doubtless be made clearer by pending decisions of the supremo court. Just nt this time, the president says, ho believes the activities of tho gov ernment, in addition to enforcement of the laws should bo directed toward economy of adminstration, the enlarge ment of opportunities for foreign trade, tho building up of homo Industry and the strengtning of confidence of capital In domostlc Investment. Mr. Taft recommends strongly somo form of ship subsidy to incrcaso Amor lean shipping, especially to South America. The tariff board is not ready to sub mit a report of any of tho schedules of tho Payne law, and Mr. Taft says, ho ho will not recommend any tariff leg islation until tho new congress con venes In December 1911. He urges Mint tho tariff board be modo permanent and that all future re visions be mado schedule by schedule He vigoriously opposes another general revision. The Panama canal should bo fortified. An appropriation of $19,000,000 is rec ommended for this purposo. There must bo no moro "pork barrel" methods in river and harbor nnd public building bills. The latter should be based upon tho report of n' commission of experts. In tho past congress has appropriated too much for buildings not needed nnd not enough for buildings badly needed. Recommendation for anti-Injunction and federal incorporation laws are re newed. It is proposed that second class mail rates shall bo readjusted no as tochargo mngazincs a much higher rate on their advertising tactions. Strong representations nro mado for tho establishment of a new bnnking and currency systom. Two now battleship and soveral aux iliary vessels aro urged for tho navy. Tho president recommends thnt coal liosphato nnd oil lands and water power sites bo disposed of in the fu ture uy leasing. Estimates for tho government ox-1 penuitures uuring tno next liBcal year Iiavo been cut to $630,013.12, which is $52,001,887.00 less than tho actual ap propriations for tho current year. Tho estimated receipts for tho noxt fiscal yenr aro $080,000,000. The President urges tho extension of tho civil scrvico principle to tho diplo matic and consular corps and tho ac quisition by the government of resi dences nnd of offices for its diplo matic officers, Somo criticisms of tho Payno tariff act aro just, Bays the president, but moro aro unfounded. Thore should bo moro officers for tho nrmy. Tho engineering corpso should be increased by Blxty. Tho fortifications nt Correcrldor island. Manila bay nnd nt Pearl harbor, Ha waii, should bo hurried to early com- iciion. In rcenrd to tho Panama canal tho president sayB: "Tho progress of tho work is most satisfactory. It will bo comploted woll within tho tlmo set, January 1, 1916, and within tho estim mated coat of $375,000,000. Tho slides in Culcbra cut olfer no great reason for iieiay," Tho stupendous volume of agricultural products, amounting to S8.020.000.000 this year, Indicntes a good prospect for uusincss tnrouguout the country. Tho present census promises to be the best over taken, but is not perfect. Tho census padders aro to be vigorously prosecuteu. A bureau of health should bo estab lished.

Tho renort of tho stnto railroad com mission confirms tho o-onarnt under standing that no radical legislation Is needed to carry on tho policy of rail road regulation in Nobruskn. Nino flfltpYllin rr Mia nvlatlnr 1 n i nnlnnln rwl to sustain tho spirit of tho existing law whoro defects havo been found, aro asked for. Repeal of a joker in ino anti-pass act is requested, t'owir to require eaual facllltloa for nil In other linos of shipping than grain, for iiiauuicu atone quarries, is another roasonnblo roquest. Authority to al low frco flhlnmen: of tho hnnsnhnlil goods of railroad employes moved from placo to nloco. as frco norsonal tinns- portatlon la now allowed, Is also asked for.
