ALEXANDRIA, VA. FRIDAY, DECEMBERS. The defalcation in'the Treasury Depart uieut, iu the ease of .Marden, mentioned it) yesterday's Gazette, has developed other frauds of heavy sums of money, aud the books show that hy meaoa of abstraction at different periods, within about two years, an amount of over $50,000 has been stolen from the government in tho cash room of the Treasury, the offenders being Marden and Seth Johnson, interest teller. The discovery of Mardeu's guilt led the way to the discovery ot Johnson's crime. The latter, it is said, has beeu dealiug in gold aud stock speculations,and has beeu losing for some time. There docs not seem to have beeu any roll union between the two, and it appears that neither knew of the crime of the other. Mardoti and Johnson hare both beeu arrested. it is uow sajd that "Senator Trumbull states that he knows nothing whatever of the account of an alleged interview with him on the presidential question, as published in the Louisville fYmrior-Journal. and widely copied in the papers. Nothiug of the kind, according to his recollection, ever took plaiv. The account represented him as giviug his adhesion to Grant for re-election." Most of the aecouuts of "interviews" with prominent meu. are now generally considered as "lying bulletins. A number ot the Radical Senators learning that Mr. Fish contemplated retiring iroui the State Department, united in a letter urgently requesting him to remain, and stating that this wftpi aK- -v Ktr mom Kara nf tlia I 'a Vi icquc^l vwao ul.>/ mi ^vu m; iucuimm ' v? v inet and leading member.9, of both Houses of Congress, Forty-five Senators sigued the letter.

The Court decided that two of the * eleven counts were good, that six were bad, and on three counts the Court wore divided. ? The inotiou to quash was overruled. The Republican' meetings tu England have recently boeu disturbed by confusion and disorder by many of those present at them. But the significant thing is that these meetingi are openly held largely attended, and that the speakers at them are bold and determined, at least, in their language. A few years ago the government would not have permitted these meetiugs. in reference to a suggestion in the 1'resident's Message,the Washington Patriot says: -i- in a criminal prosecution against an American citizen for owning an estate with slaves in Cuba, where is the jury to o>?ui<' from?
