MESSAGE THIS WILL BE KEYNOTE OF CON GRESSIONAL ACTION. THERE'S HARD WORK AHEAD . i Defeated Membero May Make Path of President's Program Extremely Difficult. Washington When congtess meets noxt week It will have threo months In which to perform whatever may be the demands of n republican admlnts- tratloh. After thut tho futo of the Taft legislative program will depend upon the will of a democratic house and a republican eenato, a condition which Will conttnuo until the end of Presi dent Taft's present term.

Many of tho regular republicans de feated In the recent elections are not expected to carry with the best of grace the blows so harshly adminis tered, and this fact of Itself gives the president a task offering difficulties fnr moro complex than any that have been presented to nn executive within years, Realizing that ho will bo criticized If ho falls to demand of congress fur ther rdvlslon of tho tariff especially of the wool and woolen schedule and fully cognizant of tho fact that tho prospects would be all against tho success of sucn a program If sub mitted, tho prcsldont.
