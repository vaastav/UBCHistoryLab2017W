!f5^!9$^SSS^S! HIS ANNUAL MESSAGE Synopsis of the President's Rec ommendations to Cungress. Dt Toaehea Upon Many Important Quentlona Amonff Them irnxu, Irrigation Worlc«» ltthminu Canal and Other Tblnii». The following Is a brief synopsta of President Roosevelt's message to con* gress, giving a resume of his comments and recommendations upon the topics of greatest Interest to the American people: The message opens with an official no tice of the death of the late President Mclvinley, and a eulogy of him in which the president says "It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley's death he was the most widely-loved man in all the United States, while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter ani mosities Incident to public life. His po litical opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature* the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close asso ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender affec tions and home virtues which are all important In the makeup of national character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the union, he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate Of home relations. There could he no personal hatred of him, for he never act ed with aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or private life. The defenders of those mur derous criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is exer cised for political ends inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power. But .for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged." In the same connection he recommends legislation for dealing with anarchy, recommending a law that will permit the federal courts to handle any man guilty of taking or attempting to take the life of the chief magistrate or any person in the line of succession to the presidency. Another is for a law that will prevent the preaching or teaching of anarchistic doctrines within our boundaries, and another is for one that will prevent the landing upon our shores of any person with anarchistic tenden cies. Tlie Trust*. He deals with the trust probl\i at con siderable length, citing both the advan tages and disadvantages of these great corporations to the nation. He does not attribute their rise to the existence of a protective^tariff. but to natural causes that operate in other countries as well as our own He claims that to them the nation owes much of its present degree of prosperity and commercial and industrial advance ment that it is the great corporations who have driven the railroads across the continent, and made us a world power in the markets of the world. He asks for legislation that will control and regulate them, but at the same time counsels congress to act with caution in enacting such legislation, and1 assigns a number of reasons lor the necessity for caulion. and of this problem he says: "The process lias aroused much antago nism, a great part of which is wholly without wairant It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On ihe contrary, never be fore has the average man, the wage wot ker, the f»imer. the small trader, been so well If sis HI this country and at the present lime There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth, yet it remains true that a for tune accumuiaieri in legitimate business can .be accumulated by the person spe cially benefited only on condition of con ferring immense incidental heuetits upou otherb. Successful enterprise, uf the type which benefits all mankind can only ex ist if the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of .success." "Aftilic.ial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or oilier associations de pending upon nny statutory law for their existence ot privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and lull and accuiaie information sis to their operations should he made public regu larly sit reasonable intervals" Among his reasons for caution he em fihast/.es the fad that, in whatever legis lation is enacted it should nol. any fur ther than can he avoided. luimpHt- the .strong and Iorcetul men upon whom (he success of business operations Inevitably I'e&ts. Another of his reasons for caution is to be found in the international commercial conditions of to day as the same business conditions which have-produced the great aggregations of corporate and individual Wealth have made them very potent fac tors in international commercial compe tition. As we have only just begun to as sume that commanding position in the in ternational business world which we be lieve will be more and- more ours. It is of the utmost importance that this position be not jeopardized at the present time. "Under such conditions it would be most Unwise to ciamp or fetter the youthful Strength of the nation." But while ite recognizes these conditions as .reasons (or caulion in enacting trust legislation, he believes there are evils which nerd Vie remedied, and believes, also that remedies may be applied which will rot hamper our present position Of the evils he considers overcapital ization the worsts and of the remedy for these evils he says: "The first »ssent!al in determining how to deal with the great industrial com binations is knowledge of the facts publicity. Tn the interest of the public the government should have the right to Inspect .and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in inter state business Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only he determined after publicity has been obtained by process of law and in the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and complete —knowledge which may be made public to the world "The' large corporations, commonlv called trusts, though organized in one state, always do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated There Is utter lack of uniformity in the state laws- about them, and as no state has any exclusive interest In or power over their acts it has in practice proved im possible to get adequate regulation through state action. Therefore in the Interest of the whole people the nation should, without interfering with the pow er of the states In the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regula tion over all corporations doing an inter state business. This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some mononolistic element or tendency in Its business. There would be no hardship in such supervision. Banks are subject to It, and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Tndeed it Is probable that supervision of corpora tions by the national government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a state as Massachusetts in order to produce excellent results." The president believes that it will be possible to secure the needed remedies for the trust evil under tho constitution as it now exists, but if congress thinks otherwise he recommends that a constitu tional amendment be subm tted tnat will coi fer the po are* necessary. In connection with the trusts he rec ommends legislation creating a cabinet of ficer. to be kpown t»s secretary of vm Tic.ce. whoue di ties woul be to deal with nil riu stions concern'/* commcrce, later and the tnffhant marine Chinese Exclusion Necessary He recommends the Immediate reen actment of the Chinese exclusion act as a necessary protection for American work men, and in the same connection recom mends such amendments to the Interstate commerce law as will enable the various states to protect their laborers from the competition of prison labor of another state, and also that the government aid the movement for the bettering of the worklngmen's condition by not permitting women or children to work excessive hours or at night upon goods made for government use. He asks for amendments to the immi gration laws that will prevent the land ing of undesirable immigrants, and such as will enable the immigrant officials to apply severer tests both mentally, moral ly and physically to those who seek a landing upon our shores. The Tariff, He counsels against any change in the ?ion resent tariff laws, but urges the adop of the reciprocity idea as a means of opening the doors of the world to our commerce. In this connection he says: "Every application of our tariff policy to roeei.?ur shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover ti difference between to* labor cost here ai. abroad. The well 4»s»3ts&i§! ... being of the is? a .me consid eration of our eutiio policy of economic legislation. "Subject to this proviso of the proper protection nectssary to our industrial well being at home the principle of rv i procity must command our hearty sup port. The phenomenal growth of oui export trade emphasizes the urgcncy or the need for wider markets and for a lib eral policy in dealing with foreign na tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex atious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoid* d. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the lung run directly or indirectly pur chase those surplus products by giving us something in return. Their ability to pur chase our products should as far as pos sible be secured by so arranging our tar iff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm, to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. "1 ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my pieuecessur." He urgfs the adoption of a policy that will ri-sult In the upbuilding of our mer chant marine to meet the dtmands of our expanding commerce, but retrains from making any definite recommendations as to what this policy shall be. He also urges the enactment of such financial legislation as will better safe guard against the deranging influences of commercial crises and financial panics* and such as will make the currency of the country more responsive to the demands of domestic trad'e and commerce. He points out the fact that the receipts from duties on exports and internal taxes far exceed the government's expenditures, but counsels against a reduction that will cause a deficit, and in the same connection urges a strict economy in expenditures so far as our national needs will permit. Interstate Commerce. He comments upon the complaints en tered against the management of the rail ways for their alirgtd discrimination in the matter of freight rates against the small shippers and certain localities, and says: "The act should be amended. The rail way is a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to it that within its jurisdiction this is so and should provide a speedy, inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the develop ment and operation of these commercial agencies." frrig tlon, A considerable portion of the.message Is given to the subject of irrigation lor the arid lands ot the west, and he urges govern ment assistance in perfecting a system of irrigation that will reclaim these waste lants and make them habitable for set tlers. He bel'ieves the government should virtually control the water rights of the streams affording the water for-Irrigation purposes, and should construct reservoirs for this purpose. Of this he says: "The government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow of streams the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow. The Colonies. He advocates reciprocal trade relations for Cuba that will afford that island a market for her products, and urges this on the grounds of morality and national interest. For the Philippines he recommends much in the way of legislation, but again counsels caution in the enactment of it. He says we cannot leave the islands at the present time, but that it is our duty to give to the Filipinos such an administra tion as will fit them for self-government in the future. He desires such legisla tion as will permit of the granting of franchises in the islands and so develop the natural resources of the group, and says ot this necessity for development: "Not to permit this Is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchises must be granted and the business permitted only und*er regulations which will guarantee the islands against any kind of improper ex ploitation. But the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed, and the capital willing to develop it must be given the opportunity. The field must be thrown open to individual enterprise, which has been the real factor in the development of every region over which our flag has flown. It Is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general transportation, mining, banking, currency, homesteads and the use and ownership of the lands and timber. These laws will give free play to Industrial-enterprise, and the commercial development which will surely follow will afford to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them." He also urges the Immediate construc tion of a Pacific cable to connect Hawaii and the Philippines with this country as a commercial, political and military ne cessity. The iMthmlnn Canal. He comments upon the necessity for the immediate construction of an isth mian waterway, and says the way has been prepared lor its construction by the conclusion of a now treaty with Kngland on the subject. Of the new treaty recently concluded with Kngland he says: "I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotia tions on this subject with Great Britain, conducted dn both sides in a spirit of friendliness and mutual good will and re spect, have resulted in my being able to lay before the senate a treaty which if ratified will enable us to begin preparations for an isthmian canal at any time nrd which guarantees to this nation every right that It has ever asked in connection with the canal. In this treaty the old Clayion lJulwer treaty, so long recognized as in adequate to supply the base for the con struction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, is abrogated. It spe cially provides that the United Sialr-s alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms' of equality without the euarantee nr interference of any outside nation from any quar ter The signed treaty will at once he laid before the senate, and If ap proved the congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it sorurrs us by providing for the building of the canal." The Army anil Navy. For the navy he recommends a con tinued increase in ships as in keeping with our place as a first class power among the nations of the world He also recommends an increase in the officers and men of the navy, that the ships now building may he placed in commission as soon as completed, without retiring any of the old ones. He urges this ns a means of performing our international duties as Well as a safeguard for our In ternational rights. He believes that all of our ships should be kept in commlss-ion as a means of training officers and men for times of emergency. Of the army he says there Is* no need of an increase but recommends the es tablishment of a staff department and a system by which there may be an elim ination, grade by grade, of those who seem unfit to render efficient service In the next grade. He also recommends the reduction of the "paper work" of the army, known commonly as army "red tape," and espe cially for the army In the field'. Tn the same connection he recommends the adop tion of new militia laws which will rec ognize the national guard of the several states and place them upon an equal foot ing with the army when called Into the government service, by which the obliga tions and duties of both shall be the same, as well as the equipment and discipline. Civil Service. He asks for such legislation as will place the employes-of the District of Columbia In the classified service, and also the em ployes In the insular service. Among other recommendations It one asking for legislation that will Improve the consular service one that will cease to recognize Ihe Indian as a member of a tribe hut as an Individual, and a distribu tion of the tribal funds. For the Indian* he also asks for the establishment of In dustrial school* and the stopping of the Issue of rations He asks aHberal appro priation for the loulstana Purchase expo sition and an appropriation to cover the expense of transferring the government exhibits at lluftalo to the exposition at fTharlPstnn. which the Charleston exposi tion has paid Another recommendation is for a per manent census bureau, which, he says, would Insure better, cheaper and mors satisfactory work in that department. The Postal Service. He calls attention to the growth of ths postal service, and points to the fact that ihe deficit of Ihe service has been re duced to the comparatively small sum of $3,923,727 This he says could be still fur ther reduced, and possibly a surplus shown, but for the fact that many pub lications are now securing the pound rate as second class matter wWh are not law fully entitled to the san.e. but that the department has now undertaken to re move the abuses so far as possible by a stricter application of the law. and asks that it be tustalned In Its effort. He calls attention to the settlement of the Chinese difficulties, and our part In the work, and says that China has prom ised reforms that will In the future guar* antee protection to foreign represents* Uve« within her boundaries. ^WK^ys- ,?s*"' s' :.r Foreign Editors Comment on Presi dent's Message. Crtticlnm on tile Wliole IM Rattier Fa­ vorable— Position on (lit- Canal Question Jiot ItrKiinlnl mm Cause for Apprehension. London, Dec. 4.—Tlie London daily papers, looking- at President lioose-' veil's message from the point of view of its literary power and the wealth of Weighty matters discusscd, regard it as one of the most characteristic and remarkable messages ever sent to con gress. At the same time the papers recognize its conservative and busi nesslike moderation and that no at tempt has been made, as the Morning Post remarks, "to strike an attitude or carry his listeners away." Somewhat Skeptical. On the whole, however, the news papers are skeptical of any great out come from the president's efforts in the direction of reform of the trusts, anti-anarchism or reciprocity, the idea being that the senate will effectually step in and prevent any great changes in the existing system. Most of (he papers remark upon the tone of exultation adopted by Presi dent Roosevelt in dealing with the canal qtiestion, but they do not show the slightest disposition to cavil thereat. The Daily Telegraph says it would have been an inconceivably disastrous blunder to have opposed America's wishes in this matter and thus driven her to build a still greater fleet than she already contemplated, which, it is safe to predict,will 20 years' hence make the United States the second sea power in the world. The Telegraph thinks that- President Roosevelt's policy is calculated rather to diminish than to increase Europe's exaggerated dread of "the American danger." No Cause for Apprehension. The Standard i9 similarly of the o-pinion that nothing in the mesrvage need in the smallest degree excite anx iety or ippreliension abroad. This pa per comments upon the president's un compromising assertion of the Monroe doctrine as somewhat unnecessary, in asmuch as there is little desire on the part of any foreign power to extend its area of militarism to the new world. Regarding President Roosevelt's spirited enunciation of Monroeism, the Chronicle says: "Whether the European nations are likely to re spect this American prohibition much longer, when the desirable colonizing grounds of the world are being snapped up in a headlong race, must depend ultimately upon the ability of the United States to en force their prohibition." The "Thunderer's" Views. The Times in an editorial on the message says it is distinguished by a clearness, firmness and reserved strength which do not require the adventitious aid of rhetorical pyro technics or popular platitudes. "We certainly have no fault to find," says the Times, "with his language to wards the British government, or in deed with his foreign policy general ly. It is not easy to see how the ex clusion policy can be enforced. The United States would to-day be poor er in many of the finer elements of its national character if an entrance, fee had been demanded of every set tler in the early days of coloniza tion." The Times thinks that re ciprocity and the trusts will prove thorny problems. In Germany. Perlin, Dec. 4.—The message of Pres ident Roosevelt caused a mild thrill in Germany. On the boerse, where it was eagerly awaited, the message was re ceived with uncommon interest and the market generally was slightly stimulated upon the posting of a bul letin containing President Roosevelt's utterances about trusts. The shares of the steamship companies fell one or two points on account of the immi gration inspection paragraph and the proposed development of the merchant marine. President Roosevelt's wordsconcern ing the restriction of immigration con tain an unpleasant suggestion in the present slate of depression, when, as the Berliner Volks Zeit.ung says, the Ijard times make an overflow of the laboring population of Europe neces sary. The free trade and liberal newspapers welcome the reciprocity recommendations, but regret that President Roosevelt did not recom mend a specific tariff reduction. The first impression of the presi dent's message in German official cir cles is that the repression of an archists by international agreement is much more likely to be carried through upon the initiative of the United States than by that of any other power. An anti-anarchist proposition from Ger many along the same lines as that of President, Roosevelt is probably al ready on ils way to the state depart ment at Washington. Taking the message altogether, it has been favorably received both pop ularly and officially. The references it contains to the late Empress Fred erick are especially appreciated. Bookkeeper Got Small Part. New York, Dec. 4.—According to the London correspondent of the World Thomas P. Goudie, the book keeper who has just been arrested on the charge of defrauding the Bank of Liverpool of at least $85,000 by means of forged checks, secured only $14, 600 as his share of the proceeds.

Dec. 4.—The attorney general's annual report to congress shows that there was an increase of 31 cases docketed during the year on the United States supreme court ap pellate docket and a decrease of three in the number disposed of, leaving 33(5 remaining on the docket at the close of the year. The number of eases actually considered by the court was 308 of which 170 were argued orally, and 15:2 submitted on printed briefs. Of the 3GS appellate cases disposed of, 132 were affirmed, 57 reversed, 57 dis missed, 24 settled by the parties in niine questions certified were an swered, and S9 were denials of peti tions for writs of certiorari under the act of March 3,1391. The report shows that, during the year there were 4,641 United States prisoners serving sentences in peni tentiaries 1,(511 were discharged dur ing the year and 1,(550 were received 41 died and 03 were pardoned.

The attorney general urges an in crease in the appropriation for a new department of justice building sug gests that congress consider the ad visability of adopting a new and uni form system of commutation with re-, spect to federal prisoners, and recom mends that the salaries of United States judges be increased. He also urges legislation defining the meth ods by Which additional testimony may be taken before the Spanish treaty claim commission of the com mission. He also recommended the establishment of an insular and ter ritorial bureau of the department of justice. THE CUBAN CAMPAIGN. MBIO'I Follower* Declare That Of ficial Interference In Elec tion In Inevitable. Havana, Dec. 4.—A cablegram signed by Eusebio Hernandez, presi dent of the democratic party, has been sent to Secretary of War Root. This message says: "The frlc-nds of Gen. BHrtolome Maso hear with grc-it satisfaction our declara tion that tile hit Interference in tlie com ing elections will not be tolerated, but un der the present arrangements Interference is Inevitable, as all members of the cen tral canvassing board are eaiulldiitcs for office and are also members of the execu tive committee of Senor Tomas Estrada Palma. One of these Is the secretary of state, and other high oflielals are also can didates. Both high and low olllelals are openly working In the interests of Senor Palma, who Is said to have the support of the United States government. The situation Is delicate and the Cuban people are alarmed nt an alleged attempt to force a president upon Hum. They ask for a fair and honest election." A delegation representing Gen. Ma so will shortly leave here for Washington to submit these facts to tlie administration and to suggest certain changes lo insure fair elec tions. Eusebio Hernando/, also rep resents the coalition of the national and independent republicans. The lower classes are enthusiastic over the candidacy of (ien. -Maso. Much feeling is being worked up against the official Cuban element, whom the Masoists claim control the election machinery.

Of the 14 cities, II went license, a gain of one over last year, the change being in Fitchburg. The. feature of the elections as a whole was the remarkable success of the repub lican party, ten mayoralty candidates of that party winning and carrying with them in nearly every instance a city council in sympathy with them. The party results were as follows: Marlboro, rep. Northampton, rep. Fall River, rep. Taunton, rep. Fitch burg, ind. Gloucester, ind. rep. Law rence, dem. New Bedford, rep. Waltham, rep.

Peking, Dec. 4.—Chinese officials say that the appointment of a new heir apparent to the t/hrone will be delayed until the emperor, Kwnng Su, can discuss the question with leading men. The imperial edict de posing the former heir apparent, Pti Chun, son of Prince Tuan, the au-1 thor of Boxer troubles, is generally considered as the strongest proof yet given of the sincerity of the em-1 press' leaning towards reform. Con sidered with previous edicts, this last one appears to corroborate the belief among Chinese officials that the empress sees the error of her anti-foreign policy of recent years. Fatal ISxploalon. Bedford, Ind., Dec. 4.—In a boiler explosion at a sawmill near Yellow stone Tuesday Marion Lutz, Perry Mitchell and Ellis Henderson were in stantly killed.

Washington, Dec. 3.—I'orto Rico and the l'hilippines became domestic terri tories immedialely upon the ratifica tion of the treaty of peace. The con stitution followed the (lag lo till of the islands, and they immediately became territories of the United States. Duties levied in this country against lie product of I hose islands under the Dingley law were illegal and must be returned, but merely because of the failure of congress to act. The islands never have been foreign since the treaty of peace. The power of congress to pass laws for the regulation of tin territories is unrestricted. It conies from the con stitution itself. The 1'oraker act, providing civil gov ernment for I'orto ltico, is constitu tional. The duties il levied in the United Slates and in I'orto ltico alike were legally collected because they were imposed by an act passed in pur suance of the constitutional right of congress to govern he territories as it Sees fit. All dul iescollect ed on goods between the United States ,-iikI 1 lit Philippines under Ihe Dingley tnrilV are illegal, be cause the Dingley tarill' specifically lixes duties 011 goods coming from for eign countries, whereas the Philip pines are domestic.

OCCINIOIIK of Siiitreme Citlirt in III Milar (.'iiKt-K (liilli' SnliNfuctory crltluciil. nshinyton, Die. 4.—The cabinet meeting Tuesday was principally con sumed in a iliseiission of the insular decisions liamiii! down Monday by the supreme court. On the whole it is be!:eved the views of the majority of the court were ijuitc satisfactory to ihe administration. It was pointed out that the ultimate results of the decisions arc in a measure speculative at present with the exception that the customs duties collected in this country on goods shipped from the Philippines since the rat ifieation of the Paris treaty will have to be refunded. It is not thought, however, that the aggregate will lie large and Secretary Gage expects that it will be within $1,0(10,0(1(1. lie called attention to the fact that the great bulk of the im ports from the Philippines were atT mittcd free of duty under our gen eral tariff laws, notably hemp, which is one of the leading staples of the islands. The present tarilT laws now in op eration in the Philippines, Mr. Gage thinks, will need 1 1 tie or no revision. It was p-epared after the most thor ough and intelligent investigation and is said to be highly satisfactory lo Ihe business interests of Ihe is lands. The preparation of a tarilTon Philippine import a I ions into the Unit ed Stales, howr ver, is expected to con sume considerable of the time of con gress, but there is expectation that, pending a tinal^ settlenient of the ques tion, congress by joirl resolution may continue Ihe duties imposed by the Dingley tariff and thus, if it is so dis posed, cut off a flood of imports which might follow the announcement that nil duties were removed. Manila. Dee. 4.—The local newspa pers published extras on the news of the United Slates supreme court's de cision 1 lint tlie Philippines were American territory and thai the im position of duty on articles imported into the United Slates from the Phil ippines is improper. The decision caused jubilation aniomr the mer chants and the general public. l'»prc seiilntives of the prii.cipal business houses say it will revolutionize the entire trade of tin- orient. Civil au thorities believe the law applies only to goods going to the United States, and are anxiously awaiting nn official communication, since, if the decision holds here, ew means for obtaining funds to run the government will lie necessary. (Ien. Luke Wright, the vice governor, thinks a general revi sion of taxation is imperative.
