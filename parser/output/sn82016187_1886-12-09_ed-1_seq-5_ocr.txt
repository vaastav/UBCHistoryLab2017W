Groups of members crowded the cloak rooms and block aded the aisles, chatting, laughing, exchaug- congratulations ou success in the recout oleo lions, or ooudoloiiaoB upon defeat. At pre oisoly 18 o'olook Speakor Carlisle rapped tlio House to order and the chalain delivored the iprayur, iu which he feelhiKly roferrod to the doafih of Representatives lieach and ArnoL of Now York aud invoked the Divine supervision over tfie proooedings of Congress.

Tho Annual Hoport of Sociotary of the Treas ury Manning to Congress is mainly dovoted to the oousidoration of tho silver question aud icurroncy aud taxation reform. In regard to THE 

81LVIJB QUESTION lio says: "The act of 1673, which domouotized the standard silvor dollar, and tho act of 1678, ivhioh romonotized ' it, arc so noarly identical that a common authorship might bo suspected. The aotoflri7S has beeudonouncod aud praised for demonetising silvor, which it did not do. Tlio aol of 1878 lias boon praised aud donouncod for Tomouetixing silver, which it did uot do. Both took a sure way to kcop our fractional silvor at home. Exportations would only be possible at a loss on tho silver coined uudor oithor aots. In both acts monotization is de nied oxcopt to Treasury purchases." The Secre tary reviews at longth tho action of foreign Governments on the silvor question, aud shows lliow thoy woro forced iulothoir present atti tude towards silvor. "Tho Secretary is of tho opinion that the time for another couforeuco lni6 not arrived, and the moment for diplomatic interference is not felicitous. Treasury silver purohasc is oharactorizod as ' an expense aud a (taxation demonstrated by exporieuco to be of 110 avail.' To stop tho purchnso of silver is our only ohoioc, our duty, and our intorest. It Will stop a wasteful and injurious expense, aud tho taxation which dofrays it. It will coni monoc aud promote reform iu the sum aud tho iinothoas of Podoral taxation. It will recover to itholUnitod States an equality of position (non coinage) with foreign powers, which will give us duo iufliionoc iu negotiation. To increase our stock is to increase tho dillicultiee of the Treasury, illegitimate and abnormal difficul ties. To stoji purchasing will enable tho Treasury to maintain with corlaiuty aud greater tease the present -Slock of silvor com at par with gold lu all our iifccnl and local uses. "Another jvnr's delay in stopping tho silvor ,purohase is tho loss of remunerative prices iupou another whoat orop of the United States. It is for Congress to consider whether aipolicy which does uot prevent the Joss of 25 ipor cont, ofl of our silvor output to a fow (thousand mine-owners, but prolongs the loss to many million farmors of 25 per cent, of the iprlcc of tiieir annual wheat crop, should not now bo abandouod and tho only policy adopted whioh promises to restore tho former prosperity of ihoth." THE PINANCltS. The ordinary receipts of the Government for itbo fiscal year onded Juno SO, 16S0, were $330, 43tt.727.08. Of this amount $192,905,023.41 was Tooeived from oustoms und $HC,y05,'J30.48 from iutrnal revenue.

(0H,4Gt1W W 17,bM,M7 08 Kir. U),M,e;7 oo ItKDUCINO THE BBVCSUK. Iu regard to the reduction of tho rovcuuo tho Soorotary says that reasons for dolay in reduc ing our surplus taxation, can no longer be found in a rapid payinont of the dobt. Sotting asido tho vanishing throe per cents aud Uiounfunded debt of $340,000,000,1110 residue of the public dobt has been in such wise funded by our pre decessors that $250,000,000 cannot bo paid ex cept by purchase at a high premium to tho bondholder, bofore Sopt. 1,1691, ami that4,737, 770,400 cannot bo paid except by purchase at a high premium to the bondholder, before July 1, 1907. To continue the present surplus taxation, aud to omploy its proceods in giving to the bondholder premiums by anticipatory purchase of thoe bonds bofore they are due and payablo at par, is a fiscal polioj' unnecessary, extrava gant aud morciless to the industrious toilers of our laud. Compliance with tho provisions of the sink ing fund and tho public debt will effect tho payment of tho whole public debt, greoubacks mid bonds, by tho yoar 1903 without a con tinuance of our present surplus taxation. Ho recommonds tho repeal of tho clauso in the act ofPeb. 23, 1876, making compulsory Treasury purchase- of silvor, in order to reduce surplus and unnecessary taxation $21,000,000 a year. 2. Further reduction of suiplus taxation closo down to the necessities of the Government eco nomically administered. 3. Repeal of the act of May 31, 1878, making compulsory post-redemption issues aud reissues of United Stato3 logal tender notes. 4. Gradual purchase and payment of $316,01,010 outstanding promissory notes of the Unitod States with the prosontand and accruing Treasury surplus, issuing silvor certificates in their room, and gold certicatcs if need be, without contraction of the prcseut cir culating volume of the currency. Tho Secre tary says: " What surplus wo expend in paying off tho groonhack debt will diminish by so much tho immediate reduction of our tariff taxation; for Avhilo the funded debtstauds certainly it is not wise to discard tho taxes on whisky, tobacco and boor, lndcod, it is my own belief that whouever wo begin taking off tho shackles of war-tariff taxes on raw materials, Ave shall see our income from imported manu factures dwindle po fast as not only to compel the ret out ion of those most fit items of revenue whisky, tobacco and boor but, perhaps, to drive us hack to getting 10 millions of revenue from two cents a pound lax ou coffee and half as much from tea." rBOTUcTioN vs. ranc tcade. On the question of protection and frcotrado the Sociotary says: '"Free trade' accurately describes the internal commerce of our States. It does not apply to our trado with foreign na tions. No man now living will ever see 'freo trade' adopted by those United Statos in their commerce with foreign nations; for taxos on imports, from tho foundation of this Govern ment, have ovor been one chief source of Fed oral revenue, and such thoy will continue to be. Wore trade as free with and within all tho ununited States of Europe as it is among tho Unitod Sttites of America, the great surplus pro ducts of our iudustry, including the manufact ured, would have tho pick of foreign markets, for the reason that our labor, being tho most highly paid and insuring lowest percentage of labor cost, would every where surpass rivalry. "I respectfully recommend to Congress that they confer upon -wage-earners of the Unitod States the boon of untaxed clothing, aud iu or der thereto, the immcdiato pas-agc of an act placing raw wool upon tho freo list. A repeal of the duty on raw wool should be followed by a compensating adjustment of the duties ou manufactured woolens. But the common daily clothing of tho American peoplo nocd not be taxed; to freo thoir clothing of taxis will finally reduce, by half, their exponso for ono of the threo great necessities of life. There are several hundred articles among tho 4,182 arti cles that wo tax, whioh ought at once to bo ewopt off the tax list into tho free list." 

TIIE TEEASUUEE'S EEl'OET. Tho annual report of Treasurer Jordan calls attention to the necessity of changes iu our financial system. lie says tho three per cents will bo retired during the fiscal yoar, and only thofour and four-and-a-half per couts be left available for siuking-fund purposes, these bonds only earning two per cent, on their mar kot value. Consequently it will bo found im practicable to make purchases at such timos as to relievo tho money market in timos of dis tress. Department of the Interior. THE IKDIATJS. Tho Secretary of tho Intorior in his annual report says that there has beon a steady, though uot rapid, improvement in tho moral, matorial, and intellectual condition of tho mass of tho Indian populatiou during tho past 12 months. Tho avorage attendance of children iu tho schools is about 1,000 greater than heretofore, and many more of tho parents nro anxious for thooducation of their children. Ho says that the Indians must be thoroughly civilized, the only alternative being absolute extinction. He urgently recommends individual property holding aud education of Indian youth, with practical instruction iu tho domestic and me chanical arts as the moans by which this end cau bo roachod. The Secretary renews his rocommondation of last year for tho appoint ment of a commission to inspect and report upon the condition of the Indians. Tho work of locating the Indians on lands in sevoralty has, howevor, boon pushed forward, aud during tho year about 800 ludians have recoived title There are now 214 schools of different kinds maintained, at a cost of $037,631, and tho aver ago attendance is 9,523. It is recommended that Congress enact auch legislation as will au thorize the Indians to take cattle from neigh boring cattlemen to pasture ou tho surplus lands of their reservations, theludiaus to herd and caro for the cattle aud to receive a fair compensation. THE PUBLIC LANDS. The Secretary renews his recommendation of last year that tho minimum price for sales of laud at private cash entry bo increased, aud also recommonds tho onactmout of a law bar ring tho presentation of claims founded on al- jogoa juexican iana grants, alter such lime as Congress may determine, to tho ond that the incentive for tho presentation of false claims may no longer oxist, aud that those which are bona fide may tko more readily aud speedily bo adjudicated. Unless Congress soos fit to modify tho desert land laws so as to render them loss liable to abuse tho Secretary would reuew his former recommendation that these laws bo repealed, lie also renews his recommendation that tho tim ber culture laws bo repealed. Ho recommends legislation to preserve the public limber and tho moaiucaiion oi tueaclsot Junes, lfa8. Tho repeal of tho relinquishment act of Juno 22, 1874, and tho law authorizing tho system of deposits for surveys is recommonded. Ho also urges a continuance of the measures inaug urated last year to prevent tho unlawful fouciug of the public domain by cat tlo-mcu and others. "While many trespassers on notification have removed their fences, it is undeniably truo that a largor number still maintain thorn, and will refuse to oboy the law oxcopt uuder actual compulsion. OOXCEUKIXa J'EKSIO.VS. On the subject of ponsions Secretary Lamar recommonds iu connection with tho Pension Uu reau, such a change iu the law that in the caso of parent of increasing years, or children of tondor years below tho age of 1G, where their coudition of physical dopondoncc is not due to thoir fault or habits, but is merely a matter of miaionuno or time, that they should bo allowed petition from tho date at which tho dependence iu tho natural and ordinary slate of human affairs would begin. Also that tho law be so amended that tho ponaion shall bo allowed fortho rauk subsequently borne, lonafidc, bo fore discharge, or at date of discharge, where the disability is shown to have originated in tho sorvico and in lino of duty, and subject to tho further condition that in no ovoiithhall tho pension aulcdate tho law allowing such in crease. The wnr Drjiu-tincnL COST OF THE AKMY. Tho annual report of tho Secretary of War states that the appropriations of the War De partment for lb37 are $10,027,559.85, and tho estimates for tho next fiscal year amouut to $4b,20S,835.bl. In tho army estimates that for pay, etc., of the army is increased $305,000. Thocstimato for public works includes for arm amout of fortifications, $4,015,000; improving harbors and rivers, $10,175,870, and $150,000 for a building for the SigualOilice. THE ArACHE WAE. Tho Seorctary states that tho constant pres ence of troops Is necessary to prcservo peace in the Indian Territory and to prevent the seizure of land. Ho refers at length to the Apacho campaign, and states iu relation to tho attack on Capt. Crawford's command on Jan. 11 by Mexicans, that tho Mcxicaus deny all the statements rnado by our oflicers, and say that they were tho attacked and not tho attacking party. Tho Mexican Government demands in demnity for depredations alleged to havo been committed by Crawford's command. Nego tiations are now pending between tho Depart ment of State aud the Mexican Govornmcut in reforence to tho killing of Capt. Crawford, and the return of tho horses and mulc3 loaned to the Mexican troops, orpuyment of thoir value. In rclatiou to tho surrender of Gerouimo to Gen. Miles, the Secretary states that from tho first information the surrender was supposed to bo unconditional, but later Gen. Miles tele graphed that the ludians surrendered with the understanding that they would bo sent out of tho country, and that ho had ordered them to be taken to Fort Marion in direct opposition to the President's orders. These terms and con ditions were such that Goronimo and thoso of his band who had committed murders and acts of violence iu Arizoua and New Mexico could not properly bo handed over to tho civil au thorities for punishment, as was intended by tho President, aud they were sent to Fort Pick ens, Fla. 

VAEIOUS KECOMMEXDATIOXS. Tho Secretary recommonds that tho retired list bo increafod, and that all officers perma nently incapacitated for activo servico bo in cluded upon it. He recommends that tho army be increased by 5,000 men, aud two companies bo added to each of tho iufautry regiments; also that n general law bo enacted, with provisions for tho examination of army oflicers for promotion similar to thoso which govern promotions in tho navy. It is also suggested that a statute be enacted applying tho common-law rulo to do sorters, authorizing their arrest by privato citizeus or police officers. Tho Secretary rec ommonds that legislative authority bo granted for tho enlistment of ono cook for each troop, battery and company, aud each general depot of recruits, aud of a baker for each garrisoned post. EEACOAST DEHISCES. The Secretary says that immcdiato action should be taken to prevent the disastrous aud hu miliating results that might follow a declaration of war with tho most insignificant of foroigu powers possessing guns aud ships of modern construction, and recommends that New York, San Francisco, Boston and Washington bo for tified at once. WASHINGTON GOSSIP, The Week's Doings at tlio Na tional Capital. "the JCEGEO rnonLEir." Ono evening last week Col. George W. Will iamsthe only colored man who reached that rank during the late war delivered in this city an able lecture ou "Tho Negro Problem." Col. Williams was appointed by Prcsidct Arthur Minister lo Hayti. Ho has also won distinction in the literary field, his "History of the Negro Uaco of America" having attracted no littlo attention, as did also his " History of theNegro Troops of tho llebollion." Among his other works is a review of the military services of the negro in ancient and modern timc3. In his lecture Col. Williams handled tho diffi cult subject in a skillful manner. In the course of his remarks ho said : Notwithstanding the many signs of tlio breaking down of tbonlmost impregnable lines of racctmti pHlby, many of our countrymen nrc Blill stubbornly intrenched behind absolute prejudiced, bales and resentments. These views must be routed; and until they arc dislodged the nogro problem cannot be solved. It was an economicqneation that intro duced the African upon thin continent, aud it is an economic question that we must address ourselves to the negro problem to-day. Col. Williams passed quickly over tho various attempts and consequent failures to colvo tho negro problem that followed tho war, nnd said: Tlio necro then became esteemed, simply on ao count of Ids numerical value. Therefore in any judicial or historical consideration of the progress of the ucjro during the Inst dcoadea his political preferment must be regarded as the most unsatis factory evidence of his ascension in tho calo of in telligence. llut ono more bono remains for thoso who still adhere to the idea that tho ucuro problem can bo fcolved by political methods. The present Demo cratic Administration may bo expected to do some thing lo settle this question. And I adsiunu the rc-t-poiibibility of advising and urging the negro to go out of the Itopnblicau party into auy other party that he may And that will secure to him the full aud free exercise of bis rights as a laborer. For a party llint does not or cannot secure to its members their primal rights, " life, liberty aud the pursuit of hap piness," does not deserve support or success. 

TRADE DOLLAES. Holders of trade dollars have tho assurance of several prominent Congressmen that an effort will bo made this Winter to pass a bill provid ing for the redemption of this much-abused coin. Similar efforts havo been made iu pre vious Congresses, but thoy havo failed because it was alleged that tho bulkof this coin is held by speculators. It is said that four or five years ago a concerted movement among New York specu lators depreciated the valuo of tho trade dollar, and forced it down to a current value of from 78 to 65 cents. This was owing to two causes the discovery that tho Government must re deem this class of coin becauso it was obsoleto and worth less than its face value, and also be causo certain capitalists determined to buy it up for speculative purposes. Thoy were pur chased at an avcrago of 65 cents and withdrawn from circulation. If they should bo redeemed now the speculators would only make about 15 per cent, on their investment, which has stood for four years. Under tho circumstances tho objection to tho passage of such a bill on tho ground that it is in tho interest of speculators alone no longer holds good, aud there seems to bo no reason why Congress should further with hold legislation ou tho subject. JCATE FIELD WILL LECTURE. Kit Carson Post, No. 2, G.A.R., has unani mously requested Miss Kate Field to lecture on Mormonism and Mis3 Field has consented to speak in tho Congregational Church on tho cvoning of the 15th inst.

POINT OK VIEW. Tho peoplo in tho northwest suburbs of Washington are not altogether unanimous about tho advantages to bo gained by haviug the President establish his country residence iu that quarter. John Schumann, n saloon keopor on the Tcnlcytown road, has been re fused a licenso ou tho ground that his place was too near tho President's house. John grumbles fiercely at this discrimination against him, and has appealed to tho Commissioners. Ifc asserts that tho peoplo of his neighborhood caro a groat deal more about having their beer than they do about having tho President live among thorn, and they would rather buy tho Presidentoutthan forego the prlvilego of buy ing their drinks where thoy want to. John is probably correct as to the class of citizens who frequent his saloon, but when it comes to buy ing out tho President they probably could not all together buy tho front porch of lied Top if tho whole place was offered for 1,000.

Hcsayshoisnot near so roly-poly as ho was when ho went to Wisconsin in August. There used to be a time when ho could not sco his shoes, nnd ' ho had to tio them feeling ; but now ho can sea oven his knees. ThcSenator prides himself on his strength of arm, and while home this Fall ho put ou a blue blouse and worked in ono o his sawmills. He thinks ho cau haudle a saw log with a3 much graco aud dispatch as ever ho could. He tells a pretty good story on himself. Ono day while ho was nt work in tho mill a wealthy aud enterprising young business man came up to Oshkosh to seo him. At the office ho was told that Mr. Sawyer wa3 in tho mill. Tho young Chicagoau, dressed iu tho hight of style, tiptoed his way into tho mill and finally found a jolly littlo old fat man in a bluo bluuso down in a saw pit filing a big circular saw. His bald head was hare, his hands were grimy with oil and saw filings, and his Santa Claus face wa3 wet with perspiration. Going up to him, ho asked : " Can you toll mo where I'll find Mr. Saw yer?" " Kight here," said tho jolly fat man. " I'm Sawyer." "Oh ah oxcuso mo," faltered the Chicagoan, "I didn't know you were such a or rather ahem I didn't supposo you looked that is, I hardly expected to find you so bald, Mr. Saw yer," and tho young fellow, turning white and red with ovory word ho uttered, began to per spire and wish ho had studied np beforehaud tho art of talking to a plain Yankee quarto millionaire who could wear a bluo hlouso aud file saws baldhcadcd. THE WirE OK JUDOE DAVIS PARALYZED. Mrs. John Davis, second daughter of tho lato Secretary of Stato Frolinghuyscn, aud wife of Judgo Davis, of the Court of Claims, has become a hopeless invalid. Sho has never recovered from the injuries received by being thrown from a drag at Lenox, Mass., last Summer. It was thought, after hor return to Washington, that her recovery would bo rapid and certain. "The other day Mrs. Davis felt so well that she thought she would try to walk downstairs with assistance. This was her first attempt to walk sinco tho injury. She had taken but a few stcp3 when she fell from a stroke of paralysis. Tho attack was severe, but does not cxtond abovo tho lcg3. Tho physician in attendance does uot think Mrs. Davis will ever be ablo to walk again, but at tho samo time her general health will probably bo good, so that she may li vo for years, but will always havo to remain in a re clining position. This sad fate of n lady who was so prominent in society under tho hist ad ministration has created great sympathy throughout Washington. Within less than two years she was ono of tho most conspicuous and sought after in social circles. Her beauty, dash, and style, backed by tho official power and so cial position of her father, gavo her great power. Her influence extended even to political cir cles. AT CALUMET PLACE. The delightful homo that General and Mrs. Logan havo created out of an old mansion on ono of tho hills on tho northern boundary of Washington has had its brightness greatly in creased by tho arrival there of their daughter, Mra.

Mrs. Tucker is a charming, cultivated woman, with bright, cheery manners, that make her a general favor ite with all whom she meets. Sho has always been very popular in Washington society, and it now welcomos hor back with onthusiasm. Sho will bo of tho greatest assistance to her mother in tho performance of the arduous social duties which the hitter's position imposo upon her.
