I Washington. I-ec. 1. War time re strictions on the nation s use of coal, more strong even than those ap plied during the war were ordered in to effect today to stave of a fuel famine. Moved by reports of diminishing coal stocksand growing danger of dis tress in numerous sections, the gov emmcnX' sought no compromise with striking mine workers whose walkout forced the emergency, but asked for national determination to endure pri vation and discomfort until coal min ing was resumed on its terms. Fuel Administrator Garfield, acting in conjunction with the railroad ad ministration, gave notice that here 'irr only the essentia' consumers i---tuaVd in the first Hve classes of titude was made by the attorney gen eral in a telegram to the chamber of commerce at Moberly; Mo., from which had come a request that an other conference of operators and miners be called. Mr. Palmer opposed further confer ences, saying wage increases proposed by Dr. Garfield equalized the average miner's wages with the present high cost of living without increasing the price of coal. This, he said, was fair to the miners and protected the pub lic. "The cost of living is now at the high point," Mr. Palmer said. "To grant the demands of the miners would make the cost of living still higher. The new wage conference would run three winters, and there Cabled Paragraphs Lady Astor Votes in Commons.

The order, which made national thoat restrictions already nut into Io cs!

Railroad adminis tration officials conceded that it meant widespread cessation of industrial op raUona.0 nly Justified by the grav ity of the situation. "3t is necessary that coal shall be Used only for essential purposes." Dr. Garfield said in giving public notifi cation of the step. "Public utilities consuming coal should discontinue to furnish power, heat and light to non essential industries and should con some only sufficient coal to produce enough light, power and heat to meet the actual urgent needs of the peo ple. Signs and displays of various kinds necessitating the use of coal should he curtailed and no coal should b distributed for such purposes. Officials said that the terms of the order a given were framed to allow the greatest possible variation in lo cal arrangements, so that emergencies could be met by action best suited to that result. Industrial establish ments operating their power plants will be forced to shut down when the present supplies are exhausted, while tlx operations of those whose power is lupplied from public utility plants will bo surtalled and continued in the discretion of local agencies and of ficials. Dr. Garfield noted further that the "Government would be glad to leave supervision and control of dis tribution by retail dealers entirely to any state, county or municipality which may make provision therefore." These arrangements. It was sug gested, would all be maintained while they proved adequate, but the federal ovenunent would hold a final power to intervene by cutting off coal sup plies where rationing measures are pot being fairly or fully taken. "it is necessary that coal shall be used only for essential purposes." said a statement by Dr. Garfield.

"The state and other local authori ties can materially aid in Inspecting and supervising such distribution by retail dealers and the United States government will be rfiad to leave the supervision and control of such dis tribution by retail dealers entirely to any state, county or municipality which may make provision therefore. The distribution to the retail dealers mart necessarily he administered by the railroad administration in pursu ance of the orders already made bv the United States fuel administration in earning out the priorities which have been prescribed under the Lever act." Officials were hopeful that the ad vance of 14 per cent. In mine work ers' wages would result In getting some o' th men back to work, es pecially in view of the fact that coal operators generally were backing up the offer. But at the same time it was said that a period of several days would be required before the effect of this could be determined. Member o' a mine operators' committee were r Washington watching the situation, and preparing for a general sqssion Wednesday, when details of applica tion of the 14 per cent, increase will bis arranged, but had no reports of work resumption. living for substantially three years. Such a situation cannot be tolerated. "In addition to this. Dr. Garfield suggested a consultative body to in vestigate more completely the whole situation, to 'be composed of repre sentatives in equal number of " the miners and operators, and to be pre sided over by the secretary of the in terior. Such a body would investi gate, among other things, the profits of the operators. If these should be found to be unreasonably high, the public should receive the benefit in a decreased price of coal, after the min ers have had their wages finally ad justed on a fair basis. I understand this plan is acceptable to the opera tors. If the miners return to work and agree, to this plan, a way would be immediately opened for permanent settlement. "In the meantime, however, the op erators have posted the advance in wages proposed by Dr. Garfield, so that working miners will immediately receive the benefit of this increase. The production of coal now closely approximates SO per cent, of normal and I have conlidence that a sufficient number of miners will comply with the wishes of their government and re spond to the needs of the people to increase this production in the near future to a point which will supply the demand If economy and conservation in industry are employed. "Any other plan to reopen negotia tions for a new wage scale between the miners and operators would be fu tile and would delay rather than ad vance production. As long as the lenders of the miners organizations believe that their unlawful strike will force the public into a condition of suffering and loss which will compel further increases of wages, continued conferences on the subject will only result in influficing miners not to re turn to work. "The situation calls for the stead fast support by the public of the gov ernment's position as announced by Dr. Garfield. The public should re fuse to be stampeded by threats of lack of fuel into concessions which will insure unreasonably high prices in all commodities for at least three years to come." "Washington, Dec. 1. Under the permanent chairmanship of Secretary of Labor Wilson, another attempt to harmonize relations between, capital and labor was begun here today with the opening of the second industrial conference called by President Wilson. Herbert Hoover was elected perma nent vice chairman and Stanley King of Boston, "temporary secretary, until an executive secretary, not a delegate, could be obtained. Unlike its predecessor, the second conference began behind closed doors after newspapermen present had been asked to leave. Speaking for the con ference .when the Erst meeting ad journed after more than three hours of discussion, Mr. King said that ex ecutive sessions would be continued "for the present" and that the Ques tion of opening the doors had not yet come before the delegates, several of whom are understood to favor the ut most publicity on deliberations which may affect vitally the entire country. Secretary Wilson explained before he called the delegates to order that he believed executive sessions advis able to permit frank discussion, while allowing the delegates to keep their minds open until a decision was reach ed, lie declared their ideas should not bo "chained" to first expressions of opinion before heaving what other delegates had to say. In opening the conference, Mr. Wil son recited the general situation which required new deliberations by delc gates, all of whomjiave been promi nent in public life'and few of whom have been identified with -either side in industrial controversies of the past. All of the seventeen members except George T. Slade. of St. Paul, who is in Europe, were present. The general field of activities to be covered and the best methods of dealing with ach subject were discussed without a de cision being reached. The cost of living, collective bargaining and other problems of the day entered into the talk. None of the delegates would venture an opinion as to when the conference would finish its task, though several commented that President Wilson had assigned them a very broad field.

The govern ment's note to Mexico made public here today at the hour of its delivery in Mexico City, renews the request for the immediate release of William O. Jenkins, the American Consular Agent imprisoned at Pueblo and hluntty charges Carranza with at tempting to becloud the issue. In the sharpest language yet ad dressed to the Carranza government and probably more pointed than one government usually addresses to another in a formal diplomatic com munication, the United States says it regards Mexico's plea of judicial rea sons for not releasing Jenkins as "mere excuses", and gives notice that it will not be drawn away from the main facts and into a discussion of "irrelevant and unimportant matters." The attitude of the Carrana gov ernment in the matter, the note says, has been to "assume a wilful indif ference to the feelings of the Ameri can pople" and the conclusion drawn by the government is that Mexico has sought to divert the attention of the American people and the Mexican people as well from the fact that Puebla, second largest city in Mexico, is over-run by bandits while the civil j authorities are negligent.

Luraan Q. Beckett, 22 years old, who formerly lived ia Kensington, this state, has made a written confession that he murdered Charles A. Taft, a Hartford taxicab driver, in New Britain oh March 1, 1917. Captain Robert T. Hurley of the Connecticut state police anno'unced tonight that he had se cuied the confession from Beckett, who is in the state prison- at ' Wind sor, Vt., serving a sentence of two and one-half to seven years for as sault and robbery. When Taft was found dead in his taxicao with a bullet hole in the head, the police worked on the case for several months without getting any clues of importance. Beckett's con fession, according to Captain Hurley, says he shot Taft and that robbery was the only motive. Captain Hurley also said that the confession tells of Beckett s move ments after the murder. He stayed in New Britain for several weeks and then left as a member of Company I, 102nd Infantry. He deserted with in a short time, the confession says, and eventually was arrested in Nor wich, Conn. The confession then passes over the period to the summer of 1918 and tells of Beckett's arrest in Vermont and ' tir- subsequent sentencing of Beckett in October, 1918. Captain Hurley did not tell where the information came from which led to Beckett. He said, however, that ife first visited Beckett in the Vermont prison ten. months ago. The visit of Captain Hurley a few days ago brought forth the written' confession. The grand jury wiil .be. in the su perior court here on "Wednesday and State's Attorney Hugh M.

"The danger to the United States if this condition of continual unrest and feeling of hostility toward us in Mexico," Mr. Porter said, "lies in the fact that it provides a field for Anti American propaganda and even for a base for attack upon the United States by any foreign country that effected a combination with Mexico. By this the spirit, if not the letter, of the Monroe Doctrine would be violated. "Property rights have been violated and the Mexican courts have declared constitutional the confiscatory provi sions of the Mexican fundamental law which we have taken a strong stand against. If we permit the property ngnts ot our nationals in Mexico to be thus violated, where can we stop'.' Suppose Brail and Argen tina and Germany and other nations adopt such a confiscatory law: Our interest abroad woald be wiped out. "For three years or more I have been firmly convinced that cither amicable or forceful intervention in Mexico by the United States is inev itable.
