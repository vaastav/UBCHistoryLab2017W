The profligate squandering of the pub lic lands to railroad companies, is noticed and he advises that in future, the title in not pass until the companies shall fcave made portions of the roads intended to be aided. It seems that our government had made tome agreement with France that she should withdraw her troops from Mexico in three divisions part in November, 1866, and apart in 1867. This was none if our business, bat it will suit the notions of many.. Fraeee has not withdrawn any troops in November but purposes to withdraw all at once next year, which i? wise, for she ought not to withdraw a part and leave a part to be captured. There upon Mr. Seward sent 19,000 dollars worth of cable despatch protesting against the delay and the President sends our Lient.-General to Mexico to look about which may cost something more than cable despatches, and male the green backs and bonds as plenty as they will be uncertain in value. To My Congressman, "So-called;" Dear Ma. Jackass: So you have repealed the law, " so-called " which was passed to let Mr. Lincoln know that the President had power to pardon people You have done a good deal of foolery and still got along, but My Dear Jackass, ean assure you that there are some bounds to people's contempt. Are you such ninny as to think that you can take away the President's power? Be careful of your ears and preserve them long and soft. ' Yours, truly, TOM.

MESSAGE. Full Abstract of its Contents—The President's Views on Restoration Unchanged—Our Relations with England. Telegraphic Correspondence Cincinnati Commercial. WASHINGTON Dec. 2. a a a at a The President's Message will be de livered to-morrow to both Houses -of Congress. atl P. M., by Colonel Robert Johnson, The Private Secrotary. Within an hour from that time it will be issued fh full from the offices of the leading journals of this country. There will bo, therefore, no violation ot tr.ith. nor promise in anticipating a few hours its salient and important points ra toe loi- lowing correct synopsis : The Messacre opens, as usual, "Witn thauks to Providence for the peace and prosperity in the abatement of the pesti lence and the restoration of civil author ity throughout the United States. A review is then had ot the tacts set forth in the last message, relative to the measures which the Executive had taken for the gradual restoration of the South ern States to the' Union, such as appoint ing Provisional Governors. &c. Only one thing then remained, the message says, to be done, and that was the admis sion of the loyal representatives to Con gress. This question was devolved solely on Congress. In the meantime, the President says, no other plan having been proposed, be continued his efforts to perfect a restoration throngh the judi cial, revenue, and postal systems of the country. '. The South had also ratified the amend ment abolishing slavery, conformed their sorial laws to the fact, repudiated the rebel debts, and proceeded in good faith to legislate for the amelioration of the colored races. .. The President then speaks as follows: " Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these States to representa tion, and it was near the close of the eigth month of the session that an ex ception was made in favor of Tennessee. I deem it a subject of profound regret that Congress has thus far failed to admit to stats the loyal Senators and Kepresen tntives from the other States, wherein the inhabitants, with those of Tennessee, had engaged in rebellion ; ten States, more than one-fourth of the whole nnm ber. remain without representation. The seats of fifty members of the House and twenty of the Senate are yet vacant, not by their own consent, not by a failure of election, but by the refusal of Con- Tess to accent ineir credentials. " Their admission.it is believed, would have accomplished much toward the re newal and strengthening of our relations as one people, nad removed seriou3 cause for discontent on the part ot the people of those States. It would have accorded with great principle enunciated in the Declaration of American Independence, that no people ought to bear the burden of taxation and yet be denied represen tation. It would have been in conson ance with the express provisions of the Constitution, that each State shall have at least one Representative, and that no State, without its consent, shall be de prived of equal suffrage in the Senate. "These provisions were intended to secure to every State the right of repre sentation in Congress, and so important was it deetued by the framersof the Con stitution that the equality of Srates shall be preserved in the Senate, that nnf even by an amendment of the Constitution can any State, wi'hout its consent, be de nied a voice in that branch of the Na tioiinl Legislature. ''it has been assumed that these States by rebellion became Territories, but all departments of the Government with ireat distinctness, refused to sanction an assumption so incompatible with the nature of our Republican system, and the professed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legislation of Congress, the undeniable fact 'mnkes itself apparent that these ten political communities are nothing less than States." The President then quotes the Crit tenden resolutions or 1861, on the object of the war, and reviews the legislation of Congress wherein the states are recog nized, and also in Lincoln's proclama tion. He then proceeds again, as follows "In the admission ot Senators and Representatives from all the States there can bo no grounds of apprehension thnf persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation, for this could not happen when the Constitution and laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Congress. Each House is the judge of its own members. A Senator or member may be admitted or rejected, or his credentials referred to a proper committee. If admitted to a seat, it must be one evidence satisfactory thathe possesses the requisite loyal and consti tutional qualifications. If refused ad mission, and sent to his constituents for want of due allegianoe, they are admon ished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be allowed in the councils of the nation, and the power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in the interest of loy alty to the Government and fidelity to the Union', "Upon this question, so vitally affect ing the restoration of the Union,' and the permanency of our form of govern ment, my convictions, heretofore ex pressed, have undergone no change, but, on the contrary, their correctness have been confirmed by reflection and time. , " If the admission of loyal members to seats in Congress was wise and expe dient a year ago, it is no less wise and ex pedient now. If this anomalous condi tion is right now if in tho exact condi' tion of these States at the present time, it is lawful to exclude them from repre sentation, I do not seo that the question will be changed by the effect of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of representation will be no stronger and the right of ex clusion will be no weaker. " The Constitution makes it the duty of the President to recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as-he skill deem expedient. I know no measure more imperatively demand ing the consideration of national interest, sound policy and equal justice than the admission of loyal members from the unrepresented States. It would consum mate the restoration, renew visor and stability, and induce emigration, and opeu new fields ef enterprise." - The President concludes on restoration by repeatiug the warniugs of others against a consolidated despotism, and does not mako the slightest reference the pending constitutional amendmeut, nor to the much-talked of amnesty and suffrage question. : of to gl0tfeifl NOW IS THE
