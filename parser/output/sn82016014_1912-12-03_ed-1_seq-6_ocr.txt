THE TOPFKA. D ATT.Y STATE JTOtrpT4E DECEMBER, 3, 1912 PRESIDENT TAFT'S FINAL MESSAGE DEALS WITH OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS "The position of the United States in the moral, intellectual, and material relations of the family of nations should be a matter of vital interest to every patriotic citizen." (5 Important Work Re cently Done by the Diplomatic Corps. 

MERIT SYSTEM IS EFFECTIVE. To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: The foreign relations of the . United States actually and potentially affect the state of the Union to a degree not widely realized and hardly surpassed by any other factor In the welfare of the whole nation. The position of the United States in the moral, intellec tual and material relations of the fam ily of nations should be a matter of Tltal Interest to every patriotic ; citi en. The national prosperity and power Impose upon us duties which we cannot shirk if we are to be true to our ideals. The tremendous growth of the ex port trade of the United States has already made that trade a very real factor in the industrial and commer cial prosperity of the country. With the development of our Industries the foreign commerce of the United States must rapidly become a still more essential factor in its economic welfare. The relations of the United. States with all foreign powers remain upon a sound basis of peace, harmony and friendship. A greater insistence upon justice to American citizens or Inter ests wherever it may have been denied and a stronger emphasis of the need of mutuality In commercial and other re lations have only served to strengthen our friendship with foreign countries by placing those friendships upon a firm foundation of realities as well as aspirations. Reorganization of State Department. At the beginning of the present ad ministration the United States, having fully entered upon its position as a world power, with the responsibilities thrust upon It by the results of the Spanish-American war and already en gaged in Taylng the groundwork of a vast foreign trade upon which it should one day become more and more dependent, found itself without , the machinery for giving thorough atten tion to and taking effective action upon a mass of Intricate business vi tal to American interests in every coun try in the world. The department of state was an archaic and inadequate machine, lack ing most of the attributes of the for eign office of any great modern power. With an appropriation . made upon my recommendation by the congress on Aug. 6, 1909. the department of state was completely reorganized. There were created divisions of Latin-American affairs and of far eastern, near eastern and western European affairs. The law offices of the department were greatly strengthened. There were added foreign trade advisers to' co-operate with the diplomatic and consular bureaus and the politico-geographical divisions In the innumerable matters where commercial diplomacy or con sular work calls for such special knowledge. The same officers, together with the rest of the new organization, are able at all times to give to Ameri can citizens accurate information as to conditions In foreign countries with which they have business and likewise to co-operate more effectively with the congress and also with the other ex ecutive departments. Merit System In Consular and Diplo matic Corpa. Expert knowledge and professional training must evidently be the essence of this reorganization. W.ithout a train ed foreign service there would not be men available for the work in the reor ganised department of state. President Cleveland had taken the first step to ward introducing the merit system in the foreign service. That had been fol lowed by the application of the merit principle, with excellent results to the satire consular branch. Almost noth ing, however, bad been done in this di rection with regard to the diplomatic service. In this age of commercial di plomacy It was evidently of the first importance to train an adequate per sonnel in that branch of the service. Therefore, on Nov. 26, 1909. by an executive order I placed the diplomatic service up to the grade of secretary of embassy, inclusive, upon exactly the same strict nonpartisan basis of the Merit system, rigid examination for ap pointment and promotion only for effi ciency, as had been maintained with out exception in the consular service. Merit and Nonpartisan Character of Appointments. How faithful to the merit system and how nonpartisan has been the con duct of the diplomatic and consular services in the last four years may be Judged from the following: Three am bassadors now serving held their pres ent rank at the beginning of my ad ministration. Of the ten ambassadors whom I have appointed five were by promotion from ' the rank of minister. Nine ministers now serving held their present rank at the beginning of the administration. Of the thirty ministers whom I have appointed, eleven were promoted from the lower grades of the ' toreien service or from the department 9 by Moffet Studio. of state. Of the nineteen missions In Latin-America, where our relations are close and our interest is great, fifteen chiefs of mission are service men, three having entered the service during this administration. The thirty-seven secretaries of em bassy or legation who have received their initial appointments after passing successfully the required examination were chosen for ascertained fitness, without regard to political affiliations. A dearth of candidates from southern and western states has alone made it impossible thus far completely to equal ize all the states' representations in the. foreign service. In the effort to equalize the representation of the sva: rious states in the consular service I have made sixteen of the twenty-nine new appointments as consul which have occurred during' my administra tion from the southern states. This is 55 per cent. Every other consular ap pointment made. Including the promo tion of eleven young men from the con sular assistant and student interpreter corps, has been by promotion or trans fer, based solely upon efficiency shown in the service. Larger Prevision For Embassies and Legations Recommended. In connection with legislation for the amelioration of the foreign service, I wish to invite attention to the advisa bility of placing the salary appropria tions upon a better basis. I believe that the best results would be obtained by a moderate scale of salaries, with adequate funds for the expenses of proper representation, based in each case upon the scale and cost of living at each post, controlled by a system of accounting and under the general di rection of the department of state. In line with the object which I have sought of placing our foreign service ob a basis of permanency, I have at various times advocated provision by congress for the acquisition of govern ment owned buildings for the residence and offices of our diplomatic officers, so as to place them more nearly on an equality with similar officers' of other nations and to do away with the dis crimlaation which otherwise must nec essarily be made in some cases in favor of men having large private fortunes. Diplomacy a Handmaid of Commercial Intercourse and Peace. The diplomacy of the present ad ministration has sought to respond to modern Ideas of commercial inter course. This policy has been charac terized as substituting dollars for bul lets. It Is one that appeals alike to idealistic humanitarian sentiments, to the dictates of sound policy and strat egy and to legitimate commercial aims. It Is an effort frankly directed to the increase of American trade upon the axiomatic principle that the gov ernment of the United States shall ex tend all proper support to every legiti mate and beneficial American enter prise abroad. How great have been the results of this diplomacy, coupled with the maximum and minimum pro vision of the tariff law, will be seen by some consideration of the wonder ful Increase in the export trade of the United States Because modern di plomacy Is commercial there has been a disposition in some quarters to at' tribute to it none but materialistic aims. How strikingly erroneous is such an impression may be seen from a study of the results by which the diplomacy of the United States can be judged. Successful Efforts In Promotion of . Peace. Ia the field of work toward the Ideals of peace this government negotiated, but to my regret was unable to con summate, two arbitration treaties which set the highest mark of the aspiration of nations toward the sub - as; stitution of arbitration and reason for war In the settlement of International disputes. Through the efforts of American diplomacy several wars have been prevented or ended. I re fer to the successful tripartite media tion of the Argentine Republic, Bra zil, and the United States between Peru and Ecuador, the bringing of the boundary dispute between Panama and Costa Rica . to peaceful arbitra tion; the staying of warlike prepara tions when Haiti and the Dominican Republic were on the verge of hostil ities; the stopping of a war In Nicara gua; the halting of internecine strife to Honduras. VXh - government , of the - United States was thanked for Its Influence toward the restoration of amicable re lations between the Argentine Republic, and Bolivia. The diplomacy of the United Stares is active in seeking to assuage the remaining ill feeling be tween this country and the republic of Colombia. In the recent civil war in China the United States successfully joined with the other interested powers in urging an early cessation ef hostili ties. An agreement has been reached between the governments of Chile and Peru whereby the celebrated Tacna Arica dispute, which has so long em bittered international relations on the west coast of South America, has at last been adjusted. Simultaneously came the news that the boundary dis pute between Peru and Ecuador had entered upon a stage of amicable set tlement. China. In China the policy of encouraging financial investment to enable that country to help itself has had the result of giving new life and practical appli cation to the open door policy. The consistent purpose of the present ad ministration has been to encourage the use of American capital in the develop ment of China by the promotion of those essential reforms to which China Is pledged by treaties with the United States and other powers. The hypothecation to foreign bankers In connection with certaia Industrial enterprises, such en the Hukuang rail ways, of the national revenues upon which these reforms depended, led the department of state early in the admin istration to demand for American citi zens participation in such enterprises in order that the United States might have equal rights and an equal voice in all questions pertaining to the disposi tion of the public revenues concerned The same policy of promoting inter national accord among the powers hav ing similar treaty rights as ourselves In he matters of reform, which could not )e put into practical effect without the ommon consent of all, was likewise adopted in the case of the loan desired by China for the reform of its cur rency. The principle of international co-operation in matters of common In terest upon which our policy had a I ready been based in all of the above In stances has admittedly been a great factor In that concert of the powers which has been so happily conspicuous during the perilous period of transition through which the great Chinese nation has been passing. Central America Needs Our Help In Debt Adjustment. - In Central America, the aim has been to help such countries as Nicaragua and Honduras to help themselves They are the .immediate beneficiaries. The national .benefit to the United States is twofold. First It is obvious that the Monrce doctrine. Is more vital in the neighborhood of the Panama canal and the zone of the Caribbean than any where else There, too. the mainte nance of that doctrine fails most heav ily -upon the United States.- It Is there tar "esential that the countries withia. Changes Suggested In Tariff Laws to Aid Commerce. 

FLAT RATES ARE FAILURES. that sphere shall be removed from the Jeopardy Involved by heavy foreign debt and chaotic national finances and from the ever present danger of inter national complications due to disorder at home. Hence the United States has been glad to encourage and support Ameri can bankers who were willing to lend a helping hand to the financial re habilitation of such countries because this financial rehabilitation and the protection of their custom bouses from being the prey of would be dictators would remove at one stroke the men ace of foreign creditors and the men ace of revolutionary disorder. I wish to call your especial attention to the recent occurrences In Nicaragua, for I believe the terrible events re corded there during the revolution of the past summer the useless loss of life, the devastation of property, the bombardment of defenseless cities, the killing and wounding of women and children, the torturing of noncoaabat ants to exact contributions and the suffering of thousands of human be ings might have been averted bad the department of state, through approval of the loan convention by the senate. been permitted to carry out Its now well developed policy of encouraging the extending of financial aid to weak Central American states with the pri mary objects of avoiding just such revolutions by assisting these repub lics to rehabilitate their finances, to establish their currency on a Btable basis, to remove the custom houses from the danger of revelutions by ar ranging for their secure administra tlon, and to establish reliable banks. I wish to congratulate the officer and men of the United States navy and marine corps who took part In re-estab lishing order in Nicaragua upon their splendid conduct and to record with sorrow the death ef seven American marines and bluejackets. Since the re establishment of Peace and order elec tlons have been held amid canditions of quiet and tranquillity. Nearly all the American marines have new been withdrawn. Our Mexican Policy. For two years revolution and counter revolution have distraught the neigh boring republic of Mexico. Brigandage has involved a great deal of depreda tion upon foreign interests. There have constantly recurred questions of ex treme delicacy. On several occasions very difficult situations have arisen on our frontier. Throughout this trying period the policy of the United States has been one of patient noninterven tion, steadfast recognition of constitut ed authority in the neighboring na tion and the exertion of every effort to care for American interests. I pro foundly hope that' the Mexican nation may soon resume the path of order. prosperity and progress. To that na tion ' In Its sore troubles the sympa thetic friendship of the United States has been demonstrated to a high de gree. There were In Mexico at the begin ning of the revolution some 30.000 or 40.000 American citizens engaged in enterprises contributing greatly to the prosperity of that republic and also benefiting the Important trade between the two countries. The Investments of. American capital In Mexico has been estimated at $1,000,000,000. The respon sibility of endeavoring to safeguard those interests and the dangers Insep arable from propinquity to so turbulent a situation have been great, but I am happy to have been able to adhere to the policy above outlined a policy which I hope may soon be justified by the complete success .of the Mexican people In regaining the blessings of peace and good order. Agricultural Credits. A most important work accomplished in the past year by the American dip lomatic officers in Europe Is the inves tigation of the agricultural credit sys tem in the European countries. Both as a means to afford relief to the con sumers of this country through a more thorough development of agricultural resources and as a means of more suffi ciently maintaining the agricultural population, the project to establish credit facilities for the farmers is a concern of vital Importance to this na tion No evidence of prosperity among well established farmers should blind us to the fact that lack of capital Is prevent ing a development of the nation's agri cultural resources and an adequate in crease of the land under cultivation: that agricultural production is fast fall-' ing behind the increase in population and that, in fact, although these well established farmers are maintained In increasing prosperity because of the natural Increase In population, we are not developing the industry of agricul ture. . - Advantage of Maximum and Minimum Tariff Provision. The Importance which our manufac- tare hava assumed in tha comnaarca 1 of the world In competition with the manufactures of other countries again draws attention to the duty of this government to use Its utmost endeav ors to secure Impartial treatment for American products in all markets. Healthy commercial rivalry In Interna' tlonal intercourse la best assured by the possession of proper means for protecting and promoting our foreign trade. It Is natural that competitive countries should view with some con cern this steady expansion of our com merce. If In some instances the meas ures taken by them to meet It are not entirely equitable a remedy should be found. In former messages I have described the negotiations of the department of state with foreign governments for the adjustment of the maximum and mini mum tariff as provided In section 2 of the tariff law of 1909. The advantages secured by the adjustment of our trade relations under this law have contin ued during the last year, and some ad ditional cases of discriminatory treat ment of which we had reason to com plain have been removed. The depart ment of state has for the first time In the history of this country obtained substantial most-favored-nation treat ment from all the countries of the world. There are, however, other Instances which, while apparently not constitut ing undue discrimination in the sense of section 2, are nevertheless excep tions to the complete equity of tariff treatment for American products that the department of state - consistently has sought to obtain for American commerce abroad. . Necessity For Supplementary Legisla- tion. These developments confirm the opin ion conveyed to you in my annual mes sage of 1911. that while the maximum and minimum provision of the tariff law ef 1909 has been fully justified by the success achieved In removing pre viously existing undue discriminations igainst American products, yet experi ence has shown that this feature of the law should be amended in such way as to provide a fully effective means of meeting the varying degrees of discriminatory treatment of Ameri can commerce in foreign countries still encountered, aa well as to protect against injurious treatment on the part of foreign governments through either legislative or administrative measures the financial interests abroad ef Ameri can citizens whose enterprises enlarge the market for American commodities I cannot too strongly recemmttid to the congress the passage of some such enabling measure as the bill which was recommended by the secretary of state in his letter of Dec. 13, 1911. The ob ject ef the proposed legislation Is. In brief, te enable the executive to apply, as the case may require, te any or all commodities, whether or net on the free list from a country which discrim inates ageinst the United States, a graduated scale of duties up to the maximum of 25 per cedt ad valorem provided in the present law. Flat tariffs are out of date. Nations no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other nations Irrespective of the treatment from them received. Such a flexible power at the command of the executive would serve to moderate any unfavorable tendencies on the part of those countries from which the impor tations into the United States are sub stantially confined te articles on the free list as well as of the countries which find a lucrative market in the United States for their products under existing custom rates. It is very neces sary that the American government should be equipped with weapons of negotiation adopted to modern econom ic conditions In order that we may at all times be in a position to gain not only technically just but actually eqult able treatment for our trade and also for American enterprises and vested In terests abroad. Business Secured to Our Country by Direct Official Effort. As Illustrating the commercial bene fits to the nation derived from the new diplomacy and Its effectiveness upon the material as well as the more Ideal side. It may be remarked that through direct official efforts alone there have been obtained in the course of this administration contracts from foreign governments Involving an expenditure ef $50,000,000 in the factories of the United States. It is germane to these observations to remark that in the two years that have elapsed since tho successful negotia tion of" our new treaty with Japan, which at the time seemed to present so many practical difficulties, our export trade to that country has increased at the rate of over $1,000,000 a month. Our exports to Japan for the year end ed June 30. 1910. were $21,959,310. while for the year ended June 30. 1912, the exports were $53,478,046. a net In crease in the sale of American prod ucts of nearly 150 per cent. The act adopted at the last session of congress to give effect to the fur seal convention of July 7. 1911. between Great Britain. Japan. Russia and the United States provided for the sus pension of all land killing of seals on the Pribilof Islands for a period of five years, and an objection bas now been presented to this provision by the other parties in interest, which raises the issue as to whether or not this prohibition of land killing is inconsist ent with the spirit if not the letter of the treaty stipulations. The justifica tion for establishing this close season depends, under the terms of the con- tttia. noon how far If at all it Is necessary for protecting and preserv ing the American fur seal herd and for increasing its number. This is a ques tion requiring examination of the pres ent condition of the herd and the treat ment which it needs in the light of actual experience and scientific inves tigation. Final Settlement ef North Atlantio Fisheries Dispute. On the 20th of July last an agree ment was concluded between the Unit ed States and Great Britain adopting, with certain modifications, the rules and method of procedure recommend ed in the award rendered by the North Atlantic coast fisheries arbitration tri bunal on Sept 7, 1910, for the settle ment hereafter, in accordance with the principles laid down in the award, of questions arising with reference to the exercise of the American fishing liberties under Article I of the treaty of Oct. 20. 1818. between the United States and Great Britain. This agree ment received the approval of the sen ate on Aug. 1 and was formally rati fied by the two governments on Not. 15 last. Opium Conference Unfortunate Fail ure of Our (aovernment. In my message on foreign relations communicated to the two bouses of congress Dec. 7, 1911. I called special attention to the assembling of the opium conference at The Hague, to the fact that that conference was to review all pertinent muncipal laws relating to the opium and allied evils and certain ly all international rules regarding these evils, and to the fact that it seemed to me most essential that the congress should take immediate action on the anti-narcotic legislation before the con gress, to which I had previously called attention by a special message. The congress at Its present session should enact Into law those bills now before it whlcfi have been so carefully drawn up in collaboration between the department of state and the other ex ecutive departments and which have behind them not only the moral senti ment of the country, but the practical support of all the legitimate trade in terests likely to be affected. Since the international convention was signed adherence to it has been made by sev eral European states not represented at the conference of The Hague and also by seventeen Latin-American re publics. Europe and tha Near East. The. war between Italy and Turkey came to a close in October last by the signature of a treaty of peace, subse quently to which the Ottoman empire renounced sovereignty over Cyrenaica and Tripolitania in favor of Italy. Dur ing the past year the near east has un fortunately been the theater of con stant hostilities. Almost simultaneous ly with the conclusion of peace be tween Italy and Turkey and their ar rival at an adjustment of the complex questions at Issue between them, war broke out between Turkey on the one hand and Bulgaria, Greece, Montene gro and Servla on the other. In the exercise of my duty in the matter I have dispatched to Turkish waters a special service squadron, con sisting of two armored cruisers. In or der that this government may if need be bear its part In such measures as It may be necessary for the Interested na tions to adopt for the safeguarding of foreign lives and property in the Otto man empire in the event that a danger ous situation should develop. Liberia. As a result of the efforts ef this gov ernment to place the government of Liberia in position to pay its outstand ing indebtedness and te maintain a stable and efficient government, nege tiations for a loan of $1,700,000 have been successfully concluded, and It is anticipated that the payment of the old loan and the issuance of the bonds of the 1912 loan for the rehabilitation of the finances of Liberia will follow at an early date, -when the new receiver ship will go into active operation. The new receivership will consist of a gen eral receiver of customs designated by the government ef the United States and three receivers of customs desig nated by the governments of Germany. France and Great Britain, which coun tries have commercial interests In the republic of Liberia. The Far East. The political disturbances In China in the autumn and winter of 1911-12 resulted in the abdication of the Man chu rulers on Feb. 12. followed by the formation of a provisional republican government empowered to conduct the affairs of the nation until a permanent government might be regularly estab lished. The natural sympathy of the American people with the assumption of republican principles by the Chinese people was appropriately expressed in a concurrent resolution of congress on April 17. 1912. A constituent assembly, composed of representatives duly chosen by the people of China in the elections that are now being held, has been called to meet in January next to adopt a permanent constitution and organize the government of the nascent repub lic. During'the formative constitutional stage and pending definite action byj the assembly, as expressive of the popular will, and the hoped for estab lishment of a Stable republican form of government capable of fulfilling its International obligations, the United States is, according to precedent, main taining full and friendly de facto re lations with the provisional govern ment. idc new condition oi anairs tnus i created has presented many serious and complicated problems, both of In ternal rehabilitation and of interna tional relations, whose solution it was realized would necessarily require mucb time and patience. From tha beginning of the npbeaval last autumn ' It was felt by the United States, in common with the other powers having large interests In China, that inde pendent action by the foreign govern ments In their own Individual Inter ests would add further confusion to a situation already complicated. A pol icy of International co-operation was accordingly adopted In an -understanding, reached early in the disturbances, to act together for the protection of the lives and property of foreigners If menaced, to maintain an attitude of strict Impartiality as between the con tending factions and to abstain from any endeavor to Influence the Chinese in their organization of a new form of government. It was futher mutually agreed. In the hope of hastening an end to hos tilities, that none of the Interested pow ers would approve the making of loans by its nationals to either side. As soon, however, as a united provisional gov ernment of China was assured, the United States joined In a favorable consideration of that government's re quest for advances needed for imme diate administrative necessities and later for a loan to effect a permanent national reorganization. The interested governments bad already, by common consent, adopted, in respect to the pur poses, expenditure and security of any loans to China made by their nationals, certain conditions which were held to be essential, not only to secure reason able protection for the foreign invest ors, but also to safeguard and strength en China's credit by discouraging Indis criminate borrowing and by insuring the application of the funds toward tha establishment of the stable and effec tive government necessary to China's welfare. In June last representative banking groups of the United States, France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan and Russia formulated, with the general sanction of their respective govern ments, the guaranties that would be expected In relation to the expenditure and security of the large reorganization loan desired by China, which, however, have thus far proved unacceptable to the provisional government. The Cuban Situation. The republic of Cuba last May was in the throes of a lawless uprising that for a time threatened the destruction of a great deal ef valuable property much--of It owned by Americans and ' other foreigners as well as the exist ence of the government Itself. Tha armed force of Cuba being inadequate to guard property from attack and at the same . time properly to operate against the rebels, a force of American marines was dispatched from our naval station atGuantanamo Into the pro vines of Oriente for the protection of Ameri can and other foreign life and property. The Cuban government was thus able to use all Its forces In putting down the outbreak, which it succeeded In doing in a period of six weeks. The presence of two American warships In the har bor of Havana during the most critical period of this disturbance contributed in great measure to allay the fears of the inhabitants, including a large for eign colony. Necessity For Retention and Expan sion of Our Foreign Trad. It la not possible to make to the con gress a communication upon the pres ent foreign relations of the United States so detailed as to convey an adequate Impression of the enormous Increase In the importance and activi ties of those relations. If this govern ment is really to preserve to the Amer ican people that free opportunity In foreign markets which will soon be in dispensable to our prosperity, even greater efforts must be made. Conclusion. Congress should fully realize tha conditions which obtain tn the world as wo find ourselves at the threshold of our middle age as a nation. We havo emerged full grown as a peer in the great concourse of nations. We have passed through various formative periods. We have been self centered in the struggle to develop our do mestic questions. The nation Is now too mature to continue In its foreign relations those temporary expedient natural to a people to whom domestic affairs are the sole concern. In the past our diplomacy has often consisted. In normal times. In a mere assertion of the right to International existence. We are now in a larger re lation with broader rights of our own and obligations to others than our selves. A number of great guiding principles were laid down early In the history of this government. The recent task of our diplomacy bas been to ad just tbose principles to the conditions of today, to develop their corollaries, to find practical applications of the old principles expanded to meet new situations. The opening of the Panama canal will mark a new era In our Interna tional life and create new and world wide conditions which, with their vast correlations and conseqaences, will ob tain for hundreds of years to come. We must not wait for events to over take us unawares. With continuity of purpose we must deal with the prob lems of our external relations by a diplomacy modern, resourceful, mag nanimous and fittingly expressive of the high Ideals of a stent nation.
