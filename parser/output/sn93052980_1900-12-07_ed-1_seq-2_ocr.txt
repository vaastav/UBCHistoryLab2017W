America's most headstrong patriots and, withal, a good old-fashioned President, as well as a tough, unbending hickory Democrat, -enunciated" the doctrine that "To the victor belongs the spoils." Our county Democratic ring after steadfastly ".adhering to this time-honored doctrine up to the^6th of 'November, 1900, came suddenly to the conclusion that this doctrine, was not in tia'rniony with the present trend of events, and pro ceeded to arrange matters for the incoming Republican Board of Supervisors. But "the best laid schemes o'.mice and : men gang aft aglee." It is reported on .good authority that repeated efforts were made by the Democratic "powers behind the throne" to induce the holdover Republican member of the Board of • Supervisors to consent to a "fix-up" of the appointive posi tions by the outgoing Board, so as to tie the hands of the new Board as far as these offices were concerned! In other words, to usurp the just prerogative of the new Board and. dispense the patronage that of right belonged to -it. The trap was cleverly. laid and. the plans skillfully carried out until the final throw,, when, to their utter dismay and political undo ing, they found that no Republican would lend himself to ,- any such intrigue. The heretofore high-handed, rule or ruin ring found itself up against the real thing, and such a humil iating scramble for cover has seldom been witnessed, and to this hour every leader of the besmirched party vociferously and vehemently disclaims having anything to do with the | disgraceful' affair. Be that as it may, the Hospital Steward, County Physician and at least one other officer were evidently asked to resign, and the two former sent in their, resignations in \ time to give the old Board a chance to accept them and fill the vacancies ' thus occasioned, i These officials v who have been well paid for their services by the people, would not con tinue in office until the new Board was organized and had an opportunity to fill vacancies after mature deliberation, and to the best interest of taxpayers, but threw up their public trust and demanded that their resignations be accepted and their suc cessors be appointed at once. If they were not doing this at the behests of the Democratic; intriguers and under great pressure, and as part of the usurping scheme, nothing can be judged by actions, and "actions speak louder than words.-ll Clearly they should have remained in office until the people, through their, chosen representatives, had a fair opportunity to select other public servants to take their respective places, and it is fair to presume that they would have acted the fair and better part had they not been importuned to do otherwise. All fair-minded men, be they Democrats or Republicans, like fair play, and to , attempt thus to take "advantage, by trickery, of the party which had fairly won the "battle of bal lots/ and.been entrusted by the people with the management of county affairs, not only merits the contempt of all good citizens, but should and will sound ; the death-knell of the 1 Democratic ring that has so long controlled with a high hand theaffairs "of Amador county. The people of this county gave notice on Nov. 6th that they had already. had all they^wanted of ring, rule, and' ; this last piece of trickery will only serve to strengthen them in their resolve to be rid of it forever. Gentlemen, the hand ■-■■ writing is on the wall; read it and prepare to step down and -out gracefully when the day of righteous judgment arrives. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. • . _- ptig , : „ — -•:;:■-■ ■ - ■ ["'President McKinley's message is a businesslike docu- I ment in which foreign affairs are handled in a masterly manner. No one can fail to admire the high statesmanship displayed all through the Chinese and other crises. ,"•:,* The message in its discussion of financial affairs of great importance is very strong and all that could be desired. The Nicaragua canal matter might have been couched in rather more emphatic terms, but the reiteration of the necessity of ratifying the Hay-Pauncefote treaty shows plainly enough .i that the. President is in line "with "the enterprise for we cannot build the canal, without being guilty of gross bad faith, uptil said treaty is ratified. :-'/ The President strongly recommends : the j laying of the Pacific cable, and this recommendation will doubtless have the desired effect on Congress. k-jjy r. As a whole, the message justly takes rank with the 1 ablest documents of the kind on record. •It is understood that later President McKinley will, in a message, make a strong plea for the immediate con struction of the Nicaragua canal.
