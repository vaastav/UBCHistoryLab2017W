Why foroo the negro In the very nostrils of tbe Southern man whose submlelon to law yoa seek I- Is It said theoath requires no more than that? Wilh all doe respect to Mr. Lincoln it requires a great deal more. It requires tbe top put of a proo'amvlon which ne half of tbe people of the North do not support. It re quires tbe support of laws which one half of the people of the North repndUte ae null and void, beoauee unconstitutional. The doo trine is not yet forced on Amerlosna that the mast obey a law ontll it is deolared onoon titntlooal, This proclamation requires the taking of an oath, as a condition of pardon, wbiob half tbecit'seus of the Northern States wonld refuse to take. It is true that tbe Presi dent may proffer psrdon oo coadl lona. But the question ia whether bla conditions are wlie, prsoiio.l, likely to do good. We are very muoa afraid ibat the Administration knows no more bow to make peace tban It has hereto fore seemed to know abont making war. We ace no prospect oi peace or good to the country in Ibe Pieildent's plan On tbe ooatrary, we fear be has thrown away a golJen opportunity for the oonntry, for the aake of winnlug a an,e porl among Northern radicals for himself.

The conditions oi paraon wnico he f ffors will rather still innoer unimeme re bellion than withdraw supporters from it, where as tbe rebellion ia ust now in that condition when nenerous terms would have won tens of thousands Iron its support.
