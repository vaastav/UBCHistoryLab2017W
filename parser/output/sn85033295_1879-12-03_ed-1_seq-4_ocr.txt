g!(c gcpublkdti. W S -XESI \\Y,T)EC. 8,1879. The decrease of the public debt of the United States during November was $799,823. The Forty-sixth congress reassembled for its Winter session at noon Monday. The annual message of the president and the reports of the heads of depart ments were submitted. We print the message in another part of this [paper. The present destitution and distress in Ireland are represented by a London dis patch as worse than have been known in that unfortunate country since the great fhmine of thirty years ago. Collections are to be taken in all the Catholic churches of London next Sunday for the relief of the distressed. The president sent a large number of appointments to the senate on Monday, and among them Hon. George W. Mc- Crary, of lowa, as United States judge of fire eight circuit, vice Dillon, resigned. There are 150 supervisors of the cen sbs to be appointed in the several states before the first of January, and the pres sure on the president by applicants for these positions is immense. Four of these appointments will fall to Wisconsin,there being that number of districts in the state. The German postmaster general is pre paring a proposal to be presented to the reichstag by which the postotfice depart ment will take charge of the entire freight traffic of the German railroads. In this country the postofiice department is not far behind, as the mails are now access ible to almost everything. Some of the congressmen in Washing twn predict a long and exciting sessioc. They say the republicans arc flushed with victory, aud will be perpetually saying rasping things about the democrats,which will stir up the hot-heads aud start a flood of political squabbling which may last for six months or a year. If these predictions are fullfilled it will once moie become evident that Providence is on the akic of the republican party. Another veteran officer of the United States army has been called to join the great army of the dead—General Jeffer son C. Davis, who served gallantly through the war against the rebellion, and has remained in the service ever since. He was a native of Indiana and over 50 years of age. He died lust Sun day afternoon at the Palmer House, Chicago, where he was stopping tempo rarily, of a complication of diseases, un der which he had been suffering more or less for several years. His bereaved wife who was at his bedside when he died,has the sincere sympathy of all. The shot gun argument still prevails in the south, the latest subject of attack being William A. Nix, a brother of post master Nix, of Blackville, S. C., who was shot and dangerously wounded a few days ago by a ruffian named Barney Jeff court. The motive for this act is believ ed to be that Nix was suspected of being a witness against Jeffcourt, for a violation of the revenue laws. Political prejudice is charged by the republicans to be the cause of the shooting. Nix is not expect ed to live. The actual returns of the present years crops in the south show that the cotton yield is larger by 500.000 bales than ever before in the days of slavery. The tobac co is greater by 12,000,000 pounds than last year, and the production of sugar ex ceeds by 200,000 hogsheads that of 1878. These figures show why so many of the people of the south aro not quite willing to join Bob Toombs in crying ‘'death to the union.” The union has proved to be a profitable piece of political machinery, and the returning sense of the southern people will, in time, lead them to aban don the state rights nonsense, and to fall in line with the rest df the republic in the onward march to permanent prosperi ty and happiness. Secretary Sherman has no doubt whatever of the permanency of resump tion. He says there is more gold and silver in the treasury now than there was when resumption began. The only diffi culty is to keep down the accumulation t a reasonable figure. When the corres pondent of The Cincinnati Commercial, to whom he had made these assertions, asked him about the prospect for the con tinuance of the present prosnerity of the country, he replied: “I see no reason why it should not continue. In looking over the country at our immense resour ces, and considering the energetic, hardy character of our people, we can see no reason to believe but what the United Skates are on the eve of a series of years of unexampled prosperity. We have Tml a long and severe season of depres sion, in length and severity almost, if BDt quite, unexampled in our history. There is a law of compensation running through all things. Taking everything into consideration, it really seems to me flat we are to have a long run of solid prosperity.” 

SOUTHERN LA WLESSNESS. One of the most striking features of the report of Mr. Raum, the commissioner e,V' internal revenue, is that part relating to crime in the southern states against the revenne 1 aw. I )urin g the last three years and four months, three thousand one hun dred and seventeen illicit distilleries have been seized, six thousand three hundred and fifty-three persons arrested for illict distilling, and twenty-seven officers and employes killed and forty-eight wounded while engaged in enforcing the internal revenue laws. During the last sixteen months three thousand two hundred and eighty-one persons have been arrested,and one thousand four hundred and ninety five still seized, five officers have been killed, and twenty-three wounded. Of these crimes, ninety-one one-hundredths have been committed in the south. One hundred and sixty-five United States offi cers have been arrested in the south by shite authorities while in the discharge of their duty, in order to prevent them from enforcing the laws. The commissioner says: “My information is, and I am of the opinion that very nearly, if not quite all of these prosecutions, are without pro bable cause, and are instituted as a means of obstructing the enforcement of the laws and these facts afford additional evidence of the difficulties in the way of collecting the internal revenue.” These crimes are tire natural outgrowth of the political heresy of state rights. The federal officials are looked upon by the majority of the southern white men as in truders; invaders of the southern soil whose lives may justly pay the forfeit of their temerity. These views arc not enter tained alone by the ignorant and ruffianly class, but it is encouraged by men like Hampton and Lamar, who play upon the southern prejudice for state rights. It is countenanced by men in power, and the result is that the United States laws are disregarded as much in the payment of taxes as they are in the protection of per sonal and property rights. Congress met on Monday. The presi dent's message was presented and read, and an adjournment was then had. It remains to be seen what the democratic programme is to be. If the policy which that party pursued during the extra ses sion is to prevail this winter, a stormy session may be expected. If the conser vative and cool headed members among the democrats can have their way, they will profit by the result of the recent elections and stop making capital for the republicans. But it is doubtful whether the hot heads can be subdued. By aban doning their schemes of the extra session and pursuing a different course, they ad mit that they were then in the wrong; by going ahead in their revolutionary move ments, they make themselves still more odious with the people. So that which ever horn of the dilemma they may take, they do not seem to have very flattering prospects ahead. Show this to Your Doctor. Cleveland, Nov. 1, 1878. Editors “ T Vachter am Erie,'’ Ch reload. Ohio. Gentlemen: —Allow me, as a old reader of your valuable journal, herewith to send you a few lines, which please in sert in your next issue. I will vouch for their truth, and know that by their pub lication a great deal of good will be ac complished- Having been a reader of your paper for many years, I hope you will kindly grant my request. For twelve years I had suffered, from time to time, terribly of Rheumatism, to such an extent that I was unable to move about and lost the use of my limbs. I tried everything recommended to effect a cure, consulted some of the most promi nent physicians,and expended large sums of money, hoping to find relief, but with out any success. Glancing over the. columns of The Wachfcr, I read about the St. Jacobs Oil and the many cures this remedy had effected. Having been disappointed so many times, I lost all faith in any remedy, the St. Jacobs Oil included, until I saw one day that it had cured a well-known citizen with whom I am acquainted. Other parties fully en dorsed the value and wonderful power of the Oil, telling me that it had cured them of different ailments in a very short time. This brought me to a conclusion. I said to myself, “Schweizer, fifty cents won't break you;” so I went to my drug gist, Mr. Bock, bought a bottle of the Oil, and must now confess that the re sult was truly wonderful. I used it every two hours, and found relief immediately upon the first application, and the pain ceased entirely after a few more applica tions. Fearing another attack, I remain ed in bed and continued to use the re medy every three hours. All having left me, I arose from my bed and walked down stairs without any trouble. Since that time I have been able to fol low my occupation and feel no pains or inconvenience, however disagreeable the changes of the weather may be. Having thoroughly tested the St. Jacobs Oil, I can conscientiously recommend it to all afflicted with Rheumatism. Fifty cents is a small expense when the services for so trifling an outlay are considered. If I was one thousand miles away from all human habitation, I should, nevertheless, procure this remedy and keep it always in my house. Louis Schweitzer, Cor. Mervin and Center Sts., Cleve land, O.

'i'U : k -M)UKDS AT AZTALAN. * rom Madison Journal, November 26th. The following interesting letter, written by the late Edward Everett, to Honorable N. F. Hyer, of Jefferson, we believe never before published, has been placed in our hands to be by us deposited among the archives of the State Histori cal Society. It will possess a peculiar in terest to archaeologists and all who have studied the mound formation found in so many localities in our State, and particu larly at Atzalan, to which the letter prin cipally relates. It will be seen that Mr. Everett had made the subject of the Mound Builders a study, but we have to reflect that the subject is as problematical now as it was more than forty years ago when this letter was written/ Hon. N.F. Hyer, to whom the letter was addressed and who had interested himself in the curious remains to which the letter re lates, is probably well known to many of our readers. He is one of the pioneers of Wisconsin, and was a Dane county member of the first Constitutional Con vention which met in this city, then vil lage, on the sth of October, 1846: Boston, 28th May, 1838. Dear Sir: —l received, a few days since, your interesting letter of the 30th April, containing an account of “the ruins of the ancient city of Aztalan.” The subject of these ruins had already at tracted my notice, as I had seen them de scribed in the papers of your territory; and I feel particularly obliged to Mr. Parks for proposing to you to write tome, and not leas so to yourself for kindly tak ing that trouble. The problem relative to the construc tion of the class of works, of which those in question are a most important speci men, has thus far resisted solution. If the truth is ever to be reached, it must be by means of a patient and diligent collection of the facts and an examina tion and delineation of all the remains of this kind. The public are under great obligations to you, for the pains you have taken to extend a knowledge of these very curious mounds and structures. That North America was once inhabit ed by a people far more civilized than the tribes found here by our forefathers,seems beyond doubt. Whether this race was that of which faint memorials are preserv ed in the Mexican hioroglypical manu scripts (as seems to have been assumed in giving the name of Aztalan to the ruins in question); whether it was some other people to whom ajl tradition has perished, but of which *hese mysterious erections remain as monuments: or whether finally the tribes found in North America by the first European settlers are degenerate and broken down remains of more improved ancient races which preceded them (an opinion which has found advocates), arc questions, I think, which we want the materials as yet to discuss satisfactorily. We must content ourselves, at present, with collecting and recording facts. 1 trust by all means these highly im portant remains will be preserved. If they are situated on unsold puplic land, it is greatly to be desired that the tracts on which they lie should be reserved ( from sale. lam persuaded the Presi j dent ol the United States, on a proper re presentation, would so order. If they are already private property, the intelli gence and liberality of their proprietors must interpose to protect from the plow the last remains of a powerful race. 1 am convinced the owners of the soil would find their account in so doing, tor these ruins will prove a great attraction to travelers. I have for sonic time intended, when I shall be freer from public engagements, to make another visit to the West, and particularly to Wisconsin Territory. A desire to see these and other similar re mains is one of my motives. Avery lively impression of the splendid destin ies which await the West in another, still stronger. I have been led by this feeling to acquire a small stake in its prosperity. In making a small investment, of proper ty in your territory, I have not been ac tuated by a view to speculation and large pecuniary profit. I shall be perfectly content if it is unattended with loss. But I have been desirous myself and my children to posses a few acres in this mighty field of plenty and promise;and I take pleaure in the consciousness that I already feel, as the owner of a portion of the soil, a personal interes t in the welfare and advancement of its inhabitants. I am too old, myself, to come among them, and am besides bound by very strong ties to my home;but I should be well pleased to have one of my find a home near the Four Lakes, and become identified with the welfare of your youth ful but rapidly growing republic. But I have passed, by perhaps too ab rupt a transition, from the ruins of the past, to the prospects of the future. I shall at all times be most happy to hear from you on the subject of your late let ter, or any other. If I can forward you any publication throwing light on these inquiries, I shall take pleasure in doing so. I am, dear sir, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, Edward Everett. N. F. Hyer, Esq. P. S.—l am desirous of obtaining the best map of Wisconsin. I have that of Messrs. Morrison, Dwillc & Hathaway, published in 1837, but the civil divisions are not laid down in it.

THE BEST REMEDY FOR Diseases of the Throat and Lungs. 1,1 ‘Dscurch of the Z 1 a pulmonary organs a safe wild reliable remedy is inval s) liable.' Ayer’s \ Chkkrv Pectoral is such a remedy. iMm/, It is a scientific C combination of the medicinal princi- CTH pies curative uuLtiuki virtues of the finest _ drugs, chemically united, of such Power as to insure the greatest possi ftrM 1 / ble efficiency, and n T uniformity of re- Avl suits. It strikes at the foundation of all pulmonary diseases, affording prompt relief and rapid cures, and is adapted to patients of any age or either sex. Being very palatable, the youngest children take it readily. In ordinary Coughs, Colds, Sore Throat, Bronchitis, Influenza, Clergyman’s Sore Throat, Asthma, Croup, and Catarrh, the effects of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral are magical, and multitudes are annually preserved from serious ill ness by its timely and faithful use. It should be kept at hand in every house hold for the protection it affords in sud den attacks. In Whooping-cough and Consumption there is no other remedy so efficacious, soothing, and helpful. Low prices are inducements to try some of the many mixtures or syrups, made of cheap and ineffective ingredi ents, now offered, which, as they con tain no curative qualities, can afford only temporary relief, and are sure to disappoint the patient. Diseases of the throat and lungs demand active ami effective treatment; and it is dangerous experimenting with unknown and cheap medicines, from the great liability that these diseases may, while so trifled with, become deeply seated or incurable. Use Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, and you may confidently expect the best results. It is of acknowledged curative power, and is as cheap as its careful preparation and fine ingredients will allow. Emi nent physicians, knowing its composi tion, prescribe it. The test of half a century has proven its certainty to cure all pulmonary complaints not already beyond the reach of human aid.
