S \ ru it DAY, DEOEMJBKli 8. i^OO THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE. Presidential messages, like presi dential elections, have their good points. Upon the convening of each session of Congress it is the custom and duty of the President to inform the Congress of the relations of the government with other gov ernments and of the state of domes tic affairs, with a view to enacting such legislation as the conditions thus disclosed might . require. Thomas Jefferson originated the custom of sending a written mes sage to Congress instead of deliver ing a personal address, and doubt less for the same reason that he also put an effectual stop to the clamor of cabinet officers for the privilege of appearing before Congress to argue and contend for their proposed measures. However, the use of the presidential message to communi cate to Congress such legislation as the executive deems wise and timely is now practically obsolete, and the occasion is rather made one for retrospect and gratulation. For instance, in President McKinley's latest message there is no legislation either specially urged or discouraged, although there are several questions pending of great national portent like the Nicaragua Canal, subsi dies for ships, relations with colonial empire, the trusts, and so on, that might with great propriety be given particular executive weight in one direction or another, but are in fact in the extremest case given only a mild and formatassent. The power the executive will wield in such legislation is therefore not what is derived from a bold and ringing plea to the country for or against pending measures, but from influ ence exerted privately upon mem bers for their support of the admin istration program. Meanwhile the President's message is still extant, and since it no longer serves the purpose of directing legislation it has come to have another meaning, and this it meets admirably. It now simply tells in more or less ornate and loftly phrase the stoiy of the nation's r progress and partici pation in world events and gives the citizen fine ideas of national virtue and justice and purpose, un tainted by partisan sophistry or selfish advantage. In his message the President speaks to the whole country, belongs to the whole country, and for the time being there is no rift or discord in the fair picture of national grandeur and power drawn with such simple dig nity by the hands cho-en to hold the national name highest among all other things in the world.— Lewi s ton Tribune.

PRAISE OF NEVADA. "In the last decade the popula tion of Nevada has fallen off more than 3000, but" says Ambrose Bierce, "Nevada is still populous enough to have a store and a black smith shop, a watering trough, two United States Senators (not very good ones) and brilliant prospects behind it. Its exports last year were three potatoes hurled across the state liue at a California orator denouncing sin. The balance of trade has always been in favor of Nevada, which buys nothing abroad and sells offices to non-residents only. The capital is Carson Cross Roads, but the governor lives in Arizona for his health. The legis lature meets in the Central Pacific Railway office in San Francisco. Nevada is sometimes called 'The Battle-Born State,' because it slip ped into the Union when everybody was watching Pickett's charge at Gettysburg. At that time all the inhabitants, it was said, could have sat in the shade of a single tree, but there was no tree. Now there are two."

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, (Continued from page 1.) RURAL FREE DELIVERY EXTENDED "The continued and rapid growth of the free postal service is a sure index of the great and increasing business activity of the country. This most striking new develop ment is the extension of rural free delivery. This has come almost wholly within the last year. At the beginning of the fiscal year 1899-1900, the number of routes in operation was only 391, and most of these had been running less than twelve months. On the 15th of November, 1900, the number had increased to 2,614, reaching into forty-four States and Territories and serving a population of 1,801, 524. The number of applications now pending and awaiting action nearly equals all those granted up to the present time, and by the close of the current fiscal year about 4,000 routes will have been estab lished, providing for the daily de livery of mails at the scattered homes of about three and a half millions of rural population. This service ameliorates the isolation of farm life, conduces to good roads and quickens and extends the dis semination of general information. Experience thus far has tended to allay the apprehension that it would be so expensive as to forbid its general adoption or make it a general burden. Its actual appli cation has shown that it increases postal receipts and can be accom plished by reductions in other branches of the service, so that the augmented revenuer» and the ac complished savings together mate rially reduce the net cost. The evidences which point to these con elusions arq, presented in detail in the annual report of the postmaster general, which, with its recom mendations, is recommended to the consideration of Congress. The full development of this special ser vice requires such an outlay of money that should be undertaken only after a careful study and thor ough understanding of all that it involves. alaskan boundary. "The work of marking certain provisional boundary points, for convenience of administration, around the head of Lynn canal, in accordance with the temporary rangement of October, 1899, was completed by a joint survey in July last. The modus vivendi has so far worked without .friction and the Dominion government has provided rules and regulations for securing to our citizens the benefit of the recip rocal stipulation that the citizens or subjects of either power found by that agreement within the tempor arv jurisdiction of the other shall suffer 110 diminution of rights and privileges they have hitherto en joyed. But however necessary such an expedient may have been to tide over the grave emergencies of the situation, it is at best but an unsatisfactory makeshift, which should noc be suffered to delay the speedy and complete establishment of the frontier line to which we are entitled under the Russo-American treaty for the cession of Alaska. "In this relation I may refer again to the need of definitely mark ing the Alaskan boundary where it follows the 141st meridian. A con vention to that end has been before the Senate for some two years, but as no action has been, I contem plate negotiating a new convention for a joint determination of the me ridian by telegraphic observations. These, it is believed, will give more accurate and unquestionable results than the sidereal methods hereto fore independently followed, which, as is known, proved discrepant at several points on the line, although not varying at any place more than 700 feet.
