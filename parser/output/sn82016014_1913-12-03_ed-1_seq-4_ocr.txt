PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Wilson's annual message, or address to congress will not attract much attention or discussion because of what ho haa to say on the Mexican question, which appears to be para mount among the questions of the hour, (or ho haa nothing new to say on that subject. He defines the ad ministration's policy towards Mexico as one of watchful waiting for elimin ation of Huerta, whoso collapse ha thinks la not far away, and as one of hope that when his and cornea "con stitutional order will be established in Mexico by tha concert and energy of such of her leaders as prefer the lib erty of their people to their own am bitions. Just what reasons ha has on which to base such hopes he does not give. Surely they cannot be found ed on past performances In Mexico. And it is the consensus of opinion among the best Informed on tha Mexi can situation and itho predominant characteristics of the Mexicans, espec ially their leaders, that the mere elim ination of Huerta la not going to solve the Mexican problem by any means, but this appears to bo the only view in tha premises that is held by the president. v - However, there are a couple of hun dred words in the president's message that are certain "to attract much at tention and provoke much discussion. They convey a suggestion for the re making of the national party conven tions that Is as revolutionary as it is original as far aa national politics is concerned, although it la much the aama in general scope aa the plans on which are now built the state conven tions In Kansas. President Wilson asks congress to enact legislation which will permit of the nomination of presidential candidates at prima ries. He suggests, though, that the nartr conventions be retained, but only for the purpose of declaring and accepting the verdicts of the prima ries and tha formulating of platforms. Ha would do away with the present system of having these conventions made up of delegates chosen merely for this particular purpose. Instead of such delegates he would have the conventions consist of the nominees for congress, the nominees for the va cant seats in the senate, the senators whose terms of office have not yet closed, the members of the national committees, and the candidates for the presidency themselves, "in order," as he says, "that platforms may be framed by those responsible to the people for carrying them into effect." This is a suggestion that is worthy of the careful scrutiny and considera tion of all varieties of politicians. It eliminates with one fell swoop all of the various evils that have been per mitted to creep into the present nation al convention system. Under It, there would be no chance for trickery in the composition of the conventions. The delegates to them would "hold their credentials from the people. There could be no going back of the primary returns. .'It would also appear that the plan would make for a firmer party unity. .And the platforms of such conventions would mean something. The voters would be in no quandary' as to who to hold strictly responsible for any failures to redeem a party's plat form promises. There seems to be only one flaw In tha plan, or rather one feature of it that would not meet one of the impor tant criticisms directed against the present system of assembling national conventions. That concerns the repre sentation that is accorded to what is familiarly called the South. The South would be represented in a convention of Mr. Wilson's making on practically the same basts that it Is now repre sented in national conventions and which la out of all proportions to the vote polled in that section. This ap plies more particularly to the Repub lican convention than to any other, because the Republican vote In the south is an excellent example of noth ing. However, it would eliminate the present methods of controlling this representation, and it Is this question able control that haa engendered the criticism against the Southern repre sentations in the conventions, and es pecially In the Republican one. Another significant feature of the president's message la his call to con gress to devise a plan that will facili tate tha extension of credit to tha far mers. This doesn't mean the extension to the farmers of the credit of the gov ernment itself. The farmers do not ask nor should they be given any such privilege, says President Wilson. What they need, and should obtain," he insists, "is legislation which will make their own abundant and sub stantial credit resources available as a foundation for Joint, concerted - local action in their own behalf in getting the capital they must use." There is much else of import ana Interest in the president's pronounce ment, and It is so briefly and clearly stated I it there la no reason why ev ery one ahould not read It In Its en tirety. This hasn't been the rule witn the presidential messages of late years. 

SENTENCED TO TUBERCULOSIS. In how many prisons doea a sen tenoa carry with it a possible added penalty of tuberculosis T - This is the challenge of the following case wnicn la described in Tha Survey by WiUard Brown Thort: "Five years ago John Gerrish was ti sailor on the United States Cruiser Pennsylvania. Ha waa a young man of good habits, and sent twenty dol lars every month for tha support of his mother In San Diego. Ona day, when on ahora leave at Vallejo, Cat, he did what tor him waa an unprece dented thing got uproariously drunk and beat up a marina who waa his companion. Tha marina accused htm of taking from him a tan dollar bill. "Arraigned !n court,' Gerrish made a poor impression, and his lawyer put up a weak defense. The result was that, despite an unbroken record of previous good behavior, ha was sen tenced to four years In San Quentln prison. . "Ha waa nerving ' his second year when a prominent man in Ban Diego, who had become interested in tha case through the story told by tha mother, visited him in prison, called in person on tha governor, and after long and persistent effort obtained his release on parole. The entire ship's company of the Pennsylvania signed a petition in his behalf. "He waa given employment by his benefactor in the country near San Diego, where he did faithful work. Before long he manifested such abil ity that he was placed in charge of a grading camp. Ha waa finally grant ed a full pardon by the governor, and married and established a little home. "Tuberculosis germs had found lodgment in hia system during his stay In San Quentin, and despite the most favorable climatic conditions in the world, he sickened and died. "The state of California nominally sentenced John Gerrish to four years in the penitentiary. In reality it sen tenced him to death."

Mrs. Bradford) Warren came into the library where her husband, seeking this quiet moment when his wife's house party guests had gone upstairs to bed, was turning the pages of his favorite scientific magazine. "Oh, ray dear, they are Just made for each other, aren't they? . I'm so glad we had them here together," said she. Warren looked up reluctantly frcm the engrossing pages. "Who?" he ask ed suddenly. "Why, that big sculptor friend of yours, John Sands; and Irma Crall. Haven't you noticed?" "Noticed what? "That they were Just made for each other." "If you say so, that's good enough for me," he laughed. "You have noticed it but you won't admit it. Good night." She kissed him and went ud the wide stairs. Warren prodded the dying fire into lire and went on with his maga zine. Meantime above stairs John Sands, his big frame wrapped In .a bathrobe, sat danglinir his feet out of his win dow. The cool October breeze eame gratefully to his hot forehead. Sands wasn't the sort of chap to lose his grip on himself often, but he had to admit he had lost his grip pretty tnorougmy this evening. "It won't do, Johnny." he told him self. "It won't do at all. She's a won derful girl a simply wonderful girl, but girls have ho place In your scheme of life, Just yet. Wait till you're better established. Walt till you're absolute ly sure of yourself. Don't you dare to go dragging any woman through the awful years of uncertainty. Don't let a few successes turn your head. And then he fell to thinking of Irma CraiL He realized if he stayed out the rest of the three days of the house party things might happen- The thing for him to do was to get out at once, in the morning before he saw Iter again. He saw a man moving toward the garage at the rear of the house, sortly be whistled. The man stopped. Sands whi3tled again. The man moved toward him. He saw it was George, one of Warren's two chauffeurs. Sands said softly: "Wait a minute.' Then he swung himself into the room and wrote hurriedly on a bit of paper. This he tossed to the waiting George, together with a coin. 'You go over to the village for the mall very early in the morning, don't you? Well, see that I get this tele gram. In the light streaming out from the library windows Just below he could see the chauffeur grinning. "Surer said George. ' In a room farther down the hall Irma Crail, clad in a long kimono of crimson silk, sat staring at ner reflec tion in the mirror. "It won't do." she said to herself. "I'm losing my head. ' This must stop suddenly. I've said I'd succeed, and I know now I have the voice. It is Just a matter of a few years of abso lute application to work absolute work and no men. But I can't see him again. I'U do something foolish if he talks to ma as he did before the fire in the bail, when we were alone there together to night Just before dinner. I must go away the first thing in the morning." . She took some paper and envelopes from the little .desk in tha corner. Hurriedly she scribbled away, sealed the letter and addressed it to herself. Then she pressed a button in the wall. Presently there came a tap on tha dot r and she opened It to one of the maids. "Ellen," she said, thrusting the let ter and a coin into the maid's hands, "George goes over tor the mail very early in" the morning, doesn't he? Well.

Then they were together in the car, speeding over the hills to the little vil lage and the railroad station. At last they were at the station. The car. had gone whirring back. "Well? Sands question. "Why?" "Why what?" ahe asked almost irrit ably. "Why this sudden flight?" She looked at him squarely. "I have my music," she said. "Don't you under stand?" He nodded.

"You're all right, George," said Sands, and gave the porter a 85 bill. Then he went tearing into the Pullman car. She didn't look up as he stood beside her. Her shoulders moved up and down, and a handkerchief was pressed to her eyes. She was the only passenger in the car. "Is art worth itr he asked abruptly. Her hand sought his and clung to It. "No. no, no I" she sobbed stormlly. "You bet it isn't." he said. And the grinning porter, peeking in from the vestibule, saw him kiss her. The house party guests had gone up stairs.

The news that General Salvador-Mercado, com mander of the federal forces in northern Mexico, has sent a military peace commission from Chihuahua to Juarez to treat with the rebels, while vigorously denied in official circles, is regarded as the most serious blow yet struck at federal prestige. In view of President Huerta's statement that he never would treat with the rebels, it is considered impossible that the peace committee has been sanctioned by him. At the same time it is pointed out that the appointment of the commis sion la in line with the recent sug gestion made by Dr. Aureliano TJrutla when at the head of the ministry of the interior, that overtures might be made to the rebels without govern mental sanction.

The story of how small town gossip wracked a happy home waa told on tha witness stand, hare today by John Richardson, crippled husband of the woman ridden on a rail-, at Volo and left the audi ence' which crowded tha small court room, thoughtful and subdued. Six women are on trial accused of tha attack on Mrs. Richardson. There were smiles when the husband, with his twisted limbs and tha assistance of a stout stick, hobbled from the side of his pretty wife to the witness chair but there were none when he had told hia story, it was a simple story of love and trust and loyalty. . There was no malice or resentment in it. "I don't know why they gosslned about my wife, unless it waa because ahe was pretty," said the witness. We were happy together. I thought that If she went away the gossip would atop and I was Just going to borrow money to send her away when the women attacked her. I waa helpless; I am a cripple and I could not move from my chair when they took her and put her on the rail. I managed to get into my wheel chair but I could not follow them." Counsel for the defense took ud Rich ardson's attempt to borrow money and asked if the money was not to have been used to get a divorce. "No, no." replied the witness. "There waa no need of that. She did not want one and I did not; ahe said she would rather stay and face the gossip, since the assault she has not been home; aha can't very well come back, and I can't leave my business,"

HODGES GAVE PAROLE At Request of the Governor of .Minnesota. For the first time in the history of Kan sas, a governor today paroled a state con vict on the personal request of the gov ernor of another state. The executive the amount of their losses and Saunders' who was today paroled from the Kansas penitentiary by Governor Hodges on the personal request of Governor Adolph Eberhart of Minnesota. Saunders went to the Lansing prison several months ago for passing bad checks in Bourbon county. Since that time the men defrauded have been repaid the amount of their losses and saunders' brother in Minnesota has pleaded with Governor Hodges to grant the forger a parole.
