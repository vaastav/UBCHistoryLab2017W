BIG CRUSADE EXPECTED Resolution Decarc Present Arrange ment Gives Good Representation and Is Free from Politics. The public schools committee of the Chamber of Commerce yesterdav adopt ed a resolution opposing the District Commissioners In their recommendation to Congress that they begin supervision of the District public schools. The Com mittee's resolution will be presented to the directors of the chamber tonight. It was predicted that not only vvill the or ganization adopt the resolution but that the acUon will initiate District-wide op position to the Comml!oners' recom mendation The resolution was presented to the public schools committee by A. Leftvvlch Sinclair and was adopted with but one dissenting vote. It declares the present school law of the District Is an "efficient and satisfactory one and should not be changed." and further says "That tho best Interests of the school children, of the teachers, and of the public require that permanent preerva tlon of the feature of local representa tion In the administration of school gov rnment in the District of Columbia, and that we particularly commend the pro visions of the present law, vesting pow er of appointment of the members of our Hoard of Education in the judges of the Supreme Court of the Dlstgct. as being well calculated to result In the creation of a thorough! representativ e board, free from politics." Point of Difference. The principal points of difference be tween the present system of school gov ernment and the proposed change of the t'ommlssloners. as pointed o'lt b Mr Sinclair, are that three women must erve on the present board, which is not required in the Commissioner', plan, that the apiointinent of the directors bv Jus tices of the District Supreme Court pre cludes the entrance of politics into the appointments since the Justices serve for life, that Congress prescribes the duties and makes the laws of the -cliool sjs tem, while such laws would be abolished and replaced bv those of the Commis sioners' own making, and that a larger repreentatlon is to be had with nine di rectors than with the Ave proposed bv the Commissioners, especially since throe women now serve as directors He also declared a better purpose is served bv the appointment of teachers by the di rectors than would obtain with their ap pointment bj the Commissioners The Chamber of Commerce some years ago was Instrumental in defeating a bill Introduced by Senator Dollier which placed the District's school svstem under the direction of the United States Com- inissinner of Education and gaxc a slmi lar power now asked bv the District I ''ommisiioners I The belting used on machinery in the Russian oil fields Is made of camel's hair, resisting sreai-e better than rubber,, -, i ,t, , ,,.-. ti. leather or cotton ,crltv of. e actor or actress.

IT HERE Was no character I ever I played so whimsical or as full of spirit as Tess of the Storm Country. Whenever I am asked what play, either of the spoken or silent I drama, I like best, I answer without having to ponder upon it Tess. I think my friends all over the world have liked Tess the best, for I hue had hundreds of letters, even f.'om the little children whom I thought would be better pleased with Cinderella. Some of them vote for "Hearts Adrift," but Tess is the one who stands out most vividly. Rags is another harum-scarum, and many hae written that Rags comes second. To me Tess was such a dear be cause she has so many sides to her character. That is what made her so human, and still there was nothing of the namby-pamby about her. There were some keen moments of tragedy in her life, of melting pathos, and yet the most delicious of comedy situa tions. She was deeply religious even in lioae mtj Put Tre nif n r 4"i she wa, nrofene. she iust hadn't the chance to be "teached," as Tess Miriam C, Stamtord, Conn- writes: would say, and, like all little tikes "Pardon my criticism.

One who Is well-balanced becomes a good dancer, snd this very essential hu man attribute balance, or mental poise can be acquired and developed in the dance, but it must not be supposed that the execution of graceful evolutions can be performed without a good deal of preliminary practice, and It Is therefore a capital plan to devote a short period each day to such simple exercises as will limber the Joints and I-npart pliancy to the muscles. These exercises are so simple that they fiercely require an explanation; for in stance, stand firmly upon the floor and slowly raise and lower the body upon the toes: then rale upon the toes, bal ance and rock the body gently from side to side by means of the "Okies only: next lower the bod) to the floor from the hips by unhinging the knee Joints, as It were, next swav the body from fide to side with hip action alone After this it is well to stud) the essentia! po sitions of the feet, inleas this Is cor rectly understood much of the value of dancing Is lost.
