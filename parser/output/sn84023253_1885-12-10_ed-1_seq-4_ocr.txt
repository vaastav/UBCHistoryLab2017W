w (JkMmtimt. St. .Tohnsbury, Vt., Thursday. Dec. 10, 1885. Does This Mean You 1 There are a good many email bills due this office which we urgently ask may be settled at once. Most of the billa are so small that we canngt af ford to go after them, bat the aggregate amount is what we rely on to pay our bills. If this notioe hits you, you are the one it is intended to hit, ANNOUNCEMENT. While many newspapers are giving at this season of the year their annual prospectus, with a review of the past and promises lor the future, Th Cal edonian will simply announce that although in common with almost every other industry it has felt the hard times, yet its subscription list has steadily increased during the year, and that now it is between nine and ten per cent, larger than when the year begun. While this gain may be nothing to boast of, it certainly is something in this year of general depression and gloom for which we are truly thankful, We consider this fact of an in crease of subscribers as the very best evidence that the people like The Caledonian and purpose to snstain it. We think it also proves that hard, honest work in a newspaper is recognized and ap predated by thepublic. The Caledonian has never had so much work put into its columns as during the past year, and we expect to continue to give our readers the coming year their full money's worth regardless of expense or hard times. And now a word to our friends everywhere : If The Caledonian is the kind of a paper that it is desirable to have in a community; if it is worth the while' to sustain a clean, honest, well-printed, care fully edited, wholesome newspaper,.conducted by those who have convictions and who aim to make their utterance speak for the best, let as have your support and also your influence in helping to ex tend its circulation. The Caledonian should be in every family in this county. In what other way can three or four cents a week be spent to better advantage? Fach issue of The Caledonian is evidence that business men understand that its columns are the very best medium to reach customers, as the paper goes into families and is read and preserved. There are but few households within a radius of five miles of this office which it does not enter weekly. It is the best as it is the cheapest means for business men to reach the people. Terms of subscription od the first page. Adver tising rates given on application. Specimen copies sent free. C. M. STONE & CO., Printers and Publishers. If Canon Farrar had left notbing while iu this couutry except the two atll resses from which we give liberal extracts on the inside of this paper, his utterance would have proved of no small value to the current opinion on vital subjects in this land. A sad outcome of the Howgate scau dal in Washington was the application for employment at the agricultural de partment last week by Mrs. Howgate, who was brought up in affluence and was noted not many years ago as the most liberal contributor to local chari ties. Her daughter, a Vassar gradu ate, is employed iu another depart ment. Howgate has never been heard from since he took French leave of Washington some years ago. Commissioner of Indian Affairs At kins, in his annual report, speaks a strong word for the allotment of laud in severalty to the Indians, thus ap proving the stand PresidenfCIeveland has taken on this question. "It should be industriously and gravely impressed upon the Indians," he says, "that they must abandon their tribal relations and take lands in severalty as the cor ner-stone of their complete success in agriculture, which means self-support, personal independence and material thrift." What the average newspaper man doesn't know about doctors and dis ease, medicine and treatment, is hard ly worth knowing. They told us all about Garfield's true condition during his long sickness. Grant's doctors were sized up and sized down without mercy. McLellau's doctors did not escape the reporter's eagle eye, aad now Hendricks' physicians are told what would have saved the late vice president's life or rather what killed him which some one declares was bleeding. Biennial Elections. Senator Edmunds is credited with claiming that the biennial election system in Vermont is not a success or desirable. The worthy senator is cer tainly wrong this time. Vermont lias no notion of going back to the annual election. The present system has proved beneficent and satisfactory to the great mass of people. The people who want to return to the old 83Tstem of .annual elections are limited mainly to those who want to represent their town. If there were annual elections they think their chances would be doubled. A Good Place to Hunt. A correspondent of the Boston Tran script says, that Vermonters are nat ural sportsmen and good shots would appear iu the fact that, notwithstand ing the rough, hilly couutry and spare population, there is hardly more game here than can be found within 25 miles of Boston. Vermont huntsmen have killed it all off. "Three or four par tridges or half a dozen squirrels repre sent a good day's bagging for a keen shot, using a first-class gun, a traiued dog and tramping for miles." Evi dently the Transcript correspondent didu't have good luck. Dividing the Swag. A decided seusation was caused at Washington last week by the exposure that Chairman S. S. Brown of the Maine democratic state committee has been levying money on democrats who have been given post-offices. His letters demanding pay for his services are in Washington and it is said that oue is filed at the White House. The Spring field Republican remarks that "It has been very strongly asserted that some of the men who lay claim to the dis tribution of the patronage in Vermont have taken money for favors." Who can this hit T A Funeral Junket. The Boston Record exposes the jun keting city council who went to Vice President Hendricks' funeral, ostensi bly to do respect to his memory, but really to have a little racket and jolly circus of their own at the expense of the city..-They brought -in a bill of $2000 for the city to pay and the tax payers of Boston will have to pay it. If ten men of the city government wanted to go to Hendricks', funeral they should have paid their own bills, like other people, and it is safe to pre dict that in that case their bills would not have been over $50 apiece, instead of $200. By and by the people are go ing to rebel at such robbery. Science "vs Hydrophobia. One of the most striking iustances of the advancement of science is found in the recent discoveries 6f Chemist Pas teur of Paris, who claims to successful ly treat hydrophobia by an inoculating process. He has so fortified himself in his claims that six children, bitten by a mad dog m Newark, N. J., last week, were at once sent to him by steamer for treatment iu charge of a physician. The children belong to poor families but fnnds were not wanting when their cases were made known. The result of the experiment will be watched with more than ordinary interest. Yielding to Treatment. The Mormon cancer seems to be com ing to a head rather faster than has been anticipated by the friends of de cency.' The government is apprehend ing trouble in Utah. The Mormons, it is said, are in an ugly mood and, now that some of the troops have been withdrawn from the vicinity of Salt Lake City, are more open iu their defi ance of federal authority than ever, There is no question but that,soouer or later, there will be a Mormon rebellion that will have to be suppressed by the military. The Mormon establishment is a house built on the sand aud the sooner the flood conies to wash the "saints" from the face of the country the better. Sir. Tilden Smells Danger. Uncle Sam Tilden has issued a sort of manifesto, or message, or something from Greystone, in the form of a letter to Carlisle, in which he urges that the surplus revenues of the country be ap plied to improving our coast defences. In the 12 principal sea-ports he says that the property exposed to destruc tion cannot be less iu value than $5,- 000,000,000. He declares that "a million of soldiers with the best equipments, on the hights surrounding the harbor of New York, in our present state of preparation, would be powerless to re sist a small squadron of war steamers." This is bad, indeed, aud Uncle Sam's suggestions may be worthy careful consideration, after all. Wars in November. Within the past mouth a war has been in progress between Bulgaria aud Servia ; auother war has been begun and coucluded between England and Burmah ; the revolutionist Caceres has attempted the overturn of the Peruvi an government in South America; a revolution has beeu in progress iu Nu evo Leon, Mexico ; the king of Spain has passed away and a revolution iu that quarter is momentarily expected. Meanwhile Austria serves a notice on Prince Alexander to make uo further advances into Servia ; Russian inter ference is likely to take place any day ; Turkish troops are roaming about in Ruiuelia aud Greece is only waiting for an opportunity to seize Macedonia, while in the Soudan war is an every day aflair. The peace societies are not likelv to tret out of business for some time. THE 49th 

CONGRESS. The 49th congress convened on Mon day. The republicans, having offered the presidency of the senate to Sena tor Logan who positively declined the honor, finally elected Senator Sherman, who was conducted to the chair by Seuator Edmunds. So this matter is settled and well aud wisely settled and talk concerning it is over except among the intensely "good" republicans who are gathering a great deal of comfort from the fact that Senator Edmunds, who declined to allow the use of his name, has been "defeated," as they are pleased to term it. Mr. Carlisle, as was expected, was again chosen speak er of the house. Aside from the drawing of seats, nothing was done the first day aud the president's message was read Tuesday. The 49th congress reports itself "ready for business," and there is business enough on hand. It only remains to be seen whether the winter will be taken up with talk or business. THE 

MESSAGE. President Cleveland's message was published Tuesday. The principle criticism it receives is concerning its extreme length. This prevents even a condensation of the message in this is sue. Foreign affairs and our relation to them are discussed at length. In the domestic affairs of this nation the questions of silver coinage, the tariff and civil service reform are, perhaps. the most important. Then, but hard ly less in importance, comes the navy, Mormouisra, the Indian question and the presidential succession. He argues strongly against the con tinued coinage of overvalued silver dollars. While asserting the necessi ty of reducing the revenue he is hard ly as pronounced on the tariff as ou some other questions. On civil service reform he holds to his well known re form views. The necessity of thor ough reorganization of the navy de partment is also urged. His severe strictures on the Mormon evil will be approved by men of all shades of polit ical opinion. His friendly attitude toward the Indians is strengthened in the renewed declaration that they must be fitted for citizenship. Imme diate legislation on the matter of pres idential succession is urged in conclu sion. The message is generally well re ceived. The Tribune says, "It is a creditable paper," and the Boston Journal, that at least it is not a weak one. It is specially commended for its freedom from partizanship and its cant dor. 

PROHIBITION WINS IN GEORGIA. Mention of the news from Georgia was crowded out of these columns last week, but it was good enough to keep. The color line and all other lines were obliterated in the temperance contest in Atlanta. ' Of the 136 1 counties in Georgia over 120 have taken advan tage of the local option law, and have declared in favor of prohibition. Aud now to Atlanta is accorded the honor of being iia first large city of the state, and of the South, to make the experi ment. The contest between the "wet" and "dry" men as they are called is not over yet, and every obstruction possible seems likely to be put. in the way of the execution of the law, but the action ot the state is encouraging and the outlook hopeful. .Possibly we or New Hngland may learn a lessou from our Southern broth ers. Under the present local optiou law in Georgia these elections are for bidden in any month in which general elections are held. 1 litis the rum question is made a distinct issue and separated from all local or national questions that, with us, so often defeat the wishes of the temperance voters. HOW TO 

DISCONTINUE A PAPER, Occasionally people are heard to remark that they can never get their paper discontinued. There is one very easy way to stop a paper, name ly : Pay all dues there may be and then order it discontinued. But be suro and pay arrearages before order ing a paper stopped. About this sea- sou of the year a good mauy thought less or mean people allow their news paper to run from three weeks to two months over the time and then order it stopped without paying up. A lit tie thought on the part of any oue will show how unjust 6uch a course is. It only takes twelve such persons who have allowed their paper to over run a month eacli to irfake a year's subscrip tion lost at the publication office. A case in point: The postmaster at East Burke writes this office Dee. 5, that The Caledonian goiug to a certaiu sub scriber there is "not wanted." By re ferring to the margin of the paper he could easily have seen that there were five weeks due on that subscription, and a post-master should know, if the subscriber does not, that the decisions of courts, as well as equity, require all arrearages paid before a publisher is obliged to stop a newspaper. After a newspaper is paid for to date and ordered stopped, theu if another uumber is received, the subscriber's duty is not to take it from the office, but to request tho postmaster to re turu it to the office of publication. The method is very easy and very simple. It requires no writing of letters or ex pense of postage stamps. If the pub lic will remember these directions they will find it extremely easy to stop auy paper. But first pay for it. I here is no more reason for a publisher to give 13 months newspaper for a year than there is for a farmer to give five perks for a bushel, or a merchant 20 ounces for a pound. NOTE AND COMMENT. Providence, R. I., refuses to renew licenses heretofore granted skating rink licensees. It is calculated that the total pay ments for pensions will by 1890 amount to over $1,000,000,000. The number of guests in the Windsor hotel at Montreal fell off 15,000 in six mouths as a result of the small-pox ep idemic. The public debt increased more than $4,000,000 during the month of No vember, despite the fact that the dem ocrats have charge of the purse strings Another straw. The Pittsburg iron dealers report an advance of $1 on pig metal and 50 cents on ore, a substan tial evidence of a revival in the iron trade. The first volume of Gen. Grant's book was issued last week. Orders for 325,000 copies have already beeu re ceived and it is thought that the sale will reach 500,000. The Christian Union thinks the peo pie of this country have washed their dirty linen iu their front yards long enough, and urges that the court-room doors be closed on divorce suits. The Germans have annexed the Mar shall islands, whereat the American Board is considerably surprised. For over 30 years the history of these is lands has been closely identified with mission work. O. G. Barron, the well-known pro prietor of the Crawford, Fabyan's, Twin Mountain and other hotels has taken a five years' lease of the New Putnam House, at Palatka, Florida, which will be opened on Jan. 15. When the Indian government an nexes Burmah, which seems likely to be the next thiug on the program, the British Empire will gain 195,000 miles of territory, an area nearly as large as Frauce, and about 4,000,000 people. When a mad dog rushes through the streets biting six children, as was the case in Newark, N. J., last week, it is about time to inquire if human life is not of more worth than dogs. If it is, dogs should he exterminated. The New York World has been inti mating pretty . strongly that Mayor Grace of New York ought to be keep ing company with Ward in Sing Sing. Mr. Grace thinks it has injured him $50,000 worth, and has sued the World for that amount. It is said that President Cleveland will look more carefully into the Ver mont appointments hereafter. This is locking up the barn after the horse is stolen. The boss announced a fort night ago that the fourth class postoffi ce8 were "filled." Evangelist Moody's ' meetings - were largely attended in St. Albans, begin ning Saturday evening and closing Sunday evening. He lacked nothing in his power as a preacher and in bis ability to impress his hearers with the truth. It isn't every county that can trust its convicts "with the legal, documents and send them off alone to the house of correction as was done by the coun ty conrt Tuesday in the case of Ruiter. Even the criminals seem to feel the St. Johnsbury influence. A lot of third and fourth class post masters met iu Illinois last week and decided to held a convention February 15 to consider grievances. They want more pay. It doesn't seem to occur to them that they can resign. But then, office-holders never resign. . Three times during the past fortnight the Rutland Herald has been obliged to issue double sheets to accommodate advertisers. The Herald richly de serves all the success it is getting. ' It has been advanciug steadily since the new management assumed control the first of the year. l lie Uoston and ioweii announces that the through service to Moutreal via the Central Vermont and "Air Line" has been resumed. It is said that Montreal was never in as good sanitary condition as now, and Collec tor Smalley thinks the small-pox will be stamped out by Jan. 1. - Here's a chance for a trade. King Kalakana offers to eell the Sandwich Islands. The king's price is $14,500, 000 and a plantation of 8000 acres of land in Southern California. The Phil adelphia Press says the property con sists of two sugar houses, one extinct volcano and 700 cases of leprosy, all in middling repair. It is estimated that more than 5,000, 000 pounds of imitation butter were made last year by three concerns. How much more was made nobody knows and, worse yet, nobody knows who has eaten the stuff. Vermont butter mak ers find some consolation, however, in the fact that Judge Simonton of Penn sylvania handed down an opinion last Friday declaring constitutional the law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine. Business Booming at Moutpeller. During the six days ending Satur day, November 28, no less than twelve whist parties had been held in Mont pelier society. Watchman. Too Greedy. A dispatch says that Vermont dem ocrats are pestering the administration for office. We thought that every one of the score or so of democrats in that state already had an office apiece. Do they want two or three each f Are they after the earth? Boston Jour nal. Just About the Size of It. The president has debarred Chair man Brown us au office broker for the state of Maine. But' wherein is it worse for a committee-man to peddle offices tor cash than for a congressman to dispose of them for votes to keep him in power T J he spoils system can not be destroyed by clipping away at the suckers and runners, lue axe must be laid at the root of the tree. Boston Record. A Sad Case. Simon Brown, chairmau of the Maine democratic committee, is accused o making the men who get office by his help divide with him. This is sad enough. Expressed in rhyme, this seems to be the melancholy truth : Simple Simon met a spoilsman Going tor his ware ; Said Simple Simon to the spoilsman : "You aud 1 must share ! Boston Record. 

NEWS OF THE WEEK. Ieath or Vanderbllt. William II. Vanderbilt died suddenly at his home on Fifth avenue in New York Tuesday at 2.20 p. m., from pa ralysis of the brain. He was convers ing with Robert Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, in his favorite study, where he transacted all his business, when he suddenly pitch ed forward from his arm-chair to the floor, and died in a few minutes. Mr. Vanderbilt left a will: but its provis ions are unknown to any one except the family and his confidential counsel, Mr. Depew. Mr. Depew thinks that the millionaire's death would make no change in existiug conditions. The Vanderbilt railroad systems will be managed aud owned as heretofore. The sons will manage the estate and the properties. No commotion in financial circles seems likely to result. Mr, Vanderbilt had long ago abandoned the street and the stock market. The British Elections. The latest returns from the British parliamentary elections show that 324 liberals, 24b conservatives aud 7o Par nellites have been chosen to the House of Commons. An earthquake iu Morocco, Friday, threw down mauy houses at Mascara, Bildah and Medeah and destroyed three-quarters of the town of Msila Thirty-two persons were killed and twelve injured.

Terrific natural-gas explosions at Pittsburg. Pa., Friday, did great dam age to three buildings, fatally injured one woman and seriously hurt three others. The woman who was killed started for the cellar for coal 'with a lighted lamp.

At the animal meeting of the How ard Relief society, on the 2d, Hon Heuiy Ballard appeared, and in behalf ot Miss Louise Howard presented the society a deed of one third of Exchange block, ou Church street. The proper ty is worth teu thousand dollars and rents for about seven hundred dollars. This noble gift places upon a new ba sis one ot the most worthy charitable institutions of the city and will extend its usefuluess' far beyond the fondest hopes of its members.
