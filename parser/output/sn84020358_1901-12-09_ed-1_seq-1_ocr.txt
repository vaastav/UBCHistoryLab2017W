THE CARMNGTON PUBLISHING C 1 1 A r TO RATIFY CANAL TREATY FAVORABLE ACTION WITH LITTLE DELAY IS EXPECTED. Senate Will Go Into Executive Session To-day to Consider the Convention and Will Do So Each Day Until It Is niipoitd Or Very Little Opposition Anticipated. Washington, Dec. 8. The only meas ure of Importance which the senate has on Its calendar for the present week la the new Hay-Pauncefote treaty, mak ing provision for the abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and opening the way for the unobstructed construction of an isthmian canal by the United States. Acting for the committee on foreign relations Senatov Lodge will ask the senate to go. into executive session to-morrow for the consideration of the treaty and in each day thereafter until the convention la disposed of. It can be said that at this time the prospect is very strong that the treaty will be ratfled and it now looks as if this result would be secured after com paratively little delay. There will be some debate and some features of the document will be classed as undesirable but there is no probability of captious opposition, The criticism will be along tho lines indicated by Senators Money and Bacon in the committee on foreign relations at its meeting on Friday last. No senator thus far, however, has ehown a disposition to carry his objec tions to the point of ultimate effort to defeat ratification. The principal au thors of the criticism of the treaty are southern senators, who are generally very anxious for the construction of the canal. They find that all canal legisla tion will Be tied up until action can be secured on the treaty, and they are on this account less liable than they would be to do anything to delay action upon the treaty itself. The most active . friends of the treaty now claim that ratification will be secured during the present week, and. the opinion is very peneral that ratification will be obtain ed before the Christmas holidays. Beyond the consideration of the treaty, very little business will be un dertaken before the holidays. It is now generally agreed that the question of reciprocity will go over until Janu ary, and it may be added that, from being for a time the subject most likely tt) attract earlier attention it has taken a position among the matters which nyill not be vigorously urged. When the reciprocity treaties do come up for con sideration, there will be persistent op . position to the agreement with France and to that with Great Britain ooyer - -log .the West Indies. There is not so v much feeling over the conventions with "tho South American republics. The present outlook also is against any im mediate action in the senate looking to tariff legislation for the Philippines, and there are some indications that the senate will wait upon the house in this : matter. Probably the Chinese exclusion act will be reported from committee during the week. The nomination of Attorney General Knox will be reported at the first exec utive session, but immediate confirma tion probably will be antagonized by some senators. ' 

CHICAGO PRO-BOER MEETING. WORK OF THE HOUSE. Passage of Measure to Meet Philippine Tariff Deetalon Likely. Washington, Dec. 8.--The house this week probably will pass a measure to meet the situation created by the Phil ippines decision of the supreme court Jajjt Monday regarding the tariff. Up to the present time, however, the republi can members of the ways and means committee have not decided upon the character of the measure which will be reported. A difference of opinion exists as to whether there should be a tem porary enactment of the Dingley rates on goods entering the United States from the Philippines, or whether a per manent scheme of tariff legislation for the islands should be prepared. It is understood that Mr. Payne, chairman of the committee, and Mr. Dalzell, of Pennsylvania, favor the latter course. The republican members of the com mittee will meet again to-morrow. Of course, if it is decided to enact on the, temporary measure the procedure will be exceedingly simple and it probably can be passed in a day. If, on the other hand, an etire scheme of tariff legislation is to be enacted, more time twIU be consumed both in the prepara tion and passage of the measure. Cautinlttce Appointed to See the Presl-dent-Iionrke CocUran penke. Chicago, Dec. 8. A programme of protest against British methods in the South African war was carried out be fore an immense audience in the Audi torium theater here to-night. The meeting was held under the auspices of the Chicago branch of the American Transvaal league. Following an elo quent address by W. Bourke Cockran and earnest speeches by others resolu tions for the appointment of a commit tee to bring the seniiments of the meet ing before the president were adopted. Although an admission was charged, the funds being intended to aid the Boers, and especially their women and children, standing room was at a pre mium and many were unable to gain admittance. Mr. Cockran, the orator of the even ing, was greeted with a tumult of ap plause. In the course of his remarks he said that England must soon give up the struggle. He then said: "This state ment is not based on any special infor mation concerning the war, but on the conviction that it will be impossible for the government to secure the passage of many more war appropriations through the House of Commons. The last budget was passed only after im mense difficulties. AJ1 sources of taxa tion have practically been exhausted, and the attempt to effect another large war loan would result in such a fall in the price of consols as would seriously i jeopardize British industries. If, theft, the Boer forces can hold the field a lit tle longer the attempt to subdue the re publics must be abandoned for lack of means to pursue it. "The pretense that the existence of these republics endangered British au thority over the rest of South Africa is unworthy of serious consideration. If republics and monarchlal authority are so hostile that their mere proximity in volves conflict between them, this coun try would be Justified in annexing Can ada as a necessary measure of protec tion for its own safety. "This meeting has no disposition to provoke bitterness or to Increase the crop of resentments, already too large, throughout the world. Much as we might desire the incorporation of Can ada in the Union, unless tt could be ac complished by the consent of the peo ple on both sides of the frontier, we do not wish it, .but it may be well to point out that there was much less justifiable ground for the assault upon the South African republics by Great Britain than there would have been for the for cible annexation of Canada by this country." A speech by Bishop Spauldlng, of Pe oria, roused the audience to a high pitch of enthusiasm. The meeting closed with a remarkable demonstration. Following the speech making the great audience reared its approval of the Boer cause, the cheer ing being long continued, and then con tributions were asked for the relief of the stricken women and children in the South African camps. The first re sponse was a check for $500 sent up by a man who requested that his name be withheld. Then followed checks for $100, the contributors of this amount be ing numerous .When smaller sums were asked for money came freely from all parts of the great Auditorium. More than $5,000 was raised. . 1 NEW AND 

WONDERFUL CAVE JUST DISCOVER ED FIFTY MILES EAST OF BUTTE, MOST. Kxploratlon Party Goes Over an Area of Ten Miles and to a Depth of 1,000 Feet A Large River With a Cataract of About 100 Feet Explored a Distance of Several Miles. Denver, Deo. 8. A special from Butte says a new and wonderful naturafcave, believed to be one of the largest known, has just been discovered in the canon of the Jefferson, on the line of the Northern Pacific railroad, about fifty miles east of Butte. An exploration party from that city spent Beveral days in the cave, going over an area of ten miles and to a depth of nearly one thousand feet. A large river, with a cataract of about one hundred feet, was : explored a distance of several mile9 without its source or outlet being dis covered. A few articles of stone and copper utensile and some bones, believ ed to be human, were also found in one of the large apartments of the oave. There were other evidences that In some pre-historic period the cave was inhabited. The formation of stalactites and other natural decorations through out the cave are most beautiful. AMERICAN DESERTER KILLED. MAJOR F. A. SPENCER DEAD. t London Times Comment. ' London, Dec. 9. The Times, in an ed itorial on the Hay-Pauncefote canal treaty, says it is hard to see how Great Britain could concede more without pre tending to give Wh4t she did not pos sess, namely, the rights and incidents of territorial sovereignty. "That fact, however," says the Times, "would not weaken the objections of those senators anxious to oppose anything making for Rood relations with Great Britain. As President Roosevelt and public opinion both seem to favor this treaty, we ven ture to hope that it will surmount the threatened obstruction." To Prosecute Conor tl'Kelly, M. P. London, Dec. 8. The government has decided to prosecute Conor O'Kelly, M. P., and chairman of the Mayo county council, and several officials of the county Mayo, under the crimes act, for holding meetings and delivering Intimi dating speeches in defiance of the or ders of the police.

Native scouts from Bongabon, province of Neuva Ecija: have killed the American negro, David Fagin, a deserter froni ? the Twenty fourth (colored) infantry, who for more than two years has been leading Fill plnos against the American troops. The native scouts decapitated their pris oner. The man's head, however, was recognized as that of JT&Sin's. They also secured his commission in the in- surgent army. Fagin had on one of his fingers the class ring of Lieutenant Frederick W. Altstaetter, of the engin eers, who was captured by Filipinos supposedly under the command of Fa gln himself, October 2.8, 1900. Fagin has been reported killed upon several occasions. The authorities are satisfied that former statements of his death were erroneous and that he has now been killed. :; . . .. A military commission has sentenced the Filipino General Isldoro Torres to be hanged, after finding him guilty of ordering the assassination of Corporal Fieldner of the Twelfth infantry, at Malolos, province of Bulacan, last Oc tober. The sentence of the commission has been disapproved by General Chaff fee, who finds that the commission had reasonable grounds tp; doubt whether General Torres personally ordered the assassination of the American soldier. General Chaffee thinks that the high rank held by Torres In the insurgent army would have been sufficient to pre vent such unmilitary , action on his part. " . . . '

St. Petersburg students have begun the issue of an underground news paper. It is stated in the first issue that meetings are planned at Kharkoff and that the students would continue to protest unless women and Jews were admitted unrestrictedly to all educa tional institutions, unless the local re strictions were removed and unless the former students were all re-admitted.

The arrests were made by Agent William P. Flynn of the secret service bureau and assistants. It is asserted that the men were engaged in making and passing counterfeit quarters, and in the basement of Weitzman' house was found a complete outfit for making these counterfeits as well as unfinished dies for ten-cent pieces and a quantity of bogus quarters. Rosengarden is said by the officers to have done the en graving and to have been the head of a gang of counterfeiters which operated in Philadelphia about six years ago. He was convicted and sentenced, so the secret men soy, to a term of five years in the Cherry Hill prison. None of the other prisoners, so far as known, have any previous record as counterfeiters.

Herbert Marx, who on Tuesday night last shot and killed William Taylor and William Hef- flln and seriously wounded James Stiff, at. his father's plantation house near Oak Grove, Va., reached his home in Brooklyn this evening. He . left Oak Grove Immediately after his exonera tion by the coroner's jury and reached Washington on Thursday. As to his whereabouts since Thursday nothing was obtainable. Abel L. Blackmar of Brooklyn, of the law firm of Baldwin & Blackmar, Manhattan, gave out a statement to-night of the affair, giving the details of the shooting of the men who came to lynch him for his suppose ed insult to a young woman. Marx deeply deplores the publicity given the young lady In the case, and who has since stated that he had never offered her an insult. Since the shooting the young man had spent most of his time in Washington, where he put his case in the hands of Representative Jones of his home district. the year fol- the small denominations of money feauired In retail trade. Coinage operations were conducted during the year in the mints at Phila delphia, San Francisco and New Or leans. The Philadelphia mint is now in its new quarters and the old site, in cluding the structure, will be offered for gale to the highest bidder on December 19, 1901. An upset price of $2,000,000 has been placed Upon It. The original cost of the ground to the government was $35,840. The cost of the new site and structure has been $2,000,000, and the appropriation for equipment $440,000, but a considerable portkih of the latter is yet unexpended. The new mint under construction at Denver has nlade slow progress during the year and the supervising architect finds an additional appropriation neces sary before the final contract can be let. The appropriation for site and building was $500,000 and for equipment $150,000. The new mints' at Philadelphia and Denver, the ground with the old ones at San Francisco and New Orleans will af ford 'ample facilities' for this country for many years to come. ' The original deposits of gold at the mints and assay offices amounted to $153,101,580, an increase of $19,181,561 over the preceding year. Of this $27, 906,489 was in foreign coin, $17,600,463 that of Great Britain, nearly all being from Australia, and $5,426,500 that of Japan. The estimated production of gold in the United States during the calendar year 1900 was of the value of $79,171,000, and, notwithstanding the fact that this country led the world In production Its Imports exceeded its exports by $12,866, 010. . The production of North Ameri ca practically all of which comes to the United States, was $116,051,500. The world's coinage of gold during the calendar year 1900 was $354,938,497, and ofsllver $177,011,902. The Industrial consumption of gold in the United States during the calen dar year 1900 is estimated at $16,667,500 and of the world approximately $75,000,- 000. ' The stock of subsidiary coin In the country Is limited by law to $100,000,000 and on November 1, 1901, the existing stock was $90,613,512. The report says It is not improbable that before another congress shall have opportunity to act the growing needs of the country will have absorbed the entire amount authorized. By the act of March 14, 1900, authority was given to use silver bullion purchas ed under the act of July 14, 1890, for this coinage, but -it is necessary that the limit set upon the stock in the country be removed or raised. On November 1, 1901, the stock of bullion acquired un der the act of July 14, 1890, was 51,763, 642 standard ounces. If enough of this were coined into dollar pieces to take up the treasury notes issued for Its cost there would remain 15,539,892 standard ounces, which converted into subsidiary coin would give $19,321,113. It is suggested that the limit of the country's stock of subsidiary coin bet raised to at least $120,000,000. No good reason is apparent, says tne report, why the coinage of dollar pieces should not be allowed to cease and all of the silver on hand be used in subsidiary coinage. cause him to dismount he will be al lowed to continue his score without suf fering loss of distance when he secures a new wheel. The Swedish team, Furtos and Peter son, failed to qualify and withdrew from the race. TRIBUTE TO AMERICAN WOMEN. Mai from O'Rell'i Opinion as Drawn the Horse Show. Paris, Dec. 8. Max Offlell writing in the Figaro this morning about Ameri can women describes fhem at the New York Horse ehow, which he says was the most brilliant spectacle of fashion able elegance he had ever seen. The scene at Madison Square Garden was more French than English, says the writer, Only, the elite of society was present. In this respect the New York is unlike the London horse show, where cheap admissions' cause "violent social contrasts. While mostly of Eng lish origin, American women resemble the women of Pariri more than their English sisters", not baaeusr they wear the latest Paris fashions the English upper class do the eame but never lose the stamp of their : country. It Is the the frank look in their Intelligent faces, the vivacity of their movements, the absence of affection and stiffness, the simpleness and. grace of their carriage and their assured bearing, which char acterize American women, that makes them resemble Parisian women. INTERESTING LABOR BILL. The Industrial Arbitration Measure of New South Wales. Sydney, N. S. W., Dec. 8. By the passage of the industrial arbitration bill through its final stage, the govern ment has placed upon the statute books a measure, the working of which will excite interest throughout the whole world. This bill not only compels reference of all disputes between employers and employes to a competent court with power to enforce its orders and awards, but makes a strike or a lockout, before or pending such reference, a misde meanor punishable by a fine or impris onment. The court which will pass up on these disputes is to be presided over by a judge of the supreme court and will have most extensive powers,-Including the power to declare a standard wage and to direct that, other things being equal, an employer shall give preference to unionist over non-unionist laborers. There is no appeal from the decisions of this court. Progress In the Methods-Wire... . - Telegraphy Now in Use. M Washington,' Dec. 8. The annual T port of Professor Willis L.
