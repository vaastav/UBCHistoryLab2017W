DESTINED TO BECOME GREATER FROCIS M'CORD ADDRESSES TUG COMMERCIAL CLUB. TfeiTly Organized Club of Fort Scott, Kai, Send Greetings Over the Recently Completed Long I""lnnre Telephone Conaectio-. Francis McCord, of tho Smlth-McCord Dry Goods Company, gave the Commer cial Club, last night, some interesting tacts regarding Kansas City's greatness as a jobbing center. "Practically. Kansas City Is the geo graphical center of the United States," said Mr. McCord. "Having this as a foun dation upon which to rest, do jou wonder that she has made such rapid strides in the jobbing world? Located as she Is in the -very heart of the territory which is destined to supply the world with bread and meat for many j ears to come, she may and does very consistently expect a largo and ever-Increasing volume of business. "It is estimated that at present there are nearly 3.000.009 people within a radius of Va miles of Kansas City, and this estl ' mate, is for what might be termed our nearby or immediate trade. Taking these. In conjunction withthe people of the far ther South and West, who are dependent upon Kansas City for tho necessities and luxuries of life. Is the phenomenal increase In her various Jobbing interests so very remarkable? I think not. "In looking over a history of Kansas City. I find that in 1S67 the city council ap pointed a special committee to compile a statement of the trade and progress of the city for the sear of 1SG6. This statement shows that her population at that time was 15.06t; that the jobbing business for the same jear amounted to $S,74S.633. and the entire business wholesale and retail. Including manufactures, amounted to but i.73t.SS0. Thirty years after these Jig . ures were compiled, the amount of capital Invested in the jobbing business alone is found to be In excess of the entire business transactions during the year of 1SG5. There lB a ,wll0,e. h'story in this statement, and should I give nothing more than the few facts presented, my theme of Kansas City as a jobbing center would be complete. - Kian?sJCJ.ty's..central 'ocatlon was ap preciated during the war; and being a bate or operation, there was a tendency to de crease her population and stagnate com merce. "It is difficult to realize that during the period of which I speak, Leavenworth was a formidable rival in the jobbing trade," and St. Joseph was so rirmly established com mercially that Kansas City was regarded as not being in the ua class. How dif, lerrnt are the conditions to-d.v-j wlth;K-ui-baCity having a population more than double that of the larger or the tw o above mentioned cities, not including her recent ly acquired Increase. What Mokfi Kansas City Great? "The building of railroads Into Kansas City probably marks the period when sh'o began to lay claim to ;the title of being a jobbing center; but it was not until theJ J ear 1S77 that tho cities of Chicago and St. Louis recognized her as a competitor in tho mercantile world. "In the course of conversation the other day. this question was put: 'What is there about Kansas City to make her great?' The reply was most unique: 'She has half of the United States on the other side of her without competition." Has it ever oc curred to you how many people there are between her and the foothills of the Rock ies who come to her for supplies? Does not this convey an Idea of her greatness? "Her steps toward becoming a metropo lis have been rapid and sure. It was a common sight, a few years ago. to see a train of prairie schooners trav cling AVcst ward, but they aro relegated to tho past, and Kansas City stands to-day without an equal in the world, with her nineteen 6 stems and thirty-three lines of railroads. "Taking into consideration tho foregoing facts, is she not in thn pink of condition to care for tho wants of tho Western mer chantnot to speak of her ability to reach liim rrom fifteen to thirty hours ahead or St. Louis or Chicago? "But tho saving or time Is not the only benefit derived by using Kansas Cltv as a market. To tho progressive and enterpris ing man (and ho must osscss these quali ties to be a successful merchant), thcre,aro other points of view. Quality and price aro primo factors, as aro character and magnitude of tho stocks carried by the jobler; jet Kansas City seems to hive f-olved this part of tho problem as easilv i-s she has the others, as the increased j Influx of buyers this year ov cr former j ears would indicate. "Tho matter of freight rates necessarily comes Into play. I cannot better express msclf on this point than to quote our lormer freight commlssloncr.Mr. A. J. Van lamllngham. now of St. Louis (and, inci dentally. St. Louis knew whero to come to pick her timber), who made tho following statement in a small pamphlet written a J ear or two ngo: 'The excellence of our transportation facilities, tho large number of railroads centering here, together with the freight rates out .-us compared with Jobbing points elsewhere, our ability to protect ourselves agiinst di'crimin itivo rates make It partlcularlv valuable as a jobbing center.

Implement Trade Lends the World. "About twenty-live J ears ago. a gentle man (and, by the way, an cx-prcsldent of tills club) came to Kansas City to take tho position of traveling salesman for an implement houc. At the time of his com ing ho made the prophecy that Kansas CItj would one day lead the world in the implement trade. How true this prophecv Is jou all know and he is not jet an old , lrnn.

THIEVES ARE KNOWN. Pictures of the Mailbox Robber Identified by Bankers and Ar rest Seem Certain. The Identity of the mailbox thieves who cashed one check at a Kansas City, Kas., lank Monday and came within an ace ot cashing another at tho First National bank in this city, as told exclusively in The Journal j-esterday, aro known to the offi cers, and their arrest, sooner or later, is certain. "Thej- are criminals who have en gaged In similar ventures before, and their pictures aro in several rogues' galleries. These pictures were shown jesterday to at least one teller who had a good look at the men, and were positively identitied as those of tho two men who came Into the bank with the stolen check. Inquiry at the banks In this city jester daj tailed to bring out any turther at tempts on the part of the gang of mailbox thieves to cash stolen checks. It is be lieved that a number of checks were se cured hj. th.. thieve, but their failuie io take In the First National bank probably lrlghtened them rrom trjing to work other banking houses. Monday evening while the cltj- officials and the Pinkertons were scouring the city for the thieves some one broke open one of the boxes on St. Louis avenue, near Mul berry, and carried off whatever was in the box. The box was all right at 5 o'clock when the day carrier made his collection, but It bad been robbed and the lock car ried awaj when the night carrier reached it a few minutes prior to " o'clock in the evening. It is located at a corner where tl cro is considerable Import.int and val uable mall dropped each evening. The us ual evening collection jields from ten to lirtj letters each daj Whatever number was there had been carried off. The steal ing of tho lock Is a serious affair, as it gives the gang plentj- ot chances Tor man ufacturing kejs for their business. Three government detectives arrived In Kansas Citj' j-esterday afternoon, assigned to tollow up the mail box thieves who began operations in this city and in Kan sas Citj-, K.is.. Mondaj". They immediately consulted with the Pinkerton detectives and the city detectives and began a thor ough search or tho city. .Every train out or the depots In the two cities was watched yesterdaj-. The officers are positive that four men have leen operating in this citj' who belong to the same gang. One of the men idcntilied served a term In New York for;mall box robbing. He was captured with a mail carrier's suit on, and it is the opinion ot the officers that he has been opening boxes In this city disguised In the same manner. SPUR TOJAIRMOUNT. Route Decided On and Contractu Will at Once He Let for tbe Elec tric Itond. The Metropolitan Street Railway Com panj lias decided on a route for its new bpur from the Independence Klectric line to Fairmount park. The branch will leave the main lino a short distance east of Washington park and will run In an al most direct lino to the new park. The burvej- shows the line will be 4.600 feet long. Tho spur will bo a double track, and run under the Alton railroad tracks and over the Missouri Pacific tracks, thus, avoiding the dangers of a crossing on tho level. Tho line will be constructed In about three months. Tho contracts will be let hhortlj- and work will be begun Immcdi atelj' in order to hav o the branch ready for oieration bj' the time the park season opens. .The roadbed will be rock ballasted and every modern impiovement will be used to make the branch equal to the present main line. A termln il depot will bo built at Fair mount park that will le a great Improve ment on the sj-stems that hive been in vogue in the past. There will be a gate sjs tem so that tho crowds can bo regulated and avoid confusion and accidents, i he cars will be marked so that no one will mako a mistake and take the wrong car for Independence or Kansas Citj-. Vice President Holmes, of the Metropoli tan companj'. said jestcraaj- that a three minute service would be established on the line during the park season. IT WAS A 

LIVE WIRE. Pin IrvTln Receive n Terrible .shock: on the Grand Stage and Was In- conxctou Twenty Mlnutca. As Miss Flo Irwin, the star of the "Wid ow Jones" companj", tripped on the stage of the Grand last evening in the middle of the third act, her foot caught 'an elec tric light wlro that had carelessly been left exposed across the floor from her dressing room to the stage. She was so shocked by the current that she fainted as she reached the stage. The curtain was rung down and the performance closed abruptly. Manager Andrews was thoroughly frightened when Miss Irwin was carried to her room and he hastilv railed Dr. Brown lee. It required twentv minutes' persistent attention to restore the "widow" to con sciousness and it was an hour later be fore she was able to be taken to the Mid land. It was at first thought she was se riously hurt, but bj midnight she had al most recovered from the shock. The plot of the nlav takes MIs Irwin off the stage in the middle of the third act but requires her to come hack almost im-nudlatelj-. She missed the wires as she went off the stage, but coming on kicked II up with one toe and was knocked to her knees bv the force of the shock.

TRIES TO IJIPROVE IJPOX PRESIDET'S MESSAGE. THE SENDS A MESSAGE OF HIS OWN TELLS WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAID REGARDING CUBA. A Deposed Cleveland Underling Takes It Upon Iltmaelf to Administer a Severe Rebuke In Behalf , of the American People. Mobile, Ala., Dec 7. Ex-MInister to Spain Hannis Taj lor gives out the fol lowing: "The Associated Press has requested me to express mj- views as to that part of the president's message which relates to the Cuban question. Putting aside the irrele v ant matter bj- which it is incumbered, the substance of the only recommendation made bj- the executive to congress upon that subject Is that this government can not venture to do anj thing to put an end to the Inhuman strife which, during the last three jears, has reduced the inland almost to a desert, because there is a pros pect of a settlement between the combat ants upon the basis of a so-called plan of autonomy latelj- put forth bj- the Sagasla mlnistrj-. I believe congress should firmlj and scornfully reject such a policy of ir resolution and non-action, because the as sumption upon which it is founded is an empty illusion. "The v ital question at issue has not been touched bj- the revolutionary effort of Sa gasta to end the war by mems of a crart ilj' incomplete proposition that carries witn it no constitutional guarantee whatever. All who are familiar with Spanish legisla tion know that a valid grant of an auton omous colonial sjstem that Involves not only the repeal of all existing laws, upon that subject, but also the transfer of the control of a large part of the national revenues of Spain to a colonial legislature cannot be made except bj- an act passed bj- both houses of the cortes and approved by tho queen regent. The effort just made to secure that result bj- a mere rojal de cree, unsupported bj- parliamentary ac tion, has, thererorc, been justlj- denied by Romero Robledo, late minister of jus tice, as a purelj- rev olutlonarj- proceeding in defiance of the legislation. "Sagasta has resorted to the unconstitu tional attempt to legislate bj- rojal de cree. Knowing the nation is against him, he docs not dare to state his proposals Jclearlj- upon the matter In question, and It is certain that if he should assert even his incomplete scheme to the present cortes, it would be cither rejected entlrelj- or so amended as to deprive it of all vitality. "In one particular, the cabinets at Wash ington and Madrid aro In Identically the some situation. Both are striving with all .!u!r m!eM elthc. it Cefj or circumvent the national will as embodied In their re spective legislatures. "At the end ot three jears of wholesale destruction, provoked by Spain, through unprecedented political and economic op pression that has brought death and famine to hundreds of thousands, tho Spanish crown at last confesses the Cubans are right and their wrongs bhould now be re dressed by a generous and genuine gTant of home rule. When the proffered scheme is examined, it is found to be not only in definite and illegal, but absolutely wanting in sincerity upon tho two vital points at issuance. Such proposal has been extorted by the results of a struggle that has so completely broken the military and finan cial power of Spain that a conquest of the Island is now hopeless. "After expending three hundred millions of dollars, and after sending over the sea 

SOO.OOO soldiers, Spain has a fighting force In the island or less than 6eventj- thousand, while the rev olutlonarj- armj-. now in pos session ot the greater part or the country, numbers about fifty thousand. "Who has the right to say that the he roic men who have maintained In the menlguas of Cuba such a conflict against such odds are not capable of selfgov em inent? Who will say that ail the fruits that they have won through 'death by sword and famine should, in the hour of v Ictoiy. be surrendered for an empty sham, w hich means onlj- new bondage under their old and pitiless oppressors? "And jet this heartless, selfish message has not one word of encouragement or sjmpathj' for this suffering people, now dj lng and starving by thousands at our erj doors. In it thej- aro contemptuously de nominated as no better than their perse cutors. Fortunately for the honor of this generous Christian nation, this mess ige, with cool and serene cynicism, admits that It does not represent the sentiments of tho American people as expressed bj- congress a j ear ago in the joint resolution, in which both houses declared a state or war did exist in Cuba, and that it should be rec ognized by this government. Congress is loiitcly told to nttend to its own business; that if tho recognition of belligerency bhall become necessary in the future, the exec utive power will act without congressional interference. "It is generally understood that this de liberate conspiracy to thwart the will of the nation Is to be carried out through an appeal to the speaker or the home ir rep resentatives, who is expected to so ma nipulate its rules as to prevent the piss age or tho pending belligcrencj i evolution, which the senat has already approved In other words, the tjranny of tho speaker ship in the house Is to bo so used in behalf of Spanish tjranny In Cuba .is to prevent any expression whatever of sjmpatnv with oi ieeognition of the Cuban government "The house of representatives is cither to be muzzled or called upon to deelaie that this revolutionary government, which has virtuallv crushed the power of Spain in Cub-v has no such do facto existence as will atithorizo a recognition of war between the contending parties. The absurd eon tention becomes the more grotesque when wo remember that Spam has expended, without effect, against such revolutionarj government, far more money than Great Britain emplojed during our entire Revolutionarj- war. "There are limits, even to the patience of the American people; and the time has now come when the executive power should be made to teel. through public demonstFa tion, that the nation will no longer permit its sovereign will in a righteous cause to be entirely set aside in the interest or a trem ulous, selfish, short sighted pollcj-. The whole contest now centers in the passage of tho belligerency resolution, pending in the house. It that cannot be carried, tnen nothing whatever can be done to end a strlte that lias been going on for fifteen j-ears out of the last twentj--nlne, and which, after destroying our commerce with the island, has become a war cloud that to-daj- obscures everj- business enterprise If the present administration proposes, to lndefinitelj postpone such uncertainty at the cost ot eveiy business interest. It must be prepared to accept the consequences. "At this last stage of the struggle, there can hardlj- be a doubt that If belligerency should be recognized within three months the insurgents would be so dominant In the Island that the war could shortly be ended bv- the recognition of Cuban independence. Those who are lest Informed flrmlv believe that without one word or aid or sjmpithj from us. that result will be attained within twelve or eighteen months. If bungling- di- plomacj- shall permit such an event, the situation maj- assume a serious rorm that rew seem to contemplate. If we scorn and spit upon the Cubans until victorj- and in dependence are won without aid or com fort from us, why should thej- not turn to one or the other of the great maritime pow ers that will then be only too eager to sup ply all their wants and to enter Into the closest relations with them? . "We have for a long time declared no P.uropean power other than Spain shall ever possess Cuba. We may so blunder as to be forced to maintain that contention at tho point ot the sword. Out' ot such pcssible difficulties, the waj- is now clear and easj-. Let tho pending belligerency resolution be promptly passed b the house, ai.d Spain's power in Cuba will collapse like a punctured balloon. For that reason she is making a desperate fight against It, with the aid of the present administra tion. "Only through the triumph of the revolu tionary government can permanent and lasting peace be established In Cuba; only through a prompt and decided expression ot sjmpathj- with that government can we extricate ourselves rrom a dilemma which Is rast growing into the most shortsighted and disgracetul episode in our national his-torj-.'' , 

WITH HIS MOTHER AGAIN. President McKlnley Reaches Canton In Time for a Lout Recogni tion and Greeting. Canton: O., Dec. 7. Once more the chil dien of Nancy Allison McKinley havo gath eied about her couch, and the reunion is complete. The, president and Mrs. McKin-lej- arrived to-day to find the aged mother still living. With the children are Mrs. Abigail Osborne, mother of Consul William Osborne; Miss Sarah Duncan, who came frcm Chicago, where she is attending school; her brother. Jack Duncan, who came from an Eastern school, and the other grandchildren, who have been sum moned from their studies and their homes, together with other relatives, making the immediate familj- circle almost complete. In the midst of the deep sorrow of the family, there Is a feeling of joy that the president has been permitted to reach his riother's bedside before the inevitable dis solution came, and that the mother should realize his presence and he know that he hao. been recognized. These hopes have been granted them, and they now. patiently and resignedly await the end. The president and Mrs. McKinley. to gether with other relatives from the East, came earlv in the morn'ng. the latter part of the journey being made on a special tram. Thej- were taken to the homestead as rapidly as possible, and, as they en tered tho sick room, the dying woman ral lied and for a moment plainly evidenced her recognition of her son and others about her. As her son entered the room, accompa nied by his wife and Miss Mabel McKln-lej-. tho sister of the president. Miss Helen said: "Mother, here are William and Ida." 1 he president kneeled bj- her bedside, kissed his mother tenderlv- and reverentlj-. and as he did so she put her arm about his neck and signified that she knew him. She also recognized the president's wife and reached her hand towards her. She rec ognized Mabel McKinlej- and Jack Duncan. It seemed to friends that she had been awaiting the arrival or her son. Soon after, she lapsed into an unconscious state and the strength that had been husbanded for the last meeting of mother and son seemed to leave her. At 11:30. Mother McKinlej' was resting easily. Dr. Phillips, at his last visit, re ported that she was resting easier than any time during the day, and that the morning would see her alive. The president has remained almost con stantly at the bedside since his arrival and kept to-night's vigil, relieving others of the children, who have been so con stantly at the bedside.

THANKS T0REPUBLICANS. ReprenentnlYe Cowherd Says Kansas City's Prosperity Is In Spite of Ihera. Washington.! Dec. 7. (Special.) The fol lowing is taken from the Post: "Hon. William Strother Cowherd, ot Kansas Citj-, who is at the Ebbitt. is a tjpical Westerner, a selt-made man and so far has had a very successful public career. He has been maj or of his city and came to the Fiftj -fifth congress by a heavy major! tj-. ' 'Though we are prospering in Kansas Citj," said Mr. Cowherd, 'we are not so de luded as to give the credit to Republican legislation. We've got about tho finest country on earth, and even the Republican partj couldn't keep It forever In a de pressed condition. Politicallj-, Missouri is as solid for tho Democracj- as the everlast ing hills. If an election, w ere to be held right now tho opposition would hardly know what had struck it when the votes were counted. In fact, the state gets more Democratic every dav, more devoted to ltrjan, more convinced of the righteousness of the Chicago platform, more wedded to fiee silver.' " Mr. Cowherd concedes that the Demo cratic partj has more power than the Re publican p.irtj-. Admitting as he does that the Republican party cannot, interfere with prosperity in the AVest lie also concedes that the great organization to which he belongs proved strong enough to prevent prosperity everj- time it ev er had a chance. There Is nothing like belonging to an or ganization that is able to do things. Mr. Cow herd not having been able to defeat the passage of the tariff bill, looks very well. When confidential he does not regret tho fact of returning favorable business condl tiens and If he were in business he admits he would like it. From a political stand point, however, he is slightly fearful of the result. In this connection ex-Governor S. J. Craw ford, of Kansas, had something to saj' of interest. "Southeastern Kansas, my home, is about the garden spot of the Union in this J ear of grace, 1SS7. I hear," said he, "that a carload of canceled Kansas mortgages arc going to be oh exhibition at the Omaha exposition. Yes. we've been lifting debts faster than ever before known, and now have reached a stage of prosperity- and In dependence that makes us happj-, after long jears of depression and hard times." Mr. Cowherd denies that he Is going to introduce, put through congress and force the president to sign a bill to restore good old panic daj-s in the West and prevent pajment of mortgages.

LATTER BELIEVED HIS COMMITTEE WAS BEING SLIGHTED. Objected to the Proposed Distribution of the President's Message Gen eral Grosvenor .Beiclns His Assault ou the Civil Serv ice Law. Washington, Dec. 7. The session ot the house, to-day, though it lasted but two hours, witnessed a very lively skirmish over tho question of distributing the presi dent's message to the various committees clothed with jurisdiction over the subjects dealt with. The conflict of authoritj- came between the wajs and means committee and the banking and currencj- committee. The battle raged all along the line. During the debate. General Grosvenor, of Ohio, tired the first gun against the civil service law, and this also brought the friends and enemies of that measure into action. Mr. Johnson, ot Indiana. In a ringing warning, declared that if a bill to emasculate the civil service law were pass ed. It would meet the presidential veto. Eventually Mr. Dingley. In deference to the opposition of the members of the bank ing and currency committee, agreed to a modification of the order of distribution so as to send to the ways and means com mittee all matters relating to tho "reve nues, the bonded debt of the country and the treaties affecting the rev enues." The resolution was then adopted. Both Sides Claim a Victory. After the session. Chairman Walker claimed he had won a decisive victorj-, and that his committee, under the order, would have jurisdiction ot a measure to, as he expressed it, "convert the greenbacks into gold certificates." But members ot the waj-s and means committee insisted that the change ot verbiage In the order would not affect their jurisdiction, and that a measure such as the president suggested, if introduced in the house, would be re ferred by the speaker to their committee. Shortly after the house was called to order, Mr. Dingley, from the committee on waj-s and means, presented a resolution adopted by that committee for the dis tribution of the president's message to the several committees having jurisdiction of the various subjects treated. The report gives the ways and means committee jur isdiction of all the portions relating to the revenues, the national finances, the public debt and the preservation of the public credit. A very considerable debate followed upon which the language of the resolution meant and the Issue as to juris diction of the currency problem as between the waj-s and means and the banking and currencj' was sharpij- raised. Before tho debate, which lasted over an hour, had been concluded, the house was plunged into a debate on the' currency problem. Dingley and Wulker Clash. Mr. Walker, after the re-reading of the resolution, asked, with some heat, what was left to his committee. Mr. Dinglej- replied that all matters re lating to banking and currencj-, under the resolution, would go to the banking and currencj- committee. "There seems to be a decided conflict of qpinion as to what matters refer to bank ing and currency," exclaimed Mr. Walker, rather sharpij-. Mr. Dinglej- protested that the language of the resolution was Identical with that of former resolutions on the same subject, but he was immediately bombarded with ques tions as to the practical effect of the reso lution's language. Mr. Ballej-, of Texas, the minority lead er, attacked the flank of Mr. Dinglej-. He wanted to know specificallj- whether a measure to effectuate the recommendations ot the president on the currencj- would go to the waj3 and means or the currency committee. Mr. Dingley avoided a direct response. "It it proposed to retire the greenbacks in the manner recommended by the presi dent, where would it go?" asked Mr. Ballej-. Mr. Johnson, Republican, of Indiana, pressed Mr. Dinglej- along the same line. Mr. IlliiKle Hard Pressed. "I would leave the determination of that question to the speaker," at last replied Mr. Dinglej-. The house laughed. "It Is to avoid that verj- thing." ex claimed Mr. Johnson, "that I desire this question to be made clear now. Does the chairman of the wajs and means commit tee think a bill embodjing the principle ot tho president's, recommendation affects the redemption fund?" "I think it docs." replied Mr. Dinglej. "Then tho gentleman indirectlj- answers our question." exclaimed Mr. Johnson. Bj- this time, it being apparent that de bate would be required to dispose of the is sue at question. Mr. Dinglej- and Mr. Bil ley arranged for thirtj- minutes on a side. Mr. Walker then got the floor ami In-dlgnantlj- protested that If the questions relating to our legal tender moncj-, which lay at the vcrj- foundation of our curren cj" and banking laws, were to como under the jurisdiction of the wajs and means committee, the committee on binkin nnd currency might as well bo dissolved. If it was to be shorn ot its responsibllitie,vv hy continue it? Mr. Walker's Complaint. He avowed that in the last congress his committee had been steadllj- disregarded. Its members had cooled their heels in tho speaker's 10bb. he said, and when at Iat thej- were allowed to bring in a bill, the previous question had been dem.inded with out permission for debate, and he had been allowed to address the house only by unan imous consent. Mr. Cox, Democrat, of Tennessee, tho senior Democratic member of the currencj committee. seconded the protest of Mr Walker. The president's recommendations as to national bank circulation, he said, were inextricably Interwoven with the proposition to retire the greenbacks. If tho barking and currency committee was to do anything, he submitted that Its hands should not be tied. He expressed the opin ion that the object of the resolution was so to divide the subject that nothing prac tical would result. Mr. Wheeler. Democrat, of Alabama at this point got the floor and ued a few min utes In a plea for a government armor plate plant in Alabama. CII1 Service Law Attacked. He was followed by Mr. Grosvenor. Re publican, of Ohio, who diverted the whole course or the debate by an attack on the civil service law which was several timrs enthusiastically applauded both by num bers on the floor and spectators In the galleries. At the outset he repudiated the Idea that opposition to1 the civil servlcs law involved an affront to the president. Congress was empowered to deal with the subject and the president had reterrcd it to congress. He heartily agreed with the president "that there were places in the classified service which ought to be ex empt." "I am glad." said Mr. Grosvenor, "to go that far with the president, even if 1 am ccmpellcdto part company with him whf-n he sajs the civil service sjstem has the official sanction ot the people." Mr. Grosvenor declared th it he had kept in touch with the sentiment of the eoun-trj- and that if the question were submit ted to tho people west of the Allcghcnj mountains it would be buried under their overwhelming condemnation. Upronrious Applause. His remarks in denunciation' of "life ten ure in office" were met with unroanous applause from Vie galleries in whicn mem bers on the lloo f hcartilv- joined. This was a gov eminent for the pe-efplc and bj- tne peo ple, he declared, and ro man should be ex cluded from participation in the executive branch or the government bj- accident of birth or the misfortune of earij- education, who was otherwise qualified. Ohio, he said, had repudiated tho civil service law. and was opposed to building up an office holding class in this countrj". Mr. Brossius, Republican, of Pennsylva nia, the chairman of the committee on civ 11 service, defended the law, and. the presi dent's interpretation of it. It was tor the executive to administer it. He had full power to correct an) mistako that had been made and he thought Its administration should be leit there. Ho thought any at tempt to legislate upon the question must be regarded as an indignity to the execu tive. Mr. Ballej-. Democrat, of Texas, com mended Mr. Grosvenor s. utterances against building up an oliiceholding class in this countrj a doctrine h. said, which was al most literali.v embodied in the Chicago platform. (Democratic applause.) Mr. A heeler. Democrat, ot Kentucky, avowed himself a spoilsman in sjmpathy with the proposition to repeal the law. Mr. Urosveuor Assailed. Mr. Johnson. Republican, of Indiana, aft er some opening remarks about the stu pendous lolly of appealing a bimetullic commission to roll over Europe, made a strong speech in derense of the civil ser vice law. General Grosvenor he charged with being derelict to his duty as a Re publican. That partj-. he said, was unalterably- pledged to the support of the law. Benjamin Harrison and William McKinlej-, the most distinguished exponents of Its policies, had fought for the law in no uncertain language, and General Grosvenor he thought well merited the rebuke admin istered to him by Mr. Bailey, when the latter charged him with supporting the Chicago platform. (Laughter.) He marveled that the mouthpiece ot the administration had fallen so low. No por tion ot the president's message met with more heartj- indorsement from him than that relating to the civil service, and he warned ills colleagues that if they put through a bill in antagonism to the law It would bo vetoed. Moreover, he said, it was a mistake to imagine that the sentiment of the countrj" opposed it. The law was heartilj- approved bj all cccot a few "der-ener-ate noliti- cians," who opposed it from selfish mo tives. The trouble was not with the law, but with its administration bj- spoilsmen. Missourinns Break Into It. Mr. Cochran. Democrat, of Missouri, In a satirical speech, spoke of the injustice of turning over a subject which Mr. Walker had freelv admitted he knew all about to Mr. Dinglej-. who had fathered a tariff bill that had already produced at $10,000,009 deficit. Mr. Bland, Democrat, of Missouri, averred that it was well understood that nothing would be done with the currency problem. and Mr. Bodine. Democrat, of Missouri, alleged that the civil service law was a humbug which the West and South opposed. The latter gave some amusing Il lustrations of its operations, and caused a laugh bj- the statement that Mr. Cleveland had been some time in the White House before he dlscov ered that the United States were not bounded on the West by the Allc-ghenj- mountains. During the progress of tho debate Messrs. Valker and Johnson had. consulted with Mr. Dingley and a modification of the reso lution or distribution was agreed upon. It struck out the words: "The national finances, the public debt, the preservation or the government credit." and gave the wavs and means committee jurisdiction over all matters in the message relating "to the revenue, the bonded debt ot the United States and to the treaties or the United A hen this amendment was presented the opposition withdrew and tho resolution was adopted without division. The house then, at 2 o'clock, adjourned.

XATIO-S OF ELROI'E ARE SEEKING ITS I11VMEMBERMEAT. bulled states Has n Direct Concern in the Matter, but Japan Majr Huve to Be Reckoned With Present Status of the Case. Washington, Dec. 7. The German ad vance in China is being watched with keen, interest in official and diplomatic circles here, ow ing to the latest cable reports that Germanj- has followed up her occupation or Kiao-Chau bay and rortitications by sending an armed force inland and occu pjing the town ot Kiao-Chau. While it is said That the United State3 has no direct concern in the trouble, every development is being observed as a rart of the process by which the larger nations of Europe are seeking the dismemberment of the Chinese empire. As one diplomatic official stated: "It is the absorption of the Orient by the Occident." In such a mov ement it is understood that the position of this government would h that of a disinterested observer, alwaja active, however, to protect those American interests which have been built up at tha large treatj- ports. At present, there is no suggestion that these may be affected, but tho controversy Is assuming such a phase bj- Gcrmanj-'s forward march that It may extend at any time bejond the question ot occupying Kiao-Chau baj- and involve the treaty ports as well as all China. Tills is the view taken by some of the best post ed diplomatic officials. .It is said also that If the process goes on. Europe must not leave out of account Japan, as there Is good reason to believe that Japan will Insist 'on recognition If there is to be any occupation of Chinese territory. From an authoritativ o source, the follow ing statement was made as to the general status of the German-Chinese case: Kiao-Chau Is one of the most important harbors on the Chinese coast. It is mid way between the northern and southern portions of the Chinese coast, and for that reason has a commanding; strategic im portance. The harbor Is broad and deep, and is particularly adapted for the uses of a large fleet. The Chinese government recognized the Importance of the harbor, and had determined to improve the forti fications and bring the place up to modern standards. The advantages ot the harbor were shown last Jear, when Russia se cured permission to quarter her fleet there temporarily-. Tfie present fortifications aro not strong, being far short of those for merly at Port Arthur. They serve mainly as a garrison for a small Chinese force. BaBck of the garrison and some miles in land is the small town of Kiao-Chau. China has not made anj- preparations for war, by assembling troops or ships to re sist Germany's landing. It is still believed that a settlement will be reached through peaceful means, and that it will be honora ble to China as well as satisfactory to Germanj-. Berlin, Dec. 7. Emperor William has or dered the number or volunteers for tho China expedition to be increased to 1.0U0 men. a London, Dec S. A special 'dispatch from Shanghai sajs: "On Friday last Captain Becker -with 30 German marines left Kiao-Chau bay to oc-eupj- the surrounding villages, whence they proceeded to capture the city. The Chin ese torts opened fire, and the Germans re plied, killing three or the garrison, which thereupon fled In disorder. "The Chlneso general In command was captured, but afterwards liberated. Sever al German sailors were Injured by stones flung by the Inhabitants ot tho village. In return ror this the head men ot thesa villages were beaten with bamboo sticks by order ot the German commander. "It is reported here that China Is willing to pav- an Indemnity or 1 000.000 taels (about T7S3.2S)) and to grant all the German de mands, including the temporary cession of Kiao-Chau bay and adjoining territory." London. Dec. S. A dispatch to the Times from Pekln confirms the report that China, hoping for the evacuation ot Kiio-Chau. agrees unconditionally to all demands ot Germanj-. i The Times, dealing editorially with the situation at Kiao-Chau. notes that the foregoing telegram enumerating the Ger man demands does not Include the per manent occupation or Kiao-Chau. and points out that the evidence Is conflicting: as to whether thi3 was officially demanded. It sajs: "In anj- case, now that the other demands have been conceded, what will be the grounds lor Insisting on a perma nent occupation? The double success ln Hajti and China, demonstrating the prac tical value or a strong fleet readj- to act at short notice in anj- part or the world, will probably give a coup de grace to tho declining opposition to the naval bill." Berlin. Dec. 7. Dr. Stubel. the German consul at Shanghai, has been ordered to go to Kiio-Clnu and establish a regular German administration. The Kolntsche Volks Zcltung says that the coal deposits in the province ot Shan Tung, which will become available to Germanj-. with railway and mining concessiona are most valuable.
