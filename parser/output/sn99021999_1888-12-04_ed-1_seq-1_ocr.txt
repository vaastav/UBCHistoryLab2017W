I Around congiess to day there were many fonjertiircs as to what answer will bo Hindu by Iho secretary of war to Senator Halo's resolution , adopted last October , calling for nn explanation of the issuance of the notorious rious Donet circular leltcr , directing the lemovalof women and children in the nrsu- imlH and armories , to innko room for demo crats ( icnej-nl Delict told the correspondent of Iho Indianapolis Journal six weeks ago that the circular was issued upon the direc tion , or nttho suggestion , of Secretary Knill- roll , but ho stated subsequently , in order to extricate the secretary from the hole into which ho had placed him , that ho ( Henul ) was alone icsponsiblo for thu order , and that lie conceived it himself. The ( utter ex planation was made , of course , for the pnr- ] K > SC of relieving the administration of the odium which the responsibility would cast upon it. Now that there will bo no neces sity of shielding the administration , llcnct , it is said , feels like vindicating luin- Hclf , in order that ho may not be in bad repute with the new administration. Some curiosity is expressed as to whether Kndi- cott or Henel will assume Iho responsibilily. i OMMI.NTS ov TIII : MI s < Air. No bolter commentary on I'residsnt Cleve land's message could be desired than that given by the members of the house during the reading of the document this afternoon , when Iho democrats applaitdcd cm tain fea tures and the republicans hissed other per tions. When the refeienco to the surplus in the treasury as not being intended to force free trade was read the democrats immedi ately began n vigorous applause and the re publicans gave vent to a stage laugh thai iliowned the hand clapping. The contrast between the demonslralioiiso n thu two sides was so great Hint involuntarily almost e\ery eye turned towaid Mrs. Cloveliml and her mother , who sat on the. Iront se.it in the dip lomatic gallery. They looked serious With very few exceptions and these are among tin ? protectionist democrats opinions as to the meiits of the message are confined with in party lines. Ths democrats gen erally nro glad thai Hie pre-iidenl has again proclaimed in favor of fieq tiade , and , nn Cl.aiimnn Mills puts it this evening , "aro proud to see the president still llymg Iho flag of reform. " Mr. Mills docs nol believe the tree trade utterances of the president in his message a year ago had anj thing to do with Iho change of public opinion as to the aims of the dcmocralic parly , or that they contributed to Mr. Clove- land's defeat. Do hcai til v endorses all the president has over said about tariff refoi m nnd free trado. The two Hrcekonridpes , who are democratic members of the house com imtleo on ways and means , heartily ap plauded the sentiment of the message as il was rend , and declrred that it is the best document over sent to congress. They , too , lire gratified to see Hint Mr. Cleveland's stand on the tori IT has not been shaken by the iccent election. They join Mr. Mills in declaring that the representatives of the democratic party in congressdo not intend to niter or amend the tariff platform , but say It will stand ns a land 111:11 : k for future com- palgns. They are in favor of simply reaf- llrniiiig the platform in the next struggle for the presidency. Sena tor Hansom , of Noith Carolina , expressed the view of the democrats In the upper branch of congress when he said : "It is the ablest of them ull , and shows thai our louder is standing by his guns. " The repub licans in both houses use some very vigorous language in denouncing the message. .Sen ator Allison tins evening said"II Is un patriotic. " The senator has special refer ence to the second paragraph in the message , which casts serious doubl upon the wisdom of the foundation of our republic , because it Is "founded upon thn fiucdom of the people. " Do thinks Iho president has struck a very cruel blow at the American form of govein- mem , simply because its citizens did not 10- Inin him in power. li Senator Sherman said : "It contains notb- Ing now , except certain forms of complaint. " [ ( ; Senator Cullom said : "Mr. Cleveland seems determined to go out with a bluster. Ho Is disappointed , scolds severely and ap pears to doubt not only the wisdom of the present people , but the fnimers of our con stitution. " Kcpiesontntivo McKinley , of Ohio , said : "It is a post mortem examination of the democratic platform. " ( lOiieral Urosvenor , also of Ohio , said : "Tbo message Is a motion for a now trial , but the court bus no jurisdiction and thu ver dict will have to slund. " These views give a coed idea of those expressed - pressed by nil men in congress , who have so far given utterance to their opinions of the message. In some quarters there is great indignation over the communistic and an archistic sentiments' of the president , and several meniL'Ois ' of congress go to far as to nay that Jolmn Most ami his followers can llnd texts in the president's message to lire the hearts of their converts for yeais to come. The soldiers are also indignant. They 10- gnrd the language of the ptcsidcnt , where ho refers to pensions , as "gratuities granted upon no oilier real ground than the needy condition of the applicant , or for reasons less valid , " as an unnecessary Insult to the vet erans , nut they add thai it is only in the line that he has followed ever since ho went to the white house , and that in the future il will cause the soldiers to stand more solidly together than they have ever stood.

JHVIH II-ON UlCl SilO.V. All of the Nobiaska delegation , with the exception of Congressmen McShano ami Laird , were in their seats at the opening of the session to-day , Senator .Manderson and Kciiresonlutlvo Dm soy having arrived hero several days ago , and Senator Paddock reaching - ing the city on Saturday by way of Now York , There were many inquiries on the lloor of the senate respecting thu probabil ities of the Manderson succession. The in complete reports , us to thu composition of Â„ western legislatures , have made it very dilH- , ' cult to eastern men to learn the exact situa tion. Senator Mumloi son \\iis heartily con gratulated over thu overwhelming republican majority , which seems 10 assure his re-elec tion. The senator himself expressed quut lonflilencu in the outcome to si-scud of his friends. Ho Is said to have intimated that it would not bu necessary for him to return to Nebraska during thu legislative session. This is probably thu best evidence of the complete Batltalaction which Senator Maiiderson feels over the situation. A piomiuont Nobrnnka-politlelnn expressed the opinion this evening that there would bo lit least live senatorial candidates iu thu Hold In thu coming contest In that state , and that among them would bo Representative Dorsoy. Ho named ns the eonteutniits , ox- Congressmen \iilontiiie , Judge Crounz , Governor Saunders , Governor Thnyer and .ludgo Kcese , of the tmproinu court , ami added that the friends of Judge Uroff , of Omaha , were urging strongly uK | > n that , gentleman to allow the use of his name. Do I nddcd , that in his opinion , the senatorial , I contest next January will not bu entirely I devoid of interest , nnd while C ] cue nil Man- I dersnn'a success at present seemed assured , ; ha might llnd it to his interest to taku u trip ' to Lincoln befoio the culniiuuiton of thu OIITOIIIl'S 

AMENDMENT. Delegate Clifford , of Dakota , has prepared an amendment to the law. providing for tlio opening of the Sioux Indian reservation in Nebraska and Dakota , which ho will intro duce in thu house at once , and will urge its Immediate adoption , with a view to securing the opening of the reservation obefore next r t < i rcscrvntion shall bo onenH without the con sent of the Indians , who slmll bo given $1 nn ncre for nil Innds taken during the first two venrs , 75 cents nn acre for thu land taken on the reservation during tlio next iwo years , and ' .0 cents an ncre for the land remaining nnd not taken nt the end of the first four years. The amendment further provides that the government shall make n deposit of fJ)00iKX ) ) , Instead of * IXH,000 ( ) , as a perma nent fund , to drawfjperccnt interest , for the benetlt of the Indians who own the reserva tion , and it appropriates * 2ooK)0 ( ) for survey ing the land to be opened to settlement JudgeXJifTord has made some inquiry in the house , and says he has no doubt that his amendment , or something subslantiully like it , Hill bo adopted without delay. * TIP. Hefore the president's message was re ceived at the house to ilnj ono of. tlio "legis lative agents" of a Wall street concern passed the word mound thu lobbies that the message would contain a reference to tin Oiithwaito bill for the extension of the 1'acillc railroad's bonded debt. Ho added that ho had an intimation , but he was not positive that the reference would bo fav orable to the bill. "Now , " said the gentle man , "if this proves to be true.Umon Pacific will be good stock to buy , and 1 think it safe to saj that it will jump nt leasl six pjiuts. If you have any spare cash , look ou' for the message and govern > ourself accordingly. " In response to this tip those who were ad vised of what to expect , eaj'crl.y scanned the copies of the message winch weiodistubtited , in the hope of linding a "pointer. ' ' Thu promised paragraph was nilsiing and the til was worthless , nnd ns n result thcio were several disappointed congressmen and house employes who saw a faint opportunity to re coup the losseu sustained bi betting upon the wrung man. * 

OFIII r si IMI ; . The Nobiasha delegation is alioady over whelmed with applications for ofllce. Kvei'i mad brings a new wave to inld to the volume of the Hood. Enough applications have al ready been piesc ated for land olllces to sup ply every land district in thu United States , while each loun , with a postolllee , seems tc bo hastening to fall into line with as many implications as possible for the position of a local Nnsby. Of course nothing can bo done in the matter of up- pointments until after the new administra tion begins its work , outlines its policy with regard to appointments and removals and civil service loform , and until the Mander son succession is settled so that the delega tion itself can agree upon the distribution of patronage. rnusdN M , .

It is urged thai a western man is needed at the head of the interior depart ment , and one who , ns a lawier , has had practical experience in dealing with land matters If .Senator Allison is nol tendered tliuticusurydepaitment.it is felt that Mr. Tnnrston will be a strong possibility. With Allison out of the cabinet , there is a feeling thai J. K. Clarkson , of Iowa , would bu Intely to bo selected as Secretary Vilas' successor.

Long before the hour for the meeting of the second session of the Fiftieth congress the galleries of the house were filled with spectators , nnd the blight diesses of Indies formed a brilliant frame to the picture piosonted on the floor below.

[ Special Telegram to Tin : Uni : j In an interview with the cor respondent of a southein paper Senator In- . galls said yesterday : "Tlio race question nt the south remains , as it bus always been , and for the next geiieiatlou at leasl II will con tinue to be , the most Important and formid able in our politics. Tlio change from slav ery to freedom , from subordination to legal equalitj , has complicated instead of simpli fied the situation. So tar from solving the fatal problem , it has added new elements of difficulty and danger. Unless history is n false teacher , it is not possible for two dis tinct races , not homogeneous that is , which cannot assimilate by intermarriage and minglmir of blood to exist upon terms of practical political equality under the same government. One or the other must go to the wall. The time will come when the negroes , aware of their strength and numbers , will Insist uuon their equality under the law , and then there will be a ensis which may become a catastrophe. There Is but one practical suggestion that offers any present relief , and that is n national legislative law , under which every voter should bo entered upon the poll lists , and then have the elections under the con trol of supervisors appointed for that nur- pose Tins might not secure fair elections , bill It would afford the means ot ascci tain- ing whether they weie lair or not , so that congiess could act Intelli gently In deriding whether the contest ants were entitled to their seats In either house and In the electoral college. The blacks have the same legal rights on this continent Unit whites have. They are natives and are citi zens They have as much right to nslt the whites to ictiie or separate themselves as the whites have to require them to do so. Hut the original environment of the African race was tropical , and It may bo that on the southern shot cs of the gulf , or the West India islands , or along the low lands of Mexico , regions friendly to Arrican blood , Iho enfranchised millions , under Iho piotee- lion ot the United States , subjects of its government and full sharers in its citizen ship , may yet accomplish their destiny and fullll tlio prophecy that Ethiopia shall stretch out its hands to Oed and rejoice.

The only people wet thy of attention , except the political ele ment , who were nlfected by Iho affair , were the smaller shopkeepers along Iho route , many of whom were even loud in complaint of the absolute absurdity of the thing ; which without any tangible reason that they could see , compelled them to shut their shops and lose a good day's business , all for nothing. Thostrcets weie , to be sure , densely crowded with sightseers , but they were only lie Tower and middle classes , and their uUitudu towu ; d Daudm and the whole business was apathetic. Tlio procession itself was half fanned of the offscourings of the Paris slums und represented nothing but vicious Idleness on a lark.

Wo view with prule and satisfaction this bright picture of our country's growth and prosperity , while only a close scrutiny devel ops a somber shading. Upon more careful inspection wo llnd the wealth and luxury of our cities mingled with povortv and wretch edness and mucniuncrativo toil. A crowded and constantly Increasing urban popu lation suggests the impoverishment of rural .sections and discontent with agricultural pursuits 'Iho farm- er's son , not satiMlod with his father's simple and laborious life , Joins the eager chase for easily auiuircd wealth. Wo discover that the fortunes ro- ali/cd by our iminufacturors nro no longer solely the reward of study , indus try and enlightened foicsight , but that they result from the discriminating favor of the government and are largely built upon undue exaction from the masses of our own people. The gulf between employers and the em ployed Is constantly wideningand classes are rapidly forming , ono comprising tliu very rich ami powerful , while in Another are found the toiling poor.

Instead of limiting the trib ute drawn from our citi/cim to nccossitlett of its economical administration , the government pci.slsts in exacting from the .substance of the people's millions , which , unapplied and useless , lie dormant in its treasury This ll.igrant Injustice and thlu breach of faith and obligation add to ox tor * lion the danger attending diversion ot tlio currency of tlio country liom the legitimate channels ol business , Under the same laws by which these re sults me produced , the government perinltH many millions more to bu added to the cost of living of our people aii'l to bu taken from our consumers which unreasonably wwell the profits of n small but powoiful minority. The people tnust still bo taxed for the uuppoi t of the country under thu op eration of tariff laws. I till the mass of our eiiucns is Inordinately burdened beyond any usuful public purpose and for the benefit of a favore.il fow. i'ho government under pretext of nn exorcise of its taxing power , enters giatuitously Into partnership with those favorites , to their ad vantage nnd to the injury of u vast majority ufour , people. This is not equality before the law. The existing situation is Injiiilous to the health of our entire body politic. .
