BONNELLE How dear to this heart la the stock ing of childhood when fond recoV lectlon presents it to view! On Christmas St. Nick tame from frost . whitened wildwood with every loved toy which niy Infancy knew. The wide spreading chimney, the ... sled which stood by It, .a horse and some books I remember them all-: a doll for my sister, and baby house nigh It, and then the full stocking which hung on the wall the Santa Claus stocking, the bountiful stocking, the Chrlstnms morn storking which hung on the wnll! The well stuffo;! envelope I hailed as n treasure as early that morn ing 1 opened my-eye and found ther the source of an exquisite pleasure, the purest and sweetest that nature supplies. How ardent I seized It with hands th.it were glowing and back to my white sheeted lied went with all, then soon, ' with the emblems of love overflow ing, was happy In what to my lot did befall-the Santa Claus stocking, the generous stocking, the Christ mas morn stocking which bung on , the wall: - How sweat through Its round open , top , to explore - ft ' as - poised on my knee If t-nMncA to mv vlewl Not hot, tempting breakfast could -make me Ignore It for longer at most than a minute or two. And now, far removed from the loved situation, the tear of regret will Intrusively fall fanev reverts to my youth's habitation . and sighs o'er the stocking which hung on the' wall , the Santa Claus stocking, the plethoric stocking, the Christmas morn stocking which hung on the wall! But grown people And there's a later sensation as grateful as any they felt long ago. It comes when they witness the glad exultation which on Christmas morning their own off spring show. And now, dear old Santa Claus, let me petition your favor for children, both large ones and small. Bring all the bright hopes to the fullest tuition that rest In each stocking which hangs on the wall the wealthy child's stocking, the poor urchin's stocking; yes, fill every stocking which hangs on the wall!

The little ones, all less than twelve years old, provide the stage entertain ment on these occasions, and there never Is any Interference by the au thorities.

Admission was by Invitation only, and when tbe programme began the house was crowded to the doors, the balcony being given op largely to poor children of the east side. Some of tbe actors were mere babies, but they went through the business like veterans, and the gravity of most of them when staging their comic songs was Immensely amusing.

One might read the paragraph relating to the observance of the holiday bajf a hundred times and not become weary.' Tbe ChrUtmaa spirit Is everywhere evident In tbe chapters devoted to' the holiday making. From tbe beginning, when the hero, his three friends and his faithful servant start for Dlngley Dell, to the hour of their return there Is Christmas In every sentence: As brisk as bees, If not altogether as light as fairies, did the four PlokwICkians assemble on the morning of the S2d day of December in the year of grace In, which these their faithfully recorded ad-i Ventures were undertaken and accom plished. Christmas was close at hand In all his bluff and hearty honesty. It was the season ef hospitality, merriment and opes heartedness. The old year was pre paring. It'.te an ancient philosopher, to call his friends around him and amid the sound of feasting and revelry to pass gently and calmly away. Oay and merry was the time, and right gay. and merry were at least four of the numerous hearts that were gladdened by Its coming. .
