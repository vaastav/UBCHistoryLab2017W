Under exiting laws the railroad com trnl nf all heating of railroad cars except on mixed trains, tin dor the amended bill now ponding In tho legislature me railroad commission will have control of all car heating in tho State. This Is as it should be. Tho rapid development of naval science has led to the Invention of a now engine of destruction which, though small In size, has enormous capacity for destruc tion. This Is the torpedo motor launch which Is so small It can eaMly ho car ried In tho space of a battleship' launch on the deck of a ship and loosed at will ngalnst tho enemy. Considerable comment has been oc casioned by the fact that tho new Supreme Court of Vermont will ho made tip of only four judges and that conse quently thero may be a deadlock over tome Important case. The Important point is mndo that in effect in tho case of tho former supreme bench, which contained seven members, appeals wero heard by an even number of Judges owing to tho dis qualification of the judge who originally tried the case In tho court below. Now thoro will bo no disqualification and at least three Judges must agree in order to overturn a verdict in the superior court. vEiionxxns acciijknt and otiii:u CATASTHOPIIKS. The accident on the ltutland railroad M Vergonnos In which three persons are known to have lost their lives and thirty throe, passengers wero Injured was the most disastrous collision In tho history of Vermont railroads. Tho fatalities wero much larger than at Vorgennes In tho JJnrtfoid bridge disaster on Februnry 5, IfcST, but in that accident tho night tram from Doston ran oft tho rails and uropped to tho Icy surface of tho river below, killing thirty-two passengers and Injuring forty-one, of whom one later died. The most serious railroad accident in Vermont previous to that at Hartford was tho Harlow brldgo accident, a mile and a half below Northfiold, Whon on December 11, 186", car containing workmen who wero replacing a bridge, wero dashed Into tho chasm, fifteen being killed or so In jured that thoy wero crippled for life. It Is noteworthy that tho Harlow bridge disaster resulted from carelessness simi lar to the apparent negligence which caused tho Vergennos accident. The workmen had beon to Northfiold for their lunch and on the return trip the engi neer who was backing tho car nllowetl hla engine to run at too high a rate of upeed close to tho brink. When too lata he realised the danger and reversed his engine, but tho coupling broko and the car -was shot over the abutment to the frozen ground below, a drop of seventy feet The officials of the Ilutland railroad an nounce that tho cause of tho accident at Vergennes was the dropping of a ploco of gravel Into tho anglecock of tho air brakes, whloh made It Impossible to stop the train. This docs not explain, how ever, why a heavy gravel train was tl lowed to approach a station nt a rate of speed which could not bo controlled, when the engineer knew tho other trains wore In the habit of meeting nt that point, or why the engineer did not comply with tlio usual railroad regulations and make siiro that his brakes wero In working or der. The opinion has been expressed that If stoves had not leen usod to heat tho cars no deaths would liavo occurred as tho threo ladles whoso bodies wero badly burned nro known not to have been killed outright, by tho force of tho collis ion. Thoro is a law on Vermont's Btatuto books designed to prevent tho u.so of Moves for heating railroad trains, but mixed trains nro expressly excepted In tho statute, tho lnnguago being "No pas senger, mail or baggage cars, other than a mixed train, etc." Tho use of stoves In passenger cars on mixed trains Is thus rendered a still greater problem for both railroad managers and legislators. Tho causes of this accident should bo thor oughly sifted, nnd If tho engineer of tho gravel train or othor employe or oillclal was responsible for tho holocaust ho cr thoy should bo punished accordingly, it Is tho most difficult problem. Tho ssuo of unequal distribution of the bur- don of local government nnd public Im provements, Is ono whose consideration enn not well bo postponed In view of tho extent to which it has figured In party platform anil political campaign, and Its solution demands from legisla tors the wisest nnd most patriotic citizen ship as well as fiir-rcnchltig statesman ship. Tho question of appropriations for Stato purposes during tho coming two years Is anothor Important matter to bo con sidered. Tho legislators now know prne tlcally what sums will bo needed for ex traordinary purposes nnd it Is also easy to llguro what the State's total Income will b bnrrlng several sources of rov enuo which remain to bo disposed of. These are the propositions to tax thoso deposits In national hanks' which bear interest nnd to enforce tho payment of ci license by thoso wholesnlo lUpjor houses of other States that desire to conduct sales In Vorimmt. Careful estimates have been rnado in relation to tho Increased revenue likely to bo received from the enlarged tax nn railroads, from the act to onablo persons to deposit money In more than one savings bank In tho State, which nhme Is expected to bring In a considerable sum, nnd a fairly good Idea can be formed In a few days ns to tho probable Increased revenue from other sources. Important bills relating to railroad rates, nnd the railroad commission and Its work ate still pending, nnd the chances are that the."- will bo made tho subject of considerably debate, In view of the increased powers asked for by the commission and the extent to which tho Interests of tho public aro Involved in all these measures. Autemnblle legisla tion will be another fruitful subject of discussion, although the most praclicil measures In this direction nro likely to be the adoption of provisions looking to tho enforcement of greater care on tho part of those operating horseless vehicles. The local option law nnd tho various amendments proposed remain to be con sidered and these subjects aro likely to be mada the occasion of considerable oratory In birth branches of t lie Legis lature, It Is not expected that the prin ciple of local option will be disturbed In view of the pled-io Involved in the re publican platform, but tho chances aro that considerable starch will be Injected Into some of the provisions of the law looking to Increased temperance. This list of subjects not disposed of by our State lawmakers Is far from com plete, to say nothing of possibilities growing out of the report of tho com mittee on investigation, but It Is suf ficient to Indicate that the Legislature still has a busy season before It; and we may have nnother Thanksgiving If the body adjourns by Christmas. comma where it manifestly uciuhk. when that body assembles next month, It tho courts should decide tho statute to mean one thing ns much as another; but manifestly such legislation enn not do post facto and undo what has already beon done as rogards tho granting of licenses. It Is understood that New Hampshire's secretary of Stnto has In terpreted tho section In question :.s though a comma stood whero It manifest ly belongs, but what tho courts will do cldo In relation to this courso remains to be determined. In the meantime It behooves Vermont s committee on the revision of laws to keep Its caso of commas nnd semi-colons under lock and key as well as within eonven lent rrneh when It comes to amendments to tho liquor law, for nobody seems to bo able to predict Just what will happen when men try to mix liquor legislation and punctuation. HK.MAINI.VO WORK OK TIII3 I.KGI i.ATimrc. Tho Legislature of Vermont has al ready made gratifying progress In It work in tho direction or Improved publi MCENSH AM) PUNCTUATION. Vermont's Legislature upon resuming Its interrupted session next week will take up among other things the modifica tion of tho license law, and It is expected that a number of radical changes will bo made, Including the exacting of license fees from wholesale dealers of other States doing business In Vermont, so that our statute shall not discriminate against our own citizens. Judging from the experience of vari ous other Now England States, ono of tho problems Vermont's saloons will oo bilged to fnce in connection with legis lation regarding Hie sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage, will be tho sprink ling of punctuation marks In tho right place so that they shall not defeat tho plain intent of .he lnw. It will bo recall ed that a semi-colon created endless confusion and litigation In connection with tho licenso law of Massachusetts, and now a simple but Insurmountable comma Is playing the mischief with New Hampshire's liquor statute. Tho section of the New Hampshire con cerned Is that dealing with the tlmo when tho people of town.) nnd clttos shall vote on tho question of granting li censes for the sale of Intoxicants. The purpose and Intent of the law hnvo never been dlsputod. Tho plan wa.s that after November, 1000, the towns of the Stnte should vote every two years on the ques tion, whllo the cities should voto every four years. Tho Idea of tho originators of tho monsuro doubtless was that tho ctt les would generally vote for license an 1 that It would be well to have the mat tor settled for a long period, while tho towns would be more drslrous of shifting occasionally. How great a mlstako was made In tho general plan Is shown by tha sutprlolng results of the license votes in the cities this fall. The sentence In which tho present com ma complication arises recites tho first action to be taken after the passago of tho net, and continues: "At which spe cial meeting nnd nt each biennial election thereafter In November in tho towns and In tho cities nt the biennial election In IMC and every fourth year thereafter tho sense of tho voters shall bo taken." If a comma had been inserted after tho words towns in that sentence, tha pn!3 ont situation would not have arisen, but as matters nro now It Is asserted that Iho section does not explicitly state what tho law Is, and that, whllo It Is generally conceded that the Intention of tho Legls lature was to have towns voto every two years nnd cities every four, such an In, tent cannot bo shown In tho ambiguous sentence quoted. The temperance peoplo of New Hamp shire Insist thnt, under tho section a at present punctuated, tho towns can vola on llront-o only once In every four years, and, therofore, tho matter will undoubt edly be brought before the court for In terpretation. The general conditions bo Ing almost exactly similar to those pr-v ceding tho uernlcolon decision in Mnssa- i.icnxsiis koii nriiusnisTS a sun- 

ST1TUTI-1 1111,1.. it vrm n valuable feature nf the old prohibitory law, so called, of Vermont, that It recognized the fact that thoro aro legitimate nnd unobjectionable user, of alcohol and alcoholic liquors, nnd provided for an agency in every town, where such liquors could be pro cured for such purposes. No ono wno needed a jiltit of alcohol for a spirit lamp or to dissolve somo enmphnr gum, or brandy prescribed by the fam ily physician, had to go without be cause there was no place In his town whero the spirit or stimulant could bo obtained. The existing local option law bars all sales of nlcohollc liquors In no-llcense towns, for nny purpose whatever, no exception being made for medicinal, chemical or mechanical purposes. In this particular, ns. many towns which have no use for saloons or drinking places have romo to real ize, the existing law Is defective. A bill to remedy this defect was In troduced early In tho present session of the Legislature by Senator Manning of Kutlnnd. It would, If enacted, meet some of tho needs of tho situation, but Is not sufficiently guarded ugalnst possible abuse of the druggists' 11 reuse. A substitute bill has accord ingly been drawn by Senator Van Pat ten, to which he lias given much thought and care, and which seems to cover all the demands of tho case. It provides that In towns which vote no license, special meetings may bo call ed upon the petition of five per cent, of tho legal voters to decide whether or no licenses of the fifth class may be Issued to druggists. If a majority of the voters vote yes on that prop osition, then the selectmen may Issue licenses to druggists to sell for sacra mental, medicinal, mechanical and chemical purposes; but no such licenso shall be Issued to any but a registered pharmacist, whose petition for a li cense Is approved by two-thirds of the board of civil authority nnd by not less than half of the practicing phy sicians of the town, and who presents a oertirnte from the board of phar macy that he Is n fit and proper per son to receive such n license. Tho petitioner must furnish the bond of a suri-iy company in the sum or ono thousand dollars, which Is forfeitable upon a conviction for violation of the law. The foe for a druggist's license ten dollars. Hefore tho pharmacist sells nny llq uor, the purchaser thereof must sign a certificate, stating tho use to bo mndo of the Honor. whether for medicinal, sacramental, mechnnlenl or chemical purpose, nnd that he will not knowingly permit It to be used as a beverage or In any unlawful way. No physician Is permitted by tlio act ! to prescribe Intoxicating liquor to bo sold by a licensed druggist except for a specified person nnd for a specific complaint. A penalty of Imprison ment for not less than threo months, or a lino of not less than a hundred dollnrs, or both, Is fixed, for making a false certificate, or a false proscription or obtaining a prescription by deceit. Monthly reports of the amount of his sales are required from each holder of a fifth class license with an oath attached to tho effect thnt he has not mnde any sales in violation of tho act or of the laws of tho State. No druggist can hold any but a fifth class license for tho sale of liquors for medicinal, sacramental, m-a-chanlcal or chemical purposes. Only al cohol can be sold tor chomlcal or manu facturing pui poses,, and no sales of any kind can he mndo to minors, paupers, or persons sales to whom are prohlbUed by the present law. Tho bill contains forms of certificates and provision for tho filing of tho statements required, whloh nro to bo open to examination by nny citizen who wishes to sco them. This sulistltute bill has evidently been cniefully drawn In tho Interests of tem perance. If It becomes a law, ns we trust It may, ono Important result likely to fellow from It will be an Increaso of the number of towns thnt vote no on tho general question of licensing tho llquar trafllc. Wo should have strong hopes that many citizens of even the larger "open" towns and cities who have not been ready to vote to forbid nil sales of liquors for any purpose whatsoever, will under a ay which provides for lawful sales 'for medicinal, sacramental, median leal and chemical uses, voto no on tin question of the general licensing of tha liquor trafllc In their towns, and that i decldod Improvement In the general con dltlon as regards temperance, law and ordor will result from the Improved stat ute on the subject. II. PRllKINS, The fifth biennial report o (leorgc II. Perkins, the State geologist, which has just boun published, In con- j slderably larger thnn Its predecessors and contains the latest available sta tistics of tho erent stone industries of this State. Thoso show that great as have been tho production and sales of granite, marble and slnte in previous years tho amount for 1906 Is much larger as Is undoubted ly tho case for 1908. Thoso three kinds of stone constitute tho greater part of the mineral wealth of tho Stato nnd during tho year 190B tho sales wero more than $9,614,000 but how much more cannot be statod bo cause complete' returns could not bo obtained. It seems cortaln that tho sales of tho present year will exceed this amount. The mnrble quarrying and working companies nro larger and fewer than thoso dealing In grnnlto or state. At present twelve firms do nearly all of the quarrying of marblo In this Stnte. Those nro all large, strong companies nnd thoy furnish more thnn three fourths of all the building nnd monumental marble used In this country. Of less magnitude, but yet of great Importance Is the slate Industry of tho State. Thero are over forty companies now engaged In the slate business here, Vermont being second only to- Penn sylvania In tho nmount of slnte pro duced. Not only docs the report con tain a gcncrnl account of this Industry, but tho methods of preparing slate for use nre described with some detail. Tho growth of the grnnlto Industry during tho Inst few years has been very gratifying to Vcrmonters. No longer ago than 

ISSO thero were only twolvo quarries In operation mid tho total sales amounted to leas than ?C0, 000. Ten years later a much larger number of quurrles were being worked and their product was worth $fiSl,870. In 1900 tho sales of this stone reached n total of $1,113,738. In ,1905 to $4,935,000 and about a hundred quarries were In operation. Not less than 190 com panies nro reported as doing business the present year. While these aro tho great stone In dustrls, there are also sales of lime stone, sandstone, talc, soapstono, clays, marls and some copper ore. Tho report also gives a brief account of the penc beds of the Stnte and considers somo of the uses to which this material Is put. A careful study of the asbestos beds at Hclvldere mountain is presented and much Information of scientific value may be found in this part of the report. The report Includes several moro or less technic. .1 papers on the geology of different part,s of tho Stato and these will bo of permanent value. The first of these Is by Dr. C. H. Richard son of .Syracuse University, who has spent several years In a careful In vestigation of the geology of north eastern Vermont, especially In Essex, Caledonia and Orleans counties. This paper describes the various kinds or rock that aro found In the region studied nnd olso much of the topo graphy and mineral deposits. This Is followed by papers by Mr. G. n. Edson of Ft Albans, who gives nn Interesting historical sketch of the Cambrian age, a formation of much Importance In Vermont geology. In a following paper, Mr. Edson gives a de tailed nccount of the geology of the region about St. Albans. This must be of the greatest value to nnyon who desires to mnke any geological study of tho area described or to collect fos sils.

Washington, Doc. 3. Tho COth Congress begnn Its last session at noon to-day. It took the Senate M minutes to arrange 1t3 preliminaries and the Hotiso of Repre sentatives an hour. Tho Senate rccolvod from Ircsldent Roosevelt a long list of appointments for Its confirmation, and decldtd that as the nominations had boo.i received Wore the body had been or ganized formally, to mnko no confirma tions until the President's annual mes sage had been received and tho session started. Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania and Foraker of Ohio came forward with reso lutions of Inquiry regarding tho discharge of tho negro troops of tho 25th Infantry. One wns addressed to tho President and the other to tho secretary of war. Aft-jr the ripple of surprise had passed and Vice-President Fairbanks had suggested thnt It was unusual to transact business until tho President's message had beon received, the resolutions went over by unanimous consent. Senator Dupont t.f Dclnwnre took tho oath of office. The opening of the two houses was wi. v. l an mated throng which crowded the galleries. Not In years has n larger number of membor.-elect of the lower house pre sented themselves at the speaker's desk to take the oath of office. Death has been unusually active, nmong the membership during the interval be tween the close of the last session and the beginning of the present and Chap lain Couden feelingly called tho atten tlon of the body to the work of tho grim reaper." Speaker Cannon appointed Represon- itlve James II. Mann of Illinois as lember of the board of regents of tho Smithsonian Institute, vice Robert K. Iltt of Illiniis, decensed. The galleries of tho House wero rowded at an early hour. The absence f flowers on the desks of the members was much commented on but the or der of the speaker prohibiting tho floral display was generally commend ed. A similar rule was made in tlio Sennte two years ago. Mrs. Nicholas Longworth, daughter f the President, occupied a seat In the xecutlve gallery accompanied by Miss Hagner, the social secrotary to Mrs Roosevelt. The routine work of the House In Ident to opening day, was quickly dis patched, the roll call showing nearly hrec hundred members present Representative Bourke Cochran of New Vork, who recently married Miss Ide, wns the subject of hearty laughter when his personal request that he be permltt'd to absent himself for an in definite Drrlod on account of business was laid before the Ilouso by srenker. After the appointment of the usual committee to wait upon the Preslden the House adjourned out of respect to the memory of deceased members. No bills were Introduced In tho Sen ate to-clny. In the House there were 3S public measures anil .1j0 of a prlvat character. 

SEVEN CABINET CHANGES. I'misnnlly Importnnl Nonilnnllons Sen to ihr Senate liy the President Washington, Dec. 3,--Seven cabinet changes nnd onr appointment to tho supreme court bench wore sent to tho Sniite to-day by President Roosevelt but they wero not confirmed Immed iately In accordance with general cus toms concerning such Important nom inations. It Is said that there is no opposition to tho appointees for tho ablnet and to the nomination of Attor ney-General WUIInm II. Moody to bo associate Justlco of the supreme court, despite the fact that It was determined to refer these nominations to commit tees for report. Heretofore, tho com mittees have been polled on the floor of the Senate In executive session on cabinet appointments nnd out of court esy to the President immediately con firmed. The reason advanced for the change In the programme is thnt no message of nny character had been re ceived from tho President and there fore It would not bo proper to trans- nct- business.
