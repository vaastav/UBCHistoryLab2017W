The Presidents message was read be fore both houses of Congress on Tuesday Its great length may be judged from the fact of the reading occupying one hoar and forty two minutes. The subjects dis cussed cover a wide range, but the mes sage as a whole does not seem to hare ex cited any unusual interest in either house Viewed from a partisan standpoint, John Sharp Williams, democratic leader iti the House, styles the good part not new, while the new part is not good. By re publican leaders it is styled as an able and interesting document. The President presents no real plan for currency reform, but suggests law to pro vide a more elastic system of currency, and authorizing emergency issues to be based on adequate securities and issued under heavy tax. Trust legislation is discussed at great est length, and more Federal control of railroads and all other great corporations urged. Following the recommendations of the Postmaster general the establishment of postal savings banks, and extension of parcels post system is favored. In regard to the Panama canal Mr. Roosevelt ius'sts that the government should continue the work of construction under army en gineers. " One of the radical suggestions is the suppression of campaign contributions by corporations, and the appropriation by the Government to the national com mittees of each party enough money to conduct Presidental campaigns. The big stick policy crops up with a demand for an increase of the army and navy, and the strengthening of coast defenses. Among other important re commendations in the lengthy document are the improvement of inland water ways, irrigation and drainage; protection of forests and the public lands; conser vation of mining rights on public lands; limitation of exercise of injunction by Federal courts; compulsory arbitration of disputes between capital and labor; &c., &c. How about the “gold standard” and “the best banking system on earth” now ? Do you remember the bowl that went up from the bankers when the greenhackers and populist farmers wanted the Govern ment to issue paper money ? Do you remember with what ridicule and scorn the baukers scouted loug-haired reform ers and talked of the necessity of “honest money”? And now these same bankers are making “fiat money” out of theii checks to give out in lieu of the alleged honest money which their depositors left with them for safety. Reiuertiber what a lot they had to say about 53 ceut silver dollars ? But what about the no-cent dollars they are resort ing to at the present Time ? Are the people being cautioned against them and are the capitalistic dailies pratiug about the “honest do lar” and a “safe and sane<* policy, while the Wall Street stock jobbersYind gamblers are dipping into the United States Treasury to help themselves out of a panic of their own making ? Just do a little thinking about these things for yourself now. The Populists have issued their call for a National convention, to nominate a candidate for President. The convention will meet in St. Louis April 2, 1908. The call declares if the power of monopoly and privilege is to be taken from the banks and stockjobbers and the rule of the people restored in our time, it is to be accomplished through an independent party, free from predatory affiliations, a both Democratic and Republican parties i have entangling alliauces with the en emies of the government, and canuot make substantial progress for reform in this generation. The Sixtieth Congress of the United States opened on Monday. Both Houses are reported to have been in a snarly mood, with the presiding officers as the object of their attack, the minority mem hers of the House objecting to the adop lion of Seakers Cannon's rules, while vice President Fairbanks was assailed for what was considered a violation of senatorial ethics in the opening proceedings Twenty nine new Senators took the oath of office, while in Ibe House 102 new members took thier seats. Swarthmore College will, iu all prob ability, reject the bequest of Anna T. Jtanes, estimated to he worth 

SI,OOOOOO, the acceptance of which would require the institution to cease to participate in inter collegiate sports. WASHINGTON LETTER. Senator Allison, chairman of the finance committee of the Senate, drifted into town this week and discussed the outlook for currency legislation. Oh yes, of course, he said, there would be currency legislation, but not immediate. There were a number of plans to be con sidered, and it might be some time before the combined wisdom of the party made itself manifest in a perfect hill that could be subscribed to by all interests in the party and passed as an administration measure. That gives the keynote to the situation. The majority party wants to draw a bill and pass it as n party meas ure, claiming all the credit for it without respect to whether the country is waiting and needing legislation or not. There are about as many minds as to just what is needed in the way of a cur rency bill as there are men iu both bouses of Congress. There are all sorts of measures, from free silver to green backism. But there are about four pos sible solutions of the problem that will be seriously considered. Indeed whether any one of them is really a solution is a question that time alone can determine There is a proposition for a central bank of issue, more or less on the plan of the bank of England or the Imperial Bank of Germany. TBere is another scheme, less intimately associated with the gov ernment, of an organization among the existing banks with a sort of general clearing house and bank with supervisory powers. Then there is the scheme for largely increased note issue based on securities other than government bonds, and finally a scheme for note issue based on the assets of the banks with a govern ment guarantee behind it. Probably none of these schemes will be adopted outright. Each of them is a definite plan and any of them might work more or less well. But there are a number of “lead ers” who will want to have a finger in the pie of final settlement, and it is easy to see now that the ultimate hill will be a compromise measure, trimmed to suit various interests and to satisfy individual and personal vanities. In the end the measure probably will be neither fish, flesh or fowl, ami the only thing assured, if there be legislation at all, is that it will be a party measure in the worst sense of the term. It is wished by the party managers that the bill may be framed in committee and brought to the House and Senate ready to be jammed through under the party whip. That is the only way that it ever will get through, and thej-e probably will be a lively fight over it even Ihtn. It is quite as likely that the bill will he endlessly amended on the floor of the House and Senate, bandied back between conference aud floor, ami possibly in the end talked to death, end ing np the session unpassed under the warning of tile leaders against “hasty and ill considered legislation.” * * * There is another record breaking re port of wireless achievement on the Pa cific. The western ocean seems for some reason to be better adapted to long dis tauce wireless work than the Atlantic. There i 9 no particular explanation of why this should be but there are so many things about wireless telegraphy still unexplained that perhaps this 19 nst remarkable. The fact remains that one of the naval vessels when about 1,400 miles off San Francisco was in communi cation not only with San Francisco hut picked up a wireless message from Sitka. This was distant 2,200 miles air line, making a record for wireless communi , cation. * * * The War Department is going in for dirigible balloons at once without waiting for next spring. Army officers have been iletailed to watch the tests of a new motor in which the Department is interested. Without saying just what the motor is, * it may be said that it has been brought ' down in weight to four pounds to the horse power for the larger sizes. It is the most powerful motor of its weight that the Department has been able to 6ml in this country, aud several of them have been ordered for the several airships ; that will soou be under construction. A 1 ship built by the private firm that man ufactures the motor was tried out the 1 other day iu the presence of some repre sentatives of the War Department. It was something of a departure in the line of dirigible balloons. It used the gas bag to lift the bulk of the weight of the ship, but was slightly heavier than air wbeu fully loaded and depended on the : thrust of its propellers for part of its 1 bouyaucy, as well as for its driving power. It made an ascent of several hours' duration; attained an altitude of r,Boo feet and made in still air, a speed of 30 miles an hour. The trial was very satisfactory and a number of the features will be in corporated in the balloons that the De partment is preparing to build. * * Another step has been taken in the fight with the Tobacco Trust in the case of the |7,200 worth of cigarettes that were recently seized at Norfolk. The Trust after putting up adequate bond was flow ed to ship the cigarettes abroad. They were intended for the trade supplied by the Britisb-American Tobacco Company and were originally seized under the claim of the government that it had a right to levy on trust goods in interstate or foreign commerce. The question of law has not yet been fought out and it probably will be a long time before the case comes to a settlement which must eventually be before the United States Supreme Court. Meanwhile the Trust is free to ship its good abroad, giving bond to cover the amount if any more of them should be seized. * * , * There was an interesting visitor at the White House this week in the person of old Ezra Meeker, one of the pioneers of the northwest who has been for almost two years engaged in a jonrney from Tacoma, Wash., to the White House in a prarie schooner drawn by oxen. He is interested in a trans continental road fiom the Atlantic to the Pacific to be known as the Pioneer Way in memory of the man with the ox and wagon trains who opened up the west to settlement. Ezra drove up to the White House in bis ox drawn wagon and was introduced to the President by Representative Cushman of Washington. The President walked out bareheaded in the cold wind and looked over the team and was introduced to the hired man and the oxen. He ex pressed himself as much interested in the plau for a great inter ocean railway, but there is a serious question whether the scheme will become anything more than a scheme for many years to come. Panics. The Springfield, Mass , Republican, makes the following comments on this subject, which is occupying the public attention at present : ‘"‘Some lessons of value therefore are to be learned, and auioug them are these: The belief has been deeply cultivated that a money system strongly testing ou gold makes panics impossible It is a false notion. The belief has bad wide accept ance that a high protective tariff protects from panics which come only under low tariffs. That is quite as false as the other The belief prevails to 3 greater or less extent that a particular political party possesses the exclusive power of govern ing the country in freedom from financial disaster and industrial relapses. That is even more false than either of the other beliefs. Panics or financial crises are made possible only by the existence of the credit system, and the credit system exists under the gold standard as under any other money standard, and it is in operation whether tariffs are high or low, or whether the republican party is.in power or not.” The Jamestown ter-centennial closed on Saturday at Norfolk. The total at tendance figures arrf given as 2,800,000, of which 1,500,000 were paid admissions, hike almost every other big exhibition of its kind, it was far from a success financially. Receivers may be asked to keep the Exhibition intact and in read iuess for another year on a prospective sale as a whole of all the property. Maryland’s fruit exhibit was sent to Baltimore fdr exhibition there. Those of other States will be sold or given away. A Real Wonderland. South Dakota, with its rich silver mines, bonanza farms, wide ranges and strange natural forma tions, is a veritable wonderland. At Mound City, in the home of Mrs. B. D. Clapp, a wonderful case of healing has lately occurred. Her son seemed near death with lung and throat trouble. “Ex hausting coughing spells occurred every live minutes,” writes Mrs. Clapp, “when I began giving Dr. Kng’s New Discovery, the great meidicine, that saved his lite and completely cured him.” Guaran teed for coughs and colds, throat and luug troubles, by Eli T.
