The King of Sweden and Norway has accept ed the Joint' Invitation, or the" ,-< United' States. Germany and Great Britain' to arbitrate claims growing out of losses sustained in the Samoa n lalands In the course of .military operations made necessary by the disturbances in 1S33.< A bill Is now pendlmr to. effect the. recom mendation made In ' my ' last annual message that appropriate' legislation be 'had to carry Into execution article VIII of the: treaty, of peace with Spain, by. which the United States assumed the payment, of certain claims for in demnity of Its citizens aralnst Spain.' I ask that action be taken to fulfill this obligation. By the terms of the treaty of peace the line bounding the ceded' Philippines group in tho southwest failed to Include several small islands lying- west of the Bulus, which have always been recognized ag under Spanish con trol. The occupation of Slbutu and Cagayan by our naval forces elicited a claim on the part of Spain, the . essential equity of which could not be gainsaid: In order to cure the defect of the treaty by removing all possi ble ground of future misunderstanding. respect- Ing the Interpretation of IU third article, I li rected -the- negotiation of a supplementary treaty, which win be forthwith laid before the Penate. whereby Spain quits all title and claim of title to the Islands named as well as to any and all Islands belonging to the Philippine archipelago lying -outsldt! the lines described In said third article,' and agrees that all sucli Inlands shall be comprehended In the, cession of"the archipelago as fully as If. they had been expressly included within those lines, in con sideration of this cession,' the" United States is to pay Spain the sum of $100,000. • growing out of the seizure of the Delagoa Bay railway, has been at last determined by a fa vorable award of the tribunal of arbitration at Berne, to which it was submitted. The amount of the award, which was deposited In London awaiting arrangements by the Govern ments of the United States and Great Britain for its disposal, has been recently paid over to the two Governments. - ¦ » A lately signed convention of extradition with Peru as amended by the Benate has been ratified by the Peruvian Congress. 1 Another illustration of -the. policy of this . Government to refer international disputes to Impartial' arbitration Is eeen In the agreement reached with Bussia to -submit the claims on behalf of American sealing vessels seized in Bering Sea to determination by • T. II. C. Asser, a distinguished stateiman and Jurist of The Netherlands. : Thanks are due to the Imperial Russian Gov ernment for I kindly aid rendered by Its au thorities in Eastern Siberia to American mis sionaries fleeing from Manchuria. AT PEACE WITH SPAIN. Satisfactory progress has been made toward the conclusion of a .general treaty, of friend ship and Intercourse with Spain In replacement of the old treaty, which passed Into abeyance by reason of the late. war. A new convention of extradition Is approaching completion and I should be much pleased were a commercial ar rangement to follow. I feel that woshould not suffer to pass an opportunity to reaffirm the cordial ties that existed between us and Spain from the time of our .earliest Independence, and to enhance the mutual benefits of that commercial .Intercourse which is natural be tween the two countries. "A» long aa the insurrection continues th# military arm must necessarily be supreme. But there is no reason why steps shoull not b# taken from time to time to Inaugurate govern ments essentially popular In form as fast as territory is held and controlled by our troops. To this end I am considering the advisability of the return of the commission, or such of the merrtbers thereof as can be secured, to aid th* existing authorities and facilitate this work throughout the Island:*. "To give effect to the Intention thus expressed. I have appointed Hon. William H. Taft of Ohio. Professor Dean C. Worcester of Michigan. Hon. I,uke E. Wright of Tennessee. Hon. Henry C. Ide of Vermont, and Professor Bernard Moses of California, commissioners to the Philippine Islands, to continue and perfect the work of organizing and establishing civil government already commenced by the military authorUlen. subject In all respects to any laws which Con gre«s may hereafter enact. ¦ "The commissioners named will «n«et »"<* *ct as a board, and the Hon. William H Taft • designated ai chairman of th« board. It la probable that th« transfer ot authority from military commanders to cItU officers will b« irradual and will occupy a considerable period. Its successful accomplishment and the main tenance of peace and order In tha meantime will require tha most perfect co-operation between the civil and military authorities In the islands, and both should be directed during the transi tion period by the same executive department. The commission will therefore report to tha Secretary of War. and all their actions will be subject to your approval and control. "You will Instruct the commission to proceed tn the city ot Manila, where they will make their principal office, and to. communicate with the military Governor of the Philippine Island* whom you will at the same, time direct to ren der to them every assistance within his power in' the performance of their duties. Without hampering them by too specific Instructions. In the message transmitted to the Consrers on the 5th of December. 1899. I said, speaking of the Philippine Islands: By the spring of this year the effective op position of the dissatisfied Tagals tr> the author it} of the United States was virtually ended, thus opening the door for the extension of a stable administration over much of the terri tory of the archipelago. Desiring to fcrtna; this about. I appointed in March last a civil com mission composed of the Hon. William U. Taft of Ohio, Professor Dean C. Worcester of Mich igan. Hon. Luke E. Wright of Tennessee, Hon. Henry C. Ide of Vermont, and Professor Ber nard Moses of California. The aims of their mission and the scope of the'.r authority are clearly set forth in Instruction* of April T, 1900, addressed to the Secretary of War. to b« transmitted to them. still sufficient to beget insecurity ajnonf the populations that have felt the good results of our control and thus delay the conferment upon them of the falter measures of local self government,' of education and of industrial and agricultural development which we stand ready to give to them. r!on for exchange of trlrnflly congratulations with th» German Empercr. Our friendly relations with Great Britsin continue. The war in Southern Africa lntro <iuc-e<l important questions.

TEE ALASKAN BOUNDARY. The work of marking certain provisional r^urySary rolntt for convenience of adminis tration, around the head cf Lynn Canal, in 4:. enrtjacce tilth the temporary arranarement of October. I?**, was completed by a joint survey In July last. The modus vivendi has »o far ¦worked without friction and the Dominion Oovc-rriTnent has provided rules and regulatt jn* 'or fecurine to cur citizens the benefit of re- clproral ftirmlsticn that the citizens or fub- Jeots of either power f >".nd by that arrange ment within the temporary Jurisdiction of the other shall rafter no diminution of the rights end privileges they have hitherto enjoyed.

I renew the urgent recommendations I made !».« year Ihst the Congress appropriately -onfer Hpoa the Federal rourts Jurisdiction In ihls f isFfr of International cases where the ultimate ft*pcmslblllty of the Federal Government may be involved, and I Invite action upon the bills to acromplifh this which were Introduced In ' the (Senate and Hou?e. It is Incumbent upon us . to remedy the statutory omission which has led. and may lead again, to such untoward results. I have pointed out the necessity and the prece dent for legislation of this character. Its. enact ment is a simple measure of previsory Justice toward the nations with which we as a sover eign equal make treaties requiring reciprocal observance. While the Italian Government naturally re rsrds such action as the primary and. indeed, the most ersentUl element in the disposal of the Tatlulah incident. I advise that, in accord ance with precedent, and in view of the im r-rcbal>ility of that particular case being rer.ehed by the bill now pending. Congress n:eke gracious provision for indemnity to the Italian eufferers in the same form and propor tion as heretofore. In my inaugural address I nierred to the general subject of lynching tn tLcse words: "Lynching must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States; a i;rts. not mobs, must execute the penalties of the law. The preservation of public order, the right of discussion, the integrity of courts, and. the orderly administration, of justice must con tinue forever the rock of safety upon which cur Government securely rests." This I must urgently reiterate and again in vite the attention of my countrymen to this re rtoach upon our civilization. DEVELOPMENT OF JAPAN. The closing year has witnessed a decided strengthening of Japan's relations to other states. The development of her independent Judicial and administrative functions und-r the treaties which took effect July 17, 1$99, has pro ceeded without international friction, showing the competence of the Japanese to hold a fore most place among the modern peoples. In the treatment of the difficult Chinese problem, Japan has acted In harmonious i.on ctrt with the other powers, and her generous cr -operation materially aided In the Joint re lief of the beleaguered legations in Peking and in bringing about an understanding prelimin ary to a settlement of the issues between the powers and China. Japan's ' declarations In favor of the Integrity of the Chinese empire and the conservation of open-world trade there with have been frank and positive. As a factor for promoting the general intercuts of peace, crder and fair commerce in the far East, the influence of Japan can hardly be overestimated. The valuable aid and kindly courtesies extend ed by the Japanese Government and naval offi cers to the battleship Oregon are gratefully appreciated. Complaint was made last summer of the dis criminatory enforcement of. a bubonic quaran tine against Japanese on the Pacific Coast and of Interference with their travel in. California ,and Colorado under the health laws of those 'states. The latter restrictions have been ad judged by a Federal court to be unconstitution al No recurrence of either cause of complaint Is apprehended. • ' ' • No noteworthy Incident has occurred In our rt-latlons with our Important southern neigh bors. Commercial Intercourse with Mexico con tinues to thrive and the two Governments neg lect no opportunity to foeter their mutual In terests in all practicable ways. ' Pursuant, to the declaration of the Supreme Court that the awards of the late joint com mission in the La Abra ant} Well claims were obtained through fraud, the sum awarded In the first case, $402,030 OS, has been returned to Mexico, and the amount of the Well award will b* returned in like manner. A convention Indefinitely extending the 'time for the labor* of the United States and Mexi can International (water) Boundary Commis sion has been signed. HAGUE TREATY RATIFICATION. It Is with satisfaction that I am able u, an r.cunce the formal notification at The Hague, on September 4. of the depoclt of ratifications of the convention for the pacific settlement of thf international disputes by sixteen powers, namely, the United State*. Austria, Belgium, I>nmark. England. France, Germany, Italy, IVnrta. Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Stam, Pi-n'n, Sweden and Norway, and The Nether lrr.de. Japan has since ratified the convention. The administrative council of the permanent COUtt of arbitration has been organized and has adapted rules of order and a constitution for the International arbitration bureau. In ac cordance with- Article XXIII of the convention, piovidlng for the appointment by each signa tory power of persons of, known competency in q'lertlons of international . law as arbitrators, I have appointed as members ' of this court, Hon. Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, ex-Presl d<nt of the United States; Hon. * Melville W. Fuller of Illinois, Chief Justice of the United States: Hon. John W. Grins of New Jersey, Attorney-General of the' United States, and Hon. George Orsy of Delaware/a Judge of the Circuit Court of the United States. As an incident of the brief revolution tn the Mosquito District of Nicaragua, early in 1899, the Insurgents forcibly collected from Ameri can merchants duties upon imports. On the restoration of order the Nlcaraeuan authorities demanded a second payment of such duties on the ground that they were due to the titular Government, and that their diversion had aided the revolt. , . , ¦ .' This position was not accepted by us. After piolcnged dlecuaslon a compromise was effected, ux.der which the amount of the second fc>ay- "It Is apparent that uniformity of legisla tion upon this- subject in toe several States Is much to be desired. If Is u> be hoped that such uniformity, founded in a wise and Just discrimination between what Is Injurious and what Is useful and necessary In business oper ations, may be obtained, and that means may be found for Congress, within the limitations of its constitutional power, so to supplement an effective , code of State legislation as to make a complete system of laws throughout the United States adequate to compel a gen eral observance of the. salutary rules to which I have referred." ' _: . : The whole question Is'so Important and far reachlng that I am sure no part of It will be In my latt annual message to Congress I called attention to the necessity for early ac tion to remedy such evils as might be found to exist In connection with combinations of capital organized Into trusts and again invite attention to my discussion of the subject at that time, which concluded with th?se words: COMBINATIONS AND TRUSTS. The attention of Congress Is invited to the recommendation of tlw Secretary of the Treas ury In his annual report for legislation In behalf of the revenue cutter service and favor able action is urged. I recommend that the Congress at Its pres ent session reduce the Internal revenue taxes Imposed to meet the expenses of the war with Spain in the ouirt of *30.0no,000. This reduction should be secured by the remission of those taxes which expedience has shown to.be the most burdensome to the industries of the peo- P I especially urge that . there be Included In whatever reduction Is made the legacy tax on bequests for public uses of a literary, educa tional or charitable character. American vessels during the past three years have carried about 9 per cent of our exports and Imports. Foreign shipa should carry the least not the greatest part of American trade. The remarkable growth of our, steel Indus tries, the progress of shipbuilding for the do mestic trade and our steadily maintained ex penditures for the navy have created an oppor tunity to place the United States in the first rank of commercial maritime powers. Besides realizing a proper national aspiration, this will mean the establishment and healthy growth along all our coasts of a distinctive na tional industry, expanding the field for profit able employment of labor and capital. It will increase the transporatlon facilities and reduce freight charges on the vast volume of products brought from the Interior to the seaboard for export, and will strengthen an arm of the na tional defense upon which the founders of the Government and their successors have relied. In again urging Immediate action by Con gress on measures to promote American ship ping and fn-elgn trade. I direct attention to the recommendations on the subject In pre vious messages, ,and particularly to the opinion expressed in the message of 1899:, "I am satisfied the Judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to our merchant ma rine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuild our Bea->carryln* capacity for the products of agriculture and manufac ture, which, with the increase of. our navy, mean more work and wages j to our country men as well as a safeguard to American Inter ests In every part of the word." The Imports for the year amounted to $«43. 941.1S4, an Increase over 1899 of $152,792,633. This Increase is largely In materials for manufac ture, and Is In response to the rapid develop ment of manufacturing in the United States. While there was imported for use in manufac tures In 1900 material to the value of $79,768,973 in excess of 1S89, It is reassuring to observe that there is a tendency toward decrease in the importation of articles manufactured ready for consumption, winch in 1900 formed 15.17 per cent of the total Imports, asalnst 15.54 per cent in 1S99, and 21.G9 per cent in 1S96. . Agricultural products were also exported dur ing 1900 in greater volume than In 1953. the total for the year being $835,858,123, against $784,776, 142 in 1S99. Our foreign trade shows a remarkable record of commercial . and Industrial progress. The total of Imports and exports for the first' tlm<? in the history of our country exceeded two billions of dollars. The exports are greater than they have ever been berore, the total for the fiscal year 1900 being $1,394,483,082, an In crease over 1899 of $167,459,780. an 'increase over 1S98 of .$163,000,732, over 1S97 of $343,459,526 and greater than 1836 by $311,876,144. The growth of manufactures In the United States is evidenced by the fact that exports of manufactured products largely exceed those of any previous year, their value for 1900 being $433,851,756. against $339,592,146 in "1899, an in crease of 28 per cent. " The party in power is committed to such leg islation as will better make the currency re sponsive to the varying needs of business, at all seasons and In all sections. ¦• '* • A large Increase in national bank circula tion haa resulted from the provisions of the act which permits national banks to Issue cir culating notes to the par value of the United States bonds deposited aa security, instead of only 90 per cent thereof, as heretofore.* The increase In circulating notes from March 14 to November 30 is $77,899,570. The 'important matter of an interoceanic canal has assumed a new phase. Adhering to Its lefusal to reopen the question of the forfeiture of the contract of the Maritime Canal Com pany, which was terminated for alleged non execution in October, 1>>99, the Government ot Nicaragua has since supplemented that ac tion by- declaring the so-Ptyled Eyre-Cragin option void for .nan-payment of the stipulated ; advance. Protests In relation to these act? j have been filed In the State Department and are under consideration. Deeming Itself re lieved from existing engagements, the Nicara guan Government shows a disposition to deal freely with the canal question either in the way of negotiations with the United States or by taking measures to promote the waterway. Overtures for a convention to effect the i building of a canal under the auspices of the j United States are under consideration. In the ¦ meantime the views of Congress upon the sub ! Ject. in the light of the report of the committee appointed to examine the comparative merits of the various trans-lsthmlan ship canal projecta, may be awaited. I commend to the early attention of the Sen. ate the convention with Great Britain to facili tate the ¦ construction of such a canal and to i remove any objection which might arise out of j the convention commonly called the Clayton j Bulwer treaty. j' The long standing contention with Portugal, mt-nts was deposited with the British Consul at San Juan del Norte. In trust until the two Governments should determine whether the first payments had been made under compulsion to a "de facto" authority. Agreement as to this was not reached, and the point was waived by the act of the Nicaraguan Government In re questing the British Consul to return the de pesits to the merchants. Menacing differences between several of the Central American States have been accommo dated, our Ministers rendering good offices towcrd an understanding. Progress In the hoped-for direction has been favorable. Our forces have successfully con trolled the greater part of the islands, over coming the organized forces of the insurgents and carrying order and administrative regu larity to all quarters. What opposition remains Is for the moot part scattered, obeying no con certed plan of strategic action, operating only by the methods common to the traditions of guerrilla warfare, which, while ineffective to alter the general control now established, are In my last annual message I dwelt at soxna length upon the condition of affairs la the Philippine*. While seeking to Impress upon you that the grave responsibility of the future government of those islands rests with th« Congress of the United States, I abstained from recommending at that time a specific and final form of government for the territory actually held by the United States forces and in which as Ions as Insurrection continues the military arm must necessarily be supremo. I stated my purpose, until Congress ' ¦hall have made known the formal expression of ita will, to use the authority Tested in me by the con stitution and the statutes to uphold tb« Sov ereignty of the United States in these dis tant islands as in all other places where our flatr rightfully floats, placing, to that end, at the disposal of the army and navy all the means which the liberality of Congress and the people have provided. No contrary expres sion of the •will of -Congress having been made I- have stead f astir pursued the purpose ao de clared, employing the civil arm as well toward the accomplishment of pacification and. the In stitution of local governments within the linn of authority and law. Restraint upon such combinations aa ar« in jurious and which are within Federal Jurisdic tion, should b« promptly applied by Congress. lightly considered, but every phase of It will hav* the studied deliberation of Congress, re sulting in wise and judicious action. It is -worthy of . mention that . the greater number of. banks being organized under the new law are In; sections where the need of banking facilities has been most . pronounced. Iowa > stands first . with '.. thirty banks of . the smaller class, while Texas, • Oklahoma, Indian Territory .and the Middle Western' sections of the country hav» also availed • themselves largely of. the. privileges under, the new law. ORGANIZATION OF BANKS. Another effect of the operation, as stated by the Secretary, is to reduce the charge upon the . treasury for the payment of interest from the dates of refunding to February 1, 1901, by the sum of more than $7,000,000 annually. From February 1. 1904, to July 1, 1907, the an nual Interest charge will be reduced by the sum of more'than $5.00*. 000. and for ihe thir teen months ending August 1. 1908, by about $1,000,000. The full details of the refunding are given in the annual! report of the Secre tary of the Treasury. The . beneficial effect of the financial act of 1900. as far as it relates to the modification of the national banking act, is already apparent. The provisions for the Incorporation of national banks with a capltalof not less than $25,000 in places not exceeding 3000 Inhabitants has re sulted [ in the extension of banking facilities to many small . communities, hltljerto unable to provide j themselves with banking Institu tions under 'the national system. There were organised from the enactment of the law up to and Including November 30..3S9 national banks, of which 26« were with capital leea than $50,000. and 103 with capital of .$50,000 or more. _ • . | The law of March 14, 1900, provides for re funding into 2 per. cent thirty-year bonds, payable, principal and ' interest,' In gold coin of the present standard value, that portion of the public debt represented by the '3 per cent bonds of 1908, the 4 per cents of 1907 and the 5 per cents of 1904, of which there were out standing at the date of said law $839,149,930. The hojders of . the old bonds presented them for exchange between March 14 and November 30 to the amount of $361,943,750. The net saving to the Government on these transactions ag gregates $9,106,166. It will be the duty, as I am sure It will b« th« disposition, of the Congress to provide whatever further legislation is needed to In sure the continued parity, under all conditions, between our two forms of metallic money, sil ver and gold. . Our surplus revenues have permitted the SecretaryNof the Treasury slnee the close of the fiscal year to call In the funded loan of 1891, continued at 2 per cent. In the sum of $25,361,800. To and including November 30, $23,458,100 of these bonds have been paid. This sum, together with the amount ¦ ' which may accrue from further redemptions under the call, will be applied to the sinking fund. and bullion, held for the redemption of United Slates notes. If this form were, pursued, the cush balance, including the present gold re serve of $150,000,000. would be $289,303. 794 50. Such balance November 30, 1899, was $396,495, 301 5T>. In the general fund, which Is wholly separate from the reserve and trust funds, there was on November 30. $70,090,073 15 in gold coin and bullion, to which should be added $22,957, 300 In gold certificates subject to issue, against v/hlch there Is held in the division of redemp tion gold coin and bullion, making a total hold- Ing of free gold amounting to $33,047,373 15. Because of the excess of revenues over expen ditures, the Secretary of the Treasury was en abled to apply bonds and other securities to the sinking fund to the amount of $56,544,556 06. The details of the sinking fund are set forth l.i the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which I Invite attention. The Secretary of the Treasury estimates that the receipts for the current fiscal year will aggregate $380,000,000, and the expenditures $000,000,000, leaving an ex cess of revenues over expenditures of $SO,000,000. The present condition of the treasury Is one of undoubted strength. The available cash bal ance November 30 was $139,303,794 50. Under the form of statement prior to the financial law of March 14 last, this would have been included In the statement of available cash, gold coin It Is gratifying .also to note that during the year a considerable reduction is shown In the expenditures of the Government. The "War De partment expenditures for the fiscal year 1900 were $134,774,767 78, a reduction of $93,06G,4S« 69 over those of 1S99. In the Navy Department the expenditures were $55,953,077 72 for the year 1900. as against $63,942,104 25 for the preceding year, a decrease of $7,983,026 53. In the expenditures on account of Indians there was a decrease In 1900 over 1899 of $2,630,604 3S; and In the civil and miscellaneous expenses for 1900 there was a reduction Of $13,418,065 74. '-. i ¦•-.-¦"- 

REVENUES RAPIDLY INCREASE. of which from 1894 to 1839, inclusive, amounted to J2S3.022.991 14. The receipts for the year from all sources, exclusive of postal revenues, aggre gated $567,240,851 89, and expenses for all pur poses, except for the 'administration of the postal department, aggregated $487,713,791 71. Ihe receipts from customs were $233,164,871 16, an increase over the preceding year of $27,036, 3i3 41. Receipts from internal revenue were $2?5,327,826 78, an increase of $21,890,7«5 25 over 1539.

Including meny from our diplomatic representatives, have to a considerable extent pointed out ways and means of disposing of a great variety of manu factured goods which otherwise might not have found sale abroad. Testimony of foreign observer* to the com mercial efficiency of the consular corps seema to be conclusive, and our own manufacturers and exporters highly appreciate the value of the services rendered, not only In the printed reports, but also l In the individual efforts of consular officers to promote American trade. An increasing part of (he work of the Bureau ot Foreign Commerce, j whose primary duty it is. to compile and print the reports, is to an swer inquiries : : from trade organizations, Lusl ness houses, etc., as to conditions in various parts of the world, : and, notwithstanding the sniallness of the force employed,, the, work has been so systematized that responses are made with such promptitude and accuracy a* to elicit lettering encomiums. .; The experiment of print- Ing the consular reports dally for immediate use! by trade bodies, exporters and the press, which was begun in January, 1898/ continues to givegeneral satisfaction. . . UTILITY OF CONSULS. The bureau of the American Republics contin ues to discharge, with the happiest results, the important work of promoting the cordial rela tions between the United States and the Latin- American countries, all of which are now act ive- members of the International union. The bureau has been instrumental in bringing about the agreement for another international Ameri can congress, which is to meet In the City oi Mexico in October, 1901. The bureau's futurt for another term of ten years Is assured by th« International compact, but the congress will doubtless have much to do with shaping new Hr.es of work and ft general policy. Its use fulness to the Interests of Latin- American trade Is widely appreciated and shows gratifying de velopment. • The exposition of the resources and products of the Western hemisphere to be held at Buf falo next year promises Important results, not only for the United , States, but for the other participating countries. It In gratifying that the Latin-American States have evinced the liveliest Interest, and the fact that an interna tional American congress will be held in the City of Mexico while the exposition Is in pro gress encourages the hope of a larger display at Buffalo than might otherwise be practicable. The work of preparing an exhibit of our na tional resources Is making satisfactory pro gress under the direction of different officials of the Federal Government, and the various Etntes of the Union have shown a disposition toward the most liberal participation in the enterprise. This Government deslrts to preserve the most Just and amicable commercial relations with all foreign countries, unmoved by the Industrial rivalries necessarily developed In the expan sion of international trade. It Is believed that the foreign Governments generally entertain the same purpose, though in some Instances there are clamorous demands upon them for legislation specifically hostile to American ln t< tests. Should those demands prevail. I shall communicate with the Congress with the view of advising such legislation as may be neces sary to meet the emergency. The policy of reciprocity so manifestly rests upon the principles of International equity and has been so repeatedly approved by the people of the United State*, that there ought to be no hesitation In either branch of the Congress In giving to it full effect. The failure of action by the Senate at its last session upon the commercial conventions then submitted for its consideration and approval, although caused by the great pressure of other legislative business, has caused much disap pointment to the agricultural and industrial interests of the country, which hoped to profit by their provisions. The conventional periods for their ratification having expired, it became necessary to sign additional articles extend ing the time for that purexjse. This was re quested on our part, and the other Governments Interested have concurred, with, the exception, of one convention, in * respect to . which no formal reply has been received. COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS. Slnee my : . last communication to Congress on this subject special commercial agreements under the third section of the. tariff act have been proclaimed with Portugal, with Italy and with Germany. Commercial conventions under the general limitations of the fourth section of the same act have been concluded with Nic aragua, with Ecuador, with tfie Dominican Re public, with Great Britain on behalf of tlvi island of Trinidad, and with Denmark on o* half of the island of St. Croix. These will be early communicated to the Senate. Negotia tions with other governments are In progress for the improvement and security of our com mercial relations. Our claims upon the Government of the Sul tan for reparation for injuries suffered by American citizens in Armenia and elsewher" Rive promise of early and satisfactory settle ment. His Majesty's good disposition in this regard has been evinced by the Issuance of an irade for rebuilding: the American college at Harpoot. CALL BUREAU. 14^>6 G STREET N. W.. WASHINGTON. Dec. 3 — Call representatives interviewed the California' Senators and mem bers of the House of Representa tives en the President's message nnd mat ters of importance pending in Congress and of special interest to the Pacific Coast. Senator Bard paid: "Ii if too early to predict what wii! be accomplished at this session; we only know what will he attempted. With four teen appropriation bills and the army re orpanization bill f> pass and or.ly three months in which to pass them, it is inevitable that a large *hare of ether attempted legislation must fail for lack of time. There will be an effort to bring the shipping bill to a vote as early as pcsFible. and It will j rohatly j-.a^s after being considerably emendfd. The Nicaragua car.al question will presumably have the next right of ¦way-. <"r>nsiii<rr»tif n of the Hay-P/tunce fote treaty will necessarily be complicated with the discussion of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. One point in connection wiih the !apt-nr.nred trenty which has not yet been <5isrurred is the fact that it specifically prohibits both England and the United States forever acquiring any territory or sovereignty in another part of Central 

LOUD ON LEGISLATION. Representative Loud said: "I always think it idle to discuss a President's message until it has been carefully read and thoroughly digested. I have not yet had time to do so, but from a casual examination of it will say it appears to be a thoroughly business-like document throughout. Just euch as we would expect from the President. As for bills pending In Congress will say I have no means of knowing whether the canal bill or ship subsidy bill will be passed at this session. I know that at the very first opportunity Senator Frye. chairman of the Committee on Commerce, will at tempt to sidetrack the canal bill by call ing up the ship subsidy bill. I have va rious measures to propose for California improvements, but as my bills are not yet perfected, I cannot, discuss them, at this time." Representatives Barn am and Waters have not yet arrived at Washington. building bill passes this season I believe I'll succeed. We want relief for the own ers of private property in our national parks, and increased appropriations M build roads and trails. The roads Into the Yosemite should be marie free from toll and a wagen road built up the Merced River. I sincerely hope we will begin the work of building storage reservoirs as this matter cannot be much longer post poned. This will be a busy session, but I think we will work and avoid necessity for an extra session." full and complete report Is made by that commission and the United States Su preme Court has determined the questions now pending before it in regard to our new possessions, it would be, to say the least, unwise to legislate concerning theso Islands. The President's message is a calm and dispassionate review of the finan cial. Industrial and commercial condition* of this country and of our relations with foreign countries. His recommendation for the construction of a cable between the United States and Hawaii, with ex tension to Manila, will receive the hearty indorsement of all Californians." 

KAHN PREDICTS RESULTS. Representative Kahn said: "Judging from the sentiments uttered by members of the House in the cloak rooms and lobbies to-day the present short session of Congress will be one of unusual activity. Of course, the regular appropriation bills will consume the usual amount of time, but there are, several questions of national importance. In which the Pacific Coast States are deeply interested, that will come up for early consideration. I was pleased to see that the President in his message so strongly advocates the construction of the trans-Pacific cable. No doubt that will have considerable influence in secur ing the passage of the Senate bill, which is now on the calendar and which will undoubtedly be called up for early con sideration. The Nicaragua canal bill will engage the attention of the Seaate next Monday, and the general impression seems to be that the House bill, with cer tain modifications, will pass the upper house. The army reorganization bill will be one. of the most Important measures considered, and will no doubt precipitate a rancorous debate. The apportionment bill is also going to provoke a struggle. but from present indications the number ? of members will not be materially in creased. The oleomargarine bill is the special order for Wednesday of this week. Much feeling has been engendered In the discussion of this measure, and no donbt the debate will provoke more or loss bit terness. Even shouloV this measure pass the House, It is doubtful whether it will obtain consideration In the Senate at this session. Then, of course, the bill for the reduction of the war tax is going to be a most important piece of legislation. Tho entire country seems to demand that tho tax be reduced, if not absolutely repealed, and should the committee report a bill exempting certain products ' or articles, documents or industries from the tax those not so favored will make a vigorous fight to get the advantage of the pro posed reduction. Altogether, the session promises to be most exciting, and many bills of purely local or private character will receive but scant recognition." 

WOODS IS HOPEFUL. Representative Woods said: "The message oi President McKinley v/as in keeping with his. late letter accept ing the nomination for the Presidency. It completely covered the great questions to come before Congress, was terse and de cisive, and such ns only a man of the largest understanding of America's posi tion at home and abroad and a statesman could have written. My first thought upon bearing It was that the American petjple should thank God that the election went as it did. There is a great deal to come ' before Congress at the present short ses sion, but I believe it will be able to carry everything through in a satisfactory man ner, as I do not look for dilatory tactics on the part of the minority. I believe that one of the measures passed will be a Nic aragua canal bill which will meet with the approval not only of the Pacific Coast, but of the whole United States. I made my campaign upon a personal belief in the widest possible expansion of American liberty and institutions/ and still adher" to this belief. I shall heartily favor Sena tor Frye's ship subsidy bill, the Nicaragua canal bill, and all of the recommendations contained in the President's message. An other thing which I heartily favor is a reduction of the war revenue tax to the smallest limit cpnsistent with our finan cial welfare. I shall persistently urge an appropriation of $300,C00 for the betterment of the Yuba river and its tributaries, to supplement the $5000 now unexpended in tho hands of the California Debris Com mission. I am a believer in a great Indus trial and commercial future for CaJifornia and in forwarding this the navigability of her interior waters is very important." 

WHAT NEEDHAM DESIRES. Representative Needham stated that he had not as yet had time to carefully read the President's message, but from the slight examination he had been able to give it, regarded it as a strong documen.., especially the portions dealing with th-? administration's course irf China. He sa'd he believed that the canal bill, the Pacific cable bill and an army reorganization bill and a bill reducing the taxes levied in the Avar revenue act would pass this session. A reapportlonment basis would be fixed and strong efforts would be put forth to pass the ship subsidy bill with good pros pects of success. "In regard to measures that particularly interest my district." he said. "I shall use my best efforts to get an adequate appropriation to improve San Diego harbor and 1 believe I'll succeed. If I don't get a lump sum I feel confident that this harbcr will be put under the continuing contract. I want to get a pub lic building at Fresno and if a public ready been expended In forts, guns, etc.. for the proper care of which, tha mini mum force of trained men necessary Js 1S.420. The President shows that for economical domestic purposes there must be an increase in the army, and recommends that Its perma nent force be placed at 60,000, with power . to Increase it to- 100.000- during the present conditions in Cuba and the Philippines, including 15,000 native troops in the latter islands. In my opinion, V.\<i President has placed this important ques tion in. a very strong light. The policy of the administration in respect to the Phil ippines is clearly set forth in hi3 instruc tions to the Taft Commission, and In them there can be found no fact on which to base a claim of danger from Imperial ism." 

METCALF SPEAKS PLAINLY. Representative Metcalf said: "It is impossible a*, this early date to state just what measures will receive the attention of Congress at this session, it is safe to say. however, that the general appropriation bills will receive immediate attention, and will take precedence over all other measures. A particularly strong effort will be made to secure the passage of a shipping bill to the end that Ameri can merchandise and croducts may be carried in American bottoms. The Nic.t ragua canal bill Is now before the Senate, and a strong effort wiil be made to secure its passage. The war revenue act will Vie amended, reducing the revenue derived under that act at least $30,000»000 a year. A bill will be Introduced and passed re organizing and Increasing the military force of the United States. A river and harbor bill will also be passed at this session. There will, in my opinion, be no legislation at this, session affectlnir the Philippine Islands. The Taft Commission as yet has made no report, and until a America. To abropate the treaty might remove the prohibition in England, while to confirm*? it will be to tie our own hands forever on a matter which may eventu ally become of vital importance. This is a question which ought to be cleared up before any irrevocable decision is made either to confirm or to endeavor honor ably to abrogate th§ Clayton-Bulwer treaty." SENATOR PERKINS' VIEWS. Senator Perkins said: "I think the President's message an ex cellent resume of the business conditions «if the country, foreign and domestic, and it sets forth in moM simple and convincing manner the flourishing state of our Indus tries from the growth of raw materials to the manufacture of finished products. These portion of the message show up very dearly and in businesslike form the remarkable prosperity of the Unite! States at present. It will be notice! the President di cs not refer with very great strei:pth to the Nicaragua canal. But this I attribute to the fact that the ITay- Paunoefote treaty, which has important provisions relative to such canal, has not been acted on by the Serrate. The Pres ident indorses the ship subsidy bill as tho only way to rehabilitate our merchant marine. In this I heartily concur, and find only one caiyse for criticism of the bill, which is that it admits foreign -built ships. My desire is that all vessels flyns the American flag be constructed here, fnless the Democrats should offer strenu ous obstruction. I thinU that the bill wlil become law. with perhaps a few amend ments. The reference of the President to t!:t s'tuaticn in which the army now is is most timely. He shows that under the. sujministration of President Cleveland, a. scheme of coast defense fortifications was devised which involves the outlay of over
