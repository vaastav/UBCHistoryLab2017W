This morniDg when Bruce en tered tue bakery to knead the flour for his bread, Hacker spraDg on him armed with a hatchet and a long knife. He struck Brace on the head with the hatchet. Then he crowded his victim against the wall and deliberately plnnged the dagger nine times into Bruce's neck and.*face. The victim cried <>nt for his wife,and the brave woman rushed into the room and clutched the blood bespattered Anarchist about the neck, dragging him away from her hus band just as he was lifting the hatchet to brain the helpless victim.

SUPREME COURT. Mormon Church Forfeiture Case Under Consideration. Washington, December 3.—In the Supreme Coart to-day Hon. F. S. Richards, of Salt Lake, made a motion for the ad vancement of the case of the United States vs. Mormon church for forfeiture and escheat of church property to the govern ment on appeal from a decree of the supreme court of Utah. After stating the claims of the government and of the ap pellants, the following reasons were given for the advancement of the cause : That it is a cause in which the United States is a party; that it involves the constitution ality of certain acts of Congress; that it affects not only the people of Utah, but the rights of church corporations of every denomination in the Territories, and is therefore a question of public interest; that a large amount of church property has been seized and is now held by a receiver, mach of it of a perishable nature, and thus liable to irreparable loss and damage if left till the case can come np m its order and the delay with its great expenses en tailed will amount to a virtual confisca tion of said property. That nearly half a million dollars of personal property had been thus seized, when there is no law or semblance of a law for the seizure of per sonal property. That part of the real es tate so seized has been held by said chnrch for over thirty-five years and before the act of 1862 passed limiting the amount of real estate to be held by church corpora tions, and that another part had been held as a parsonage and is exempted in the terms of law. For these and other reasons appellants ask an early hearing of the case. The counsel for the government of fered no objection. The Court took the matter under advisement.

TER-STA I E COMMERCE. , Annual Report of the Commissioners. Washington, November 30.— The an nual report of the Inter-Stare Commerce Commission is now in type and trom it the following iä taken: Fioin the best infor mation now available, the railroad mileage of the country on the 30th of June, 1888, wi s estimated at 152,781, of * hich 2.312 miles have been completed and brought into op eration within the six months preceding that day. The summary is made ol formal complaints of 107 cases submitted, titty of which have been decided, and six have not yet been decided; nine hearings not completed, twenty-three withdrawn or settled, ten suspended by request, nine assigned for hearing. The long and short haul in the section of country north of the Potomac and Ohio and east of the Mis souri, eases in which gieater charge is made for shorter transportation, are few and their circumstances are such that com plaint is not often made that they operate successfully. With some exceptions resulting from ocean competition, the rule of the short haul provision of the law has been put in force upon the transcontinental roads where its operation and effect can be observed under what now appears to be favorab ! e conditions. In the southern and southwestern States the commission has had reason to think the carriers were mov ing more slowly in bringing their traffics into conformity with the general statutory law than in other sections. Not be ing satisfied that this duty has been suffi ciently apprehended and observed the commission h»s ordered an investigation of the whole subject. The report then takes up the subject of the effect of the interstate act upon com mon carriers, and says: Although some railroad managers have declared it to have had a damaging effect, the commission is possessed of no evidence that the result has been other than beneficial. Railroad business has suffered the past year not be cause ot the interstate act, but owing to strikes, new parallel lines, and rate wars. With reference to the rate wars in the Northwt st and among the trank lines dar ing the year the report says : As is the common case in rate wars, the trunk line difficulties resulted from suspicion on the part of the carriers respectively that their competitors were cutting open rates, and reductions were made to recover freight which parties to the agreement claimed was their dne, but which they were not getting because of secret cutting by others. The efforts of the commission to obtain evidence of the practices suspected bave been wholly ineffective and the war of rates proceeds without a possibility of external authority interposing to bring it to an end. The making of unreasonably low rates, the repoit intimates, is often tor stock jobbing purposes or to compel the purchase ot a road by competing lines. Persons having control of railroads may deliberately make insufficient rates in ex pectation of the profits to be indirectly and improperly derived therefrom. In every case the war^may be regarded as one of this kind. The present profits are sac rificed on the calculation that by crippling a rival Jr by forcing an agreement or com promise on some matter of contention, the loss in time will be more than made up. In the majority of such cases the losses exceed the gains. The statute had not conferred upon the commission any power to order any increase of rates which it can see are not renumerative. In general, therefore, it may be said, railroad mana gers possess the power to destroy the in terests not only of their rivals, but of their own stockholders. They will recklessly make rates that lead to bankruptcy. The question often becomes of high moment whether it is wiser to meet the reduced rates ot a competitor or let the business go. Yet the decision of this ques tion is left by important lines in the bands of subordiDa'es whj apparently have no other notion upon the subject beyond the rule that every cut must be promptly met Nothing seems more surprising than the fact that the railroad manager will neitaer take steps by law to put a stop to secret cutting of rates, which he pub licly charges, or famish evidence upon which others may do so. He will, never theless, sacrifice for his shareholders mil lions of revenue to punish it. In the unity ot railroad interests, it is reasonable to ex pect that the carriers of the country will, where practical, make such joint arrange ments that the public shall find an ar rangement witn one adeqnate for the pur pose of any single transaction. There should be some means of enforcing among the earners obligation«, moral or legal, that would grow out of such arrangements. The tendency among railroads seems likely to be in the direction of consolidation as the only means of mutual protection against rate wars. Bnt anything equivalent to the creation of what is now denominated as trnsts conld hardly he supposed possible, even if the parties were at liberty to form at pleas ure. Lacking concentration of atbority, railroads can do mnch towards better relations with the public aod do better service by first establishing better relations among themselves. The need of this is very imperative. In all catting of rates the party beginning it makes charges or insinuations against its competitors. Car riers cutting rates have proclaimed that reduced rates were all that conld be justly demanded when persons of experience knew that a persistence in such ratee would lead directly to bankruptcy. An impartial observer is compelled to say that snch methods do not belong to the present age. While the commission is not at this time prepared to recommend general legislation towards the establish ment and promotion of relations between carriers that shall better serve public in terests than those which are now common, it mast nevertheless look forward to the poesibility of something of that natnre becoming at Borne time imperative nnlets a great improvement in existing conditions is voluntarily inaugurated. The immigrant tiausportation has been considered aud varions facts stated, which were developed upon two investigations held in New York City. In view of all circumstances, the Commission recom mend a reception place larger than Cas tle Garden, from which those not legiti mately connected with immigrant trans portation shall be excluded. The interior lilies should have agents there on an eqnal footing. The payment of commissions for roaring immigrants and for procuring the shipment of immigrants from foreign countries should be declared illegal and made punishable. The Commission should have power to fix immigrant fares. These objects cannot be fully accomplished except by the general government taking com plete control of the whole subject. The subject of capitalization is recog nized as exceedingly important, but it is believed it can only be bandied gradually and in detail. There are provisions against false billing, classification, weighing or report of weight, or unreasonable prefer ences or advantage. The commission be lieves the penal provisions against wrongs of this nature should embrace also the owner of the property or any party acting for the owner or consignor of the property, who shall be a party to any snch unlawful conduct. The commission 'suggest that the question thus raised be settled by an ex press provision. Another qaestion of con struction oaght also to be settled by legis lation in order to take away the pretense on which certain through lines are now claimed to be local in tact and through lines only in appearance The commission thinks that if a line is in fact a through line by reason ot ownership, the corpora tion controling it ought not tobe at liberty to make through rates or to make them at pleasure. The commission favor joint tariffs aüd through rates and recommends that carriers engaged independently in inter-state traffic on rivers, lakes and other navigable waters of the country he upon the same tooting with inter s:ate carriers by rail.

PRESIDENT-ELECT. Cabinet Gossip --- Grouse Hunting For To-morrow. Indianapolis, December 4. — About the only out-of-town caller of note upon the President-elect to-day was Gen. J. A. Williamson, of Iowa, ex commissioner of the general land office, who is en route to Boston. Speaking of Senator Allison's probable membership of the President elect's cabinet, the commissioner stated he was inclined to believe, afrer a long ac quaintance with the Iowa Senator, that he did dot care to leave the Senate at present. After Allison he felt confident that Clark son was the choice of Iowa Republicans. To-morrow, if the weather is pleasant, the President elect proposes to take a holi day and enjoy a little grouse shooting. A few days ago he recieved a handsome pres ent from Syracuse, N. Y., of a new patent double barrel bammerless shot gun. It is elegantly mounted in gold plate, and set in the stock is a small gold design, upon which his name is engraved and the words "protection to American industries." The party will leave to-morrow, over the In dianapolis, Decatur aud Springfield road. The car will be switched off at some small station and from that point they will make a circuit and scour the fields lor feathered game. IN THE
