J . - . E. D. AKE, Editor. VotTJME XXIIT. - NUMBEB 22. I RONTON, . ?. :.' : Dec.. 5, 1889. last; Monday morning, when Reed of of Maine, for speaker, as well as the Republican caucus nomiuees for the other positions.were duly elected. The President's message was presented and read Tuesday moruiog. It will be giv en in full in next week's Register. There is no denying the fact that President Harrison knew bis man when be selected Green B. Raum as the successor of Corporal Tanner. Raum is granting just as many pen sions as Tanner, but has discretion enough to keep his mouth closed in re gard to the matter. The present ad ministration is not too desirous that its acts be published to the criticising world. The idea that any other Democrat than Geo. G. Vest will succeed the Junior Senator at the expiration of his present term of office is fully as absurd as the statement announced by the Globe-Democrat that bis successor is likely to be a Republican. Geo. G Vest should be Missouri's Senator for lite, and when 'tis otherwise we hope to sea Democracy in the minority in this State. Farmington Times: "The Grand Jury, after a session of nearly two weeks, adjourned last Friday. They returned about 230 indictments, the largest number ever returned by any Grand Jury in this county. Of this number only about 50 were for viola tions of the local option law, when a thousand could probably have been found. Thebalarfceof the indictments with a few exceptions, were for shoot lag craps and minor oSenses." Bro. Cundiff, of the Farmington Democrat, at the late term of the St. Francois circuit court, was indicted for playing "craps," and paid fine and costs aggregating $14. He plead guil ty. But let not the laity lose faith in iu the piety of the country press: 'tis the exception proves the rule,rou know There are two surprises, however, in the above incident: not that Bro. C. played "craps," but that be was eo negligent as to be caught; not that he paid his tine for, all that a man bath will he give to keep out of jail but that he had the wherewithal for Caesar's tribute. A couple of weeks ago, thf following item appeared in the Scott County Newsboy: We understand that Frank Davis, of Hickory Grove, was out on a bunt during the late rains. lie claiais to have found bis bog scattered about in spots and intimates that somebody stole it. Since then, the editor of that paper has been Interviewed by Mr. Davis, who had been led to believe by his neighbors that the Newsboy bad been "slandering the whole community;" but on reading the item, he "couldn't see anything very bad iu it, except that it was true." Then a committee of prominent citizens called on the editor, and wanted to know "who authorized him to put it in?" The editor said, 'Nobody; put it in on my own respon sibility; isn't it true?" But the com mittee wasn't in the mood to answer impertinent questions, and the mem bers departed, regretting that the editor could find it in his heart to "publish such things as reflected upon the neigh borhood." Meantime.Mr.Davis doesn't kick; the editor doesn't give ad n the hog-meat hasn't been found; and we have no doubt tbe thief is enjoying the usufruct of his exploitation. It was one of the arguments used in favor of the adoption of the local option law that "it would settle the liquor question for four years," and the coni muuity would have a rest from agita tion, whatever else might result. A plausible assertion, but our sister coun ties who voted for the law, are exper iencing its untruth. All of theiu, with out exception, are being shaken from centre to circumfereuce with tbe strug gle between order and disorder, law and law-breaking. Time was when laws were made to enforce religious views and coerce piety. Their success wss not signal, but they tore up the community until they were repealed; and laws to create temperance (?) amongst the people, will similarly eventuate, so to speak. In the mean time, the law-breakers and the law officers are having a picnic upon tarts,' jams, creams, cakes, etc., furnished at tbe expense of the untutored but ad miring tax-payer. That tbe lawless ness is not all on tbe side of the gin slingers, th following, from the Farm ington Democrat, bears witness: A. Farkhurst, A. Retornaz and G. 31. Wil son, property owners who rent to the "rest aurant" men, received anonymous commun ications last week, warning them that unlets they put a stop to the business conducted by their renters their property would be blown up, or otherwise destroyed. Tbe contested election case from Sil ver Bow County, Mont., was pending in the Territorial Supreme Court wbeu the President unceremoniously wiped the court out or existence by proclaim ing the admission of Montana into the Union. This transferred tbe case to the State Supreme Court, which is Republican. We are not disposed to quarrel with tbe fortunes of war, and we presume the President had full warrant for what he did; bnt the fact that he Issued his proclamation when the official papers bad hardly Lad time to reach him from Helena, and an hour before a regular meeting of the Cabinet, has excited considerable com ment, and there Is a story going around that the President issued his proclama tion before be had received the evidence that Montana bad complied with the enabling act, in consequence of a dis patch from bis son warning him that if be did not act quickly tbe Democrat ic Supreme Court of the Territory would dispose of the Silver Bow case. It is a little suspicious that on Monday it was reported in Helena that Rnssell Harrison had beard that the procla mation would be issued on Tuesday or Wednesday, the local Republicans be ing extremely anxious to have it issued before the Territorial court could dis pose ot the election case, and the proc iaajation was Issued early Friday Morn ing. The Sauce for Democrats Only. "I have no charge to make against your military record or vour moral chacter. I deem it to tbe best interests of the service that men who have been rerated in the bureau should not con tinue there to exercise their influence in that direction, either by their pres ence or ny tneir counsel." So wrote Secretary Noble to Col. James E Smith, a Democrat in tbe Pension of fice who had been rerated, obtaining an aaamnri or $iu a montb to his pen sion without back pay. Col. JamcsE Smith therefore resigned. But the Second Deputy Commissioner, Gen Bartiett, being a Democrat, was also induced to resign, although he was not one of the rerated, while the First Deputy Commissioner, Hiram Smith being a Republican, is still retained in spite f the fact that he rerated himself and took $6,035 of Dack pay. There are twenty or thirty more Republican reraters in the bureau .notoneof whom baa received such a notice as was Berved on Col. James E. Smith. For tunately it is not in the power of the administration to deprive Democratic veterans of pensions as well as of offic ial positions. Post-Dispatch. Old Times. Ed. Register A few days ago.I rode over the mountains between home and Brewer's Creek, where I kept "batch hall" so many winters, and as I went wiuding along up tbe sides of the mountains and pist the places made interesting at some of my early hunts how fresh all tbe circumstances would come to mind. At one place would be here is where I shot at that panther.in tLe night, while Are hunting; over there I killed an old buck with such big head of horns; and rightover there is where Henry and I saw those eagles trying to catch those old gobblers, and where we each killed one; and, when I had reached the top of one of the high est mountains, where we used to -stop to look way east where we could see a farm, the only one for miles. And here on a clear day we could see tbe smoke rising from the lead furnaces at Mine La Motte and down there, at the foot of tbe mountain, for a mile or two, that valley lay spread out with not tree, but thickly covered with a tall mass of sage grass and a large weed that grew eight or ten feet high. And such bramble patches! How fresh one instance came up to my mind. It was In tbe early eprlner. as we were on our way home with our guns on our should era, we came to this spot. The wind was blowing very hard from the south. I said to Henry, "We read of the terri ble fires on the prairies; don't you think wrt could set fire to this grass and have a small prairie fire of our own?" He said, "I should like to see one once. Suppose we set fire to this grass, and see how It would look." I took out my punk and flint and steel and struck fire. In about two minutes we bad such a fire as I had never seen before. O. it was frightful! The wind blew and the fire roared, and swept every thing before it. No horse could have rnn fast enough to escape it and such clouds of smoke! Althogh we knew there was but one house between the fire and Farmington, sixteen miles away, yet there was a feeling of terror in our hearts. After the fire bad spent its force, and burned to tbe heavy tim ber, we resumed our march ovi-r the blackened ground. What a change a few minutes made in the appearance of the country! And now, as I looked from the top of the same mountain, and saw all this valley, and. as far as tbe eye could reach, farms spread out with orchards and all the accompaniments of houses, barns, cribs, and sheds, stacks, I could hardly realize where I was; and when 1 reached old Brewer's Creek, I passed by the hole of water where I got such a ducking on that cold Christmas d?.y so long ago. It almost made me shiver at tbe thought of it, and when, just before dark, I rode up to my friend's house aud hallooed to tbe house, my frieud came and opened the gate. "Come in." How good it seemed to sit down before a good log fire in one of those big fire-places once more, and right there the mother had an old- fashioned Dutch-oven, with a bed of coals under the oven and a bed of coals on tne top. ah ene, wnu iu uiu- fashioned pair of hooks, raised tbe cov er, how good and delicious those dodg ers did smell; and, when seated at the table, how good they tested well spread with butter and both covered with nice white honey comb, accompanied with a glass of good sweet milk. And after supper is over, and tbe family are all seated before and around the fire. I am asked to read. How they seem to drink in those interesting stories, and seem to never cret tired until war in the night. Some one Bays, "we had better adjourn until morning, for it is half past eleven o'clock." How sound we sleep, until we smell tbe breakfast cooking. How short tbe night has been! When we get up and look at tbe clock, I find it is two hours to day yet, but some fox hunters are out, and of course nobody can sleep wun toe deep, low, prolonged bayiug of a pack of hounds on tbe chase. Af ter breakfast, what is left of the family are sitting before that log fire. Some asked, "Are you too tired to read some more?" "No, I am never too tired to read to good listeners." As I read a long story the Century, and Judes there were in tnJLVujk'8;t uu jci x iuuk uhck 10 inose u&ys who a kind of yearning, a kind of regret Ah, how fast the world moves; keeps right on stops for no man. Clear the track! get out of the way! train com ing! After bidding the family good-bye, start over the mountains on another route for home. I never like to go back the same way I came, so I come up over theShut-Iu mountains. As rode along I saw the first deer track A deer had ran along the same course I was riding. I could see way ahead of me where the deer had plunged his sharp hoofs into the soft ground; here he made a turn. See how his hoof marks are turned up side ways; look out there to tbe right there they are I was taught to look for tracks; I could track a deer almost as well as a hound by watching the track. And right here, one Christmas night, two years before I was married, my old pard and brother Giles and myself spent part of a night that we shall not forget to our dying days. Christmas day had been of those bright, sunny day, such as we often "ha vejust before the cold winter sets in. That night we had a company of young folks at our home; among the number was the girl I afterward mar neu. wo young men one was my old pard came up through the Shut In from the old mill settlement and as they came they saw a large flock of wild turkeys on the roosts. The moon was in the full. My old pard said,"after tbe party is over let's go and kill some of them." After I had seen my girl safely to her home, we took our guns and started for the Shut-In. It was midnight, the moon was at its full an just at noon mark. As we hurried on great black, rolling clouds came sailing up from the west like summer thunder storm clouds. The wind began to moan and bowl through the tree tops We could see tbe turkeys in the tree tops of the tall trees swaying back and forward as the wind blew. My old pard had shot at one sitting in a tall hickory tree and missed it. I think he shot three shots at that turkey and still it did not fly. He ccalled to me and and said, "I have always heard younk ers are good at guessing, I want you to see if you can guess close enough to hit that turkey." Giles was standing by old pard, as I drew a sight with "Old Betsey" on that turkey. At the crack of my rifle, that turkey came tumbling to thejground. When Giles picked it up we found it bad just broken one of its wings. Old pard said, "You need not have shot it, the fall is what killed it." Just then we saw a bright flash of lightning and a heavy peal of thun der. "Pard," I said, "Let's get out of this; follow me." We hurried on among tbe rocks and ledges. After going about half mile we came to place among the high blurfd of rock where a ptrt of tbe bluff had fal leu and made quite a room or cavern the opening just large enough toadmit a person. This cavern was quite full of dry leaves the wind had blown in We reached the place just as the storm broke on us. O! the way it did thund er and lightning and rain. Then It turned to sleet aud hail and then snow. There we spent the night, but wasn't it cold, aud when morning came the ground was covered about four inches with snow. O, how stiff we were as we crawled out of our den and stretch ed our legs and took our march for home, aud as I passed tbe home of my girl I hung the turkey to the door handle, where they found it when they opened the door in the morning. Such times make tbe spice of life.and bow I love to look back to those days of roseate hue. How different it all looks to us now after so many years from what it did at the time. "Dis tance lends enchantment to the vie," T. P. R. Sunday Newspapers. The following paragraph is from a paper on "The American Sabbath," read at the Ocean Grove Convention, August 9, by Dr. Robert 8. Doherty, formerly assistant editor of the New York Christian Advocate. H said: 'The Sunday newspaper, as published in our chief cities, Jis a peculiarly Ameriuanin stitution. It could not be supported by its foreign patronage, nor, for that matter, without Christian patronage. It is directly hostile to the Sabbath. Now the mot serious aspect of this Sunday paper business is not so much the fact that a few journey men printers are engaged after midnight on Saturday, or that tbe fast train carries the edition with great speed, and with more or less disturbance, out into the remote parts of tbe country. The chief mischief is done in the reading of the paper. For this there is no excuse. For the harm which come from it, tbe reader is himself responsible." in this short paragraph we have again revealed to us the real object of Sunday laws, they are not sovmuch for the purpose of prohibiting all labor on the first day of the week, s for the purpose of inducing men to gotochurh by cutting off all other means of spend ing the day. From this and similiar utterances, we are warranted in the conclusion that if all tbe people would faithfully attend church every Sunday there would not be so much objection raised to the work which is done out side of church hours. fhis is not an isolated utterance. Everyone who fights the Sunday news paper makes tbe same statement. When told that more work la done on Sunday in preparing the Monday paper tbau in preparing the Sunday morn ing edition, they say that tbe Sunday work that is done by the newspaper employes is not the evil against which they strike; but that what they are concerned about is tbe fact that tbe newspapers ke9p people away from the church and destroy the effect of the sermon on those who do go. Thus they show that they are working not SuuJay rest '.fffia Vhtilrwlt : We 'rj nia this point until our Qua fh?if fnis KnnHan mnva. ueAt is nothing more nor Iets than an etlort on the part of in - churches to have tbe State legislate in their behalf, But this is not all that is shown; the paragraph Just quoted shows the seem ingly utter inability of tbe advocates of Sunday laws to comprehend the fact that the State does not possess the ame power that the Spirit of God does They want the State to pass laws to suppress a thine the evil of which, they themselves confess, rests solely with the individual. It is not a public nui sance not something which, like the saloon, tends only to destroy tbe well being of society; for whatever mischief is done, the Individual reader is him' self .alone responsible. Yet they ex pect that the State is going to remedy this evil; they expect that the State by taking away the newspaper, will make tbe individual who now reads it spiritually-minded. They do not seem to understand that the lack of spirit uality is what leads professed Christ ians to read these papers when they should be engaged in worship; and that if the newspapers were taken away, their carnal minds would find some other worldly means of gratifica tion. If they would think of the mat ter seriously, they could but confess that the suppression of the Sunday newspaper would not in the slightest degree increase the spirituality of the people; and that admission would at the same time be a confessian tnat they are more interested in having people possess a form of godliness than in la boring through the divinely-appointed Hgeucies to really convert them; in other words, that they have lost sigbt of the gospel. And so it is no doubt true that while National Reformers have so much to say about atheism on the part of those who oppose Sun day laws, they themselves are most zealously working to undermine true Christianity.
