m*r . ? r ? * * ' - ^isptch, WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 9, 2874. The Message? Its Disfigurements. W* gave yesterday a hurried fiance at toe President's annual message. We propose to refer to its repulsive features in a ?3ir msnner. We look upon it as one of tbe crudest and least dignified of all the mes sages that ever emanated from a President of tbe United States. It, is less like a paper tbat should come from tbe chief ruler ot a great nation tban any otber we ever read. Its discussions of finance and of southern affiirs are beneath the dignity of such a pa per. The financial discussion is unworthy of tbe editorial columns of a third-rate bard money piper; while its comments on tbe condition of the southern States and the rights of the negro, so far from being wor thy of the President of tbe United S'ates, would be unworthy of a mere leader in the Republican party. They sound more as if they came from a man who supposed birn M]f to be a mere guardian of tbe negroes, and tbat in tbe performance of bisguardian ship there were no local rights of the States or of tbe white people which be is bound to respect. Besides these defects in the President's views of bis obligations of a domestic na ture, bis reference to Cuban affairs seems to be an invitation to otber Powers to join in interference for the establishment of peace in Cuba. In spirit this is a complete sur render of tbe priuciple of the Moxroe doc trine, and an admission of our willingness to ec Operate with European Powers in regu lating tbe polities of this hemisphere. This is a great ^bange truru other days, when the bare intimation of an Intention on the part of a European Government to take a hand in the regulatiou of Cuban affairs would have lighted tbe land with one fhrne of In dignation. With regard to tbe currency, we consider most of tbe President's recommendations un fortunate. It is very idle to suppose that Congress can fix a day of resumption. We should regard tbe deliberate act ot the Go vernment in buting gold by tbe i>sue of United States bonds, as a step to assist re sumption, as one of the worst of measures. It wouid be the best movement for tbe gold gamblers. The importers, who have to pay duties in gold, would be bled to a ruinous degree, and the gamblers alone would be benefited. The collections of gold through dudes would be quite sufficient, without making the Government a dealer in gold to tbe serious injury of the classes who are en riching the Treasury by their heavy pay ments in tbe form of duties. The Govern ment would become tbe persecutor of its best friends. Then, there is no good reason for repeal ing the legal-tender act now. No serious charge of tbe financial laws can be very bentficial now. Tbe recommendation of tbe President tbat the people be allowed to establish banks without lim't, under the present laws, for tbe securing of the note-bolder, is good. We see no objection to it. Tbat permission, connected with the iutcrconvertibility scheme, would do well for tbe present. Leaving tbe time for resumption without day, this plan will permit things to recover in an easy and natural way, and resumption will come along with the restoration of that confider.ce without which it will be impos sible to maiutain ft. This financial question, and tbe views of the message on the affairs of tbe South, con stitute its main points of interest. We sin cerely regret tbe wayward and indefinite nature of the President's immature opinions of the ".situation" at the South. With regard to Louisiana he maintains bis old position with persistence in tbe face of all facts. He expresses emphatically bis be lief that Kellcgg was tairly elected Governor of that State, notwithstanding that leading Be publicans and all those opposed to them in politics have declared that it was a mock ery to assert that be was so elected. The President disposes of Arkansas in a singular manner. He does not interfere himself in bcr last trouble, but be describes to Congress the circumstances of tbat trou ble in a way tbat might suggest tbe pro priety of interference. He tells Congress tbat tbe late constitution provided tbat before (l amendments proposed11 to thut Constitu tion "shall become a part thereof they shall ?'be passed by two successive assemblies and ? then submitted to and ratified by a mu "jority of the electors of the State voting " thersou." President Grant, evidently assuming tbat the Constitution cau be in no otber way changed, goes on to state that on the 11th of May, 1474, the Governor (Baxter) convene* an extra session of tbe Legislature, which in the same month passed an act calling a convention of the people to frame a new constitution, which act was approved by the people on tbe 30th June, '74, who at the same time elected delegates to the conven tion which met on the 14th July and framed a new constitution, which was adopted by the people by an immense majority on the 18th of October, 1874, at which time, accord ing to the Constitution, State officers were elected who were to fill offices vacated by tie instrument# Baxter turned over the Government accordingly to Gabland, the Governor who was elected on tbel3tb. But Smith, Lieutenant-Governor, elected with ) axter, claimed the Goyernment as sueces s r to Baxter, assuming that there bad l>.!en no lawful movement to dispossess Bax TifR. This statement, solemnly madein the mes 6 ge, is sent to Cocgress along with the re ference or the whole matter to that body. The whole constitutional provision quoted by General Gkant relates to amendments to the Constitution ; but the people of Arkan sas called a convention and framed a consti ? tution : a proceeding wholly different from making amendments to an old constitution The cases are different. Tbe people of Arkansas met in convention and framed a new constitution. That is a right we have always contended the people can in no way be deprived of as long as republican govern ment lasts. New, can it be possible that Congress will dare to interfere In this matter because of tbe President's statement? a statement not at all applicable to tbe case? We imagine not. If there might have been any disposition to in terfere under other circumstances, in view of ibe recent elections there is no probability that Congress will do anything on tbe subject. Tb.e President degrades his own dignity by bis negro-talk. He leans to tbe stories of southern outrages on tbe negro notwith standing tbe ablest journals of tbe country hive, through most reliable correspondents ivbo have visited the localities of alleged out rages, found these outrages in almost every ciae either grossly misrepresented or mere Actions, tbe facts alleged sever having had {Mite act% The President inclines to those vile creations of partisan anjMpou$ dr^Ily stranger* who w?re D* ie^fsle and rob the people of the 8outlpf$ben they are rejected and execrated#^ the n iboSe ttifion. "? k President Grant gays: A4 In some places, "colored laborer* wofe cotfipelledTTO vole "iccordlng*o the wishes of their employ' <*cra under threat* of dltcbarge If they acted '?otherwise.* We shoulBTike uTtaow what right Generat GaAh* has W denounce this even It it were-troef Does not -every one know that men arc crowded Into the navy yards and custoin-Uoasea upon condition that they wiil vote the Republican ticket? And are not the office-holders atid laborers peri odically assessed with their quotas if a sum is required to piy party expenses? Were not some 800 or' 1,000 laborers discharged from the Portsmouth navy-yard alter voting for Platt, showing that they were either employed for the occasion, or retained until tbe*election was over? Can anybody sup* pose that General Grant has been ignorant of all this ? How can he censure southern people for what is the regular practice of the Administration? The thing is mon strous. But look at the fact*. Nearly all negroes are employed by whites; and see the hun dreds of thousands {f them who blindly vote the Republican ticket because, as General Grant say?, in the spirit of a small partisan rather than of President of the United States the negro " knows that hi3 friends are of that party ." Taking this example into account, bow far does the alleged iutimidation of the negro? in imitation of the Administration? euceeed ? But a little way. But the truth is the Republicias are only friends of the negro for the use they make of him. They reioh office and the stealings in the South by getting on his back. They are mere hypocrites. The true friends of the negro are the southern people, who give him employment. He begins to find this out, and puts not so much faith ia freed men's banks and freedmen's institutions as he formerly did. The message, in short, shows that General Grant is in tbe deep rut of error in regard to interference by tbe Federal Governmen1 in tbe South, and the reasons for it. He speaks of tbe people and the States as entirely at tbe mercy of the Federal Government and unqualified to govern, and as though they were animated by cruel impulses and uncivilized prejudices; whereas be should know that there are no more civilized, and generous, and humane people on the face of God'r earth than those he so unjustly asperses. It has become a habit with him. and it will bring him to grief. President Grant's message is understood to plea>e no section and no party. Congres? itself is tired of Federal interference in the Statos. It has done more to kill the Repub liean party than any other e^use. Congress will, it is understood, leave the subject to take care of itself. General Gbant may be wail tbe fate of tbe negro aad talk of tbe "amendments" as aseless unless they pro tect the negro and oppress the white people; but Congress is tired of the whole thing ; its mockery and its hypocrisy are too hideeous to be endured. Fish and Sheep. Governor Kemper does the State a great Ural of service in directiug the attention of the Legislature to tbe importance of tbe cultivation of fish and the protection of sheep. Each year proves I? the vrorld the great wisdom of fish-culture. Fish is an article of food whose importance all appreciate. Tbe use which men in eavsge life make of fish? their flocking to tbe streams at regular seasons to catch and pack away fish for future use? is a striking illustra tion of that providential guardianship which placed so valuable an article of food, in reach of races so little acquainted with the arts of clvilizition. Under the progress of civilization, and the uses of water courses that follow it, tbe supply of fish in tbe rivers is greatly diminished. Tbe art of fish-culture rapidly restocks them, and gives to dense populations ample supplies of the best food. The choiccst species are trans lated to waters where they were never known before. So great a blessing is rarely conferred upon aoen, and we cannot over estimate it. Tbe Governor wisely brings it earnestly before the Legislature. We can in no way devote the same time and money that' this measure may require with iqual benefii to the people. It becomes especially incumbent upon Virginia to contribute ber share to wards the stocking of tbe waters with fish. Many of tbe Statea arc doing all that can be done in the work. The waters of tbe Union are allied in oue great system, and tbe enter prise must be genei al among tbe States, or it will be imperfectly carried out. There never wag an undertaking which gave richer rewards for the labor devoted to It. Tbe results every where are amazing. Then, with regard to sheep, it may be said that no domestic animal is more worthy of protection. The sheep gives us cheap food, and also tho invaluable clothing which pro tects men against the weather. That such an animal should be left to the slaughter by dogs savors of barbarism. What do wc gain, who have paid a liberal price for tbe woll's scalp, when in lieu of the wolf we have tbe more destructive dog, which we make a com panion and a pet of P We trust that the Legislature may this year show a better appreciation of this sub* jeer. Tbe Governor recommends a coun ty dog-tax to raise a fond in tvery county out of which to indemnify formers for sheep de stroyed by dogs. This Is right and just. The sheep, so great a source of support and comfort to man, should not be left to tbe mercy of tbe dog, which is in the long run more of a pest than a benefit. Southern Troubles. The news of the attack on Vicksburg by negroes, and the movements in South Caro lina on account of the burniDg of gin-houses and dwellings, are commentaries upon the President's message that are most unfortu nate for its logic and sympathies. When in this Union before did a body of men march upon a city and attack its people with the weapons of war simply because a sheriff elect was not allowed to eater upon bis office I for the reason that he eould not give the re quired security forthe faithful performance I of its duties? Then, look at the terrible evil of incendiarism, which bus driven the responsible and property-holding people of a State almost to madness. The philan thropy of the message leans not to the true sufferers. The Federal Government, like the thieves on Gad's hill, has " burned the true men." Sunset Cox may make capital with a few editors, but be will displease the people. There are in Virginia about one hundred editors. All the rest of the people will be benefited by a continuaeceof the new postal law. We trust that some member will offer an amendment to Cox's bill providing for the collection of the tariff from * the, parties wbo^bn^if^G tMfojpkrted AodB, iSnchj; ft taw fopld te ^frroible a9^)me tha?*ilow? postanf tbat couid be detected from o?j? maj$ffo be lost ladder tb^jpretex^.of coliegfc? . iogjtixQm Jen thousand men.

(Tor the DLspatcb.J A Good Dog'Law. The following article is taken from the American Agriculturist, and was prepared by a citizen of Connecticut. In many States the dog-tax is devoted explosively to the support of schools. One hundred thousand dollars a year might easily be raised in Vir ginia for that purpose by a tax of one dollar on each dog : DOG-LAW OF CONNECTICUT. The following statute was passed by the Legislature of Connecticut in 1867, and w still in force: Section 1. It shall be the duty of the as sessors of tbe several towns [?'. e., townships] of this State to cause all dogs three months old and upwards which have not been registered according to law previous to the first meeting of the Board of Assessors to be entered upon the asse33ment-list of per sons owning such dog?, and such dogs shall be presumed to be owned by the keeper or occupier of the premises where 6uch dogs are kept. Section 2. The owner or owners of all dogs not registered ass aforesaid sball pay an annual tax into tbe treasury of the town [township] where such dogs are kept, to be levied and colluded with and in tbe same manner as tbe ordinary town taxes, of three dollars for every male dog and six dollars for every female dog. Another act, passed at the same session of the Legislature, provides that any excess of money in the dog-fund may be used for or dinary town expeuses after all damages done to sheep in previous years are paid lor. In the general statutes of this State, in section 113, it is provided that any two jus tices of the peace may make such rules and regulations against dogs as they think the satety of'persons and property demand. Section 114 provides that the inhabitants of the several towns, in legal meeting assem bled, may make necessary regulations and offer bounty for the killing of dogs. Section 116 requires the owner of a dog over three months old to register and number such dog in tbe town clerk's office on or be fore September 1st in each year, and to pay fifteen cents for registering. Section 116 provides tbat he sball pay into tbe treasury two dollars for every male dog. five dollars tyr every female dog so register ed, and that be shall put a collar upon bis registered dog with bis name upon it, and tbe No. of tbe dog ; and any person killing said dog sball be liable for bis value; but any one may kiil a dog found worrying sheep, whether registered or not. Section 117 provides that the town clerk shall pay all moneys received for the privi lege of keeping dogs into the treasury. Secton 118. Tbe selectmen are to post no tices in every school d^trict that dog-owners must either kill their dogs or cause them to be registered. Section 119 inflicts $50 fine upon the se lectmen who refuse 'to post such notices. Section 120 fines whoever puts a false re gister upon bis dog's collar $T. Section 121 makts it the duty of tbe first constable to prosecute all violations of tbe dog-law. Section 122. Those who suffer damage In their flocks by death or maiming Irom dogs are to give information of tbe fact to one of the selectmen of the town, who is to estimate the damuge and pay it from tbe dog-fund, unless the owner of the dog can be made to pay. These laws, of which we have given the outline, work well in Connecticut, and en courage sheep-raising. They keep the dogs in check, and make it easy for sbeep-owners to recover damage done to flocks where any Is suffered. It is our impression that dog laws have passed in most of the older north ern States, and that they are most stringent in New York and New Enlgand, where wool and mutton are most valuable. It is exceedingly desirable that we should have similar legislation in all the States, and that sbeep-busbandrv should be made so safe aod profitable that we have no occasion to import wool. The census of 1870 report ed 28,000,000 pounds of wool iu the coun try, and 100,000,000 pounds of wool as the annual product. And yet we import large quantities of wool and woollen goods that we ought to produce on our own farms and in our own factories. We are glad to be lieve that we are increasing our consump tion of lamb and mutton. Give us stringent dog-laws in all tbe States, and we might make these the cheapest of all the meats in the market. From Southwest Virginia. Editors of the Dispatch,? I am sure I cor rectly represent tbe sentiment of the com munity in which I live in saying that Gov ernor Kemper's recommendation in his mes sage of the proposition of tbe bondholders and English capitalists to arrange in tbe way they propose our State indebtedness meets with universal disapproval, and that your disapproval and comments upon it in your issue of tbe 3d of December are in complete accord with the judgment and wishes of the people of this section of country. Since the good old fashion of primary meetings of the people to direct and govern public and legislative sentiments has come into disuse, the country is more than ever dependent upon a patriotic, wise, and dis criminating public press to speak timeously and boldly upon proposed public measures ; and I am glad to believe tbe people have such a representative iu the Dispatch. Sika? [For the Dispatch.] Sire,? You quote in the Dispatch of to-day i a speech of Mr. Bross, of Chicago, in whicb be speaks of tbe splendid steamer tbe City of Tckio, that New York money had built and Eastern mechanical skill constructed. The steamers City of Tokio and the City of Peking? perhaps t he finest in the world? are said to be an honor to any country. They ?were built at Chester by Captain Jefferson Maury, a Virginian, who now commands tbe City of Tokio. Please let Virginia and Vir ginians have the credit due tbezi?. Editors Dispatch,?
