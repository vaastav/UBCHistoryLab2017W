2 the public councils; to lower the tone of National representation, blunt public con science; create false standards in the popular mind; to lamiliarize it with reliance upon state aid and guardianship in private affairs; divorce ethics from politics and place politics upon the low level of a mercenary scramble than any other single cause. Step by step, and largely owing to the con fusion of civic strife, it has succeeded in ob taining control of the sovereign power of taxa tion, never hesitating at any alliance or to resort to any combination that promised to assist its purpose of perverting the public tax ation from its only true jurisdiction and func tion of creating revenue for the support of the whole people into an engine for a selfish pri vate profit of a crowd of beneficiaries and com binations called trusts. Under its dictation individual enterprise and independence have been oppressed and the energy of discovery and invention debilitated and discouraged. It has unhesitatingly allied itself with every policy which tended to "ommercial isolation, dangerously depleted the treasury ana sapped the popular conscience by schemes of corrupt ing favor and largesse to special classes whose support was thereby attracted. Thus it has done much to throw legislation into the po litical market, where jobbers and choppers took the place of statesmen. It was incorrect to speak of protection as a National policy, for that it could never be, be cause it never eouid be other than the foster ing of special interests at the expense of the rest, and thus overthrow the great principle of equality before the law and that resultant Feii'-e of justice and equity in the adminislra tion of sovereign powers which was the sense of domestic tranquillity and human content ment. The enfeeblement of individual ener- Kii-v and the impairment of many self-reliances were necessarily involved, and the belief in mysterious power of the state and a reliance upon them took the place of individual exer tion, fostered the growth of state socialism, and personal liberty ceased to be the great end o; the (iovernment, and Whkf.eas, Such reflection on the people of the United States in a foreign country and be fore a foreign audience is manifestly in serious disregard of the proprieties and obligations which should be observed by an official repre sentative of the United States abroad and cal culated to injure our National reputation; be it Jiesoived, By the House of Representatives, that the Committee on Foreign Affairs be di rected to ascertaia whether such statements have been directly made, and if so to report to the House such action by impeachment or oth erwise as shall be proper in the premises. For the purpose of inquiry the committee is au thorized to send for persons and papers. Crisp (D.) of Georgia made a point of or der agp.inst the resolution that it did not present a question of privilege. Speaker Heed overruled the point of or der, and Barrett explained his resolution and severely arraigned Mr. Bayard for his criticism of the system of protection. Crisp defended Bayard and reviewed the history of the McKinley and Wilson tariff bills, upholding the latter and condemn ing the former. He did not think tho gentleman from Massachusetts was serious in his proposition, but thought that he simply wished to air his views on protec tion. Regarding the speech of Bayard he had no doubt it was a clear and able argu ment against the doctrine of protection and he acquitted him of any charge of im propriety. If they (the Republicans) wanted to impeach Bayard they must also impeach a majority of the American peo ple. [Democratic applause.] McCali (R.) of Massachusetts thought this country was the olace for Bayard to ventilate his views on such subjects. Dingley (R.) of Maine thought that Cri.^n had entirely avoided the question at issue and had endeavored to befog it by bringing up the question of protection and the merits of the McKinley bill or the "Wilson bill. He asked Crisp if he would approve the lauguage of Bayard if he to morrow should attack in public the advo cates of free silver and denounce them in unmeasured terms as being destructive of the business interests 01 the country. Dingley also asked that gentleman whether he believed that an Embassador of all the people of the United States had the right to go on a foreign platform and denounce a half or more of the people of the United States. "Well," Crisp began to answer in a hesi tating way, "I — " [A pause rilled with laughter from the Republicans.] "I," resumed, "I am not a diplomatist and don't know anything about inter national law, but it seems to me that any citizen of the United States, no matter in what capacity, has the right to give his honest conviction on any economic ques tion." [Applause on the Democratic side.] Dingley — Has an Embassador of the whole people of the United States that right on a foreign platform? Crisi> — He should always speak the truth.* Dihgley— l must say that lam surprised that the gentleman from Georgia would approve the conduct of a United States Embassador going on a public platform in London and making such a speech. If a former Minister had gone on a platform there and denounced the people who favor the free coinage of silver at the ratio of sixteen to one, the indignation of the gen tleman from Georgia, I am sure, would have been at once aroused and he would have seen the impropriety of such con duct. Crisp— l ask the gentleman from Maine whether he believes that the language cited in the resolution furnished good ground for the impeachment of Bayard. Dingley — I am not arguing tbat ques tion. [Derisive laughter from the Demo cratic side.] But I may say that, in my personal judgment of this matter, it is a case in which, perhaps, impeachment may tot be the proper remedy. But this House, representing the American people, should condemn the action on the part of its Em bassador to England. [Republican ap plause.] Cummings (D.) of New York said he could not say whether the resolution had been offered under false pretenses or not, but he congratulated himself on knowing that it was based on the newspaper report of a speech ; that it was brought before the House by the editor of a newspaper, was backed by the editor of another news paper printed in Boston, and that it was backed up a second time by the editor of the Lewiston Journal. It therefore seemed manifestly fitting that a newspaper writer on the Democratic side of the House (meaning himself) ought to have some thing to say on the subject. He congratu lated the correspondents in the gallery tnat the press was at last speaking for itself on the floor of the House. [Laughter.] He had no particular liking for the United States Embassador to England. He had not forgotten that Bayard had not done what he should have done toward the re lease of Irish prisoners, citizens of the United States who were unjustly incarcer ated in English prisons. He had not for gotten that Bayard was a welcome guest in the house of the English aristocracy, and was but rarely invited to a Liberal ban quet, but at the same time he should be treated with justice by even the Republi can members of the House. What had been read from Bayard's remarks resem bled very much what had been read from executive documents, and Bayard had only been reiterating that which the Presi dent of the United States had repeatedly declared in his messages and in his letters to Congress. If the United States Erabas sador at London ought to be impeached for expressing such sentiments, then the President of the United States ought to be impeached. If the resolution was not offered under false pretenses, why did not the gentleman from Massachusetts bring in a resolution impeaching the President? "Go to the fountainhead, gentlemen," Cummings exclaimed. "You have . been taking it here for nearly eight years from the President and not a whisper have we heard of impeachment. But the instant that a United States Embassador in a for eign country repeats the same sentiments there is a hue and cry for impeachment. There is nothing in it, gentlemen. It is only opening the tariff debate a 4 the pres ent session of Congress." McCreary (D.) of Kentucky, the chair man of the last Committee on Foreign Affairs, said that when Congress assembled it was confronted with grave responsibili ties and the people had tfoped that there would be legislation to ameliorate existing difficulties, but now, even when the com mittees had not been completed, the first step taken by the Republicans was to bring in a resolution for the im peachment of an American Embassador simply in order that a few gentlemen might air their rhetoric and present to the country their views on the protective tariff. The resolution is a miserable ex cuse for a debate on a subject which Rep resentatives seem to be afraid to brine up in the regular style. Bayard has spoken nothing but the simple truth, and there is nothing in what he said that will justify impeachment. Barrett called on Hitt (R.) of Illinois, formerly identified with the State Depart ment, to bey what the instructions to diplomatic and consular officers were. Hitt stated substantially that diplomatic officers abroad were especially cautioned to use the greatest reserve in all their pub lic utterances; not to allude in their public speeches to any dispute between the United States and any other Government, and, better still, to avoid public speeches whenever that could be done. Cannon (R.) of Illinois thought that the resolution should be referred to the Com mittee on Foreign Affairs. He doubted that Bayard ought to be impeached — as a matter of policy. If Bayard made the re marks attributed to him and if the Presi dent of the United States did not recall him promptly, it was the duty of the American House of Representatives, in an orderly manner, to express its disap- proval of such action by word 3 of censure. Johnson (R.) of Indiana commented sar castically on Cummings challenging the veracity of his chosen profession. The moment, he added, that an American Minister placed his feet on a trans-At lantic steamer he should see things with an American eye and should stand as the representative of the great overwhelming sentiment of the American people. For an Embassador to open his mouth in dis paragement of the institutions of his country was a gross impropriety; not only a breach of official etiquette, but a wrong vhich would call upon him the condemna tion of his whole country. Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania recalled the incident when, during the Civil War, an English gentleman, talking with Charles Francis Adams, the American Minister to London, made a remark as to the Confed erates righting well, to which Adams made the felicitous reply, "They are my coun trymen." Barrett closed the debate in a speech in which he declared it to be his purpose to secure if possible "the recall of the man who has put himself on record in a way to humiliate and disgrace the proudest peo- pie in the world." [Applause.] He criti cized the President for being absent when an important communication was re ceived from the British Government on the subject of Venezuela. That commun ication, he said, was now lying on some table— he knew not where — waiting until the season of duck-shooting on the North Carolina coast was over. On motion of Cannon (R.) of Illinois the words "by impeachment or otherwise" were struck out of the resolution. Crisp's motion to refer the resolution to the Committee on Judiciary was rejected — ayes 80, noes 206. Crisp asked a vote by ayes and noes and it was taken, resulting — ayes 90, noes 207. The question recurred to the following amendment to the resolution proposed by Barrett and it was adopted : And whereas, in a public speech delivered at Boston, England, on the 2d day of August, 1895, the said Bayard is reported by the press of this country to have said, "The President stands in the midst of a strong, self-confident and oftentime violent people — men who desire to have their own way and who need to have that way frequently obstructed; and I tell you plainly that it talces a real man to govern the people of the United States." Cannon's amendment to strike out the words "by impeachment or otherwise" was agreed to, and the resolution as thus amended was adopted without a division. A number of Democrats were observed to vote aye and but few noes were heard. The Speaker stated that by consent the preamble to the resolution would be con sidered witndrawn. At 3:35 o'clock the House adjourned until Thursday. 

FEDERATION OF LABOR Secretary Carlisle Denounced for Violating the Eight-Hour Law. President Cleveland Requested to Pre fer Charges Against the Head of the Treasury Department. NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 10.-The sec ond day's session of of the American Fed eration of Labor began at 9:30 oclock this morning. President John Mcßride pre sided. Mrs. Eva McDonald-Valosh of Minne apolis addressed the meeting. Numerous notices of resolutions were read and re ferred to the committees. The session was enlivened soon after the proceedings began by the introduction of a resolution, which was adopted, denounc ing Secretary Carlisle for alleged viola tions of the eight-hour law in the Treas ury Department and requesting President Cleveland to prefer charges against him. A number of resolutions were handed in at the afternoon session, among them being one offered by F. A.

FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1895. DOCTRINE OF MONROE Senator Cullom Declares That It Is Time to Maintain It. REaUESTS NOTj ENOUGH, This Country Should Take a Stronger Stand in Preventing Encroachments. POLICY OF, THE AMERICANS. If Let Alone Great Britain Will Fnally Dominate the Venezuelan Republic. "WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 10.— The Senate was in session for nearly two hours to-day, half of that time being occupied by Cullorn (R.) of Illinois in a speech in advocacy of the clearest assertion and most strenuous maintenance of the Mon roe doctrine. The resolution on which he spoke was then referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Petitions and resolutions were presented and referred: For the settlement by arbi tration of controversies between railroad companies and their employes; for pro tection for the American wool-growing in terests; for the prevention of "colored lynchings" in the South; for the suspen sion of the removal of "intruders" from the-Cherokee Strip; for abolition of tribal occupation of lands by Indians: and for the suppression of cruelties upon and massacre of Armenian subjects in Turkey. A resolution of the Minnesota Legisla ture in favor of the Olney arbitration bill for the prompt settlement of all contro versies between railroad companies and their employes was presented by Nelson (R.) of Minnesota and referred to the Ju diciary Committee. A memorial from the wool-growers of the United States asking protective legisla- tion for the sheep industry was presented by Sherman (R.) of Ohio and referred to the Committee on Finance. Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts presented a memorial of six clubs of colored men in Massachusett9 for legislation to prevent lynching of colored people in the South. It was referred to the Judiciary Committee. Sherman (R.) of Ohio introduced (by re quest) a bill to aid in regulating the cur : rency and it was referred to the Finance Committee. It provides for lone term 3 per cent bonds for the retirement of all de mand notes of the United States. Jones (D.) of Arkansas introduced a, joint resolution authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to suspend the removal of "intruaers" from the Cherokee country (not strip) until furtheraction of Congress. After objection the joint resolution was passed. PJatt (R.)of Connecticut offered a reso lution declaring that the United States is no longer legally or morally obliged to guarantee or permit Indian tribal govern ment in the Indian Territory. It was laid on the tabie. Call (D.) of Florida offered an Armenian resolution and it was laid on the table. Cullom (R.) of Illinois then proceeded to address the Senate on the Monroe doc trine. The Government, he said, could not afford to permit any uncertain or equivo cal construction to be possible on so im portant a subject. The Monroe doctrine is the motto which should be indelibly en graved upon the portals of the Depart ment of State. Instead ot remaining as an edict of the executive, it should bear the definite ap proval of Congress and become a fixed permanent ordinance, giving notice to all the world that the United States will not view with favor the erection of any more European colonies on these continents nor any extension of -the European political system upon this hemisphere, nor any European interposition in the affairs of the Spanish- American republics. Cullom continued: "In my judgment the time has come when the Nation should put th c question beyond cavil ; the time has come when the Nation, by its Congress, should declare the doctrine which has been so often declared by its chief executive and other represen tative men; the time has come when more positive language should be used than the old and oft-repeated declaration that ' this Government cannot view with inaifference attempts of European Governments to colonize either in North, South or Central America.' "The Nation has dallied with diplomacy long enough and without much effect. Great Britain has been disregarding polite requests, protests, arguments and sugges tions that we cannot 'look with indiffer ence' upon her policy to reach out farther nntil she, if let alone, wilHinally dominate Venezuela, The time has come for a plain, positive declaration of the Monroe doctrine by Congress, and then, if neces sary, plain, Dositive enforcement of it against all comers. "What authority entitles European na tions to such a colonial foothold on our borders? They have planted their flags on all the scattering lands and in nearly every spot on earth where they could monopolize trade or control the strategic advances of location for their own interests. "But it is our duty to be always ready to meet any and all attempts they may make to approach unpleasantly near the estab lished danger line. Our policy is the American policy, our doctrine is the pro tection of American interests and our motto is America for Americans." The delivery of Cullom's speech occu pied an hour and at its conclusion his resolution heretofore offered and reported was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Squire introduced a bill relating to the personnel of the navy and made a few re marks explanatory thereof. At 1:50 on motion of Cockreli the Senate adjourned until to-morrow. VLSTER'S EARZT BISTORT.

Doctors Fail to Arouse a Young Pennayl- ratlin Ti'otnan. WILKESBARRE, Pa., Dec, 10.-Miss Barton, a 20-year-old girl of Center More land, Wyoming County, went to sleep at 9 o'clock on the evening of November 27 and she has remained asleep ever since. A number of doctors have tried without suc cess to arouse her. The girl sleeps as sweetly and calmly to-day as when she was first called on the morning of Novem ber 28. The physicians say that except for the attack of insomnia she is in the best of health. Her pulse is below the normal, but steady and strong. Her color remains good, and she shows no sign of ill health. The nourishment, taken twice a day, is poured into her mouth a spoonful at a time. It is brandy and milk, beef tea and other liquid foods. She has become some what thinner, and this is causing her par ents considerable alarm, as they fear she will waste away and die. VOISO&ED A WHOLE FAMILY. Rough on Jtata Put in Food by a Young Xegro Girl- INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Dec. 10.— Mattie Goatley. a colored girl only 12 years old, tried to poison the family where she made her home. This morning she put a big dose of Rough on Rats in the coffee. Elias Robinson, .Eddie Tcetus and Mrs. Miranda Teetus, all colored, drank the coffee, and were at once seized with vio lent cramps and became extremely ill. .A doctor was sent for, and he administered the necessary remedies. Robinson and Mrs. Teetus had taken but little of the coffee before they had been made siok, and they responded promptly to treatment. Eddie Teetus had, how ever, partaken very freely of the poisoned drink, and his case was more serious tli an the others. It was several hours be fore the doctor pronounced him out of danger. MASSACHUSETTS ELECTIONS. Democrats Elect Their Candidate* for Mayor in Boston. BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 10.— Eleven muni cipal elections occurred in various parts of the State to-day. In nearly all instances a heavy vote was casr. In Boston a hot contest had been waged between partisans of Josiah Quincy, the Democratic nominee for Mayor, and Edwin U. Curtis, the Republican incum bent, and the result is that Boston again falls Dack into the line of Democratic cities by a plurality of about 4500 for Quincy, against a plurality of 2557 for Curtis in 1894. The following towns voted no license: Cambridge, Salem, Lynn, Medford, Bev erly and Everett. ATTACKED THE BUDGET Herr • Richter Created ■ Quite a Furor in the German Reichstag. Afraid That America Will Retaliate if the Bounty on Sugar Is Increased. BERLIN*, Germany, Dec. 10.— Herr Richter, Radical, made a violent attack on the budget in the Reichstag to-day, and was especially severe in his criticisms of the deniands of the Government for colo nial purposes and the frequency with which expeditions for colonial aggrandize ment, costing large sums of money, were organized. He then called attention to the new sugar law, which, he said, meant 50,000,000 marks increased burden to the German na tion. He felt convinced that the Govern ment sugar measures were not directed against America, and expressed his ap proval of the statement made b/ Baron Marschall yon Bieberstein, Minister of Foreign Affairs, yesterday, concerning the tariff situation between Germany and the United States. "But," he said, "if Germany should in crease the bounty on sugar America may increase the surtax. Therefore abolish the bounty, avoid the surtax and give the nation cheaper sugar.' 1 Enneccerus, National Liberal, who sits for Oldenburg, demanded that care be taken that the friendly relations with the United States be maintained. AT THE LEVER SETTLEMENT. Kate field Had a Rough Experience During the Voyage. HONOLULU, Hawaii, Dec. 2 (via Vic toria, B. C, Dec. 10).— Miss Kate Field had a severe experience in visiting the leper settlement on the 30th, in company with the Board of Health and guests. The steamer Kinau landed them early, but in the afternoon was unable to take them on account of an unusual sea breaking in. Tne sea continued the next morning. The party crossed the island twelve miles, t he steamer going around fifty miles to meet them. Through anxiety at their prolonged absence the steamer Mikahala was sent in search of them. The two boats reached Honolulu in company Sunday evening. On Thanksgiving day the Government released seven political prisoners, five na tives and two whites— Walker and Rick ard. Those remaining in prison are: Gu lick, Seward, Bowler, Bob Wilcox, Bipi kane and John Wise. Public sentiment appears to favor an early release of all. Thanksgiving morning witnessed the largest and best-drilled military display ever seen in Honolulu, over five hundred volunteers parading. THE VEXEZVELAIf DISPUTE. President Creapo Outline* What He Intends to Do. LONDON, Eng., Dec. 10.— The Times will to-morrow publish a dispatch from Caracas saying that in an Interview Presi dent Crespo declined to discuss the note sent to the Venezuelan Government by Lord Salisbury. The President did say, however, that he understood that the "demand made by Great. Britain in connection with the ai tack made upon the British police was dis tinct from the boundary question. The Venezuelan officer who was responsi ble for the attack would be punished for exceeding his duty, and the Englishmen would be compensated. He could see no reason that Great Britain should intervene in a matter that concerned Venezuela and British Guiana alone. THE bJILTAN

ONLY ONE BID RECEIVED. Edward King, Charles C. Beaman and Victor Morawetz the Purchasers. FLANS OF THE BEORGANIZERS. An Intervening Petition, However, Filed on Behalf of the Minority Interest. TOPEKA, Kans., Dec. 10. — Probably 1000 people were assembled in front of the Topeka passenger station of the Atchison, Topeka ana Santa Fe Railroad at 2 o'clock this afternoon, when J. B. Johnson, special master in chancery, appeared to sell at auction the company's vast system of rail roads, pursuant to the decree of the United States Circuit Court of August 27 last. The notice of sale began with a state ment of the incidents leading up to it and the various decrees of the court and the amount now due, $140,727,549 07. Johnson then read in detail the proper ties listed for sale, the total sum of 470 8-11 miles of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe property, extending from the Missouri River at Atchison to the Colorado line, and all the appurtenances thereto belong ing necessary to operate it; shares of capi tal stock of otner companies held by the Santa Fe, bonds of other companies held by it, in all covering every mile of railroad or vestige of stock, bonds or other prop erty held by the Santa Fe Company, the whole making up the entire Santa Fe sys tem of 9343 miles. He then, still reading this notice of sale, announced that no bid woula be en tertained without a previous deposit as an evidence of good faith of the bidder of $100,000 in money or certified check, or a quarter million dollars of the general mortgage bonds of the company; that no bid for less than $10,000,000 would be ac cepted, and that after the sale the suc cessful bidder would be required to deposit subject to the order of the special master half a million dollars in money or certified check as part payment on the purchase and as a pledge that the buyer would make good his bid. Then followed other con ditions of sale and confirmation of sale. Then the special master quietly and without any more flourish than if he were about to sell a town lot to satisfy a "boom mortgage" asked for the millionaires or their representatives who stood before him 10 make an offer. Johnson was not equal to the task of reading the notice of sale throughout. In twelve minutes his voice failed and he turned the paper over to W. H. Rossington, who read eight min utes and then was relieved by another, and so on until the reading was con cluded. At 2:30 o'clock the reading of the notice was concluded, and attorneys represent ing the minority of the bondholders of the St. Louis and San Francisco system and of $503,000 of the Chicago. Santa Fe and California bonds read a protest against the sale of the property. This done, Johnson said that in pursu ance of the notice of sale jnst read he offered the property to the highest bidder. "What am I offered?" the auctioneer asked. "I offer $60,000,000," said Edward King in a low voice. "Do I hear any more bids?" cried John son. "Once, twice— the last call. The prop erty is sold to Edward King, Charles C. Beaman and Victor Morawetz." This ended the greatest auction sale ever known, and the crowd dispersed to the Federal building, where Judee Caldwell held a session of court to confirm the sale. An intervening petition was filed to-day on behalf of the minority interest of the St. Lonia and San Francisco system in the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe re ceivership case, praying for an account ing between the Santa Fe and the St. Louis and San Francisco companies. In the language of a Santa Fe official, "it is the same old fight in a new form," and it will n6t interfere with the proposed re organization of the Santa Fe system. It is filed now presumably before the , re ceivers let go of the Santa Fe, so as to save the litigants any fights which the courts may later on decree that they possess. The articles of incorporation author izing the reorganized company to do busi ness have not been filed yet, and Aidace F. Walker, who is to be chairman of the executive committee of the new company, says they will not be till Thursday fore noon. The charter will be taken out under the laws of the State of Kansas, a special enactment relative to preferred stock having been passed by the Legis lature last winter^to meet the necessities of the Santa Fe reorganization. While official information is withheld, it is stated upon the authority of a Santa Fe man who is in a position to know, that the old name of the company will be retained. There will be a couple of changes, but none that will affect the popular name "Santa Fe," by which the system is known in the West, or "Atchison," by which it is known in the East. The pres ent title is "Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Company." The new title will be "The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company." The word "The" NEW TO-DAY. Apollinaris "THE QUEEN OF TABLE WATERS.". « First in Purity." BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. JOHN CAFFREY, 47 First St., San Francisco, Representing CHARLES GRAEF & CO., N. V., for Mineral Waters. is put in the new title because since the original charter was granted the Legisla ture has made an enactment requiring that word to be a prefix in the titles of all corporations. It is not given out either officially or unofficially what amount the capital stock will be fixed at. Before the owners of the property couid agree on the title of the new organization there was a heated discussion. Some wanted to drop any semblance of the old name and accept something new, but this was opposed for business reasons. They could not afford to drop the word "Atchi son," for by that name the company's stocks and bonds were known in the mar ket. To drop the words "Santa Fe" was equally objectionable, as that had become the company's trade-nf&rk the world over. To drop ''Topeka" would have been offen sive to the people of the Kansas capital and might have caused political trouble for the company, so it was decided to ac cept George Peck's suggestion, and the name. "The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company," was adopted. CONVENTION STORY, [Continued from First Page.] audience, which was entirely Republican, was delighted. Mr. Warner next announced that the California delegation had come to pay their respects. George A. Knight of San Francisco was at once hurried to the front and called upon for a few remarks. He made a good-natured, jocular speech and assured his St. Louis friends that it was good policy to locate the convention in Missouri. California, he said, was big enough for an empire and fair enough for an Eden. "We have shared," said he, "in the bene fits of protection. We have been protected from your vices and incidentally from your virtues." Short speeches were also made by Mr. Kerens of Missouri, Messrs. Osborne, Rader and Freidrich of California; ex- Senator Clayton of Arkansas, Senator Elkins of- West Virginia and Congressmen Jones and Bartholdt of Missouri, in the order named. In addition to the balloting for the loca tion of the convention the committee also transacted in executive session some un finished and some new business, which is herewith briefly summarized: The first matter disposed of wa3 the resolution of Mr. Payne to change the basis of representation in the convention, seconded by Mr. Hahn of Ohio. Mr. Ewing, who held Mr. Payne's proxy, that gentleman being now in Europe, stated lhat he was authorized by his principal to withdraw the proposition, and by unani mous consent it was agreed that this should be done. On motion of Mr. Lamb of Virginia the date of the National Convention was fixed for Tuesday, June 16. Then came the balloting for the location of the convention, which was conducted amid considerable excitement. The roll of States and Territories was called and the member from each announced his prefer- Before the result of the final ballot was announced Air. de Young of California moved to make the selection of St. Louis nnanimous. The motion was seconded by Mr. Campbell of Illinois and Mr. Martin of Pennsylvania and was of course adopted. The usual committee empowered to make all arrangements for the convention was then appointed, consisting of the executive committee and the following additional members: Evans of Minnesota, Lamb of Virginia, Brayton of South Caro lina, Clayton of Arkansas, Scott of West Virginia, Huston of Indiana, Long of Florida and Leland of Kansas. Several matters in connection with the preliminaries of the convention and the election of delegates were suggested and discussed without action, further than to come to a general understanding as to the meaning of the convention rules regarding them. It was the understanding that delegates must be chosen in the same manner as candidates for Congress ; also that no restriction would be placed upon districts as to the time when delegates may be chosen between the date of issuing the call and thirty days prior to the meeting of the convention. The question of increasing the represen tation in the convention of the Territories was presented in line with the action which gave New Mexico and South Dakota six delegates for the last convention. The following resolution offered by Mr. Carey of Wyoming was adopted as a substitute for several suggestions: Resolved, That in addition to the representa tion now authorized by the niles of the Na tional Convention for the Territories of Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arizona the com mittee advises each oi said Territories to elect four delegates, and the admission of such addi tional delegates to the convention is hereby Mrs. J. Ellen Foster was invited, on motion of General Olarkson, who spoke of her as "the best Republican in the United States," to address the committee. She urged upon the members the necessity of encouraging and extending among women the work in behalf of Republican prin ciples. As an evidence of its importance she mentioned that had it not been for the votes of the women in Colorado Wolcott would not have been returned to his seat in the Senate. The only protection dooument circulated under Congressional frank sine* the present administration came into power, Mrs. Foster said, was the report of the hearing of sixteen working women which she had brought to this city before the Senate Committee on Finance. Woman suffrage, she said, was a coming fact, and the Re publicans would be wise if they made love to them before their political affections were engaged elsewhere. George Crist, financial agent of the National League of Republican Clubs, was introduced to the committee. Authority was given the league to collect funds for the prosecution of its work between now and the date of the assembling of the next National Convention.

The committee then adjourned subject to the call of the chairman.
