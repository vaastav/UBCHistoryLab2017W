Secret of Happiness The pursuit of happiness is the In alienable right of man. A happy Christmas is the Inalienable right, of all children. The laws of nature and the constitu tion of the United States give this privilege to every man who has tho spunk to work for it and to claim It when Ire has earned It, li is the duty of the community to see that no child Is cheerless on Christmas day. That Is why The Herald lias under taken the stewardship of the fund being raised for the big Christmas feed, entertainment and distribution. .Happiness, the kind that won't rub off. according to the best philosophy^ consists mainly In making other happy. That being conceded, here is an oppor tunity for everybody to share in the joy. . Contributors are conferring a lasting happiness on themselves, are helping to keep crime down and are fulfilling the advice of the sages of old in seeing that no child is forgotten by Santa Claus. Gifts by Boys Two letters, written in behalf of boys, show the kind hearts that beat. in Southern Callfornians* breasts.

A SHALL BOY •INDEPENDENT" LAUDS COMMENDABLE WORK OF HERALD FRIENDS The California Independent of Los Angeles, of which Andrew Park has just taken editorial charge, in its cur rent issue calls attention to the Christmas dinner and entertainment. The Independent is full of good things this week, but nothing, perhaps, strikes the Christmas keynote more true than this editorial reprinted here: A Great Work by The Herald The Los Angeles Herald is doing a most commendable and praiseworthy work in preparing to feed about 3000 children at the Y. M. <:. A. hall on Christinas day. The excellency of this work Is not measured alone by the pleasures and comforts that will be given the chil dren on that day, but will live In their memories in years to come, and no doubt will have much to do with de termining heir characters, for a child to be hungry and cold on Christmas day, and that within full hearing of church bells where the more fortunate are to receive . presents, Is sad In a degree inexpressible; but for that child to know that other hearts beat In sym patyh with It and to be the recipient of kindness linking Its affections to the kind givers is to Inspire it to a noble life. **■-■■ No doubt hundreds that will be fed and clothed on Christmas day will in ■ years to come look hack to the Herald and to the noble people that have as sisted this journal in Its commendable work, with not only gratitude, but with a resolution to emulate this truly Christian deed. - i Moreover, the magnitude of this work is not measured alone by tne good that it is doing these children, ; but through the letters i published ln the Herald from grateful children the at tention of many of the people of Los Angeles has been directed to a state of affairs which but few had knowledge of formerly, and this has moved many of our citizens to co-operate with the Herald in this work of kindness. Probably do city of the size of Los Angeles has fever i destitute children, yet it is a fact within our knowledge that there are many children in our city that tire going barefooted to school and' without sufficient food.

CONTROVERSY WITH SOLONS STIRS GOSSIP WASHINGTONIANS ON QUI VIVE OVER ROOSEVELT CONGRESS' LAST SESSION ONE OF SNAPPY EVENTS ■ V Political Casualties Forecasted —Chief Executive's Attack on Senate May Lead to Much Trouble [Special to The Herald.l WASHINGTON. Dec. With the adjournment of congress until after the holidays Washlngton ians are busily gossiping of the series of events which already has character ized the short but snappy sessions of the second half of the sixtieth congress. Not the least Important of these "events" was that portion of the presi dent's message criticising the higher law makers in connection with civil service details. It was like a bomb hurled into their midst, for it created havoc not only in the Democratic ranks but in the Republican ranks as well. Many senators declare that in sub stance" and by inference the president has denounced them as so many ras cals, and the resolution appointing a special committee to investigate the president's language portends political casualties which old-time prophets hesitate to forecast. '•*-' Leading solons say the president has stirred a hornet's nest with which he is not yet through. Aside from the fight between the sen ate and the chief executive, to say nothing of the hubbub of gossip which is Circulating relative to the president's actions at the close of what had gen erally been considered a triumphant ad ministration, there is a great deal of speculation as to what will ensue from the president's attack on several of the large newspapers of the east, whose enmity he lias created because of their demands for an Investigation of the Panama canal bonds deal. May Resent Attack These newspapers, the Indianapolis News, the New York "World and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. It Is believed will bttterly resent the president's attack, which is considered more or less dam aging to them because it came in an exceptionally forceful document—his message to congress. The president's messages, it is maintained, should con tain no reference to political or per sonal feuds. ■■'.- '.** •;■' Joseph Pulitzer, whose prosecution for criminal libel President Roosevelt practically demands at the hands of the government's department of justice in connection with published statements relative to the $40,000,000 Panama canal purchase, is editor and proprietor of the New York World and St. Louis Post- Dispatch. While bitterly opposing the nomination of William J. Bryan for the presidency in the last campaign, the World was the leading newspaper in the support of the Democratic ticket in the east. • ■ .. . • " ' Douglas Robinson, whom the presi dent defends in his message, and whom he declares was viciously maligned in the World's Panama canal articles, is Mr. Roosevelt's brother-in-law, and a wealthy and prominent real estate dealer In New York. Poultney Blgelow. who throws down the gauntlet to the president, practically daring Mr. Roose velt to proceed against htm in court for his statements relative to the canal, is a writer of international prominence, and a personal friend of the German emperor. At present he is in New York. These men, it is prophesied, will carry the controversy now begun to a definite decision.
