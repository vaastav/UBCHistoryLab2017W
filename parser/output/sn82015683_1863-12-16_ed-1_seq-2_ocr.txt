No one hue, who had icccm to the proper source of information, wa at all urricd at the radical tone and ahamd h.ntu:c of the mes.sajre; and, as I had w arned tlic readers of tho Times to expvet the mont ultra radical .scntjments, and a full indorsement of ti c atrocious Wliiting and Sumner doctrines, in that douimetif, they, too, wen? no dotibr prepared fbl it. Ncvcrth Ios, a thrill of honor ran through the bitavt of tie true licorvjientntivcs of the oeoidc. and of the sH (-tnto: s in the crowded galleries of the Iloue, as the Clrk read those rOitentu s'"nten-es, in which the obscure IlHuol flatlH)atm:n dared to assert, in the presence of the past glories of the Hepublie, tlie infamous flehx)d that the South ern States existed no longer; and to declare that, if they were ever recognized a S ate again, it mnt ho after ther sliall have pulled down their venerable Slate governments, abolished their ca crcd State j ns:ituiions, and, in a word, revolu tionized tlnir whole system of internal policy. The gidl My was wann" but I felt chilled to toe very marrow when I thus heard Abraham Lin coln declare that ten -overeigh Stotcs, equal and lion n ed nicmlicrs of the U tuiblic, .hould never I bo allowed to return to the Union, not otdv until after thev sliall have t un down the tdllars of their Suite governments, and corercd themselves with the fra-jments of their former glory, but, nho, not until t!iev hall have aequiestvd in, and app osed of, all the illegal, unjust, and uncon stitutional a-ts of him, Abraham Lin o!n, and his l.i-.t in tun ious Congress! not until afic r they sliall have bowed down in the du.t, and have ung hosannai over the Ihnaneij ntion Proclama tion and the Coiiiiscation Act! Such is, in brief, the pith and sub-tam e of the Prcident' message. The intelligent readers of the Timos will of course peru-e it for tlrmclves. The naiiou will ucver, never taud the monstrous usurpation which is now boldly proclaimed ns tho policy of the present administration. The President dares to assume that all the people of all the Southern State have committed treason, and are, therefore, objects of Executive clemency. Does lie not know that the people can read? And docs not the Constitution plainly say that no person ehall I? convi- ted and be deemed guilty of ticason except after a fair "trial by jury, in orxn eourt? Besides, doc not the Constitution plainly say that those only are guilty of treason who make war on the Conti;titional Govern ment of the United States? The verdict of his tory will read that Abraham Lincoln himself, and his'politicnl advisers, arc in that category, quite a much a? those who arc arrayed in arras. But what imprudence it is in him to assume that all the people in the South are traitor, and to de clare that they ratut take a test oath lefore they can be allowed to vote or to exert ise nny of the rights of citizenship! No noubt he think he is very smart in paving that no man is compelled to take his oath. Vet his proclamation .-how that he intends, us far as his power extends, that no citizen of the South shall ever Imj allowed even to vote e.gtiiti, until he has taken this oath. Can anything be more monstrous? Iook, for a mo ment, at the terms of the oath. The owner of a plantation, whoso slaves have been, taken from him by tho emancipation proclamation, whoc ! crops have been left rotting in tho ground, who sees poverty und starvation staring him in the! face in cnequenec and whose daughter was, one of tho-c young ladies at the seminary at ; Athen, in Alabama, who were subjected to' the i luts of Tun hin' boldiers this unfortunate gen tleman is told that he mav vote, and that he shall '. I have a full pardon for the aliove o;Ti.nc (what cruel mockerv!) if he w ill sw ear thnt lie aonroves. Vnd i- in favor of the traanrioatrm proclamation and the negro soldier bill; and, if ho refuses $o to swear, he is to be regarded as a traitor, and all hi remaining property is to be confiscated. . Such, your readers will lind, i tlie plain English ; of the ni ssae of Abraham Lincoln, formerly ' cook, or assistant cook, for a mess of (our honest white soldiers in the Blnrk Hawk war. 1 But still more impud t'rt i- t!:M feiiurc of the I ni'.xs,"" wliich assume to sweej away all the State government of nil the Southern S'atcs by a single stroke of the pen. This r later of vulgar stoiie dofs not even take the trouble to enti r into any argument to prove tha: tlie Southern States no longer exist a States r,f course bave no longer any State governments. Oh. r.o! IL say virtually "77 has been so well done1 by rhe letter of Sir. Solicitor Whiting of the War Department, and bv Senator Sumner in his At lantie Monthly article, that we will conider tho-e poinis settled.

It is only a method of estimating the truo character of the radical poliev that we suggest thi question Would a true lover of the old Uni"n, or of any union le tween t!ic Northern and Southern States, a patri ot sincerely desiring to bring the war to a doe bv the achievement of its original object, take this way of doing it? Could he fmd no letter? Tt Is a fair and a most itr jKrtunt question. The President doubtless think the plan the best that he can devie with bis peculiar views. Indce! he says as mneh. It is then tho culminati-.in of tlie rtvlic&l policy, and tin only visible; method, in the view of Mr. Lincoln and his friends, bv wdiich peae is t le attained. It must be com id cred the .'.bsohite rum total of the w isdom of the present Administratitn- the only means w hich it can devise for restoring peace to our distracted country. The effect of the adoption of this ultimatum, bv the Administration, on tho poopb of the Nor;h must necessarily be to draw a line lotwcen those who think with it that the I'nioii eau only lc restond by a total reduction and submission of the rebel-, and those who think that peace could Ik? haiteaed by a wise and statesmen like .disposition or conciliation. Mr. Lincoln felici tate himself on the result of the late elections. a if the course of the na'ion on the slavery ques tion bad been decided Rf them, and that too by immense and unchangeable majoritic. We ate inclined to think h" tnitkes the fact, while ii is certain that he forgets the enormous expense, of money men. and reputation which it ha cot his Administration to carry those election. And if tho question cam- up, fairly and squarely before the people, .shall tho emancipation proclamation and the conrist ation acts be repudiated, shelved, erased, if possible forgotten, provided the South ern peoph repudiate their secession acts and re turn to their duty as citizens and snbie ts, we say if thi question came b .forc the people of the North, the immense majority of them would vote Aye with a s-hout. We think this fact Mr. Lin coln leave out of hi account. The prospect seems to be that the Presidential election will afford an opportunity for testing bow far this is the feeling of the people. The poli-y of the Administration ha been to make war on th? rebels by making war on their pet in stitution. The result, according o our idea, ha? 1een thnt the war ha cost five time a. much as it ou.d.t. and h:is been indelinitly prolonged by the mistake. We bar? wasted our time and money in i-trcngthatiing the enemy an 1 binding his loose force more and more closely together. Now wc have the rest of the policy laid out. No end of the war except by the tnt.il abolition of slavery, and thar policy is to Ik? submitted to the peopl" for approval. Will they --ustainit by continuing it for years longer? The message of the Presi dent i intended to submit this pie-tion. It is the last message, in the ordinary course, before the Presidential election, and it is tolerably certain thar it secure Mr. Lincoln a renornination. N. Y. Journ. of Com.

That portion of it to w hich the eves of all men will naturally turn first, is the promised plan of the President for the pacification of the country, which, now we have it, must -crtainlv be reckoned egre gjous. Whatever doubts mav have been heretofore entertained, if any, as to the extent of the radical influemce.s ojxTating 1 upon his mind, the plan p:opo-vd by him neces-1 sarily remove them all. Hesitating, as uaal, and uvovdng that he others his mode of settling a great civil conflict, oply as in conformity with his "present impression;" and distinctly declar ing that "it must not be understood that no other mo le would he acceptable" to Lim, he nevcrth 1 re-nmrms his emancipation proc lamation, nunonnce thar he shall not "attempt to modify or retract it," and accordingly decrees the acceptance of the emancipation project by the pco' lcol' the shvc Stares to Ik the inexorable condition of their restoration to the Union that i, according to "hi present impressions." To argu this question eem to ns merely childish. Wlrth'-r our military fortunes in the future pmve nvrc or les bri'liant than they Lave b' en in the pa-f, it i clearly not likely that en forced cmaneiprion, much le voluntary, will take effect during Mr. Lincoln term. Accord ing to his statement, a hundred thousand, of the nearly four millions of lave in the Sousli, have been lib? red bv the advance of onr armies, with in the ernvi of almost three year that the war has actually raged. To the most ordinary ap-p-c'ien-ion, one would think it might eecm 'plain that hi mode of pacification, though it might in time convert the entire South into the wilder ness which it ha o largely becom-?, under the ravages of war, r.nd mi-!it icihicc it people to a condition of conmanvive babarism; yet, afier generations of civil conflict, in comparison w ith ths honors and ruin of whih all the negroes that ever cxited on the face of the earth arc but as the mall du-t of the balance, the negroes in thoc States will vtill le sLitc.
