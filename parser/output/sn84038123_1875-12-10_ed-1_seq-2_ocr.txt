While the Madisonian is commenting on the course of the citizens of Bozeman, we would ask if it remembers how many men were hung on one beam in the old log building opposite the Virginia Hotel in Virginia in 1864? Was it not the citi I of Virginia who bung them? It is the opinion of the United States Attorney-General that Ann Eliza, the nineteenth rib of Brigham Young, violated the statutes In marrying Brigham, and could not, therefore, avail herself of her «wn wrong.

It can bard]y be possible that the Jouw nal is ignorant of the fact that the Gov eminent already has, by commission, ex plored "those hills'* with a view of ascer taining "its mineral resources." The lan guage used by the Journal certainly docs not imply ignorance. The conclusion is forced upon us, therefore, that the Jour pul for so me reason lias started out to give Prof. Jenney a most beautiful snubbing. Wanreeorioos to know what Proi.

TWEED'S ESCAPE. He is Permitted to Visit his Fami ly and Slips Away. The Oircumstonces Attending hie Flight as Related by the Officers. TELEGRAPHIC NEWS. Great Excitement New Yore. December A- Wm. M Tweed has escaped from Ludlow street jail. A dispitcb was received At the police headqurters this evening stating that Wm. M. Tweed bad just escaped from the custoday of Warden Dunham of the Lud low street jail. Word was immediately telegraphed to every police station in this city, Brooklyn and neighboring cities, no tifying them to be OX THE LOOKOUT. Warden Dunham snbseq**ntly called on Inspector Dllks, at the central police of fice. and stated that he had accompanied the prisoner to the residence of Mrs. Tweed, corner of Madison avenue and 59th street, and while there Tweed requested permission to see his wife privately. Dun bam unhesitatingly granted the request Tweed went up stairs to his wife's rooms leaving one of his sons to entertain Dun ham and the deputy. After wailing about ten minutes Dunham became uneasy and sent young Tweed up stairs to tell hi? father to come down immediately, as they lesired to return to the jail. In a short time the young man returned and inform ed Dunham that His FATHER HAD GONE. Dunham at once searched the house, but oo trace of the Boss could be found Dunh <nt hurried to the resilience of Sh. rill Conner an«i Informed hitn of the escape. The polie*- authorities were promptly no tified and the Central Office detectives at once went out scouring the city in all di rections. Deputy Warden Gardner, in charge ot Ludlow street jail during Warden Dun ham's absence, siafed that neither he noi any person in the jail learned of Tweeds absence until about half past eight. A man rang the bell, and the door was open ed by tbe deputy warden. A man not known nor tace familiar, said that Ward en Dunham had seat him down to the jaii to say that Tweed had escaped. Furthre than this he couldn't say and he then took bis dedarture. It is supposed Tweed left the jail about 4:30 p.. m. with Dun bam. It is also though, th'* keeper, Ed ward Hogan, accompanieu jem as be hadn't since been seen at the jail. This afternoon the Deputy Warden took an af fidavitto Tweed who sig«ed it in his room, but the deputy didn't know the con tents. Mr. Tweed was visited by his counsel, Mr. David Dudley Field, and Wm. Edelstem, a business partner of Mr. Tweed's sone at one time. Although three unoccupied houses ad join the residence of the Boss, none of hem were searched. In 20 minutes after the police were notified of the escape word had reached every police station; and a mounted squad was out in force, riding through the suburbs at full speed. In spector Thorne received notice and soon was at the preont station house. Taking Sergeant Whitcomb and detective Me Gowan, he visited the house of Tweed, and leaving a force of men to GUARD TUB ENTRANCE, searched from roof to cellar; not the slight est trace could be found. Sheriff Conner called a number of deputies and visited all th< up town police precints. President Matseil of tbe Board ol Commissioners, was visited at his residence, and there all imaginable plana for the captuje of the fugitive were talked up and pat into exe cution. The authorities seem utterly be wildered. 

DETECTIVES WEBE SENT to every part of the city where there was the least possible show of Tweed being found, and the officers on the approaches to the North and East rivers w ere special ly instructed to be watchful, Mataeii said in hi* opinion Tweed escaped earlier than reported, or the police would have been more successful in finding at least a sligk clue. Sheriff Conner bas issued arewatdof $10,000 for the arrest of Tweed. When Warden Dunham returned to tbe jail to night he stated that he had been dining with Tweed on tbe boulevard, and they retained to the hoase of Tweed's son-ii* law, Mr. Douglas, where Tweed's wife re sided. Tweed asked leave to go up stairs to see his wife, which was granted. He staid 15 minutes, and be, (Dunham), be coming uneasy at his absence, sent Tweed's son after hiui, who returned and said his father was not there. The Warden rash ed to the front door and looked up and down the street, but saw no person re sembling Tweed, who U; d taken bis hat but left bis overcoat and shawl. Hogan, assistant jailor, says he saw Tweed go up three or four steps of the stairs, but is not certain that be went np the full flight.— The I muse was searched from top to bot lorn but no trace fou d. Tweeds son was in a very excited condition on learning o the »scape. He palled his hair and ex claimed that be was mined, as did also Douglas, the son in law. Dunhaiu admits inking Tweed ont to dnr** three or four times while he was in i.is custoday, as Tweed was complaining ot headaches. The bonds of tbe Sberifl for tbe proper and fnitbfu) performance of bis duties are for $50,060, t"d those of tbe Warden are for $2U.U00. In Tweed's bedroom in th«* jail, directly over bead of the bed, is tbe motto, '*In God we Trost." New Yobk, Dec. 5.—A report has been in circulation ail day but cannot be veri fled, that Tweed escaped a week ago aud is now away from tbe country. Sheriff Conner and Warden Dunham are liable to n fine of $1,000 and one years' impdaowMot for their neglect, and if Tweed is uot forthcoming they will be apt to get the full benefit of the law. lawloHia OanunisaiMer.

The opening of the Forty Fourth Goto gress was marked by the presence in and around the capital of a larger crowd, probably, than ever before watched simi tar proceedings. Although wet and dreary weather, it seemed to have little or no effect in restraining the eagerness of tbe multitude which flowed into the ity the past few days, and from an early hour the galleries of tbe House Represen tatives were packed as closely as possible The Hall itself and all approach and every available space became gradually tilled up, until, as the hour of noon ap preached, it was difficult for one to mak his way in any direction through tbe mass. The majority of them are directly or indirectly interested in places oi emoluments which changes of political parties in the House of Representatives offer.
