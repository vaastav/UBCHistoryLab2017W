Present Term Reading, Which is Done in Person, Re- quires But Thirty Minutes Galleries Are Crowded i With Interested Spectators Washington, Dec. 2. President Wil-jthe' son read his first annual message to congress today at a joint session of Doth tranches at 1 o'clock in the house chamber. The message, among the briefest documents of its kind from any president, about 3,000 words long, required less than 30 minutes for reading, though it treated upon a variety of subjects.., The Mexican situation President Wiiscn' dismissed with brief comment, reiterating the sentiments he expres sed in a special address to congress upon the same subjects some time ago, and expressing the belief that the Huerta government slowly was crumbling and that the United States probably would not be obliged to alter its policy of waiting. Wants Trust Legislation No plan for the first legisla tion was presented ether than mention of the desirability of an early amend ment to the Sherman law, "to pre vent private monopoly more effectual ly than it has yet been prevented" and an announcement that the presi dent would later address a special message to congress dealing solely with that subject. The Mexican Situation The message opened with this com ment on the Mexican situation: "There is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has snown itself to the south of us and hangs over' Mex ico. There can be no certain pros pect of peace in America until Gen eral Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in, Mexico;, until it is understood on all hands, indeed, that such, pretended, governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the goyersment of the United States. We are the friends of constitutional government in America, we are more than its friends, we are its champions, because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we would wish in every way to make proof of our friendship, work out their own deve lopment in peace, in liberty." The president observed that the power and prestige of the Huerta gov ernment was rapidly crumbling and added: "We shall not, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful wait ing." ; ! A Slight Delay President Wilson arrived at the capitol just before 1 o'clock today to read in person his first annual mess age to a joint session, of congress. He went at once to Speaker Clark's room, where he was met by a com mittee of the house and senate and escorted into the house chamber and to the rostrum. The joint session and the reading of the message did not begin promptly at 1 o'clock, as had been provided, because of the failure of the senate roppsa in timA to ee.t over to the honse chamber. It was within one-era and it was feared that the three minute of one before the senators (men entombed had perished. Res were firing over to' the other side of cuers reported the rock still falling.

"She borrowed money from her friends frequently because she was unable to make a living at the practice of medicine and at the time of her death she was preparing to train herself for physic al culture worn."
