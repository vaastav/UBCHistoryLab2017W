It -was natural that Mr. Carnegie should ? offer tlu? gift in the form in which ail j his gifts must of necessity be made?the j form in which the bulk nf hi* fortune j is invested. It was natural that he shouid stipulate, as he hail in the other j gifts, th: ?. the bonds should be held for ?? long p?rioVl. It would 1.?.? unjust to ? the steri properties ar.d to the endowed Institutions to imperil them by exposing Un m to the danger of bavins- huge blocks j of the steel bonds thrown upon the mar? ket suddenly. On the other hand, it was impossible for President Roosevelt to put the Gov ; eminent in the position of being a bul ; wark of a private industrial enterprise of any kind, especially of a steel trust.

The permanent or? ganization was then, definitely decided upon. When the meeting adjourned it was with the understanding thru ?Mr. \ aden would call them together in a short time, when permanent officers would be chosen; For a long time the dairymen, who supply the city with milk, have realized the advantages to be d'e rived from an organization, where mat? ters affecting all the milkmen might be discussed. The lirst meeting? of dairymen was last fall, when the question of rais? ing the price of milk was before them. They all realized that if they acted at all they had to do so concertedly. It was at this meeting that they agreed* to put the price of milk to seven cents a quart, where it wns six cents before. At this very iirst meeting another matter was brought to their attention in which, too, they had to act concertedly. The drivers of the milk wagons wanted to be allowed to make but one trip on Sunday, just as they do on holidays, such as Christmas ?Jay and the Fourth of July. As there is no organization, the petition prepared by the drivers has never been acted upon. This paper is one of the lirst things live? ly to come before the body upon its per? manent organization. One of the most prominent dairymen said to a Times writer last night that he did-not see how the petition could be granted, as the cus? tomers would be apt to object to it, but that ho was willing to do everything in his power to make the lot of the drivers less hard.. This same dairyman said that the price of milk, in his opinion, would never get back to six cents, and the peo? ple bad just as. well make themselves contented to pay seven. Mr. Vaden will likelyi be president of the new organiza? tion.
