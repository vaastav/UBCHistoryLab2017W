THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE AND CAPE COUNTY HERALD, FRIDAY, DEC. 10, 1913. THE CAPE AND THE CAPE COUNTY HALD Erery Fridty ij . THE CAPE GIEAEDEAU PUBLISHING COMPANY. JAMES P. WHITESIDE, Editor. ONE DOLLAR PER YEAR IN ADVANCE RICHARD PEARSON HOBSON . Richard Pearson Hobson, demagogue and political blatherskite, comes M Cape Girardeau today to deliver a paid lecture on prohibition. He will preach a theory that the people of Alabama, his home state, repudiated, and which banished him from Congress. Alabama is a state with stringent temperance laws. Hobson, true to himself as a worshipper of popular fancies, became a candidate for the United States Senate, with national prohibition as his platform. Oscar W. Underwood was Hobson's opponent. Underwood declared himself for sanity ruthcr than insanity, or the song of Hobson. As the state of Alabama favored temperance, Hobson was confident that J:.- would win. He thought his state would prefer a prohibitionist with a fl.-nncl mouth, to a statesman who had been tried and not found wanting. The people discarded Hobson and his effiminate manners by a majority of approximately 40.000 votes. This merely illustrates what the people among whom he lives and who know him best think of Richard Pearson Hobson. His record in Congress was merely an advertising campaign for the benefit of Hobson and at the expense of the government. He accomplished nothing, except to get before Congress his national prohibition amndment, which was defeated overwhelmingly by a Congress controlled by men of his t wn political faith . While a member of Congress Hobson abused the franking privileges of tic government to exploit himself. He sent letters to newspapers all over the United States, using the government frank and pleading for a fund of 'il 0.000. In these communications he brazenly admitted that he was tak ing advantage of his franking privilege to send his prohibition .-leech t;i every home in the United States. According to the government reports, there are approximately 16.000,000 homes in this coun t iv, and by using the government frank to send his speeches to each of these, h saved himself about $250,000. Hobson's letter, outlining his plan, follows: Dear .Mr. Editor: I am sending you under a separate cover a copy of my recent Prohibition speech, and also, for your information, a copy of a standard individual letter to accompany same. Before my right tn use the Government frank expires next Fall, I wish to send the speech and letter individually into all the homes of America. W hile my part of the cost is but a fraction of the total cost to the Government, yet covering the whole country, it will amount to about $1.V),000. Would you. through your columns, help to raise the fund? In order to facilitate your action, I am enclosing a draft for a news article which can be used as the basis for editorials. Faithfully yours, (Signed) R. P. HOBSON. Hobson is here today to deliver his lecture for a certain amount of i.tcney. When he concludes his speech, he has earned his fee. He is not advocating prohibition for any benefit he believes the people will derive. He i.-. preaching prohibition because he needs the money. The people of his home state sent Hobson to Congress and when he re- i.nr.ed, he was relegated to the junk heap. In Congrss he was known as he man who had kissed more women than all the members in the lower house. On his record, Mr. Hobson has convicted himself of being a political ! izzard with an itching palm. ON THE m BOARD Slate Arranged at SUr-CIiamber . Caucus Everybody a Gum- Shoe Artist. Ull OR AND THE COFFIN, The Tennessee Cofiin & Casket Company, and one of its employes, at ( huttanooga. has been convicted upon charges of shipping bottled whisky in ro'.Tms "without proper labeling." It, of course, didn't make a great deal of difference to those to whom the liquor was consigned whether the liquor was "properly labeled" or not. .!'..! so th" whisky was perfectly good liquor . The testimony dining the trial showed that when a consumer of wet goods living in a dry community ran short of his "mornin's mornin," he simply wired the casket company to ship post haste one coffin. There is a grim and solemn suggest iveness about the box which it is our common lot to fill that might make a coffin full of whisky an undesirable package to receive, but such inconsequential things are forgotten in dry T'linessee. That state is the home ofthe southern colonels, and these colonels insist t lat as the corn is full of kernel, the colonel should and must be full of corn. And it isthe desire to live up to this slogan that has driven the Tennessee clone! to uncanny acts to get that which he feels is essential to good health, 1 ng life ami merry Christmas. Persons ordering coflins for their customary uses would hardly expect ; bottle of whisky to close the bargain, and it was that point which the prosecutor leaned on. He felt and he seems to have been justified that the man who must (ill a coilin is naturally surrounded by spirits, and would not care to complicate the situation. There, he said, the coflins were not for ending corpses. Hut regardless of the law inthe case, it must have been easy for the -illm company to sell cheap caskets f iled with good liquor .and we venture j o ;;:iy that those who bought never questioned the variety of timber used in 1 ho caskets. There is an old sea story told in which a sailor found full of joy upon :h deck confessed with a wink of humorous appreciation that he had "auped the silent passenger," when nobody was looking. The "silent pas ".iger was a corpse that had been shipped in a sealed tin box of rum to preserve the body on its long journey. Circumstances sometimes call for heroic ivcasures. Details of the "slaf-chamber" meet ing of directors of the Cape Building & Loan Association in which Judge D. F. Davis agreed to allow himself to be "rolled" in favor of H. H. Haas as a member of the new Board of Direc tors to be elected Monday, yesterday became known. A genuine "slate" was prepared at the caucus Wednesday night, held by the administration forces in the offi ces of the association and presented that night to Mr. Haas for his ap proval. The "slate" contained Haas' name and those of all the administration di rectors now in power, except Judge Davis. How the directors reached the con clusion to discard Judge Davis' name has not been revealed, but it is said, the Judge has contemplated for some time, resigning as attorney for the as sociation as well as director. After the "slate" had been formed, the directors carried their scheme a step further. They created what prob ably may known as a "voting trust." The plan arranged for the selection of a single stockholder upon whom all "proxies," collected both by the ad ministration forces and Mr. Haas, should he agree to the "slate," were to be bestowed and "voted" when the time comes Monday. This individual stockholder would necessarily have to be a "neutral," it is understood. The entire proposition was put up to Mr. Haas, who joined in the agree ment. Dr. W. E. Younf was named at the "star-chamber" session as first choice to "vot?" all the "proxies." It had been planned that should Dr. Yount decline to serve in the capacity of wholesale "voter" for the directors, Herman Bremermann, of the First National Bank, was to be approached as second choice. if v,..,i n,.f i..,.. ,inr;n;tr.K-1 A 1 jici'l inn uv t (I (11 i:mi lllllIlllA.il yesterday if Dr. Yount wished serve.

Club Again Considers Factory Funds. The Commercial Club last night de termined to undertake to secure the charter of the Cape Girardeau Coun ty Fair and Park Association and man age a county fair at the new city Fair grounds Park next fall. An offer of $l"00 for the use of the city park as a temporary fairgrounds has been n ado to Mayor Kage by a representa tive of the club and the Mayor has in d'eated his willingness to accept the offer. The Commercial Club last night named a committee to take charge of the work looking toward the club's county fair venture. The Fair Com- ro Halted By 

NORMAL TO GET Ghost of Woman; Stones The Spook Charley Brassfield Says He also saw Phantom Dog and Relates Tale of Spirit Horse's Head. Ghosts of men and women and ani mals have been seen flitting up and down the Bend road, a few miles north of this city, during the past two weeks, and night traffic over that highway has been suspended by the colored residents and suspicious white folks. The last vision was that of a wom an, clad in a flowing robe of white, and it made its appearance near the site of the old Houck mill, hardly two miles from the Cape. Ai cording to those who have en countered the ghosts, they promenade only on dark nights when the rain is falling. Charley Brassfield, a colored newspaper pressman, who had always wanted to be introduced to a ghost on a dark evening, had his longing grati fied early last Monday morning. He was returning from a 'possum hunt out on the Bend road. He va.; alone,

In the coherence. Mr. Tmsloy told ; lars the Mayor that certain alterations will be made in the plans for laying the pines in t Ji Normal School district which will alunv the speedy start of the work. The commencement of the pipe laying has been retarded by the fact that easements or rights of way across all the property to be dug up have not been obtained by the city. When the new franchise for the wa ter and light company was passed about three years ago, it provided for a high pressure water service system on the Normal School hill that would a J afford ample protection for the Nor mal buildings in the event a fire should break out.

The Weasts were preparing tc retire shortly before 1) o'clock when a neigh bor rang the front door bell and in- j formed them that the shop was burn ing. Mr. Weast understood the in former to say that the Weast home iwas ablaze and hejmrried his family out of the building. j The carpenter shop, which is a one story building, was virtually reduced I to ashes, contained valuable carpenter i tools, planing mill and manv imple ments used by the builder.

Mr. Weast said, and on this amount he carried 500 insurance, part of which was on the building. No oil or gasoline was stored in the building. ?Ir.

THE GERMAN-AMERICAN AND DISLOYALTY. The pointed insinuation in President Wilson's message to Congress that the German-Americans are disloyal to the United States, is unfair and un varrantcd because it is not true. The average German-American is no different from any normal man. no matter what his nationality may be. It is true that there are undersirables among them just as there are undesirables among any race or set of men. 'iit the mere fact that one man of German lineage is a criminal docs not iistify anyone in condemning the whole race. The European war has aroused the people, not only in this nation, but i l every land, and it is not unnatural that it should. It is to be expected that those of German nationality should be partial to the country of their i.fctivity, just as the Englishman or Frenchmen are and should be to their i:Htivo heaths. It is true that acts of disloyalty have been committed, but these only involved a few. It is therefore, an injustice to blame all for the wrong doings of a clique. Those who deserve censure or punishment should g't it rim those who do-not. should not be humiliated. It is just as unfair to hold all of the German-Americans to account for he improjier actions of a few, as it would be to prosecute a whole fa mil v, ' son troes a straw Kvcrvhrwlv nn mutt.- u-i.. u;rt 1 i: yi t i ,1 i;t h..,. h k! v 7 , , ,u,l'u'm"l and the funeral will be at Brazeau this ,s P001' unl'' h or riw has been proven bad, and the transgressions of one afternoon man cannot make another bad. i .... . i i , , , 31 lifter was working in the fields at President Wilson would have made more friends had he merely asked his farn1 whcn wh wUh f (ingress to enact law to punish Amencans who are disloyal, because they ' ral da , He WM t k J0 should lie pushed no mat er where they were born anil without regard for his honie atu, eventuav b ht t th(. .e nationality of their antecedents By ,,ngling out an especial race, hejc to the ho iu, ' A - . merely joins hands with Roosevelt and Bryan. was adviwf, t(J saye h;, Kfeut h? - refused ermission for several days.

He told the Mayor that if the water and light company will make the change in their I plans necessary to avoid the destruc tion of his property, the easement will be signed and filed with the city im- ! mediately.

When Mr. McPherson was asked if he could serve as secretary of the club last night, he declared he was unable to give a definite answer. Mr. Mc Pherson has land interests in Arkan sas, and at the time he retired from pay- third and raise the shoe factory roll by about $2500 weekly. Some of the kinds of materials that will have to be used in the construc tion of the addit'on could not be priced on short notice, Worcester said, but jifter a preliminary examination of thc job he said it would cost .S25.000 f5 active business in the Cape, it was said j t the most and he declared that th that he had planned to return to At kansas or Memphis to look after his interest there. In an address that he made liefore the club, 3Ir. McPherson indicated that it is quite probable that he will ar range his affairs to remain in the Cape arid be able to accept the position. A committee was appointed to consult with 3IcPherson in an endeavor to ob tain his services.
