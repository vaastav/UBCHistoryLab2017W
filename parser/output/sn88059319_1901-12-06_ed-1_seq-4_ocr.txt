He urges that the preaching or teaching of anarchy be not permitted, and requests congress to enact legislation that will Ianding irevent anarchists from foreign countries upon our shores. He would also have trie federal courts given jurisdiction over any man who kills, or attempts to kill, the president of the country, or any person who is in line for succession to the presidency. He has no fear, however, that the country will ever fall Into an- line of succession for the presidency, While the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our in stitutions. Anarchv Is a crime against the whole human race, and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of cations, like piracy and that form of man Stealing known as the slave trade, for it Is of far blacker Infamy than either. It should be so declared by treaties among ail civilized powers. Such treaties would Bive to the federal government the power pf dealing with the crime." The Trusts. The ©resident sees cause for congratu lation wr the nation in the business condi tions of the present, but sees in the "tre mendous and highly complex industrial development whim went on with ever ac celerated rapidity curing the latter half of the nineteenth century gerlous social problem for the present and future. He does not believe that the old laws and old customs are sufficient to regulate the ac cumulation and distribution of wealth of the present time. He does not attribute the creation of great corporate fortunes to tlie existence of a protective turlff. "nor to any other governmental-action, but to natural cause* jn the business world, op erating In other countries as they operate in our own." Jn this connection he says: "The process has aroused much antago nism, a great part of which is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never be forp has the average man, the wage worker, the iarmer, the small trader, been so -well oft as in this country and at the present Um?. There have been abuses roniitcled with the accumulation of wealth, yet It remains true that a for tune accumulated In legitimate business can be accumulates by the person spe cially btne/ited only on condition of con ferring immense incidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise ot flie type which benefits all mankind can only ex ist If the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of success." But while he realizes existing condi tions. he emphasizes the fact thatcongreHS In providing remedies must act with cau tion, fle the men and corporations "who have built up our commerce and driven our railroads across the continent have done great good to our people, flnd without pered as is compatible with the public whom lVhpWfl4iir'pesr,nf.

Another reason for caution in trust legis lation which he gives "Is to be found in the international commercial conditions of to day.

WKJL a tr*** jMS +f*U LT TO CO Sends His First Annual Message to the Senate and House of Representatives. Xbc following is a comprehensive sum mary of President Roosevelt's message to oongrefis: MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ON IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. Eulogizes the^Late President McKinley and Advocates Stern Measures for Anarchists—Proposes Trust Legislation Along the Lines of Pub licity—Favors Government Construction of Irrigation Works- Urges Construction of Isthmian Canal and Laying of Pa cific Cable—Asks Legislation for the Colonies and The president begins his first annual communication with an official announce ment of the death of the late President McKinley, and a eulogy of his former chief in which he says: "It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley's death he was the most widely-loved man in all the United States, while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter ani mosities incident to public life. His po litical ^opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the •weetness and gentleness of character srhlch so endeared him to his close asso ciates. To a standard of lofty Integrity In public life he united the tender affec tions and home virtues which are all important in the makeup of national character. A gallant soldier in the great .'war for the union, he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relations. There could be no personal hatred of him, for he never act ed with aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to feffpect him who knew him in public or private life. The defenders of those mur derous criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is exer cised for political ends inveigh against (wealth ana irresponsible power. But for Ithis assassination even this base apology pannot be urged." "The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all who saw the dark days while the president yet hovered between life and death. At last the light •was stilled in the kindly eyes, and the breath went from the Hps that even In mortal agony uttered no words save of lorgWeness to his murderer, of love for hie friends and of unfaltering trust in the prill of the Most High. Such a death crowning the glory of such a life leaves us with Infinite sorrow, but with such pride in what he had accomplished and in Reciprocity for Cuba—Would Exclude Chinese. £W /*, ,4 ,-4f ," As a remedy lor these evils he aaya: "The first essential In determining how to deal with the great Industrial com binations is knowledge of the facta— publicity. In the Interest of the public the government should have the right to Inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged In Inter state business. Publicity is the only surf! remedy which we can now Invoke, What further remedies are needed In the way of governmental regulation or taxation oan only be determined after publicity has been obtained by process of law and In the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and complete, —knowledge which may be made public to the worl'l. *r.?™fr" ,, I conservative a state as Massachusetts In The federal courts should be given Jur- order to produce excellent results." lsdictlon over any man who kills or at- "jhe president believes that It will be tempts to kill the president or any min possible to secure the needed remedies Artificial bodies, such aa corporations and joint stock or other aaaoclatlona de pending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should bt subject to proper governmental supervision, and full and accurate Information as to their operations should be made public regu larly at reasonable Intervals." "The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized In one state, always do business In many states, often doing very little business In the state where they are incorporated. There Is utter lack of uniformity in the state laws about them, and as no stata frM any exoluslve interest In or power over their acts it has in practice proved Im possible to get adequate regulation through state action. Therefore In the Interest of the whole people the nation should, without interfering with the pow er of the states In the matter Itself, also assume power ot supervision and regula tion over all corporations doing an Inter, state business. This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency In ita business. There would be no hardship in such supervision. Banks are subject to it, and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed it Is probable that supervision of corpora' tlons by the national government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised ........ —.over them by so for .The trust evil under the constitution as it now exists, but if congress think) otherwise lie recommends that a constitu tional amendment be subm tted that will COT fer the po necessary.

Would Exclude the Chinese. The message oouiains a strong room mendatlon for li reenactment at' ojiqi of the present Chinese exclusion act. In which connection he says: "Wages are higher to-day in the United States than ever before in our history and far higher than in any other coun try. The standard of living is also higher than ever before. Every effort of legis lator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this condition of things and ita improvement wherever possible. Not only must our labor be ga rotected by the tarlfT, but It should also protected so far as it Is possible from the presence in this country of any la borers brought over by contract or of those who, comins freely, yet represent a standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our rneu iij the labor market and drag them to a lower le.vff. I regard it as necessary, with this end in view, to reenact immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever necessary In or der to make its enforcement entirely tl fectlve." He also recommends such legislation, by an amendment to the interstate commerce law. as will protect the labor of one state from competing with the prison labor of another state, and also that the govern1 ment cease being a parly to this compete tion by not purchasing goods made either by convict labor or that In which women and children are caused to work excesaiva hours or at night. In the labor unions of the present he sees much that is good, in which connection he says: "Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wageworkers when managed with forethought and when they combine In sistence upon their owp rights with law abiding respect for the rights of others. tnan me usuunuum them the material development fit which Finally there mutt also In many cases ba A AOA an 11»ut 1V np/tiifl simil/t naiinw I ai pre we so Justly proud could never ijave action by the government In order to taken place.

Remedial (or the Trnat Krril. But while he says the above la true, ha yet sees many evils lor which there shoula be remedies provided1. Ot th«»» evils the chief Is over capitalization, "bacauaa oi Its many baleful consequences." lie soya: "The conviction ef the American people that the great corporations, known ca trusts, are In certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare, Is based upon sincere conviction that com bination and concentration should be not prohibited, but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled, and In my Judgment this conviction is right."

This would step the Influx of cheap labor and the resulting competition which gives rise to so much of bitterness in American Industrial life, and it would dry up the springs of the pestilential social conditions in our great cities where an archistic organisation* have their great est possibility of growth." The Tariff. The president does not desire any change In the present tariff schedule except where auch may be made In reciprocity treaties, and recommends the adoption of reciproc ity traatlaa and the general polley of reci procity as a means of opening the doors of 'oreign nations to our commerce, in which connection he says: "Every application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the joint that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wageworker Is a prime conald aration of our entire policy of economlo legislation. ''Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our Industrial well being at home the principle of reci procity must command our hF-arty sup port. The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a lib eral policy In dealing with foreign na tions. Whatever la merely petty and vex- I atleus In the way of trade restrictions should ba avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products I In the long run directly or indirectly pur chase those surplus products by giving ua something in return. Their ability to pur- chase our products should as far as pos sibl* be secured by so arranging our tar iff as to enable us to take from them these products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. Tha natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with those of our productions which no longer require all of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound The president pronounces our merchant marine "discreditable to us as a nation and insignificant to that of other nations which wt overtop In other forms of business,' and says we "should not longer submit to conditions-under which only a trifling lior tion of our great commerce is carried in our own ships. Of this he says: "To remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build up our shipping in terests. but It would also result in benefit to all who are interested In the perma nent establishment ef a wider market for American products and would provide an auxiliary force for the ravy. Ships work for their own countries just as railroads work for their terminal points. Shipping lints, if fFtablished to the principal couni tries with which we have dealings, would ba of political as well ai commercial ben-* eflt. From every standpoint It Is unwise for the United State* to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for the distribution of ou goods. It should be made advantageous to carry American goods In American built ships." His recommendation on this subject is onlv that "our government should take such action as will remedy these inequali ties. The American merchant marine should be restored lo the ocean." PI nances. which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit of our actual needs." He urges the necessity for strict economy In expenditures, but that "our national needs forbid us to be niggardly In the mat ter of providing whatever Is actually nec essary to our well-being." Inter-Stnte Commerce. Agricultural Interests. The president cites tlie fWest legislation of the past and the great good of forest preserves to the people, and says they will inevitably be of still greater value. Con tinuing, he says: "At present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the general land office, the mapping and description of their tim ber wltn the United States geological sur vey and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with the bureau of for estry, which is also charged with the gen eral advancement of practical forestry in the United States. These various func tions should be united In the bureau oi forestry, to which they properly belorff. The present diffusion of responsibility 1« bad from every standpoint.

In which connection he says "we need every honiast and ef ficient immigrant fitted to become an American citizen, every jtafnlgranf who comes here to stay, who brings h^rei ft strong body, a good head and a resolute purpose to do his duty well In every way and to bring up his children as law-abiding. Gpd-fearlng members of the community." But )ie says: "There should be a comprehenslvo law enacted With the objoct of working a threefold improvement over pur present system. First, we should aim' ft) exclude absolutely not only all persona iy)io aR knows to be believers In anarchistic prln* clplfi or members of anarchistic socie ties, but also all porsons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory repu tation. This means t'uat we should re quire a more thorough system of inspec. trn abroad and a more rigid sys'tom pjf exammst'on at our Immigration ports, tlie toi'mer being especially necessary. "The seoond objetft of a proper Immi gration law ought to be to secure by careful and not merely perfunotory edu cational test some intelligent capaolty to appreciate American institutions and act tanely as American citizens. This would rat keep out all anarchists, for many of thfim belong to the Intelligent criminal class, but It would do what is alio In poip-t •—that Is, tend to decrease the sum of Igr norauce so potent In produolng the envy, suspicion, maligna*! passion and hatred of orger out of which anarchistic senti ment Inevitably springs.

I ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor." The Merchant Marine. Under this heading the president recom mends such ltglslation as will better safe guard against the deranging influences of commercial criscs and financial panics and such as will make the currency of the country more responsive to the demands of domestic trade and commerce. ,j, w- He points to defects In the Interstate commerce law. ar.d recommends amend ments to correct them, in which connection ha says: "Those who complain of the management of the railways allege that established r^tes are not maintained, that re bates and similar devices are habitually resorted to, that these preferences are usually in favor of the large shipper, that they drive out of business the smaller competitor, that while many rates are too low many others are excessive and that gross preferences are made affecting both localities and commodities. Upon the oth er hand, the railways assert that the law by Its very terms tends to produce many of these illegal practices by depriving car riers of that right of concerted action which they claim is necessary to estab sh and maintain nondiscriminating rates. "The act should be amended. The rail way is a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to it that within Its Jurisdiction this is so and should provide a speedy, inexpensive and effective ^remedy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblocd of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the develop ment and operation of these commercial agencies."

"The forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of tha arid region. Great storage works are nec fc»#»ry to equalize the flow of streams and to save Ihtf flpo4 waters. Their construc tion has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast for private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the in dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching interstate problems are involved, and the resources of single states would often be inadequate. It is properly a national function, at least In BOine of Its features. It is as right for the national government to maka the streams and rivers of tho arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as to make useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineering works of another kind. The storing of the floods in reservoirs at the headwaters of our rivers is but an en largement of our present policy of river control undef frfiloh levees are built on the lower reaches of the same streams.

"The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country, Just as the settlement of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought pros perity to the Atlantic states. The in creased demand for manufactured arti cles will stimulate industrial production, while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will consume the larger food sup plies and effectually prevent western competition with eastern agriculture. In deed. the products of Irrigation will ba consumed chiefly In upbuilding local cen ters of mining and other Industries which would otherwise not come into existence at all. Our people as a whole will profit, for successful homemaklng is but anptbar name for the upbuilding of the nation." He counsels against attempting too much at the beginning, but advises that we let tldrs at the weat ere attempting to build heniea an these arid iandf, and cays: "The seeurlty and value of the homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water, but the majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation ot eoHrt decisions rendered in ordinary suits at law. With a lew creditable exceptions, the arid statea have failed to provide for the certain and just division or streams in times of scarcity. I^ax and uncertain laws have made It po&sible to establish rfghts to water in excess of actual uses or ne cessities, and many stream* have already passed Fnto private ownership or a control equivalent to ownership. "Whoever controls stream practleelly controls the land it renders productive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water egjart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition of suoh ownership, which has bein per mitted to grow up In the arid regions, should give way to a more enlightened and larger recognition of the rights of the pub lic iji the control and disposal of the pub lic water supplies. Laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humid' regions, where water is too abundant to Justify hoarding It. have no proper application in a dry country. "In the arid state® the only right to water which should be recognized is that of use. the land reclaimed and be inseparable theretrom. Granting perpetual water rights to other than users without compensation to the public Is open to all the objections which apply to giving away perpetual franchises to the public utili ties of the cities. A few of the western states have already recognized this and have incorporated in their constitutions the doctrine of perpetual state ownership of water." The Colonics. Considerable attention is given tha col onies, and especially the Philippines. This section of the message begins by citing the neeas of Hawaii and Porto Rico, of which he says: "In Hawaii cur aim must be to develop the territory on the traditional American lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms thry own. All our legislation for the Islands should be'shaped with this enc| in view. The well being of the average' hopiemaker must on cur homestead system." Of Porto Rico he says the Island is thriv ing as never before, and is being adminis tered efficiently and honestly. He deems no legislation necessary except that con cerning the public lands of the island. He calls attention to the fact that in Cuba the independent government of th« Island' will soon be in control, and in tha same connection urges strongly tha need of reciprocal trade relations with tha ntw nation, upon which subject he says: "In the case of Cuba there are weighty reasons of morality and of national Inter est why the policy should be held to have a. peculiar application, and I most earnest ly ask your attention to the wisdom, lndee.d and we arc bound by every consid: eratlon of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures In the Interest of her ipaterlal well being." For th* Philippines he recommends much in the way of legislation, but again coun sels caution that we go neither too far nor with too great haste. He says: "We hope to make our administration of the islands honorable to our notion by making it of the highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves, and as an-earnest of what we Intend to do we point to what we have done. Already a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained in the Philippines than ever before in their his tory ." He say? we do not desire to do far ttm Islanders "merely what has elsawhera one fer tropic peoples by even the bwrt But the idea of the president is that wa cannot leave the islands at thiB time, of •which he says: "To leave the islands at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of njurderops anarchy.

But believes sufficient progress has been made along the lines under which we have- been working In the Islands to wai rant us In passing new legislation, but In this connection he urges the need of cau- ,, tion.

TJie connection betweS^ id'lene&s and mischief is proverbial, and the opportunity lo do remunerative work is one of the surest preventives of war. Of :ourse no business man will go Into the Philippines unless It Is to his interest to do so, ar.d it Is Immensely to the interest of the islands that he Bhould go in. It Is therefore necessary that the congress should pass laws by which the resources of the Islands can be developed, so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can be granted to companies doing business III them and every encouragement be given lo tfve incoming of business men of every kind. "Not to permit this is to do a wrong ta the Philippines. The franchises must be granted and the business permitted only und'er regulations which will guarantee the Islands against any kind of improper ex- to development which will surely follow will afford to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire (o §4dtji&ro«'' The construction of a Paoifio cable Is also urged, either that the government lay such a cable to connect Hawaii and the Philippines, or that an arrangement be made by which the advantages ac cruing from a government cable may be secured to the government by contract with a private cable company. This he deems necessary for both commeroial, political and military considerations. The Isthmian Canal, He calls "attention to the need of ttn isthmian canal, and says: "Its Importance to the nation Is by no means limited merely to its material ef fects upon our business prosperity, and yet with a view to these effects alone it would be to the last degree important for us immediately to begin it. While Its beneficial effects would perhaps be most marked upon the Pacific coast and the gulf and south Atlantic states, it would also greatly benefit other sections. It Is emphatically a work which it Is fer the interest of the entire country tq bfgip and oQ'mplete' as soon as possible It Is one of those great works which only a great nation can undertake with pros pects of success and which when done are not only permanent assets in the na tion's material Interests, but standing monuments to its constructive ability." Of the new treaty recently concluded with England he says: "I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotia tions on this subject with Groat Britain, cenducted on both sides In a spirit of friendliness and mutual good will and re spect, have resulted In my 'being able to lay before the senate a treaty which If ratified' will enable us to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time and which guarantees to tills nation every right that It has ever a&ked In connection with the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as ln idequate to supply the base for the con struction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, Is abrogated. It spe cially provides that the United States alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms' of equality without the guarantee or interference of anjr' outside "nation from any quar ter. The signed -treaty will at once be laid before the senate, iind if ap proved the congrcss can then proceed to .SUtfi atTMt to tha ktXttiWM i«*. tu oy providing tot tin ounmni? ot xae •anal." The Monroe Doctrine. The president sets forth the objects of the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit in which it has been received by other countries, and In connection with it says this-nation has not the slightest desire to acquire any territory at the expense of any of our neighbors, and cites our atti tude toward Cuba aa a guarantee of our rood faith. He sax *,s0 that "this doctrine has nothing to do with tha com mercial relations of any American power save that It In truth allows each ef them to form such as it desires." That "we do not ask for any exoluslve cotomerolal treaty with any other American state." He says of this: "The Monrot doctrine should be tfta cardinal feature of the foreign peMcy oi of tha two Ametteaa all the nations of It la ef the United States, have Mesed since President Just Tt yean vaesed since President He*res la his asMal message announced that 'tbe American continents are henceforth aot to be considered as subjeots for future colonisation by any European power.' In other words, the Monroe dootrlne Is a declaration that there must be no terri torial aggrandizement by any non-Ameri ean power at the expense of any Ameri can pewer an American soli. It Is in no wise intended as hostile to any nation In the old world. Still less is it intended to give cover to any aggression by one new werld power at the expense of any other. It Is simply a step, and & long step, to- ward assuring the universal peaoe of the world by securing the possibility of per manent peace on this hemlaphere." The Navy. The president urges the continued up building of the navy as a means of per forming our International duties as well aa a protection and safeguard for our inter national rights. He urfes that our place as a Aret-claas power necessitates the building and maintenance of a navy la keeping with our place among tha nations of the world, and says: "Po far from being In any way a provo cation to war, an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guarantee against war, the el insurance. war, the cheapest and most effective peace main ,r ..j very lightest premium for insuring peace which 4 I «tnn 

VIASAIKIV VtA The cost of building and talnlng such a nary represents tha ver lightest premram for Insuring this nation can possibly pay.' He recommends both the construction of more ships and the addition of mora officers and men as absolutely necessary, and says: "There should be no cessation in the •work of completing »r navy. So far in genuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great war craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas. It ta unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several addi tional battleships and heavy axmored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion. For the exact number and character I refer yeu ts the report of the secretary of the navy. But there is some thing we need even more than additional ships, and this Is additional officers and men. To provide battleships and cruis ers and then lay them up, with the ex tlon of leaving them unmanned un ... ...ey are needed in actual war, would be worse than felly. It weuld be a crime pnotation of leaving them unmanned un til thi be wo against Che natlen. "Tq send any warship against a oompe- iism ent'enemy unless th»ae aboard it have trained by years at actual sea serv ice, including Incessant gunnery prac tloe, would ha to lnvtts not merely Sis- aster, but tha bitterest shame and humil iation. Four thousand additional sea men and a thousand additional marines should be provided, and an Increase in th'e officers should be provided by making a large addition to the classes at Annfip olls. There Is one small matter which should be mentioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmean ing title of 'naval cadet' should be abol ished: the title of "midshipman,' full ot historic association, should be restored. "We now have 17 battleships appropri-. Snd ted for, ef which nine are completed have been commissioned for actual service. The remaining eight will be ready in from two to four years, but it will take at least that time to recruit at^f) train the men to fight them. It 1b ef vast concern that wa have trained crews ready for the vessels by the time they are com missioned. Good shlpB and good guns are simply good weapons, and the best weapons are useless save In the hands of men who know how to fight with them. Tne men must be trained and drilled un der a thorough and well-planned system pf progressive Instruction, while the re cruiting must be carried on with still greater vigor. Every effort must be made to exact the main function of the' officer— the command of men. The leading grad uates of the naval academy should be as signed to tha combatant branches, tha line and marines." Tlie Army, No increase In the regular army is deemed necessary at this time, but thue are several changes in that branch of the government service which the president recommends to congress. Chief of the.® is the establishment of a staff department, and of this he says: "Jif general Staff should ba created. As for the general staff ar.d supply depart^ ing after awhile to their line duties. It very undesirable to have the senior grades of the army composed ot men who have come to fill the positions the mere fact of seniority. jV ta.?p,.„rv thi nnnnrtnnitv Th® mufit he thrflwii !fL°.!*l0 i.r® Pr«cnDea tn aayance. it is ut- I I is needed by the departments ot laws dealing^with general transportation.

When on actual service, nQ prises. Nothing would bftnent tnc-iri ao work save that directly In the line of such seryipe should be required. The paper work In the army, as In the navy, should be greatly reduced. What Is needed is proved power of command ar.d capacity to work well In the field. Constant tare is necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and commissary depart ments." He also urges the enactment of legis lation in connection with the militia and national guard forces of the nutibn that they may bo batter' fitted for active serv ioa tn tima of war, and says: "Our militia law Is obsolete and worth less. Tha organization and armament of the national guard of the several states which ara treated aa militia in the ap propriations by the oongress, should be made identical with those provided for the. regular forces.

His rec ommendation for this is as follows: "I recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified service to tha District of Columbia or will at least enable the president thus to extend it. In my Judgment all laws providing for tha temporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision that they be seleoted under the civil service law." He also wishes the merit system to ob tain in the government service in the colonies, and sayB: "Not an Office should be filled in tha Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard to the man's partisan affiliations or serv ices, with any regard to the political, SO' ewvo, l.lUi IU UiQ pUlIUCtll, SO- clal the man's own character and capacity VS3* Tn Mia recommend^ erMKing trp the tflVal funds, putting a stop to the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease their allot ments and stopping the ration system.

He recommends liberal appropriations for the Louisiana Purchase exposition and an appropriation covering expenses incurred by the Charleston exposition In romovlnr government exhibits from the Buffalo ex position to that at Charleston. Another of his recommendations is fer a permanent census bureau, as it would In sure better, cheaper and more satisfactory work In the Interest of business, statistics. eoonomlc and social selence. The Postal Service. H-e ealls attention to the growth jof the postal system and to the fact that the an Baal deficit in this department of the gov ernment serriee has been reduced to the small sum of 5,924,72*. Th»s, he says, could further be increased and posBlbly a surplus shown but for the fact that many publi cations are now securing the pound rate as second-class mall matter which are not entitled to the same under the law. Of thistle says: 'T'he full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the government through the intrenched and well-under stood abuses which have grown lrt con nection with second-class mail matter. The extent of this borden appears when ft is stated that, while the second-olass mat tar makes nearly three-flfths of tha weight of all the mall. It paid for the last fiscal year only $4,294,445 Of the aggregate postal revenue of 1111,631,198. If the pound rate of postage, which produces the large loss thus entailed and which was fixed oy the congress with the purpose of encouraging the dissemination of public Information, tvere limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law, ne Just exception could be taken. That expense would be the recognized and acoepted cost of a liberal public policy de liberately adopted for a justifiable end. But much of the matter which enjeys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the intent of the law and has secured admis sion only through an evasion of its re quirements or through lax construction. The proportion of such wrongly Included matter Is estimated by postal experts to be^ne-half of the whole volume pf second olass mall. If It be only one-third or one quarter, the magnitude of the burden Is apparent. The post office department has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as possible by a stricter application of the law, and it should be sustained ia its effort." Tlie Chinese Difficulties. He calls attention to the satisfactory settlement of the Chinese difficulties of last year, and this nation's part in the settlement, and says provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign representatives. Of th4 promises made by China he says "The Chinese government has agreed to ?erlng iarticipate financially in the work of bet the water approaches to Shanghai ?radeto .nd Tientsin, the centers of foreign In central and northern China, and an international conservanoy board, in which the Chinese government is largely In conclusion, he mentions the Pan American r.nsress. now In session at tha City of Mexico, and refers to the d*ath of Queen Victoria and the dowager empress or Germany, which aroused the genuine sympathy of the people of this country, which sympathy was fully reciprocated by th? people of both these nations upon the assassination of President McKinley.
