Omoe, on St. Clair Street, next to tbe old Rail The President's Message. Fellow O'firfn of thf Semite and House of littpretentatirci : Sine your last animal assembling, iu other yonr of health nnJ bountiful harvests lias passed ; amV while it ha not pleased the Almighty to Mcb tin with a return of peace, ve can but press on, guided by the best light IU gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wiso wnv, all will be well. The. correspondence touching foreign affairs, whirh lias taken place during the last year, is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request to that effect, mode by the House of Keprvacutativeit, near the elotte oi the last srbsion of Con gress. If the condition of our relation with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distressed as we are might rea sonably have apprehended. In the mouth ot Juno last, thero were some grounds to expect that the maratimo Towers, w hich, at the beginning of our domestic difficulties, so unanimously and unnecessarily, as we think, recognized the insurgents nsa bellig erent, would soon recede from that position, which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country ; but the temporary reverses which afterward befol the national arinH, and which were exaggera'ed by our own disloyal children abroad, havo hitherto delayud that act of simple justice. The civil war which has so radically changed for the moment tho occupations and habits of the Amoricar. people, has nec essarily disturbed the social conditions hi id uffected very deeply tho prosperity of the n.UioiiH with which we have carried on a coniincrco that has boon steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. It has at the same time excited political am bitions and apprehensions, which have pro duced a profound agitation throughout tho civilized world. In this unusual agitation, wo have forlnrno from taking part in any controversy between foreign States and between parties or factions in such Slates. We have uttemptud no. propugandism, and acknowledged no revolution ; but we have left to every nation tho exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs. Our strugglo has been, of course, contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to itn supposed and ol'ton exaggerated effects, and the consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nev ertheless, complaint on the part of this Government, even if it were just, would certainly bo unwise. Tho treaty with Great Britain for the sup pression of tho African slave trade, has been put into operation, with a good pros pect of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasuro to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of Her Majesty's Government has boon marked h,V l) Jealous respect for tho authority of the United States, and tho rights of their moral mid loyul citizens. The' Convention with Hanover for the abolition of theStado dues has been carried into full effect undo! the act of Congress for that pu. ose. A blockade f thrTo thousand miles of seacoast could not bo established and vig orously enforced, in a season of great com mercial activity like the present, without committing occasional mistakes and inflict ing unintentional injuries upon foreign na tions and thoir sulijects. A civil war oc curring in a country where foreigners resido and carry on trade, under treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of com plaints of the violations of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite misappre hensions, and possibly, to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peaco und trieiidship. In clear cases ol tneso Kituis, 1 have, so far as possible, heard and re dressed complaints which have been pre sented bv friendly Powers. There is, how ever, a large and augmenting number of doubtful cases, upon which the Govern ment is unable to agree with the govern ments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are. moreover, many cases in whicli tho United States or their citinens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authotities ot foreign nations, which tho governments of these States are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign States thus interested, mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. This proposi tion lias been mauo especially to tjreat Britain, to Franco, to Spain, nnd to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but has not vet been formally adopted. 1 deem it my duty to recommend an appro priation in behalf of the owners of the .Norwegian bark Admiral 1. rontons Kiolu, which vsscl was, in May, liJ61, preverted by the commander of tho blockading force off Charleston from leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an hng lish vessel. I have directed tho Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to tho proper committees. Applications have been made to me by many free Americans of African descent to favor their emigration with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in re cent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad, some from interested mo tives, others upon patriotic considerations, and still others influenced by philui.thropic HoutinentH, have suggested similar meas ures; while, ou the other hand, several of the Spanish Anierican Republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these circum stances I have declined to move anv such inlony to any State without first obtaining tho consent of its Government, with mi agreement on its part to receive and pro tect such emigrants in alt their rights us freemen ; and I have at tho same lime of fered to the several .Stutes situated in the tropics, or having colonies there, to nego tiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that clnRS to their respective territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just and humane. Liberia and llayti are as yet the only countries to which colonists of African de scent from hero cotiU' go with certainty of being received aud adopted as citizens ; and I regret to say that such persons -contemplating colonization do not seuin so willing to emigrate to those countries as to some others, nor so willing as I think their inter est demands. I believe, however, the opinion among them iu this respect is im proving, and that erelong there will be an augmented and considerable emigration to both these countries from tho United States. 1 The new commercial treaty between the United States aud the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution. . A coiiunorcial and consular treaty has been negot:uted, subject to tho Senate's consent, with Libe ria, and a similar negotiation is now pend ing with the Republic of Hayti. A consid erable Improvement of the national com merce is expected to result from these measure. Our relations with Greut Britain rruc, Spain. Portugal, liiisxia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Nether- Undtf, Italy, Rome, and the oilr RuToptati States, remain undisturbed. Very favora ble relations lo coutlune to bo nniirutained with Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan, luring the last year thero has not only been no change of our previous relation's with the independent States of our own conti nent, but more friendly sentiments than havo heretofore existed sre believed to be entertained by theso neighbors, w hose safety and progress are su intimately con nected with our own. This statement spe cially applie to Mexico, Costa Kica, Nica ragua, Honduras, Peru and Chili. Tho Commission under tho Convention with the Republic of New Granada, closed its ses sion without having audited and passed upon all the claims which were submitted to it. A proposition is pending to revive the Convention, that it mav bo ablo to do more complete justice. 'I he Commission between the United StateR and tho liepublio of Costa Rica has completed its labors and submitted its report. 1 have favored the project for connecting tho United Slate with Europe by an Atlantic Telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from Sun Francisco, to connect by a Pacific Telegraph wilh tho wire which is being extended across the flussian Kmpire. The Territories of the United Htates, with unimportant exceptions, have remained un disturbed by the rivit war, and thev are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some ot tiicm will soon lie in a condition to lie organized as States, and be constitutionally admitted into the Union. Tho Immense mineral re sources of some of these Territories ought to no developed as rapidly as possible, l....v. ....... :..i....l: : . ill i..uij m., in mm uuruiuTi tiiim imvii a tendency to improve thp revenues of the Government, and diminish tho burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted, The moans which suggests itself as most likely to bo effective, is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in theso territories, with a view to tho publication of its results at home and in foreign coun triesresults whicli cannot fail to bo auspicious. Tho condition ol tho finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppres sion of the rebellion, have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unu sual in similar circumstances, and tho pub lic credit lm been fully maintained. The continuance of tho war", however, and the incroased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field. demand your beRt rellections, as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenues without injury to business, and with tho least possible burdens upon labor. Tho suspension of specie iiavineutd bv the batiks, soon after the commencement of your last session, made large issues of Uni ted rstatcs notes invodabh. fn no other way could tho payment of tho troops, and the satisfaction of other just demands, bo so economically or us well provided for. Tho judicious legislation of Congress, se curing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties, and making them a ' lt't;;il tender " fur other debts has made them universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at least, and for tho time, the long felt want of an uniform circulating medi um, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts aud exchanges. A return to Bjiecio payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests, should ever bo kept iu view. Fluctuations in the value of currency aro always injurious, and to reduoo these fluc tuations to tho lowest possible point will always he a leading purpose iu wiso legis lation. Convertibility, prompt and certain, convertibility into ooln, is generally ac knowledged to be the best aud surest safe guard against them, and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of I nited tates notes, payable iu coin, and sutli- ciently large for the wants of the people, can bo permanently, usefully, and safely maintained. Is there then any other mode iu which the necessary provision lor the public wants can be mudo, and the gnat advanta ge of a safe and uniform currency secured ? I know of none which promises so certain results, and at the sanio time so unobjec tionable, as tho organization of banking associations under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. I o such associations the Government might furnish circulating notes qn (Itp security of United States bonds, deposited in the Treasury. Theso notes, prepared under tho super vision of proper officers, being uniform in appearance and security, and convertible always into coin, would at once protect lu bor against the evils of a vicious currency, and facilitate commoice by cheap and sale exchanges. A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compen sate tho United States for tho (.reparation and distribution of the notes, and a general supervision of the syhtem.and would lighten tho burden of that part of tho public debt employed as security. The public credit, moreover, would bo greatly improved, and the negotiations of new loans greatly facil itated by the steady murket demand for Gov ernment bonds, which the adoption of tho proposed system would create. It is an additional recommendation of tho measure, ot considerable weight iu my judgment, that it would reconcile, as far as possible, all existing interests, by the opportunity of fered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for tho local uud various circulation, secured and unse cured, now issued by them. The receipts into the Treasury from all sources, including lonps and balance from the preceding your, for the usual year end. ing ou the 'Kith of June, 18C2, were S.'iS.'f,-fcaii.2-17 06, of which sum 9.(i:C,397 02 were derived from customs j 1 ,79.',2.tl "3 from the direct tax ; from public lund.il fi2, 203 77 ; from miscellaneous sources, $331,- H7 01 j from loans in all forms, 8")2,J,0,J2,- 460 Ml. The remainder. 2.2.7,O05 &0 was the balance from last year. The disburse ments during tho same period were : For Congressional, Executive aud Judicial pur poses, SA,939,0C9 29 ; for foreign intercourse, fcl. 339.710 35 ; for miscellaneous expenses, including the Mints, Loans, Post-Ullice defi ciencies, collections of rovenue and other like charge, $14,129,771 50; for expenses under the Interior Department, 83,102,085 52 under tho War Department, 8394,308.407 30; under tho Navy Department. 842,074.569 09; for interest on the public debt, 13,190, 324 45, and Mr the payment of the public debt, including reimbursement of temporary loan and redemptions, 896.096.922,09; making un aggregate of 8579,841,700 25, and leaving a balance in the Treasury on tho 1st day of July, 1862, of 813,043,546 81. It should be observed that the sum of 896,. 096,922 09, expended for reimbursement and redemption of the publio debt, being included also in the loans made, may be properly deducted both from the receipt and expei diture, leaving the actual re ceipts for the vear 8487,788,324 97. and the expenditures '8174,744,788 16. Other in formation on the subject of the finance will bo fonnd in the Report of the Secretary of . the Treasury, to whose statement and 1 view I iuvito yeur most candid ud con xiderato attention. - . The Reports of the Secretaries of the Navy and Var sr herewith transmitted. These Reports, though lengthy, are scare ly tr.ore than biief abstracts of the very nu merous and extensive transactions" and operations conducted through these Depmt tneiits, nor could I give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the Reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the Reports before you, mid asking your attention to them. It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement iu the tinancial condition of the Post-OfhVe Hepartinctit as compared with several preceding veins. The receipts for the fiscal vear IN'I amounted to SS.'USt, 2'.iG 10, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three quarters of that year. Not withstanding the cessa tion of revenue from the so-called Seceded Slates during the lust liscnl year, the in crease of the correspondence of the loyal Slates has been Hiiftlcieut to produce a rev enue during the same year of rt,251!.8'Jtl 00, being onlv S.iO.000 less than -vus derived fuuii all the States of tbe Union during the previous year. Tho expenditures show a sun more tavoruiilu result. I he amount expended in ltii."l was i:i.C0ll,.() 11. For the last year the amount has been reduced to 8ll,12.i,;iti4 13, showing a decrease of about $2,.181 ,000 in the expenditures as com pared with the preceding year, and about SH. 750,000 as compared with the fiscal year IHt'.O. The deficiency in the Pepartment for the previous year was g l.OMJtiti JS. For the last h.ieal vear it was reduced to 82.112.- til i ri r it i. . ci-i ii. i nose lavoraiiie results are. in part, owing tu tho cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States, and in part to a casual review of all expenditures in that Department, in the interest of economy. Tho efficiency of tho Post.il servico it is be lieved has also been much improved. The Postmaster-General also opened a corres pondence, through Department of State, with foreign Governments, proposing a convention of Postal Representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of for eign postage aud to expedite tho foreign mails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commer cial interests of this country, has been fa vorably entortaiiie.d aud agreed to by all the Governments from whom replies have been received. I ask, the ntUmtiim of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General in his Report respecting tho further legislation required, iu his opinion, for the benelit of the postal service. The Secretary of tho Interior reports as follows in regard to the public lipids i "The Public Lands liivo coasi'd to bo u source of revenue. From the 1st of July, 1801, to the 30th of September, 1802, the entire cash receipts from the sale of lauds were S137.I70 20, a sum much less than Hie cx pense of our land system during the same period, The Homestead Law, which will take effect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to settlers that sales for cash cannot be expected to an extent suffi cient to moot the expenses ol the General La.id-Ofhce, and the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market. The disnrepnney between tho sum hero stated us arising from the sales of the pub lic lauds uud the same derived from the same source as reported from tho Treasury Department, arises, as 1 understand, from the fact that the periods of time though ap parently were not really coiin.iduiu at the beginning point, the Treasury Report, includ ing aooiisidcruhli; sum row which had pre viously been reported from the Interior suf ficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the threo months now re ported upon by the Interior, and not by thp Treasury. Tho Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, during the past year, manifested a spirit of insubordination, uud at several points have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vi cinity. The tribes oocupying the Indian country south of Kansas renounced their al legiance to the United Slates, and t'.nterod into treaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United States were driven from tho country. The Chcif of the Cherokees has visited this city for the pur pose of restoring the former relations of the tribo with tho United States. He al leges that they wcro constrained by supe? rior force to enter into treaties with the in surgents, and that tlio United States ne glected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required. Iu the month of August last the Sioux Indians, in Minnesota, attacked the settle ments iu tiiuir vicinity wilh extreme fe rocity, killing indiscriminately men, women and children. This attack was wholly un expected and, therefore, no means of defense had been provided. It is estimated that not less than 800 persons wore killed by the Indians, and a largo amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is not definitely known, anil sus picions, which may be unjust, need not be stated. Information was received by the Indian Bureau from different sources about tho time hostilities were commenced,' that a simultaneous attack was to be inado upon the white settlements by all the tribes be tween the Mississippi River aud the Rocky Mountains, The State of Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian wur. A large portion of her territory has been depopulated, uud a severe loss has been sustained bv the destruction of prop erty. The people, of the Statu manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of tho State us a guaranty against further hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details. I submit for your cspecu! consideration whether our Indian system shall not be remodeled. Many wise and good men have been impressed with tho belief that this can bo profitably done. I submit a statement of the proceedings of the Commissioners, which shows the progress that has been made in the enter prise of constructing the Pacific Railroad. and this suggests tho earliest completion of the road, and also tho favorable action ol Congress upon the projects now pending before thetq fqr onla.rj;itig tho capacities ol tho trrent canals iu New-York and Illinois, as being of vital and rupidly increasing im-1 portanceto tno wuoiu nation, aim especiuuj to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length. I propoio having prepared and laid beforo you at un early day some interesting aud valuable statistical information upon this subject. Tho military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigai Canal, and improving tho Illinois River, is presented in the report of Colonel Web ster to the Secretary of War, and now trans mitted to Congress. 1 respectfully ask at tention to it. To carry out the provision of the act of Congress of tue 15th of May 'ast. I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United Slates to be organized. The C-ommissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this Department has established an extensive system of corres pondence and exchange, both at home nnd abroad, which prom ses to fleet highly ben cficlul ics.dl in the development of u cor rect knowledge of racent improvements in agriculture, iu the introduction of new products, and in tho collection of the agri cultural stntiitics of the different States. Almi. thai it will soon U prepared to dis tribute largely seeds, cereals, plants, and cuttings, snd has already published and lib erally diffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report, whicli will iu due time bo furnished, em biacing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in tho laboratory. The creation of this Department was for the more imined ate benefit of a huge class of our most valuable citizens, and 1 trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been or ganized will not only meet your approba tion, but that it will realize" at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine Irionds, and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people. On the 'J2d day of September last, a pro clamation was issued by tho Kxocutive, a copy of which is herewith submitted. In accordance with the purposo expressed iu the second paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called "Compensated Emancipation." A nation may be said to consist of its terri tory, its people, aud its laws, The terri tory is the only part which is of certain durability. One generation passeth away and another generation eometh, but the earth uhidclli forever. It is of the fust im portance to duly consider and estimate thin ever-enduring part. That portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabit ed by the people ol tho United States is well adapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not well adapted for two or more, It vast extent and its variety of cli mate and production aro of advantage in this age for one people, whatever they might have been iu former ages. Steam and telegraphs, in intelligence, have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people. In my Inaugural Address, I briefly point ed out the total inadequacy of disunion us a remedy for the differences between tho peo ple of tho two sections. I did so iu lan guage which I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat: " One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to bo extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. Tho Fugitive Slave clausu of the Constitution and the law lor tho suppression ot the African slave-trade ure each as well eufoiood, per haps, as any law e&n ever be In u communi ty whore the moral sense of the people im perfectly supports tho law itself. Tho great body of the people abide by tho dry legal obligation iu both cases, and a few break over in each. This, 1 think, cannot bo perfectly cured, and it would bo worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before. Tho foreign slave trudo, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves now only partially surrendered, would not besurreiul ircd at all by the other. Physically speak ing, we cannot separate ; we cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may bo divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond tho reach ot each other, but the different parts of our country cannot do this, They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable, or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible, then, to make that in tercourse more advantageous or more satis factory alter separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws ? Can treaties bo more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws are among, friends? Snpposo you go to war, you cannot light always; and when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease lighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse ate again upon you," There is no line, straight or crooked, suit able for a mtiiuiul boundary upon which to divide, Trace through from east to west, upon tho line between the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than one-third of its length aro rivers easy to bo crossed, and populated, or soon to bo pop ulated, thickly upon both sides, while nearly all its remaining length aro merely surwyur'a lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any conscious ness of their presence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to puss by writing it down on paper or parchment us a national boundary, The fact of sepa ration, if it copies, gives up on the part of the sce'.ioiiul obligations upon the seceding section the Fugitive Slave clause, along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place, But there is another dilllculty. The great Ifitoriur region, bounded east by the Allcghahios, north by the British domin ions, west by tho Rocky mountains, and south by the line along which tho culture of corn and cotton meets, and which in cludes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all qf Kentucky, Ohio, Indiuna, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dacotah, Nebraska and part of Colorado, ha about ten millions of people anil will lmvo fifty uiillioUB within fifty years, if not prcvoiited by any political fully or mistake. It con tains moro than uno-third of tho country owned by tho United States certainly more than one million of square miles. If half as populous ns Massachusetts, already is, it would have more than seventy-five mil lions of people. A glance at the limp shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great lu.dy of the Republic. Tho other parts aro but marginal borders to it the magnificent region sloping west from tho Rocky mountains to the Pacific being the deepest uud also the richest in undeveloped resources. Ju the production of provis ions, grains, grasses, and all which pro ceed from them, this gi eat interior region is naturally one of tho most important iu the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small prupur.ion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and also tho largo and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with tho magnitude of the prospect presented j aud yet this region has no seacoast touches no ocean any where. As part of ono nation, its people now find, and may forover find, their WHy to Kuropo by New York, to South America and Africa by New Oi loans, and to Asia by San Francisco. But separate our common country into two nations, as designed by the present rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby out off from some ono or moro of these outlets, not, perhaps, by a physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trudo regula tions. And tk,is is true, wherever the bound ary lino may be fix d. Place it between tho now free and slave country, or place it south of Kentucky, or north of Ohio, and still tho truth remain that none south of it can trade tu any place north of it, and none north of it can trade to any port or place south ot it except upon term dicta. ted by a government foreign to , them. These nutlets, east, west and south, are in d.speusabl to the well-being of the p(J pie inhabiting and to inhabit this vast1 Inte rior region. '' :'i Which of the three limy be the best, i no proper' question All are better than cither, and all of right belong to th"people nd to their successor forever. ..True to themselves, they will not. ast wdicre . line of separation shall be, but' wfll vow rather 'hat there shall bp no snch line.'' tfur are tho marginal rer'oti less Interested in these Communicntioim to and through them to the great outside world. Thev, too-ar.d each of them, must havo access lo this Kgypt of the West, without paving toll at the crossing of any national boundary. Our national strife springs not from our perma nent part, not from the laud we inhabit, not from our national homestead. There is no possible severing of this, but would tniilfi ply, and not mitigate, evils among us. In sll its adaptations and aptitudes, it demands union.and abhors separation. Infact.it would ere long force reunion, however much of blood and treasuro the separation might have cost. Our strife pertains to ourselves, to the passing generations of men, and it can not, without convulsion, be hushed forever with the passing of one generation. In this view. 1 recommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amendatory of the Constitution of the United States: ftWiW, By the Sensto ami House of Renrewnt- sUvts of the United Sutes of Auiarirs, in I'onirreu sswrabled, two-ttiints of both Houses coneiirriiir, tlistthe fnltowinr, Artirles b pnp.sed to the Lrg ishtttiresor Conrt-nUims of the koyithI Suites, ss Amend men t tu tho Constitution of the United States, sll orsnrof which Articles, when rutilieil b.T tlm-e-fiiurtlisol Ihvssid lx-irinlstiuvsor Conven tions, to be vsliil ss s psrt or puns of the said Con- siiiiiiinn, rii : Asticli , hverv Stutc wherein slsverr now exists, which shnll HlHilish the same therein' lit snr time ortiiiii-s before the tirst dy of Jnnnurj, in the year oi our l.ora one thousunit nine hin-ilreil, shall receive cnuipetisaUon from Uie United Status, ss follows, to-wit : 1 he I resident of the United Slates shall deliver to every such State Ismds of the I'nited States, ooanng interest st the rato or Tor each slave shown In have been therein br the Eiirhlh Census of the United States, raid bonds to be delivered to such State by installments, or in erne parcel, nt thu completion of Hie abolishment, acc.inlinuly as tho same shall have been ftradnal, or at one time within such state; and interest shnll begin tn run upou any iuoli bond only from tho proper time of its de livery as aforesaid, and afterward. Anv Slate. having received bonds as afurosaid, and afterward introducing or tolerating slavery therein, shali re fund to the United States the bonds so received or tho value thereof and all interest paid thereon. AHTio.t . All staves who shall bare enjoyed actual freedom, by the I'luiuees uf the war, at any time before the end of tho ltcbollinn, shall be forever fiiio) but nil owners of each, who shall not have bieu disloyal, shall be coiiuiensated for them at the same rates as is provided for Shoes adopting alol Isluneiit of slarery, but in such a nay that no slave shall be twice accounted for. Ahtici.k . Coneress nmv aiuinmriate money. and otherwise provide for colnniiing free colored persons, with their own consent, at any ulaoa ur pl.iees without the I'nited Slates. 1 beg indulgence to discuss these pro posed Articles at some length.' itliont blavory the rebellion . could never have existed j without Slavery, it could not continue. Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity of senti ment and of policy in regard to Slavery and the African race among us. Some would abolish it suddenly, uud w thout compen sation ; some would abolish it gradually, and with compensation ;soiue would remove the freed people from us, and some would retain thorn with us; and there aro Jet other minor diversities. Kocauso of these diversities, wo wasio much strength in struggles among ourselves ; by mutual con cession, we should hurmoiii.e and net to gether. This would bo a coinpiomlto among the friends and Hot with the enemies of tho Union. These articles ure intended to embody a plan of such mutual conces sions. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will lollow, at least iu several of the States. As to the first articles, the main points are: 1, The emancipation. 2. The length of time for consummating (thirty-seven years); and, 'I. The compensation. The Fmancipation will bo unsatisfactory totheudvocates ol perpetual Slavery. but tho length of timo should greatly mitiguto their dissatisfaction. The lime spares both races from tho evils of sudden denu geniont, iu lact.trom the necessity ot any derangement; wlnio most of those whose habitual - course of thought will be disturbed by the meas ure will have passed away bolore its coti- sumiiiatiuu. They will never see it. Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation but will deprecate the length ol time. I hey will fool that it gives too little to tho now living slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from tho vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate eman cipation in lochhties where their numbers are very great, aud it gives the inspiriting assurance that their posterity shall be free forever. Ihe pluu leaves to each btuto choosing to act under It to abolish Slavery now or ut tho end nt tlio century, Or at any intermediate time, or by degrees extending over the whole or any part of the period, uud it obliges no two Stutes to proceed alike, li also provides for compensation, anil gen erally the mode of ' making it. This it would seem, must further mitigate tho dis satisfaction of those who favor perpetual Slavery and especially of those who aro to receive compensation. Pouutiess some ot those wdio are to pay and not to recoivo, will ubiect; yet that tho measure is both just and economical is certain. Iho liberation ot the slaves is the ue stractiou of property; property acquired by descent or by purchase, the sumo as any other property. - it is uo less true for having been often said, that the people of the South arc no more responsible for tho original introduc tion of this property than are the people of the North t and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we use all of us use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing iu them, it may not be quite safe to say that the South has been more responsi ble than the North for Us continuance. II, then, for a common object, this property is to bo sacrificed, is it not iust that it bo done at a common charger And if, with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means than we can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it t Let u consider it, then. Let us uscertain the sum we havo expended in tho war since com pensated emancipation wu proposed lust March, and consider whether, if that meas ure had U-eu promptly accepted by even some of the slavo States, tho same sum would not have dono more to close the war than has otherwise been done. If bo, the measure would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and economical measure. Certainly, it is not so easy to pay something as it i to pay nothing. But it is easier to pay a large sum than it Is to pay a larger ono, and it is easier to pay any sum, when wo ar able, than it is to pay it before wo aro able. The wur require them at once. Thy aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation, of course ould tie large, but it would require no nudy cash, nor Uonde, even, any faster thau the oiiiuiieipatjoii progresses. Thi might not, and prububly would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven year. At that time we shall prolrbly have 10l),000.f00 of people to share the., burden, h "iead of [Concluded on the fourth page.]
