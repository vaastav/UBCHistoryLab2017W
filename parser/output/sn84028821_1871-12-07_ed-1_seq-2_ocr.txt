To-day we lay before our read ers the President's Message to Congress. For want of time and space, we cannot make any com ments upon it, farther than to say that it is a very sensible, straight-forward and satisfactory document. We ask for it a close and attentive reading. 

NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. TION. Thc Secretary of the National Republican Executive Committee has issued a call to have a meeting of that committee at Washington, on the 11th day of January, to de cide when and where the next Re publican Presidential Convention shall be held. FIRE IN ENGLAND. A Cable dispatch announces a dis astrous fire at. Warwick Castle, in England, by which an irreparable loss to the antiquary occurred through the destruction of old ar mor, paintings, furniture, &c The great hall is particularly mentioned as having suffered. The baronial hall in Warwick Castle is of great size and antiquity, and retained its old furniture, affording, an accurate picture of mediaeval domestic life. FIRE IN ENGLAND. BAD FOR THE POLICE. Mr. Garner, of Deleware, who was Knocked m the nead witu a hatchet and stabbed, is still livin The police dont seem to be worth much. Not long ago three persons drove into Columbus in a carriage, and on one of the most public thoroughfares, and in the presence of fifty persons, perpetrated a most foul outrage, and tried to do worse, but never since that time have citb cr the police or city authorities been able to tell who those scoundrels were. CUBAN AFFAIRS. Although officials refused to give information is certain that a crisis has arisen in connection, with Cuban affairs which the Cabinet'was espec ially summoned to consider. The King presided at the meeting, pro ducing a profound sensation by pro posing pert onally to proceed to Cu ba to direct pacifactory measures in the Island. It is generally believed the result of the meeting of King and Cabinet was to convoke the Cortes in extra sessjen tc provide means to Crush the insurrection. The excitement is very great, and sympathy is expressed for the gov ernment, even the late ministers proffering their support to the pres ent ministry. 

MORAL COURAGE. There is one navy officer who does not drink and his name is Smith. Admiral Smith gave an en tertainment upon ship board to the Duke Alexis, and not a drop of any thing that could intoxicate was serv ed, though, the refreshments were very elaborate and expensive. That was true moral courage. It requires sometimes, more courage to meet and combat fashion, than to meet a cast-iron foe. Something to drink is so much a matter of course in fashionable circles, and emphatical ly so in military and naval circles, that that officer who has the stamina to fly in the face of the drinking custom, is entitled to as much cred it as one who meets and defies an armed foe, and he should be ranked among the tried heroes. A great hurricane passed over the Island of Cape Bret on on the night of tne 227th ult., destroying ijfc and doing much damage. Three of the Jury in the recent ifisfe gold case were approached with offers -of thousands of dollars each to disagree. The matter will be investigated. The New York World does not indorse John Q. Adams' letter, but is glad to see in it an evidence that the Democracy will attempt to ride no more aaad horses. The Louisiana Democratic State Central Committee are in favor of keeping up the party organization. They decline an alliance with either of the Republican wings of the State. Geo. Elrick, a Carpenter,working at llarK s sach lactory, committed suicide by hanging himself in his room at the American House in Zanesvillc. The Rev. Wm. Sedgwick, aged 82, and for over 50 years a Baptist minister in Muskingum Co., died very suddenly, on last Thursday. He preached in the morning, and at a o cIock was a corpse. Since the passage of the ordin ance prohibiting the sale of ale and beer in New Lisbon, the increase of sicKness has become alarming, the only remedy being the articleknown as 'strictly for medical purposes.' The post master at East Liver pool, Mr. Armstrong, was arrested last Friday ,for malfeasance in office and taken to Cleveland. He was held to bail in the sum of $15,000 to answer at the next term of the U. S. Court. A Paris special states that the government of France is very un easy, and exercises the utmost vigi lance. There is a great display of troops in Pans, and all points arc guarded by patrols every night, while the police are stationed at cv cry street corner. The public mind is very unsettled, and the general impression is that the "present sta tus of affairs can not last and length of time. President Aiers, in his message to the National Assembly on" the re opening or the session, refers to the treaty between France and Germany the commercial convention with England, tho-militaryjaw, and the general reorganization of the ad ministration, but oners no sugges tions as to constitutional changes, and makes no allusion whatever to political subjects. It is a queer woman who asks no questions, but the woman who does is the querist. 

MESSAGE OF THE President of the United States. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4, 1871. The following is the President's message, just transmitted to Con gress: ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS. To the Senate and Home of Representatives: In addressing my third annual message to the law-making branch of the Government, it i3 gratifying to be able to state that during the past year success has generally at tended the effort to execute all laws found upon the statute-books. The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom of the laws already en acted, but to learn their spirit and intent and to enforce them accordingly. 

DISASTERS BY STORM AND FIRE. The past year has, under a wise Providence, been one of general prosperity to the nation. It has, however, been attended with more than usual chastiscments.in the loss of life and property by storm and fire. These disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in our country, and develop a friendship for us on the. part of foreign nations which goes far toward alleviating the distresses occasioned by these calamities. The benevolent who has so generously shared their means with the victims of these misfortunes, will reap their reward in the consciousness of hav ing performed a noble act, and in receiving the greatful thanks of men, women and children whose suffer ings they have relieved. OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS. The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be lriendiy. ihe year has oeen a eventful onc,iu witnessing two great nations, speaking one language and having one lincagc.sctling by peace ful arbitration dispute of long stand ing, and liable at any time to bring those nations into bloody and cost ly connicL An example has thus been set which, if successful in its final issuc,may be followed by other civilized nations, and finally be the means of rcturmn to productive industry millions of men now mantaincd to settle the disputcsjof nations by the bayonet and the Droadsiuc. " TREATY OF WASHINGTON. I transmit -herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been con eluded since the adjournment of Congress with Her Britannic Ma jesty, and a copy of the Protocols of the conferences ot the Commission ers by whom it was negotiated This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending be tween the two nations. Various questions are to bo adjusted by ar bitration. I reccommend Congress at an early day to make the neces sary provision for the tribunal at Uencva,and for several commissions on the part of the United States called for by the treaty. His Ma jesty, the king of Italy, the Presi dent of Swiss Confederation and His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, have each consented, on the joint request ot the two powers, to name an arbitrator for the tribunal at Gen eva. I have caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the readi ness with which the joint request has been complied with by the ap pointmcnt ofgentlenjcn of eminence and learning to these important po sitions. His Majesty, the Emper or of Germany, has been1 pleased to comply with the two governments, and has consented to act as the ar bitrator of the disputed water boun dary between the United States and Great Britain. The contracting parties in the treaty have underta ken to regard as between themselves certain principles of public law for wnicn tne united btatcs have con tended from the commencement of their history. They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of the other mari time powers, and to invite them to accede to them. Negotiations are going on as to the form of the mode by which the invitation is to be ex tended to the powers. I recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries and to the matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North American provinces, to be come operative-as soon as the Dron- er legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britain and its pos sessions, as it is much to be desired that this legislation may become op erative before the fishermen of the United States begin to make their arrangements lor the coming season. I have addressed a communication of which a copy is transmitted here with, to the Governors of New York Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana. Michi gan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, urging upon me viovernments ot those States respectively the necessary ac tion on their part to carry into ef fect the object of the article of the treaty which contem plates the use of the canals on either side connected with the navigation of the lakes and rivers forming the boundary, on terms of equality by me innauiiants oi both countries, It is hoped that the importance of tne object and the benefits to flow therefrom will secure the speedy ap proval and legislative sanction of the States concerned. THE FORTY NINTH PARALLEL. I renew the recommendation for an appropriation to determine the true position of the forty-ninth par allel of latitude, where it forms the boundaiy between United States and the British North American provinces, between the Lake of the Woods and the summit of the Rocky Mountains. The early action of congress on this recomendation would put it in the power of War Department to place a force in the held during the next summer. WITHDRAWAL OF PROTECTION TO GERMANS IN FRANCE. The resumption of diplomatic re lations between France and Ger- man-, have enabled me to give di rections for the withdrawal of the protection extended to Germans in France, by the diplomatic and con sular representatives of the United States in that country. It is just to add that the delicate duty of this protection has been performed by the Minister and the Consul Gener al at Paris and the various Consuls in France, under the supervision of the latter, with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact. 1 heir course has received the com mendation of the German Govern ment, and has wounded no suscepti bility ol the French. GERMANY STILL FRIENDLY. Tim finvm-nment of the Emncror of Germany continues to manucst a friendly feeling towards the Uni ted states, and a desire to narmon- : with the moderate and just policy which this Government main tains in its relations with the Asi atic powers, as well as with South American Republics. I have given assurance that the friendly feelings of that Government are fully shared by the United -States. The ratinicauons oi me consular and naturalization conventions with the Austro-Hungarian Empire have becm exchanged. ITALY. I have been officially informed of the annexation of the States of the Church to the Kingdom of Italy,' and the removal of the capital of that kingdom to .Rome. In con formity with the established policy of the United States, I have recog nized this change. The ratifications of the new treaty of commerce be tween the united bates and Italy have been exchanged. The two powers have agreed in this treaty that private property at sea shall be respected during a war between the two powers. The United States have spared no opportunity of in corporating this rule into the obli gation of nations. CLAIMS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS AGAINST SPAIN. The forty-first Congress, at its third session,made an appropriation for the organization of a mixed com mission for adjudicating upon the claims of . citizens of the United States against Spain, growing out of insurrection in Cuba. That com mission has since been organized. I transmit herewith the correspond ence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this commission will afford the claimants a complete remedy for their injuries, RESTORATION OF PEACE BETWEEN SPAIN AND SOUTH AMERICA. It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to pre side over a conference at Washing ton between the plenipotentiaries of bpain and the allied bouth Amen can Republics, which has resulted in an arm is tic with the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace, RUSSIA—THE GRAND DUKE—CATACAZY. The. intimate friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia contin ue undisturbed., The visit of the third son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his government to ucminish the cordiality of these relations. The hospitable reception which has been given to the Grand JJuke is proof that on .our share the' wishes of that government. The inexcusable course of the Russian Minister, at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall, and to decline to decline to longer receive that func tionary as a diplomatic representa tive. It was impossible with self-respect,! or with a just regard to the dignity of the country, to permit Mr- Uatacazy to continue to hold intercourse with this Government. officials and during his persistent interference through various means with the relations between the Uni- ed States and other powers. In ac cordance with my wishes, this Gov ernment has been relieved of fur thers intercourse with Mr. Cataca zy, and the management of the af fairs ol the Imperial Legation has passed into the hands of a gentle man entirely unobjectionable. OUR INTERCOURSE WITH JAPAN. With Japan we continue to main tain intimate relations. The Cab inet of the Mikado has, since the close of the last session of Congress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of importance in several departments of the Govern ment. I have reason to think that this selection is due to an apprecia tion ot the disinterestedness of the policy which the United States have pursued towards. Japan. It is our desire to. continue to maintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well, as Japan. The cor respondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition on the part of this Government to swerve from its established course. THE WAR WITH COREA. Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our shiwwrecked sailors on the Cor- ean coast, I instructed our Minister at Pekin to endeavor to conclude convention with Corea for securing tne saiety ana humane treatment ol such mariners. Admiral Rogers was instructed to accompany him with sufficient force to protect him in case of need. A small surveying party sent out, on reaching the coast, was treacherously attacked at a disad vantage. Ample opportunity was given for explanation and apology lortnemsuit. JNeituercame. Alorce then landed, and after an arduous march over a rugged and difficult country, the forts from which the outrages were committed were re duccd by a gallant assault, and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and having vindicated the honor ot the uag, the expedition returned, finding it impossible under the circumstances to conclude the desired convention. I respectfully refer to the correspondence relating thereto herewith submitted, and leave the subject for such action as Congress may see fit to take. THE MEXICAN FREE ZONE. The Republic of Mexico has not repealed the very objectionable laws established, relative to what is known as the Free Zone, on the frentier of the United States. It is hoped that this may yet be done. and that more stringent measures may be taken by the Republic for restraining lawless persons on its frontiers. I hope that Mexico, by its own action, will soon relieve this Government of the difficulties ex perienced from these causes. THE SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS. Our relations with the various Republics of Central and South America continues, with one excep tion, to be cordial and friendly. I recommend some action by Congress regarding the overdue installments under the award of the Venezuela Claims Commission of I860. The internal dissensions of this govern ment present no justification for their absence of effort to meet their solemn treaty obligations. The rati fication of an extradition treaty with Nicarauga has been exchanged. 

EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES IN BRAZIL. It is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory step towards the abolition, of slavery. Our relations with that Empire, always cordial, will naturally be made more so by this act. It is not too much to hope that the government of Brazil-may hereafter find it for ,its interest, as well as intrinsically right, to ad vance towards entire emancipation more rapidly than the present at tempt contemplates. The true pros perity and greatness of a nation is to be found in the elevation and ed ucation of its laborers. It is a sub ject for regret that the reforms in .. . i! iY. i !. ;.i i.. inis uireciion wuicii were yuiuuuu- ily promised by the statesmen of bpain have not been carried out in its West India colonies. The laws and regulations for the apparent abolition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave most of the labor ers in bondage with no hope or re lease until their lives become unbur den to their employers. 

AMERICAN CITIZENS OWNING SLAVES ABROAD. I desire to direct your attention to the fact that citizens of the Uni ted States, or person claimiug to be citizens of the United States, are large holders in foreign lands of this species of property, forbidden by fundamental law of their alleged country. I recommend to Congress to provide by stringent legislation a suitable remedy against the hoiam: owning or dealing in slaves or being interested in slave property in for eign lands, either as owners, heirs or mortgages by citizens ortheUm ted States. THE CUBAN INSURRECTION. It is to be regretted that the dis turbed condition of the Island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The ex istence ot a protracted" struggle in such close proximity to our own ter ritory, without apparent prospect of an early termination, cannot be oth er than an object of concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference in the affairs ol other powers, naturally desire to see every country m the undisturbed enjoy ment of peace, prosperity and the blessings of free institutions. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it shonld become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and property of bona fide American cit izens, and to maintain the dignity of the flag. It is hoped that all pending questions with Spain grow ing out of the affairs in Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit- of peace and condition which has hitherto guided the two powers in their treat ment ol such questions. EDUCATION OF AMERICAN YOUTH FOR DIPLOMATIC SERVICE IN CHINA AND JAPAN RECOMMENDED. To give importance and to add .to the efficiency ot our diplomatic re lations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the good opinion of these people, and to se cure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between those nations and the bal ance of the commercial world, 1 earnestly recommend that an appro priation be made to support at least four American youths in each of these countries, to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers there. Oar representatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain and of some other powers. As now situated, our rep resentatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters,who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employees in foreign business houses, or the Interpreters to other foreign Ministers. I would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of supporting the American lines of steamers now plying be tween San Francisco and Japan and China, and the Australian line, al most our only remaining lines of ocean steamers, and ol increasing their services. THE NATIONAL DEBT. Has been reduced to the extent of eighty-six millions, fifty-seven thou sand, one hundred and twenty six dollars and eighty cents during the year, and by the negotiation of na tional bonds at a lower rate of in terest, the interest on the public debt has becu so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for interest account is nearly seventeen millions ot' dollars less than on the first of March, 1800. It was,highly desirable tli.it the rapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dollar of lia bilities without bankrupting them. DIMINUTION THE BURDENS OF TAXATION. a a But in view of the accomplish ment, of these desirable ends, of the rapid development of the re sources of the country, its increas ing ability to meet large demands and the amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present, re sources of the country should con tinue this rapid payment, i recom mend that all taxes from internal sourccsbe abolished, except those collected from spiritous, vinous and malt liquors, tobacco in its various forms, and for stamps. There are many articles not produced at home but which enter largely into general consumption,through articles which arc manufactured at home, such as medicines, compounded, &c, from which very little revenue is derived, but which enter into general use, All such articles I recommend to be placed on the free list. I have not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat what will be laid before you in the report of the becretary ol the Treasury. SALARIES COLLECTORS OF CUSTOMS. The present laws for collecting the revenues pay collectors of cus toms small salaries, but provide for moieties or shares in all seizures, which, at the principal, ports of en try particularly, raise the compensa tion of these officers to a large sum It holds out an inducement to dis honest men, should such get posses sion of these offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered, to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your attention is respect- luiiy invited to this subject. 

ARMY. For the operations of the armv in the past year, the expense of main taining it, the estimates for the on- suing year, and for continuing sea coast and other improvements con ducted under the supervision of the War Department, I refer you to the accompanying report of the becre taryofWar. I recommend that the officers in each grade in the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number in any one grado falls below the number so fixed, that the vacancy may be filled by promotion from the grade below. I also recom mend that when the office of chief of a corps becomes vacant, the place may be filled by a selection from the corps in which the vacancy exists. THE NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the number and efficiency of the naval force, without material increase m the expense of supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted, and is being extended as fast as material will admit, of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By this means wo have been enabled to occupy at onco a larger extent of cruising grounds, to visit more frequently the posts where the presence of our flag is de sirable, and generally to discharge more eificiently'thc appropriate du" ties of the navy in time ot peace, without exceeding the numbers of men or theexpenditurcsauthorized by law. During the past year the navy has, in addition to its regular service, supplied the men and officers for the coast; survey, and has com pleted the surveys authorized by Congress of the Isthmus of Daricn and Tehuantepec, and Under like authority has sent out an expedi tion completely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of the North. The .sugges tions of the report as to the neces sity for increasing .and improving the material of the navy, and the plan recommended for reducing the the pereonal of the service to a peace standard by the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduc tion of others, and the employment of some in the service of the com mercial marine, are well considered, and deserve the thoughtful atten tion of Congress. I also recom mend that all promotions in the navy above the rank of Captain be by selection instead of by seniority. This course will secure in the higher grades greater efficiency, and hold out an incentive to-young officers to improve themselves in the knowl edge of their profession.- -The pres ent cost of maintaining the navy, its cost compared with that of the pre ceding year, and the estimates for the ensuing year are contained in accompanying report of the Secre tary of the Navy. THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT. The enlarged receipts of the Post- office Department, as shown by the accompanying report of the Post master General, exhibits a gratify ing increase in that branch of the public service. It is the index of the growth of education and of the prosperity of the people, two ele ments highly conductive to the vig or and stability of republics. With a vast territory like-'ours, much of lb Bpuisui pupuiauiu, uuu.au requir ing the services of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that this Department can be made self-sus taining; but a gradual approach to this; end from year to year is con fidently- relied on, and the day is not far distant when the Postofflce De partment of the Government will prove a much greater blessing to the whole people than it is now. The suggestions of the .Postmaster General for. improvements in the Department presided over by him are earnestly recommended to your' special attention. Especially do I recommend the favorable considera tion of the plan for uniting, the tel egraphic system of the. United States with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced, and the service as well if not better rendered. It would se cure the further advantage of ex tending the telegraph through por tions of the country where private enterprise will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and, above all, the effojts to bring a people widely separated into a community of in to a community of interests, are al ways benefitted by a rapid inter communication; education, the grand work of republican institu tions, encouraged, by increasing the facilities to get the news speedily from all parts, of the country. The desire to reap the benefits of such improvements will stimulate educa tion. I refer you to the report of Postmaster tieneral for full details of the operations of last year, and lor comparative statements of re sults with former years. THE
