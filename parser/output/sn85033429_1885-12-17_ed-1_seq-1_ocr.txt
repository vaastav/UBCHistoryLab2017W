" BRIEF COMMENT. President Cleveland's Message after reference to the death of Vice President Hendricks and the Constitutional rela tions between the Executive and the Leg islative Departments of Government, an- . nounccs that the United States continued ' to be on friendly terms with., all foreign Power. Austria having objected to Mr. Kelley for reasons the President could not recognize, the Mission to that tsoun ' . try remains vacant. The Nicaragua Ca .' . nal Treaty is withheld from resubmission to the Senate, but some other plan for. . Isthmian transit, free from entangling al ltances, is urged, and the Tehuantepec , route is named for consideration. ; The Chinese question in the western ' States, despite the restrictive legislation, is far from satisfactory. But all the pow " er of the1 government should be exerted to maintain the amplest good faith tow ;, ard China in the treatment of emigrants from, that country. ' '. On the fishery question, the President recommends that Congress provide for a ; Commission in which the governments of the United States and Great Britain shall ' be represented, charged with the settle ment of the entire questions of the fishing rights of the two countries. He urges legislation to make the recently conclud ed commercial treaty with Mexico effec tive. Of international copyright, he says ' action is desirable to bring about the ob ject in view. The inadequacy of legislation touching citizenships and naturalization is brought to the attention of Congress. It is im . portant that the right of aliens to domlcle as distinguished troin federal naturauza ' tlon, be defined. THE 

TARIFF, i Increased appropriations for the diplo matic and consular service are earnestly urged. ,.r' Reviewing the report of the Secretary j.i 'of the Treasury, tho President calls for a ' reduction of revenue by i lowering the tariff on the necessaries of life; the sub- ject to be dealt with in a spirit friendly to American industry. Abolition of the tariff . on works of art is advised. 

SILVER QUESTION. A long and detailed argument form ing a leading feature of the Message follows in favor of suspending the com pulsory coinage of silver. WAR AND NAVAL SERVICE.' ' - Reviewing the report of the Secretary of War, the President recommends a re form iacourt martial proceedings, aiem- ... edy- for the present defenceless condition of our seacoasts, and a law prohibiting - the construction of bridges over navlpw- ble waters in such manner as to obstruct navigation. , . - . ; . Referring to our navy, the Secretary's "business principles" in the Dolphin case and that of the cruisers are approved, and he expresses the hope that the day is not far distant when we will have a navy such as befits our standing among tho na tions'; but before we proceed further in i restoration of the navy we need athor . oughjy reorganired navy department. 

PORTAL AFFAIRS. Of postal affairs, he says: That the an ticipated! and natural revival of postal . revenues has; been oppressed and retard ed by unfavorable condition cf the coun try, of which the postal service is a faith ful indication. ,Tho action of the Postmaster-General concerning transportation of foreign mails, and his recommendation of a reduction, of postal order fees, are approved..'- Of ocean subsidies, he thinks that if such gifts of public money are to be made for the purpose of aiding any enterprise in the supposed interests of the public the amount to he paid and the bencflcia- ry should bodetermlned by Congress. ; RELIEF JKTO THE COURTS. ' The President endorses the plan sug gested by the Attorney General in his re port, for a remedial legislation to relieve the over-burdened courts of the United States, and favors paying United States marshals and district attorneys salaries Instead of compensation by fees. THE INDIAN QUESTION. . , He recommends the passage of a law authorizing the appointment of six com missioners, three of whom shall be de tailed from the army, to be charged with ' the duty of a careful Inspection of all In- dians upon our reservations, with the ' view of discovering their exact condition . and needs and determining what steps shall be taken on behalf of the govern ment to improve their situation in the dl , rection of their self -support and complete civilization. . a... 

PROTEST AGAINST MOBMONIBM. - He commends to the attention of Con- ress, the recommendations of Secretary amar, with reference to the repeal and modification of certain laws, of polyga mv. He savs that there is no feature of it or system which sanctions It, which is not opposed to alt that is of value in our institutions. There should be no relaxa tion in the execution of tho law now In nneratlon. and lie will gladly approve, of further discreet legislation which will rid the country of this blot upon its fair fame. THE CIVIL SERVICE. Of civil service reform, the President is inclined to think that there Is no sen timent more general in the minds of the people of our countrv. than a conviction of the correctness of the principle upon which the law enforcing civil service ro form Is based, and he ventures the hope that wo shall never again be remitted to a system which distributes public positions purely as rewards for partisan service. The allurements of the immense num ber of o Ml ccs itnd places exhibited to the voters of the land and the promise of tlielr bestowal in recogultion of partisan activity, debauch suffrage and rob politl . cal action of Its thoughtful and delibera tive character. Evil would increase with a multiplication of offices consentient upon tho extension and growth of the country. Civil service reform, he says, came none too soon to check the prog ress ofpolltlcal demoralization. An In crease ft the salaries of the Civil Service Commissioners is advised. One of the minor hut yet important recommendations of the President is prompt action by Congress to secure proper accommodation and protection for the capltol library. THE 

SUCCESSION. His last recommendation, placed imme diately precoding the closing paragraph THE DEAD CROESUS. MR. VANDERBILT'S CAREER. From Leading fapers of the United States. New York World : An able State docu ment, 'i .- ' - ' Atlanta Constitution; ' In all, the mes sage is a notable one. Cincinnati Enquirer: There is nothing remarkable about tho President's mes sage but its length. . . .' Augusta Chronicle: It is happily reliev ed of the insipid and colorless allusions to general matters, which have too long been the rule. , ,.' . ,. Chicago Inter-Ocean: Ho is more of a Morrison man than a Randall man. That is about all that can be said of his cau tious utterances on this subject. Memphis Avalanche: His emphatic declaration that the interests which have been encouraged by protection shall not aave M muiessiy witnurawn is sumcieiu ly definite as to his views. tt . New York Timet: It is something more and higher than a business message. Its comments and suggestions are many, its principles are the highest. Nashville American: There is one suggestion which the Democrats are not yet prepared to receive, which is that tho coinage of the silver dollar should cense. Courier-Journal: He has a grasp of the details that is astonishing, and . his statements concerning every question in dispute are so clear, forcible and equivo cal as to inspire confidence among his followers and uneasiness among his op ponents. New York Sun: If his conclusions are, almost without exception, identical with the conclusions of the members of his cabinet, that shows the remarkable harmony of opinion existing in the pres ent administration, rather than any lack of independent ideas on the part of Mr. Cleveland. ; . Commercial Oazette:' One would have to be moved by a spirit of fault-finding to say much against it as a summary of current history, with the exception of the remark that it Is too long tor tue con venience or instruction of the public. Philadelphia Press: It lacks the sen tentious directness of Grant, the epi grammatic force of Lincoln and the scholarly finish of Garfield; but all in all it 1b a virile, sensible, worthy public pa- per. On one or two points we should take broad issue with the President; but in the main his message deserves cordial approval. New York Tribune: On some of the most important auestions of which it treats it deserves hearty praise. The President's message is most right jiist where his party is most wrong, and his best advice is lust that which is least likely to bo followed.

BRAKES PUT DOWN. . Mo More Appointment During December Office Seeker Mnt Wait Awhile. "Washington, - December - 11, Tho President having now finished his mcs sage, has determined to rest a while and wait until the Senate has taken some ac tion on his appointments made during the vacation. He has sent word to the Postmaster General that no more post masters shall be suspended without just cause, and no new ones shall be appoint ed, durlnir this month. : He is also deter mined to wait a while with other appoint ments. He has refused numerous re quests from Senators and Representatives in this regard, and no less a person than Hon. Samuel J. Kandall lias Decn tola that he could not comply with his re quests. Mr. Randall wanted a change in Pennsylvania, but the President said, "I have- determined not to make any more appointments during December; The President's Queer Visitor. The President had quite a crowd at his reception to-day. It is noticeable- what a number of ladies residing hero come up to the White House once or twice a week to attend these receptions. One who at tends them regularly can sec the same la dies generally twice a week sometimes three times. They take their places be hind the President, in one corner made by the pillars in tho center of the room, and watch him shake hands and com ment on tho ladies who nervously shake tho President's hand. Then, towards the last of tho reception, they take their places in line, and pass by with a pleas ant smllo and bow. Several were there to-day. Among the men was one stray office seeker, who stopped directly In front of the President and said: "Mr. President, can't I see you for a few minutes after the reception?" 'Sorry, but I am afraid 11 is impossi ble," replied Cleveland. "Can't I see you this afternoon for a minute?!' ; r ;r The President shook his head. : "Then, can't I see you to-morrow morning for a second or two?" he per sisted. "Well, maybo to-morrow morning I can see you, but, remember, only for a second or two," replied the President ' 'Yes, sir, only a second ; that will be plenty," and the man left delighted. The reception had hardly closed before a Chinaman entered the White House and began to look around. After he had seen the East Room ho started to go up stairs, but was stopped by Sergeant Dins moro. "Mo wantce see clulfosity," tho Chinaman explained. "But there are no curiosities up there," replied Sergeant Dinsmorej "that is pri vate." "Me comeo far way to see cluliosity; me wantce sec the cluliosity muchce," still persisted the Chinaman, who was dressed in ademi American-Chinee style. It was some time before Sergeant Dins more could explain, and at last the China man left quite disgusted because he could not see and shake hands with the Ameri can "cluliosity." Experts, who with pick and spade have scratched tho rough crust of the earth in tho line of the Blue Ridge, in the county of Rockbridge, Va., report tho discovery of most valuablo veins of tin ore. This tin ore is large, and many tracts of land bavo lately been bonded to miners, but tho best veins appear to be along the waters of Irish Creek, in tho Northeastern corner of tho county. Tho veins are generally less than a foot thick, but somo are three or four feet thick, and the tin stone occurs in crystals, in nodules and in strings. Born at New Brunswick, N. J., in 1821, William H. Vanderbllt began his busi ness career at the age of eighteen in a Wall street banking house. He left there two years later, owing to ill health, and engaged in the cultivation of an unim proved farm on Statcn Island. During some years following he tolled as hard as any farmer ever did. He went to the fields before sunrise and was still there at sunset. In-a few years he had so extend ed his labors that he had three hundred and fifty acres in the best managed and most profitable farm on Stnten Island, and yielded to the owner a large annual income. While lie was working so hard here he had a heavy indebtedness for the propsrty hanging over him, which he was seeking to pay. After he became in terested in railroads be gave no further personal labor on his farm, but he did uot ccaso to manage it. His first experience as a lailroad man was as receiver or the statcn island Railroad Company. This is only a short road, but the company was overwhelmed with debt and embarrassments. He paid off the debts, connected tho road with New York by an independent ferry and placed it upon a securo financial basis. Then he became president of the road. He resigned - to go abroad to furnish necessary attention to his brother George, who was sick and finally died in Europe. in 1804. alter his return, William 11. Vanderbilt was elected vice president of New York and Harlem Railroad Com pany and the following year of the Hud son River Railroad Company. He now entered fully upon his career as a rail road man. uunng tue entire subse quent life of Commodore Vanderbilt his son William was his confidant and chif reliance and agent in everything. He familiarized himself with every detail and personally supervised every depart ment, stopped the leaks, reduced the expenditures and increased tho business of the roads to an unparalleled extent. The Harlem Railroad, which was bank rupt when tho Vandcrbilts became Us owners, was made one of the best-equip ped and best-paying roads in the State. The Hudson River Railroad was trebled in value, and In 18G0 the Central and Hudson River were consolidated, making a corporation with ninety millions of capital. William II. Vanderbilt was named in the articles of incorporation as vice president and executive otllccr. Upon the death of Commodoro Van derbilt William inherited the chief part of his estate, amounting to something in the neighborhood of ono hundred mill ions. It ' was principally in railroad bonds and stocks. ' Tho will was unsuc cessfully cntecd hy sottie mombers of 'the family. William II. Vanderbilt was soon elected to his father's positions in the different railroad companies, and from that time has held the controlling interest. In order to divide his great re sponsibility he not lon since sold stock to the extent of fifty millions to leading capitalists of this country and Europe. He Invested the same money in United Stotcs bonds and was the largest Indi vidual holder of those securities. While he was a Wall street clerk Mr. Vanderbilt married Miss Kissam, an at tractive and educated woman, who still lives. Mr. Vanderbilt, like his father, was fond of good horses and spent a great deal of money to gratify his tastes, Mr. Vanderbllt's railroad stocks was at the time mentioned 198,750,000, of his governments $70,580,000, of his railroad bonds 120,857,420,-of his other securities a trifle over $5,000,000. The aggregate was $201,832,418. There is a good deal to be added to this enormous sum. Mr. Vanderbilt's real estate, for instance, is believed to be worth $3,000,000, hiB art gallery and furniture $1,000,000, his sta bles and horses $300,000. His income during these days was not far from $12,000,000 a year. From his governments he drew $2,372,000 a year, from his railroad stocks and bonds, $7, 894,820; from his miscellaneous securities $575,695, or $10,842,015 from his invest ments alocc. Thus every day thev earn ed for him $28,334 25. Every hour saw him $1180 59 richer and every minute meant $19 67 added to his hord. Besides this, he calculated to make $2,000,000 every year by fortunate sales. His rein vestments in the year 1883 were calculat ed at $2,000,000. - 

NOTES AND OPINIONS. ON SUBJECS OF GENERAL TEREST. IN- ,' FOR FEMININE READERS. Queer Wedding: Cutom In Norway. In Norway the marriage festivities ex tend over several days. Early in the af ternoon of tho day which precedes .the wedding the guests appear, and are wel comed In the court yard by bride and bridegroom, With an offering of beer and spirits. When all arc assembled they are invited by the schoolmaster, who acts as master of ceremonies, to partake of tho meal prepared. They sit down at a shin ing table, over which no cloth is spread, and, after grace has been said and a psalm sung to the accompaniment of two violins, do justice to the simple repast. Flat cakes serve as platters, and everybody cuts the viands with his or her own knife, using tho fingers of the left hand as a fork. The greater part of the night is spent in Fniriilini, mill ilnnntmr 11,, wing win. V.l..l. Tho next morninir at 8 the brido and bridegroom appear ful ly dressed in tneir wedding tinery anil ready to proceed to church. The most conspicuous ornaments of tho bride are the wedding crown and a number of necklaces both made of silver or silver gilt, and sometimes of exquisite ancient workmauship. In somo parts of Norway, especially In the provitico of Hnrdangcr, the bride wears a purple robe, richly braided and embroidered with gold. The wedding party then proceods to church, either by water in boats or by land on horseback. The first boat contains bride and bride groom, two bridemaids, the two best men and the fiddlers; the second boat is rowed by six boys and the third by six girls. If the journey is mado on horseback tho musicians open the procession; then fol low the bridegroom surrounded by his friends and male relations; the bride es corted by her bridemaids, and ultimately the rest of the invited gueuts. The caval cade never stops on its way to church, but the roturn tourney takes a Ions time From every homestead on tho way shots arc fired to announce the approach of the' nowly wcd.fr-d piiic-w who have then to dismount, acknowledge the greeting and partake of tho customary offering of beer or liquor. At last the home is reached, and the company immediately sits down to tho wedding dinner, at which bride and bridegroom preside. . When the meal is over the "cradle tax" is collectd. Tho bridegroom's father commences by plac ing in a tin dish, which stands in front of the bride, a bank note and two silver spoons, friends, relations and guests fol lowing his cxamplo with lesser gifts. In this way more than one hundred llialers are sometimes collected. ' Tho rest of the Coming State. It is announced that the population of Washington Territory is now 129,438, ah increase of 36,930 in two years. The offi cial report to Secretary Lamar also states that tho assessed value o2 property for taxation is over $.)0,000,000. In 1880, tho assessed value in Washington Territory was less than $24,000,000, and its valua tion is now about what that oi Oregon was then, and nearly as largo as that of Florida and Nevada put together. The reported population, if correctly stated at 129,000, is nearly large enough already to entitle the community to a representative in Congress. Before two years more have elapsed, before an enabling act could be passed and the organization of a Stale perfected, Washington Territory would undoubtedly have more than the popula tion required to entitle it to a seat in Con gress. But what of that? Nobody doubts that uaKota lias at least twice tue population to entitle it to a seat in Consrcss. The valuation of property in Dakota was less nvo years ago tuan in Washington Terri tory, and it has undoubtedly increased far more rapidly. It is permanent prop erty; its value docs not depend upon tho possible failure ot gold and silver mines. but upon tho productiveness of broad acres. Yet Democrnts at the National Uapitol decline to consider the question wiieuier uaKoia is entitled to reprcscnta tion in Congress, and to organization as a Stato or States, bceauso that Territory uappens to be uepublicnn In Us political opinions. The latest form of appeal made to the leading Uemoerats of V ash- ington is anything but complimentary to them. They are told that, if they pass such acts as may enable the people of Dakota to enjoy more convenient covorn ment, and to indulge in the hope of ulti mate admission to tno Lnlon, with sepa rate State organizations for tho two wide ly separated portions of tho inhabited ter ritory, public gratitude in Dakota is like ly to increase the strength of the Demo cratic party there. That is true, but if the community is entitled to representa tion it is a disgrace that tho Democratic parly refuses the rights which belong to

Tho irirl A It i! form in llurlal Ceremony. Ono of tho coining reforms of tho day is in the matter of pall bearers at fash ionablo funerals. The casket used weigh: 350 pounds, and with the body of an adult tho weight reaches not less than 500 pounds, oftcner 550. Eight gcntlcmc arc selected by tho friends of tho deceas ed, men usually of matured or advanced age, rarely young men, and still moro rarely, men whose muscles arc accus tomed to bear heavy struin. Even, should the 500 pounds be evenly distributed the process oi carrying would be attended with unusual effort, but it is not. There is the descent at the residence, not unfrc quently from the second floor to the side walk, then comes tho inevitable ascent at tho church, coupled in both instances with raising or lowering the casket from the carriage, a process which is again re peated at the grave. Then only aro the pall-bearers released; and the strain nlno times in tcu has fallen so heavily upon the bearers on one side of the casket or at one end, that the effects linger for weeks; sometimes for months. The honor would be as deeply felt and tho solemnity en hanced if the undertaker were called upon for four or half a dozen meu accus tomed to lifting, tho pall bearers acting In their honorary capacity following tho casket at the several transfers between the house and the grave.

A Son and a Dnuehter Who Have Lived Under a Fnlne Name for Twenty Year. Boston, December 6. A rumor, cred ited to tho author of a book recently printed at Birmingham, Ala., was widely circulated not long ago to the effect that John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Pres dent Lincoln, was still alive. A gentle man of this city, who Is well acquainted with the widow of Booth, wrote to her, enclosing the newspaper paragraph. His letter brought thcfollowing touching re- ply: "An item in the Boston Herald has just como to my notice of some man, un known, in Birmingham. Ala., who has a desire to resurrect John Wilkes Booth. W hoover this man may be. let me warn the public that his only motivo must ho to make money, for, as sure as tho sun snines in the heavens, so sure is John Wilkes Booth dead. I, myself, saw him buried, saw ond examined his body be fore It was laid In its final resting place. He carried marks upon his body known only to his family and intimate friends, and these marks were identified by his family. AVe all know that the last act of his life wns wrong. We also know that wo Bhould not judge. We know not the why or wherefore, but it is my opinion that those of us who live long enough will yet learn that, ulthough it was John Wilkes Month s hand that struck the fa tal blow that ended a good man's life, yet it was those in high authority who were the bond of a diabolical conspiracy, the result of which steeped several families in the deepest of woe and left a nation to mourn." AlthoiiL'h not cencrully known, J. W. Booth left a family a wife and two chil dren, a daughter and son, now crown to womanhood and manhood. This family has lived in seclusion, and under a false name for twenty years. For these inno cent ones' sakes let their dead alone, and let them sorrow in peace. I beg for the sake of tho Booth family, now mourning over the death of the mother of J. Wilkes Booth, that the public will show somo little charity, nnd leave tho wrongs that somo ono lias done in the hands of a higher power, who, in His own good time, will make nil things right. Let the dead rest for the sake of the living and tno innocent, A GREAT INVENTION. A CHATTANOOGAN INVENTS A ROTARY "MOVEMENT." A New Departure Simplicity Itnelf-Sold to a New York Company Conalder atlnn $50,000. James Cook, well known to . many . Chattanoogans as a quiet, steady, Indus trious man, a jeweler iu a small way aud very handy with watchmakers' tools, hs elaborated an Invention which will bring him fuluro fame and wealth. It is an ab- solutcly new departure in watches, a movement In which the lever in any shape is dispensed with and In which the balance wheel keeps steadily revolving never reversing, as all others fio and have done since the days of-the first horolglst. Unimportant as this, may seem, at the first glance, there is.-or may be, very much in it, at least so think New York jewelers and monied men to whom be showed it in a recent visit East. A joint stock company with a capital of $300,000, has been formed, headed by Mudgctt & Co. The company pay Mr. Cook for his invention $50,000, four fifths in stock, tho remaining $10,000 in cash, and under the name of the New York Watch Company, will erect an immense factory-, of the practical part of which he will be super intendent. Those who know the unlimited sale of : cheap watches can rcalizo tho value ff Mr. Cook's. invention when told that the movements can be mado at a cost of fifty conls each. The lever watch must go through ' the hands of seventeen skilled workmen. The rotary dispenses with nearly all of that class, and is mado at a merely nominal expense. A patent is pending, but Mr. Cook, not quite satisfied, is working the veiu in which lie has already struck n bonanza. no is working at a movment wnicudis pensccs with the balance lever, which. hen perfected, the n aterbury Watch Company will purchase. The same prin ciple will bo applied to clocks and the Ansonia Company, of Connecticut, one of the largest in the world, wishes to adopt It. Mr. Cook keeps on the even tenor of his way. If his claims are substantiated he will be fnirlv entitled to tho title of Chattanooga's Edison of time.

Vanderbilt' Wealth. His exact wealth at any particular time will never be known, but it has been esti mated by competent parties as follows, somo years ago: "Registered in his name, and in coupon bonds, $54,000,000 in 4 per cents, matur ing in 1007. Ho had added to these $4, 000,000 In 0 per cents, and yet retained a trifle over $1 ,000,000 In 6 per cents. Tho 4 per cents wcro worth 124, and tho market value of his governments was $70,580,000. But tho bulk of the wealth of the king . of millionaires was invested in railroad securities. . Ho held 240,000 shares of Michigan Central stock, 800,000 shares of Northwestern, including 80,000 of tho preferred stock, and a block of Umaha, KUO.OOU shares of Lako tihore and 120,000 shares, of New York Central. Be sides this were smaller amounts In ascoro of other stocks, among which were Rock Island, of which he had 29,000 shares and Lackawanna, where the total was 20,000. Of the others ho had in all 21,840, a grand total of 930,840 shares of stock." . , . Of various railroad bonds there was an aggrcgalo of $22,120,000, and of Stato and city bonds $3,200,000. In miscellane ous securities, manufacturing stocks and - mortgages the sum of about $2,000,000 was shown to ue invested, the then to decorating the tablo with flowers and fruit. Great is tho ambition of tho pupil to hear that her taste and management aru the best. Combined with these duties aro those of keeping tho household linen in repair and learning plain sewing. Thus the young girl gets experience in household affairs. Kolilniion Crunoe' Inland. Tho Island of Juan Fernandez Is ac curately described, and the visitor who is familiar with Robinson Crusoe can find the cave, the mountain paths and other haunts of the hero without difficul ty. It is covered with beautiful hills and lovely valleys, the highest peak renchlng an elevation of nearly 3,000 feet. After independence in 1821 Chili mado Juan Frenandei a peual colony, but thirty years after tho prisoners mutinied, slaughtered the guards and escaped Then It was leased to a cattlo company which li as now iiu.ouo Head oi homed cattlo and as many sheep grazing upon the bills. 1 ucre arc fifty or sixty mliab itants, mostly ranchmen and their fami lies, who tend tho herds and raise vegc tables for tho Valparaiso market.

Hurled from lied at Four O'clock The Building Destroyed. ..- Pirrsntmo, Dec. 11. One of tho most peculiar explosions that has ever occur red in tliis region of natural gas took place this morning at Cannonsburg, in Washington county. A largo frame houso was blown to pieces and tho occupants, Wesley Greer, n rich stock dealer, and his wife and two children, were hurled from their beds Into a two acre lot sur rounding the house, landing thirty feet away. Tho .explosion took place at 4 a. m. Tho roof was lifted from tho houso with such' terrific force as to bo carried some distanco away. Tho sides of tli e building, bulged out by tho explosion, fell.

Tho members of the family are not fa tally Injured, Mr. Greer's hair and mus tache arc signed and his neck injured. Mrs. Greer Is burned about tho bend and hands and her hair partly burned of. A baby escaped without injury. It was se curely wrapped up In bed and tho cloth ing it is supposed saved Its life. A ten year old boy was less fortunate and is pretty badly burned auout tue uouy. l no report of tho explosion, which could be beard for a mile awoy, aroused tno peo ple of Cannonsburg and the light from tho burning building brought relief to Mr. Greer and his family. Tho building occupied an elevated position In the cen tre of a two-acro plot of ground. Natural gas was not used in the house, but a local gas pipe line skirts tho lower portion of Mr. Greer's ground, somo forty or fifty yards from the house. The theory ad vanced is that there was a iraK in the gas line and that tho gas found Its way to tho building through somo old drain leading from the house. In this way the danger ous fluid had accumulated in the cellar. From thcro it tilled every apartment in the building before, the explosion took place. An Klcphant Crushes a Lion.
