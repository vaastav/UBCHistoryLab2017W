HOUSEWIFE. The statement recently made by Mrs. Harriet Stanton Blatch, a New Tork club woman, that "divorce and marital infelicity are caused in almost ©very instance, by the ignorance of American women," may not be true, but Mrs. Blatch gives a little advice that might well be followed. If wom en only would use common sense and take a day off from their household drudgery once a week, she Insists, a great part of the domestic troubles would be obviated. The average woman, she says, be comes a household drudge as soon as she Is married, her disposition is sour ed and she becomes such a self-made pessimist as to make her incapable of bringing up a family of healthy-mlnd ''ildren. Here's the way Mrs. f: i. it .puts it: »A woman who stays ail the time in ner home helps the community to stagnate. Her mentality is undevelop ed and crude, and she is not one to whom her husband or son can go for advice. She may know how to boil potatoes and ham to perfection, but shp does not know enough to advise her children whether to become plumbers or bootblacks or aeronauts. Her judgment is valueless. And yet, the woman who is a good ham boiler thinks she knows everything. Mrs. Blotch may be overdrawing it Slightly, but in the main she is right. Seven days before the range and be hind the broom with the husband and the family coming home to meals and then leaving, is not a condition to leave mother in a very sweet state of mind. It may not wholly sour her disposition and make her the scold ing wife the New York club woman pictures, but neither will it fill her with that enthusiastic joy of living the spring poets write of. The compositor in setting up Mrs. Blatch's name mav have made an er ror.' Her name may be "Miss Batch," another of those maiden ladies who delight in giving advice to their mar ried sisters, but anyway the advice is sound. Take a day off occasionally, Mjfs, Housewife. Go down town and task at the new hats and the new ctoakb whether you can afford them or not. If tfirere is a matinee, take it in. If not, stop on your way home and call on a few of your old friends. You may keep them from their work for a few minutes, but if they are of the class of drudges from whose ranks you are breaking away, it will do theni good to be kept in idleness for a while. And if the work has accumulated while you were away, let your hus band and the children help you with it Jn the president's message figures are. quoted to show that the net in eoin" of the government over the ex penditures has averaged about $31 000,000 a year during the last six years, a showing made possible, the president says, by the satisfactory working of the present tariff law. Relative to this the message says: The income account of the nation is in a most satisfactory condition. For the six fi?cal years ending with the 1st of July last,, the total expenditures and revenues of the national government, exclusive of the postal revenues and expenditures, were. In round numbers, revenues, $5,465,000,000, and expendi tures, $3,275,000,000. The next excess of income over expenditures including in the latter the fifty millions expend ed for the Panama canal, was one hun dred and ninety million dollars for the six years, an average of about thirty one million a year. This represents an approximation between Income and outgo which It would be hard to im prove. The satisfactory working of the present tariff law has been chiefly responsible for this excellent showing. Nevertheless, there is an evident and constantly growing feeling among our ppoplQ that the time is rapildy ap proaching when our system of revenue legislation must be revised. Most men in business operating un der a system that gave them such sub stantial returns would be inclined to continue operating under that system so long as the balance remained on the right side. "We cannot afford to lose that pre eminently typical American, the farm er, -jrno owns his own medium sized farm," declares President Roosevelt in his message. The Presi dent takes the position that it would be nothing short of a calamity if the place of the small farmer were. tak?n by a class of great landlords with tenant-farmed estates. On this sub ject the president says: "No growth of cities, no growth of wealth, can make up for any loss in either the number of the characters of the farming population. We of the United States, should realize this above almost all other peoples. We began our existence as a nation of farmers, and in every great crisis of the past a peculiar dependence has had to be placed upon the farming popula tion and this dependence has hither to been justified. But it can not be justified in the future if agriculture •s permitttd to sink in the SCA'. ns compared with other employments. The growth of our cities is a good ilung but on'.v in so far as it dot's not Mean a growth at the expense of the country fancier. We Titist ihe rise of physical sciences in their ppr-lieatlon to sgricritarru practices, and we must do all we can to render country conlitr.ns m-'re easy .ind r) asant." THE 

AMES SCHOOL. The success of the team from Iowa State college in the stock judging con tests held in connection with the live stock exposition at Chicago cannot but be gratifying: to lowans. This year the team from the Ames school won the highest gen eral averages for all judging for the third successive time, and won, as in the preceding years, from the picked men of the best agricultural colleges in the country. Not only this, but five of the eight, professors who coached the teams takiug part in the contests are graduates of the Iowa school. The standing of the teams shows Iowa's easy victory: College. Grade. 1—Iowa State college 4767 2—Ontario Agricultural college.. 4622 3—Missouri Agricultural college. 4605 4—Ohio State university 4550 5—Kansas Agricultural college.. 4450 fi—Texas Agricultural college... 4337 7—Washington college 4332 S—South Dakota college 4091 Iowa is proud of the Ames school It has brought credit to the state in its competitive trials against similar educational institutions, and its sons have done much to raise the standard of farming in the state and to place Iowa Is proud of the Ames school, tural states.

She should move her feet lightly, dainty and easily with a slightly springy action, but the spring must not be overdone. She must walk straight. Her knees should be straight and her toes turned out slightly. There must be no artificial bend or limp no affectation of lassitude on the one hand or of horslness on the other. She must not bustle through with her shoulders constantly in evi dence and her arms swinging, and she must hold up her chin. Now here is advice from one who is not an authority. Just forget all of these directions and walk naturally. If you were designed in nature's mold to walk with your knees other than straight and without the slightly springy action the authority speaks of you will walk more gracefully if you do not try to spring A Chicago judge freed a mat charged with breaking into a girl's room and attacking her, on the ground that the prisoner was intoxicated .it the time and not capable of forming the Intent necessary to make up the crime charged because he was not in the possession of his faculties. The judge would have a hard time to ex plain upon what he based a ruling giving intoxication as an excuse for crime. A probation officer in the Cleveland juvenile court holds a fathers' con gress to be more necessary than a mothers' congress. "The trouble is." he says, "that the fathers know noth ing about their homes and their chil dren. They seem to think if they pro vide the money that is all that is necessary. The fathers of the country should regain closer relationship with their boys and their homes." It sounds like good advice, too. BONAPARTE.

Hotly more will be cured if they do not delay too long. Nearly all the people who suffer from Chronic Diseases neglect treatment until they are compelled to do something then they expect to be cured in a very short time. Why delay until your disease Is so Chronic. I have restored many to health, many who say to me: "Doctor, I am glad you advertised, for If you had not used the medium of the newspaper I would not have known you had the ability to cure my disease." I do an office business, medical and surgical practice. I have been located in Ottumwa for fifteen years.

Throat and Lungs, Stomach, Bowels, Liver and Kidney diseases.Rheumatism and Blood Diseases, treated by Electro-Thermal Baths. A FEW TESTIMONIALS. The reason I run testimonials Is because It is Information for tha people, who want to know some of the people whom we have cured. Albia, Xcwa, Nov, 1, 1S05. I live six miles east of Albia and was afflicted with rupture for 40 years. I had It strangulated sev eral times BO I could not get it back. The doctors wanted to oper ate on me and said there was no other way to be cured, but I would not be operated on, and finally the rupture went back. I suffered se vere pain from the rupture and did not get. any relief until I went to Dr. Bonham, who said he could enre me. I was treated over a year ago and was soon cured, and have not worn a truss for some time and feel very well, and have no trouble whatever. H. M. Chldester. Albia, la., April 1, 1906. I desire to say that Dr. Bonham of Ottumwa cured me of a rupture of long standing. I was cured some eight years ago and would not take any amount of money and be as I was before. I can recommend his treatment to all sufferers. W. B. Campbell. Stomach diseases are very com mon diseases. We are curing many by the use of Electricity and Vibra tion, which stimulates the circula tion of the parts and brings about normal action. OTTUMWA. IOWA. AINLEY VIOLIN IS AN OLD ONE William Ainley, nephew of Joseph Ainley, who came to Ottum wa from England In October, and is now residing on Myrtle street, Is the possessor of a valuable violin which was 46 years old when the American revolution broke out. The Inscription on the Interior, stamped by the maker and where a forgery could not be made after the instru ment had been put together 's "Antonlus Stradivarius Crermonenfia, Faciebat Anno," and the date "1729."' The instrument was manufactured by the Bame man that turned out the old violin of J. A. Koett of 411 North street, Oskaloosa. The Ainley In strument is one year older neverthe less than the Koett violin. Following is an account of the Koett violin from the Oskaloosa Her ald: Koett Violin. J. A. Koett of 411 North street, an employe of t.he OBkaloosa Saddlery Co., is the owner of a valuable heir loom, a high grade violin whlclj was made in Germany In 1730, only a lit tle over a hundred years after the Pil Si'im Fathers first stepped upon Amer ican sell at Plymouth Rock, forty-five years before the War of the Revolu tion broke out, and forty-six years be fon ihe thirteen colonies of the Unt ed t-tates declared their independ ence. The instrument is not only a curious and interesting relic, but a most valuable and sweettoned instru ment which, under the direction of its master, can still speak to the soul in its clear, melodious music. The authenticity of its age is proven by the manufacturer's stamp on the in terior of t.he sound board where it would be impossible for an Imposter to change or forge the date after the instrument was completed. The la bel bears the maker's name, "Anton lus Stradivarius C-emonenfla, Facie bat Anno," and the date, "1730." Purchased in Germany. The violin was purchased over forty years ago from a German, by Mr. Koett's father, who was a musician cf renown practically all of his life.
