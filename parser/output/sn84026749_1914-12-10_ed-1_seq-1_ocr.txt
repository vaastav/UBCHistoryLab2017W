AWAITS ORDER FO II ATTACK ASKS CONGRESS TO URGE TRUCE FOR CHRISTMAS An appeal to the warring nations to declare a twenty days' truce was the gist of a reso lution offered today by Sena tor Kenyon of Iowa. He pro posed that Congress should ask. the countries to refrain from fighting during the Christmas holiday season. In presenting his resolution, Senator Kenyon said it had the support of churches, re gardless of denomination, calling attention to the fact that the Pope had gone on record for it and that it was being discussed by Protestant congregations. EMPLOYES MAY YET E President Will Read Regulation " for Half-Holidays Promul gated by McReynolds. Federal employes have jet a chance to be granted half-holidays in vhlch to "shop early" on the two Saturdays pre ceding Chrlstmap. Those in the employ of the District government are practically assured of an extra holiday in addiUon to Christ mas and New Year's Day. Concerning the holiday periods re quested for the employes of the Fed eral Government. President Wilson Is reconsidering the Issuance of an execu tive order relieving the employes of their duties on the days designated in the request. He refused to Issue such an order several days ago. It became known today that It is the desire of the Commissioners to grant a holday to the employes within tntir Jurisdiction, on December 25 and Jan uary 2. As Christmas and New "lear Day fall on Friday this would give the employes a three-day holiday each week, but whether tho board has au thority for this action is not yet decided. Why eH Refused. President Wilson's refusal to act In the matter of granting the request for the half-holidays was based solel.. on what he believed to be a lack of author ity. The fact that It I'. Andrews, presi dent of the Retail Merchants' Assocla ciatlon. has been able to unearth a provision In tht District code cover ing the subject will, it Is thought, have much weight with the Chi- f Executive. A copy of the law, wuh an opinion on it rendered in August, 1913, by Attornev General Mclei olds. Is now on the President's desk and will be read by him this evening. If he considers the authority hurtl clent he probabl will issue tht x ecuttve order tomorrow f-o the clerks might have the prUllego of early shopping next s-'aturda The opinion of Attorney General Mc Reynolds reads as foJows: "Every Saturday after 1- o'clock noon is a holiday for all purposes within the District of Columbia, anil is there for one of the days declared publle holi days by law within the meaning of the statuts regulating the number of hours of labor which must be required of all clerks and eniployes in the executive departments, conse.iu ntly heads of de partments are not obligated to require labor of such clerks, eti .. after the hour of noon on Saturday " The code Is the one approved March 3. 1S01. and amended January 31 and June 20, 1592. Informed the Merchants. The Comtniusioners have informed the Retail Merchants' Asscolation that they cannot give the emplojes a half holiday on December 12 ami Dei em ber 1!. The conclusion reached l the hoard is that it would not le iiistillwd In making such an order. The association was reminded that the emplcjes of the District govern ment are relieved from duty at 3 p.m. every Saturday, an hour and a half earlier than those of the Federal gov ernment, and. therefore, are afforded an opportunity l. do their Christmas shopping turly. The Commissioners are familiar with that section of the District code which declares every Saturday after 12 o'clock noon a holiday, but are given authority to demand a contin uance of servcie after that hour.

LONDON, Dec. 10. Kaiser Wilhelm was racked by a severe coughing spell early today and was relieved only after the court physicians and the Empress, who was sum moned to his bedside, had administered to him for nearly an hour, reports reaching London by way of Amsterdam, assert. It is now accepted in every quarter that the condition of the Kaiser is serious. It is evident that the strictest censorship is being exercised by the German government. Reports of his majesty's illness have come from nu merous different points. His ailments are variously de scribed as influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, and nervous prostration.
