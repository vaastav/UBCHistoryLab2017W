J ( ' t News and Citizen MORRISVILLE AND HYDE PARK. L. H. LEWIS, EDITOR WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1905. Gov. Bell is spending a few days in Chicago and Lieut.-Gov.Stearnsis acting as Governor. What if Charlie should grant Mrs. Rogers a reprieve? We give elewhere a synopsis of President Roosevelt's message read in Congress yesterday. The message in its entirety is a long one, but in the condensed form we give it makes pretty good reading. Our readers will no doubt appreciate this oppor tunity of getting the gist of the message. The Free Press savs that because Gov. Bell endorsed W. W. Miles for a judgeship when McCullough was Governor, was reason enough forap- nointinc him at this time. H that is so, why did the Governor set a day for hearing the friends of the various other candidates? With the ap pointments of Miles "up his sleeve'' it would seem that this latter movement was hardly necessary. In its issue of December 1st the Enosburg Standard imparts the news that Gov. Bell " was a guest of honor at the christening of the new battleship Vermont at Quincy, Mass., on Aug. 31st." Three months after the event happened is hardly in keep ing with these days of telephones, wireless telegraphv, etc., as well as the Standard's usual" promptness in publishing the news. Where were you at, Brer. Rose? Congressman Foster will no doubt be the recipient of a large number of boquets from the school ma'ams of 1 he district of Washington for the in troduction of the bill increasing their salaries. A whole avalanche of posies would also be tossed to Litn if he could in some way do a like service for the school mr.'ams in his own Vermont, where the pay is de cidedly small. Could the wages be increased School Directors would not have the great trouble they do in finding competent persons for teach ers. The eight hour plan is not popular among the farmers, whose daily work during a large part of the year. is nearer double that period. At the recent convention of the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry a resolution directed against the short hour movement was adopted. It set forth the belief of the organization that "it is every man's privilege to work as many hours as he will for pay ; that energy, thrift and activity are entitled to encouragement and should command lightful compensa tion for services rendered." Good enough doctrine his for everybody, no matter what their occupation may be. IN THE 

SECOND DISTRICT. An interesting letter on Vermont politics appeared in the Boston Herald of Sunday last. Besides dis cussing the Governor question the matter of the next Congressman from the 2d district was treated to a large extent. The writer expressed the opinicn that Gov. Bell might play a prominent part therein much to the discomfiture of Kittrulge Haskins, the present incumbent, and Hon. Frank Plumley, who has an eye on the position. Gov. Bell is an enigma to many of the politicans in that district and that he is creating some uneasiness among the friends of the two gentlemen named aboveis quite true. Whether he is after the place, and could he win out, are droblems not easily solved. It is true that the Governor has a strong following, and were both Haskins and Plumley in the field, he might win, but if one or the other step aside the Governor might find the contest a lively one, especially if he measured swords with the gentle man from NorthGeld. The West Point-Annapolis football game ended in a draw, operations being suspended owing to the coming oidarkncss. Jhesituation issugges tivc of the evenness with which the two are matched.

The darkness deepen Lord with me a hide When other helpers fail and coin torts Are, Help of the helpless, O, abide with me." Pure and clear at first rang the tones of the old hymn of faith and trust. A girl was dying on the white iron operating table of a Chicago hospital. She was singing. And then, fainter and fainter, grew the voice, until the songdied away in a whisper. The girl was dead. She had chanted her own requiem. Beautiful and brave Clara Butler, soprano of the Morgan Park Baptist church at that city, had been thrown by accident under the wheels of a train and was hurried to thehospital in the hope of saving her life Dy an operation1 in vain. Miss Butler knew that death was closing down upon her life. She whispered a messagefor her relatives, who were in an adjoining room, and said with a smile, " Tell them that I am not afraid to die." And then her glorious voice, a voice that had wafted the souls of devout worshippers above the things of time and sense, floated through the operating rooms. Surgeons and nurses turned away to, the windows as the dying girl sang over and over again the one stanza of her favorite song. Their eyes were wet. The gii I's soul was in her voice that now faltered and died avay in a whisper as the dark waters closed about her. " Abide with me," You don't believe as the girl be lieved? Superstition ? Deception? Re flex influence, etc., etc. But she was brave! And something helped to still the awful agony in the face of death. Disbeliever, agnostic, or what not, are you not glad the girl gotstrength from some source as the life ebbed away from her poor mangled body ? Sure. You would no more take away such a nope ot dying iuitli than you would knock the crutches from beneath a cripple. "Help of the helpless, 0 abide with me." Are you quite prepared to say the prayer was unanswered? The proposition to -change inau guration tlav from the fourth of March to the last Thursday in April is a sensible one and ought to be adopted. March is one cf the most trying, uncertain and disagreeable months known to Washington cli mate and the sickness and death which always result from the ex posure incident to inauguration day calls loudly for a change. Give us smiling, pleasant April instead of raw, uncertain, blustering March.

It is sold in almost all the civilized coun tries of the globe. If the cod iish became extinct it would be a world-wide calam ity, because the oil that comes from its liver surpasses all other fats in nourishing mid life-giving properties. Thirty years ago the proprietors of Scott's Emul sion found a way of preparing cod liver oil so that everyone can take it and get the full value of the oil without the objectionable taste. Scott's Emulsion is the best thing in the world for weak, backward children, thin, delicate people, and all conditions of wasting and lost strength. Scntf for tree sample.

He shows that the is land is lawfully subject to Cuban control, and these residents are bound to obey the laws of the Cuban Repub lic as long as they remain in the island. If they fail in that obedience, they are liable to prosecution and punishment. The treaty now pend ing before the Senate, the Secretary points out, only "accords to Cuba what is hers in accordance with inter national law and justice. " For cen turies the island has been part of Cuba and never been territory of the United States. This country will not com pel the transfer of the island to Ameri can control.
