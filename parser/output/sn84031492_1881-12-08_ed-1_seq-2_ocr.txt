SILVER. ANGUY COMMENTS ON THE MESSAGE fpecfiU Dticnreh to The Chicago Tribune. Washington, D. C., Dec. 7.—The message nns been a subject of much more general comment today Ilian it was yesterday. Tho document was so long that very few of tho members listened to it in either House, and it was not generally read until late Inst night or this morning. Tim views which are ex pressed today, therefore, are better consid ered and of more value than tlio fugitive comments which werc.made Inst night in tho columns of alleged interviews held with men who presumed to discuss a document with the contents of which they were not ac quainted. While the message generally is favorably regarded as a literary composi tion, and as « state paper which bears Inter nal evidence ot having been prepared almost solely by President Arthur’s own hand, and us expressing frankly and aggressively tho views of its author, many of those views are nut well- received by a very considerable number of Congressmen. THE 

FRIENDS OF THE SILVER DOLLAR, for instance, and of tlio double standard are not only united in their opposition, hut nro even bitter and heated in their denunciation ot the position which tho. President takes upon tills subject. They insist that ids argu ments as to tho inability to maintain tlio double standard nro sutiicieutiv answered by the fact tlfut Urn double standard has been successfully maintained without any strain upon tlio Government machinery or upon ttio National credit, and that no species of currency is at present In so great demand at tho Treasury ns tlio very silver cortlllcatcs which Secretary Folgcr’s report aliects so much to despise. All through Uie Western, South, and Southwestern country, where exchange Is costly and expressage expensive, silver certificates are in great demand as a convenient medium of exchange, and u proposition to withdraw them from circula tion, and TO 

CANCEL THE SILVER-HOLLAR LAW under which tliuy me issued, will meet with earnest ami unanimous condemnation. Tho statement that tlio silver dollar Is not In cir culation is specious, for, while a large per centage of these'dollars is In tho Treasury vault, they nro simply there ns a basis for tho circulation of the certificates which circulate throughout Uio country on a pur with gold, and are, In fact, in many quarters greatly preferred to gold. Tlio silver dollars are all in circulation in point of fact, either in them selves or through their representatives, and ttie supporters of Uie Bilvcr-Dollar law very much regrot that the Administration should have chosen to introduce A mSTUICUING ELEMENT tutu tho IJmmclul situation, and have Invited antagonism within tho Republican party, which time mid tho success of a bimetallic system, it was thought,.iind successfully re moved. Thu recommendations of the Presi dent on tills subject, mm tho still more severe comments of tho Secretary of tho Treasury, can only serve to be a source of agitating discussion, us tho most radical monometatllst will not hazard the opinion that such recommendation can havo any con siderable hilluence to Initiate'a movement for the repeal of tho Sllvur-Uollnr law. No one expects that that law will bo repealed, or that any attempts to modify it will prove successful In this Congress; but tho recom mendations may serve to create an unneces sary llnanclul agitation, mid to sow tho seeds of party or sectional dissension.

TUB PENSION EXPLOSION. IT HAS NOT KEEN AVERTED. Surest DttpaicA *o T ht Chicago rrttmne. Washington, D. C., Dee. 7.—Certain In vestigations which Commissioner Dudley lias been making In tho Pension-Office for sumo weeks culminated today in tho arrest of ono of the clerks under the charge of using tho Government's franking envelopes for private business. Tho communication which the envelope covered was a matter ot private business, and contained the further statement that tho writer was a clerk in tho Pension-Office., This arrest was simply In tho nature of a preliminary step to place tho olfender in the hands of tho law. Upon being arrested he made A PARTIAL CONFESSION, which was in accordance with tho facts which have been partially developed in tho pending Investigation. It indicates a con spiracy with several others in the Pension- Ollico and in othor departments of the Gov ernment to pass tictitious claims, and also to take money for attention to proper claims under consideration In the department. The case promises developments of a somewhat sensational character, both on account of TUB AMOUNTS INVOLVED and of the previous standing of tho parties who now nro believed to be implicated. Names and more Uctlnit statements concern ing tho case arc withheld for today, as it is be lieved by those engaged in the investigation that full publication might interfere with the full developments of the facts. This at test eonlirms tho dispatch published several weeksago solely In tho TheTriiiunr to tho ef fect tliatsuch a conspiracy was suspected,ami, hi fact, discovered, and it will be remembered tho statement was olllclnlly denied, and by no ono more vigorously than by Commis sioner Dudley himself.

Special JHtpaUh Co The Chicago Tribune. Washington, D. C., Deo. 7.—Our Govern ment has taken very decided action upon tho subject of naturalized citizens. Tho partic ular cases which have presented grounds for Its action are a those which have been before the Spanish Claims Commission. The State Department has ordered the agent of tho United Stales before that Commission to withdraw all cases now pending before that body which Involve tho question of nat uralization. The letter of tho Secretary of Stnto goes over the whole subject, stating the differences which from time to time have arisen between this Government and Spain upon this point, and declaring that the United States cannot consent that any Government shall assume to go behind the action of our courts in pronouncing citizenship, except, of course, eases where fraud may have been practiced on the court hi presenting false evidence before it JVhllo the case on which the action is hosed Is one Involving tho naturalization of a former subject of Spain, the position taken by tho Stato Department applies with equal force to THE WHOLE qUESTION OF* NATURALIZATION, no mutter from what nation the adopted citizen iimyhavecuine. Thu lust controversy with Spain has arisen In a class of claims where, after long years of controversy, Spain yielded and ordered the recognition of Amur lean citizenship wherever It had been do dared by tho courts of the United Status, but latterly, hi the adjudication of claims before the existing international Commission, tho umpire has been induced to return to the old subterfuge of defeating claims by refuchjg to rccognizu citizenship ns declared by our courts, 'fids decision is directly In tho face of positive orders heretofore given by tho Spanish Government in tho settlement of precisely similar claims. TIIK ACTION NOW TAKKN, In withdrawing all such claims from before the commission, is in pursuance of notice given early in the present year, It then being made known to thu Spanish Minister that such a course would bo token If thu status of citizens duly naturalized by our courts was called in question, The matter at that stage formed tho subject of Cabinet consultation, and tho strong clausu In the notice then given amt the position then taken was ap proved by Den. Garfield. Tho umpire in these cases silll persisting in ids position, al though it is in direct opposition to tho previ ous admissions of Spain and tho decisions of formet umpires of tho same commission, our agent has been directed lu withdraw all eases which would be affected by tills decision of the new umpire. At the same time, the Slate Department has addressed a letter to the Minister of Spain, residing here, and to Min ister Hamlin at Madrid, setting fortli at length the grounds taken by the UtiUed States In regard to naturalized citizens.

WIJTnOSI. OS A HACK SKAT. Dupotch to The Chieaoo TXbmuw Washington, D.

During tho Senator’s ab sence from tbo Senate, In tlio general over turning of tno committees, his successor, Kdgerlon, was appointed to membership on unimportant committees,and by tho Kdmunds resolution tho only place for Wlndom Is on tho committees given Kdgerlon. In tbo dis cussion of tho advisability, of any change, there seemed to be a decided feeling against reopening the committee question, and though a special committee of tho caucus was ap pointed to look Into tho matter, 7.—Speaker IT MAY OCCUR that Wlndom will find himself thrust away on minor committees. Should tills be the case, It would bn a very good Illustration of tlio old-fogy Ideas which govern the Senate, and make seniority of service, instead of merit, tho qualification for. appointment to important duties, which would place an ob scure man In the Chairmanship of one of the principal committees, and tho ablest man in tho body, representing one of the must im portant constituencies, a simple member on a minor committee.

"Washington*, IX C., Dec. 7.—A couple of rather sensational cases o£ marital unlmifpl* ness became public boro today, and will probably receive additional ventilation through the courts.
