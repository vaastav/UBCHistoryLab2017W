THE CITIZEN FRIDAY. DECEMBER . 1893 EaUr*4 it •* ■■««- " el — " ,l " WILI.IA* C. nmtrt. - p»bll»h« THS death of Gen. Lilly, one of the Con gressmenat-Large, from this state (at hi home at Mauch Chunk, last Friday), wil. necessitate the holding of a general elec tion to fill the vacancy in the Pennsylva nia delegation at Washington caused by hi> death; and Gov. Pattiton will probabh order this election to be held with the reg ular "Spring" or February Election. * Tha Republican State Convention will. to reassemble and make a nomin ation, which will be conceded to the eastern half of the state, as Majoi McDowell represents the western half. There are a peat many good men in public life in Eastern Pennsylvania but wr know of none upon whose shoulders the mantlu of a congressman would fall more fittingly than upon tiose of Jerome B. Nile* of Tioga county. His capacity has been amply proven by years of good work at Harrisburg, and he is one of the few men, long in public life, whose record is clean. Congress and the Message. The President's message was received in almost perfect silence by the senators and members Monday alternoon. It evoked hardly any semblance of applause in the House with, its nearly 100 Democratic ma jority. In fact, the coolness with which it w<u received was remarkable. All ex pected it would contain some interesting information respecting the situation in Hawaii, while not a few of the Democrats hoped it woulo give them some news on this point on which they could give the administration hearty support. Butitfurn ished nothing new. It simply nonfirmeo the un-American attitude announced b) Secretary Greeham. Another reason for the cold reception of the message was the news that it had been published in London that morning. Thi* news reached the capitol about noon and spread like wildfire. It aroused intense in dignation on all hands, Democrats and Re publicans joining in denouncing the action of the administration. Capt Boutelle of Maine said with mock surprise at the outburst of indignation: "Why, that is the right step for this admin istration to take. England is more Inter ested in his views than we are." Ex-£peaker Beed dryly remarked: "Well, if London is to remain the head quarters of this administration, our enter prising newspapers will be compelled to station their correspondents there in order to secure the latest and most reliable news from here." Mr. Sibley ol Pennsylvania said: "II that report is true, we ought not to have the mesMge read. It ought to be laid up on the table until the British house of lords had considered it." The other comments were on the same line. So disgusted were the members that there were many vacant seats while the message was being read. That night all were discussing tbe mes sage. The Republicans found many weak points upon which to successfully assail it, •while the Democrats, as a rule, evaded commenting upon it for publication. Ex-Speaker Reed said: "I dislike to comment on the message, because it wonld not be seemly to do it in adequate terms It is exceedingly disappointing both in matter and manner. It is largely made up of a wearisome resume of tbe reports of his secretaries, which they have hardly improved by condensation. On the Ha waiian question we are left as much a ever in tbe dark and must wait tbe news of tbe next steamer just as we have been waiting so long_ "That part of the message which relates to the tariff is most surprising. It assev erates that the house committee in charge ot that subject ha* formulated plans aud methods of taxation, which, a* a member of the committee, I have not even heard ptoposed. It is a rather unusual sensation to learn of the deeds of the committee, not in the committee-room, but from the President of the United States. "Haa that committee ceased even in form to bo composed of both parties and has it without the formality of a word in open committee informed the President of its determination in such way that the Presi dent can officially communicate it to the honset How long has it been part of our system that the committee is not an inde pendent branch, and above all, the com mittee which controls the puree, shall re ?ort to Congress through the President! s this the result of the rumored blending of the appointive with the legislative power? "It is bad enough to have a tariff bill made up by a little coterie—'political bill,' as Mr. Willaon calls it—but to have it com municated to the President before it reaches even the committee, still less the House, shows A determination to be moved by no facts and modified by no arguments, which makes apparent the absurdity of appoint ing Republicans on the committee of ways and inears at all." Congressman Dalzell, after carefully reading the president's remarkable docu ment, summed it op aa follows: "There are some remarkable things in connection with the president's message. In the first place, if the report that is current and gen erally believed be true that the message was published in the London morning papers prior to its transmission to congress, that U certainly a very revarkable exbibi tion of bad taste, to characterize it by no lnore appropriate term. As the tariff views of the message are in the interest of the English instead of the Ameriean people, it was perhaps thought the message was more likely to receive a favorable recep tion oa the other side of the water than here. "Aside from the manner of its publica tion the next most remarkable thing about it is its extreme length, the number of its words and the paucity of its original ideas Thirty good-sixed pbampblet pages are fill ed for the most part with figures, statistics accessible in the reports of neads of depart ments; and truly without interest in a presidential message, especially in view of the fact that in most cases they do not furnjsh the subject ot conclusion or sugges tion "upon the part of the president. "The message is remarkable for its omis sion*. Only two or three subjects of living interest i o the people are touched upon, and they only in the most ineagrn way With respect to finance, the president re commends a do-nothing p*>lioy, which per haps is wise enough at this time. His dec laration upon tbis subject is significant as conveying a warning to the free silver men not to tamper further with legislation for the present, and his suggestion as to addi tional legislation in regard to the issuauce of government bonds is especially signifi cant. In view of the fact that his party, under the guise of pretending to 'provide revenue for the government,' have devised a measure to reduce revenue some s<>o,ooo,- 000 per aunuin, it is perhaps wise that the power should be vested somewhere aud a method provided to keep us from going into national bankruptcy. "The president gives somewhat less than a page to the very interesting question of Hawaiian affairs. lie tells us, with a brutal Irankness, that a representative of the republic ot the United States has been sent to Honolulu with instructions to over throw popular government in that island, if practicable, and restore monarchy in the person of a semi barbarous queen. "The only relief that an American is likely to experience afl«r leceiving this in formation is to be found in the further in formation that the president does not know as yet whether this has been accomplished • He then i.ismisses the subject alter telling the American people that wbeu he finds out auy thing more with respect t > it, he will let tbem know. I think that a part of the mc»sage that the average American W ill recur to with a great deal of pride. "With respect to the tariff question, the president furnishes us a lot of glittering generalities and a reasuratice of some ot bis free-trade fallacies. When we hear him talk about the voice of his countrymen having epoken In favor ot tariff reform we are iuclined to belive that there has been sednlousy kept from him ttie recent news from U»»ssachutotts, Xew York. Pennsyl vania, Ohio and Io»u. He still seems to ban: ui« (>« ou toiHigu markets When those luiuigu uiaikets are and what we oou'd c'HViiy tl'.etr with, be wisely relia ns from specifying. It js gratifying to see, however, that he does not share the l)em»- rra'ir Kt'.iror of the robber-baron manu facturers. - iiu elicited* is that they shall feffe raw material!. He still stick* to the theory h \t a protective tariff enhances the cost of the manufactured article to the consumer in pite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary furnished by the opeiation of the McKinley law. It U when he comes to talk about the relation of raw materials to the wage earner, however. tbat_ the president's ignorance of facts reveals 1 self •a stupendous. When one comes to con sider the hundreds of thousands of laborers in the coal and ore mines of this country «• bo, under the provisions of hts proposed policy, will be houseless, homeless, hungry and desperate, while foreign laborers ply their places, it becomes a matter of bonder how a president of the I nited States can so tempt the credulity of the American people. . . '•The president tells us that the ways and means committee have agreed upon an income tax on certain corporate invest oenu. If this be true, the majority of the ways and means committee havecommuni ■ated a fact to the president of the United States which they have not seen fit to communicate to their col leagues of the minority. The most impor tunate inquiry upon the part of the latter nas failed up to this time to elicit any m ■iny information on the subject. Irue, under this administration there seems to t>e a strange mixing np of the fjnctions ol the different departments of government which have heretofore been supposed to bo co-ordinate.'' IT is gratifying to the Republicans of Pennsylvania to note that their interests are being carefully watched over by that distinguished statesman Congressman John Dalzell, of Pittsburgh. Not only in Penn sylvania, but throughout the entire country the greatest confidence is placed in Dalzell as the champion and defender of protection against the great majority in the present Congress. He is ranked among the ablest leaders in Congress and his advice is sought after and given the greatest weight in all matters by the Republican leaders at Washington. Alter looking at the unjust misrepresentation of Pennsylvania in the Senate it is certainly gratifying to turn to our able array of Congressmen led by the valiant Dalzell. The Democratic onslaught on the tariff will be fought at every step by Pennsylvania's able representatives in Con fess but we are sorry to state that as much cannot be expected of Pennsylvania s rep resentatives in the Senate. —Kittanning Free Press. The Tariff and Hawaii. President Cleveland's long message starts out, as usual, with a statement of onr re lations with other nations, followed by re ports on the the receipts and expenses of the National Government, the National backs, silver repeal, army and navy, sea coast defenses, the Indians.public grounds, agriculture, civil service and the tariff. His remarks on the tariff and the Wilson bill come last in the message, and are as follows. After a hard struggle tariff reform is di rectly before us Nothing so important claims onr attention, and nothing so clear ly presents itself as both an opportunity and duty—an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow-citizens, and a duty imposed upon us by our oft-repeated pro fessions, and by the emphatic mandate 01 the people. After full discussion our coun trymen have spoken in favor of this reform and they have confided the of its ac complishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it. If there is anything in the theory ol a representation in public places of the peo ple and their desires, if public officers are really the servants of the people, and ff political promises and professions have any binding force, our failure to give the relief BO long awaited will BE sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract onr attention or disturb our effort until this reform is accomplished by wise and care ful legislation. , ~ While we should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of reve nue justifies the imposition of tariff dnties and other federal taxation, and that they sbould be limited by strict economy, wo cannot close onr eyes to the fact that con ditions have grown up among ns which in justice and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our gov ernment actually demand. Manifestly, if we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should be a reduc tion in present tariff charges upon the nec essaries of life. The benefits ol Bach a reduction would be palpable and substan tial, seen and felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the will ing benefactions of a government whose highest fanction is the promotion of the welfare of the people. Noj less closely relatod to our people s p rosperiiy and well-boicg is the removal of restrictions upon the importation of the raw material necessary to our manufac turer. The world should be open to onr national ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot be while legislation through the imposition of high tariff forbids to Ameri can manufacturers as cheap materials as those used bj their competilors. It is quite obvious that the enhancement of the price of our manufactured products result ing from this policy not only confines the market for these products within our own borders to the direct disadvantage of our Own manufacturers but also increases their cost to our citizens. The interests of labor are certainly, thongh indirectly, involved in this feature of our tariff system. The sharp competi tion and active struggle among our man ufacturers to supply the limited demand for tfieir goods soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of work in mills and factories, a discharge of employes and distress in the home* of our workingmen. Even il the often-disproved assertion could be made good that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff'duties, the intelligence of our workingmen leads them quickly to discov er that their steady employment, permit ted by free raw materials, is the most im portant lactor to their relation to tariff legislation. A measure has been prepared by the ap propriate congressional committeo embody ing tariff reform on the lines herein aug gested, which will be promptly submitted for legislative action. It is the result of much patriotic and unselfish work, and I believe it deals with the subject consist ently and as thoroughly as existing condi tions permit. lam satisfied that the re duced tariff' duties provided for in the pro posed legislation, added to existing inter nal revenue taxation, will in the near fu ture, though perhaps not immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the need*,of the government. The committee, after full consideration and to provide against a temponry defi ciency which may exist before the business of the country adjusts itself to the ne*' tariff schedules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few additional internal reve nue taxes, including a small tax npon in comes derived from certain corporate in vestments. These new assessments are not only absolute just and easily borne, but they have tbe further merit of being such as can be remitted without unlavoraiile business disturbance whenever the necessi ty of their imposition no longer exists. In my g r eat desire for tbe success of this ineanure. I cannot restrain the suggestion that its success can only be attained by means of unselfish counsel on the pait of the friends ol tariff relorm and as a result of their willingness to subordinate personal desires and ambitions to tbe genoral good. The local interests affected by tbe prop >s ed reform are so nuuieroja and so varied that, if all are insisted upon, tbe legislation embodying tbe reform must inevitably fail. Regarding the Hawaiian affair be writes as follow*: It iii hardly Decennary for me to state that the i|ue*tions arising from our relation* wiili Hawaii have caused seriou* em bar ra**meut Just prior to tbe installation ol the pre*ent administration the exiting goveruinent ol Hawaii hail been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between the provisional government ol the inland* an ! the United tjlate« and Kubmittted to the *euat« lor ratiticatioD, Thi* treaty 1 withdrew fur examination and dispatched lion. Jauies U. Ulount ol Georgia to Honolulu a* a special coo-misslouer to make an impartial investigation of the circumstances attend ing the change of government, and of ail the condition* bearing npon the subject ol the treaty. Alter a thorough and exbann tive examination Ur. IJlomit submitted to me hi* report, showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with tbe active aid ol our representative to that govern ment and through the intimidation caused by the pregenco of an armed naval force of the I niled .Stale* which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our mini* tcr. Upon these fd'its developed it teemed to me the only honorable course lor our government to puroue was to undo tbe nfcnag tfekt bad uvea d<m« by tbuuo repre- Renting as and restore as far as praetible the statu* existing at the time of onr torci dle intervention. With a view of accomplishing this result , within the constitutional limits of execu tive power and recognizing all onr obliga tions and responsibilities growing out of anp changed conditions brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister in Honolulu has appro priate instructions to that end. _ Thus far no information of the accomplishment of any definite results hare been received from him. . Additional advices are soon expected. When received they will be promptly sent to congress, together with all other Infor mation at hand, accompanied by a special executive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to a oomplete understand ing of the case, and presenting a history of all the material events leading up to the present situation. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government fr° m all sources during the fiscal year June SO 1893, amonnted to $461.<_16 061 and itn expenditures to $459.3(4 6j4 29 There was collected from customs s2oo Jo.>.- 016 73. and fr.m internal revenue $161,- 027,623 93 Onr dutiable imports amonut ed to $421,856,711, an increase of $02.- 453,907 over the preceding year, and im portations free ol duty amounted to $444,- 544,211. a decrease from the preceding y ear of $13,455,447. Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding year by $7,147,445 32, .... , The total tax collected on distilled spirits was $94,720,260 55, on manufactur ed tobacco $31,889,711 74, and on ferraen ted liquors $32 548.983 01. We exported merchandise during the year amounting to $847,666,194 a decrease of from the preceding years. The amount ot gold exported was larger than any previous year in the history of the government, amounting to 

SIOB 680,844. and exceeding the amount exported during the preceding year by $58,485,517. The sum paid from the treasury for s igar bounty was $9.37 a . 88, an" increase over the preceding year of $2,033,053.09. It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 30, 1f94, will be $430.121.365 38, and its ex penditures $458.121,365 38, resulting lu a deficiency ol $28,000,000.

WAITE of Colorado, in accordance with the recall of the lato election in that state, has issued a proclamation giving the women of the state the right to vote at all elections. THE FARMERS' INSTITUTE, Flying throngh, what to us, is infinite space; with its mantle of air, which alone js free to all mankind; and its surface ol soil and water, on which we live; is the planet we call the Earth. The products of this Jiarth keep us alive for our appointed time, and after death the Earth absorbs our bodies as completely aa it does any other of nature's elements. It is the father, and the mother, and the ancestor of all of us—we are part and par cel of it. The cultivation of the soil of this planet is the natural and necessary work of perhaps one-half of the human raoe, and probably always will be. Tbis work was done m ages gone by in a careless manner, and with crude implements that suited the re quirements ol tbe times; but the domina tion of the white race, and its tremendous increase, the natural desire to annihilate drudgtry so far as possible, the mechanical inventions and the chemical discoveries have now brought about such conditions in farming, as in every other branch of indus try, that perfection alone insures complete success. It was the desire to attain such perfec tion that led to the establishment of the State Hoard of Agriculture, with an exper imental station; and an appropriation sufficient to defray the expenses oi holding institutes or mo etings of fartrers in each county in the state. The Institute for this county met in the Court House in Butler on Friday morning lait, the Ist inst., and was called to order by W. 11. H. Riddle, Esq., member of the Board for this county, and to whom must be given great credit for his untiring ef forts to create au interest in the work in tbis county —efTorts that at last have met with unqualified success. Friday last was our first winter weather day, and at the opening of the session that morning but few farmers were present, but th ey came strolling in from all over the county, until by noon there was a fair attendance. Hon. D. B. Douthett was elected Presi dent, and iu his opening remarks said we were all laborers and pnducers.and that the tanner produced the great bnlk of the food products. Messrs A D. Weir, Christie Robb, James Stephenson and Benj. Douthett were elected Vice Presidents, and J. A. McCafferty, of Herman, Secre tary. Jainuc M- Galbreatb, Esq., made the ad dress of welcome. He said, in part, that the Earth was the mother of us all,that we all prayed "Give us this day our daily bread," that tho farmers should organize to secure legislation in their favor, that we should realize that we are living in a great age, t iat one man can do as much work now a< six could thirty years ago, that we sh-iuld re-adjust ourselves to tbe new con ditions, that to be successful we must look to tho future; that these institutes were evidences that the farmer was beginning to appreciate himself, etc. J. A. McCafferty responded in an elo quent description of the age we live in, which he thinks excells those of ancient times, hoped tbe institnte would be a suc cess, etc. Judge Weir read an essay on'wheat col tore,stating his method of treating the soil before and alter cropping. He believes in rolling after drilling, and has made a suc cess ol wheat raising. He stated that this county produced 600,000 bushels of wheat annually, which Could be increased to a million. Dr. Irvine gave his experience with fer tilizer-.; and Isaac Ash said it was not prof itable to raise wheat on a small tarm here, bnt Judge Weir stated that the wheat acreage of this oonnty averaged bettel than those of all the States of the Union, excepting two, also th*t tbe average in this State was between 14 and 15 bushels, wljile the reports of the threshers of thin County made it 20 bushels, and it could utlely be put at 18. Ho thinks cros»- drillmg is not desirable. J. M. McOollough also read au essay on wheat culture. lie believes in early and thorou h plowing and harrowing, also )u dragging the ground to breik lumps, plows his manure under, uses 200 pounds of commercial fertilizer to the acre, keeps his seed clean, drills in September, thiuks the drills protect the plants, favors deep plowing, uses Foltz a heal, does not favor tall rolling though soil uiay make a differ ence. T. B. Terry, of Hudson, Ohio, (a town about 'JO mile* south of Cleveland; ban Usui a roller for 124 year*, but he roll* be lore drilling and not after; ho get* from 30 to 85 bushel* an acre, and think* hi**nlkey cultivator with which he harrow* th« ground ov«r and over again is responsible lor from 10 to 13 bushel* of it, he uses clean grain even if he has to go over it by hand, hi* wheat, which is only the old Koltz selected and cleaned, ht* a reputa tion and he well* it at an advance, be pre frr* a dose drill (say 7 inches) bnt gets just a* good results from broadcasting il the soil 1* well prepared; be ha* produced 35 bushels to the acre year alter year. ile thinks a "little farmer" can not allord to do without good tools, as delays often cost more than the tools. He sows about I bu. and ■» i|ts. to the acre between the 10th and loth of September (a little more il sown later) and drills in about 2 irebe*. Secretary Edge stated that #13,000,000 was spent yearly in thin Htate lor com mercial fertilizer*. That the be»t were I tfonrjfcrttd uf /tr/<l*bvri'o acid, ami ammonia: that nobody should pay mor« than $1 for each percent of phosphoric acid that South Carolina bone was uo (food; that the farmers of each locality should club to gether. find out what fertilizer best suited their soil and buy it at wholesale. James M Douthett read an essay on farm improvements. He favors placing the buildings near the road side, with ample grounds, buildings arranged to save labor, and all made as beautiful as possible. He believes in comfortable and pleasant homes, thinks worm fences are a nuisai o etc. N'uon told a brick or frame school house story, and Edge followed it with one about the red or blue dress. _ Mr. Terry then talked on clover. He is a great believer in clover and well he may be if he gets the results he says he does. He sa>» he can grow twice as much clover on an acre as timothy, and that it is worth one-third more for feriilizer. He pract Cis a three year rotation on his little larui (a hilly one) in northern Ohio —clover, pota toes and wheat; says clover is worth one tnird more for teed" than timothy and that a pound of clover hay equals a pound of oats; be cuts his clover when in full bloom or soon after; he feeds clover to his horses, ie. small feed morning, small feed noon and all ttiey will eat at night if tht-y are working; feeds no oats or limothy to his horses and they are always in good con dition; has done it for eleven years; clover gets its nitrogen from the air, clover fur nishes more than twice the plant food to th; land as compared with timothy, clover sends its roots into the subsoil and brings up substance from the farm below the oue jou are tilling; in porous soil he has traced clover roots down eight feet; clover keeps the farm up, shades the land and makes it richer; clover land must be drain ed; commercial fertilizers do his clover laud no good, he has tried it up to 1 500 pounds to the acre; he sows a bushel of clover seed to six acres; sows as soon as the frost is out of the ground; don't barrow after; uses common clover; would use ma nure or fertilizer for the first crop—Heaves are produced by coughing which ruptures the air cells of the horse's lungs; sprinkles water on the clover ba_> if dusty; feuds but 8 or 10 pounds morning and noon, at night all they want if working; mows in after noon, cures in winrow next day and haals in next; rakes same way he mows and turus up but*; land can be made sick by too much clover; lengthen rotation; use potash or lime; has a barometer and seldom gets bay caught in rain; keeps his land busy and surface shaded. He harrows down the second growth of clover. Jos. L. Purvis read an essay on drain ing land. He uses tilefi to 8 inches in di ameter, places the laterals 25 to 50 feet apart and 3to 4 feet deep. Draining im proves wet land, makes it warmer. T. K. Carskaddon of West Virginia told how he irrigated his farm down there, but the subject did not seem to interest the audience very extensively. Nixon wanted to know how much phos phate an old horse would make, and said DO only got 12 for one the other day. Sec'y Edge said acid could not be used on w hole bones, that tbey must first be bro ken with a hammer, when they could be treated with acid and mixed with wood ashes, there should be a bone mill in every neighborhood, an old threshing machine would do. During the afternoon and evening sessions Misses Heulah Tiinblin and Nellie Nixon recited. Friday evening Mr. Carskaddon made a spirtied address against the over-capit alization of corporations,anu combination of capital, and favored the forming of a new party to slop it, though he could not say how it was u» be done. Mr Terry told of several mean things that he had known married men to do (none that the women did) and made an argument for the equal rights of husband and wite as partners in life. Saturday morning, James Magee, of \ a lencia, read an essay on dairying. He recommended good cows and keeping them cleaL; thinks dairy farmers should get rid of middle men, and that the future lor Butler county farmers is in the dairy. Cleanliness is the great point in keeping cows, he has a stable without stalls, ties to rings sliding on upright iron rods; cows staud on plank about feet long, w 'th trench 7x22 inches behind them Seu'y Edge said that in Cheater county 2f>o pounds ol butter per year was a lair aver agt*;aud gave his experience in furnishing butter to the Continental Hotel in f'hila delpbia. His butter was "docked" 8 cts. a pound once because he led his cows tur nips, but as they were paying him 75 cts a pound for it he could well afford the uiis take. He also gave his tests with corn, fertilizing each alternate double row with different fertilizers. Nixon gave the Prospect Creamery a put! and called for somebody to reud rules lor butter making but nobody responded. A Babcock nnlk teeter was placed on a table in view ol the audience und four samples of milk fioin different cows tested and the result shown to the audience. J. I). Harbison read an essay on raining potatoes. Mr. Harbison is one of the most successful potato raiders in the county, and Uy bis method, all ol which we could not hear distinctly, he makes that crop pav Alter lie digs his potatoes he seeds the ground to wheat. Mr. Terry gave hi# experience in taking care of sued potatoes, whict* should be kepi at such a temperature as to prevent theiu from sprouting. He keeps them ou a rais ed floor in the cellar, or in long narrow pits, covered with straw. Scabby potatoes should be immersed in water in which 2 ~■/ of pulverized corrosive sublimate for each 15 gallons of water has been dissolved The sublimate should first be dissolved in a pail of hot water. He cuts seed with one ejeand plants immediately. He uses a narrow, a weeder aud a one horse cultiza tor on hi# plants, and cultivates as long as he can. Weeds absorb moisture He raises potatoes at 15 cents a bushel or #3O an acre aud gets them off in time for wheat. Uses clover sod for potatoes, no manure, ases the manure on the clover, plows the clover sod in the spring; don't believe in much hilling; plants his early potatoes 32 inches apart, and his late 30 inches; changes seed every 2or 3 years; the first sprouts are belter because stronger and produce fewer but larger potatoes; and he lurrows with a double, sulkey, right aud left plow, to gain lime Noah Henry gave„hia experience in gar (letting for market. He believes in gsod ground, kept in good condition and well lortilized; said that winter grown cabbage seed wan the best for early planting aud better than hot bed need. Late cabbage should be set out about the Ist of July Karly beets, radishes, etc. should be sown as soon as the ground is ready, and tor a succession every 2 two weeks; nitrate ot soda is good for onions. Secretary Edge said that if anybody was cheated iu fertilizers it v.as their own lault. The law required all manufacturers lo send an analysis of their goods to the Hoard, and also to put it on the packages; and besides Ibis samples of the slull were were soul to the Hoard from dlllereut parts til the ttalo licenses lo make fertilizer were granted and persons caught cheating were iiable to flues Simeon Nixon made one of his character i»tie addresses with "Fureßta" for his text, lie believes in planting fruit and nut tree* along the highways, also in planting or chards on the north Hide of the hill and babies, cats and chickens on the Houlh aide, hut he don't believe in niilliouarc'H.
